                                  Introductory

   Many readers of the Bible treat it as though it were like a
   "puzzle-picture," where we have to "find a face," or "a man," or some
   other object. No matter what part of the Bible may be read, the one
   object seems to be to "find the Church." For, the "Word of truth" not
   being rightly divided, or indeed divided at all, the whole Bible is
   supposed to be about every one, in every part, and in every age; and
   the Church is supposed to be its on pervading subject.

   This arises from our own natural selfishness. "We" belong to the
   Church, and therefore all "we" read "we" take to ourselves, not
   hesitating to rob others of what belongs to them. Here is a case in
   point. Open your Bibles at Isa. xxix. and xxx., and at the headings of
   the pages, at the same opening we read, "Judgment upon Jerusalem," and
   "God's mercies to His Church"! This is a "dividing" of the word (by
   man) indeed! but whether it is "rightly dividing" is another matter.
   The book is declared to be "The vision of Isaiah...which he saw
   concerning Judah and Jerusalem." And yet in spite of this, the
   blessings spoken of Judah and Jerusalem are taken away and given to the
   Church, while the curses and judgments are kindly left for "Judah and
   Jerusalem!"

   On this system of interpretation the Bible is useless for the purposes
   of Divine revelation. It is made a derision to its enemies, a ground
   for the attacks of infidels, while it becomes a stumbling-block to its
   friends. And yet it is on this same principle that the Apocalypse is
   usually treated. Everywhere the Church is thrust in : John (in ch. iv.
   1) represents the Church; the living creatures, or Cherubim (ch. iv.)
   are the Church; the four and twenty elders (ch. iv., v.) are the
   Church; the 144,000 (ch. vii.) are the Church; [1] the great multitude
   (ch. vii.) is the Church; the "woman clothed with the sun" (ch. xii.)
   is the Church; the man-child (ch. xii.) is the Church; the bride (ch.
   xix.) is the Church; the "New Jerusalem" (ch. xxi.) is the Church; the
   "seven churches" are the Church; and so they go on, until the humble
   reader of the book is bewildered and disheartened. No wonder the book
   is neglected. The wonder would be if it were not.

   Now, it is with the object of lifting those who desire to understand
   this prophecy out of the quagmire of tradition that we propose to write
   these papers.

   We believe we shall best accomplish our object by departing from the
   usual custom of expositors, and leaving the interpretation of words and
   sentences and verses until after we have learned the scope of the book,
   and ascertained the great principle on which all interpretation must be
   based.

   Let us say at once that we believe, and must believe (1), that God
   means what He says; and (2), that He has a meaning for every word that
   He says. All His works and all His words are perfect, in their choice,
   order and place: so perfect, that, if one word or expression is used,
   there is a reason why no other would have done.

   On these lines we shall proceed to put forth and explain our theses or
   propositions: begging our readers not to start at the bare statement of
   them, but prayerfully to test the reasons which we shall give; and to
   remember that, while some are sufficient of themselves to establish our
   position, yet, we depend on the cumulative evidence of the whole of
   them taken together.

   Our great fundamental proposition - which we may as well state at once
   - is, that

   The Church is not the subject of the Apocalypse.

   However startling this may sound and may seem to some of our readers,
   we implore you not to dismiss it, but to test the reasons we shall give
   by the Word of God itself, and to weigh them in "the balances of the
   sanctuary." Try to forget all that you have "received by tradition,"
   and ask from whom you learned this or that. Be prepared and ready to
   unlearn anything that you may have received from men, and learn afresh
   from the Word of God itself.

   The first chapter furnishes us with fifteen proofs of our fundamental
   proposition.

   Our first point, in proof of our great proposition, is
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FIVE-FOLD DIVISION OF THE BIBLE.

   The whole Bible is divided into five great divisions, each determined
   by its subject-matter.

   1. The Old Testament has for its subject the King and his coming
   Kingdom, in promise and prophecy.

   2. The Four Gospels the Kingdom offered and rejected. The King
   crucified by Israel in the Land.

   3. The Acts and earlier Pauline Epistles; the King and Kingdom
   re-offered (iii. 19-21); and rejected, by the Dispersion in Rome (Acts
   xxviii. 25, 26).

   4. The Later Pauline Epistles. The Kingdom in abeyance. The King made
   Head over all things to the Church.

   5. The Apocalypse. The Kingdom set up with Divine judgment, in
   Power-Glory. The King enthroned.

   Then, during the fourth of these, we have the Epistles relating to the
   Mystery - the Church of God - during this present interval, while the
   King is in heaven and His Kingdom is in abeyance; and, while the
   preaching of "the gospel of the kingdom" is suspended, and "the gospel
   of the grace of God" is proclaimed. Of course, if there is no
   difference between these two pieces of "good-news," and the kingdom is
   the same thing as the Church or Body of Christ, then there is an end of
   the whole matter; not merely of our task, but of the Bible itself. For,
   if words do not mean what they say when used of a plain, literal,
   matter of fact like this, then words are useless for the purposes of
   revelation altogether. We have concealment and confusion in its place;
   and an Apocrypha instead of an Apocalypse.

   But, believing in the perfection of God's words, and not merely of his
   Word, we submit that we have here a first great reason for our
   proposition, that the Church (the body of Christ) is not the subject of
   the Apocalypse.

   It will be easier to receive this when we come to accumulate the
   evidence. We submit this first reason, simply asking our readers to
   believe what God says.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE HEBREW CHARACTER OF THE BOOK.

   Though this may be considered by some as a minor point, it is so
   important that it must not be passed over.

   Most critical commentators have to deal with it: because from the
   earliest times the enemies of the Book have made use of this undeniable
   fact in order to argue that it has no right to a place in a Canon of
   the other Greek Books of the New Testament!

   The Hebrew character of the book is shown in its use of idioms,
   expressions, words and phrases, which cannot be called Greek; and
   indeed is called by many "bad Greek."

   Professor Godet in his Studies on the New Testament, says, p. 331: "The
   only serious objection that can be urged against the authenticity of
   the Apocalypse, lies in the difference which is observable between its
   style, and that of the fourth Gospel. The latter is free from Aramaic
   expressions, the former is saturated with them." And again (p. 351),
   "the Apocalypse bears, from one end of it to the other, the character
   of a Hebrew prophecy."

   The argument based on this fact by the opponents of the Apocalypse is
   dealt with by scholars in various ways. But the subject is not one
   which would be of general interest to grammar. Those who wish to see
   the subject exhaustively treated are referred to the Commentary on the
   Apocalypse, by Moses Stuart, who devotes over twenty pages to it (pp.
   190-210).

   There is however another side to the question: and that is, that, while
   the enemies use the fact against the Book itself, we use it against the
   popular interpretation of it. Though the language is Greek, the
   thoughts and idioms are Hebrew; and this links it on, not to the
   Pauline epistles, but to the Old Testament, and shows that its great
   subject is God's final dealings with the Jew and the Gentile; and not
   the Church of God.

   Connected with this fact there is another, that emphasizes it in a
   remarkable manner. It is not only Hebrew in character as to its
   linguistic peculiarities, but especially in its use of the Old
   Testament. Only those who have most intimate acquaintance with the Old
   Testament can properly understand the Apocalypse. But all who know
   anything of old Testament history cannot fail to detect the almost
   constant reference to it.

   All the imagery - the Temple, the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant,
   the Altar, the Incense, the heads of the twenty-four courses of Priests
   (the pattern of which David's was a copy, I Chron. xxviii. 19, see
   chap. xxv., and compare Heb. ix. 23, etc), all this belongs peculiarly
   to Israel.

   The same may be said of the judgments, which follow on the lines of the
   plagues of Egypt, and therefore are to be just as real: indeed they are
   to exceed in dread reality those which were executed in the Exodus from
   Egypt. For it is written (Ex. xxxiv. 10) - "And he said, Behold, I make
   a covenant: before all they people I will do marvels, such as have not
   been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among
   which thou art shall see the word of the lord; for it is a terrible
   thing that I will do with thee." It is the fulfilment of this covenant
   with Israel which is the great subject of the Apocalypse.

   But it is when we come to look at the literary connection between the
   Old Testament and the Apocalypse that we find evidences of the most
   striking kind.

   If we count up the number of Old Testament passages quoted or alluded
   to in the New Testament, [2] we find that the gospel of Matthew has a
   very large number, amounting in all to 92. The Epistle to the Hebrews
   comes higher still with 102. Now both these books are connected in a
   special manner with Israel. Matthew, it is universally admitted, stands
   out among the four Gospels as being specially Jewish in its character.
   And the Epistle to the Hebrews was specially written to Hebrews, and
   they are addressed as such.

   Now, when we turn to the Apocalypse, what do we find? The result which
   to our mind is overwhelming. No less than 285 references to the Old
   Testament. More than three times as many as Matthew, and nearly three
   times as many as the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   We ask whether this does not give the book of Revelation a very special
   connection with the Old Testament, and with Israel? It is undoubtedly
   written about the people of the Old Testament who are the subjects of
   its history. These will understand it as Gentile Christians can never
   hope to do. [3]

   We are merely stating certain important facts which must be taken into
   account by any who are seeking to find out what the Book of Revelation
   is all about. The facts exist, and the question is, What do they say to
   us?

   Not until we discover this, and thus learn the scope of the book, can
   we hope to understand it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] We take the lists as given in Bagster's Bible.

   [3] It is most remarkable that at the present time, 1900, a movement
   has been commenced in Palestine to overcome the difficulty arising from
   the fact of Jews assembling in Palestine speaking different languages.
   Hebrew is to be made and to become the common vernacular! It is not
   only to be taught in all the Jewish schools, but all other subjects are
   to be learnt in Hebrew. With this fact must be stated another, and that
   is the recent wide-spread publication of the Salkinson-Ginsburg Hebrew
   New Testament by the Trinitarian Bible Society and the Mildmay Mission
   to the Jews, amounting to some three-quarters of a million copies.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE CHURCH NOT THE SUBJECT OF OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECY.

   Closely connected with this foregoing point, that the book is Hebrew in
   character, and intended specially for Hebrews, is another undoubted
   fact, that the Church of God is not the subject of the Old Testament,
   either in history, type, or prophecy.

   Passages, &c., may be found there and used to illustrate what is
   subsequently revealed. But this can be done only by way of application,
   and not by way of teaching or of interpretation.

   Because, of the "Mystery" or the secret concerning the Church of God,
   we are told that it "was kept secret since the world began" (Rom. xvi.
   25). That "in other ages it was not made known unto the sons of men"
   (Eph. iii. 5). That is, "from the beginning of the world, hath been hid
   in God" (Eph. iii. 9). That it "hath been hid from ages and from
   generations, but now is made manifest to the saints" (Col. i. 26).

   These statements are "the true sayings of God," and not our own. We
   have no choice but to believe what He says. If any hold that, in spite
   of all this, the Church was not "hid in God," but was the subject of
   Old Testament prophecy, then we have nothing more to say to them; for,
   if they will not believe God, it is not likely they will believe us.

   But, believing God, we ask whether the Church is likely to be the
   subject of prophecy in the Apocalypse, especially when its future is
   clearly foretold in the Epistles which contain the revelation of the
   Mystery. There we learn what is to be the future and end of the Body of
   Christ. The members of that Body are merely waiting to be "received up
   in glory" (1 Tim. iii. 16). They are waiting for their "calling on
   high" (Phil. iii. 14). They are looking for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
   Christ, who shall change their vile bodies that they may be fashioned
   like unto His own glorious body (Phil. iii. 20, 21).

   But all this, we submit, takes place before the Apocalypse opens. There
   we have, not the coming of the Lord to take away His Church, but, the
   revelation of the events which shall take place after the Church has
   been "received up in glory." These events will take place during "the
   day of the Lord," when He shall come not in grace, but in judgement;
   not in mercy, but in wrath. But this brings us to our fourth point.
   What is the meaning of "the Lord's Day," in chap. i. 9?
     __________________________________________________________________

THE LORD'S DAY

   In Rev. i. 9 we are told that John saw and received this revelation on
   "the Lord's Day." Leaving the former part of this verse for the
   present, let us notice the latter expression, "the Lord's Day." [4]

   The majority of people, being accustomed from their infancy to hear the
   first day of the week called the Lord's Day, conclude in their own
   minds that that day is thus called in Rev. i. 9 because that was the
   name of it. But the contrary is the fact: the day is so called by us
   because of this verse.

   In the New testament this day is always called "the first day of the
   week." (See Matt. xxviii. 1; Mark xvi. 2, 9; Luke xxiv. 1; John xx. 1,
   19; Acts xx. 7; I Cor. xvi. 2.). Is it not strange that in this one
   place a different expression is thought to refer to the same day? And
   yet, so sure are the commentators that it means Sunday, that some go as
   far as to say it was "Easter Sunday," and it is for this reason that
   Rev. i. 10-19 is chosen in the New Lectionary of the Church of England
   as the 2nd Lesson for Easter Sunday morning.

   There is no evidence of any kind that "the first day of the week" was
   ever called "the Lord's Day" before the Apocalypse was written. That it
   should be so called afterwards is easily understood, and there can be
   little doubt that the practice arose from the misinterpretation of
   these words in Rev. i. 9. It is incredible that the earliest use of a
   term can have a meaning which only subsequent usage makes intelligible.

   On the contrary, it ceased to be called by its Scripture name ("the
   First day of the week"), not because of any advance of Biblical truth
   or reverence, but because of declension from it. The Greek "Fathers" of
   the Church were converts from Paganism: and it is not yet sufficiently
   recognized how much of Pagan rites and ceremonies and expressions they
   introduced into the Church; and how far Christian ritual was elaborated
   from and based upon Pagan ritual by the Church of Rome. Especially is
   this seen in the case of baptism. [5]

   It was these Fathers who, on their conversion, brought the title
   "Sunday" into the Church from the Pagan terminology which they had been
   accustomed to use in connection with their Sun-worship.

   Justin Martyr (114-165 A.D.) in his second Apology (i.e., his second
   defence of Christianity), says, [6] in chap. lxvii. on "The weekly
   worship of the Christians," - "On the day called SUN-DAY all who live
   in the country gather together to one place... SUN-DAY is the day on
   which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on
   which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the
   world; and Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead.
   For He was crucified on the day before that of SATURN [i.e., Saturn's
   day]; and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the day of the SUN,
   having appeared to his apostles and disciples, He taught them these
   things, which we have submitted to you also for your consideration."

   It is passing strange that if John called the first day of the week
   "the Lord's Day," we find no trace of the use of such a title until a
   hundred years later. And that though we do find a change, it is to
   "Sunday," and not the "the Lord's Day" - a name which has become
   practically universal. [7]

   Some Christians still perpetuate the name of the Lord's Day for Sunday:
   but it is really the survival of a Pagan name, with a new meaning,
   derived from a misunderstanding of Rev. i. 9.

   Objection has been taken to the interpretation of "the Lord's Day"
   here, because we have (in i. 9) the adjective "Lord's" instead of the
   noun (in regimen), "of the Lord," as in the Hebrew. But what else could
   it be called in Hebrew? such objectors do not seem to be aware of the
   fact that there is no adjective for "Lord's" in Hebrew; and therefore
   the only way of expressing "the Lord's Day" is by using the two nouns,
   "the day of the Lord" - which means equally "the Lord's Day" (Jehovah's
   day). It is useless, therefore, to make any objection on this ground;
   for if a Hebrew wanted to say "the Lord's Day," he must say "the day of
   the Lord."

   In the Greek there are two ways of expressing this (as in modern
   languages); either by saying literally, as in Hebrew, "the day of the
   Lord" (using the two nouns); or by using the adjective "Lord's"
   instead. It comes to exactly the same thing as to signification; the
   difference lies only in the emphasis.

   The natural way of qualifying a nouns is by using an adjective, as here
   - (...) (kyriakee) Lord's; and, when this is done, the emphasis takes
   its natural course, and is placed on the noun thus qualified ("day").
   But when the emphasis is required to be placed on the word "Lord;"
   then, instead of the adjective, the noun would be used in the genitive
   case, "of the Lord." In the former case (as in Rev. i. 9), it would be
   "the Lord's DAY." In the latter case it would be "THE LORD'S day." The
   same day is meant in each case, but with a different emphasis.

   By way of illustration and proof, we may call attention to the fact
   that we have the corresponding expressions concerning another "day." In
   Luke xvii. 22 we have "the days of the Son of Man," where the emphasis
   must be on "THE SON OF MAN" (as shown by the context). While in 1 Cor.
   iv. 3 we have "man's DAY," with the emphasis on "day," marking that
   "day" as being actually present, as it now is. This is so clear from
   the context that it is actually translated "judgment," which is exactly
   what it means. The apostle says - "It is a very small thing, that I
   should be judged of you, or of man's DAY." The emphasis is on day,
   because the time in which we now live is the time, or "day," when man
   is judging. Another day is coming, and that is the day when the Lord
   will be present, and He will be the judge. This is the reason why the
   adjective (...) (anthropinee) man's is used in 1 Cor. iv. 3; and this
   is why (...) (kyriakee), Lord's is used in Rev. i. 9. So far from the
   use of the adjective being an argument against our conclusion, it is an
   argument in favour of it. For what is the "DAY of the Lord" or "the
   LORD'S day"? The first occurrence of the expression (which is the key
   to its meaning) is in Isa. ii. 11. [8] It is the day when "the lofty
   looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be
   bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted.

   That is the one great object of all the future events, seen by John in
   vision, and recorded for us in the Apocalypse.

   One other fact has to be stated, and that is the reason why the first
   day of the week came to be called "Sunday." It was called by the Pagan
   "Dominus Sol," the Lord Sun. Hence the Latin name "Dies Dominica," used
   by the early Christian Fathers for the Sunday, and the speedy
   transition of its name from "the Lord Sun" to "the Lord's Day," and
   then "Sunday." Bingham (Ant. xx., sec. 5) mentions the fact that it was
   the custom in the Primitive Church to replace heathen days and
   festivals by those which were Christian. We see one result of this in
   our Yule-tide and Christmas. Bingham (Ant. xx., sec. 2) also mentions
   the fact that the early Christians were charged with being worshippers
   of the sun. Tertullian also admits that Christians were only looked
   upon by some as a sect of sun worshippers: [9] while some account for
   this on other grounds: (e.g. the sects of the Gnostics and Basilideans
   having retained or introduced solar forms of worship). Yet these facts
   are better and more fully accounted for by the adoption of the name
   "the Lord's Day" for the Sunday; while it serves to throw light on the
   transition from the original name of "the first day of the week."

   From all this evidence we feel justified in believing that the
   Apocalypse consists of a series of visions, which set forth the events
   connected with "the Revelation of Jesus Christ," which will take place
   during "the Lord's DAY;" that day being so called because it is viewed
   as being then present; and as it had been called heretofore in
   prophecy, "the day of the Lord."

   The Lord's Day, by the same author and publisher, 1907.

   [7] The French, Spanish, and Italian nations have retained the Roman
   Pagan names. The English is tainted with Scandinavian mythology. The
   1st day they call Dies Dominica, the Lord's Day (i.e., the day of the
   lord, the sun). All the Oriental nations called the sun "lord." The
   Persians called their god Mithra (the sun), i.e., the lord Mithra. The
   Syrians called it Adonis, which is from the Hebrew Adonai, lord. The
   Hebrews called it Baal (which means lord) and Moloch. Porphyry, in a
   prayer to the sun, calls him "Dominus Sol." The Romans kept the Pagan
   name, Dies Dominica (the day of the lord sun), for the first day of the
   week; but called the others by the names of the moon and planets to
   which they were dedicated. Thus we have Dies Lunae (day of the moon),
   Dies Martis (day of Mars), Dies Mercurii (day of Mercury), Dies Jovis
   (day of Jupiter), Dies Veneris (day of Venus), Dies Saturnii (day of
   Saturn).

   [8] It should be noted that the expression (...) (yom Jehovah, the day
   of the Lord) occurs (in the Hebrew Bible) sixteen times, viz., Isa.
   xiii. 6,9. Ezek. xiii. 5, Joel i. 15; ii. 1, 11; iii. 14; iv. 14. Amos
   v. 18 (twice), 20. Obad. 16 (Heb. 1). Zeph. i. 7, 14 (twice), and Mal.
   iv. 5 (Heb. iii. 23).
       In four other places where we have in the English Bible "the day of
   the Lord," the Hebrew has the preposition lamed (...) for or to, before
   the word Jehovah. In Isa. ii. 12, Ezek. xxx. 3, and Zech. xiv. 1 it
   means "a day for Jehovah"; and in Zech. xiv. 7 it means "a day (known)
   to Jehovah."
       In other places where we have in English "the day of the Lord,"
   there is some other word between yom and Jehovah in the Hebrew (such as
   "wrath" or "vengeance;" i.e., the day of the wrath of the Lord)! and
   therefore these cannot be included as examples of this expression, "the
   day of the Lord."
       In the New Testament the expression occurs four times; viz., 1
   Thess. v. 2. 2 Thess. ii. 2 (according to all the critical Greek texts
   and R.V., instead of "the day of Christ.") 2 Pet. iii. 10, and Rev. 1.
   10.
       It is remarkable that all these occurrences are stamped with the
   number four, which marks that day has having special relation to the
   earth. In the New Testament four times. In the Old Testament, with the
   preposition, four times; and simply yom Jehovah 16 times (i.e. the
   square of four). This is merely a note in passing, but it is most
   significant.

THE TITLES OF CHRIST.

   The titles used of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Revelation afford
   further evidence as to the Church of god not being the subject of that
   Book.

   We propose to consider seven of these, all used in the Introduction
   (chap. i).

   The most important of these is that given in connection with his vision
   in chap. i. 13-16. In ver. 13, He is called
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SON OF MAN

   This is a title connected with the Lord Jesus in relation to the earth.
   Its first occurrence in Psa. viii. fixes its peculiar signification.
   That Psalm begins and ends with a reference to the "earth," and, after
   speaking of "the Son of Man," it adds: "Thou madest him to have
   dominion over the works of Thy hands."

   It will be found, therefore, that wherever this title occurs, it always
   refers to the Lord Jesus in connection with His dominion in the earth.
   [10] And, when used of His second coming, it refers to the judgment
   which He is then and there to exercise.

   It is most remarkable, and so remarkable as to make it practically
   conclusive, that this title, while it occurs eighty-four times in the
   New Testament, is never once used in the Pauline epistles addressed to
   Churches; thus proving that this title has nothing whatever to do with
   the Church. But while it has no connection with the Church, in the
   Epistles, it occurs no less than eighty times in the four Gospels and
   Acts, because there we have Christ on the earth, and the presentation
   of the King and the Kingdom.

   But, when again he reveals Himself by this title, it is in the Book of
   Revelation (i. 13 and xiv. 14). [11]

   Thus we are pointed to the fact, and told (if we have ears to hear),
   that the Apocalypse relates to the coming of "the Son of Man" to
   exercise judgment in and assume dominion over the earth.

   It is remarkable that the first use of the title in the New Testament
   is in Matt. viii. 20, where it is said: "The Son of Man hath no where
   to lay His head": and the last is in Rev. xiv. 14, where the Son of Man
   is seen "having on His head a golden crown." Both are connected with
   his "head," and with the earth; while in the latter there is associated
   both judgment and dominion.

   The significance of this title is further proved by its contrast with
   the title "Son of God" in John v. 25-27: "Verily, I say unto you, the
   hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of THE
   SON OF GOD, and they that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life
   in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and
   hath given Him authority to execute judgment also; because He is THE
   SON OF MAN."

   It is thus clear that the use of this title twice in Revelation (i. 13
   and xiv. 14), and not once in the Church Epistles, is a further proof
   that the Church is not the subject of the Apocalypse.

   The Church has no more to do with Christ under the title of "The Son of
   Man" than the Syro-Phoenician woman had anything to do with Him as "the
   Son of David."

   We ought to add that this fact is a key to all the passages where this
   title is used: and shows that Matt. xiv. and xxv. have nothing whatever
   to do with the Church of God, because of the use of this title in xxiv.
   30, and xxv. 31. Both refer to His coming in clouds to the earth in
   judgment, after the Church has been taken up, and after the Great
   Tribulation.

  THE ALMIGHTY

   This title is used nine times [12] in the Apocalypse, and only once
   elsewhere in the rest of the New Testament (2 Cor. vi. 18). [13]

   It is (...) (pantokrator) and means having dominion over all, and is
   used in the Old Testament as the Septuagint translation of "Lord of
   Hosts" (Heb., Jehovah, Sabaioth; see 2 Sam. v. 10; vii. 25, 27).

   In Revelation the title is used in i. 8; iv 8; xi. 17; xv. 3; xvi. 7,
   14; xix. 6, 15, 22.

   "The Lord of Hosts" means Jehovah of the hosts in heaven above, and on
   the earth beneath; and especially of the hosts of Israel. Its first
   occurrence is (as usual) most significant (see 1 Sam. i. 3, 11; and iv.
   4), when Israel was reduced to a low estate - oppressed by the
   Philistines. All had failed. The Judges had failed. The priests
   (witness Eli) had failed: there was "no king in Israel:" and God's
   sanctuary was defiled.

   But the revelation of this title at this juncture, and here used for
   the first time, told of the blessed fact that there was going to be a
   king; and a judge too; as well as a Priest upon His throne; that the
   sanctuary was going to be cleansed (Rev. xi.), and the oppressors of
   Israel destroyed. Israel is, conversely, called "The Lord's Host" (see
   Exod. xii. 42), when, at the moment of the formation of the nation at
   the end of the 430 years of sojourning and servitude, and the birth of
   the new nation at the Exodus, we read these most significant words:
   "and it came to pass at the end of the 430 years, even the self-same
   day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out of the
   land of Egypt."

   And further, we may note that, in Joshua v. 14, 15, we have the real
   connection between "the Lord of Hosts" and "The Hosts of the Lord."
   Jehovah-Jesus announces His coming as "the Captain of the Lord's Host,"
   to lead them on, to fight their battles, to judge the nations, and give
   them rest, and settle them in their own land.

   Now, we ask, Is it not most significant that this is the title used
   here in the Apocalypse, nine times? Does not the fact speak to us and
   say that, when that book opens Israel is in low estate? That Priests
   and people alike have failed, and there is "no king." Does it not say
   that "the Captain of the Lord's host" is coming down as their judge and
   vindicator, to deliver them from their oppressors, to fight for them,
   and give them rest, and to bring them into their own land?

   Surely the association of this title, Pantokrator, with the Lord of
   Hosts in the Old Testament, and with Israel; its frequent use in
   Revelation, and its practical absence in the Church Epistles, shuts us
   up to the fact that we have in this book, not the Church, but that
   which concerns the Jew and the Gentile.

   It is in this book we have that which the first occurrence of the title
   in the Book of Psalms relates to:

   "Who is this King of glory (i.e. this glorious King)? The Lord of Hosts
   - He is the King of Glory."

   And it is the object of the Apocalypse to show how this comes about,
   and how He becomes the King of kings and Lord of lords (xix. 16). And
   how all "the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord
   and of His Christ" (xi. 15).

   Then, too, will Israel fulfil the forty-sixth Psalm, and say:

   "The Lord of Hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge."

  LORD GOD

   In i. 8 the title "god" must be added to the word "Lord," according to
   all the Critical Greek Texts [14] and the R.V.

   In chap. xxii. 6 we have the same title. Thus at the end of the book
   and at the beginning we have this peculiar title, which seems to
   enclose all that the book contains, and stamp it all with that which
   the title signifies. What is signifies is clear from the place where we
   first find it, vix., in the second of the twelve divisions of Genesis
   (chap. ii. 4 - iv. 26). This division is called "the generations of the
   heavens and of the earth."

   In the Apocalypse we have the final results of all that pertains to the
   heavens and the earth.

   The title "Lord God" is the title used in this division, which treats
   of the settlement of man in Paradise, or garden of the Lord. In the New
   Testament it first appears in the Apocalypse; where it has reference to
   the undoing of the effects of the curse (describe in that section of
   Genesis), and to the making of the earth again into the Paradise [15]
   of God - the garden of the Lord.

   The title implies all this: viz., that God is about to do all that
   Jehovah has revealed. For Elohim is the God of creation and the
   commencement of life, while Jehovah is the God of revelation and the
   development and sustainer of life with regard to His covenant People.
   Elohim (God) expresses the power which accomplishes; Jehovah (Lord) the
   grace which provides.

   Hence in Gen. ii. 4 - iv. 26, and in Rev. i. 8, and xxii. 5 we meet
   with this title; which links the two books together in a most
   remarkable manner, and gives the pledge that Paradise lost will become
   Paradise regained; and that the curse which drove man out shall no
   longer keep him out, but shall be "no more" for ever.

   This use of the title "Lord God" thus assures us that He who made the
   promise of Gen. iii. 15, that the Serpent's head should one day be
   crushed, will, in His own day (the Lord's day), finally crush the
   Serpent's head.

   The fact that this title is never used in connection with the Church of
   God, affords us one more great and important proof of our proposition
   that [the] Church is not the subject of the Apocalypse, but that it has
   to do with the Jew and the Gentile.

   [15] The word Paradise occurs in the New Testament three times. Luke
   xxiii. 43, where the Lord spoke of it in promise and prophecy; in 2
   Cor. xii. 9, whither Paul was caught away; and in Rev. ii. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIRST AND THE LAST

   This title is used in Rev. i. 11. It is used again in 1. 17, ii. 8, and
   xxii. 13, but is never found in connection with "the Church of God." On
   the other hand, it is a title closely associated with "the Jew and the
   Gentile," as the following Scriptures will testify.

   Is. xli. 4, 5: "Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations
   from the beginning? I, Jehovah, THE FIRST AND LAST; I am He. The isles
   saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid."

   Is. xliv. 6: "Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his
   Redeemer, the Lord of hosts; I AM THE FIRST, AND I AM THE LAST; and
   beside me there is no God."

   Is. xlviii. 12: "Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel, my called; I am
   he; I AM THE FIRST, I ALSO AM THE LAST. Mine hand hath laid the
   foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens:
   when I call unto them, they stand up together."

   Is it not clear, almost to certainty, that when the Lord Jesus
   specially reveals Himself by this title, never using it again till He
   claims it in the book of Revelation four [16] times, He means to teach
   us that He is come to act on behalf of Israel and in connection with
   that People with which this title is thus peculiarly associated?

   The connection of Isaiah with Revelation in the use of this title is
   eloquent to all who have "ears to hear."

  THE PRINCE OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH

   This is a title used only in this book (i. 5). Many kings are mentioned
   and referred to in the book: but the Lord Jesus comes as their
   "Prince;" "King of kings and Lord of lords."

   The word is (...) (archon), and occurs in the New Testament 37 times.
   It is used of earthly rulers, and spirit rulers of this age; also of
   Christ (only of Christ) in relation to the earth; but never in relation
   to or in connection with the Church.

   He it is of whom His God and Father has declared, "I will make Him my
   first-born, higher than the kings of the earth" (Ps. lxxxix. 27).

   It is in connection with the earth that He comes, in Revelation, and
   hence this title is used. Another testimony to the truth of our
   proposition.
     __________________________________________________________________

  WHO IS TO COME

   This also is a definite title of Christ; (...) (ho erchomenos), THE
   COMING ONE.

   It is not, who is "about to come," [17] as though it were announcing a
   fact or an act, as being near at hand: but, it describes a person who
   has this for His special title, by which He came to be known. He has
   borne that title ever since the great prophecy and promise of Gen. iii.
   15. From that time the coming "seed of the woman" has always been the
   hope of God's People, and hence He is "The Coming One."

   True, He was rejected; therefore that coming is now in abeyance. The
   book of Revelation is a prophecy giving further details concerning that
   same coming. The Church of God waits for the Saviour, not as the coming
   one to the earth. It is as going ones we wait for Him, looking to be
   caught up to meet Him in the air.

   "The Coming One" is His special title, which connects Him with the Old
   Testament prophecies.

   The title is never once used in any of the Church epistles. We have it
   variously rendered: -

   "That cometh," Luke xix. 38. John xii. 13. "He that cometh," Matt. iii.
   11; xxi. 9; xxiii. 39. John i. 15; iii. 31 (twice). "Who coming," John
   i. 27. "He that shall come," Heb. x. 37. "Which (or that) should come,"
   John vi. 14; xi. 27. "He that (or which) should come," Matt. xi. 3.
   Luke vii. 19,20. Acts xix. 4. "Which is (or art) to come," Rev. i. 4,8;
   iv. 8. [18]

   Sixteen times we have the title in the Gospels and Acts and Heb. x. 37;
   and then, not again until Revelation; when it is used three times of
   Him who was about to fulfil the hope of His People.

   This again stamps this prophecy as having to do with Christ as God, who
   "is" (essential being), and "was" (in eternity past), and is "the
   coming one" (time future).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] This would be (...) (ho mellon erchesthai)

   [18] "Which art to come," in Rev. xi. 17, was inserted by a later
   scribe, thinking to make it harmonize with i. 4,8; and iv. 8. It must
   be omitted according to all the Critical Greek Texts (G[r]. L. T. Tr.
   A. [WH.]) and the R.V. It clearly is out of place here, because the
   twenty-four elders say, "We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty,
   which art, and wast, because thou hast taken to thee thy great power,
   and reignedst" (not hast reigned). The coming had already taken place
   in Rev. xi. 17: and therefore the title of "the Coming One" is omitted
   in this passage.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE LIVING ONE

   "I am He that liveth, and was dead" (i. 18). (...) (ho zon), THE LIVING
   ONE. Like the previous title, it is used as a special designation of
   the One whose unveiling is about to be shewn to John.

   Its use is peculiar to Daniel and Revelation. The two books thus linked
   together by it are linked as to their character and subject matter in a
   very special manner.

   It is used twice in Daniel:- Dan. iv. 34 (31 [19] ) and xii. 7; and six
   time in Revelation:- Rev. i. 18; iv. 9,10; v. 14; x. 6; and xv. 7. [20]

   In Dan. iv. 34 (the first occurrence), we read of Nebuchadnezzer, "I
   praised and honoured HIM THAT LIVETH for ever; whose dominion is an
   everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation;
   and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he
   doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the
   inhabitants of the earth."

   That exactly expresses what He who reveals Himself by the title, "He
   that liveth," in Rev. i. 18, has there come to do.

   He is coming with the armies of heaven (Rev. xix. 14) to take the
   kingdom and the dominion, and to do his will among the inhabitants of
   the earth (not the church or the churches).

   Dan. xii. 7 and Rev. x. 6 are so similar that we put them side by side.
   Both refer to and contrast Christ's relation to eternity and to time:

   "He (the angel) held up his right hand and his left to heaven, and
   sware by him that liveth for ever that is shall be for a time, times,
   and a half, and ... all these things shall be finished" (Dan. xii. 7).

   "And the angel... lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that
   liveth for ever and ever... that there should be time (R.V. marg.,
   delay) no longer" (Rev. x. 5,6).

   Who can doubt that Daniel and Revelation are identical as to their
   scope; and that they relate, not to this present church period at all,
   but to the time when "he that liveth," or the Living One, shall come to
   exercise dominion in the earth, and this in connection, not with the
   grace of God, but with "the wrath of God" (Rev. xv. 7)? The double
   testimony of two witnesses, in Daniel and Revelation, bespeak the fact
   that this title relates entirely to the earth, and to man. [21]

   The church is heavenly in its calling, its standing, its hope, and its
   destiny. But here, everything relates to the execution of judgment on
   the earth, and upon man.

   There is a related title which is also very significant, "the living
   God." This is used in both Testaments, and indiscriminately, because it
   has no special reference either to Israel or to the church; but because
   of a latent reference it always has, to idols, and to judgment on
   idolaters. This is often expressed in the context; but where it is not
   actually expressed in words, the thought of idols and idolatry and
   idolaters has to be supplied mentally.

   The title ("the living God") occurs 13 times in the Old Testament
   (Hebrew), and twice in the Chaldee (Dan. vi. 20,26), fifteen times in
   all. It begins in connection with apostasy (13), but ends in grace and
   blessing (15=3X5).

   In the New Testament it occurs sixteen times (4X4), the square of four,
   four being the number specially associated with the earth.

   The whole matter is so important and full of interest, that we venture
   to give all the references.

   The first, Deut. v. 26 (23) gives the key (as usual) to the whole. It
   is in connection with the giving of the Ten Commandments (with special
   reference to the second, iv. 19), when they "heard the voice of the
   living God (Elohim) speaking out of the midst of the fire."

   We say that the title here used is in connection with idolatry; and
   especially in its most ancient and universal form, sun-worship.

   A few verses before (Deut. iv. 19), we read, "Lest thou lift up thine
   eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the
   stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship
   them, and to serve them," etc.

   The whole heathen world worshipped the sun and the host of heaven;
   because they "associated with them certain human characters who had
   really performed the actions which were thence ascribed to the
   celestial bodies. [22] The sun had various attributes; and one was "the
   living one." [23] The sun has a conspicuous place in freemasonry; and
   sun-worship has its ramifications throughout the whole world. We cannot
   impede our argument by giving further details here. We have put them
   together in an Appendix, where our readers may see the evidence for
   themselves.

   Our point is this; that the first use of the title "the living God" has
   to do with the voice out of the midst of the fire; and the last use of
   it (in Rev. vii. 2) is where God's servants are sealed with "the seal
   of the living God," so as to be kept from the then coming most awful
   phase of idolatry the world has ever seen, even the worship of the
   Beast; and to be preserved from and through the consequent judgments
   which shall come on those worshippers.

   In Deut. xxii. 40,41, we have (not the title, but) words which connect
   the thought contained in it with that time of judgment.

   Deut. xxxii. contains that "Song of Moses," of which Rev. xv. 3 speaks,
   and the time referred to is Apocalyptic time. "For I lift up my hand to
   heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering sword, and
   mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine
   enemies, and will reward them that hate me" (Deut. xxxii. 40,41).

   Ps. xviii. 46-48 (47-49). "The Lord liveth...It is God that avengeth
   me, and subdueth the people under me. He delivereth me from mine
   enemies:" etc.

   The title also has to do with Israel's restoration and deliverance. See
   Jer. xvi. 14,15; xxiii. 7,8.

   The judgment on those who use this title of idols is described in Amos
   viii. 14.

   If our readers will compare all the occurrences which we now give of
   this title, "the living God," they will see how (as a whole) they refer
   to Israel, to Gentiles, to the earth, to idolaters, and to idols.

   Deut. v. 26 (23). Josh. iii. 10. I Sam. xvii. 26,36, where David uses
   it against the defiance of Goliath. 2 Kings xix. 4,16. Isa. xxxvii.
   4,17, where it is used against the reproach of Sennacherib. Ps. xlii. 2
   (3); lxxxiv. 2 (3), where it is used with a latent reference to the
   false gods which others worship and seek. So Jer. x. 10; xxiii. 36, and
   Hos. i. 10 (ii. 1).

   In the New Testament the usage is the same. Matt. xvi. 16; xxvi. 63.
   John vi. 69. Acts xiv. 15. Rom. ix. 26. 2 Cor. iii. 3; vi. 16. 1 Thess.
   i. 9 (idols). 1 Tim. iii. 15; iv. 10; vi. 17. Heb. iii. 12; ix. 14; x.
   31; xii. 22; and Rev. vii. 2. Sixteen in all (4 in the Gospels and
   Acts, 4 in the Church Epistles, 3 in the Pastoral Epistles, 4 in
   Hebrews, and once in Revelation).

   Enough has been said on this particular title, and upon the seven as a
   whole, to show that they all link on the book of Revelation to the Old
   Testament and the Gospels, and not to the Church; and that their
   cumulative testimony is that Christ is revealed in this book, not in
   the character in which He is presented to the Church of God, but in
   that character in which He is revealed in the Old Testament in relation
   to Israel and the Earth, which is again taken up in the Apocalypse.

   There are other titles of Christ in this book which all add their own
   testimony; but these we can leave for the present, till we come to them
   in their own place. Enough has been said to show that these titles
   assumed by the Lord Jesus in the first chapter of this book shut it
   entirely off, by way of interpretation, from the Church, which is His
   Body.

THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK.

   "SERVANTS"

   This expression tells us who the person are who are specially concerned
   in this book; and to whom the Revelation of Jesus Christ is shown. At
   the very outset we are thus warned that we are no longer on, but quite
   off, the ground of the Pauline Epistles, which are addressed to "sons,"
   and not to "servants."

   The word is (...), doulos, and means a bond servant.

   Now, without denying that the members of the Body of Christ are in a
   certain sense the servants of Christ, yet it is also perfectly clear
   that this is not their title as to their standing in Christ before God.
   It is distinctly declared to each of them, "Thou art no more a servant,
   but a son" (Gal. iv. 7). This is the one great point which is insisted
   on with reference to their new position in Christ.

   Throughout the Old Testament, in passages too numerous to be counted,
   God's People Israel are constantly spoken of as His servants. This fact
   is too well known to need anything more than its bare statement.

   Its significance will be at once seen when we come to the New Testament
   Scriptures. There we find the same use of the word whenever Israel is
   in question. It occurs 124 times; but as in 39 of these it refers to
   domestic servants, or those who serve man, we have to deal only with
   the 85 occurrences where it is used with reference to God. Of these 85,
   no less than 59 are in the Gospels and Acts. Only six in the Church
   Epistles (Rom. i. 1; 1 Cor. vii. 22; Gal. i. 10; Eph. vi. 6; Phil. i.
   1; Col. iv. 12), and six in the general and other Epistles (2 Tim. ii.
   24; Tit. i. 1; Jas. i. 1; 1 Pet. ii. 16; 2 Pet. i. 1; Jude 1).

   But while this is the case with the Epistles, the word "servants"
   occurs no less than fourteen times in the book of Revelation, and this,
   not in the exceptional manner, as in the Epistles, but as the one
   specific and proper title for those who are the subjects of the book.

   In the Epistles the use is peculiar, as an examination of the passages
   will show. Out of the whole twelve, six are in the first verse of the
   Epistle, [24] describing the special character of the writer. For while
   all sons serve, and are in a sense, therefore, servants, yet
   "servants," as such, are not necessarily sons.  In other words a "son"
   may be called a servant, but a "servant" can never be called a son.

   Hence, the writers of the Epistles, being all engaged in special
   service, might well be called servants. And the Apocalypse, being
   written concerning Israel, the Israelites are, as appropriately, always
   spoken of as "servants."

   This evidence may not seem conclusive in itself; but, taken with the
   other reasons given, it adds its cumulative testimony to our position
   that the book of Revelation has not the Church of God for its subject.

   As the members of the Body of Christ, we are "in Christ." We have
   received a sonship-spirit, whereby we cry, Abba - i.e., my Father,
   "...and if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ" (Rom. viii. 15-17).

   "As many as are led by Divine-spirit (i.e., the new nature) are sons of
   God; for we have not received a bond-service spirit" (v. 14,15). This
   is enlarged upon in Gal. iv. 1-7, where the fact is still more clearly
   enforced and taught.

   May we not ask why, if the Apocalypse be all about the Church of God,
   the people are never spoken of by this their new designation of "sons,"
   but always by the title used of those in the Old Testament who were
   under the Law? Is it not passing strange that this should be so? And is
   it not the duty of those interpreters who see the Church as the subject
   of the book, to explain to us this striking peculiarity?

   Even in the Gospels, in speaking to the Twelve, the Lord Jesus
   specially calls their and our attention to such a change in the
   relationship, which had then taken place. Not so great a change as that
   revealed and contained in the Mystery. He had been showing them
   somewhat of the future, and He says (John xv. 15), "Henceforth I call
   you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but
   I have called you friends." In the Apocalypse, He is about to show them
   things which must come to pass hereafter; and He does not even call
   them "friends," still less does He speak of them as "sons," but He goes
   back and takes up still more distant ground, and calls them, without
   exception, "servants."

   A careful study of the Old Testament with reference to this word
   "servants" will help to strengthen our position. In Lev. xxv. 42,
   Jehovah declares of them, "they are my servants." Deut. is full of
   references to this great fact: and, when we pass to the Apocalypse, and
   read it as the continuation of God's dealings with Israel, then all is
   clear; and we have no problem to solve, as to why all is turned from
   light to darkness, and the "sons of God" are suddenly spoken of as
   "servants." Neither have we any difficulty to explain as to why those
   who are declared to be no more "servants," but "sons," are continually
   called servants, and not sons.

   Even John himself, in writing by the same Spirit for the Church of God
   (1 John iii. 2), when speaking of them, says, "Beloved, now are we the
   sons of God," and he calls them this in view of their seeing Him as He
   is, and their becoming like Him. But when he is writing for those who
   will be on the earth during the times of the Great Tribulation, he is
   Divinely inspired to speak of them, not as "the sons of God," but as
   the "servants of God."

   We repeat once again, in order to make this point quite clear, that
   while "sons" may perform some special service, and therefore may, on
   that account, be called "servants:" "servants," on the contrary,
   whatever may be the service rendered, can never occupy the position, or
   have the title, of "sons."

THE TITLE OF THE BOOK.

   Our next evidence is the title given to the book by the Holy Spirit who
   inspired it.

   It is not "the Revelation of St. John the Divine," which is man's title
   for it. Indeed, among the later MSS., we find fifteen or sixteen
   various titles; but the Divine title given in the text, is "The
   Revelation of Jesus Christ."

   The word (...) apocalupsis.  Hence the title of "Apocalypse" so
   frequently given to the book.

   It is from the verb (...) apocalupto to unveil, from (...) apo away
   from, and (...) ~kalumma a veil.  Hence Apocalypsis means a taking away
   of a veil (as when a statue is said to be unveiled), and thus bringing
   into view that which had been before hidden as by a veil. Unveiling is
   the equivalent English word.

   It is used, of course, in two senses: viz., of a bringing to knowledge
   by the removing of the veil of ignorance; or of the visible appearance
   of one who had previously been unseen, as though hidden by a veil.

   Our point is that, whenever this word is used of a visible person or
   thing, it always denotes the visible manifestation of that person; and
   it is the same in the case of all material or visible things.

   This is not a matter of opinion, but it is a matter of fact, on which
   our readers can easily satisfy themselves by examining the passages.

   The word occurs eighteen times; and in the following ten places is used
   of a person.

   Luke ii. 32 - "A light to lighten the Gentiles," literally "a light for
   a revelation to the Gentiles." What was this light? It was a person,
   even the Saviour in Simeon's arms, of whom he could say, "Mine eyes
   have seen Thy salvation."

   Rom. ii. 5 - "The day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment
   of God." Here it refers to the visible judgment of God, which will be
   manifested to all in "the day of wrath."

   Rom. viii. 19 - "The manifestation of the sons of God:" i.e., the
   visible revelation of the sons of God, when they shall appear and be
   manifested in glory with Christ (Col. iii. 4).

   1 Cor. i. 7 - "Waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." Here,
   without doubt, it refers to the personal appearing of Christ. This
   passage occurs in one of the earlier epistles of St. Paul, written
   during the Dispensation of the Acts, while the offer of the Kingdom and
   the King was still open to Israel (iii. 19-21), before the sentence of
   judicial blindness was passed upon Israel (Acts xxviii. 25,26). The
   words Parousia (1 Thess., &c) and Apocalypse were suitable for that
   Dispensation; and, of course, necessitated the personal presence of the
   Lord Jesus.

   2 Cor. xii. 1 - "I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
   Here the word is joined to visions as though it meant visible
   manifestations of the Lord. Verse 7 may mean either a revelation of
   truths, or visible scenes of glory, or both.

   Gal. i. 12 - "I neither received it (i.e., the Gospel which he
   announced) from man, neither was I taught it [by man], but by a
   revelation (i.e., a vision or visible appearance) of Jesus Christ."
   There is no reason whatever why the word should not have both meanings.
   Why should not the Lord have appeared to him, and made known to him
   that message which was given to him? It must have been made known to
   him in some way; and he distinctly says it was by Jesus Christ (not by
   the Holy Spirit). Therefore it must have been in one of those many
   "visions" which he says he saw at different times; and probably during
   those three preparatory years which he spent in Arabia (Gal. i. 17,18).

   In verse 16 it is the verb that is used and not the noun, and therefore
   it does not come within our inquiry.

   2 Thess. i. 7 - "When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
   His mighty angels." Here, though the English uses the verb, the Greek
   has the noun, and reads, "And to you who are troubled, rest with us at
   the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels."
   There can be no doubt about this passage. (See below, the chapter on
   "The scope of the book, gathered from its place in the Canon.")

   1 Pet. i. 7 - "Might be found unto praise and honour and glory at (the)
   revelation of Jesus Christ." The context shows that the meaning here is
   the same as in 2 Thess. i. 10, and refers to His visible manifestation
   with His People in the air at His Revelation.

   But, if Peter's words are taken as referring to the remnant, then the
   visible manifestation is to them.

   So in verse 13, we have the same expression, "at (the) revelation of
   Jesus Christ."

   Also in iv. 13 where we read of the time "when His glory shall be
   revealed;" i.e., visibly manifested.

   Now from all these ten passages, is it not clear that the word
   Apocalupsis, when it refers to what can be seen (such as a thing or a
   person), always means that visible manifestation of that person or
   thing?

   If so, that is what we have in this book. We have an account of the
   various events which are to take place in heaven and on earth,
   connected with His visible unveiling. It is His Apocalupsis which God
   gave Him the right or authority to show, make known, or represent to
   his bondservants what must shortly come to pass.

   It is this thrusting of the sense of making known a truth into the word
   which, when used of a person, means the appearance of that person, that
   has led people commonly to speak of this book in the plural, "the
   RevelationS."

   We have therefore, in the Title of this book, further evidence that the
   subject of this whole book is the visible appearing of Jesus Christ in
   power, and glory; and for judgment in the earth. It is not a series of
   revelations about Jesus Christ; but the book which gives us the
   particulars about the events which are connected with His revelation or
   appearing. And it is made known, it says, specially, to his "servants,"
   as we saw in our previous point.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE BOOK.

   The descriptive titles given to this book mark it off as being special
   in its nature, distinct from the other books of the New Testament; and
   in character and keeping with the prophetic books of the Old Testament.
   It is called
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE WORD OF GOD

   This is not used as a general term, of the Scriptures or of the Bible,
   as such: [25] but in a special sense, not uncommon in the Old
   Testament, of the "word which comes from God," or which He speaks.
   Hence, a prophetic message, e.g.,

   1 Sam. ix. 27. Samuel said to Saul: "Stand thou still awhile, that I
   may show thee the word of God."

   1 Kings xii. 22. "The word of God came unto Shemaiah, the man of God
   (i.e., the prophet), saying." (Compare 2 Chron. xi. 2; xii. 15.)

   1 Chron. xvii. 3. "The word of God came to Nathan." (So 2 Sam. vii. 4.)

   It is difficult to distinguish between the written Word and the Living
   Word. Both make known and reveal God.

   In Gen. xv. 1, we read "The Word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
   vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield," etc. Here, it is
   evidently the Living Word, though it may include both.

   When we come to the Apocalypse, we are at once prepared for both --
   Vision of the Living Word, and also the prophetic word of the Living
   God; both making known to the servants of God the visions and words of
   "this prophecy" (ver. 3).

   Five times we have this expression in this book. [26] Not in the common
   sense, as in the Gospels and Epistles, but in this special sense of a
   prophetic message.

   In i. 9 John tells us he "was in the Isle that is called Patmos, for
   the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ." Leaving the
   latter expression for a moment, we may remark that the popular
   interpretation of the word "for" is based on a tradition which
   doubtless sprang from a misunderstanding of these words. There is no
   idea of banishment in them. It was no accident which lead to the giving
   of this prophecy. John went to Patmos "for" the purpose of receiving it
   (as Paul went into Arabia, Gal. i. 17). "On account of" is the meaning
   of the word here used, for "for." [27] If his preaching of "the Word of
   God" was the cause of this being in Patmos, another expression would
   have been used. See Exposition below, on i. 9.

   Verse 2 tells us that "the word of God" consisted of "the things that
   he saw." How could John be banished to Patmos because of, or by reason
   of, the things which he saw in Patmos!

   No, the truth here recorded is that John was there on account of (i.e.,
   to receive) "the word of God," i.e., the prophetic message, even "the
   words of this prophecy."

   There is a second descriptive title which stamps this book. It is
   called
     __________________________________________________________________

   [25] Though, of course, as the Bible is made up of the words of God, we
   may conveniently and very truly use "the Word of God" of the Scriptures
   as a whole. See Jer. xv. 16.

   [26] Chaps. i. 2; i. 9; vi. 9; xix. 13; xx. 4.

   [27] As in Heb. ii. 9, "For the suffering of death crowned with glory
   and honour;" and verse 10 - "For whom are all things and by whom are
   all things." So Rom. iv. 25, "on account of."
     __________________________________________________________________

  THIS PROPHECY

   Seven times we have the word prophecy in this book, [28] and prophecy
   is its one great subject.

   It is "prophecy" for us, therefore, and not past history. It is
   prophecy concerning the events which shall take place "hereafter"
   during the day of the Lord, i.e., during the day when the Lord will be
   the Judge, in contradistinction to the present day, i.e., "man's day"
   (1 Cor. iv. 3) during which man is judging (to the painful experience
   of most of us). See Exposition on i. 10.

   Even "Historicists" take some part of this book as prophecy.

   Most "Futurists" take from iv. 1 as prophecy.

   But we fall back on the first blessing in verse 3: "Blessed is he that
   readeth and they that hear the words of THIS PROPHECY."

   That reading commences at once; that hearing commences with the
   reading. Neither is to be postponed till some future time, or to some
   particular part of the book: nor are we to be left in ignorance as to
   where our reading and our blessing commences. We believe that "this
   prophecy" means "this prophecy," and that we begin at once to read it
   and to get the blessing. It cannot be that we are to read on and wait
   till we come to some particular verse where the blessing commences. Our
   attention to what is written is not to be postponed. All the words are
   "the words of this prophecy." John was to bear witness of "all things
   that he saw" (ver. 2); and the command is "what thou seest write in A
   BOOK." What we have therefore is in "a book;" and that book contains
   all that John saw and heard; and it is called "this prophecy." The
   whole book, therefore, is prophecy for us. It is "those things which
   are written in it" which we are to keep: and it is as a whole Book that
   we propose to deal with it. We feel it safer to be guided by what God
   Himself calls it than by what man tells us as to what part is prophecy
   and what is not. If they who tell us this were agreed among themselves
   it would be something; but when they differ, we cannot gain much by
   listening to them.

   The evidence afforded by this title is, that, as the whole book is
   prophecy, the Church of God is not the subject of it: for, as we have
   seen, the Church is not the subject of prophecy, but of "revelation."
   The future of the Church is given and written for our reading and
   blessing in the Pauline Epistles; especially in 1 Thess. iv., where the
   Apostle Paul speaks "by the word of the Lord," which means, here as
   well as elsewhere, a prophetic announcement. Further, we may add that,
   when John is told that he is to prophesy again (x. 11), it is not about
   the Church, but about "peoples and nations and tongues and kings."

   But there is another title given to this book. It is
     __________________________________________________________________

   [28] chaps. i. 3; xi. 6; xix. 10; xxii. 7,10,18,19.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST

   Now, this may mean the testimony concerning Him (the Gen. of the object
   or relation); or, the testimony which comes from Him (the Gen. of the
   subject or origin), i.e., which he bore.

   If we take it as the former, it then agrees with the whole prophetic
   word, which is concerning Him as "the coming One."

   If we take it in the latter meaning, then it refers to the nature of
   the testimony which the Lord Jesus bore when on earth; and does not go
   outside it. That testimony related to the kingdom and not to the
   Church.

   The word for "testimony" is worthy of note. It is (...), marturia
   (fem.), and not (...), marturion (neuter). Now, when there are two
   nouns from the same root, one feminine and the other neuter, there is
   an unmistakable difference, which has to be carefully noted and
   observed: i.e., if we believe that we are dealing with "the words which
   the Holy Ghost teacheth," as we most certainly do.

   The difference here is clear and decided, and a few illustrations will
   be convincing.

   The neuter noun, ending in (...)(-ion), denotes something definite and
   substantial, while the feminine noun, ending in (...)(ia), denotes the
   matter referred to or contained in or relating to the neuter noun.

   For example: Emporia is merchandise; while Emporion is the place or
   building where the merchandise (emporia) is stored (the Emporium).

   Apostasia are the matters concerning which there is defection, falling
   away, forsaking or revolt (Acts xxi. 21, 2 Thess. ii. 3); while
   Apostasion is the act of falling away, or the document, etc., which
   contains it. Hence it is the technical term for a bill of divorcement
   (Matt. v. 31; xix. 7; Mark x. 4).

   Georgia is tillage; georgion is the field where the tillage is carried
   on. (1 Cor. iii. 9 only).

   Gymnasia denotes the exercises (1 Tim. iv. 8); gymnasium, the place or
   building where the exercises are done.

   Dokimee is the examination or proof (Rom. v. 4; 2 Cor. ii. 9; viii. 2,
   ix. 13, xiii. 3; Phil. ii. 22); while dokimion is the trial, at which
   the examination is made and the proofs given (Jas. i. 3; 1 Pet. i. 7
   only).

   Mneia is remembrance or mention (Rom. i. 9; Eph. i. 16; Phil. i. 3; 1
   Thess. i. 2, iii. 6; 2 Tim. i. 3; Philem. 4); mneion is the tombstone
   or sepulchre where the mention or remembrance is made.

   Soteria is a saving or delivering (and is the general word for
   salvation in N.T.); while soterion is the act of saving, and almost the
   person who delivers. See Luke ii. 30 (where it is "seen") and iii. 6.
   Acts xxviii. 28; Eph. v. 17. [29]

   Now, in the Apocalypse, we have maturion (the neuter), testimony, only
   once (Rev. xv. 5), where it is used of a thing, "the tabernacle of the
   testimony," i.e., the tent and tables of stone which were placed
   therein. In every other place (nine times) we have marturia, i.e., the
   testimony given or witness borne (i. 2,9; vi. 9; xi. 7; xii. 11,17;
   xix. 10, twice; xx. 4). In all these cases therefore, it is testimony
   or witness borne, as a reference to them will show.

   It seems, then, quite clear that, where we read in this prophecy of
   "the testimony of Jesus" (i. 2,9; xii. 17; xix. 10, twice [30] ), it
   means the testimony which the Lord Jesus bore or gave on earth as
   "Jesus" in the days of His humiliation (not as the Christ as raised
   from the dead).

   The testimony was, as we have already said, concerning His kingdom and
   concerning Israel (see Rom. xv. 8); and it is the same testimony which
   the same Jesus gives in the book of this prophecy.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] In some cases these references support these facts; in other they
   must be re-interpreted by them.
      It will be noted that the accentuation of these words in -ion
   intimates that they are all properly adjectives: hence the actual noun
   to be supplied in each case will vary with the nature of the noun from
   which the adjective is formed. The general distinction, however, holds
   good: that the words in -ia represent a process, or habit, and that,
   too, under its feminine, not masculine, aspect; while the neuters
   represent some special act, or instance of this habit or process, or
   some material or instrument by which, or place in which, the habit is
   carried out, or the process carried on.

   [30] In xx. 4 it is doubtless the testimony concerning Jesus for which
   those who gave it were beheaded. (The Gen. of relation.)

CERTAIN EXPRESSIONS IN CHAPS. i. - iii.

   There are certain expressions used throughout the Apocalypse which are
   wholly unlike any expressions used in connection with the Church of God
   or in the Church Epistles.

   Some of these are sufficient in themselves to show that the Church is
   not the subject of the Apocalypse, and have been already noticed. But
   there are others of importance which require more lengthened treatment;
   so we group them together under this heading, referring our reader to
   the Exposition which follows, where supplementary comments on them will
   be found.

   To find these expressions we will not now travel beyond the first
   chapter, except for one expression which occurs seven times in chaps.
   ii. and iii.

   There are sufficient in chap. i. to show us how the Holy Spirit has, at
   the very threshold of this book, used these expressions for our
   consideration and our guidance.

   We find seven of these expressions:-
     __________________________________________________________________

  UNTO HIM THAT LOVED US

   Because "Christ loved His Church and gave Himself for it," we seem
   unable, from our natural selfishness, to rise above or beyond the
   thought of ourselves.

   We, naturally, fill our own vision and see nothing beyond ourselves.

   The thought that Jehovah said of Israel, "Yea, he loved the people,"
   [31] does not enter into our minds for a moment. Gentile hatred of the
   Jew, added to our own natural selfishness, quite cuts out the Jew, not
   only from the Old Testament, but out of the Apocalypse also.

   And yet is it strange, with the repeated assertions which Jehovah makes
   of His love for Israel, that not only should Israel be passed over by
   Bible-students, but this love actually taken from Israel and
   appropriated to the Church; depriving Israel of God's love and
   blessing, and leaving for them only the judgments and the curses.

   And yet we have such passages as these concerning Israel:-

   Deut. vii. 7,8. "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose
   you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the
   fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you, and because he
   would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord
   brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you," etc. (See also
   Deut. vi. 37; xxiii. 5, etc.)

   Hos. xi. 1,4. "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my
   son out of Egypt... I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of
   love."

   Isa. xliii. 4. "Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
   honourable, and I have loved thee."

   Jer. xxxi. 3. "The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I
   have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness
   have I drawn thee."

   And the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, says (Isa. liv. 10), "For the
   mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall
   not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed,
   saith the Lord that hath mercy upon thee."

   We are quite aware that these passages are all appropriated by the
   Church to itself; and, therefore, we can hardly expect them to be
   received in evidence that the words in Rev. i. 5 are not the words
   spoken by the Church. But we must be content to leave the matter here.
   "These are the true sayings of God:" and if people will not believe
   what God says we can hardly expect them to believe what we say.

   Of course we can make an a fortiori application of these words; but
   that is quite another matter. If Israel can say, "unto Him who loveth
   us," how much more can we say so according to Eph. v. 25, Acts xx. 28,
   etc.? But we are dealing now with interpretation; and we must rest
   content with simply stating that, by interpretation, these Old
   Testament passages speak of Jehovah's love to Israel, and not to the
   Church. And, this being so, the words in Rev. i. 5 may we be spoken by
   the godly remnant of Israel, as they will afterwards be the language of
   the whole People.

   We would further anticipate, here, what belongs properly to our
   exposition of chap. ii. 4: The first charge brought against His People
   in this book, viz., "thou hast left thy first love."

   What is this, but what Jehovah calls, in Jer. ii. 2, "the love of thine
   espousals," and in Ezek. xvi. 8, "the time of love." Read the whole of
   Ezek. xvi. and Ex. xix. 4-6, and say whether we have not here the true
   key to Rev. ii. 4.

   But, before we leave this expression, we must give the correct
   rendering of the whole verse (i. 5), according to all the Critical
   Greek Texts and RV. (referring our readers to our further comments in
   the exposition below).

   Unto him who loveth us (it is the present tense, (...) (agaponti)
   loveth, and not (...) (agapesanti) loved; for Jehovah's love for Israel
   is an ever-present love, yea, it is "everlasting") and loosed us (past
   tense, (...) (lusanti) loosed, and not (...) (lousanti) washed) from
   (...) (ek) from or out of; not (...) (apo) away from) our sins by (not
   "in") his blood."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [31] (...) chavav, a very strong word for love, which occurs only in
   Deut. xxxiii. 3, and is taken by "The Chovevi Zion" (the lovers of
   Zion) as the title of that modern Jewish society.
     __________________________________________________________________

  KINGS AND PRIESTS

   the correct text and translation is as follows, and read on from the
   last expression: "And made (not hath made) us (Tregelles read (...)
   (heemin) for us) a kingdom, (all read (...) (basileian) a kingdom;
   instead of (...) (basileis kai) kings and) priests to his God and
   Father (or priests to God, even His Father)."

   we have the same expression in chap. v. 10, where the Greek Text has to
   be corrected in a similar manner.

   There the alteration of the text has been the parent of all the wrong
   translations made of it.

   It is the song, the new song, sung by the four living creatures, and
   the twenty-four elders. [32]

   They say (ver. 9): "Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its
   seals; because thou wast slain and madest a purchase for God (the word
   "us" must be omitted according to Lachmann, Tischendorf, Alford,
   Westcott and Hort, and R.V. There is an Ellipsis. The R.V., having
   taken out "us," has supplied "men" in italics. We may supply "a
   People," or translate as we have done. All the Texts agree in altering
   the pronouns that follow in this and the next verse. This necessitates
   the omission of "us" here. If one is changed, all must be changed for
   the sake of consistency and sense. But this entirely does away with the
   supposition that these heavenly beings were themselves redeemed, or
   were the subject of their own song (See below, on chap. v. 9) by thy
   blood (a purchase, namely) out of every tribe, and tongue, and people,
   and nation, and didst make them (so all the Texts and oldest MSS.) to
   our God (Alford omits these words) a kingdom (so all the Texts and best
   MSS.) and priests, and they shall reign (so all the Texts and oldest
   MSS.) over the earth" (see further on chap. v. 9,10 below).

   Here we have again the expression "a kingdom and priests." While we
   have not a word like this in the Church Epistles, yet we have a passage
   in the Old Testament where very similar words are used, and truth
   declared of Israel. Ex. xix. 5,6: "Ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto
   me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me
   a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation."

   True, these words are found in the New Testament; but they are in the
   Epistle addressed to the sojourners of the Diaspora" [33] : i.e., "the
   Dispersion," a believing remnant of scattered Israel. These are the
   People who are concerned in the promise of Ex. xix. 5,6, and Rev. i. 6
   and v. 10: and not the Church of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [32] The number four and multiple of four (4X6) marks these and their
   song as pertaining to the earth and to man as such, not the Church.

   [33] (...), scattered abroad, came to be the technical term for the
   dispersed portion of Israel. It is found in LXX. Jer. xxxiv. (Sept.
   xli.) 17. Ps. cxlvii. 2 (Sept. cxlvi. 2). Judith v. 19. Compare
   Josephus, Wars, 7.3. In the New Testament we have the word in John vii.
   35. Jas. i. 1. 1 Pet. i. 1. (We may compare the technical use, in
   Holland, of the term "The Beggars").
     __________________________________________________________________

  HIS FATHER

   This is the part of the expression which we have just considered: and
   it is important.

   Twice we have it in this book, spoken of Christ (i. 6 and xiv. 1), but
   not once in the Pauline, or Church Epistles.

   There, in every one of the Epistles addressed to the Churches
   (seventeen times), it is always "OUR" Father. See Rom. i. 7; 1 Cor. i.
   3; 2 Cor. i. 2; Gal. i. 4; Eph. i. 2; Phil. i. 2, iv. 20; Col. i. 2; 1
   Thess. i. 1,3, iii. 11,13; 2 Thess. i. 1,2, ii. 16. Also in 1 Tim. i.
   2; Philem. 3.

   When we say that we have "His Father" in revelation, and never in the
   Epistles; and "our Father" in the Epistles and never in Revelation, we
   have said enough to show that we have here a further point, affording
   its cumulative evidence to our fundamental proposition that the Church
   of God is not the subject of the Apocalypse.
     __________________________________________________________________

  KINGDOM AND PATIENCE

   John is the "brother" specially of those who were of the seed of
   Abraham. The term can hardly be used here, we submit, either of mere
   human brotherhood, or of Christian brotherhood, when all else in this
   chapter and in the book is so evidently stamped with a Jewish
   character.

   John says, I "am your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation
   and kingdom and patience with Jesus."

   Here (according to all the Critical Greek Texts and the R.V.) the words
   "in the" before "kingdom" must be omitted; and the word "in" must be
   inserted before "Jesus": while the word "Christ" must also be omitted
   after "Jesus." The verse then stands as we have here given it. The R.V.
   inserts the italics "which are in Jesus." The word (...) (en), in, may
   well be rendered, with; as it is rendered 138 times in the New
   Testament; and then there is no ellipsis to be supplied.

   Here is companionship in patient waiting. For that is the meaning of
   the word rendered "patience," [34] and it always has the thought of
   endurance underlying it.

   It is a patient-waiting and enduring in tribulation; yet a patient
   waiting and expectation of the "kingdom;" and all this "with Jesus,"
   for "this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat
   down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his
   enemies shall have been placed as a footstool for his feet."

   He is "expecting," and He is also patiently waiting (see 2 Thess. iii.
   5, margin), and so are we with Him, but the waiting referred to here is
   a patient endurance in tribulation and for the kingdom.

   We, too, as members of the Church of God have need of patience, and
   endurance; but we are looking, not for the kingdom, but for the KING
   Himself (not as King, for He is not so proclaimed till His enemies are
   subdued); and though we, too, exercise this patient endurance in
   tribulation, it is not in "the tribulation," but we are waiting to be
   taken away before that tribulation comes upon the earth.

   This expression therefore is worthy of note, and its evidence has to be
   added to the other expressions used.

  OUT OF HIS MOUTH WENT A SHARP TWO

   There can be no question as to the meaning of this expression. The
   (...) (rhomphaia) a sharp or two-edged sword, is four times attributed
   to the Lord in this prophecy, viz., i. 16; ii. 12,16; xix. 15,21. [35]
   And in each case it has to do with slaying and not with speaking; with
   deeds and not with words.

   It is "the captain of the Lord's host" come with his sword (Josh. v.
   13). It is the sword of Jehovah come to execute His judgments (Isa.
   xxxiv. 6); and with which He will plead with His people (Is. lxvi. 16).
   It is the sword referred to under other titles (Isa. xi. 4 and 2 Thess.
   ii. 8), with which, at His coming in judgment, He will destroy the Man
   of Sin, the Lawless one.

   the sword is no priestly weapon; nor can it have any relation to or
   connection with the Church of God in any aspect whatsoever: for grace
   characterises all relations between "Christ and His Church."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] It occurs also in Luke ii. 35, making five times in all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  A GREAT VOICE

   This expression links on the book of Revelation to the book of
   Deuteronomy, especially if we regard it in the connection with the
   fire, with which it is associated in each case.

   Ten times is the voice of God speaking "out of the midst of the fire"
   heard in Deuteronomy: viz., chaps. iv. 12,15,33,36; v. 4,22(19) [36] ,
   23(20), 24(21), 25(21), 26(23).

   Here, in Rev. i. 10, John hears "a great voice," and it is connected
   with fire, for the eyes of the speaker were "as a flame of fire" (ver.
   14) and his feet "as if they burned in a furnace" (ver. 15).

   In Deut. iv. 12 (the first reference) the expression is associated with
   the giving of the Law, and the declaring of Jehovah's Covenant (iv.
   13).

   The second is a command to "take heed" to the voice (iv. 15), and keep
   from idolatry.

   The third and fourth are connected with their turning to the Lord when
   scattered among the nations, seeking Him and finding Him in the
   "Tribulation;" and the being obedient to that voice in "the latter
   days" (iv. 27-36). This tells us of the latter days in Revelation, when
   they will be brought to hear the "Voice" (iv. 33,36), and to attend to
   it.

   The fifth is again associated with God's Covenant to which He will be
   true (v. 4).

   The sixth and seventh with the giving of the Law, v. 22(19), 23(20).

   The eighth with the greatness and the glory of Jehovah (v. 24, Heb.
   21).

   The ninth and tenth are references to it by the People (v. 25,26).

   All these are brought together, and combined, and fulfilled in the
   Apocalypse, when Israel will again hear that Voice and, take heed to
   it, and in their Tribulation turn unto the Lord and seek His face and
   find Him and rejoice in the faithfulness of a covenant-keeping God.

     __________________________________________________________________

  HE THAT HATH AN EAR

   This expression is absolutely Hebrew in its character, origin, and use.
   It is never used with reference to, or in connection with, the Church
   of God.

   By application of course it told those who first read it of the cause
   of all declension - failure to hear what the Spirit had already said to
   the Churches by the Apostle Paul. By application also, it reminds us of
   the same cause today. But the interpretation which will exhaust the
   seven-fold expression is that which leaps over the present Church
   period, and links together the Gospels and Acts with the Apocalypse.

   The expression (which is slightly varied in form) as first used in the
   Gospels is connected solely with, and marks, a change of dispensation.
   When used again in Revelation another great change of dispensation is
   about to take place. It is to be wrought by "the Son of Man," who has
   received authority to show it to "His servants."

   Such a change could be known only to God, ruled and over-ruled by Him.
   None but Divine foreknowledge, therefore, could make it known.

   The Son of Man alone made use of this weighty expression: and on
   fourteen separate occasions He called for the deepest attention to what
   was being announced.

   Now, the number fourteen is most significant; twice seven, denoting a
   special Divine revelation made by "the Son of Man."

   And these fourteen [37] are divided into six and eight (just as seven
   is divided into three and four). For six of them occur in the Gospels
   and eight in the Revelation. Six were spoken by Him as the Son of Man
   on earth, and eight as the Son of Man from glory. Six being the number
   pertaining to man, and eight being the number connected with
   resurrection. [38]

   The six occasions on earth are Matt. xi. 15; xiii. 9,43. Mark iv. 23:
   vii. 16, and Luke xiv. 35.

   The eight from Heaven are Rev. ii. 7,11,17,29; iii. 6,13,22; and xiii.
   9.

   These, like the six in the Gospels, are Dispensational, and are thus
   associated with the great change in God's relation to the earth, to
   "the Jew and the Gentile," which was about to take place.

   The first use of the expression in Matt. xi. 15 is most significant,
   and stamps it as belonging to the setting up of the kingdom with power
   and glory. Elijah's presence on the holy mount characterises the scene
   there as representing the power and coming of that kingdom (Matt. xvi.
   28. 2 Pet. i. 16,17,18), while Mal. iv. 5 (Heb. iii. 23) connects
   Elijah's ministry with the setting up of that kingdom.

   It has been proclaimed of John before his birth "he shall go before Him
   (i.e, Messiah) in the spirit and power of Elijah" (Luke i. 17); and
   again, in Luke i. 76,77, it was announced: "And thou, child, shalt be
   called prophet of the Highest [39] : for thou shalt go before the face
   of the Lord to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto
   his people, by (marg., for) the remission of their sins," etc.

   John the Baptist was therefore invested with Elijah's "spirit and
   power" (i.e., Elijah's spiritual power), and was specially designated
   as "the prophet of the Most High."

   Therefore our Lord could say in Matt. xi. 14,15: "If ye will receive
   him, this is (i.e., represents) Elijah which was for to come. He that
   hath ears to hear, let him hear."

   But "their ears were dull of hearing" (Matt. xiii. 15), fulfilling the
   dispensational prophecy of Isa. vi. 10: Therefore they did not "receive
   him;" and, consequently, "Elijah the prophet" is still to come. Hence
   it is that, in the Book which relates to the events connected with the
   ministry of Elijah and his work in connection with the restoration of
   the kingdom, we again meet with this dispensational admonition: which
   takes us back not merely to Matt. xi. 15, but to Ma. iv. 5, "He that
   hath ears to hear, let him hear."

   Thus we have in the expression another proof that the Church of God is
   not the subject of the Apocalypse; and that we are reading here, not of
   the period belonging to the ministry of Paul the Apostle, or of the
   period of present Church history, as the historicists assert; but, of
   that which belong to the ministry of "Elijah the Prophet."

THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST'S ADVENT (i. 7).

   Another of the points which prove that the Church of God is not the
   subject of the Apocalypse is the character of Christ's Coming which is
   there announced and described; and with which its events are connected.

   This has been already partly shown under the headings of "The Day of
   the Lord" and "The Son of Man." But it is now more definitely stated
   and distinguished.

   The coming of Christ for His Church is quite a different event, and
   belongs to quite a different Dispensation. The end for which the Church
   is waiting is not judgment or tribulation, but to be "received up in
   glory" (1 Tim. iii. 16), to be "called on high" (Phi. iii. 14), to be
   changed and have glorious bodies like our Saviour's own body of glory.
   Their seat of government exists now in heaven, from whence they look
   for the Saviour (Phil. iii. 19-21).

   That coming is into the air, and not unto the earth; it is in grace,
   and not in judgment; it concerns those who are "in Christ," and not
   either Jew or Gentile as such.

   Nothing is revealed in the Old Testament or in the Gospels about this
   coming. Those books know nothing of it. This coming concerns the
   Mystery, which was kept secret from times eternal, and was "hid in
   God." The church of God (which is the Mystery) waits for one thing as
   its consummation, and that is to be "received up into glory" (1 Tim.
   iii. 16). But this is not the subject of the Apocalypse.

   To make this more clear we must compare what we call the "second"
   Advent with the "first."

   When the Coming of the Lord was announced in Micah, v. 2, it was
   announced as a coming forth; and in Zech. ix. as a coming unto. The
   former speaks of the coming forth at Bethlehem, the latter of the
   coming unto Jerusalem.

   There was nothing in those prophecies to tell the Jewish reader whether
   there would be any interval between these events, or what that interval
   would be. The Jewish Bible student might think there was a discrepancy;
   while the Jew with the mind of a "higher critic" might see a greater
   difficulty, and refuse to believe either Scripture.

   But we, today, with our knowledge, know that there was an interval of
   more than thirty years between the two events. Both refer to one and
   the same Coming, but to two different stages in it; and that all the
   events between them go to make up what we speak of as the "first
   Coming."

   We believe that it will be exactly the same with regard to what we call
   the "second Coming." There will be the same two stages, with a similar
   interval (or longer it may be) between them, and all the events (which
   are recorded in the Apocalypse and elsewhere) will go to make up what
   we speak of as "the second Coming."

   There will be the coming forth (as at Bethlehem) of "the Lord Himself"
   and the calling of His saints on high (Phil. iii. 14), and the
   receiving of them in glory (1 Tim. iii. 16); and then, later on, to
   fulfil all the prophecies which related to His People Israel; and, as
   the Son of man will "come unto" the earth, to take unto Himself His
   great power, and reign.

   This latter coming is connected with "the Day of the Lord," and it is
   that which is the subject of the Book of Revelation.

   Chap. i. 7 settles this for us: "Behold, He cometh with clouds; and
   every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
   kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him."

   Only Jew and Gentile are in this verse, and not the Church of God.

   This is the Coming of which the Old Testament speaks. It knows no
   other. See Dan. vii. 13 and Zech. xii. 9,10, which is the Scripture
   referred to here. [40]

   This is the Coming which the Lord spoke of when on earth in Matt. xxiv.
   30,31; xxvi. 64, and elsewhere (mark the "ye"). What He there said is
   perfectly clear, and in perfect harmony with all that had been said in
   the Old Testament. To read Eph., Phil., and Col. into the Gospels is
   only to create confusion; and make a difficulty where none before
   existed: it is to use one truth for the upsetting of another truth.

   The same difficulty is created when we arbitrarily introduce these
   later Prison Epistles of Paul into the Apocalypse.

   To save us from making such a disastrous mistake, the Holy spirit gave
   special instruction in 1 Thess. v., immediately after He had inspired
   the revelation of 1 Thess iv. If we heed this and learn its great and
   important lesson, all will be perfectly clear.

   1 Thess. v. 1. "But of the times and the season, brethren, ye have no
   need that I write unto you."

   Why, "no need"? Simply because the Coming forth into the air and our
   "gathering together unto Him" there, do not depend on any time or
   season. His "Coming unto" the earth does; but that is not what he had
   been speaking about in the chapter immediately before (Thess. iv.).

   2. "For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as
   a thief in the night."

   It is the "day of the Lord" which (as we have seen above) is the
   subject of the Apocalypse: and in Rev. iii. 3, the Lord distinctly
   warns as to His Coming "as a thief," which is the very opposite of what
   we read of in Eph., Phil., and Col., and even in 1 Thess. iv., v. For
   mark the sudden change of pronouns in the latter chapters.

   3. "For when THEY shall say, 'Peace and safety,' then sudden
   destruction cometh upon THEM...and THEY shall not escape."

   It is this "destruction" which the Apocalypse describes. It is this
   which gives its character to "the day of the Lord." It is "sudden," and
   comes "as a thief;" and it comes upon "THEM" and "THEY," not upon us:
   for mark the change of pronouns again.

   4. "But YE, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
   overtake YOU as a thief."

   Here, our point is distinctly, emphatically, and categorically stated,
   with a precision and explicitness which leaves nothing to be added. Can
   anything be more clear than the fact that the Church of God is not the
   subject of the Apocalypse? And that the "Coming" which is the subject
   of this book is not the Coming for which the Church of God is now
   longing, waiting, and looking?

   If some of our points are cumulative in their evidence, this one point,
   by itself, is sufficient to establish our fundamental proposition that
   the Church of God is not the subject of the book of Revelation, either
   in prophecy or in history.

   The book is "prophecy," as we have seen; and therefore it awaits a
   future fulfilment in "the day of the Lord," when the Lord Jesus shall
   be unveiled as the Son of man, and every eye shall see Him.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] It might be rendered "the Land" better than "earth" in Rev. i. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE VISION OF THE SON OF MAN.

   This is essential, for it is directly associated with the object and
   purpose of the book.

   The only other place in the whole Bible where we have anything like it
   is in Daniel x. 5,6, where in every particular the resemblance is the
   same. His girdle is of gold; His eyes as fire; His feet as brass; His
   voice as many waters (Rev.), and as a multitude (Dan.); His countenance
   as the sun (Rev.) and the appearance as lightening (Dan.).

   In Daniel it is "a certain man" (Heb. one - a man). In Rev. it is "one
   like unto the Son of Man."

   The Two Visions being identical as to the Person and as to His
   appearance, and also as to the effect on Daniel and John respectively,
   it is not more than probably that the purpose is also the same in each
   case?

   In Daniel we are expressly told why the Vision was sent. "Now I am come
   to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter
   days; for yet the vision is for many days... I will shew thee that
   which is noted in the scripture of truth" (Dan. x. 14, 21).

   The expression, "thy People," is most significant. It is not the Church
   of God which is in question, but Daniel's People, Israel. This People
   had been the subject of Daniel's prayer (Dan. ix. 4-19). He call them
   (in speaking to God) "Thy People" (vv. 15, 19); and in the answer to
   the prayer (ix. 24), as well as here (x. 14) and in xii. 1, the angel
   speaks of them to Daniel as "thy people." [41]

   Is it not certain that this People is the subject, and what is to
   befall them in the latter day is precisely the import, of the vision
   which John saw in Rev. i. 13-16.

   It had been given to that glorious One to show unto His servants things
   which shall be "hereafter," and that was what was to befall Daniel's
   people (Israel) "in the latter days."

   In Rev. we have "the latter days" - even "the Day of the Lord," and the
   time has come to show John that which is noted in the scripture of
   truth.

   The people, therefore, who are the subjects of the Revelation, are
   Daniel's People, and not the Church of God.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] It is beautiful to notice that when Daniel confesses the sins of
   this People he uses, throughout, the pronouns, "we," "us," and "our"
   (see verses 5-10, 14-16). But when he pleads with God for them on the
   ground of the everlasting covenant, it is always "Thy": "Thy People,"
   "Thy City," "Thy Sanctuary," "Thy righteousness," Thy great mercies,"
   "Thy Name's sake."
     __________________________________________________________________

THE COMPLEMENT OF GENESIS.

   The Apocalypse is connected very closely with the Old Testament, and
   not as we have seen with the New; with Genesis, and not with the Church
   Epistles.

   Indeed, the connection between Genesis and Revelation is so marked that
   many have noticed it.

   It will be only necessary for us therefore to exhibit the likenesses
   and contrasts in parallel columns. No comment will be necessary.

   In Genesis we have the book of the Beginning; in revelation the book of
   the End (not the whole period which we call A.D., but the end of it).

   The Apocalypse completes all that Genesis begins, and introduces the
   New Creation, lest we should think there is nothing beyond.

   In Genesis we have therefore the primal creation and the history of the
   curse which came upon it: Revelation tells how that curse will be
   removed, and the New Creation brought in.

   In Genesis we have Satan's first revolt, and in Revelation his final
   revolt. The parallel between the two books may be thus set forth: -

   Genesis

   Revelation

   The Earth created (i. 1)

   Earth passed away (xxi. 1).

   Sun, moon and stars for Earth's government (i. 14-16).

   Sun, moon and stars connected with Earth's judgment (vi. 12; viii. 12;
   xvi. 8).

   Sun to govern the day (i. 16).

   No need of the sun (xxx. 23).

   Darkness called night (i. 5).

   "No night there" (xxii. 5).

   Waters called seas (i. 10).

   "No more sea" (xxi. 1).

   A river for Earth's blessing (ii. 10-14).

   A river for the New Earth (xxii. 1,2).

   Man in God's image (i. 26).

   Man headed by one in Satan's image (xiii.)

   Entrance of sin (iii.).

   Development and end of sin.

   Curse pronounced (iii. 14,17).

   "No more curse" (xxii. 3).

   Death entered (iii. 19).

   "No more death" (xxi. 4).

   Cherubim first mentioned in connection
   with man (iii. 24).

   Cherubim final mention in connection with man.

   Man driven out from Eden (iii. 24).

   Man restored (xxii.).

   Tree of life guarded (iii. 24).

   "Right to the Tree of Life" (xxii. 14).

   Sorrow and suffering enter (iii. 17).

   No more sorrow (xxii. 4).

   Man's religion, art, and science, resorted to
   for enjoyment apart from God (iv.).

   Man's religion, luxury, art, and science, in their full glory judged
   and destroyed by God (xviii.).

   Nimrod, a great rebel and King, and hidden anti-God, the founder of
   Babylon (x. 8-10).

   The Beast, the great Rebel, a King, and manifested anti-God, the
   reviver of Babylon (xiii., xviii.).

   A flood from God to destroy an evil generation (vi.-ix.).

   A flood from Satan to destroy an elect generation (xii.).

   The bow the token of God's covenant with the Earth (ix. 13).

   The bow, betokening God's remembrance of His covenant with the Earth
   (iv. 3; x. 1).

   Sodom and Egypt, the place of corruption and temptation (xiii., xix.).

   Sodom and Egypt again (spiritually representing Jerusalem) (xi. 8).

   A confederacy against Abraham's people overthrown (xiv.).

   A confederacy against Abraham's seed overthrown (xii.).

   Marriage of first Adam (ii. 18-23).

   Marriage of last Adam (xix.).

   A bride sought for Abraham's son (Isaac) and found (xxiv.).

   A Bride made ready and brought to Abraham's Son (xix. 9). See Matt. i.
   1.

   Two angels acting for God on behalf of His People (xix.).

   Two witnesses acting for God on behalf of His people (xi.).

   A promised seed to possess the gate of his enemies (xxix. 8).

   The promised seed coming into possession.

   Man's dominion ceased and Satan's begun (iii. 24).

   Satan's dominion ended and man's restored (xxii.).

   Sun, moon and stars associated with Israel (xxxvii.).

   Sun, moon and stars associated again with Israel (xii.).

   Therefore

   The Church not preconfigured.

                                The Church not to be looked for.


   It is surely impossible for us to read these solemn parallels and
   contrast without coming to the conclusion that there must be the
   closest possible connection between the two books.

   They are joined together by God in a way so that no man can put them
   asunder.

   God has joined the Revelation to Genesis; man joins it with the
   Epistles.

   God has joined it with Jews, Gentile and the Earth; man joins it with
   Christendom.

   God has joined it with what He had before written in Genesis; man joins
   it with what man has written himself in Church history!

   Can perversity go further than this? Is it any wonder that the book is
   misunderstood by so many, and neglected by most? For what can be made
   of it when such elements of confusion are introduced?

   When God has placed the key to the book at the very threshold, in the
   first chapter, man deliberately ignores it, and makes another, which he
   presents to those who would fain enter; but, when it is tried, it is
   found that none of the wards fit the lock, and the door either has to
   be forced, or all hope of entrance abandoned!

   And yet, when we look at the general scope of the book which will be
   given later on, how wonderous it is! How Divinely perfect! And, at the
   same time, how simple and easy! So simple that a child can become
   interested in it, and the humblest saint understand it.

     __________________________________________________________________

THE SUMMARY OF ITS CONTENTS (i. 19).

   In chapter i. 19 we have the summary of the contents of the whole book.

   It is the misunderstanding of this verse which, we believe, has led so
   many astray, and turned so many into the wrong channel. This verse is
   usually taken as referring to three things, marking off the book into
   three divisions:

   The things which thou sawest (past). The things which are (present).
   The things which shall be hereafter (future).

   Having got these three divisions, then comes a difference of opinion as
   to exactly where and how these contents of the Book are to be divided.

   But there is another rendering which we wish to present, suggested, in
   part, by Moses Stuart and Dean Alford. This removes all such
   difficulties, and shows that there is no such three-fold division; and
   that instead of three subjects we have only one.

   John was instructed to write what he had seen. It is clear, therefore,
   that this first chapter is the Introduction to the whole Book, and
   consequently, like all other Introductions, is written, or supposed to
   be written, last of all. For, at the very commencement (in i. 2), it is
   said of John that he "bare record of the Word of God (i.e., as we have
   seen, the prophetic message), and of the testimony of Jesus Christ
   (which He bore) and of all things that he saw."

   If this chapter then be not written after John had see these things,
   the words are without meaning; for in that case John had as yet seen
   nothing!

   Verse 19 (which we are considering) is part of this Introduction, and
   therefore the words "which thou sawest" are used in the same sense as
   in verse 2. John had seen, or is supposed to have seen, all the Visions
   of the Book when the command to write was given to him. This explains
   why the word "therefore" must be added in the Greek (according to all
   the Critical Greek Texts and the R.V.). Moreover, it is specially
   declared at the very end of the book (chap. xxii. 16), "I Jesus have
   sent mine angel to testify unto THESE THINGS in the assemblies":
   showing that "the things which thou sawest" refer, not as is generally
   supposed, only to the things in chap. i., but to the contents of the
   whole book.

   Having seen all these things the command is - "Write therefore the
   things which thou sawest, and what they are (i.e., what they signify),
   [42] even the things which shall come to pass (i.e., happen, as in Acts
   xxvi. 22) hereafter."

   According to this rendering, which may be rejected as an
   interpretation, but cannot be condemned as a translation, there is only
   one thing stated as the subject-matter of what was to be written, and
   not three things. It relates not to past, present, and future, but to
   the future alone - "hereafter," or, as it says in Dan. xi. 14, "in the
   latter days."

   Some lay a stress on the words (...), meta tauta, which mean literally
   after these things. But an examination of other places where they occur
   will show that when used in narrative they may imply historical
   sequence (as in Luke v. 27; x. 1; xii. 4; xvii. 8; xviii. 4. John iii.
   22; v. 14; vii. 1; xix. 38; xii. 1. Acts xiii. 20; xviii. 1); yet when
   used in connection with promise or prophecy, they, as naturally, are
   indefinite, hereafter. (John xiii. 7. Acts vii. 7. 1 Peter i. 1, where
   it is rendered "should follow," and has not followed even yet). In any
   case, the A.V. and R.V. both render the expression "hereafter" where it
   occurs in Revelation, viz., i. 19; iv. 1; and ix. 12, in a prophetic
   sense.

   There is no necessity therefore for anyone to regard any portion of the
   book as relating to the present church period. This (in which we live)
   is the Dispensation of the Holy Spirit; but that (which is the subject
   of the Revelation) is wholly the Dispensation of the Son of Man - the
   revelation or unveiling and manifestation of Jesus Christ.

   That is still future. The book which describes it must likewise be
   future also, and relate only to "the things which shall be hereafter."
   See further notes on chap. i. 19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] As to this rendering, "and what they ARE," the verb to be is
   constantly translated to mean or signify. See Matt. ix. 13: "But go ye
   and learn what that IS" (A.V. and R.V. meaneth). Matt. xii. 7: "but if
   ye had known what that IS" (A.V. and R.V. meaneth). Luke xv. 26: "He
   asked what these things WERE" (A.V. meant; R.V. might be). Acts ii. 12:
   "What IS this?" (A.V. and R.V. What meaneth this). Acts x. 17: "Now,
   while Peter doubted in himself what this vision WAS which he had seen"
   (A.V. What this vision should mean; R.V. might mean). So, "and what
   they ARE" should be rendered "and what they mean," or signify.

THE SEVEN ASSEMBLIES AS A WHOLE (i.11).

   We must here, at the outset, remove the greatest source of all the
   misunderstandings which have arisen with regard to these seven
   "churches."

   The fact of their being called "churches" has naturally led
   commentators and students of this book to infer that it is the Church
   of God, or at any rate the historic Christian Church, which is meant.

   The difficulty is thus arbitrarily created. The Bible student is at
   once confronted with an overwhelming difficulty. He has read the
   Epistles which are addressed to the churches by the Holy Spirit through
   the Apostle Paul; and, on turning to the Epistles in Rev. ii. and iii.,
   he is at once conscious of a striking change. He finds himself suddenly
   removed from the ground of grace to the ground of works. He meets with
   church-officers of whom he has never before heard; and with expressions
   with which he is wholly unfamiliar: and he is bewildered.

   Two courses are open to him: either to try and force the words into a
   meaning to suit both, thus lowering the standard of the Church of God,
   and the Christian's own standing in Christ; or, to invent some purely
   imaginary interpretation and baseless hypothesis by applying them to
   Christendom, and holding that instead of seven assemblies we have seven
   stages of Church history: some going so far as to give the very years
   which mark off these periods.

   Those who feel this to be a very difficult task, and lack the knowledge
   of history which is absolutely essential to this system of
   interpretation, wonder why God gave to Jesus Christ to show unto His
   servants what must come to pass hereafter, and yet expected them to
   become deep students of history in order to understand what He has
   revealed!

   No wonder that most Bible readers, after struggling for a time with
   this fantastic idea, give it all up in despair; abandoning the reading
   of the book, and losing the "blessing" which is pronounced upon its
   readers.

   As a first step toward removing this great evil, let us note at once
   that the word (...) (ecclesia), rendered "church," is by no means
   limited to the restricted sense which is thus forced upon it.

   Ecclesia means simply an Assembly: any assembly of people who are
   called out (for that is the etymological meaning of the word) from
   other people.

   Hence, it is used of the whole nation of Israel as distinct from other
   nations.

   The Greek word Ecclesia occurs seventy-five times in the Septuagint
   Translation of the Old Testament, and is used as the rendering of five
   different Hebrew words. As it is used to represent one of these,
   seventy times, we need not concern ourselves with the other four words.

   This Hebrew word is (...) (Cahal), from which we have our English word
   call. It means to call together, to assemble, or gather together, and
   is used of any assembly gathered together for any purpose. This Hebrew
   word Cahal occurs 123 times, and is rendered: "congregation," 86 times;
   "assembly," 17; "company," 17; and "multitude," 3 times: but is never
   rendered "church." Its first occurrence is in Gen. xxviii. 3 - "that
   thou mayest be a multitude (margin, assembly) of people," i.e., a
   called-out people. That is what Israel was, a people called out and
   assembled from all other peoples.

   In Gen. xlix. 6 we read - "O my soul, come not thou into their secret
   (Council or Senate); Unto their assembly (cahal), mine honour, be not
   thou united."

   Here the word cahal is used, not of all Israel as called out from the
   nations, but of the assembly of those called out of form the Tribal
   Assembly (or Council) of the tribes of Simeon and Levi.

   Then, it is used of the worshippers, or those called out from Israel,
   and assembled before the Tabernacle and Temple, and in this sense is
   usually rendered "congregation." This is the meaning of the word in Ps.
   xxii. 22: "In the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee;" and
   verse 25: "My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation."

   This is the usage of the word in the Gospels, and even in the Acts of
   the Apostles before the new use, which the Holy Spirit was going to
   make of the word, was revealed.

   When Christ said, "Upon this rock will I build my Ecclesia," He did not
   use the word in the exclusive sense in which it was afterwards to be
   used, but in the older and larger sense in which the word had been
   before used, which would embrace the whole assembly of His People,
   while not excluding the future application of the word to the Church or
   Body of Christ when that secret should have been in due season
   revealed.

   When the Spirit, by Stephen, speaks of the Ecclesia in the wilderness
   (Acts vii. 38), he means the congregation of pious worshippers of God
   at the Tabernacle.

   When the Lord added to the Ecclesia daily (Acts ii. 47), He added to
   the number of those 120, who first assembled themselves together in the
   upper room in Jerusalem.

   When Saul says he persecuted the Ecclesia of God, he does not use the
   word in the limited sense, which it subsequently acquired after he had
   received the special revelation concerning it: but in the sense in
   which it had been used up to, and in which it was used at, that time.
   It means merely that he persecuted the People of God - the congregation
   of God. He is speaking of a past act in his life which took place long
   before the revelation of the secret, and his words must be interpreted
   accordingly. We must not read into any of these passages that which was
   the subject of a subsequent revelation! which passages are perfectly
   clear without it. The word Ecclesia in the Old Testament, the Gospels,
   and (for the most part) in the Acts, must be taken in the sense of its
   earlier usage as meaning simply the congregation or assembly of the
   Lord's people, and not in the sense which it acquired, after the later
   and special signification had been given to it by the Holy Spirit
   Himself.

   As we have already abundantly shewn, in the consideration of our
   foregoing thirteen points, the Apocalypse is linked on to the Old
   Testament, the Gospels, and the Acts (and not to the later Pauline
   Epistles), and we ought to use the word Ecclesia in the sense in which
   it is there used; and not, surely, in the newer and special sense which
   it acquired, and in which it is used, in the Epistles.

   In the Pauline Epistles we read nothing about an "angel" as having to
   do with the churches of God which Paul planted.

   But we do meet with the word Angel in connection with the Synagogue;
   (though not in the Old Testament). There, there was an officer, who was
   called Sheliach Tzibbur (...): Tzibbur meaning Assembly; and Sheliach,
   the Angel or Legate of the Assembly, and the Leader of Divine worship,
   from (...) (shalach) to send.

   The chief officer was the Archisynagogos, or "Ruler of the Synagogue;"
   and after him came the Sheliach Tzibbur; or "Angel of the Assembly,"
   who was the mouthpiece of the congregation. His duty it was to offer up
   public prayer to God for the whole congregation. Hence his title;
   because, as the messenger of the assembly, he spoke to God for them.
   [43]

   When we have these facts to our hands, why arbitrarily invent the
   notion that "angel" is equivalent to Bishop, when there is not a
   particle of historical evidence for it?

   Episcopoi, or Bishops, are clearly spoken of in other parts of the New
   Testament (though not in the modern sense of the term. See Acts xx. 28;
   Phil. i. 1; 1 Tim. iii. 2; Tit. i. 7). But the office of "Angel" in the
   Church of God is never used either inside or outside the Word of God.
   One might just as well argue for the popular interpretation of the word
   "angel," from the fact that the word has been so used and applied by
   the "Catholic Apostolic" Church within recent times.

   Add to this the use of the word synagogue, which we have in Rev. ii. 9
   and iii. 9. Here again translators mislead us. For, while the Greek
   word occurs 57 times in the New Testament, and is translated synagogue
   55 times, it is rendered "assembly" in Jas. ii. 2, and "congregation"
   in Acts xiii. 43.

   It should, of course, be rendered synagogue in these two places, as
   well as in all the others, as it is in the R.V. (though in Jas. ii. 2
   it has assembly in the margin). Had the A.V. so rendered it in Jas. ii.
   it would have marked and emphasised the fact that James wrote "to the
   Twelve Tribes which are scattered abroad," and would have shown how his
   epistle has a present point of appeal to the scattered people, [44] as
   well as a direct future application to them, like that of the seven
   epistles in Rev. ii. and iii. In any case, the use of the word
   "synagogue" in Rev. ii. 9 and iii. 9 stamps these Epistles as Jewish,
   Satan's synagogue being put in opposition to the other assemblies.

   When the word Ecclesia, in the Apocalypse is rendered "Church," and the
   word "Synagogue" in Rev. ii. 9 and iii. 9, is interpreted of the
   church, it is playing fast and loose with the "words which the Holy
   Ghost speaketh," and which He has employed, not only for His
   revelation, but for our instructions.

   We hold that the Apocalypse contains a record (by vision and prophecy)
   of the events which shall happen "hereafter" in the Day of the Lord;
   that the whole book is concerned with the Jew, the Gentile, and the
   Earth, but not with the Church of God, or with Christendom; or with the
   latter only so far as the present corruption of Christianity shall
   merge in the great apostasy, and form part of it, after the Church, the
   Body of Christ, shall have been removed.

   But there will be a people for God on the earth during those eventful
   years. There will be the remnant of believing Israelites; the 144,000
   sealed ones; the great multitude; and other bodies of faithful ones who
   are referred to all through the Book (see chaps. vii., xi., and xii.
   17). In which latter passage we read of "the remnant of her (the
   woman's) seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
   testimony of Jesus Christ."

   Will not these need special instruction? Have these been forgotten by
   Him who sees the end from the beginning? The Pauline Epistles will of
   course be of use as an historical record of what will then be past,
   just as we have the record of Israel's history in the Old Testament
   now.

   Our answer to these questions is that God has provided for their
   instruction, and warning, and encouragement, in the second and third
   chapters of this book.

   Right at the beginning they are the first subjects of Divine
   remembrance, provision, and care. Their needs must be first provided
   for, before anything else is recorded of the things which John saw; and
   there they will find what is specially written for their learning.

   Even now, the nucleus of this Remnant is being prepared. Hundreds of
   Jews are believing in Christ as the Messiah, who know nothing of Him as
   the Saviour. And even among the unbelievers in Israel a political
   movement is on foot which may speedily lead up to and issue in the
   events of which Revelation treats.

   Of course this means that we are to consider the interpretation of Rev.
   ii. and iii. as future, and belonging to the "hereafter." As to
   application, we, of course, quite understand, and readily admit that
   these epistles have been read by the saints of God all through the
   ages; and all who have thus read them have received a blessing
   according to the promise. We may so read them now, ourselves, and apply
   them, so far as we can do so consistently with the teaching for this
   dispensation of grace, contained in the Pauline Epistles. Applying
   these thus we leave the full and final interpretation for those to whom
   it will specially belong hereafter.

   Few are aware that the evidence as to the existence of these assemblies
   as churches is very scanty. Indeed, concerning some, not only is
   evidence wanting; but concerning others it is quite opposed to their
   ever having existed at all.

   Tertullian [45] (about 145-200) says that leaders of certain sects,
   such as Cerdon and Marcion, rejected the Apocalypse on the ground that
   it could not have been written by John, inasmuch as (among other
   reasons) there was no Christian Church in existence at Thyatira in the
   time of John.

   Epiphanius (who wrote about A.D. 367) deals with the Alogi, a sect
   which disputed the genuineness of the Apocalypse, and on the same
   grounds. He quotes their words: "moreover, some of the [the Alogi]
   again seize on this passage in this same Apocalypse [Rev. ii. 18]. And
   they allege, by way of opposition, that it is again said: 'write to the
   angel of the Church which is in Thyatira,' although there was no
   Christian Church in Thyatira. How then could he write to a church which
   was not in existence?" [46]

   The answer of Epiphanius acknowledged the historical fact: but his
   answer was that St. John wrote to the church at Thyatira, not because
   it was then in existence, but because it would be at some future time.

   We do not see how he could have given a better answer.

   In A.D. 363 was held the Council of Laodicea. It was attended by
   thirty-two bishops of Asia, among whom was the bishop of Ephesus. This
   Council framed a list or canon of the sacred books, but the Apocalypse
   was not included in the catalogue.

   How can we account for this as a historical fact if these seven
   churches were all then existent; and if these epistles were sent to
   them at the time, Laodicea being one of them?

   The facts being what they are, the enemies of the Bible draw from them
   an entirely false conclusion. They use them against the authenticity
   and genuineness of the Apocalypse, and against its claim to a place in
   the Canon of Scripture.

   We, on the contrary, strongly hold the canonicity and inspiration of
   the Apocalypse, but we use the undoubted historical facts against a
   false system of interpretation which is a very different thing.

   An opponent of the Bible, in a large and important work, uses the
   common system of a apocalyptic interpretation as an argument against
   all Scripture. Speaking of Revelation, he says, "As all parties admit
   that it contains the destiny of the church, each sect has applied it to
   itself, frequently to the exclusion of all others."

   All parties, we are thankful to say, do not admit to the popular system
   of interpretation; and our present object is to show that there is a
   "more excellent way," not of interpreting it, but of believing it; a
   way which, while it honours it as the word of God, satisfactorily meets
   the erroneous conclusions drawn from facts.

   If these "churches" are future assemblies of Jewish believers on the
   earth, after the Church has been "caught up to meet the Lord," then all
   is clear, consistent, and easy to be understood.

   The real difficulty is created by attempting to read the Church into
   the book where it has no place.

   As to the "seven lamp-stands," ought not this expression at once to
   send our thoughts back to the one golden lamp-stand of the Tabernacle
   (Exod. xxv. 31-39). ONE lamp-stand with seven lamps, indicative of
   Israel's unity in the Land and in the City? Here, the scattered
   condition of the nation is just as distinctly indicated by the fact
   that the seven lamps are no longer united in one lamp-stand. The nation
   is no longer in the Land, for Jerusalem is not now the center; but the
   people are "scattered" in separate communities in various cities in
   Gentile lands. So that just as the one lamp-stand represents Israel in
   its unity, the seven lamp-stands represent Israel in its dispersion;
   and tells us that Jehovah is about to make Jerusalem again the center
   of His dealings with the earth.

   We must further note that John was not told to send seven separate
   letters to seven separate assemblies, as is generally assumed and
   believed. Indeed the contrary is the fact. The great Voice said, "What
   thou seest, write in A BOOK and send IT unto the seven assemblies."

   Over three-quarters of a million copies of this Book of the Revelation
   have in the last few years been placed in the hands of the Jews
   throughout the world. We allude to the Salkinson-Ginsburg translation
   of the New Testament in Hebrew, published by the Trinitarian Bible
   Society, and distributed by the Mildmay Mission to the Jews, and by
   other similar agencies throughout the world.

   So that "the book" has been and is being sent to those for whom it was
   written, and at no distant day many assemblies of Jews will hear and
   read the words of this prophecy, and a people be prepared who will keep
   "the words of this prophecy," and receive in a special manner the
   blessing pronounced in i. 3.

   They will be able to understand what is now so inexplicable to Gentile
   Christian readers. We find nothing in our Pauline Church Epistles that
   fits into what is said to these assemblies. But those readers will be
   at once reminded of the various stages of their own past history, and
   they will find in almost every sentence some allusion to the
   circumstances in which they will find themselves as described in this
   book.

   We will show this; first, from the references made to their past
   history; and when we come to deal with these Epistles separately, we
   will, in some circumstance in the Apocalypse itself, give a reference
   to nearly every sentence in these seven Epistles.

   It is a remarkable fact that

   Seven past phases of Israel's history

   are referred to in these Epistles: and the literary order in Revelation
   corresponds with, and answers to, the historical order in the Old
   Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

  EPHESUS

   In the Epistle to the Assembly at Ephesus, the reference is to Exodus:
   to God's love in choosing them out of Egypt, and them making them a
   nation. See Hos. xi. 1: "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and
   called my son out of Egypt." In Jer. ii. 2 we see this "first love,"
   which Jehovah calls "the love of thine espousals." And in Ezek. xvi. we
   have a full description of the workings and outcome of this "first
   love." The whole of Ezek. xvi. must be read with Ex. xix. 4-6. It is
   this "first love" which Israel is here charged with having "left." This
   is the beginning of all the subsequent evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SMYRNA

   In Smyrna, we have a reference to a definite time of trial.. In the
   wilderness it was forty years. Here it is ten days. If any wish to make
   this stand for ten years it must be on their own responsibility. We
   only press the point that a corresponding time of trial is referred to;
   and that it is a definite and limited time.

   We are aware of the "interpretation" proposed as to there having been
   ten persecutions of "Christians" between A.D. 57 and 284. But
   unfortunately for this theory, there is nothing said here as to any
   number of separate persecutions: but only as to the duration of one! It
   is evident that no system of interpretation which is based on such
   imaginations will be of any service to us in our understanding of this
   book.

   The year-day system, as a principle of prophetic interpretation, is a
   human invention; and as unnecessary as it is mischievous.

   When God says a "day" He means a day, and when He says a year He means
   a year. Even in those very passages where He makes one day to stand for
   a year, the words are used in each case in their literal sense and
   natural meaning.

   When the spies were gone 40 days, and Israel was made to wander 40
   years ("a year for a day"), "day" means day and "year" means year (Num.
   xiv. 34). Because God thus orders it here, we have no authority to do
   this on our own responsibility in every other place.

   When Ezekiel was told to lie on his left side 390 days, it does not
   mean that he was thus to lie for 390 years! And when Jehovah says, "I
   have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number
   of the days, 390 days" (Ezek. iv. 4,5), it is clear that "days" means
   days, and "years" means years.

   And when Ezekiel does the same with respect to Judah, 40 days, Jehovah
   says, "I have appointed thee each day for a year" (Ezek. iv. 6, and see
   margin). We have the same plain and literal statement of facts.

   When human interpreters take upon themselves to "appoint" the same in
   other cases, whether 1260 days or "ten days," or any other number, they
   incur a very grave responsibility. They do not adopt this "system" in
   other prophecies, and dare not. For when, in Gen. vii. 4, God says,
   "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain on the earth forty
   days and forty nights," it is said to have been so fulfilled. (vers.
   10, 12).

   When, in Gen. xl. 12, 13, it is said "the three branches are three
   days," the fulfillment is given in verse 20: - "And it came to pass on
   the third day," etc. (not year).

   When God prophesied of the flesh that He would give Israel to eat, the
   days meant days (Num. xi. 19, 20).

   So here, in Rev. ii. 9, the expression "ten days" means ten days: and
   many Jews in many cities already know what it is to suffer an
   anti-Semite tribulation for days together. Why not here and under these
   circumstances?

   Haman had one day given to him to "destroy the Jews"! Why not another
   "Jews' enemy" be allowed ten days?

   And what is this or any such period to do with the Church of God, which
   has nothing whatever to do with "times and seasons" (1 Thess. v. 1)?

   It is quite probable that the time referred to here may that of Matt.
   xxiv. 9, 10, and Isa. lxvi. 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PERGAMOS

   In Pergamos we have the reference to Balaam, which will have its
   counterpart in a yet future day.

   Through "the counsel of Balaam" (Num. xxxi. 16, etc.) Israel was
   entrapped and led into the worst form of Midianitish idolatry, when
   "Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor" (Num. xxv. 3).

   In the coming future day Pergamos will be in a special manner the seat
   (or throne) of Satan (ii. 13; and compare xiii. 2), and a form of
   idolatry more awful than that of Baal-peor will be on the earth. Peter,
   writing to the Dispersion, tells of this future time in 2 Peter ii.,
   and in verse 15 he speaks specially of their "following in the way of
   Balaam the son of Bosor."

   Jude also connects his description of a similar phase of idolatry with
   "the error of Balaam" (verses 10-13).

   It is clear, therefore, that that special feature of idolatry connected
   with Balaam's "counsel" is referred to in Rev. ii. 14, and will be
   revived in the period described in the Apocalypse.

   And, as, upon this great evil the special judgment of the "sword" was
   sent and executed (Num. xxxi. 1-15), so here. He who speaks to the same
   People of the same evil, speaks also of the same judgment, "I will
   fight against them with the sword of my mouth" (Rev. ii. 16), which
   threat will be carried out in chap. xix. 21. This is why we have that
   special mention of the "sharp sword," describing the speaker in ii. 12,
   referring to the same feature of the Vision as seen in i. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THYATIRA

   In the Epistle to Thyatira we have the reference to another and more
   intensified form of idolatry as developed and established in the days
   of Ahab, king of Israel; another who, like Balaam, "made Israel to sin"
   (1 Kings xvi. 30).

   Ahab was the first king who officially introduced and organised he most
   abominable form of heathen idolatry that the human mind ever conceived
   (1 Kings xvi. 33). See Revised Version, where the special significance
   of this abomination is conveyed and contained in the word "Asherah." To
   particularise on this form of idolatry would be only to defile the
   mind. The Lord Himself in this Epistle (Rev. ii. 20-24) gives a clue to
   it. We may, perhaps, add that what was introduced into Israel by Balaam
   (see Rev. ii. 14) became elevated into a national religious system
   under Ahab and Jezebel, as it had long been recognised among the
   heathen nations around.

   What that religious system of licentious idolatry was is well known;
   but something may be gathered from a recently-discovered Papyrus, [47]
   containing about a sixth of the Ascension of Isaiah, which had before
   been known only in an Ethiopic Translation (except a mutilated
   Lectionary in Paris). The origin of this Papyrus is very ancient, and
   its historical facts may be taken as correct, separated from its
   vaticinations. It says, speaking of the condition of things in the days
   of Israel's Kings - "And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve
   Beliar [i.e., Belial]; for the angel of lawlessness who ruleth this
   world is Beliar, whose name is Malambuchus. And he delighted in
   Jerusalem because of Manasseh, and made him strong in Jerusalem. And
   sorcery and magic increased, and divination and auguration and
   fornication and the persecution of the righteous at the hands of
   Manasseh... And when Isaiah the son of Amoz, saw the lawlessness which
   was being committed in Jerusalem, and the worship of Satan, and his
   triumph, he withdrew from Jerusalem, and settled in Bethlehem of
   Judea."

   The Papyrus goes on to speak of Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, as
   being "the teacher of the four hundred prophets of Baal;" and tells how
   Isaiah "called Jerusalem Sodom, and the rulers of Judah and Israel he
   named people of Gomorrah." This was of course in reference to the
   special sins of Sodom and Gomorrah. See Isa. i., &c.

   Many proofs abound to show that some similar system will yet be
   revived. None can be imagined which would more quickly and universally
   take hold upon the world, and unite all communities - and even the
   worst of characters, by making all, thus, to become religious, and yet
   able to degrade and gratify the instincts of human nature under the
   guise of religion.

   Nor can we conceive any form of corruption which would mark off the
   people of God more effectually, and cause them to be separated from the
   abounding wickedness around them.

   This is the best explanation which can be given of those solemn verses,
   Rev. ix. 20, 21: or rather, it is this passage which is itself the
   explanation of the awful character of Antichrist's great universal
   system of Religion, which even God's plagues, up to the point of time
   there referred to, will have failed to remove, and which will call down
   the yet greater judgments of "the seven vials."

   These verses (Rev. ix. 20, 21) are so weighty that we must them in
   full.

   "And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet
   repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship
   devils (R.V. marg. demons), and idols of gold, and silver, and brass,
   and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
   Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of
   their fornication, nor of their thefts."

   Our point, however, must not be forgotten, which is, to draw attention
   to the fact, that the mention of this evil in these Epistles
   corresponds with the historical order in Israel's history in the Old
   Testament.

  SARDIS

   We have had four references to Israel's history in the Old Testament,
   and as four is the number connected with the earth, so these four have
   been connected with Israel in the earth and the Land; and with the
   culminating sin of departure from the love of God manifested to the
   Nation. Israel had "left her first love," forsaken God, and joined
   herself to idols in the most abominable form.

   This is the climax of Israel's sin. All else in this history is
   judgment, until Israel is removed from the Land and taken away out of
   God's sight. His name is practically blotted out, never again to be a
   separate ten-tribed kingdom. So blotted out, in fact, that men speak
   today of the lost [48] ten tribes.

   Indeed, the prophecy of Deut. xxix. 20 is fulfilled, not only as to the
   individual and to the Tribe; but there is an application to the whole
   nation. In Deut. xxix. 18, 20 (17, 19) there is the threat to blot out
   the name of the "man" or "tribe" who shall introduce idolatry. As a
   matter of fact, the Tribes of Dan and Ephraim were the first to
   introduce it; and their names are blotted out from the tribes of those
   who are to be sealed in Rev. vii.

   It is in this Epistle, next in order (to the assembly at Sardis) that
   we have the reference to this silence, in the promise to the few names
   of such as have not defiled their garments: "He that overcometh... I
   will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess
   his name before my Father and before his Angels" (Rev. iii. 5).

  PHILADELPHIA

   We have had two references to Israel's history, and now we are to have
   two references to Judah's, and these refer, not any more to failure,
   sin and judgment; but to the hope of restoration and blessing.

   As Ahab, king of Israel, was the first to introduce and establish the
   Asherah worship, so the reference here, in the Epistle to the assembly
   of Philadelphia, is to Hezekiah, king of Judah, who did much to destroy
   it and cast it out.

   In 2 Chron. xxxi. 1, Hezekiah "brake in pieces the pillars (marg.
   obelisks), and hewed down the Asherim" (R.V.).

   His two predecessors, like himself, are described with special
   reference to their connection with the Temple and with the Temple
   worship. Indeed, these three kings of Judah are linked together as
   being three of the four reigns in which Isaiah prophesied, namely,
   "Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah" (Isa. i. 2).

   Jotham "entered not into the temple of the Lord" (2 Chron. xxvii. 2).

   Ahaz "shut up the doors of the house of the Lord" (2 Chron. xxviii.
   24).

   Hezekiah, at the beginning of his reign, "in the first year, in the
   first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord" (2 Chron. xxix.
   3).

   In Isa. xxii. 22 there is a further reference to this point. Shebna,
   the Treasurer, had misused his trust for his own glorification (see
   Isa. xxii. 15-19). On this account he was ordered to be deposed, by
   Divine command, and "the key of the house of David" was laid upon the
   shoulder of Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah (vers. 20-25): "And the key of
   the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so the shall open, and
   none shall shut, and he shall shut, and none shall open" (ver. 22).

   Eliakim means God will raise up: and there can be no doubt whatever
   that we have here a prophetic reference to Christ, whom God would raise
   up. Indeed, the whole passage (vers. 20-25) reads more like prophecy
   than history; and points very distinctly forward to the Temple which He
   Himself will build, and will fill with His glory.

   It is remarkable to notice how, in writing to this Assembly in
   Philadelphia (Rev. iii. 7), the Lord takes these very words and applies
   them to Himself, saying: "These things saith he... that hath the key of
   David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
   openeth."

   The reference here to Isa. xxii. 22 is unmistakable, and it is clear
   that we have a reference to another and subsequent, but closely
   connected, event in the Old Testament history.

   With this reference we can understand the announcement to the Assembly
   of Philadelphia in Rev. iii. 8: "Behold, I have set before thee an open
   door, and no man can shut it."

   And we can understand also the reference to the Temple in the promise,
   "I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no
   more out" (Rev. iii. 12).

   We are taken right on, beyond Jerusalem and its Temple, to the days of
   final blessing, even to the new Jerusalem and "the Temple of my God,"
   when Isa . lxii. 2 shall be fulfilled: "And the Gentiles shall see thy
   righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a
   new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name."

   When this is exactly what is promised in Rev. iii. 12, "I will write
   upon him my new name," it is difficult to understand how such a promise
   could ever have been diverted from Israel to the Church: taken away
   from what it is directly associated with; and applied to that with
   which it has no connection whatsoever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  LAODICEA

   We reach, in this last Epistle, the lowest point of Judah's
   degradation, in that long line of departure from God, from the day
   Israel left her "first love," even the day of her espousals, when
   brought forth out of Egypt, down, down through one vast scene of
   idolatry and judgment, until we find that nation described in the
   Epistle to the Assembly in Laodicea in a condition of spiritual
   destitution such as characterised the People in the period of the Minor
   Prophets.

   Indeed, so complete is the correspondence, that to see it we must wait
   till we take the Epistle sentence by sentence, and look at the passages
   from the Prophets, which we shall there place side by side. We give one
   or two as examples:

   Rev. iii. 17 - "Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with
   goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art
   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."

   Hos. ii. 5, 8, 9 - "For their mother hath played the harlot;... for she
   said, I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water, my
   wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink... For she did not know that I
   gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold,
   which they prepared for Baal. Therefore will I return, and take away my
   corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will
   recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness. And now will
   I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers," etc. etc.

   The whole of Hosea ii.-v., xii. 8, etc., must be read to see the
   pointed reference to this stage of Israel's condition. Compare also
   Hag. i. 6; Jer. xiii. 25, 26; v. 27; Zech. xi. 5, 13-18.

   Rev. iii. 18 - "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,
   that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not
   appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see."

   Compare with this Isa. lv. 1, 2; Hos. ii. 3; Jer. xiii. 25, 26; Isa.
   lix. 10; lxvi. 17; See also Mal. iii. 3

   Rev. iii. 19 - "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
   therefore, and repent."

   Isa. xliii. 4 - "Since thou was precious in my sight, thou hast been
   honourable, and I have loved thee." So Deut. vii. 8; Deut. viii. 5 -
   "Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his
   son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee." Mal. iii. 7 - "Return unto
   Me and I will return unto you" is another form of Rev. iii. 19.

   In verse 16, the Lord speaks of spueing out the angel. This is the very
   expression used prophetically in Lev. xviii. 25-28 of Israel; where
   Jehovah warns that, if they adopted the abominations of heathen
   idolatry, the Land might spue them out (compare Jer. ix. 19; Ezek.
   xxxvi. 13, 17).

   All this shows that the references in this last Epistle do not in any
   way fit the Church of God, but agree in every particular with Israel's
   history, and are referred to so as to enlighten them from their own
   past history, and thus warn them as to future evils which will then
   surround them.

   When the Church has been removed, and Israel is again dealt with, the
   religious condition of the nation will exactly correspond with its
   condition at the Lord's first coming.

   There will be, as there was then, plenty of religion. Isa. i. 10-15
   minutely describes the state of things, as they were then and will be
   again in the future.

   The truth of "this prophecy will be amply evidenced - "Thou sayest, I
   am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing."

   The Pharisee's prayer (Luke xviii. 11, 12) exemplifies it. The parables
   of the great supper, the wedding garment, etc., describe it. The people
   were blind. The answer to the question, "Are we also blind?" (John ix.
   40, 41) proves it.

   The call to the wedding feast will be, as then, individual. Matthew was
   called, Zacchaeus was called, and many others; and those who heard that
   call were unable to resist its commanding and enabling power.

   It is the great wedding feast of Rev. xix. 9 to which the parables
   pointed.

   These "servants," to whom this epistle is addressed, will understand
   the solemn warning, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock." "To the
   twelve tribes scattered abroad" it was announced "the judge standeth
   before the door" (Jas. v. 9).

   The then nearness of the Judge is the thought conveyed in this
   announcement. He will be then near at hand, and ready to be revealed.

   We are aware that the warning in chap. iii. 20, "Behold, I stand at the
   door, and knock," has been universally interpreted of the nearness of
   the Saviour in grace to those living in this present Church
   Dispensation, and this has been fostered by painters who have done so
   much to present perversions of Scripture to the eye.

   It is a perversion which just suits the old nature, for it puts man in
   the place of Almighty God, and turns the Lord Jesus into a helpless
   suppliant. All this is foreign to the doctrines of grace, and makes
   them all of none effect.

   Moreover, this popular interpretation is out of keeping with the
   context. For, all through these seven Epistles the Lord is in the
   character of a Judge, rewarding His "servants" according to their
   "works." To those looking for Him and ready to receive Him, He appears
   according to His promise in Luke xii. 35-40: "let your loins be girded
   about and your lights burning: and ye yourselves like unto men that
   wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he
   cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. Blessed are
   those servants, whom the lord, when he cometh, shall find watching:
   Verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself and make them to sit
   down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. And if he shall come
   in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so,
   blessed are those servants. And this know, that if the good-man of the
   house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched,
   and not have suffered his house to be broken through. Be ye therefore
   ready also: for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not."
   Here, we have the "Son of Man;" the "servants;" the illustration of the
   "thief;" the "watching;" the "knocking;" the "opening," and the
   "sitting down to meat." Surely we have in Rev. iii. 20, the fulfilment
   of this prophecy.

   How simple it all is when we look at this Epistle as relating to
   backsliding Israel, and read it in the light of the Prophets and the
   Gospels. How much more satisfactory to find these illustrations in the
   Old Testament Scriptures, instead of being occupied with the
   conflicting and fanciful references to certain phases of ecclesiastical
   history, which have no Scriptural foundation whatever, and rest
   entirely on human imagination. All is confusion as to interpretation,
   and error as to doctrine, the moment we introduce the Church or the
   present dispensation into these Epistles.

   We have seen enough in the consideration of this fourteenth point to
   furnish us with further evidence that the Church is not the subject of
   the Apocalypse.

   The same is seen when we look at our last point, viz., the order of the
   promises contained in these Epistles.

THE PROMISES TO THE SEVEN ASSEMBLIES.

   As we have seen that the references to the Old Testament in the seven
   Epistles correspond with the historical order of the events, so it is
   with respect to the promises contained in these Epistles. The literary
   order follows the historical order.

   They are written to a People supposed to be well-versed in the history
   of the Old Testament, and well-acquainted with all that had happened to
   their fathers and had been written for their admonition. Instructed in
   the past history of their nation, they will readily understand the
   relation between the testings and judgments in the past with which they
   are familiar, and those similar circumstances in which they will find
   themselves in a yet future day.

   While the historical events connected with the rebukes are carried down
   from Exodus to the period of the Minor Prophets, the promises cover a
   different period; commencing with the period of Eden, and ending with
   the period of Solomon.

   The subjects of the rebukes follow the order of the departure of the
   People from Jehovah. Their decline and apostasy is traced out in the
   historical references contained in these Epistles.

   All blessing depended on the national adherence of the chosen nation to
   the conditions of the Covenant made with them from the days of the
   Exodus to the days of the Minor Prophets.

   We see them, in the history, coming down, down, down; till we find them
   stripped of all blessing (nationally), poor, miserable and blind. All
   that seems to be hoped for, or looked for, among the People is a few
   individuals who will speak to one another and think upon the Coming One
   (Mal. iii. 16). Later, we see these in the persons of Zacharias and
   Elisabeth (Luke i. 5,6), Simeon (Luke ii. 25), and Anna (Luke ii.
   36-38), and others, "who were waiting for the consolation of Israel,"
   and looking "for redemption in Jerusalem." (Compare Mark xv. 43 and
   Luke xxiv. 21).

   We have seen that this same historical order is followed in these seven
   Epistles to the Assemblies.

   But when we turn to the PROMISES, then all is different. They proceed
   in the opposite direction. The order, instead of descending - from
   Israel's highest ground of privilege (Exodus) to the lowest stage of
   spiritual destitution (Minor Prophets) - ascends, in the counsels of
   Jehovah, from tending a garden to sharing His throne.

   This will be readily seen as we trace it out in the promises made in
   Rev. ii. and iii.

   But first we must note that they are all intensely individual. There is
   no corporate existence recognised as such. Each one of the seven
   promises commences with the same words, "to him that overcometh." This
   answers to the language of the Four Gospels, and the Epistle to the
   Hebrews: e.g., "He that endureth to the end," and resists all the flood
   of evil by which he will be surrounded, he shall be saved.

   Such phraseology is foreign to the language of the later Pauline Church
   Epistles.

   The whole period covered by "the day of the Lord" is called the final
   meeting of the ages, or the (...) (sunteleia); but, the crisis in which
   it culminates is called the (...) (telos), the end of the age.

   Both are rendered "end" in the New Testament, but the use of these two
   words must be carefully distinguished.

   Sunteleia denotes a finishing or ending together, or in conjunction
   with other things. Consummation is perhaps the best English rendering.
   [49] It implies that several things meet together, and reach their end
   during the same period; whereas telos is the point of time at the end
   of that period. [50] For example, in Matt. xxiv. 3 the disciples ask,
   "What shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the sunteleia of the
   age."

   In His answer to this question the Lord speaks of the whole period, and
   covers the whole of the sunteleia. But three times He mentions the
   telos (1) to say that "the telos is not yet" (verse 6); (2) to give a
   promise to him "that shall endure unto the telos" (verse 13); (3) to
   mark the crisis in verse 14, which comes immediately after the close of
   the preaching of "the gospel of the kingdom." "Then shall the telos
   come." The sign of the telos is the setting up of "the abomination of
   desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet." Thus the telos, and he who
   endures to this, the same shall be saved, and will be among the
   overcomers specially referred to in these seven Epistles; to whom these
   promises are made, and to whom they peculiarly refer.

   They are seven in number, as we know: but we have to note that the
   seven here, as elsewhere, is divided into three and four.

   Each Epistle ends with two things: (1) an injunction to "hear;" (2) a
   promise to him that "overcometh." In the first three Epistles the
   Promise comes after the Injunction. In the last four it comes before
   it.

   This is because the first three are connected, by reference, to what is
   written of the Divine provisions in the books of Genesis and Exodus
   (the Garden and the Wilderness); while the latter four are connected
   with the Land and the thrones of David and Solomon: the number three
   marking Heavenly or Divine perfection; and the number four having to do
   with the earth.

   Let us look at these Promises in order.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIRST

   refers to Genesis ii., the promise being, "I will give to eat of the
   tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God" (Rev. ii.
   7).

   God begins from Himself. The Apocalypse related not only to Israel, but
   to the earth; and the first promise goes back to Eden and to the "tree
   of life."

   The way to that tree was lost: but was "kept" (or preserved) by the
   cherubim (Gen. iii. 24). These cherubim next appear in connection with
   the way to the Living One, in the Tabernacle, and are thus linked on to
   Israel.

   Only in Israel's restoration can the way to the "Tree of Life" be
   restored.

   Sovereignty and government on the earth is the great subject of the
   Apocalypse; therefore the promise goes back to the point where
   sovereignty was ignored and government was overthrown. This becomes the
   starting-point. That is why the cherubim reappear in the Apocalypse,
   intimately associated with this work of restoration of Divine
   Government on the earth. their song is of "creation" (Rev. iv. 11).
   Their likeness is to creation. Their song is of the redemption of
   Israel (not their own. See the notes on them in chap. iv. and v.).
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SECOND

   refers to Genesis iii., the promise being "Be thou faithful unto death,
   and I will give thee the crown of life." "He that overcometh shall not
   be hurt of the second death" (ii. 10, 11). The reference is to Genesis
   iii., where death first enters. But the promise goes beyond this; for
   it relates not merely to the death which came in with sin, but to the
   "second death," which is revealed in Rev. xx. 14; xxi. 8.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE THIRD

   refers to Exodus. The promise is, "I will give to eat of the hidden
   manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name
   written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it" (ii. 17).

   It is in this third Epistle, which refers to the wilderness period and
   Balaam's counsel, that we have a special reference to the manna, the
   wilderness sustenance, of which Exodus contains the record. "Bread from
   Heaven" and "Angels' food" (Ps. lxxviii. 24,25) are set over against
   the lusts of the flesh and spiritual idolatry. The manna was to be
   "hidden" in the Ark of the Covenant, "that they may see the bread
   wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
   from the land of Egypt... so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to
   be kept" (Ex. xvi. 32-34). This "hidden" food is for remembrance; to
   remind them that God can supply the remnant of His People in the coming
   day, when none shall be allowed to buy or sell (Rev. xiii. 16,17), and
   therefore to buy food to eat, unless they consent to bear the "mark of
   the Beast."

   God supported His People in the wilderness, where they could obtain no
   food: Why not here? The false prophets will eat to the full at the
   table of another Jezebel: Why should not God "furnish a table" (Psa.
   lxxviii. 19) for His own in that coming day, in that wilderness whither
   they will flee (Rev. xii. 14)? The one was literal: why not the other?
   Why go out of our way to seek for a strange interpretation alien to the
   subject, when we have one ready to hand in the Old Testament Scriptures
   which are being referred to? That manna was to be "hidden," and "kept,"
   to remind them that God can still, and will again "furnish a table in
   the wilderness," that they may again be "nourished for a time, and
   times, and half a time" (Rev. xii. 14).

   There is a further promise as to the "white stone" and the "new name."
   Again we ask, Why go to our own imaginations, or to Pagan customs, for
   interpretations, when we have in this same book of Exodus [51] the
   account of the stones on which the names of the Tribes were engraven:
   Two on the High Priest's shoulder, with six names on each (collective);
   and twelve on the breastplate, with one name on each (individual). The
   individual names being placed "upon his heart" (the place of love), and
   the collective names "upon his shoulders" (the place of strength)
   (Exod. xxviii. 8-30).

   Besides these stones there were the stones of the "Urim and Thummin,"
   of which little or nothing is known. These may have "white" for aught
   we know; but we do know that they were associated with a hearing and
   answering God dwelling in the midst of His People.

   Here, amid their scenes of trial and tribulation, when God's people
   will find themselves in another wilderness, they are reminded, by this
   Exodus-promise, of Jehovah's presence with them; and of the blessed
   fact that He has their names in remembrance; that His love is
   everlasting; that His strength is almighty, and able to nourish them
   when their enemies might prevail and human resources fail.

  THE FOURTH

   refers to the books of Numbers and Samuel. The promise is, "to him will
   give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron;
   as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I
   received of my Father. And I will give him the morning star" (Rev. ii.
   26-28).

   Here again the literary order in the Apocalypse goes forward with the
   historical order: for it is in the book of Numbers that we have the
   basis of this promise given to the same People, who were the subjects
   of it there. For "there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
   shall rise out of Israel, and shall mite the corners (marg. princes) of
   Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. And Edom shall be a
   possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel
   shall do valiantly. Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have
   dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city" (Numbers
   xxiv. 17-19).

   This promise and prophecy had a first foreshadowing fulfilment in
   David; showing what was in store for David's Son and David's Lord: even
   for Him who was the "root and the offspring of David."

   Luke i. 31-33 tells of His conquest, and of His reign on David's
   throne.

   David, we have said, foreshadowed it: for he could say in the words of
   his song, "thou hast girded me with strength to battle; them that rose
   up against me hast thou subdued under me. Thou hast also given me the
   necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.... Then
   did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as
   the mire of the street" (2 Sam. xxii. 40,41,43).

   This was the theme of David's song "in the day that the Lord had
   delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies."

   And this heralds the yet more glorious song in honour of David's Lord
   when the kingdoms of the world shall have become the kingdom of our
   Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever (Rev. xi.
   15).

   The promise is given in this fourth Epistle, because the prophecy of
   Numbers xxiv. 17-19 has never yet been really fulfilled. "The
   day-spring (the morning star) did visit His people" (Luke i. 78); but
   He was rejected; and therefore the fulfilment remains in abeyance, as
   well as that of Luke i. 31-33.

   In Rev. ii. 26-28 the time is at hand for the fulfilment of it. Hence
   the promise is repeated; and in chap. xx. 4 we see it accomplished; for
   the "morning star" shall then have risen (Rev. xxii. 16), and the
   prophecy of Psalm ii. shall be fulfilled.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIFTH

   refers again to the times of David -- not the beginning of his reign,
   but to the end of it.

   It is a double promise, negative and positive, and both have to do with
   the names of individuals.

   "I will not blot out his name out of the book of life; but I will
   confess his name before my Father, and before his angels" (iii. 5).

   The reference is to "the last words of David" in 2 Sam. xxiii. They
   follow "the words of this song" in the previous chapter.

   These "last words of David" were uttered as he was about to give up the
   throne and the kingdom to Solomon; when the conflict was to end, and
   issue in dominion, and in a glorious reign of peace: foreshadowing the
   time when this promise of Rev. iii. 5 is about to be fulfilled, and the
   Apocalyptic judgments are about to issue in millennial glories.

   "I will not blot out his name."

   "I will confess his name."

   So runs the double promise, and it is exactly what we see in the
   history which is thus referred to.

   David is confessing the names of his overcomers, and the confessing of
   them begins, "These be the names of the mighty men whom David had" (2
   Sam.xxiii. 8).

   They had "gathered themselves to him" in the day of his rejection. For,
   though he had been anointed as king, he was not as yet sitting on his
   own throne, but was in the cave Adullam, or the place of testimony.
   [52]

   They had gone to him in their distress and debt and bitterness of soul
   (I Sam. xxii. 1,2), and David "became a captain over them." They had
   followed him through all his conflicts: and now, on the eve of the era
   of glory and peace, their names are confessed before all.

   Their deeds are announced, and their exploits are recorded. But there
   are some who are "blotted out."

   Joab is not there, though "Abishai, the brother of Joab," is there (2
   Sam. xxiii. 18); "Asahel, the brother of Joab," is there (verse 24);
   "Nahari...armour-bearer to Joab," is there (verse 37); but not Joab
   himself. He was a "mighty man." He had been the commander-in-chief of
   David's forces, a valiant soldier, a great statesman and wise
   counsellor; but, while he was all this and more, he was not an
   overcomer, for his heart was not right with David. He remained loyal
   when Absalom rebelled; but he took part in the treason of Adonijah.

   Ahithophel is not there; though we read of "Eliam the son of
   Ahithophel" (verse 34). He was David's greatest counsellor; so wise,
   that when he spoke "it was as if a man had enquired at the oracle (or
   word) of God" (2 Sam. xvi. 23). But he was not an overcomer, and he is
   not "confessed" even before men. He took sides with Absalom in his
   rebellion; and he is blotted out from this list of names.

   Abiathar, too, is blotted out, for not even is his name here. He was
   David's beloved friend (see 1 Sam. xxii. 20-23), but he was not an
   overcomer. He remained loyal in the treason of Absalom, but joined in
   that of Adonijah.

   The other names are duly confessed.

   The scene is unspeakably solemn; and has, by application, a warning
   voice for all. But, by interpretation, it comes with special force in
   this promise to the Assembly at Sardis, and refers to the fulfilment of
   Matt. x. 32, 33 and Luke xii. 8, 9. "Whosoever therefore shall confess
   me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
   heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
   before my Father which is in heaven." Thus this promise refers not only
   to that solemn past scene in Israel's history, but is shown to be
   closely connected with the Four Gospels, and points on to the scenes of
   final judgment and glory in connection with David's Lord, and "a
   greater than Solomon."

   [52] Adullam means their testimony.

  THE SIXTH

   refers to Solomon, as does the seventh (Laodicea). In the former the
   reference is to the "Temple" and to the "City;" while, in the latter,
   it is to the "Throne."

   The promise runs (iii. 12), "Him that overcometh will I make a pillar
   in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write
   upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which
   is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and my
   new name."

   The reference here to Solomon is unmistakable.

   He it was who built the temple, and put in its porch those mysterious
   pillars "Jachin and Boaz" (1 Kings vii. 13-22; 2 Chron. iii. 17).

   "And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up
   the fight pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin (i.e., He shall
   establish): and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
   Boaz (i.e., In it is strength)."

   Strength and permanence were thus announced to all who entered that
   wondrous Temple.

   The Temple of God is brought in this Epistle into contrast with the
   Synagogue of Satan, and those were of the latter who "say they are Jews
   and are not." That synagogue has neither strength nor permanence. But
   the overcomers are endued with Divine strength, and shall have eternal
   inheritance, for they "shall go no more out."

   Moreover, the promise refers to the name of the overcomer being written
   in "the city of my God."

   There can be only one interpretation to this promise. Anyone acquainted
   with Old Testament phraseology will at once go back in memory to such
   Psalms as xlviii., cxxii., and lxxxvii. In this latter we read:

   "Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised:
   In the City of our God -- His holy mount.
   Beautiful for situation, The joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion,
   The sides of the north, the city of the great king.

   As we have heard, so have we seen;
   In the city of the Lord of hosts,
   In the city of our God: God will establish it for ever" (Psa. xlviii.
   1, 2, 8)

   "His foundation is in the holy mountains.
   Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion
   More than all the dwellings of Jacob.
   Glorious things are spoken of thee,
   O city of God. Selah.
   I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
   Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia,
   This one was born there.

   And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her.
   And He, the Most High, shall establish her.
   Jehovah shall count, when he writeth up the peoples
   'This man was born there.' Selah.
   As well the singers, as the players on instruments [shall say]
   'All my springs are in thee'" (Psa. lxxxvii.).

   True, the chapter-headings of the A.V. may call this "the nature and
   glory of the Church." But we shall prefer to believe God in so plain
   and literal a description of "the city of God:" and those who are the
   subjects of the promise will have a blessed knowledge of what it will
   mean to be written "in the city of my God."

   Ezekiel (chap. xiii.) also addresses Israel; but as he speaks not of
   promises and blessings, it is not interpreted of the Church, but it is
   left for the persons mentioned; though they are not more clearly
   defined here than in the above Psalm. In verse 9 we read of those who
   "shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be
   written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter
   into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Adonai Jehovah"
   (Ezek. xiii. 9).

   The promise in Rev. iii. 12 refers to the New Jerusalem (chap. xxi. and
   xxii.). If the city of David and Solomon was such that "glorious
   things" were spoken of it as "the city of God," what will be the
   glories of that city which "cometh down out of heaven from my God"? And
   what will be the blessing of Zion and Jerusalem when, as written in
   Isa. lxii. 1, "the righteousness thereof shall go forth as brightness
   and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth"? Then it is that the
   promise is given, "Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth
   of the Lord shall name." (Compare Isa. lx 14). In Isa. lxii. 4 and 12
   we have further instruction as to this "new name" referred to in Rev.
   iii. 12.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SEVENTH

   refers to the throne, of which Solomon's was in every respect the ideal
   type.

   This, the highest promise, is given to the overcomers in the lowest
   condition of Israel's degradation, which is described as in danger of
   being "spued out."

   What that was we have already seen (page 89), and now we have the
   chiefest of all the promises. The overcomers in that last terrible
   condition of things are the ones who most need the greatest of Divine
   help and encouragement. Hence the highest promise is given.

   "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even
   as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne" (Rev.
   iii. 21).

   To Solomon is the great promise of the throne vouchsafed through David.
   "When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I
   will set up thy seed after thee... and I will establish his kingdom. He
   shall build me an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of
   his kingdom for ever" ( 2 Sam. vii. 12, 13).

   The defection of those who should follow Solomon on that throne was
   foreknown and provided for. The whole of Psalm lxxxix. should be read
   in this connection, as explaining how and why the throne should come to
   be in abeyance. After referring to this in verse 14, the promise goes
   on: Yet

   "My mercy shall not depart away from him...
   "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before
   thee:
   "Thy throne shall be established for ever" (2 Sam. vii. 15, 16).

   How and when this promise will be fulfilled, after the period of
   chastening referred to in verse 14 (of 2 Sam. vii.) shall have ended,
   is described in Dan. vii. There we have fully set forth how "the Son of
   Man" shall receive the kingdom and the throne, and how "the saints of
   the Most High" shall share that throne with Him, as promised in this
   Epistle.

   The title used in Dan. vii., "The Most High" is very significant, and
   shows that the whole scene relates to the earth. Whenever this title is
   used this is its meaning and teaching. Its first occurrence, in Gen.
   xiv. 18-24 marks it as belonging to the "possessor of heaven and
   earth." It was as "the Most High" that He divided to the nations "their
   inheritance" in the earth (Deut. xxxii. 8), which, as its "possessor,"
   He alone had the right or the power to do. In Psa. lxxxiii. 18 He is
   called "the Most High over all the earth." And so it is in all the
   thirty-six occurrences of the title in the Old Testament.

   The expression, "the saints of the Most High," tells us that the people
   referred to are an earthly people, even those whose promise is an
   earthly throne and an earthly kingdom. Not the church of God,
   therefore, whose calling, standing, hope and destiny are heavenly.

   Four times is the expression used in Dan. vii. In verse 18 "the saints
   of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for
   ever, even for ever and ever."

   In verses 21, 22 the fourth Beast "made war with the saints and
   prevailed against them (as related in Rev. xiii. 7); until the Ancient
   of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High;
   and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."

   In verse 25 the Beast "shall speak great words against the Most High,"
   &c. (as related also in 2 Thess. ii. 4, and Rev. xiii. 5, 6).

   In verse 27 we read that "the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness
   of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of
   the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
   and all dominions shall serve and obey him."

   These are the "elect," who shall be "gathered together from the four
   winds, from one end of the heaven to the other," when the "Son of Man"
   shall come down on the earth (Matt. xxiv. 30, 31). Then shall His
   "call" go forth, "Gather my saints together unto me." This is when He
   will call "to the earth, that He may judge His People" (Psa. l. 4, 5;
   read the whole Psalm).

   And when, later, in Matt. xxv. 31, we read, "When the Son of man shall
   come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit
   upon the throne of his glory": then there will be a different
   gathering, not of His "elect" (see Matt. xxiv. 31), but "before him
   shall be gathered all nations," [53] according to Joel iii. 1, 2 and
   11, 12.

   This throne of the special judgment of the "nations" leads up to and
   ends in the permanent throne of Divine government, according to Jer.
   iii. 17.

   Then will this promise be fulfilled to the overcomer: "I will grant to
   sit with Me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with
   my Father in His throne (Rev. iii. 21).

   This promise, therefore, like all the others is not given to the Church
   of God. The members of that glorious body will have already been
   'caught up to meet the Lord in the air," and will have had their part
   in the "gathering together unto him" there, before the cry of Psa. l. 5
   goes forth to "the earth, that he may judge his people," and "gather
   his (earthly) saints together."

   Thus we have traced the upward path -- the ascending scale of the seven
   promises of these seven Epistles, and seen how are they to be
   interpreted of Israel, whose downward path is here also so wonderfully
   set forth in these same Epistles.

   This concludes our fifteen preliminary points; and we submit that their
   cumulative evidence establishes our fundamental position that, the
   "Church of God" does not form the subject of the Apocalypse. Our
   interpretation confines that subject to the "Jew" and the "Gentile" (I
   Cor. x. 32). Whether "the word of truth" is thus "rightly" divided is
   for our readers to determine for themselves, according to the evidence
   which we shall put before them.

          THE SCOPE OF THE APOCALYPSE SHEWN BY ITS PLACE IN THE CANON

   The scope of the Apocalypse is the most important of all the
   preliminary subjects connected with its interpretation. Apart from its
   true scope, no correct interpretation is possible. This scope is best
   gathered from its structure; but, before considering this, we propose
   to look at it as shown by its place in the Canon of Scripture, and by
   the relation in which it stands to the other books of the New
   Testament. This is the first thing that must be discovered in order to
   get an insight as to its place, subject, object and scope.

   The order of the books of the New Testament as a whole varies, both in
   the manuscripts, versions and catalogues [54] which have been preserved
   and have come down to us.

   But while the order of the separate books may vary, they are always
   arranged in four groups which never vary: -- (1) The Four Gospels. (2)
   The Acts of the Apostles. (3) The Epistles. (4) The Apocalypse.

   The four groups always follow each other in this order. We say four
   "groups"; but it will be observed that only the first and third groups;
   the second and fourth consist of only one single book each.

   The order of the separate books in these two groups varies. For
   example, the order of the Gospels varies. The order of the Epistles
   varies, for in some lists Paul's Epistles come before the general and
   other Epistles, and vice versa. But, like Paul's Epistles addressed to
   churches, which never vary in their order, so thee four groups never
   vary in their order.

   Their inter-relation may be set forth, in brief, in the following
   structure:--

   The New Testament Books

   Gospels

   | THE FIRST ADVENT. The coming of the "Son of Man" to present the
   kingdom. The rejection of the kingdom and crucifixion of the King.

   The Acts and the Earlier Pauline Epistles

   | H | THE KINGDOM RE-OFFERED. The Acts and earlier Pauline Epistles
   (Acts iii. 19, 20). The "Signs and Wonders of the Holy Ghost (Heb. ii.
   3, 4). The offer rejected (Acts xxviii. 25, 26).

   The Later Pauline Epistles

   | H | THE KINGDOM IN ABEYANCE. The "Not Yet" of Heb. ii. 8. The Mystery
   revealed and consummated, Rom. xvi. 25, 26; Eph. iii. 1-4; Col. i. 5 -
   ii. 3; 1 Tim. iii. 16; Phil. iii. 14.

   Apocalypse

   | THE SECOND ADVENT. The coming of the "Son of Man" to set up the
   kingdom in power and great glory. The establishing of the kingdom and
   the crowning of the King.

   From this structure it will be seen that the Apocalypse stands out in
   special relation to, and connection with the four Gospels, and not with
   the Epistles.

   The Gospels record the events connected with the First Advent, and the
   Apocalypse records the events connected with the Second Advent.

   In the Gospels we have "the days of the Son of Man" (Luke xvii. 22); in
   the Apocalypse we have "the day of the Lord" (i. 10).

   The Gospels close with the great prophecy of "the Son of man in the
   clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matt. xxiv. 30, xxvi. 64;
   Mark xiii. 36; Luke xxi. 27); followed by the account of His
   sufferings, piercing and death.

   The Apocalypse takes up this theme and opens by declaring the
   fulfilment of this prophecy, "Behold he cometh with clouds; and every
   eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him" (i. 7): followed by
   the account of the judgments; the coming and the crowning.

   The Gospels contain the prophecy of the Great Tribulation: the
   Apocalypse contains the description of it.

   Between the first advent, which is the subject of the Gospels, and the
   second advent, which is the subject of the Apocalypse, we have the
   present interval, which is the subject of the Acts of the Apostles and
   the Epistles.

   This interval is thus divided into two distinct periods, (1) that
   covered by the Acts of the Apostles and earlier Pauline Epistles, and
   (2) that covered by the later Pauline Epistles.

   The Acts has for its subject the re-presentation of the King and the
   kingdom. Israel is again taken up, and Peter, using the keys of the
   kingdom committed to him for this special purpose, opens the kingdom to
   Jews and Gentiles. Through the abounding grace of God the kingdom is
   again offered to Israel, but this being rejected the cup of Israel's
   iniquity is filled up. The people not only rejected Christ Risen, but
   they resisted the Holy Ghost. They resisted Jehovah in the Old
   Testament, The Messiah in the Gospels, and the Holy Ghost in the Acts.
   Though the ministry of Peter partly overlaps that of Paul, yet it is
   clear that Israel is specially dealt with as such, until the final
   sentence is pronounced in Acts xxviii. 17-28, which was speedily
   followed by the taking of the People out of their city and their Land.

   Then we have the period covered by the later Pauline Epistles, which
   have for their subject the Mystery, or the Church of God.

   The church has a different calling, a different standing, and a
   different destiny from either Jew or Gentile, and yet, composed of
   both, is now waiting for their calling on high (Phi. iii. 14).

   It may be that these two parts of the present interval slightly
   overlap, as Paul's ministry in the synagogues and among the Gentiles
   also overlapped.

   Not until shortly after the Apostle's death did God actually (as He had
   already begun to do judicially) cause to deal with Israel as Israel,
   scattering the People abroad on the earth -- destroying the Temple, and
   effectually, for a time, breaking off the natural branches from the
   Olive Tree (Rom. xi.).

   After this, we have set before us, in the Epistles, the calling and
   hope of the church, which is now being taken out, and is waiting to be
   taken up, to meet the Lord in the air; waiting for "our gathering
   together unto Him" (1 Thess. i. 10; iv. 15 - v. 4; 2 Thess. ii. 1-3
   R.V.), before "the Day of the Lord" shall come.

   This is fundamental to our whole position, and is necessary, we
   believe, to a clearer understanding of the Apocalypse.

   It is well therefore that we should further establish the great scope
   of the Book as taught us by its position in the New Testament; and its
   special relation to the Gospels.

   In 1 Thess. v. 4, we are distinctly told "ye, brethren, are not in
   darkness, that that day ('the day of the Lord,' verse 2) should
   overtake you as a thief."

   As the Revelation is the description of that day (i. 10, iii. 3; xvi.
   15) and of His "coming as a thief" (compare Matt. xxiv. 43, 44), it is
   clear that the promise of 1 Thess. v. 4, must be fulfilled before the
   Lord Jesus is thus revealed. Those concerned will be already at "rest,"
   with Him "when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with His
   mighty angels; in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
   God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall
   be punished with everlasting destruction, [driven away] from the
   presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power, when HE SHALL
   HAVE COME to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them
   that believe ... in that day" (2 Thess i. 7-10).

   The tense here (in verse 10) is not the simple future tense of the
   indicative mood, but it is the second aorist tense of the subjunctive
   mood, (...) (elthe), and can mean only shall have come. In verse 7,
   "when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed" is not a verb at all, but a
   noun, (...) (en te apokalupsei), and means at the revelation (lit., at
   the Apocalypse).

   So that "at the Apocalypse" of Jesus Christ, the Raptured ones of 1
   Thess. iv. will already be at rest. They have their "tribulation" now
   (vers. 4, 5). This is the teaching of v. 7.

   But when the time comes to "recompense tribulation" to the world, then
   Christ will already have come to be glorified in His saints. For "in
   that day" He "shall have come" to take them up to be with Himself, "for
   ever with the Lord." This is the teaching of verse 10.

   That this is the only sense in which this tense can be taken is clear
   from the following examples of its use :-- Matt. xxi. 40: "When the
   lord of the vineyard cometh" (shall have come).

   Luke xvii. 10: "So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those
   things." (Here it is so rendered).

   Mark viii. 38: "Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me... of him
   also shall the Son of Man be ashamed (here we have the simple future)
   when he cometh (...) (hotan elthe, the same as in 2 Thess. i. 10, i.e.,
   shall have come) in the glory of his Father."

   In John iv. 25 we have the tense contrasted with another: "I know that
   Messiah cometh (lit., is coming), which is called Christ; when He is
   come ((...) shall have come) he will tell us all things."

   Acts xxiii. 35: "I will hear thee, said he, when (...) thine accusers
   are also come" (lit., when thine accusers also shall have come).

   John xvi. 13: "Howbeit, when He, the Spirit of truth, is come" ((...)
   shall have come).

   Rom. xi. 27: "For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
   (lit., shall have taken away) their sins."

   The prophecy as to Christ's enemies' being put under His feet (Psa. cx.
   1) is quoted or referred to six times in the New Testament. Christ is
   now at God's right hand "until His enemies shall have been placed (as)
   a footstool for His feet." (See Matt. xxii. 44; Mark xii. 36: Luke xx.
   42; Acts ii. 34; Heb. i. 13; x. 12, 13). Then He will arise and use
   this footstool, treading His enemies under His feet (Psa. xviii.
   37-50). This is the subject of the Apocalypse; and result and
   fulfilment of it is recorded in 1 Cor. xv. 25, which speaks of Christ's
   after-reign, "For He must reign till He hath put (lit., shall have put)
   all enemies under His feet." So that the two acts are carefully
   distinguished. First, the placing of the footstool; and then the using
   of it. The one is at the beginning of the "day of the Lord," the other
   is at the end of His reign.

   All this is conclusive, and tells us that the church of God will be at
   "rest" at the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ. And that, when He comes to
   take vengeance on His enemies, He "shall have come" already for His
   saints.

   This enables us to see the true place of the Apocalypse in the New
   Testament. Chronologically it follows on the Epistles, which end with
   the taking up of (1 Thess. iv.); but logically, i.e., in the purpose of
   the ages (Eph. iii. 10 R.V. marg.), it follows the Gospels; and takes
   up the subject of the King and the Kingdom, where it is there left.

   There we see it rejected: here we see it established with judgment, and
   set up in Divine power and glory.

   True, in order of time it follows on the period covered by the
   Epistles: and what we have to look for, now, is, not the conversion of
   the world, but the judgment of the world. The professing church is
   deceiving the world. It tells the world that its mission is to improve
   the world and, by improving its sanitation, housing its poor, and
   generally preaching the gospel of earthly citizenship, to bring on a
   millennium, in which no Christ is thought of or wanted!

   While the majority of the Church's teachers are loudly proclaiming that
   "the day of the Lord" will not come till the world's conversion comes,
   the Spirit and truth of God are declaring that that day shall not come
   until the apostasy comes (2 Thess. ii. 3).

   While the majority of the Church's teachers are maintaining that the
   world is not yet good enough for Christ, the Spirit is declaring in the
   Word that the world is not yet bad enough.

   There is some difference between these two testimonies; and our labour
   will not be in vain, if we learn from this book of the Revelation to
   believe God; and, while we "wait for His son from heaven" as our
   blessed Hope, to warn the world of increasing apostasy (which may go on
   side by side with increasing morality) and of coming judgment.

   Yes, coming judgment. That is the scope of the whole book. We have,
   here, events which cannot be limited by mere ecclesiastical history;
   but a wondrous unveiling of the awful scenes which shall end up God's
   controversy with Satan. It has as its field the whole creation, and not
   merely a corrupt church in Europe. All the forces of Heaven and Hell
   are seen in conflict, and bringing to a head the mighty issues
   involved.

   On the one side we see,

   (1) The full display of the power of God in Christ, opposed to the full
   energy of Satan and all his forces in the "day of battle and of war"
   (Job xxxviii. 23).

   (2) In this final conflict, we see the full array of all the Heavenly
   forces which Christ can command and will command. We see spiritual
   beings, angels and principalities and powers in Heaven, and the great
   physical forces of creation (Zech. xii. 4-8; xiv. 1-4, etc., etc.,)
   brought to bear on the great enemy.

   (3) That mighty heavenly host will embrace all who have been delivered
   and redeemed from "the power of Satan" from the time of sin's
   beginning, as well as all the angelic beings who have not fallen.

   (4) These heavenly forces are led by "the King of Kings, and Lord of
   Lords," -- "the Prince of the Kings of the earth" -- the great "Captain
   of the Lord's host."

   On the other side, we see

   (1) The full display of Satan's power and authority (xvi. 13, 14), and
   that, too, from the beginning of his tyranny and usurpation as the
   "prince of this world" and its "god" (John xii. 31; xvi. 11; 2 Cor. iv.
   4).

   (2) To this end, all the hosts which he can and will command, from the
   very beginning of his power -- angels and principalities and powers;
   men and demons from the pit, and men on earth; all these will be led by
   their captain, and all brought to bear against Him who sitteth upon the
   White Horse (Rev. xix.; Jude 6; 2 Pet. ii. 4).

   (3) This mighty host will be of far wider extent than the minds of
   expositors have ever yet conceived.

   (4) These forces of earth and hell will have for their leader, Satan,
   "the prince of this world."

   We have here something far beyond the ordinary interpretations put upon
   this Book: and, we believe that few, if any, can possibly realize all
   the mighty issues involved in it: and the extent of its results as
   affecting creation, Israel, and the nations of the world.

   To limit it to Popery, or to Christendom (so called) is, we believe,
   wholly to miss the scope of the Book: and, to lose the weighty lessons
   if its wondrous Revelation, by committing the mistake condemned by true
   logic -- viz., of putting a part (and a small part too) for the whole.

   The awful conflict is of far wider extent than this. It exceeds all the
   general petty views of its scope; as affairs of State transcend those
   of a Parish Vestry.

   "Michael and his angels" and "the Dragon and his angels" include the
   whole fighting forces of the heavens. Rev. xii. reveals the HEAVENLY
   ARMAGEDDON, which will bring to an end the hostilities of ages by a
   final overthrow of the wicked (so far as the super-etherial heavens are
   concerned).

   What the Book tells us of the conflict on earth is of the same
   character. The scope of it takes in the whole earth, and leads up also
   to an EARTHLY ARMAGEDDON (Rev. xvi. 16).

   The Covenant of marvels (Ex. xxxiv. 10) refers to judgments which are
   cosmical in the widest sense of the term.

   The scope of the book winds up all the affairs of time, and contains
   the end of prophecy, the end of knowledge, and the end of the Secret of
   God (x. 7), and the dawn of the eternal ages of ages.

   In short, the scope of the book, as shown by its place in, and relation
   to, the whole canon of Scripture, is the winding up of the affairs of
   the whole creation, and the fixing of the eternal states of all things
   in heaven and on earth.

   We are thankful to feel that we are not alone in taking this serious
   view of the real scope of the Apocalypse.

   While many fritter away its solemn scenes in the common-place history
   of Europe, there are others who see beyond all this, and behold the
   Divine interposition in the affairs of the whole creation.

   We have information about the church in the Epistles: as we see, even
   in them, the indications of the coming corruption which has since
   become history. But in the Apocalypse we have something far beyond, and
   quite different from all this.

   The Epistles prepare us for what we know as Ecclesiastical history; and
   they prepare us also for the end and revealed in the Apocalypse.

   Eloquent testimony is borne to this, and therefore to our view of the
   scope of Revelation, by Canon Bernard; [55] who approaches the subject
   from a somewhat different standpoint.

   His weighty words are:--

   "I know not how any man, in closing the Epistles, could expect to find
   the subsequent history of the Church essentially different from what it
   is. In those writings we seem, as it were, not to witness some passing
   storms which clear the air, but to feel the whole atmosphere charged
   with the elements of future tempest and death. Every moment the forces
   of evil show themselves more plainly. They are encountered, but not
   dissipated. Or, to change the figure, we see battles fought by leaders
   of our band, but no security is promised by their victories. New
   assaults are being prepared; new tactics will be tried; new enemies
   pour on; the distant hills are black with gathering multitudes, and the
   last exhortations of those who fall at their posts call on their
   successors to 'endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ,' [56]
   and 'earnestly to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the
   saints.' [57]

   "The fact which I observe is not merely that these indications of the
   future are in the Epistles, but that they increase as we approach the
   close, and after the doctrines of the Gospel have been fully wrought
   out, and the fullness of personal salvation and the ideal character of
   the church have been placed in the clearest light, the shadows gather
   and deepen on the external history. The last words of St. Paul in the
   second Epistle to Timothy, and those of St. Peter in his second
   Epistle, with the Epistles of St. John and St. Jude, breathe the
   language of a time in which the tendencies of that history had
   distinctly shewn themselves; and in this respect these writings form a
   prelude and a passage to the Apocalypse."

   If these things be so, as we assuredly believe they are, then the
   church is not the subject of the Apocalypse.

   The Apocalypse follows the Epistles in sequence of time, and is
   naturally and historically consequent upon them; but in the Divine
   order and plan it is logically and dispensationally consequent on the
   Gospels and Acts.

   Every previous dispensation has ended in judgment, from Satan's first
   rebellion (Gen. i. 1, 2) to his final rebellion (Rev. xx. 8-10) and the
   final judgment (verses 11-15).

   That this present dispensation shall end in judgment is not only to be
   inferred from the uniform history of the past; for it is clearly
   foretold in the Epistles. It is this judgment which is described in the
   Apocalypse; and it is this book we are now seeking to understand more
   clearly. This clearness, we believe, will be greater in proportion as
   we see the position occupied by this Book in the New Testament; and in
   proportion as we believe that the Church of God has no part in the
   great Tribulation, and no participation in those judgments.

   That it is not the subject of this book we have endeavoured to
   establish in our fifteen preliminary points: and this view will be
   further confirmed as we proceed with our consideration and study of the
   Apocalypse.

               THE SCOPE OF THE APOCALYPSE SHEWN BY ITS STRUCTURE

   Having seen the scope of the Apocalypse as suggested by the place of
   the book in the Canon of Scripture, we now propose to gather its scope
   from its structure.

   This can be done only by looking at the book as a whole.

   Most expositions of the book have proceeded on some plan formed
   according to the expositor's own idea. These are, for the most part,
   clever and ingenious; but, after all, they represent only the opinion
   of each individual writer; and are accepted or rejected according to
   the opinion of each individual reader. The fact that there are scarcely
   two alike out of the vast number of these analyses shows what a poor
   foundation these human opinions are to rest upon; and also that there
   is room for a serious attempt to search and see whether there be not
   some Divine plan in the structure of the book; or whether God has left
   us thus at sea, without chart, compass or helm.

   Our answer is that God has not thus left us to interpret the book; but
   He has given us the book as His own interpretation of what "The Day of
   the Lord" is to be. There is a Divine plan in the structure of the
   book; and, if we follow this and proceed on its lines, believing what
   God says, all will be clear, simple and easy. But if, whenever God says
   on thing we immediately assume and assert that he means another thing,
   we shall, obviously, have as many different interpretations as we have
   interpreters! And who is to direct us in such a chaos of conflicting
   opinions.

   Were it our aim to enumerate these opinions, and help to [make] a
   choice between them, our task would be greater than we could undertake
   or carry out. But, as our aim is to treat the book as God's own
   description and explanation of the events which are to take place when
   the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, our task will be a happy
   one; for it will be to try to understand what God says and not what man
   thinks.

   We shall find ourselves giving little more than a translation of God's
   own words, first setting them forth according to His own plan.

   That this plan is correct and true is not open even to question. It is
   so simple that a child will be able to understand it.

   After the Introduction (chap. i), which corresponds exactly with the
   Conclusion (chap. xxii. 6-21); and the Instruction for people on the
   earth during that Day (chap. ii, iii.), which corresponds with matters
   concerning people on the New Earth, in chap. xxi. 1 - xxii. 5, we find
   that the whole body of the book is divided for us into seven pairs of
   connected events.

   Perhaps the simplest form in which to first exhibit this will be the
   following:â?"

   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A | i. Introduction.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B | ii, iii. The People on Earth.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  X | iv. 1 - xx. 15. Visions.
   Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B | xxi. 1 - xxii. 5. The People on the New
   Earth.
   Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  A | xxii. 6-21. Conclusion

   Now, the Holy Spirit has divided the central number, which we have
   marked "X," and which occupies the larger part of the book, into seven
   parts. Each of these seven parts consists of two scenes: The former of
   which takes place "in Heaven," and the latter "on Earth."

   If we examine these more closely, we shall find that they are
   correlative: i.e., the scene "in Heaven" is preliminary to, and
   explanatory of, the events which follow "on Earth." Things are seen "in
   Heaven," and words are there uttered which show the nature and object
   of what is about to take place "on Earth."

   When God has described a scene as taking place "in Heaven," and caused
   Heavenly voices to give the key to what is to follow in another scene
   which immediately takes place "on earth"; and this is done seven
   consecutive times; is it not strange that writers on the Apocalypse
   should overlook this exceedingly simple arrangement; and proceed to
   elaborate some complicated analysis of their own; and thus wholly
   ignore and break up the division which God has Himself made and given
   and marked off so clearly by the repeated expressions "in Heaven" and
   "upon the Earth," on purpose to guide us in understanding His book?

   How can we trust any analysis, however clever it may be, if these
   divisions are broken into, and the Heavenly and earthly scenes are
   mixed together? All must be confusion. And any such division of the
   book, or any which proceeds on the lines of the chapter-divisions, as
   given in the authorised version, will be found useless for the purpose
   of gathering the real scope of the book.

   Before we proceed further it may be well to set out these Divine
   divisions more fully.

   Â

   The more intently we look on this, and the more carefully we study it,
   the more shall we be struck by its beauty and simplicity. How clear,
   compared with man's complicated division made according to his own
   fancy! So clear that the humblest child of God cannot fail to grasp it.
   It requires no explanation; but it will itself explain all things to us
   if we have ears to hear.

   It is remarkable that in each of these wondrous scenes "in Heaven"
   voices with utterances and songs are heard. Not one Heavenly scene is
   without some Heavenly voice or utterance. Indeed, there are, altogether
   seventeen of these distributed in these seven scenes "in Heaven"; and
   this distribution helps us to discover the order and arrangement of
   these seven pairs respectively.

   No. iv. evidently is the great central pair; both from actual position
   as well as from its subject matter. As to position, it occupies,
   literally and actually, the central part of the book; while as to its
   subject matter, we shall see (when we come to consider it) that it is
   as important as its position declares it to be.

   Then, Nos. i. and vii. are marked off as corresponding, by the fact
   that out of the seventeen heavenly voices ten are in these two pairs;
   six being the first scene "in heaven," and four in the last. The
   heavenliness of Nos. i. and vii. is also more marked than in any of the
   others: for all heaven is engaged in either giving these utterances, or
   singing these songs; [58] and it is only in these two scenes that the
   four Zoa, or living ones, utter their voices.

   In Nos. ii. and vi. we also have another pair â?" the former
   characterised by the trumpets, and the latter by the vials â?" the two
   most solemn portions of all the judgments which the book contains.
   Moreover, it is remarkable that it is in these two that those who pass
   through, or come out of, the great tribulation are specially mentioned
   as giving these heavenly utterances.

   It appears, therefore, from this that these seven pairs are arranged as
   an Epanodos: that is to say, the first corresponds with the last (the
   seventh); the second with the sixth; the third with the fifth; while
   the fourth stands out in the centre; emphasising, by its central
   position, its important teaching.

   They may be set out formally and briefly thus:

   Â Â Â  i | Longer and more full of heavenly voices and utterances. (Six
   in all).
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ii | The Trumpets.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  iii | Shorter and less detail.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  iv | Central in
   subject and position.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  v | Shorter and less detail.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  vi | The Vials.
   Â Â Â  vii | Longer and more full of heavenly voices and utterances.
   (Four in all).

   Â

   THE HEAVENLY VOICES

   are also portioned out according to the above plan:

   Â Â Â  i | All heaven (6). The four Zoa, or Living ones, and
   twenty-four Elders; only here and in No. vii.
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ii | Those out of the great tribulation (2).
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  iii | Great voices (2).
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  iv | A loud
   voice (1).
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  v | Great voices (1).
   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  vi | Those out of the great tribulation (1).
   Â Â Â  vii | All heaven (4). The four Zoa, or Living Ones, and
   twenty-four Elders; only here and in No. i.

   Â

   From all this it is clear that we have to do with Divine handiwork when
   we come to the study of this book.

   We have before us not one of the many Apocalyptic writings which have
   been put forth at various times by men, which are for the most part
   unintelligible dreamings; [59] but we have on which differs from, and
   stands out amid, them all; having the Divine impress stamped upon it;
   thus marking it as worthy of our deepest attention and most reverent
   study.

   It may be well to append a complete list or table of these utterances
   as a guide to their further study by our readers: â?"

   We shall note, as we proceed, the relation of these Heavenly Voices to
   the transactions which follow on the earth. Meanwhile, our readers may
   make out for themselves a more complete list of these utterances, and
   study the distinguishing features of each.

   Before closing this chapter, we may add the following from Canon
   Bernard's Progress of Doctrine in the New Testament. [60] Â He
   beautifully expands the thought and the truth involved in the seven
   pairs of alternate visions which we have pointed out as being "in
   heaven" and "on earth." He says:â?"

   "We have here.... a doctrine of the history of the consummation: I mean
   that, besides a prophetic record of the facts of the history, we have
   (what is of much higher value) an exposition of the nature of the
   history. The book is a revelation of the connection between things that
   are seen and things that are not seen, between things on earth [61] and
   things in heaven [62] ; a revelation which fuses both into one mighty
   drama; so that the movements of human action, and the course of visible
   fact, are half shrouded, half disclosed, amid the glory and the terror
   of the spiritual agencies at work around us, and of the eternal
   interests which we see involved. We are borne to the courts above, and
   the temple of God is opened in heaven, [63] and we behold the events on
   earth [64] as originating in what passes there. There seals are broken,
   trumpets are sounded, and vials are poured out, which rule the changes
   [of the world]... While we are looking down through the rolling mists
   on things that pass below, we are all the time [in vision] before the
   throne of God and of the Lamb, and among the four-and-twenty elders,
   the four living beings, and the innumerable company of angels; and we
   hear voices proceeding out of the throne... and hallelujahs that roll
   through the universe. We see, further, that there is cause for this
   participation of the world above in the events of the world below; for
   it becomes more plain that the earth is the battlefield of the kingdoms
   of light and darkness. There is a far bolder revelation that we have
   had before of the presence and action of the powers of evil. The Old
   Serpent is on one side, as the Lamb is on the other; and the same light
   which shows the movements of the Head and Redeemer of our race, falls
   also upon those of the enemy and destroyer. In the sense of this
   connection between things seen and things not seen lies the secret of
   that awe, and elevation of mind, which we felt as children when we
   first turned these pages; and the assurance that it has an ever
   increasing value to him who has painfully sought to test the mingled
   form of good and ill, and to discern some plan and purpose in the
   confused scene around him" (pp. 193, 194).

   "The books is a doctrine of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. 'Behold He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him.'
   [65] Â  That is the first voice, and the key-note of the whole. The
   Epistles...[in chaps. ii. and iii.] ... all take their tone from this
   thought, and are the voice of a Lord who will 'come quickly.' The
   visions which follow draw to the same end, and the last voices of the
   book respond to the first, and attest its subject and its purpose. 'He
   which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even
   so come, Lord Jesus.' [66] ... Toward that hope our eyes have been
   steadily directed in the former Apostolic writings; but it is here
   presented, not so much in relation to our personal life as to the
   kingdom of God and to the world itself upon the whole. It appears here
   as the (...) (the sunteleia or consummation of the age), towards which
   all things tend... Differences and uncertainties of interpretation as
   to the details... still leave us under the sense that it is a history
   of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. This assurance,
   enjoyed at all times, grows clearer in the days of trouble, rebuke and
   blasphemy: and the darkest times which the prophecy forebodes will be
   those in which its fullest uses will be found." [67]

                          The Introduction: Chapter 1

   We now have to deal with each of these eighteen large members [as
   previously outlined]. We must expand the structure of each; and then
   give a translation, with such explanatory remarks as may be necessary
   to help us in understanding the inspired words.

   We are aware that some persons consider these structures as more or
   less fanciful.

   But we may ask, why are we to make a distinction between God's words
   and God's works? "All his works are perfect." Students of science never
   weary in examining them; and the more closely they examine them the
   more of this perfection do they discover in their structure, order,
   arrangement, beauty, etc., etc.

   But God's words are part of His Works. Why should not students of God's
   Word deal with it in the same way, and expect to find the same
   perfection of structure, order and beauty? Why are His words to be
   treated as though they were imperfect, and His works perfect?

   It is written, "The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them
   that have pleasure therein." (Ps. cxi. 2).

   We believe that His words also are great and perfect; and as we have,
   and trust our readers also have, intense "pleasure therein," we propose
   to seek them out and to "search" the Scriptures, so that we may all be
   able to say, "I rejoice at Thy word, as one that findeth great spoil"
   (Ps. cxix. 162).

   Our readers are exhorted to study them carefully, for they are the key
   to the whole Book. They show us what is the Scope of the whole; and
   also of its various parts. They tell us what is emphatic; and what are
   the special points on which we are to fix our attention. Thus we shall
   have a constant and never-failing guide ever at hand to direct our
   studies and control our thoughts.

   In the consideration of these Structures we shall get such an
   impression of the Divine source of the Book and of its perfections
   (even though we may not fully grasp them), that we shall be impelled to
   receive its revelation as "the Word of God," and "not as the Word of
   men" (I Thess. ii. 13).

   The INTRODUCTION (chap. i) is constructed on exactly the same plan as
   the CONCLUSION (xxii. 6-21).

   Each consists of four pairs of four members each.

   It is not always, or even often, that the Introduction and Conclusion
   of a book thus correspond with each other.

   But this book of the Revelation is peculiar. Four is the number
   symbolising that which has to do with the earth; and sixteen is the
   square of four. It is significant that this book should be rounded off
   so perfectly as to declare, thus, outwardly and symbolically, that it
   relates to this earth; and to the putting square of all that concerns
   it.

   Everything is out of course now: but all is to be put square ere long;
   and in this book we are told how it is going to be done.

   The following is the structure of chapter i., which forms the
   "Introduction" to the whole book. To appreciate it more, we ought
   carefully to compare it with the structure of the "Conclusion," which
   will be given in its place.

       A |   E^^1 | a^^1 | i. 1. The angel testifying.
                           b^^1| 2. The things testified.
                                   F^^1 | c^^1 | 3-. Benediction.
   ("Blessed.")
                                               d^^1 | -3. Advent. ("The
   time is at hand.")
               E^^2 | a^^2 | 4-. John testifying.
                           b^^2 | -4,5-. The things testified.
                                   F^^2 | c^^2 | -5,6. Ascription. ("Unto
   Him.")
                                               d^^2 | 7,8. Advent ("Behold
   He cometh.")
               E^^3 | a^^3 | 9-. John testifying.
                           b^^3 | -9-11. The things testified.
                                   F^^3 |     d^^3 | 12-16. Advent.
   (Visions of the Coming One.)
                                           c^^3 | 17-. Salutation. ("Fear
   not.")
               E^^4 | a^^4 | -17-18. Jesus testifying (of Himself).
                           b^^4 | 19. The things testified.
                                   F^^4 |     d^^4 | 20-. Advent. (Vision
   12-16, d3) referred to.)
                                           c^^4 | -20. Interpretation.
   ("The 7 stars are," &c.)

   This Structure shows us that the emphasis is specially placed on two
   things:--

   The Advent (F), and
   Testimony concerning the Advent (E).

   In each of the latter of the two pairs (F^^1, F^^2, F^^3, and F^^4) the
   Advent is alternated with four other subjects:--

   Benediction,
   Ascription,
   Salutation, and
   Interpretation.

   But these are introverted. For, whereas, in the first two pairs the
   Advent follows the Benediction and the Ascription respectively, it
   precedes the Salutation and the Interpretation in the last two pairs.

   Moreover, the Advent is testified in two ways. In the first two pairs
   (d^^1 and d^^2) it is testified in words; but in the last two pairs
   (d^^3 and d^^4) it is testified in vision. Our attention is called to
   this difference by the Introversions in F^^3 and F^^4.

   And now, to show how perfectly, not only the introduction, as a whole,
   is constructed, but also, how perfect are each of its parts (or
   members), we must expand the first member, E1, as an example, in full.

   This makes it perfectly clear that in these first two verses we have
   the essence of the whole book. This first member, consisting of these
   two verses, is divided into two parts, which have a perfect
   correspondence with each other. This correspondence is hidden by the
   faulty human verse-division. In each division we have the same four
   subjects, viz., giving of the Book; Its medium, purpose, and subject;
   first, in Intention; and then, in Execution.

   E^^1, i. 1, 2. The Angel Testifying and the Things Testified.

   Intention |
   E^^1 | e | 1-. The Revelation Given]    "The Revelation of Jesus
   Christ, which God gave
               f | -1-. The Medium]    "unto him,
                   g | -1-. The Purpose]    "to show unto his servants
                       h | -1-. The Subject]   "things which must shortly
   come to pass;
   Execution |
   E^^1 | e | -1-. The Revelation Given]    "And he sent and signified it
               f | -1-. The Medium]   "by his angel
                   g | -1,2-. The Purpose]   "unto his servant John: who
   bare record
                       h | -2. The Subject]   "of the word of God, and the
   testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all
   things that he saw."


   We need not proceed further with the expansions of all these members.

   Our readers will have noticed that, in E^^1, we have combined the full
   text with the outline or skeleton of the structure. But this text is
   from the Authorized Version. In our Exposition we propose to give our
   own Translation, with such explanatory notes as may serve to make it
   clear.


   THE TRANSLATION OF E^^1, chap. i. 1, 2.

   i. 1. THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST]   This is the Divine title of the
   book. All other titles, whether ancient or modern, are human, and are
   therefore not worth discussing, or even enumerating. The book is often
   called the Apocalypse, which is the transliteration of the Greek word
   rendered "Revelation." (...) means literally an unveiling, from (...)
   apo away from, and (...) kalupto, to veil: and may be understood either
   of the taking a veil from a person, and so causing him to become
   visible (as when a statue is said to be unveiled); or of taking a veil
   from the future, and disclosing the course of events which shall take
   place. [68] Probably both senses are true here. And, if the latter,
   then it shows us that what follows in this book is to be taken
   literally; for, when the Lord would not reveal, but would hide the
   meaning of His words, He spoke in parables and used emblems (Matt.
   xiii. 10-16. Mark iv. 11, 12).

   With (...) en in, i.e. When he shall be revealed, 2 Thess. i. 7. 1 Pet.
   iv. 13.

   Manifestation, Rom. viii. 19.

   Appearing, 1 Pet. i. 7.

   Coming, 1 Cor. i. 7 (marg. revelation).

   With (...) eis into, To lighten, Luke. ii. 32.

   which God gave to Him]   Here it is not the Father who instructs His
   children; but , it is "God," as Sovereign, who informs His "servants"
   through Christ, who is (in His mediatorial character) emphatically the
   Servant (see Is. xlii. 1, 7, &c.), where, as a "bruised reed" and
   "smoking flax," He is not broken or quenched "till He have set judgment
   in the earth." The time has now come for Him to execute this judgment:
   and therefore God, from His throne of government, gives to His Servant,
   Jehovah-Jesus, to show. (Compare John v. 19, 20; vii. 16; viii. 28;
   xii. 49; xiv. 10; xvii. 7, 8. Matt. xi. 27. Mark xiii. 32. Acts. i. 7).

   to show]   Here we have the same word as that which is used in the
   opening of the "Conclusion" of this book (xxii. 6). It means to to
   present to view, and has a close connection with the visions and signs
   (compare Matt. iv. 8; viii. 4). But it must not be restricted to this,
   as is clear from Matt. xvi. 21. [69]

   to His servants]   Not "all Christians" (as such), as Alford says, but
   to Israel, to whom the word "servant" peculiarly belongs. We have
   already said something on this subject, so that we need only add that
   it is not used of Christians in the Pauline Epistles, but it is in 1
   Cor. vii. 22, and in four cases where he refers to himself and others
   as singled out for special service. Indeed, in one place an important
   argument is built on the emphatic distinction between servants and sons
   (Gal. iv. 7): "Wherefore thou are no more a servant, but a son." (See 2
   Cor. vi. 17, 18, and compare John xv. 15).

   On the other hand, it is used fourteen times of those who are the
   subject of the Apocalypse. In the Old Testament it is the common word
   for Israel under the covenant of works. (See Lev. xxv. 42, 55. Isa.
   xlix. 3; lxv. 15, &c., &c.).

   what things must needs come to pass]   by the necessity of Divine
   ruling and over-ruling. That is to say, they are not left to chance,
   for they must needs come to pass. We have the exact words here from the
   Septuagint of Dan. ii. 29. In other words, God will fulfil that which
   He reveals.

   with speed]   (...) en tache occurs eight times, [70] from which our
   readers may themselves see that it is used in two senses: quickly, as
   to speed; and soon, as to time. Both may be true here: and, if the
   latter (according to Luke. xviii. 8) be relied on, then we must note
   that delay is implied, "though He bear long with them" (verse 7). Such
   delay is implied in Rev. x. 6: "for there shall be no more delay." In
   God's speedy time (with whom a thousand years are as one day, 2 Pet.
   iii. 8), He will bring them to pass; and when that time comes He will
   do it with speed, and "make a short work of it" (Rom. ix. 28).

   and He signified it]   i.e., God, see xxii. 6. The word means
   (etymologically) to show by signs: but it must not be restricted to
   this meaning, as the other occurrences of the word clearly show. See
   John xii. 33; xviii. 32; xxi. 19. Acts xi. 28; xxv. 27. Rev. i. 1. The
   restriction referred to has caused the Apocalypse to be looked upon as
   a book of signs and symbols which no one can understand. The fact is
   that about half the symbols (14) are definitely explained (though these
   explanations are often again taken by expositors as being symbolical!)
   Being Divinely explained, they serves as a key to those which are
   unexplained. [71]

   sending by His angel to His servant John]   John, like Paul and others,
   was singled out for this special service to his own fellow-servants.
   Compare Isa. xlix. 5. Amos iii. 7.

   2. who testified]   The past tense shows that the Introduction, though
   coming first, was necessarily written last. The word connects the
   Introduction with the Conclusion. Compare i. 1 with xxii. 16, 20. The
   only three occurrences in this book. It means here not only testified,
   but published and made known.

   of (or, as to) the Word of God]   We have seen above that this is the
   common idiomatic phrase for a direct prophetic communication. This,
   therefore, stands first, and is used of the whole book.

   and the testimony of Jesus Christ]  i.e., which He testified when on
   earth. This book or prophetic word does not go outside the scope of
   what Jesus bare testimony to, in His own prophetic teaching. That is
   the essence of the prophecy of this book, and the "spirit" of it. See
   xxii. 6.

   what things soever he saw]   Not only what he heard as a direct
   prophetic message, but what he saw represented in vision. God gave the
   Revelation to Christ, Christ signified by His angel to John; and John
   hereby makes it known. He says, in xxii. 8 (where we have another
   connecting link between the Conclusion and the Introduction), "I John
   saw these things, and heard them." We have also another proof, in this
   past tense (i. 2), that the Introduction was written last; or, at any
   rate, after the seeing and the hearing referred to.

   The second member, F^^2, consists of only one verse (i. 3); the subject
   of which is two-fold:-- viz., Benediction, and The Advent.

   It may be expanded as follows:--


   THE EXPANSION OF F^^2, chap. i. 3.
   Benediction and Advent.

       F^^2 | i | 3- Benediction ]    "Blessed
                   j | k | -3-. Persons ]   "be he that readeth, and they
   that hear
                           l | -3-. Words ]   "the words of this prophecy,
                   j | k | -3-. Persons ]   "and keep
                           l | -3-. Words ]   "those things that are
   written therein:
            | i | -3. Reason ]   "for the time is at hand."


   THE TRANSLATION OF F^^2, chap. i. 3.

   3. Blessed (or, happy) be he that readeth, and they who hear ]   This
   points to one reader and many listeners (Luke iv. 16). From the neglect
   of this book, one would suppose it said, "Blessed are those who do not
   read." So openly is this blessing rejected; yea, sometimes boastfully!
   If there be a reference here to public reading, then the neglect of
   this book indeed stands exposed, and the attitude so generally assumed
   with regard to it is tacitly condemned.

   the words of this prophecy ]   There is a reference here to the spoken
   words, especially to the seventeen heavenly utterances, as distinct
   from the things written. The words spoken are the key to the things
   written, for it is added:

   and keep in mind the things which stand written therein ]    "Keep" is
   a Hebrew idiom. The word (...) shamar means to remember, to ponder
   upon. See the LXX. translation of it in Gen. xvii. 9, xxxvii. 11. Num.
   xxviii. 2, etc. Compare also Luke i. 66, "and all they that heard them
   (the sayings) laid them up in their hearts"; Luke ii. 19, "But Mary
   kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart." So also verse
   51. The word is used also of remembering so as to obey; but this can
   hardly be appropriate here, for "prophecy" is not precept.

   for the season is near ]   The word (...) kairos refers to the ordained
   and appointed time, viz., the time occupied by what is written, i.e.,
   the Advent of the Day of the Lord. The prophecy of this book is not to
   be put aside as though it referred to things so remote that they have
   no concern for us. But they are always to be regarded as near, and kept
   in our minds, so that our life may be influenced by them, and that we
   may walk in view of the nearness of the Day when the Lord will judge,
   and thus be without care as to this present time in which man is
   judging, which is called "man's day" (1 Cor. iv. 3). Paul shows us how
   this prophecy may be "kept" in a practical manner in 1 Cor. iv. 1-5.

   We need not further minutely expand the various members of this
   Introduction; but proceed with the translation, referring our readers
   to the Structure of E^^2 and F^^2.


   THE TRANSLATION OF E^^2 a^^2, chap. i. 4-.
   John testifying.

   4-. John to the seven assemblies which are in Asia ]   We have already
   shown that the word (...) ecclesia is used in many senses. We take it
   here in the neutral sense of Assembly, which leaves the interpretation
   open. Certain assemblies are specially addressed. They are recognised
   as being on the earth at the time when the things written in this
   prophecy shall be fulfilled. The continued reference in these seven
   Epistles to the body or subject-matter of the Apocalypse shows that
   chaps. ii. and iii. are not to be separated from the rest of the book.
   We shall see this more clearly when we come to the Epistles themselves.
   All are agreed that there will be, and must be, a people on the earth
   during "the Day of the Lord," such as are alluded to in xii. 17; xiii.
   10; xiv. 12, etc.; and all must agree also that they will need some
   special instruction. Where is such instruction, if it be not that which
   is given to them in these seven Epistles? The interpretation of them
   belongs to that day. But that does not shut out such application as may
   have been made by those who read them in John's day; or as may be made
   by us who read them in our own day. Each read, and each get the
   promised blessing, in turn. But, when the Church is caught up to meet
   the Lord in the air, we shall not take away this book and these
   Epistles with us; but those who are left behind will then learn what
   the true interpretation is, as we had never done. They will see the
   fulfilment of what is here prophesied. They, too, will get their
   blessing; and we see in the Jewish Remnant, and the various companies
   of people in this book, what the reality of that blessing will be.


   E^^2 b^^2, i. -4, 5-.

   -4, 5-. Grace to you, and peace, from Him that is, and that was, and
   that is coming ]   Here we have an undoubted reference to, and
   paraphrase of, the name of Jehovah, as revealed in Ex. iii. 14.

   It is not from the Father to His children, as in the Church Epistles;
   but it is from Jehovah as He was revealed and made known to Israel.
   This is in perfect keeping with what we hold to be the scope of the
   book. Three times we have this periphrasis of Jehovah, and yet it is
   varied according to the emphasis we are to place upon it.

   In i. 4 and 8, it is "is, and was, and is to come." In iv. 8, it is,
   "was, and is, and is to come." In xi. 17 it is, "art and wast" ( the
   third or future verb, being omitted according to the critical Greek
   Texts, L. T. Tr. W.H. A.V. and R.V.).

   Hence in ch. i. 4, 8, the emphasis is on "is." In iv. 8, it is on
   "was." And in xi. 17 it is on "art."

   It is for us to learn what this emphasis teaches and we can do so as we
   come to the respective passages.

   and from the seven spirits which are before His throne ]    This fact
   that they are "before," or in the presence of, God's Throne, shows that
   they occupy the position of servants (see 1 Kings x. 8), and of created
   beings (iv. 5, 10; vii. 9, 15; viii. 2; xi. 4, 16; xii. 10; xiv. 3, 5,
   10; xx. 12).

   This one fact ought to have precluded the idea that these seven could
   be one, and that one Divine! There is nothing in the whole Bible which
   represents the Holy Spirit in such a subordinate position. He is equal
   with the Father and with the Son.

   On the other hand, angels are constantly represented as occupying this
   position. And angels are again referred to in iv. 5, under the symbol
   of seven lamps (to which other spiritual creatures are likened in Ezek.
   i. 13).

   There are other references to these seven angels in the book: e.g.,
   viii. 2. "The seven": i.e., the well-known, or before mentioned seven.

   Angels are specially called "spirits." See Heb. i. 7, 14. Psa. civ. 4.
   "He maketh His angels spirits." The word is used of any spiritual
   being, higher than men, and lower than Deity; without corporeal garb of
   "flesh and blood." Where there is any doubt as to the nature of these
   beings, they are always defined: e.g., a "dumb spirit," Mark ix. 17.
   Compare verse 20. Luke ix. 39; x. 20; xiii. 11. Matt. viii. 16. Acts
   xvi. 16. [72]

   In Acts viii. 26, "the angel of the Lord" was sent on a special mission
   to Philip. Immediately afterwards he is called (verse 29) "the spirit"
   who spake to Philip; and then, in verse 39, the same angelic messenger
   is called "the spirit" [73] of the Lord," who ended his mission by
   catching Philip away to Azotus. In Rev. iii. 1, we have the seven
   spirits of God joined with the seven stars. In Rev. v. 6, we see these
   "seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." If it be objected
   that this interpretation opens the door to angel-worship, the answer is
   that the door is effectually closed in this very book, in xix. 10;
   xxii. 9: "See thou do it not."

   If it be objected that "angels" would not be mentioned in connection
   with God and the Lord Jesus, the answer is that they are so mentioned
   in 1 Tim. v. 21, "God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels."
   Are these the Holy Spirit? The answer is No! The thought embodied in
   this combination here, in Rev. i. 4, is not so much the Triune Deity,
   as such; but that of the supreme High Court of heaven having
   jurisdiction on earth; angels being the assessors. Compare Mark viii.
   38. Luke ix. 26; xii. 8, where we have a similar thought.

   Nowhere do we find the Holy Spirit associated with the Father and the
   Son in any salutation. Not even in the Pauline Church Epistles. In
   those Epistles, He is viewed as being here on earth with the Church,
   and grace and peace come from Heaven; from the Father and the Son.

   In this dispensation angels are our servants, see Heb. i. 14; ii. 1, 2,
   5. In the coming Dispensation, after the Church is removed, Angels are
   no longer servants, they are associated with Heaven's high court, and
   are connected with the throne. The Son Himself will act as "before the
   angels of God." (Luke xii. 8, 9).

   All these grounds are from Scripture; but the objections to them are
   only what interpreters find it "difficult to believe." It is a question
   of what God has said; and not what man may think difficult or easy to
   believe.

   5. and from Jesus Christ ]   The once humbled One who is now exalted
   and glorified.

   the Faithful witness ]   Compare Isa. lv. 4.

   the First-born of the dead ]   See Col. i. 18.

   and the Ruler of the kings of the earth ]   It is remarkable that all
   these three titles are combined in Psa. lxxxix. 27, 37. "I will make
   him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth... his throne
   shall be as a faithful witness in heaven?" See also Isa. lii. 15. Rev.
   vi. 15; xvii. 4; xix. 16. the comparison with the kings of the earth is
   parallel with Psa. ii. 2.

   The sudden change from the genitive case (of Jesus Christ) to the
   Nominatives which follow it, is very remarkable; and implies the
   immutability of the Divine Nature, as in "that is, and that was, and
   that is coming" above; we might also compare Heb. xiii. 8, or supply,
   as in the A.V. "who is."

   These titles have no relation to the Church of God, but to Dominion in
   the earth. It is the fulfilment of Luke i. 32, which is about to take
   place: hence this appropriate titles are here assumed. In Dan. viii.
   25, Christ is spoken of as the "Prince of princes," but only in
   connection with Israel. That we have here an earthly rule: and that the
   Dominion in the Earth is about to be taken and used by the Son of Man,
   is clear from many Scriptures. (See Rev. xi. 17, 18; xvii. 14; xix. 16.
   Psa. ii., xlv., cx. Isa. ix. 6, 7).


   F^^2 c^^2, i. -5, 6.
   Ascription.

   To Him that loveth us ]   All the critical Greek Texts and R.V. read
   the present and not the past participle here. We have given our reasons
   above in our ninth point, for our belief that this expression is one of
   those which belongs peculiarly to Israel. And the present participle
   here tells us that Jehovah's love to Israel is everlasting (Jer. xxxi.
   3. Isa. liv. 10); that He who chose their fathers, and loved them, is
   now about to show that that love is still a present love, and what it
   is about to do for them.

   and washed (or loosed [74] ) us from our sins ]    The reading here is
   somewhat doubtful. We have given both, for both contain parts of the
   whole truth. "Washed," is more vivid here, and more in accordance with
   Hebrew idiom. For "washed," see Psa. li. 2, 7. Isa. i. 16, 18. Ezek.
   xxxvi. 25. Heb. x. 22: and for "loosed," compare Matt. xx. 28. Heb. ix.
   12. Rev. v. 9; xiv. 3, 4. In either case this is the fulfilment of Psa.
   cxxx. 8, "He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities," and of Isa.
   xl. 1, 2, where Jehovah says, "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith
   your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her that her
   warfare (or appointed time) is accomplished, that her iniquity is
   pardoned." And this is the object of the coming of Jehovah Jesus, as
   announced in Matt. i. 21, "He shall save his people from their sins."

   by His blood]   Certainly not "in" His blood. Such a thing was never
   heard of in the Old Testament. It was not "in" blood that sins were
   purged away, but "by" blood, for blood itself was a cause of
   defilement. It was by the precious atoning merits of Him of whose death
   the blood speaks. [75]

   6. and He made us to be a kingdom and priests]    This is Hebrew in
   idiom and in meaning. The explanation will be found in Ex. xix. 6,
   where God says, respecting Israel (not the Church!), " ye shall be unto
   Me a kingdom of priests"; which the Septuagint renders "a royal
   priesthood." These also are the words written to "elect strangers," the
   Dispersion in I Peter ii. 5, 9. It is the figure Hendiadys, by which
   the noun "kingdom" become a superlative adjective. Thus, "and He made
   us priests--yes, and royal priests, too"; or, 'He made us a kingly
   order--the members of which are holy and set apart for the service of
   God.' We are aware that these words are unlawfully claimed and
   appropriated by the Church, and used as a poor and weak argument
   against the pretensions of Rome and Romanisers. Where do we read one
   word about the Christians being priests, in any one of the Epistles
   addressed to believers by the Holy Spirit through Paul? The very
   thought is foreign to Scripture, and contrary to fact. But such
   promises were directly and distinctly made to Israel. See, as to
   priests, Is. lxi. 6.  I Pet. ii. 5 (and compare Rev. v. 10 and xx. 6).
   As to kings, see Ps. xlix. 14.  Dan. vii. 22, 27.  Matt. xix. 28.  Luke
   xxii. 29, 30 (and compare Rev. ii. 26, 27, and iii. 21). There can
   clearly be no priests of any kind in this Dispensation. The Epistle to
   the Hebrews teaches that the Aaronic order has no longer any place; and
   that the Melchizedec order is absorbed in Jesus Christ (Heb.
   vi.-viii.). If Christians, to-day, are kings, who are their subjects?
   and if they are priests, where and for whom do they perform priestly
   duties? For priestly service was on behalf of others, "first for his
   own sins; and then for the people's" (Heb. v. 1; vii. 27).

   to His God and Father]   (see John xx. 17). Not "our" Father, as in the
   Pauline Epistles (I Thess. i. 3; iii. 11, etc.). In due season this
   ascription shall be realised, as we see from chap. xx. 4. With regard
   to the word "Father" introduced here, we have to remember that the
   Priest's office was hereditary. Only Aaron's sons were priests.

   to Him be the glory and the dominion for ever and ever (Lit., unto the
   ages of the ages.) Amen]   To Him (of course) who " loved the people"
   (Deut. xxxiii. 3) is this ascription given. The Greek here for "unto
   the ages of the ages" is merely a literal rendering of the Hebrew
   idiom. Such an expression for eternity was unknown to the Classical
   Greek writers.


   F^^2 d^^2, i. 7, 8.
   Advent.

   7. Behold,]   Our attention is thus called to what is the sequel to all
   that has been said. We are to gaze by faith on this wondrous and solemn
   fact.

   He cometh with (or, amid the) clouds]    This is an Old Testament
   reference. Lit., with the clouds, i.e., with the clouds so often
   mentioned in connection with His coming in glory. Believers are to be
   "caught up in clouds to meet the Lord in the air."  They will accompany
   the Lord when "He comes with clouds" to the earth. Two very different
   scenes are described, here and in I Thess. iv. 17. This is the same
   aspect of His coming as that mentioned in Matt. xxiv. 30.  "THEN (i.e.,
   "immediately" after the great tribulation) shall appear the sign of the
   Son of Man (Rev. i. 13) in heaven: and THEN shall all the tribes of the
   earth (or the Land) mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in
   (or with) the clouds of heaven with power and great glory (i.e., with
   great and glorious power)." The clouds are mentioned as His chariot in
   Psalm xviii. 11; civ. 3. Compare also Ex. xix. 16; xl. 34.   Is. vi. 4;
   xix.1.  Ezek. i. 4.  The passages specially connected with Rev. i. 7
   are Dan. vii. 13, 14.  Matt. xxiv. 30; xxvi. 64, and Mark xiv. 62.

   and every eye shall see Him]   "Eye" is put by Synecdoche for person,
   i.e., everyone on the earth will see Him.  So Matt. xxiv. 30.  But not
   the Church of God, for it will be then already in heaven, and not on
   the earth.

   even those very ones who pierced Him]    These are specially singled
   out--"all those who," for His brethren, like Joseph's brethren, will
   then mourn for Him. Compare John xix. 34, which quotes Zech. xii. 10.
   [76]

   and all the tribes of the Land]   Not "kindreds," for the word is the
   same as in Matt. xxiv. 30. And it is the tribes "of the Land," not of
   the whole earth. The tribes of Israel are the subject here, as in v. 5;
   vii. 4-8; and xxi. 12.

   will wail because of Him]   i.e., at (the) sight of Him; or, over Him.
   This very wailing is described in Zech. xii. 10-12, and is there
   declared to take place "in that day," the day of the Lord. This fixes
   for us the sense in which "the Lord's day" is to be taken in Rev. i.
   10.

   How can the Church of God be brought in here? Did the Church of God
   pierce Him? Are the members of the Body of Christ members also of the
   "Tribes of the Land"? And what have they to wail and beat themselves
   for, when they are distinctly told that "the day of the Lord" shall not
   come upon them as a thief (1 Thess. v. 4), but that it will come upon
   others "as travail upon a woman with child; and THEY shall not escape"
   (I Thess v. 3). Those who can bring the Church in here cannot possibly
   have any true conception of what the Church is. Even this mourning of
   Israel will be very different from the fear and trembling and
   destruction which will come upon the Gentiles. See Isa. ii. 19.  Rev.
   vi. 16.  Israel's mourning will be with that repentance which is so
   often spoken of as the one necessary condition of national blessing.

   Yea: Amen]    A double confirmation of the truth of this solemn
   statement. Compare the conclusion, xxii. 20. The figure is Synonymia,
   i.e., the use of synonymous words in order to strengthen the certainty
   of this prophecy.

   8. I am Alpha and Omega [77] ]   What this means is explained in verse
   17, and again in xxii. 13. This is a Hebraism, in common use among the
   Ancient Jewish Commentators to designate the whole of anything from the
   beginning to the end; e.g., "Adam transgressed the whole law from (...)
   (Aleph) to (...) (Tau)"; [78]   "Abraham kept the whole law from (...)
   to (...)." [79]    The article is used in the Greek, but it is not
   required either by the Hebrew or English idioms. Here it means "the
   first and the last," as explained in verse 17 and xxii. 12, 13. This
   title is not a church title, but is specially used in connection with
   Israel. See Ex. iii. 14.  Isa. xli. 4; xliii. 10; xliv. 6, 8; xlviii.
   12;  and Rev. xxi. 6.

   saith the LORD God [80] ]    Another Old Testament title, used first in
   Gen. ii. See also remarks on this. The title "Jehovah" (or LORD)
   expresses His covenant relation with Israel; "God" expresses His
   relationship as Creator with mankind as a whole.

   that is, and that was, and that is coming]   See our notes on this
   above, on verse 4. The emphasis is on the word "is," as shown, by being
   put first.

   the Almighty]    We have considered this title above and its bearing on
   our conviction that it points to relationship with Israel. (...) (ho
   pantokrator) is rendered in the Septuagint as the equivalent for "the
   Lord of hosts."  In Amos iv. 13 as "God of hosts";  in Job it is used
   for "Shaddai." The word is used only once in the New Testament outside
   the Apocalypse, and that in a quotation from Jer. xxxi. 1, 9,
   concerning Israel's future (2 Cor. vi. 18). What the combination of
   these titles says to us here is this: "I, the Almighty Lord of hosts,
   the unchangeable God, will accomplish all My will, fulfil all My word,
   and execute all My judgments."

   We now come to the third set of four members: in which we find the same
   subjects repeated; but not precisely in the same order. In the former
   two the Advent follows the Benediction and the Ascription; while in the
   latter two it precedes the Salutation and the Interpretation.


   E^^3a^^3 i. 9-.
   John Testifying.

   9 I John]   as in i. 4, and in the Conclusion, xxii. 8. Compare also
   Dan. vii. 28; ix. 2; x. 2. The word "also" must be omitted.

   even (or, both) your brother]   according to the flesh, as well as in a
   higher relation. (Compare Acts ix. 30; xi. 29. Rev. xii. 10, &c.)

   and partaker with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patience]
   The construction and order of the Greek here is pronounced by
   commentators as "peculiar." Alford calls it "startling." This is
   because the Figure of speech is not discerned. It is Hendiatris, i.e.,
   three words are used, but only one thing is meant. The one thing is
   "the tribulation," and the two other words characterise it as being,
   not the tribulation which the world experiences, but that (for the
   article is emphatic here) which is specially connected with the
   "Kingdom" (Acts xiv. 22.  2 Tim. ii. 12;   and Rev. xx. 6), and that
   which needs "patient waiting" (Rev. ii. 2, 3, 19; iii. 10; xiii. 10;
   xiv. 12).

   which are in [81] Jesus]   Not "of Jesus," as A.V. But in Him, in His
   Kingdom and in His patient waiting (2 Thess. iii. 5 marg., and R.V.
   Comp. Heb. x. 13). John stood in the same relation to these things as
   those to whom he wrote. Their brotherhood was "in Jesus."  But the
   fellowship of the Church of God is always said to be "in Christ" (never
   "in Jesus"). The members of His body died in Him, and are risen in Him.
   Henceforth they know Him no more after the flesh [82] (2 Cor. v. 15,
   17), but stand on new or resurrection ground; and know Him as the great
   and glorious Head in Heaven of that Body of which they are the members
   here on earth.


   E^^3 b^^3  i. -9-11.
   The Things Testified.

   (I) came to be in the isle that is called Patmos]     The verb is (...)
   (egenomon), not the verb to be. It means to come to be; and, when used
   of an event, we can say, it came to pass. But how are we to render it
   when it is used of a person?  "Came to be" is not happy English. "Found
   myself " is perhaps better. The word describes a fact, though it does
   not explain it. That explanation, therefore, follows:--

   because of the Word of God, and [83] the testimony of Jesus [84] ]
   The preposition (...) (dia), with the accusative case following,
   denotes the occasion or object, rather than the cause (which would be
   expressed by the Genitive case. But chap. i. 2 settles the point for
   us: for there "the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" are other
   names for this Book (vi. 9 and xx. 4), and consist of "the things which
   John saw in Patmos."   How could he be banished there because of the
   things which he saw there? No! it was because he was to receive and see
   these things that John came to be or found himself in Patmos. He was
   there by Divine Spirit and power in order to receive this Apocalypse or
   Revelation, just as Paul went into Arabia to receive his revelation
   (Gal. i. 15-17) (Compare Gal. ii. 1, 2). That John was banished to
   Patmos on account of his witness for Christ is tradition. That,
   probably, is the reason why it is so universally accepted as a fact;
   though not a hint is given of it here where we should naturally expect
   to find it. We prefer to accept the unanswerable evidence of verse 2,
   which, to our mind, settles the matter as to the object of John's
   coming to be in Patmos. Moreover, he seems to have nothing to hinder
   his seeing and hearing and writing. He had leisure to obey the
   seven-fold command to write. And why does everyone take Patmos
   literally here, when nearly every other place mentioned in this book is
   taken as meaning some different place? Even the places of the seven
   churches are taken by some to be no places at all, but merely periods
   of time! The fact that Patmos is taken literally shows that other
   places mentioned in the Revelation are to be taken literally also;
   especially as we are plainly told when we are not to do so.

   But why Patmos at all? The answer is surely to be found in the fact
   that it was in "the great Sea," which is the central point of the
   Revelation. Rome lay to the West. The Land, the Euphrates, and Babylon
   lay on the East. In the Isle of Patmos then he came to be, and in like
   manner, he tells us:

   10. I came to be (or, found myself), by theSpirit in the day of the
   Lord]    i.e., by the power, or agency, of the Spirit, just as in iv.
   2, xvii. 3, and xxi.10.

   In order to see "visions of God" the prophet Ezekiel (i. 1) was under
   the direct influence and power of the Spirit. John was transported by
   spiritual instrumentality into the scenes which shall take place in the
   Day of the Lord, and records what he then saw in vision:  namely:  the
   things which shall take place literally and actually in that Day. How
   this may have been accomplished we may learn from Ezek. viii. 3: "And
   he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head;
   and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and
   brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem."  In chapter xl. 2, 3,
   he says, "In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
   . . . And he brought me thither."  Ezekiel goes on to record what he
   saw of events and realities in the far distant future, and describes
   the Temple which is then to be built. In Ezek. xi. 24, 25, we read,
   "Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the
   Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision
   that I had seen went up from me. Then I spake unto them of the
   captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me." Those things
   concerned the future restoration of Israel (see verses 16-20). In the
   face of this, why should we go out of our way to put an unmeaning sense
   on the phrase "in the Spirit " in Rev. i. 10?  There is no article in
   the Greek. It is simply "in spirit." There is no reason why the word
   (...) (en) here should not have the sense of "by," denoting in or by
   the power of.  It is rendered "by" 141 times in the New Testament.
   (See, for example, Matt. xxiii. 20, 21, 22.   2 Cor. vi. 6, &c., &c.)
     In this case it would mean here exactly what it means in Ezekiel, by,
   or by the power of the Spirit--by which power John was transported, and
   thus "came to be" in future scenes and times, and saw "visions of God,"
   i.e., visions given by God, which he here records for our learning.
   Compare similar statements, chap. iv. 2; xvii. 3; xxi. 10.

   On the phrase "the Lord's day" see our preliminary propositions.

   and I heard behind me a great (i.e., loud) voice, of a trumpet]    This
   means a voice as loud as a trumpet; the strength, not the quality,
   being the point to be noted.  This trumpet is specially associated in
   the Old Testament with war and with "the Day of the LORD."  See Zeph.
   i. 14-16. "The great day of the LORD is near, and hasteth greatly, it
   is near, even the voice of the day of the LORD: . . . A day of the
   trumpet." &c.   Compare Joel ii. 1. 15:  and iii. 16, where we have the
   same connection.

   11. saying : [85] What thou seest, write in a book]     not in seven
   separate Epistles, but in this Book; so as to be of special service for
   those who will be on the earth in the future Day of the Lord. Not "what
   thou at the present moment seest"; the context and the sequel clearly
   show that the present tense is here used in order to include all that
   he should see, and had actually begun to see. "What thou art seeing"
   carries on the action right through, so as to include all that we now
   have in this Book. Hence it is that the present tense is so often used;
   e.g., "are proceeding" (iv. 5); "is descending" (xvi. 21), &c.

   and send it to (or, for, i.e., for their use) the seven [86] assemblies
   [87] unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto
   Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto
   Laodicea]     We cannot believe that these places are used symbolically
   of seven successive stages of ecclesiastical history. If they are, what
   is "Patmos" the symbol of?  And how can a Place be a symbol of Time?
   When one thing is used as a symbol of another, there is always
   something common to both, by which the Symbol is connected with the
   thing symbolised. Besides, at the best, it is only a theory which had
   its origin in the mind of some good man. We prefer to believe (1) that
   the book was sent to these Assemblies at that time for them to read and
   hear and keep in mind; (2) that to us also now there is an application,
   so far as it accords with what is specially written as to our standing
   in Christ in the Pauline Epistles, and we may read and keep these words
   in mind, so that we, too, may receive the promised blessing; but (3) as
   there will be a People gathered in Assemblies or Synagogues on the
   earth all through the Day of the Lord and after the Church has been
   caught up (this is clear from xii. 1 7; xiii. 1O; xiv. 12), this book,
   therefore, will have its final and special interpretation for them.
   They will receive the blessing; and these Epistles will be exhausted by
   the interpretation they will then receive. Thus understanding these
   Assemblies, we rob no one, and deprive no one, of the blessing of verse
   3. We have already made some remarks on this point, and shall have more
   to say when we come to the Epistles themselves.

   Advent.

   The Vision of the Coming One.

   12. And I turned to see the Voice which was speaking with me]     Here
   we have two Figures-- (1) Metonomy of the effect, by which the "voice"
   is put for the person speaking; and (2) this, when used with the verb
   "to see," produces the figure Catachresis (or Incongruity), as a voice
   cannot be seen. These Figures properly rendered mean, "and I turned to
   see Him who spake with me."

   and, on turning, I saw seven lamp-stands of gold]     They were
   realities that John saw, but realities used as symbols; and what they
   are symbolical of we are told in verse 20. That they were real in
   Heaven is clear from Heb. viii. 2, 5; ix. 23. But they are significant
   of things below. These seven lamp stands point us to the seven-fold
   golden lamp-stand of the Tabernacle.    Ex. xxv. 31, 32, 37; xxxvii.
   23.   Heb. ix. 2.   Then, there was but one lamp-stand: here, there are
   seven. There, Israel was one, and was gathered as one nation: here,
   that nation is scattered and in its Dispersion. The same fact explains
   the absence of the table of Shew-bread.

   13. and in the midst of the seven [88] lamp-stands One like a son of
   man]    i.e., by a Hebraism, a human being, viz., the Son of Man
   Himself.  The title emphasizes the human nature of Him who thus appears
   to John. For its significance in relation to this book and its
   interpretation see above, and compare Dan. vii. 31.  Ezek. i. 26;
   viii. 2.

   We now come to the Vision proper, and present the Expansion of the
   member

   The Vision itself, as we have seen above, is parallel with the vision
   Daniel saw (Dan. x.); and its object is the same (as there stated). "I
   am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the
   latter days."  Then, it was added," for yet the vision is for many
   days."  Now, the many days have passed, and "the time is at hand " (i.
   3). The Day of the Lord is to be revealed to John. We need not enlarge
   or dwell upon the various aspects of the vision.

   clothed with a robe reaching to the feet, and girt about the breasts
   with a girdle or gold:  14. His head and hair white, as white wool--as
   snow (Dan. vii. 9.) and His eyes as a flame of fire; 15.and His feet
   like unto polished brass (Ezek. i. 7) glowing as in a furnace; and His
   voice as the voice of many waters.]    This is a common Old Testament
   simile, see Ezek. i. 24; xliii. 2.   So Rev. xiv. 2; xix. 6.   The
   comparison is, of course, the noise made by the waves of the sea upon
   the shore.

   16. And having seven stars in His right hand; and out of His mouth a
   sharp two-edged sword going forth]    A like Figure is used of men (Ps.
   iv. 21; vii. 4; lix. 7). What is signified by it is clear from Isa. xi.
   4; xlix. 2, and 2 Thess. ii. 8.  The Divine comment on it is in Rom.
   xiii. 4.  Compare Matt. xxiv. 50, 51.  Luke xii. 46.   The sword is
   referred to again in chap. ii. 12, 16; and its final purpose is shown
   in xix. 15, 21.   Luke xix. 27.

   and His countenance was as when the sun shineth in his strength.]

   Salutation.

   17. And, when I had seen Him, I fell at His feet as dead: and He laid
   His right hand upon me, saying, [89] Fear not.]

   Jesus Testifying of Himself.

       E^^4a^^4 | q | -17, 18-.  Life.   "I am the First and the Last, and
   the Living One.
                       r | -18-.  Death.  "I was dead indeed;

                       r | 18.  Death.  "And I have the keys of Death and
   the Grave."


   -17. I am the First and the Last]    Compare Is. xli. 4; xliii. 10;
   xliv. 6; xlviii. 11, 12.  The pronoun is emphatic, marking the
   commencement of a new member.

   18. and the Living One]    See above for the significance of this
   title.  (...), Josh. iii. 10,  the living God.

   I was dead, indeed, yet behold! I am living for ever and ever [90] ]
     We must keep our translation English, otherwise the Greek is,
   literally, 'I came to be (as in verses 9 and 10) dead, and behold I am
   living,' &c.   The words "I live" are very emphatic, marking the
   speaker as being the fountain and giver of life.

   and I have the keys of Death and the Grave [91] ]    Greeks, (...)
   (Hades). There is no occasion to introduce any idea of "souls" or of an
   "intermediate state," so-called, here.  "Death and the Grave" is a
   comprehensive expression which explains itself. We translate it
   "grave," as the A.V. is compelled to render it in xx. 13 (marg.) and I
   Cor. xv. 55.  The R. V. transliterates in i.19 and xx. 13 "Hades"; and
   in I Cor. xv. 55 reads "death" instead.


   E^^4 b^^4; i. 19.
   The Things Testified.

   19. Write therefore [92] what things thou sawest and what they are]
   So Alford and Rotherham and others: i.e., "what they signify "
   (Stuart). This is the sense of (...) (eisin), are.   It is so rendered
   twice in the very next verse; and elsewhere very frequently (e.g.,
   Matt. xiii. 37 and 39. Rev. xvii. 9, 15, 18, etc.).

   even what things are about to happen hereafter]    This is not the same
   expression as in verse 1. There, it was necessity, "must come to
   pass";  here, it is sequence, "about to come to pass."

   The command to write refers to all that John saw, and not merely what
   he had seen in verses 12-16. We must remember that the Introduction was
   written last, as we have shown above.

   The translation "What they are (or signify)" is so undoubtedly good
   that it seems rather insecure to base a whole system of interpretation
   affecting the whole book, on the common rendering--"the things which
   are."   Our readers may be aware that many books on the Apocalypse base
   their whole system of interpretation on this rendering.  But surely
   such a far-reaching system ought to have a firmer foundation on which
   to rest.

   This, in itself, is slight enough:  but, when chaps. ii. and iii. are
   nowhere spoken of as being "the things which are," we have not
   sufficient warrant to adopt an interpretation of the book which rests
   on such hypothetical grounds.

   That these Epistles are addressed to those who shall be on the earth
   during the Day of the Lord, may be seen by comparing many expressions
   contained in them with the actual scenes and circumstances described in
   various parts of the Book.

   Compare

   ii.3.

   Interpretation.

   -20. The seven stars are]    i.e., signify or represent (as in the
   previous verse). This is always the meaning of the Figure called
   Metaphor which we have here.

   the angels of the seven Assemblies; and the seven lamp-stands [93] are
   (i.e., signify) the seven Assemblies]    Who shall authorize us to
   understand the word "angels" as having any connection with the Church
   of God?  No one ever heard (until quite recent times) of such a title
   being given to any church-officer either in Scripture, in history, or
   in tradition. To take the word "angel" as meaning "bishop," in the
   absence of any evidence of any kind, is one of the vagaries of
   interpretation from which the Apocalypse has so long suffered. But this
   brings us to the consideration of the seven Epistles themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] We give a list of all the occurrences of the word, with its
   renderings [in the section VII. The Title of the Book], so that our
   readers may be able to judge for themselves what is the sense in each
   passage. It is rendered revelation in Rom. ii. 5; xvi. 25. I Cor. xiv.
   6, 26. 2 Cor. xii. 1, 7. Gal. i. 12; ii. 2. Eph. i. 17; iii. 3. 1 Pet.
   i. 13. Rev. i. 1.

   [69] The word occurs in this book eight times, viz., i. 1; iv. 1; xvii.
   1; xxi. 9, 10; xxii. 1, 6, 8.

   [70] {Footnote missing in our digitized original --CCEL}

   [71] Thus, "Lampstands" are explained for us as representing
   assemblies; "Stars," angels of the assemblies; "Torches," spirits;
   "Horns" and "Eyes," spirits; "Incense odours," prayers of saints;
   "Dragon," Satan; "Frogs," unclean spirits; "Wild Beast," a king
   (xvii.); "Heads" of the Wild Beast, mountains and kings; "Horns,"
   kings; "Waters," peoples; "Woman," a city; "Fine linen," righteous
   awards; "City of God," Bride of the Lamb.

   [72] See also "unclean spirits," Matt. x. 1; xii. 43. Mark i. 23, 26,

   "loosed," or "freed."

   [75] It is the figure Metalepsis (see Figures of Speech, page 611), by
   which "blood" is first put for death, and then death put for Christ's
   atoning merits.

   [76] Here we have the correct translation of Zech. xii. 10, while the
   Septuagint gives it incorrectly.

   brackets, as being doubtful.

   [89] All the Critical Texts and R.V. omit "unto me."

   [90] All the Critical Texts and R. V. omit "Amen."

   [91] The order of these words is thus reversed by the Critical Texts

   [92] The word (...) (oun) therefore, is to be added here according to
   all the Critical Greek Texts and R.V.

   [93] All the Critical Greek Texts and R.V. omit "which thou sawest."

                     The People on the Earth: Chapters 2-3

   We now come to chapters ii. and iii.:  which will find their true
   interpretation and fulfilment when used for special instruction by the
   people on the Earth during the Day of the Lord; by Israel, and
   especially by the Remnant.

   We have said enough on this point already, to make this sufficiently
   clear.

   We shall note, in these Epistles, constant references to the condition
   of things as described in this book. References which cannot be
   explained either by Church History or tradition; but which are quite
   simple and clear when read in the light of future history, as
   prophetically recorded in the Apocalypse.

   The difference between these Epistles and all other Epistles in the New
   Testament is so great, that one wonders how it was possible for them
   ever to be supposed as being addressed to the Church of God, the
   members of the Body of Christ!  If it were not that we have all been
   brought up from earliest infancy to believe it, we could never have
   taken them as having anything in common with those addressed in either
   the earlier or later Pauline Epistles.

   Everything is different: Circumstances, standpoint, references to the
   Old Testament, terminology, phraseology, scope, style: everything
   points to a different order of things altogether; yea, to a different
   Dispensation.

   There is nothing in them about Christianity as such; nothing of our
   standing in Christ; nothing that can be taken, even by application, as
   referring to our present position as being in Christ; perfect, and
   complete in Him. Nothing about the "no condemnation," or no separation
   of Rom. viii.  But all is warning or reproof.   Promises are made only
   to the "overcomer," and to those who shall "endure unto the end."  It
   is clear that those who are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in
   the heavenlies in Christ" (Eph. i. 3) cannot be those to whom these
   seven Epistles are addressed. They are written to those who are under a
   covenant of works, and not to those who are under the covenant of
   grace. And those who interpret them of the church of God now must
   greatly lower that standing which He has given them in Christ, or else
   be altogether ignorant of it.

   No!  we keep our own truth as written to the churches by the Holy
   Spirit through Paul; and leave that which is equally truth written to
   other and different Assemblies by Christ through John. It is so very
   improbable that the covenant of works under which these Assemblies are
   addressed could co-exist, at one and the same time, with those under
   the covenant of grace, that we seem to be shut up to a future
   interpretation; when all these expressions, and references, and
   warnings and threatenings, and promises (of which history knows
   nothing), shall find their fulfilment and reach their end.

   Further comments may be left to be made as we consider the words of the
   Epistles themselves.

   First, note the structure of the seven Epistles as a whole, and the
   seven lessons based on the seven stages of Israel's history. This
   separates them into 3 and 4; the numbers into which 7 is always
   divided.

   In the first three Epistles the references are to Israel's history, as
   recorded in the Old Testament, and are from the period when Israel was
   in the Wilderness. All Israel is included.

   In the last four Epistles the references are to the period when the
   people were in the Land, and Israel and Judah are mentioned
   alternately.


   THE SEVEN EPISTLES AS A WHOLE.
   (chaps. ii and iii.)

   The Wilderness.

   X | 1 | Ephesus.     Israel's Epousals.
               2 | Smyrna.    Israel's Testing.
                     3 | Pergamos.    Israel's Failure.

   The Land.

   Y | 4 | Thyatira.    The Day of Israel's Kings.
                   5 | Sardis.    Israel's Removal.
         6 | Philadelphia.    The Day of Judah's Kings.
                   7 | Laodicea.    Judah's Removal.


   Failure is the great subject; and the causes which led to that failure.
   This is the basis of the great lesson which will be needed for another
   time of Trial, Testing, and Tribulation; which will end, not in
   failure, but in glory.

   This division into three and four is further marked by the injunction
   and the promise with which each of the seven Epistles closes.

   In the first three, which refer to the Wilderness, the Promise follows
   the Injunction; while in the last four which refer to the Land, the
   order is reversed, and the Injunction follows the Promise.

   We now proceed to look at each of these seven Epistles separately.


   I. THE FIRST EPISTLE.--EPHESUS.
   (ii. 1-7.)

   Each Epistle, though the structure itself varies, is based upon the
   same general plan, viz.: The Introduction, consisting of Christ's
   command to John to write, with an appropriate attribute taken from the
   previous vision in chap. i.  The Conclusion, consisting of Christ's
   command to him that hath an ear, to hear; with His promise, fulfilled
   in the latter portion of the book. Between these we have the
   subject-matter of the Epistle proper. While this general arrangement is
   common to all these Epistles, yet each has its own peculiar exhibition
   of it.

   The correspondences and contrasts between the Epistles are worthy of
   note, forming a useful guide to their inter-relation. They show us what
   are the important points which we should notice; and what are the
   matters on which we should place special emphasis.

   In short, they give us the peculiar scope of and key to each Epistle
   respectively; and though not essential to the reader's studies, they
   are worthy of his close attention.

   (I) TRANSLATION OF THE FIRST EPISTLE (ii. I-7).
   EPHESUS.

   ii. 1. To the angel]    As we have said above, this is the Shelach
   Tzibbur of the Synagogue, the presiding minister. A title well
   understood by Jewish readers, but quite foreign to Gentile ears.

   of the Assembly]    As in Acts xix. 32, 39, 41.   Or Synagogue.  The
   A.V. renders the Greek Synagogue in Jas. ii. 2 "Assembly" instead of
   Synagogue; and in Jas. v. 14 "Church" instead of Assembly. The former
   passage (ii. 2) shows what the nature of the Assembly was in chap. v.
   14. It was the congregation assembling in the Synagogue, and there is
   no reason why it should not be so taken in Rev. ii. and iii.

   in [94] Ephesus, write]    No one can put this Epistle by the side of
   that of Paul to the Ephesians and think for a moment that it can be the
   same Assembly that is addressed. It is not a matter of argument or of
   opinion; it is a matter of fact. Read the two Epistles, one after the
   other, and note the standing of grace in the one, and the standing of
   works in the other. It is true John wrote some years later than Paul;
   but though this might affect the condition of the Assembly, it could
   not change the ground of God's dealings. His covenant had not changed.
   But here, everything is changed, as we shall see. In Paul's Epistle to
   the Church of God in Ephesus, God speaks to those who are all of them
   on the highest ground of privilege and of grace. Here, there is no
   blessing at all, except to the overcomers.

   These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand
   (i. 16), He that walketh in the midst of the seven lamp-stands of gold
   (i. 13)]    Here the reference is surely to Deut. xxiii. 14, where this
   walking, and the object of it, are the same as in the Day of the Lord.
   "For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee,
   and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be
   holy; that He see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee."
   Here, Christ thus walks according to Lev. xxvi. 12.   And his eye sees
   and exposes the unclean things in the camp of these Assemblies.

   2. I know thy works]    This is the principle on which the Lord will
   deal with the Remnant of Israel in the Day of the Lord.  See Isa. ixvi.
   18:  "For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I
   will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall see My glory."  The
   context in the previous verses (15-17) shows the nature of these
   "works" and the time of the Lord's dealing with them. Most of the seven
   Epistles begin with the statement of this fact, as to "works," from
   Isa. ixvi. 18.

   and [95] labour, and thy endurance]    or patience (ii. 3).   This is
   the patience referred to in xiii. 10: "Here is the patience and faith
   of the saints";  xiv. 12: "Here is the patience of the saints; here are
   they that keep the commandments (the 'works' spoken of) of God, and the
   faith of Jesus." The statement in this Epistle refers to the then
   condition of things in the Day when the things written in this Book
   shall be fulfilled.

   and that thou canst not bear wicked (or, evil) men; and thou didst try
   those who call themselves apostles, and are not, and didst find them
   liars:

   3. And thou hast endurance, and didst bear [96] for the sake of my
   name, and hast not wearied [97]

   4. Nevertheless I have this against thee, that thou hast left thy first
   love]     This is very emphatic. Lit., it is "thy love--thy first
   love."  What have we here but a reference to Jer. ii. 1, 2, where God
   commanded Jeremiah to commence his prophecy by calling this fact to
   their remembrance: "Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus
   saith the Lord: I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of
   thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness." This
   was the day referred to in Ezek. xvi. 8-10, etc.:  the day when Jehovah
   set His love upon them and chose them, not because of their number,
   "but because the LORD loved you" (Deut. vii. 7-9). See above, under the
   expression in i. 5, "unto him who loveth us."

   5. Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen, and repent]     This is
   strange language if it be addressed to those who had been "blessed with
   all spiritual blessings, in the heavenlies, in Christ" (Eph. i. 3).
   Nothing could forfeit such blessings; because they are in the
   heavenlies, in Christ, whence none can touch them or pluck them. Nor
   can repentance procure them, for they are the gift of God to His
   church; and His gifts and calling are without repentance (Rom. xi. 29).
   No; the Assembly to whom such words are addressed cannot be the
   Assembly addressed by the Holy Spirit through Paul.

   and do the first works; otherwise (Lit., but if not)I am coming to
   thee, [98] and will remove thy lamp-stand out of its place, except thou
   repent]     He had come before, at His first Advent, seeking fruit. But
   He found it not. Now He is coming again, and the cry goes forth once
   more, "Repent "; for, He who is coming is at hand. Repentance is 'the
   first work.'  It is the one condition of national blessing for Israel.
   It is the essence of the proclamation of the King and the Kingdom. The
   ministries of John the Baptist (Matt. iii. 2), of Christ Himself (Matt.
   iv. 17), and also of Peter (Acts ii. 38; iii. 39), were all stamped
   with this one word "Repent."  This is the "first work" to be done, the
   first step to be taken in view of national blessing. See Lev. xxvi.
   40-42.   I Kings viii. 33, 35, 37.    Deut. xxx. 1-3.   Dan. ix. 3, 4.
       Zech i. 3; etc.

   6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes,
   which I also hate]    The Nicolaitanes are mentioned again in verse 15.
   History knows nothing definite of any people bearing such a name during
   the primitive age of Christianity. Tradition has something to say; but
   this is so conflicting and so uncertain, that most commentators attempt
   to solve the difficulty by considering the name as being symbolical (as
   they do that of Balaam (ii. 14, 15), and Jezebel (ii. 20). They
   interpret it by its etymology-- (...) (nikos) conqueror and (...)
   (laos) people. If there be anything in this, it is better to leave it
   to "that day," when events will make its meaning manifest.

   7. He that hath an ear, let him hear]    None but the Lord Jesus ever
   used this formula. On fourteen occasions He used it. Always, when He
   was speaking of the great change in the Dispensation which was about to
   take place. It is connected therefore with Dispensational truth. Six
   times (the number of man) in the Gospels He used it as the Son of Man;
   and eight times (the Dominical Number) in Revelation, as the risen Lord
   speaking from heaven: here, at the close of each of these seven
   Epistles, and once in chap. xiii. 9. [99]

   what the Spirit saith (or is saying) to the Assemblies]     In Rev.
   xix. 10 we are told that "the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of
   prophecy"; i.e., it is the prophetic testimony spoken by Christ
   Himself; or the testimony spoken by His servant John, or by angelic
   messengers concerning Him who addresses these Assemblies in this Book.

   To him that overcometh]    This is language wholly foreign to the
   Epistles written to believers by Paul. The members of Christ's Body
   have already overcome all "in Him."  They are already "more than
   conquerors through him that loved us" (Rom. viii. 37). The same John
   speaks, in his Epistle, of those who belong to the Church of God as
   having already overcome (See I John ii. 13; iv. 4; v. 4, 5). Those who
   are addressed here will be living in the days of the Beast, in the
   midst of the great Tribulations and there will be those who will
   "endure unto the end."  Of some we read "the Beast...shall make war
   against them, and shall overcome them and kill them" (xi. 7).  Of
   others it is said is they overcame him (the accuser of their brethren)
   by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they
   loved not their lives unto the death" (xii. 11).  Of others again, "It
   was given unto him (the Beast) to make war with the saints and to
   overcome them" (xiii. 7).  Hence the reiteration of the final promise
   in xxi. 7, "he that overcometh shall inherit all things." The
   Revelation is full of overcoming. No less than sixteen times we have
   the verb (...) (nikao), to conquer, or overcome. The overcomers who are
   addressed at the close of each of these seven Epistles will be living
   in the days referred to in these passages. They will be special
   overcomers of a specific form of evil. They are thus prophesied of in
   Isa. lxvi. 5: "Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word:
   Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake,
   said Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and
   they shall be ashamed." They are spoken of in Dan. xi. 32 as those who
   "do know their God, shall be strong and do exploits."  In Matt. xxiv.
   13, as those who "shall endure unto the end." Compare Matt. x. 22.

   will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the [100] Paradise
   of God]    For the promises of the seven Epistles as a whole, see
   [[1]The Promises to the Seven Assemblies]. This first promise is
   fulfilled in xxii. 14, where the article "the tree of life" is used,
   and refers specially to the overcomers. The Tree mentioned in verse 2
   and Ezek. xlvii. 12 is another tree or trees (without the article)
   intended for the healing of the nations during the millennium.

   The promise, here, refers to the New Earth, when the curse will be
   removed, and the whole Earth be restored as the Paradise of God. To
   this "Paradise" Paul was caught away (2 Cor. xii. 4); and also to this
   "third Heaven" (and Earth).

   The first was overflowed with water and perished (2 Pet. iii. 6 and
   Gen. i. 2).

   The second Heavens and Earth are those "which are now" (2 Pet. iii. 7),
   and which will be purged by fire (2 Pet. iii. 10).

   The third are those for which we look, even the New Heavens and the New
   Earth (Paradise restored) (2 Pet. iii. 13 and Rev. xxi., xxii.).

   To this third heaven and Paradise was Paul caught away in vision. These
   John also saw; and was commissioned to write what Paul was unable to
   utter. This Paradise of the New Earth, which will characterize the
   Kingdom, was referred to by the Lord Jesus in His answer to the dying
   thief "Lord, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom."   "Verily, I
   say unto thee to-day, (i.e., on this day of shame and death, beyond
   which thou seest by the eye of faith) thou shalt be with me in
   Paradise." That promise will be fulfilled to him as an overcomer.  His
   faith overcame all his circumstances; and he marvellously believed, in
   spite of all the awful scenes of that day, that Jesus was "Lord," and
   that He would yet come in his Kingdom. To him, therefore, as an
   overcomer, was the promise of that future Paradise given; as here it is
   given to all who shall overcome by the same faith.


   2. THE SECOND EPISTLE.-- SMYRNA.
   (ii. 8-11.)

   The Second Epistle was addressed to the angel of the Assembly in
   Smyrna.

   It is marked by a definite period of trial being mentioned, viz., "ten
   days," and answers to the second stage of Israel's history, which was
   marked by a definite period of trial--"forty years."   The first
   Epistle (Ephesus) began with a reference to the day of Israel's
   Espousals, and reminds those people of their "first love."  The second
   (Smyrna), in its definite days of trial, reminds us of the definite
   period of forty years in the wilderness.

   Its structure is as simple and clear as it is beautiful.


   (2) ii. 8-11.  Smyrna

   Introduction

                                           c | -10.  Encouragement.  "Be
   thou"...

      Conclusion
      a | d | 11-.  Christ's command to assemblies to hear.
                     e | -11.  Christ's promise.  No second death.
   Compare xx. 6, 14.


   8. And unto the angel of the Assembly in Smyrna write; These things
   saith the First and the Last]    This, as we have already seen, is one
   of the Titles used in the Introduction (i. 17); as it is used in the
   Old Testament, of Deity.   (Isa. xli. 4; xliv. 6; xlviii. 12.).

   who was (lit., became) dead, and returned to life]     (i. 17, 18) The
   verb (...) (ezesen) means more than merely to live or to be alive.
   (See Rom. xiv. 9.   Rev. xiii. 14 (where it is used of and throws light
   upon the Beast being raised);   xx. 4, 5).  It means to live again in
   resurrection life. See John iv. 50.   Mark xvi. 11.

   9. I know [101] thy tribulation, and thy poverty]     This is the
   outcome of xiii. 16, 17, for when they will not be allowed by the Beast
   to buy or sell, great poverty must necessarily ensue.

   nevertheless thou art rich]    Poor in one sense, yet rich in another
   sense.

   and I know the blasphemy coming from those who say that they themselves
   are Jews, and they are not, but are Satan's synagogue]     When have
   people ever professed to be Jews in order to join a Christian church?
   Such an anomaly was never heard of.  These words alone are sufficient
   to prove the true Jewish character of these assemblies. Words have no
   meaning if this verse does not speak concerning those who, for some
   reason or other (perhaps in order to betray, hardly for gain or
   advantage), hypocritically affirmed that they were Jews when they were
   not.

   10. Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: lo, the devil
   is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye
   shall have tribulation ten days]    What trial and tribulation is this,
   if not exactly that foretold by the Lord in Matt. x. 22?  "And ye shall
   be hated of all men for my name's sake; but he that endureth to the end
   shall be saved."  Compare Matt. xxiv. 9, 10, and John xvi. 1-4.  In
   these passages the very trials are mentioned; and in Rev. xiii. 5-7 we
   see the very circumstances described, in which those who are thus
   addressed will be placed. In this special case the tribulation is
   limited to "ten days."  And why not?  Why should we seek to make these
   words mean other than what they say?  In Est. iii. 13 a decree went
   forth that the whole nation was to be destroyed "in one day."  Why
   should not such a decree go forth again for "ten days"? Even in our own
   times we read of Jews in Russia, Roumania, and elsewhere, being given
   over for days together to the violence of a persecuting mob. Why should
   not these "ten days" refer to a certain definite and limited time of
   trouble?  Why introduce endless difficulties into this Book by always
   maintaining that God means something quite different from what He
   says?  Moses Stuart is an example. He writes: "Let the reader mark well
   the symbolic use of number in this case; for the exact literal one will
   be insisted on, I trust, by no one."

   His trust is vain, for we do insist on believing that God means what He
   says. If we are wrong in this, then we prefer to be found wrong,
   hereafter, in this simplicity of faith, rather than to be reproved by
   God for having, in preference, believed man. When God says (Gen. vii.
   4):  "For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
   forty days and forty nights," God meant days, not years. See verse 10:
   "And it came to pass after seven days"; and see verse 12.  When Joseph
   said, by the prophetic spirit, "The three branches are three days.  Yet
   within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head," he meant "days,"
   not years; for we read: "And it came to pass the third day," etc.;  see
   Gen. xl. 12, 13, 20.   So with the wandering in the wilderness, Num.
   xiv. 33;  "forty days" means forty days, and "forty years" means forty
   years.  So with Jonah; and the Lord, Matt. xii. 40.  So with Ezekiel,
   iv. 1-8.

   be (lit., become) thou faithful unto death]     Probably violent death
   is meant.

   and I will give to thee the crown of life]    Here we have not the
   standing of the church "in Christ."  That standing does not depend on
   our faithfulness but on the faithfulness of Him who has already given
   us life in Himself -- eternal life. This life rests on no conditions
   but upon the unalterable gift of God in Christ. Compare the Epistle
   addressed "to the twelve Tribes," Jas. i. 1.  The faithfulness
   mentioned here refers to that which is the subject of xx. 4.

   1l. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the
   Assemblies.  He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death]
       This is mentioned again in xx. 6, 14, and xxi. 8, as the fulfilment
   of this promise in those who have passed through the great Tribulation
   and have not worshipped the Beast nor received his mark. Those who are
   faithful unto death, and die of a violent death, then, for Christ's
   sake, are promised that they "shall not be hurt of the second death,"
   which shall finally destroy their enemies.

   Note how the titles of Christ in verse 8 ("I am He that was dead and
   returned to life") agree with the exhortation of verse 10 ("be thou
   faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life"), and the
   promise of verse 11 ("shall not be hurt of the second death").


   3. THE THIRD EPISTLE.--PERGAMOS.
   (ii. 12-17.)

   In the Epistle to the Assembly in Pergamos, the Old Testament
   illustrations are from a subsequent period of Israel's wilderness
   experiences. Balaam and Balak are used to illustrate the special
   circumstances of this Assembly; the counterpart of which will be found
   to exist in "the day of the Lord."

   It is the last of the three Epistles in which the Old Testament
   reference is to Israel and the Wilderness period. In the first we had
   Israel's Espousals;   in the second we had Israel's Testing and Trial;
   now, here, in the third, we have Israel's Failure.

   This failure is very marked in the Epistle to Pergamos.  The
   predominant tone of the Epistle is that of Crimination. Two solemn
   warnings are given, and a call to "Repent," with a threat of being
   fought against by the sword of His mouth.

   This will be seen in the Epistle as we proceed; and it is clearly
   exhibited in the Structure:--


   (3) ii. 12-17.  Pergamos.

   Introduction
   (3) a | c | 12-.  Christ's command to write.
                   d | -12.  Christ's attribute. (i. 16.)

                       Commendation
                       b | e | 13-.  Works.  General.
                               f | -13-.  Place.  (...)
                            e | -13-.  Works.  Particular.
                               f | -13.  Place. (...)

                                    Reproof
                                    g | 14-.  Crimination.  "I have
   against thee," &c.
                                           h | i | -14-.  Balaam. (...)
                                                   k | -14.  Description.
   "Who taught," &c.
                                           h | i | 15-.  Nicolaitanes.
   (...)
                                                   k | -15.  Description.
   "In like manner," &c.
                                    g | 16.  Warning.  "Repent; or I will
   come," &c.

          Conclusion
           | c | 17-.  Christ's command to assemblies to hear
                   d | -17.  Christ's promise.  "Manna."  "New Name."
   (Compare vii. 13-17; xix. 12.)


   ii. 12. And unto the angel of the Assembly in Pergamos, write; These
   things saith he who hath the sharp two-edged sword]    This attribute
   of Christ is taken from i. 16.  It is used here and in the closing
   threat of the Epistle (ii. 16), because the judgment upon "the error of
   Balaam" was executed with the sword.  See Num. xxxi. 8, "Balaam also,
   the son of Beor, they slew with the sword " (So Josh. xiii. 22).  Hence
   all the significant references to the "sword" in this epistle.  In i.
   16 the sword proceeds out of Christ's mouth, teaching them how, by the
   word which cometh out of His mouth, He can chastise and destroy.
   Hearken therefore to Him.

   13. I know [102] where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is]
   Here we have a special reference to the scenes and circumstances of
   Rev. xiii. 2, where the Dragon gave the Beast "his power, and his
   throne, and great authority."  In Rev. xvi. 10, "the fifth angel poured
   out his vial upon the throne of the Beast," &c. So that at that time,
   in the Day of the Lord, there will be a special place where Satan's
   throne will be set up in this world; and when he and the Beast will
   receive that worship which it is and has ever been his aim, all
   through, to obtain from mankind. This throne is evidently to be in
   Pergamos. Whatever foreshadowings there may have been of this in past
   history or in the history of the Roman Emperors, it only shows us the
   possibility of that, in which all believe when we speak of   "history
   repeating itself."  Pergamos was the seat of the ancient mysteries.
   That which has been, may be again. Just as the deeds of Antiochus
   Epiphanes show us how another individual will yet do entirely, what he
   did partially.

   and thou holdest fast my name]    in not receiving the mark of the
   Beast.   See Rev. xi. 18 ("which fear thy name"); and compare xiii.
   13-15.   2 Thes. ii. 11, 12.

   and didst not deny my faith, [even] [103] in the days [104] of Antipas,
   my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan
   dwelleth]     Here is another allusion to Satan's future special
   presence on the earth in the days here referred to. History knows
   nothing whatever about any such person named Antipas. Later tradition
   has a great deal to say, but its conflicting statements will not repay
   us for the time and trouble involved in their consideration. There will
   be many martyrs in those days; and here, one of them is mentioned by
   name. Compare and see Rev. vi. 9, 10;  xiii. 10; xx. 4, when the
   fulfilment of the Lord's words will be understood.   Matt. xxiv. 9.
   Mark xiii. 9.  Luke xxi. 12.     John xv. 20; xvi. 2.   These are the
   days specially referred to in this Epistle. It is no new thing for
   prophecy to name a person long before his personal manifestation (See I
   Kings xiii. 2. Isa xliv. 28; xlv. 1).  "The place where Satan dwelleth"
   (xiii. 2; xvi. 10) must be the place where persecution will rage most
   fiercely.

   14. Nevertheless I have against thee a few things, that thou hast there
   those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a
   stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed
   unto idols, and to commit fornication]     What "the error of Balaam"
   (Jude 11) was may be seen from Numbers xxv. 1, &c., and xxxi. 16, &c.
   The whole scene has to do with idolatry of the grossest kind, where
   fornication will be made religion! and when religion will be turned
   into fornication, as it was and is in all the great heathen systems of
   idolatry. This was the essence of idolatry of old; and this is what is
   again coming on the earth. Otherwise, what mean those significant words
   in chap. ix. 20, 21? (See [[2]Pergamos -- The Wilderness Period])

   15. So hast thou also those that hold fast the teaching of the
   Nicolaitanes (v. 6) in like manner [105] ]

   16. Repent therefore [106] ; otherwise I will come unto thee speedily,
   and will fight against them with the sword (v. 12) of my mouth]    We
   have seen before, how foreign is such a warning and threat as addressed
   to the members of the Church of God to-day. On the other hand, we see
   the actual fulfilment of this threat in chap. xix. 11-21.

   17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the
   Assemblies: To him that overcometh will I give [107] of the hidden
   manna]     This promise follows in the order of Old Testament
   illustration. (1) To Ephesus it was the tree of life (Gen. ii.).  (2)
   To Smyrna it was not to be hurt of the second death (Gen. iii.).  Now,
   to Pergamos, it is the manna of Exod. xvi. 32-34. We have to remember
   how the false prophets and teachers were all fed at Jezebel's table (I
   Kings xviii. 19).  So all these false teachers will be supported by the
   State of which the Beast will be the head. The faithful remnant of the
   woman's seed will be again driven into the wilderness (xii. 13-17).
   How beautiful therefore to be thus reminded, just here, that God can
   spread a table (not Jezebel's) for them in that wilderness, as He did
   of old (Ps. lxxviii. 19), when "man did eat angels' food, and He sent
   them meat to the full" (Ps. lxxviii. 24, 25). It is in this connection
   that the promise of the manna is given. In Ex. xvi. 34, 35 we are told
   that the manna was specially given "until they came to a land
   inhabited."  Until then, God has "hidden manna" with which to support
   His people.

   and I will give unto him a white stone, and on the stone a new name
   written, which none knoweth save he that receiveth it.]    This new
   name for the new Israel is the subject of prophecy. Isa. lxii. 2 tells
   of the time when "Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth
   of the Lord shall name" (see also Isa. lxv. 15).  Rev. xix. 11-16 is
   the fulfilment of this promise. What that new name will be is not yet
   revealed, but its association with the "white stone" reminds us that as
   they will be "a kingdom of priests," so they will have the priestly
   signs as Aaron had (Ex. xxviii. 36, &c.). On the front of his mitre was
   a plate of gold "holy to the Lord." Here, instead of a plate of gold,
   they are to have a white stone, on which will be an inscription
   equivalent to Aaron's, with their new name: thus distinguishing them in
   a most emphatic way from those who will worship the Beast and receive
   his mark in their forehead.

   Those who will be on the earth in those days will thus be divided into
   two opposing parties: the party of the Beast, and that of the Lamb;
   each having its own distinctive mark or brand.


   4. THE FOURTH EPISTLE.-- THYATIRA.
   (ii. 18-29.)

   We now come to the last four of these seven Epistles. In the first
   three the Old Testament references are to the period of the Wilderness.
   In these last four the references are to the period of the Land: and
   Israel and Judah are placed alternately.

   Israel comes first; for, idolatry commenced in the Ten Tribes, and
   these were first removed from the Land. Judah followed, and was
   afterwards removed.

   The first of these four Epistles, therefore, gives the illustration
   from the great apostasy of Israel under Ahab and Jezebel.

   Few of us can realize what that apostasy was; or what was its character
   and extent. Jeroboam was the first who made Israel thus to sin, but it
   culminated under Ahab and Jezebel. Under these two, organized idolatry
   of the grossest kind became the religion of the State, as opposed to
   the true religion established in Jerusalem.  It had its own priesthood,
   so numerous and powerful that the prophet Elijah was specially raised
   up by God to do battle against them, and warn the people against the
   enormity of the evil. Yet again will Elijah perform a similar duty
   under more awful circumstances.

   The structure of this Epistle is elaborate, as were the workings of
   that apostasy. But it is also very clear and unmistakable.

   ii. 18. And unto the angel of the Assembly in Thyatira, write; These
   things saith the Son of God]    Here, for the first time, the speaker
   is directly named; as well as distinguished by an attribute. Both speak
   of Divine judgment, and of the Divine power which is necessary to
   execute that judgment, and to perform the promises given in this
   Epistle.

   who hath His eyes like a flame of fire]    To detect all evil and alarm
   the evil-doers. This is the attribute of i. 14, 15; repeated in xix.
   12.

   and His feet like unto polished brass]    This tells of coming
   judgment, when He will tread the wicked under his feet.  Isa. lxiii.
   1-6; xli. 25; xiv. 25.   See also Mal. iv. 3;  Dan. viii. 7, 10; and
   compare Micah iv 13.  Dan. vii. 19.   Deut. xxxiii. 25.   Job xl. 18.
     The fulfilment of all this is seen in chap. xix. 13-15.

   19. I know thy works, and thy love, and thyservice, and thy faith,
   [108] and thy patient-endurance, and thy last works to be more than the
   first]    It is a question of "works" here, as in all these Epistles;
   and also of patient endurance in the Tribulation.

   20. Nevertheless I have this against thee, [109] that thou lettest
   alone [110] the [111]   woman Jezebel, she herself a prophetess, and
   she teacheth and deceiveth my servants to commit fornication, and to
   eat things sacrificed to idols]    The reference here is to I Kings
   xvi. 30-34. All the evil is traced up to Jezebel (I Kings xxi. 25). The
   teaching is the same as that of Balaam, and of the Nicolaitanes--only
   it is more organized, and in the name of religion, and under the direct
   auspices of the State. Balaam was outside Israel; Jezebel is within.
   This is what it will be in the days of the Beast: and this is why these
   exhortations, teachings, and warnings are written in these Epistles. We
   do not comprehend them, because we are not living in those days;
   therefore, we cannot even apply them to ourselves. Three of the
   Assemblies are warned with regard to this evil. Ephesus (ii. 6);
   Pergamos (ii. 14, 15); and Thyatira (ii. 20).   And there is everything
   in the Apocalypse to show that that will be the special form of evil in
   the coming days of Antichrist on earth. See also 2 Kings ix. 22, 30.
   Jer. iv. 30.   Nah. iii. 4.

   21. And I gave her space in order that she might repent [112] and she
   willeth not to repent of her fornication]    We must read the history
   in the book of Kings in order to understand this; and see and note how
   it is connected with persecution.  See I Kings xviii. 13, 14.  It may
   have reference to the woman of Rev. xvii. 1-4, and to the scenes then
   going on in the earth. Compare chap. xviii. 3 and 8-l0). Also ix. 20,
   21.

   22. Lo! I cast her into a bed, and those who are committing adultery
   with her (xviii. 8-10) into great tribulation (Rom. ii. 8, 9, 16),
   except they repent of her [113] works]   The casting into a bed, here,
   is in contrast with Jezebel's being cast out of a window.  And it
   refers to a bed of anguish and of judgment. To reward and punish
   "according to works" is God's principle of dealing with Israel and the
   world (xviii. 6); but not with the Church.

   23. and her children (Ps. cxxxvii. 9) will I kill with death (i.e.,
   with pestilence); and all the assemblies shall know (or, get to
   know)that I am He that searcheth reins and hearts.] Compare Jer. xi.
   20; xvi 10; xx. 12.   I Kings viii. 59;  and I Sam. xvi. 7;  and see
   Rev. xi. 18 and xxii. 12.  This is the work of "the Son of God" (v.
   18). The word "death" here means pestilence, as in chap. vi. 8; xviii.
   8.    2 Sam. xxiv. 13.

   and will give unto you, each one, according to your works]     See Jer.
   xi. 20;  xvii. 10.   Ps. vii. 9;  lxii. 12.

   24. But, unto you, I say,--the rest [114] that are in Thyatira, as many
   as hold not this doctrine, who have not known (or, come to know)the
   depths of Satan, (as they say)]    God has His Divine depths, I Cor.
   ii. 10.   Rom. xi. 33.  But here we have the "depths of Satan." We see
   some of them in Rev. xiii., but the real "depths" are in turning the
   basest profligacy into religion; and, under the pretence of worshipping
   idols (which is awful enough), to legalize and patronise the lowest of
   vices. Read Isa. xxviii. 14-18.

   I do not [115] lay upon you any other burden]     or prophetic message
   of judgment.  See 2 Kings ix. 25, 26, and Isa. xiii. 1.

   25. Nevertheless, what ye have hold fast till I come (lit., shall have
   come).  26. And he that overcometh and keepeth my works]      i.e.,
   keepeth in mind, as to ponder over, and understand my judgments. See on
   the word "keep" chap. i. 3, and references there given.

   unto the end,--I will give him authority over the nations; 27.and he
   shall rule them with a rod of iron: as vessels of pottery are dashed in
   pieces: even as I also have received of my Father]    This is an
   unmistakable reference to such Old Testament prophecies as Ps. ii. 7-9,
   and to the scenes that will be then current on the earth mentioned in
   chaps. xii. 10, and xix. 15-21.

   To such straits are interpreters driven, who spiritualize the
   prophecies of the Old Testament, and thus rob them from those to whom
   they belong, that they hesitate not on most missionary platforms to
   quote Ps. ii. 7-9 of the spread of the gospel. But there is some
   inconsistency in this robbery, for while they quote and claim the words
   of verse 8, "Ask of me and I will give the heathen for thine
   inheritance," they always stop short, and do not go on to quote the
   words that follow--"Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron: and shalt
   dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Here is the asking and the
   giving spoken of in Ps. ii. 8, and in the verse before us: only here,
   the promise is to the Assembly in Thyatira. If this is the Church of
   God then here we have its mission. But though most commentators hold
   that Thyatira is a "church," they do not press this as the Church's
   mission, or "claim" this as its promise. This fact manifests the
   inconsistency of the popular principle of interpretation.

   28. And I will give unto him the morning star]    The promise is
   fulfilled in Rev. xxii. 16.  But the prophecy is in Numbers xxiv. 17,
   which connects it with Israel and with the day of the Lord's judgment,
   "there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
   Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the
   children of Sheth."

   29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the
   Assemblies]   See above.


   5.  THE FIFTH EPISTLE.--SARDIS.
   (iii. 1-6)

   In this Epistle the Old Testament reference is to the period of
   Israel's removal from the Land.  Where, as the separate kingdom of the
   Ten Tribes, her name is practically blotted out, as applied to the Ten
   Tribes.

   In Deut. xxix. God declares of those who shall turn away from Him "to
   go and serve the gods of these nations" (v. 18), that He will "blot out
   his name from under heaven (v. 20).

   This was fulfilled first in the case of the Ten-Tribed Kingdom of
   Israel. It was Jeroboam who first "made Israel to sin." He is known by
   this periphrasis. This is his special mark by which he was best known.
   In forming the Ten-Tribed Kingdom he was at once cut off from Jerusalem
   and the worship which God had established there. Religion of some kind
   must be the basis of government, so Jeroboam made his own religion: and
   in a yet future day the Beast will have his own universal religion; as
   we shall see.

   A similar warning, therefore, and a similar teaching, will be needed by
   those who shall be living on the earth in the days of which the
   Apocalypse treats.

   Hence we have in the epistle the reference to Israel's removal from the
   Land:--

       c | 6.  Christ's command to hear.


   iii. 1.  And unto the Angel of the Assembly in Sardis write; These
   things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God]   We submit that
   the Holy Spirit, as co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the
   Son, could not be properly spoken of as a possession of Christ; and
   placed on the same footing as the seven stars, "which are the angels of
   the seven assemblies."

   and the seven stars]   These are the angels of the seven assemblies,
   and are spoken of as belonging to Christ (equally with the seven
   spirits) to cast down, punish, remove or exalt as He will.  In chap. v.
   6 we read that "a Lamb stood as it had been slain, having seven horns
   and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God."  Indeed, these
   seven angels of the assemblies on earth, and the seven angels (or
   spirits, see under i. 4, and compare in Heb. i. 7) in heaven are
   connected together in the clearest possible manner.  When we read in
   this book of "the seven angels which stood before God" (viii. 2), and
   of the "seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are (or
   represent) the seven spirits of God," what are we to understand beyond
   this?  Why are we to say that they are not what it is here said they
   are, and explain them as being something else?  When Christ speaks of
   "having" these, it does not mean having them in possession as
   attributes, but having them in His power for use, disposal and command.

   I know thy works, that thou hast a name, that thou livest, and art
   dead]    How can such language as this be addressed to those who are in
   Christ today:   they have "no name to live."  They do live "in
   Christ."  Their standing is not in works; neither can it in any sense
   be said of them "and art dead."  On the contrary, they were once "dead
   in trespasses and sins," but they died in Christ, and are now risen in
   Him, and stand on resurrection ground before God in all the perfection
   of that standing which He has given them in Christ.  No one who knows
   anything of the teaching of the Church or Pauline Epistles, could ever
   think of sacrificing that wondrous standing for the sake of a false and
   traditional principle of interpretation.

   2. Be (lit., become) watchful, and strengthen the things that remain,
   that were [116] about to die: for I have not found thy works
   fulfilled]   or performed.

   The watchfulness required here is that of Luke xxi. 34-36.   Mark xiii.
   34-37.

   before my [117] God]   Compare I Sam. xvi. 7.   Seven times does Christ
   in these Epistles speak of "my" in connection with His "Father" and His
   "God."

   3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and keep it in
   mind, and repent]  What they heard we are told in Matt. xxiv. 14.

   If, therefore, thou shalt not watch, I will come [118] as a thief, and
   thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee]   This one passage
   settles, for ever, the fact that these words cannot possibly be
   addressed to the members of the Church of God who have "that blessed
   hope" of being caught up to meet the Lord in the air, or of being
   "called on high" as in Phil. iii. 14.   We are plainly and expressly
   told (in I Thess. v. 2), "yourselves know perfectly that 'the Day of
   the Lord' so cometh as a thief in the night.  For when they shall say
   'Peace and Safety'; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they
   shall not escape.  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day
   should overtake you as a thief."  No language can be plainer than this,
   addressed to "the Church of the Thessalonians."  Either Rev. iii. 3
   refers to believers now, and we have a flat contradiction of I Thess.
   v. 4, or we must rightly divide the Word of truth, and say that I
   Thess. v. 4 is true of all the members of the Church of God; and that
   Rev. iii. 3 is equally true of those who shall be in these Assemblies
   (whatever they may be) in "the day of the Lord."  That day will come
   "as a thief."   See Matt. xxiv. 43.   Luke xii. 39.   2 Pet. iii. 10.
     But it will come thus upon a world ("they" and "them") that looks not
   for Him.  The Church of God will be "called on high;" made like
   Christ's own glorious body (Phil. iii. 14, 20, 21), and received up in
   Glory (I Tim. iii. 16) before the thief shall come, and before the day
   of the Lord shall be present (2 Thess. ii. 2).  Hence we are exhorted
   not to be moved by reports that "the day of the Lord is now present"
   (R.V.).  If it were otherwise we have every need to be troubled, for
   our hope would then have been in vain.  Those who have not been caught
   away will indeed be troubled, for they will be in the Great
   Tribulation.  So determined, however, are many not to have this blessed
   hope, or even to allow others to have it, that they would rather hold
   that this "great and terrible day of the Lord" is our only "hope" and
   (!) thus be driven to interpret the "thief" of Christ coming as a
   friend to fetch us away as he steals precious jewels.  And this is done
   in the face of the opposite statement in I Thess. v. 4, that that day
   shall "not come as a thief" on the church; and in spite of the solemn
   warning to watch, so as not to suffer the thief to break into, or to
   break up the house (Matt. xxiv. 43).  This thief is to be watched
   against:  but Christ is to be watched for!

   4. Nevertheless thou hast a few names [119] in Sardis]    These names
   are evidently the distinguishing point in this Epistle, for we read in
   the next verse of names being not blotted out, and confessed.

   Which defiled not their garments]   This is language foreign to the
   Church of God.  It accords with a standing in the flesh as addressed to
   those who can wash their own robes (vii. 14) and establish a right to
   the tree of life (xxii. 14), and make themselves ready (xix. 7).  But
   all this is "works" and not grace.  So is the promise,

   and they shall walk with me in white: because they are worthy]    This
   promise is fulfilled in Rev. xix. 7, 8, but there is nothing like it in
   nature or character promised to or hoped for by the church.  And as to
   worthiness, who of use can take that standing?  No; we are altogether
   unworthy in ourselves, but all-worthy in Christ.  But these are worthy
   because of their own merit.  The scene contemplated here is actually
   described in chap. xvi. 15, and xix. 7-9.  The day of the Lord is a day
   when men will be treated according to their deeds (Rom. ii. 5, 6).
   Those who have not defiled their garments, and are unspotted from the
   flesh (Jude 5-8) are those who have not worshipped the Beast, or
   received his mark, or partaken of his idolatrous obscenities.

   5. He that overcometh shall thus [120] be arrayed in white garments;
   and I will not blot out his name from the book of life]   How is it
   possible for a true believer in Christ to have his name blotted out?
   The teaching of Rom. viii. as to our standing in Christ is the very
   opposite of this.   But both are true if "the word of truth" be rightly
   divided.  Dan. xii. 1 prophesies of this "book of life," and Rev. xiii.
   tells us that the time for its fulfilment shall have then come.

   and I will confess his name in the presence of my Father, and in the
   presence of His angels].   Here is the association of Christ, the
   Father, and the angels as in chap. i. 4-5.  See notes above; and Matt.
   xvi. 27.  This promise, [3]as we have seen, refers to the later scene
   in the life of David, when he confesses the names of his worthy ones,
   just before the glory of the kingdom is set up by Solomon (2 Sam.
   xxiii.).  Some of the names are "blotted out."  The others are
   confessed.  This is the scene alluded to here; and this is what is
   promised by the Lord in Matt. x. 32, Luke xii. 8 and Mark viii. 38.
   These words refer, as the Lord Himself explains, to the time when He
   comes to send the sword upon the earth (Matt. x. 33-42).  To interpret
   this of the church of God, is to utterly destroy that standing which
   God has given his church in Christ.   There is no condemnation for
   those who are in Christ; and there can be no separation from the love
   of God in Christ.   This is clear from Rom. viii.

   6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying unto the
   Assemblies]   see above.


   (6) THE SIXTH EPISTLE.-- PHILADELPHIA.
   (iii. 7-13.)

   In these last two Epistles the Old Testament illustrations are from the
   period of the Kings and Kingdom of Judah; and after the removal of
   Israel.  The one is from the days of Hezekiah; and the other is from
   the days of the Minor Prophets, before and after the return from
   Babylon, when hope of restoration was held out to the People.

   Those who will be on the earth in the days to which the Apocalypse
   refers, will need the instruction which such illustrations will give;
   for they will be days when all hope of restoration from man has gone,
   and the People can hope only in God.

   It will be a time of trial; but the promise of being kept in it is
   made, and the hope of being delivered out of it is given.

   Those who have this promise fulfilled in them are seen in chap. vii.
   and xiv. and xv. caught up to God and His throne.  They go into but
   come "out of" the Great Tribulation.  They are afterwards seen standing
   before the throne, though not seated as the Church will be with Christ
   upon the throne.  They will serve God and follow the Lamb whithersoever
   He goeth.  (See Rev. vii. 14-17; xiv. 1-5; xv. 1-4.)

   The structure exhibits these promises.  The time of trial has sifted
   and separated the people, and there are those now who have kept the
   words of this book in remembrance, to whom these promises can be made.

   iii. 7.  Unto the angel of the Assembly in Philadelphia, write; These
   things saith He that is holy and He that is true]   Seven attributes of
   Christ are here given.  The seven is divided, as usual, into three and
   four.  Three relate to what He is and hath:
    1. He that is holy.
    2. He that is true.
    3. He that hath the key of David.

   and four relate to what He does and does not do:
    1. He that openeth.
    2. And none shut.
    3. That shutteth.
    4. And none openeth.

   He that is holy]   or the Holy One, is a title of Deity (Hos. xi. 9
   Hab. iii. 3).  It is given to Christ (Ps. xvi. 10.    Acts. iii. 14).
   The usual form of this title in the Old Testament is "the Holy One of
   Israel"; but Israel is now removed, and the illustration is from Judah.

   He that is true]   The word here is (...) (alethinos) real, (not (...)
   (alethes) true), and denotes what is real and genuine in contrast to
   all that is merely typical.  Hence it is used of God whenever the
   reference or contrast is to idols (either latent otherwise) in the
   context.  (See I Thess. i. 9.   Compare  Jer. x. 10.   2 Chr. xv. 3.
   I John v. 20.   Rev. xix. 11).

   He that hath the key of David]   We have already referred to this, as
   specially giving its character to this Epistle.  It reminds the reader
   of that period of Judah's history described in Isa. xxii.  Jerusalem
   was about to be taken, and instead of repenting, they were feasting.
   The Treasurer of the State "who was over the house" (Shebna), carried
   the key in token of his office; and he presumptuously thought he was
   going to retain his office and his dignity, and finally be buried in
   the magnificent sepulchre he had prepared for himself in the rock.  But
   this thought was alien to the great hope given to David, which was
   resurrection, "even the sure mercies of (promised to) David."  Shebna
   entered not into David's spirit, so he was removed, and another
   (Eliakim) took his office.  The use of "the key of David" is explained
   in what follows, as denoting access to, and complete control over, the
   house and throne of David, and implies Regal dominion.   Hence the word
   "house" (used in the prophecy -- Isa. xxii. 22) is omitted here, for it
   is the throne that is now in question (Luke i. 32), and this could be
   occupied only in resurrection (Jer. xxx. 9.   Ezek. xxxiv. 23, 24.
   Acts xiii. 34, 36).  It is the Kingdom that is referred to in all this,
   not the church.  Hence we read of "the keys of the kingdom," but never
   of   "the keys of the church."  This is left for Romanists to falsely
   claim, and for Protestant interpreters to weakly admit.  Matt. xvi. 19
   is clear as to this.   This key belongs to Christ, as here stated; but
   the opening of the kingdom, in testimony, was committed to Peter, and
   Peter used those keys in his ministry in Acts. i.-xii.  Against that
   kingdom the "gates of the grave" should not prevail."  If "gates"
   denote the entrance to the grave, then it means that death "shall not
   prevail"; and if "gates" (by Metonymy) denote power, then it means that
   the power of the grave will never keep and hold those who enter it.
   Christ holds the key (as stated in i. 18), and therefore He describes
   Himself as

   He that openeth, and no one shall [121] shut; that shutteth and one
   shall [122] open.

   8. I know thy works: (behold I have set before thee an opened door]
   What this means is sufficiently explained by what follows.  It can
   refer only to deliverance, as when the opened door was set before Peter
   (Acts xii. 10;   and compare Isa. xlix. 9, 10).  Their enemies shall
   acknowledge the Lord's protecting power.  What a wrong interpretation
   of these words it is, to take them as referring to an open door for
   service, as is so universally done!  Even as used by Paul in I Cor.
   xvi. 9 it implies deliverance from the "many adversaries"; and in 2
   Cor. ii. 12 the reference is clearly to deliverance from Satan's
   "devices" (v. 11); in Col. iv. 3 the reference is to deliverance from
   his "bonds."

   which no one can shut [123] ):  that thou hast a little strength, and
   didst keep my word]   This, the one important injunction throughout, is
   obeyed by those who are thus addressed.

   and didst not deny my name]   i.e., by receiving another "name"; even
   the name of the Beast.  This, too, refers to another special injunction
   so peculiarly applicable to, and characteristic of, the coming days of
   the great Tribulation.  (See Rev. xiii. 17; xiv. 9, 11, 12).  Here is
   the description of those very days referred to, in this epistle.

   9. Behold, I make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they
   are Jews, and are not, but do lie]   How are these words to be
   explained of the Christian Church, either of these or of any other
   days?  Why should people "say they are Jews" in order to join
   Christians?  Why thus lie?  Do we see any fulfilment of this going on
   around us?  No!  These claim to be Jews and meet in their assemblies
   (or synagogues), but it is "the synagogue of Satan."  They claim to be
   "fellow-servants" (Matt. xxiv. 49).  Those who will be on the earth at
   that time will know what these words mean better than we can know now.
   It is for us to believe them.

   Behold, I will make them to come and bow down before thy feet, and know
   that I have   loved thee.  Is this what is prophesied of the church of
   God?  Is this our  experience?  Has it ever been the experience of the
   Christian Church?  No! trouble and persecution and trial are the lot of
   the church; the portion plainly foretold for it during the time of the
   Lord's rejection until He shall come.  To be hated because He was
   hated; this is our portion now, from which no hope of reprieve is held
   out to us.  But this homage spoken of here belongs to Israel by right
   in a yet future day.  To see this we have to read only such passages as
   Isa. xlv. 14; xlix. 22, 23; lx. 14; lxvi. 1-4, 5, 14.  We can hardly
   conceive it possible that, in the face of such prophecies and promises
   addressed to Israel, anyone could ever interpret their fulfilment in
   these Epistles as belonging to the church of God.   Look at only one
   (Isa. lx. 14):

   "The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto
   thee:
   And all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles
   of they feet."

   The promise made to Christ will be shared in by His people Israel.  See
   Ps. lxxii. 9; cx. 1.   Phil. ii. 10.   Compare Exod. xi. 8.  "That I
   have loved thee"-- both the pronouns here are very emphatic and refer
   to chap. i. 5.

   10. Because thou didst keep the word of my patience]   i.e., the
   patient waiting or endurance which I did command.  See i. 9; ii. 2, 19.
     These commands as to "patience" refer particularly to the waiting
   during and under the tribulation.  If it be asked where this is, the
   answer is clear from chaps. xiii. 10; and xiv. 12 -- "Here is the
   patience of the saints."  It is the patience of those who shall be in
   those scenes of judgment and looking for deliverance out of them.  For
   thus is the promise.

   I also shall keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come
   upon the whole (habitable) world to try them that dwell on the earth]
     These are the scenes foretold in Zeph. i. 14-18, and by our Lord (in
   Luke xxi. 36).  This refers to a brief, definite season (xii.-xix.);
   probably "the three years and a half" closing with the manifestation of
   the Lord Jesus in the clouds.  These earth-dwellers are repeatedly
   mentioned in this book (see vi. 10; xi. 10; xiii. 8, 14).  For the
   "keeping out of the hour," etc. (see Ps. xxxii. 6.   Isa. xxvi. 20,
   21.   John xvii. 15.   Ps. xxvii. 1-5).   This deliverance may the
   "wilderness," as spoken of in chap. xii.

   11. " [124] I come quickly:  Hold fast that which thou hast, that none
   take thy crown]   This can have no reference to the Church of God.  We
   have no crowns to be taken and no one could take them if we had. We are
   in Christ; perfect and secure in Him.

   12. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my
   God]     Here the promise goes on to the days of Solomon, to the
   "temple" and the "city" (as the next Epistle to Laodicea is associated
   with the throne). (See iii. 21 and compare I Kings v. 5; vii. 13-22. 2
   Chron. iii. 15-17.)

   and he shall in no wise go forth any more: and I will write upon him
   the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God]     The promise
   as to both temple and city are fulfilled in chap. xxi. 2, 3. Compare
   Ps. xlviii. 1, 2, 8, 9, and Ezek. xlviii. 35.

   the New Jerusalem (xxi. 2, 10), which descendeth out of heaven from my
   God (xxi. 10) and [I will write upon him] my new name]     Is. lxii. 2;
   lxv. 15. Inscriptions on the person are mentioned in chap. vii. 3. The
   worshippers of the Beast will be marked with his name, chaps. xiii. 16;
   xiv. 11; xix. 20; xx. 4. This promise is specifically fulfilled in
   chaps. xiv. 1, and xxii. 4.

   13. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the
   Assemblies]     See above.


   7. THE SEVENTH EPISTLE.-- LAODICEA.
   (iii. 14-22)

   The Epistle to the Assembly in Laodicea is the last, as it is the most
   solemn, of these Epistles. All the Epistles cover, in a general way,
   the whole period covered by the book; but, they also mark special
   stages of the apostasy and of the tribulation. Laodicea marks the last
   stage. It is the final period immediately before chap. xix., when "the
   Judge standeth before the door" (verse 20. Compare James v. 9). The Old
   Testament illustrations are taken from the Minor Prophets, which cover
   the last period of the nation's history, and form the last testimony
   before the First Advent of Christ; because the same character will mark
   the period immediately preceding the Second Advent or the Day of the
   Lord.

   The Structure is much more simple than any of the other Epistles,
   because the whole position at the period will be reduced to the very
   simple issue of allegiance to Christ or Antichrist.

           a | c | 22.  Christ's command to hear.


   iii. 14. And unto the Angel of the Assembly in Laodicea, [125] write;
   These things saith the Amen]    "Amen" is a Hebrew word (see 2 Cor. i.
   20. Rom. xv. 8), expressing that which is immediately added, "faithful
   and true." Compare Isa. lxv. 16.

   the faithful and true witness]     See on chap. i. 5 above; and compare
   xix. 11 and Ps. lxxxix. 37.

   the beginning of the creation of God]     Reminding of the fact that by
   Him all things were created; and that by Him all things exist and all
   things consist (Col. i. 15-19). Before any created thing was formed,
   Elohim took created form in order to create; so that created beings
   might hold communion with the Creator, which they could not with God,
   who is "Spirit" (John iv. 24). Thus He is referred to in Prov. viii.
   22-31. And thus He appeared to Adam (who was created in His image), and
   to the Patriarchs, and to Joshua as one who could be wrestled with and
   seen and spoken with. All believe that He assumed creature form
   specially for these appearances. It is only one step to further believe
   that this form was more permanent: that He took creature form in order
   to create, as He afterward took human form in order to redeem. (Compare
   the two songs of Rev. iv. 11 and v. 9.) No other view so well enables
   us to understand how He could be called "the Beginning of the creation
   of God," or explain such passages as Prov. viii. 22-31 and Col. i.
   15-17, "the firstborn of every creature" who was "before all things."
   This is all expressed in the words of the ancient Creed. "Begotten of
   His Father before the world; born of the substance of his mother in the
   world." He is therefore the Head of Creation, the great subject of
   which this book treats, thus reminding us here of its beginning, as it
   afterwards tells of its end, and of the New Creation of the New Heaven
   and the New Earth.

   15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would that
   thou wert cold or hot.

   16. Thus, because thou art luke-warm, and neither hot nor cold, [126] I
   am about to spue thee out of my mouth]    These words require no
   exposition. They explain with perfect clearness the condition of things
   among the remnant of the Jews in that day. The same result of
   unfaithfulness is not keeping the word and commandments of God is
   spoken of in Lev. xviii. 25, 28; xx. 22, where the people are told that
   for such disobedience, the very land should spue them out. Compare
   Zech. xi. 1-9, and Hos. iv. 6-7.

   17. Because thou sayest]     See [[4]Laodicea -- The Period of Judah's
   Removal] where these verses are compared with Hosea ii. 5, 8, 9, and
   other passages from the minor prophets, which describe the very
   condition of things here referred to. We enlarged on this point in
   those pages, so as not to over-burden these running comments on the
   text itself.

   I am rich and have become enriched]    Compare Hos. xii. 8.

   And have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched
   one (Hos. ii. 11; v. 15), and the miserable (Hag. i. 6), and poor, and
   blind, and naked (Hos. ii. 3-10).

   18. I counsel thee to buy of me]    When are the members of the Church
   of God, or, indeed, anyone in this dispensation, where all is of grace
   and of gift counselled "to buy" anything of God. We have "nothing to
   pay" and nothing to buy with; and can show no cause nor merit why we
   should have the slightest favour or blessing. Compare for the
   Dispensation of works Is. lv. 1, 2.

   gold refined in the fire (Mal. iii. 3; Hos. ii. 8; Hag. ii. 8), that
   thou mayest be enriched; and white garments, that thou mayest be
   clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made
   manifest]    The reference here is to Jer. xiii. 25, 26, and Hosea ii.
   3.

   and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see]    Compare
   Is. lix. 10.

   19. As many as I love]    See Is. xliii. 4, and compare context. Also
   Deut. vii. 8. Hos. iii. 2; xi. 4.

   I rebuke and chasten]    See Hos. vii. 12; Deut. viii. 5; xxviii. 20;
   and Prov. iii. 12.

   20. Behold, I am standing (lit., "I have taken my station")at the door,
   and am knocking]    The call is to the Wedding Feast of chap. xix. 9,
   to which the parables pointed, especially Luke xii. 35-38. The servants
   are exhorted to be "like unto men that wait for their Lord when he
   shall return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh they
   may open to him immediately. Blessed are those servants whom the Lord
   when he cometh shall find watching. The coming is no longer spoken of
   as "near" -- he is already at the door.

   To the twelve Tribes scattered abroad it is written in view of his
   coming -- "The judge standeth before the door" (Jas. v. 7, 8, 9). The
   nearness of the Lord as the "judge" is the warning conveyed by these
   words in the Epistle to the Assembly in Laodicea, and not the nearness
   of the Saviour in grace, or an invitation to sinners in this day of
   grace. Can anything be clearer than this? and can language be more
   incongruous as applied to any in this present dispensation.

   if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and
   will sup with him, and he with me]     It is in connection with the
   knocking just referred to in Luke xii. 37 that the promise is given to
   the "servants" spoken of (not to the church). "Verily I say unto you
   that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat, and he
   will come forth and serve them." Compare Matt. xxii. 2, 3. Luke xiv.
   15; xxii. 16-18. Mark xiv. 25, and Rev. xix. 9. This is the same
   watching which is spoken of in verse 39 as the watching for the coming
   as a thief.

   21. To him that overcometh will I give to take his seat with me on my
   throne, even as I also overcame and took my seat with my Father on His
   throne]    This promise is seen fulfilled in xx. 4. The session of the
   Lord Jesus is spoken of here as past. He is now from His seat and is
   about to come down in judgment to avenge the blood of His martyred
   saints. Hence Stephen sees the same "Son of Man, standing," Acts vii.
   56. Nothing proves more clearly the two thrones of which Scripture
   speaks. His Father's throne, on which He is now seated, and "the throne
   of His father David," to which Christ is the heir as David's Son and
   David's Lord (Luke xx. 42). Compare Ezek. xliii. 7. Ps. cxxii. 5. It is
   this throne which He will occupy when He comes in His glory. Luke i.
   32. Acts. ii. 30 Heb. ii. 5. Matt. xxv. 31. Ps. viii. Dan. vii. and
   Rev. xx. 4. There is a third throne spoken of in chap. xxii. 1, 3; but
   that is "the throne of God and of the Lamb," and is after the
   Millennium. The promise in iii. 21 refers to the throne of Solomon.
   [[5]See the Seventh (Laodicea)].

   22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying unto
   the Assemblies]    Here end these seven epistles. And we feel that no
   one can thus read and study them without becoming convinced that they
   belong to another dispensation altogether; when "works" and not grace
   form the standing; and Israel and not the Church is the subject.

                   The First Vision "in Heaven": Chapters 4-5

   The Throne and its surroundings


   We now come to the matter of the Book, which we have indicated by the
   letter X [in the section [6]The Scope of the Apocalypse Shewn by its
   Structure]. It consists, as we have seen, of seven pairs of visions.

   The first of each pair is a Vision "in heaven"; and the second of each
   pair is a Vision "on earth."

   Each Vision "in heaven" is preparatory to the Vision afterwards seen
   "on earth": and what is seen "on earth" is the carrying out of the
   Vision previously seen "in heaven." The one is mutually explanatory of
   the other. The heavenly Vision explains what is going to take place
   upon the earth; and the utterances in each heavenly Vision set forth
   the special object of the earthly events which are to follow. The
   former Vision of each pair is, therefore, the key to the latter.

   These divisions are made by the Holy Spirit Himself; and the divisions
   , made by man into chapters, where they do not agree with the Divine
   divisions, are only misleading.

   We shall have, therefore, wholly to ignore them, except for purposes of
   reference.

   These heavenly and earthly Visions will form the great chapters or
   divisions of this part of our work. We shall take each of these
   fourteen Visions in order: first giving the structure, with any
   necessary expansions; following each with our own translation, based on
   a revised Greek Text, according to the authorities quoted in the notes;
   interspersed with such running expository remarks as may be necessary.

   The structures themselves will be found full of teaching, and will give
   the scope of each section; showing, at a glance, what are the subjects
   of which our attention is to be fixed.

   The following is the structure (in brief) of H^1, the first Vision "in
   heaven," consisting of chapters iv. and v.


   H^1.^   THE FIRST VISION "IN HEAVEN"
   (chap. iv., v)

   The Throne and its surroundings

   H^1 | A | iv. 1-8-.  The Throne, the Elders and the Zoa
               B | -8-11.  The utterances of the Zoa and the Elders.
   Theme: Creation.
           A | v. 1-7.  The Throne and the Book:  the Lion and the Lamb.
               B | 8-14.  The New Song of the Zoa and the Elders.  Other
   heavenly utterances.  Theme:  Redemption.


   From this it will be seen that the great subjects of this Vision "in
   heaven" are:--

   THE THRONE, THE BOOK, AND THE LAMB.

   That which comes first in the Book gives its importance and
   significance to the whole Book. It is the key to all that follows, and
   carries us forward by the Spirit to the future age, the coming "Day of
   the Lord." The first thing seen and the first mentioned (in verse 2) is


   THE THRONE.

   "Immediately, I became in Spirit; and behold! a throne was set in
   heaven."

   No words could be more important as fixing our minds on the great
   central and all-governing fact which pervades the Book of this
   prophecy.

   It is the day spoken of in Ps. ciii. 19.

   "The Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens;
   And His kingdom ruleth over all."

   And in Pss. ix. and x., which treat of the coming great Tribulation as
   the "times of trouble" (ix. 9, and x. 1), it is declared: The Lord
   "hath prepared His throne for judgment." And in Ps. xi. 4-6 we read:

   "The Lord is in his holy temple,
   The Lord's throne is in heaven:
   His eyes behold,
   His eyelids try the children of men.
   The Lord trieth the righteous:
   But the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth.
   Upon the wicked he shall rain snares,
   Fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest:
   This shall be the portion of their cup."

   These three Psalms foretell and refer to the scenes described more
   fully in the Apocalypse.

   Daniel (vii. 9, 10) also speaks of this very moment when he says "I
   behold till the thrones were set" (not "cast down" as in AV. but
   "placed" as in RV. [127] ) "and the ancient of days did sit... His
   throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery
   stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands
   ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
   him: THE JUDGMENT WAS SET, and the books were opened."

   This throne speaks of judgment; "the throne of grace" is no longer
   seen. Grace is the character of this present dispensation; while
   judgment, righteousness, and justice will characterise that which is
   coming. The heavenly voice announces it. "Just and true are thy ways,
   thou king of nations" (xv. 3 q.v.). "Thy judgments are made manifest"
   (verse 4). "Thou art just, who art and who wast the holy One, because
   thou judgedst thus" (xvi. 5; see also verse 7, and xix. 2, 11). The
   martyred ones are represented as crying "How long, O Sovereign Lord,
   [128] the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
   the dwellers on the earth" (vi. 10). The reply is, not that this cry is
   out of place, but that it is only premature: they are to wait a little
   longer. Heaven itself bids all to rejoice at the execution of judgment
   (xviii. 20; xix. 2). "Fear God and give glory to him" (is the cry that
   will then go forth), "for the hour of his judgment is come" (xiv. 7).
   Judgment is also the final Vision (xx. 4); and it is given to the
   saints who have overcome. Psalm cxlix. 5-9 also tells of that final
   scene.

   "Let the saints be joyful in glory:
   Let them sing aloud upon their beds.
   Let the high praises of God (El) be in their mouth,
   And a two-edged sword in their hand;
   To execute vengeance upon the heathen,
   And punishments upon the people;
   To bind their kings with chains,
   And their nobles with fetters of iron;
   To execute upon them the judgment written:
   This honour have all His saints. Hallelujah."

   The Throne, therefore, with which this first Vision "in heaven"
   commences, is the great central object. The structure shows this; and
   it shows also other prominent objects, viz. the Book and the Lamb, and
   their relation to two great subjects, Creation (chap. iv.) and
   Redemption (chap. v).

   Before we proceed to the translation we must give the expansion of A.
   iv. 1-8-. Its importance is seen from the minuteness with which the
   Throne is described.

   A. iv. 1-8-.  The Throne.

   A | a | 1-3-.  On it:  the Enthroned One.
           b | d | -3.  Round it:  a Rainbow.
                   e | 4.  Round it:  24 Thrones.
                       c | 5-.  Out of it:  Lightnings.
           b | d | -5.  Before it:  Seven Lamps.
                   e | 6-.  Before it:  a Crystal Sea.
        a | -6-8-.  In the midst and round about it:  the four Zoa.


   We now proceed to give the translation of each separate member, marking
   each with the corresponding letters, so that its place in the general
   structure and plan can be easily referred to, found and followed.

   A. iv. 1-8-. THE THRONE.

   a. 1-3-. On it: the Enthroned One.

   iv. 1. After these things]     Seven times in this book we have this or
   a similar expression (iv. 1; vii. 1, 9; xv. 5; xviii. 1; xix. 1; xx.
   3). As in the last case a thousand years intervene, it is clear that
   what is seen does not necessarily follow immediately. (It is a Hebrew
   idiom. Compare Gen. xxii. 1).

   I looked, and, behold a door set open IN HEAVEN]    There are five
   openings mentioned in this Book; and, while they do not mark special
   literary divisions, yet they are all of the deepest importance and
   significance. See xi. 19; xv. 5; xix. 11; and xxi. 1. This first is a
   "door" opened to admit John. But when the Armies of Heaven come forth,
   then John says: "And I saw Heaven opened" (xix. 11), and not merely a
   door. The same happened to Ezekiel when he saw "visions of (or from)
   God."

   And the former voice which I heard (at the beginning, i. 10) was as it
   were of a trumpet speaking with me (i. 10), saying, "Come up hither,
   and I will show thee what things must come to pass hereafter"]
   There is no necessity for taking these words (...) (die genesthai)
   differently from i. 1, 19; xxii. 6. Matt. xxiv. 6; xxvi. 64. Dan. ii.
   28, 29. (...) (meta tauta) means (literally) after these things, when
   used in historic narrative; but when used in promise or prophecy the
   expression means hereafter. See i. 19 and ix. 12.

   2. [129] Immediately I came to be in Spirit]     See chap. i. 10; xvii.
   3; and xxi. 10. And for the further uses of (...) (en pneumati) in
   spirit, see Rom. ix. 1; xiv. 17; xv. 16. I Cor. xii. 3, 9. 2 Cor. vi.
   6. I Thess. i. 5. Jude 20 and Micah iii. 8.

   and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and upon the throne was One
   sitting]    This is evidently the Father; who henceforth, throughout
   the book, is spoken of as "He that sitteth upon the throne." He is
   distinguished from the Son in vi. 16; vii. 10.

   3. And He that sat was, in appearance like to a jasper stone and a
   sardius; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, -- like, in
   appearance, to an emerald]     It cannot be known precisely what is
   meant by the appearance of these stones, nor can we identify them
   satisfactorily. But there is no doubt as to the "rainbow." It speaks of
   a scene of judgment -- not of water, but of fire; and it tells also of
   hope and deliverance for those concerned in the covenant of which it is
   the "sign." The form tells us of the covenant of Gen. ix. 8-17; and the
   colour, being the opposite of that of fire, tells of mercy in the midst
   of judgment (Hab. iii. 3. Ps. ci. 1).

   4. And round about the throne (behold) four and twenty thrones; and
   upon the four and twenty thrones [130] elders sitting, arrayed in white
   garments]    The word for the Elders' thrones is the same as that for
   "the throne" of verse 2. Probably they were both smaller and lower; as
   they were also evidently subordinate.

   and on their heads [131] crowns of gold]     The common interpretation
   is that the Elders are symbolical of the Church of God. But why not
   leave them alone? Why must they be something different from what they
   are? David arranged his twenty-four courses of the Priesthood (I Chron.
   xxiv. 3-5) after the heavenly order. And he had it all "by the Spirit."
   "All this," said David, "the Lord made me understand in writing by His
   hand upon me" [132] (I Chron. xxviii. 11-13, 19). It was the same in
   the case of the Tabernacle which served "unto the example and shadow of
   heavenly things, as when Moses was admonished of God when he was about
   to make the Tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things
   according to the pattern showed thee in the mount" (Heb. viii. 5 and
   refs.). Hence, they are called "patterns of things in the heavens"
   (Heb. ix. 23). It was the same with David and the Temple, so that when
   David copied on earth was a pattern of real things "in the Heavens."
   The Temple worship on earth was therefore modelled on that worship
   which is carried on in heaven: and which , if we were caught up now, we
   should see being carried on there by these heavenly leaders of heaven's
   worship.

   These elders are the heads of the heavenly priesthood; the
   chief-priests or elders of Heavenly worship and rule. The comparative
   (...) (presbuteros) elder) has been distinguished from (...)
   (presbutes) old man), from the most ancient times, as marking and
   denoting official position. It is preserved in our Eng. Alderman or
   elder man. In the papyri is it constantly used of both civil and
   religious rulers. The affairs of the whole priesthood of the Egyptian
   mysteries were conducted by an annual council of 25 presbuteroi. The
   word does not mean "priest" in any sense, for we often find the
   expression "presbyter-priest" "used of a ruler among priest," so that
   there were priestly-governors as well as civil-governors. [133] The
   word is used in this sense in the Old Testament of "elders of the
   priests." (See Isa. xxxvii. 1. Jer. xix. 1; and passages given below).
   This is the meaning of the word here also.

   David distributed his twenty-four courses, sixteen from the sons of
   Eleazar; and eight from the sons of Ithamar. These were "governors of
   the sanctuary and governors of the house of God." (I Chron. xxiv. 5).
   If we ask, Why twenty-four? the answer is because twelve is the number
   of governmental perfection; and wherever we find it, or any multiple of
   it, it is always associated with government and rule.

   It was the number (24,000) of the Levites who were to serve in the
   house of the Lord (I Chron. xxiii. 3, 4).

   It was the number of the prophets who were to lead the praises of God
   with instruments of song (I Chron. xxv. 31).

   The porters of the sons of Levi were twenty-four (I Chron. xxvi.
   17-19).

   The same number obtained in the Palace as in the Temple.

   Twelve captains presided over 24,000 (I Chron. xxvii. 1-15).

   Twelve officers were set over the Treasuries (verses 25-31).

   So these four-and-twenty elders are the princely leaders, rulers, and
   governors of Heaven's worship. They are kings and priests. They were
   not, and cannot be, the Church of God. They are seen already crowned
   when the throne is first set up. They are crowned now. They were not,
   and are not redeemed, for they distinguish between themselves and those
   who are redeemed. See their song below (chap. v. 9, 10 and RV.). They
   speak of the time of "giving the reward to thy servants" (xi. 18), not
   to us thy servants. They are heavenly unfallen beings, and therefore
   they are "arrayed in white robes." They speak of Creation (iv. 8-11).
   And when they sing of Redemption (v. 8-14) it is called "a new song."
   Redemption would be no new song to the Church of God, for it would be
   the old song which they had so often sung upon earth as "the old, old
   story." One of them speaks to John (vii. 13-17) as though separate and
   different from both the great multitude and from John himself. They
   offer "golden bowls full of odours, which are the prayers of the saints
   (v. 8). They are priests ministering for others. Is this the work of
   the Church? Their functions are altogether priestly. See 2 Chron. v.
   11-14. And, as "elders," they were also rulers; and hence are seen
   seated on thrones (see Gen. xxiv. 2. Ex. iii. 16. In 1 Sam. xxx. 26,
   and 2 Sam. iii. 17; v. 3). They are next to the King, his councillors.
   (Compare 2 Sam. xvii. 4 and 1 Kings viii. 1-3). From all this we may
   gather the position of these four-and-twenty elders; and see that, to
   interpret them of the Church is to force many passages of Scripture
   into a meaning which they cannot have.

   5. and out of the throne go forth lightnings and voices and thunders
   [134] ; and seven torches of fire are burning before the throne, which
   are the seven spirits of God]     See above on i. 4; iii. 1; and
   compare v. 6. These seven spirits are "before the throne" ready to obey
   the commands of Him who sits thereon. The throne itself has all the
   accessories of judgment which inspire awe and speak of coming wrath.

   6. and (behold) before the throne, like [135] a glassy sea, like
   crystal]     It does not say what it was, but only what it was "like."
   Having been told what it was "like," it is not for us to seek for any
   further symbolism. Heaven, we believe, is a place of glorious
   realities, and not a place of unsubstantial shadows. We shall one day
   see what John saw, and then we shall know. Now, we have to believe what
   is written until faith shall be exchanged for sight.

   And in the midst of the throne and around the throne, four Zoa, full of
   eyes before and behind. 7. and the first Zoon was like a lion, and the
   second Zoon like an ox, and the third Zoon having the face as a man,
   and the fourth Zoon like a flying eagle. 8. and the four Zoa had each
   of them respectively, six wings; around and within they are full of
   eyes]     The word "beasts" is not the same as in chaps. xii. and xvii.
   Here it is (...) (zoon), and means any living creature; but in chap.
   xiii. and xvii. it is (...) (therion), a wild, untamed beast. It is
   difficult to find a term which shall exactly represent the original.
   "Living creature" is both vague and cumbrous; "living beings" implies
   too much of humanity; "living ones" would be better, but as the word is
   sometimes used in the singular number it would cause confusion to say
   "living one," inasmuch as "the Living One" is used in this book as one
   of the Divine titles of the Lord Jesus. We have judged it better
   therefore to leave the word untranslated, and use Zoon in the singular,
   and Zoa in the plural. No difficulty will be experienced, as the word
   is already partly Anglicised and understood in our words, Zoology,
   Zoological, Zoophyte, Zootomy, Zoonymy, &c., which all have to do with
   living things; animate as opposed to inanimate.

   The first time the Zoa are mentioned in the Bible they are named,
   though they are not described. In Gen. iii. 24 they are called "the
   Cherubim," and this word has never been translated in any Version. We
   have, therefore, a good precedent for leaving their other names, Zoon
   and Zoa, also untranslated.

   The Zoa are described in Ezekiel (chap. i. 5-14), and they are
   identified in Ezek. x. 20 with the cherubim. "This is the living
   creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and
   I knew that they were the cherubims." The two terms are used
   interchangeably in Ezekiel. Compare i. 22 and x. 1, 15. No one can tell
   us anything about them beyond what God has Himself told us. Man's
   opinions as to what they "represent" are hardly worth controverting.
   Our own opinions are equally worthless; we can only point our readers
   to what God has revealed about them.

   Some would have it that they represent the Godhead; but it is hardly
   likely that God, who commanded that no emblem of Deity should be made,
   should make one Himself; especially one like unto "an ox that eateth
   grass." (See Deut. iv. 15, 16. Rom. i. 22, 23. Ps. cvi. 19, 20).
   Moreover, they offer worship, but are never worshipped themselves (Isa.
   vi. Rev. iv., v.).

   Some think they represent the four Gospels; but animals can hardly
   represent books. Moreover, it is difficult to see the point of the four
   Gospels guarding the Tree of Life, or occupying such a prominent place
   in the Tabernacle and in the Temple.

   That they cannot be the Church is clear from the following facts:

   1. Three out of the four are animals, and there must be some sort of
   congruity between even a symbol and the thing signified.

   2. They call for judgment (chap. vi.), and give the bowls "full of
   wrath of God" to the Seven Vial Angels (chap. xv.). This is surely not
   the work of the Church, either now or in the future.

   3. Rev. v. 9, 10, according to the correct text and translation, shows
   that these Zoa do not speak of themselves as redeemed, but distinguish
   themselves from such. See below, our exposition of those verses.

   4. They cannot be any ordinary angelic beings, inasmuch, as they are
   distinguished from the angels in chap. v. 8, 11. Neither do they ever
   receive any commission, as angels always do. On the contrary, they give
   orders, as angels do not.

   5. They are attached to the Throne of God, and are never seen apart
   from it.

   6. They are first mentioned, as we have said, in Gen. iii. 24: "So He
   drove out the man; and He placed (in a Tabernacle), at the east of the
   garden of Eden, Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way,
   to keep the way of the tree of life." The verb "keep," here, means to
   preserve and care for, and guard, as in Gen. ii. 15 and xviii. 19, etc.
   We first see them in connection with the Fall; and we note the fact
   that they are representative of animate creation, hence their name Zoa.
   Their number, four, connects them also with the earth [136] ; and Rom.
   viii. 19-21 makes the whole creation to partake of the effects of the
   Fall "For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the
   revelation of the sons of God. For to vanity was the creation
   subjected, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected the same:
   and this was in hope, because the creation itself also shall be freed
   from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the
   children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth together
   and travaileth together until now" (Rom. viii. 19-21).

   These words receive a new significance if we regard the Cherubim, or
   Zoa, as being the concrete representation of this groaning creation;
   and as being the pledge that its groaning shall one day cease, and its
   hope be fulfilled. That hope was given when they were first placed, as
   in an Tabernacle, (as the word means), at the gate of Eden. There, at
   that time, was the Lord's presence manifested. Hither Cain and Abel
   brought their offerings; and from this "presence of the Lord" Cain went
   out (Gen. iv. 14-16).

   It may be that the Tabernacle of God continued up to the time of the
   Flood. For Shem is spoken of as the custodian of this "dwelling place."
   The word "placed" in Gen. iii. 24 is (...) (shaken), and it means to
   station or dwell in a tabernacle, and is commonly spoken of as God's
   dwelling among men and of His dwelling place. [137] In Gen. ix. 26, 27,
   we read:

   "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem;
           And Canaan shall be his servant.
           God shall enlarge Japhet:
   And He (i.e., God) shall dwell (or place His tabernacle) in the tents
   of Shem."

   Here the three patriarchs are mentioned. Canaan (i.e., Ham) and Japhet
   occupy the two central lines; while Shem and the Lord His God occupy
   the two outer lines. If this be so, then, this Tabernacle of the Divine
   presence continued among men down to the Flood and contained the
   Cherubim.

   After the Flood, the Teraphim (probably a corruption of Cherubim) were
   made in imitation of them, and became objects of worship. The
   remembrance of them was carried away by the scattered nations (Gen.
   xi.), and probably the Assyrian sculptures are traditional corruptions
   of the Cherubim, for they consisted of a man with an eagle's head; a
   lion or a winged bull with a human head.

   When God set up the Tabernacle in Israel it was that He might "dwell
   among them" (Exod. xxv. 8; where we have the same word as that used in
   Gen. iii. 24: "placed in a tabernacle"). The first thing made was not
   the Tabernacle itself, but the Ark of the Covenant with its mercy-seat
   and the Cherubim (Exod. xxv. 10-12). These were not the real cherubim,
   of course; they were only copies of them on the mercy-seat.
   Representations of them were woven into the Vail (Exod. xxvi. 31;
   xxxvi. 35). This could only have been to show that, henceforth, the
   hope of creation was bound up with "the hope of Israel"; and, that both
   were bound up in, and based on, the merits of atoning blood. From
   "between the Cherubim" God spoke; and there His glory dwelt. (I Sam.
   iv. 4. 2 Sam. vi. 2. Ps. lxxx. 1, 3, 7, 14, 19. Isa. xxxvii. 16). The
   original Covenant with Adam, and with the Son of Man Himself, takes in
   the whole animate creation, and tells of the hope of its deliverance
   (Ps. viii. 6-8; cxlviii. 7-11). And millennial glory will not be
   complete without that hope being fulfilled (Isa. xi. 6-9).

   In Rev. iv. and v. the Son of Man is about to realise this hope of
   creation; and, therefore, creation rejoices in the blessed prospect.
   The Zoa are seen attached to the throne, and they speak of creation.
   The earth is about to be judged; and their deliverance is at hand.
   Hence they say, "Thou art worthy, O Lord and our God, to receive glory
   and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy
   pleasure they were, and were created" (iv. 11). They speak, too, of the
   redemption on which the coming deliverance is based (chap. v. 9, 10;
   see below); and thus explain the object with which they had been
   associated with the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat.

   In all this we are on Old Testament ground; for when allusion is made
   to these momentous truths in Rom. viii., creation's hope is spoken of
   as being distinct from that of the Church, though bound up with it, and
   depending upon its manifestation in glory. In brief, then, we may say,
   that the cherubim are heavenly realities; living ones of whom we know
   nothing by experience. But, the references made to them in Scripture
   teach us that in some way they tell us of Creation's association with
   the effects of the Fall, and of the future hope of deliverance from
   those effects. Hence, their introduction here, now that that
   deliverance is at hand; and hence their words also, which tell that it
   is near.

   This brings us to the utterances of the Zoa and of the twenty-four
   Elders in B, iv. -8-11.


   B, chap. iv. -8-11.
   THE UTTERANCES OF THE ZOA AND ELDERS.

   The Theme -- Creation.

   We now come to B, iv. -8-11, the subject of which is the worship and
   utterances of the Zoa and the Elders. This is part of the larger
   structure of H^1, and still part of the first vision seen "in Heaven."

   The following is the structure:

   B | f | -8-.  Worship of the Zoa. "And they rest not
               g | -8.  Their utterance (creation). "Holy, holy, holy...
        f | 9, 10.  Worship of the Elders. "And when...
               g | 11.  Their new song (creation).  "Thou art worthy...


   iv. -8. And they have no cessation day and night, saying
   "Holy, Holy, Holy
   Lord God Almighty
   Who was, and who is, and who is coming."

   This is the first of all the seventeen Heavenly utterances. They begin
   with God Himself, and relate to what He is in Himself; and not to what
   He has, or has done, or is going to do. The emphasis is on "who was,"
   because it is put first. [138] The object of the whole Book, and of all
   that it records, is to establish the Holiness of God, which is here, at
   the very outset, the first thing that is proclaimed. The reign of
   Heaven is about to be established in the Earth, when all shall be holy,
   where now all is unholy. Hence we have the same thought in the great
   Kingdom-prayer:

   "Our Father which art in heaven,
   Hallowed (or Holy) be Thy Name,
   Thy Kingdom come,
   Thy will be done on earth as it is heaven."

   Then, and not till then, we have "us." "Give us," etc. It is remarkable
   also that there are three Psalms which proleptically speak of this
   coming reign. Psalms xciii., xcvii., and xcix. The three Psalms which
   precede these commence with the command to sing, and then these Psalms
   which follow each begin "the Lord reigneth." Not yet can they be sung
   of accomplished facts, but the day is coming when they can, and will
   be, sung of then present glorious realities. The point, however, we
   wish to notice is that, each of these three Psalms ends with a
   reference to God's holiness, because it will then be said "the Lord
   reigneth." But the heavenly utterances in Revelation begin with the
   proclamation of this holiness, because those who say "Holy, Holy,
   Holy," are about to call for the judgments which are to bring in that
   coming Holy Reign. (See Isa. xxiii. 18. Zech. xiv. 20, 21). Those three
   Psalms must be carefully read in the light of the Apocalypse.

   The first (xciii.) is called for by the song for the Sabbath (xcii.),
   which speaks of the millennial Sabbath-keeping which is to come, and
   tells of the destruction of the wicked, the perishing of the enemies
   and the scattering of the workers of iniquity, before the Lord is
   exalted as most High for evermore. (verses 7-9). Then comes the answer
   in Psalm xciii., which begins "THE LORD REIGNETH," and tells of the
   Throne being established, and ends with the declaration, "holiness
   becometh thine house, O Lord, for ever."

   The second (xcvii.) is called for in the Psalm xcvi. 1. "O sing unto
   the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth"; and speaks of
   the millennial glory, which is summed up in verse 11:
       "Let the heavens rejoice,
       And let the earth be glad." [139]

   This, too, is the burden of the final heavenly utterances in Rev. xix.
   5, 7. Then comes the answer in Psalm xcvii., which begins "THE LORD
   REIGNETH," and tells how "righteousness and judgment are the habitation
   of this throne" (verse 2; and compare Rev. xv. 3; xvi. 7; xix. 2); and
   goes on to speak of the very judgments which are described in the
   Apocalypse, and also of the same exaltation of Jehovah high above all
   the earth (verse 9; compare xcii. 8). It ends by calling on the
   righteous to "rejoice in the Lord... and give thanks at the remembrance
   of His holiness."

   The third (xcix.) is called for in Psalm xcviii. 1-3: "O sing unto the
   Lord a new song: for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand and
   his holy arm hath gotten him the victory... He hath remembered his
   mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel." Then comes the answer
   in Psalm xcix., which begins "THE LORD REIGNETH; let the people
   tremble: he sitteth between the cherubim, let the earth be moved"
   (marg., stagger). Three times in this Psalm we have the three-fold
   "Holy" of the Zoa in Rev. iv. 8 giving us its interpretation and
   significance:

   Verse 3. "Let them praise thy great and terrible name: for it is holy."

   Verse 5. "Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool, for
   he is holy." And

   Verse 9. "Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill; for he
   is holy."

   All this truth and teaching is embraced in this first heavenly
   utterance, spoken by the four Zoa.

   We have called attention to the fact that each Vision seen "IN HEAVEN"
   is marked by heavenly voices; and we have stated that it is in these we
   must look for the key to the judgment scenes which follow on earth. We
   shall have, therefore, to give more attention than is usually done to
   the significance of these utterances; weigh their words, learn their
   lessons, and note their bearing on what follows "on earth."

   9. And when the Zoa shall give glory, honour, and thanksgiving to Him
   who sitteth upon the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

   10. The four and twenty elders shall fall down before Him who sitteth
   upon the throne, and they shall [140] worship Him who liveth for ever
   and ever, and shall [141] cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
           "Worthy art thou, O Lord and our God, [142]
           To receive glory, and honour, and power;
           Because Thou didst create all things,
           And for thy pleasure they were, [143] and are created"]
   Thus, creation is the subject of the first great utterance of the Zoa
   and the Elders. Their words announce the blessed fact that the
   judgments which are about to take place, have for their great object
   the removal of the curse, and of all unholiness from the earth; and the
   ending of creation's groaning and travail. These heavenly elders take
   part in this heavenly utterance, and they acknowledge its truth by
   bowing their heads in worship and homage.


   A, chap. v. 1-7.
   THE THRONE AND THE BOOK: THE LION AND THE LAMB.

   Having considered the member B, iv. -8-11, we now come to the member A,
   v. 1-7, the subject of which is The Throne, and the Book: The Lion and
   the Lamb.

   Here, as in A. iv. 1-8-, we have the Throne. But, here it is rather Him
   that sitteth upon the throne, than the Throne itself.

   A | h | 1-.  Right hand.  "And I saw...
               i | -1.  A Book.
                   k | 2-5.  The Lion.  "And I saw...
                   k | 6.  The Lamb.  "And I saw...
               i | 7-.  The Book.  "And he came...
         h | -7.  Right hand.  "Out of the right hand.


   v. 1. And I saw on the right hand of Him that sitteth upon the throne,
   a Book (or Roll), written within and on the back, having been sealed
   with seven seals]     Much ingenuity has been spent in the
   interpretation of this "Book," and what it represents. Some have
   suggested that it is the history of the Christian Church, but we trust
   our readers are fairly convinced by this time that the Church is not
   the subject of the Apocalypse.

   Neither can it be "the book of the Covenant" yet to be made with
   Israel, because that New Covenant is in mercy (Heb. x. 16, 17), while
   this book has to do with judgment. Why should we go out of our way to
   seek for a far-fetched meaning when we have such plain indications in
   the Word itself of what a sealed book denotes. In Is. xxix. 11 we read:
   "And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that
   is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this,
   I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed." In Dan. xii.
   1-3, we read of the Great Tribulation, which is the central subject of
   the Apocalypse. But Daniel is not permitted to do much more than make
   known the fact of the great Tribulation out of which Daniel's people,
   the Jews, were to be delivered. The particulars, and the circumstances
   of that day, were not to be made known at that time by Daniel. Hence,
   it is said to him (Dan. xii. 4): "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the
   words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end." And when Daniel
   enquired (verse 8) as to "what should be the end of these things?" The
   answer is (verse 9), "Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up
   and sealed till the time of the end." The details of a former vision
   Daniel was told also to seal up. "Wherefore shut thou up the vision:
   for it shall be for many days" (viii. 26).

   What ought we to look for as the first thing, in the Apocalypse, which,
   as we have seen, has the end of the "many days" and "the time of the
   end" for its great subject, but the unsealing of this book, the sealing
   of which is so prominently spoken of in the book of Daniel? When the
   time comes for the fulfilment of all that is written in this book, then
   the seals are opened. Even then, though these seven seals be opened,
   there are still certain things which even John himself has to "seal
   up," viz., "the things which the seven thunders uttered" (x. 4). We
   take it therefore that the opening of the seals of this book is the
   enlargement, development and continuation of the Book of Daniel,
   describing, from God's side, the judgments necessary to secure the
   fulfilment of all that He has foretold. The opening of each seal has a
   special judgment as its immediate result. The roll given to Ezekiel was
   of similar import. "He spread it before me, and it was written within
   and without; and there were written therein, lamentations and mourning
   and woe" (Ezek. ii. 10). In like manner, the opening of the seals of
   this book disclose tribulation and mourning and woe. But there is more
   in the "Book" than this. There is also the object of all this judgment.
   That object is the redemption of the forfeited inheritance. (See the
   notes on verse 2, below). The special importance of this "Book" (and
   all that is involved in it) is set forth by its structure, which is as
   follows:--

   The Translation of k, v. 2-5.

   v. 2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice -- "Who is
   worthy to open the Book, and to loose the seals thereof?"]     It looks
   as though there is something more in this 7-Sealed Book than what we
   have said on verse 1. There is evidently more in this book than the
   mere continuation of Daniel's prophecies. This is there, without doubt,
   but there must be that which calls for all these judgments and requires
   the putting forth of all this power. If the Book has to do with the
   whole subject of prophecy, with its causes, and not merely with its
   consequences and its end, then it may well take us back to the
   beginning, to which the cherubim already point us, when man was driven
   out from Paradise, when he forfeited his inheritance; and the promise
   of a coming Deliverer and Redeemer was given.

   This First Vision "in Heaven" (iv. v.) takes up the history of man in
   relation to the Throne, at the point where it was left in Gen. iii. 24.
   The Throne is here set up; but man is outside and unable still to gain
   access to "The Tree of Life." Hence this proclamation "Who is worthy?"
   Who has the right to redeem the forfeited inheritance, the lost
   Paradise? Satan is in possession of this world now. He is its "God" and
   "prince" (John xii. 31; xiv. 30; xvi. 11. Eph. ii. 2), and as such he
   was able in a peculiar way to tempt Him who had come to redeem it in
   the only lawful way in which it could be redeemed. (See Lev. xxv. 25;
   Deut xxv. 5; and Ruth iv. 1-6). If this be so, then we understand this
   proclamation, which has so important a place in this heavenly vision.
   And the enquiry will be like that of Boaz, Who will act the Goel's (or
   Redeemer's) part for man and for Israel, and recover his lost estate.
   Jer. xxxii. shows that a sealed book was given in connection with such
   a transaction (read verses 6-16); and if so, then it serves as an
   illustration for a much weightier redemption, even that of the new song
   which immediately follows in this Heavenly Vision; the song whose theme
   is nothing less than the Redemption of Creation, accomplished by One
   who was altogether worthy, both by unanswerable right and unequalled
   might. For the Goel was an avenger as well as a Redeemer.

   3. and no one was able, in the heaven nor upon the earth, neither under
   the earth, to open the Book, or to look at it]    The worthiness
   required is so great that no created being is able even to contemplate
   it. There was not one that could make reply to the herald's challenge.

   4. and I was weeping much because no one worthy was found to open [144]
   the Book or to look at it]     The scene must have been very vivid and
   real to John to produce this sadness. These tears were not caused by
   disappointed inquisitiveness! Surely, he must have realised, somewhat,
   the serious nature of the consequences involved if one worthy could not
   have been found. There must have been something, and enough in the
   character or appearance of the Book, to tell him this: for no voice had
   yet said anything as to its nature or contents. One of the Elders
   breaks the silence.

   5. And one of the elders saith to me "Weep not! Behold the Lion which
   is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, prevailed [145] so as to
   open the Book, and shall loose the seven seals of it]     Not one of
   the Elders, or the Cherubim, or Angel, or Spirit, could accomplish the
   work of the Goel (or Redeemer). None of these could be "next of kin,"
   none but the Son of Man, who was David's Son and David's Lord. None but
   He who was at once the "Root" from whence David sprang, and the
   "offspring" which sprang from David, could be next-of-kin, and
   therefore entitled to redeem the forfeited Inheritance of the Throne,
   the Land, and the People. He was "the Lion of the Tribe of Judah" (Gen.
   xlix. 8-10. Num. xxiv. 7-9 Isa. ix. 6, 7; xi. 1. Ps. lxxxix. 20-29).

   The Lord Jesus will prevail as the Lion; and it is of this the Book
   treats; but, He first prevailed as the Lamb slain. Hence, when John
   turned, he saw, not a Lion, according to the Elder's announcement, but
   a Lamb, according to the prior historical fact.

   He first takes the place of man as outside the garden and the tree of
   life (Gen. iii. 24). His Redemption work commenced on earth by His
   coming, not into a garden, but into a wilderness (Matt. iv. 1). He
   approaches that flaming sword and hears the words of Him who said
   "Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and against the MAN that is My
   fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts" (Zech. xiii. 7). This sword was
   sheathed in Him, and thus He becomes entitled to enter and worthy to
   take the Book.

   When John first looks (verse 1), he sees only "the Throne and the
   Book," which are separated from the second by the structure. For when
   he looks the second time (verse 6), he sees "the Lamb." The Lamb is now
   seen in the midst of the Throne. He occupies no longer the outside
   place. He is entitled to enter and approach the throne, for He alone is
   "worthy."

   6. And I saw [146] in the midst of the throne and of the four Zoa, and
   in the midst of the Elders -- a Lamb, standing as having been slain,
   having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God,
   having been sent [147] into the whole earth]      The Elder spoke of a
   Lion: but John turns and see a Lamb. The Elder spoke of the
   consequence: John sees the cause. The Lion is about to put forth His
   power and eject the usurper from his dominion. "The prince of this
   world is (already) judged" (John xvi. 11). Sentence has been passed; a
   judgment summons has been issued (John xii. 31; xvi. 11); and execution
   is about to be put in (Rev. xii). But all this is here first shown to
   be in virtue of the "right" obtained by the payment of the redemption
   price: that is why John sees a Lamb as "having been slain."

   Past payment is the basis of future power (Col. ii. 15. Heb. ii. 14).
   This it is which established the worthiness of the true Goel. The horns
   of the Lamb speak of His power (I Sam. ii. 1. 2 Sam. xxii. 3. Ps. lxxv.
   4; cxxxii. 17; cxlviii. 14. Lam. ii. 3. Ezek. xxix. 21. Dan. viii. 5,
   20, 21, etc.). This power is Divine and has a spiritual and almighty
   agency able to carry it out. The seven eyes, Zech. iv. 10 and iii. 9,
   denotes the fact that the Lord is about to remove the iniquity of the
   Land of Israel.

   7. And He came and took it [148] out of the right hand of Him who
   sitteth upon the throne]      Thus ends the member which has for its
   subject "The Throne and the Book; the Lion and the Lamb." It
   corresponds with Dan. vii. 9-14, where the Son of Man is seen coming to
   the Ancient of Days and receiving a kingdom, dominion, and glory; and
   it is this which is immediately celebrated in the New Song which
   follows in chap. v. 8-14, concluding this first Vision "In Heaven."



   B., chap. v. 8-14.

   THE NEW SON OF THE ZOA AND ELDERS.

   The Theme -- Redemption.

   The last member of C^1 is now reached. In the structure it is marked B,
   and consists of chap. v. 8-14 the subject being, "The New Song of the
   Zoa, and the elders, and the heavenly utterances of other Angelic
   Beings."

   It is arranged in orderly sequence; the speakers and their utterances
   being separated and placed in five pairs, or groups.

   EXPANSION OF B., chap. v. 8-14.

   The New Song of the Zoa, Elders and others.

   B | q^1 | 8, 9-.  The Four Zoa, and 24 Elders.
               r^1 | -9, 10.  Their New Song.
        q^2 | 11, 12.  Many Angels.
               r^2 | -12.  Their Utterance.

        q^5 | -14-.  The 24 Elders.
               r^5 | -14.  Their Utterance.

   Here, in q^1 to q^5 we have the heavenly speakers and singers; while,
   in r^1 to r^5 we have their song and their utterances. The latter
   relate to the scene which has just taken place "in heaven," and to the
   result of it about to be seen in the consequent judgments which follow
   and take place "on earth." The point at which the heavenly voices
   commence is the moment when the Lamb, who alone is entitled and worthy
   takes the Book.

   8. And when He took the Book the four Zoa and the four and twenty
   elders fell down before the Lamb having each a harp [149] , and golden
   bowls full of incenses which are the prayers of the Saints]     In the
   Old Testament, the harp is associated with joy and gladness (see 1
   Chron. xxv. 1, 6; 2 Chron. xxix. 25; Ps. lxxi. 22; xcii. 3; cxlix. 3);
   just as sadness is expressed by the absence of it: "The joy of the harp
   ceaseth" (Isa. xxiv. 8). Harps were also specially associated with
   prophecy (1 Sam. x. 5; 1 Chron. xxv. 3; Ps. xlix. 4).

   The golden bowls were vessels belonging to the altar (Zech. xiv. 20),
   and the Septuagint uses the word for the vessels of the Temple (1 Kings
   vii. 45, 50; 2 Chron. iv. 22; Ex. xxv. 23-29; xxvii. 3; xxxvii. 10-16).
   The "prayers of the saints" are the prayers referred to by our Lord in
   the parable of the Judge, where He applies the parable Himself and asks
   "and shall not God avenge His own elect which cry day and night with
   Him though He bear long with them? I tell you that He will avenge them
   speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh shall he find faith
   (Gr. the faith) on the earth?" (Luke xviii. 7, 8). The faith here
   spoken of is that referred to in Rev. ii. 19; xiii. 10; xiv. 12. These
   elect are the saints spoken of and referred to in Matt. xxiv. 31, and
   Dan. vii. 18, 22, 27. They are the "Saints of the Most High"; the Most
   High being a Divine title, always used in connection with the earth;
   and not with the church. The Elders perform priestly service, because
   it is on behalf of others. This, the Church cannot do. If the "Elders"
   are the Church, then the "Saints" cannot be, for the Church cannot
   offer for itself; nor can one part of it offer for another part! No!
   The Church is "all one in Christ Jesus," and cannot be separated or
   divided.

   9. and they sing a New Song, saying]     The Zoa speak only in this
   first Vision "in Heaven" and in the last, in chap. xix. 4; and no where
   else. The Elders speak in the first and last, but also a third time in
   xi. 17. This is significant; as showing the weight and importance of
   those utterances respectively. In this first vision "in Heaven" their
   voices are heard twice: First, in connection with the Throne and Him
   who sitteth thereupon (separately); for the Zoa speak first (iv. 8);
   and the Elders follow (iv. 11); their theme being Creation. The second
   time they speak it is in connection with the Lamb, and the Book, they
   sing together (chap. v. 9, 10), their theme being Redemption.

   Six times in this first Vision "in Heaven," these Heavenly Voices are
   heard. All Heaven is engaged in singing the worthiness of God as the
   Creator; and the worthiness of the Lamb as the Redeemer. Surely these
   are the dominant personages of the whole Book. These are the themes
   which form its subject: viz., the removal of the curse from creation,
   the redemption of the purchased inheritance, the ejection of the great
   usurper; and all accomplished through the payment of Redemption's price
   by the merits of the Lamb, and the putting forth of Redemption power.
   Hence, in connection with Him and with the book we have the first of
   four heavenly utterances:

   The New Song of the Zoa and Elders. v. 9, 10.

   "Worthy art thou
   To take the Book,
   And to open the seals thereof,
   Because thou wast slain
   And didst purchase [150] a people for God by thy blood
   Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation
   And didst make them [151] to our God [152]
   A kingdom [153] and priests,
   And they reign [154] over the earth"]

   This is the theme of the New Song. The worthiness of the Lamb to take
   the Book, because of the Redemption He had accomplished. The People had
   been once redeemed from Egypt, for it is in connection with the Exodus
   that Redemption is first mentioned in the Bible, in the Song of Ex. xv.
   13. "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
   redeemed: Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto thy holy
   habitation." But now the People have been scattered among "every
   kindred and tongue, and people and nation," and therefore they must be
   redeemed from these, "the second time," "like as it was to Israel in
   the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt" (Is. ix. 11, 16).

   The importance of the various readings in verse 9 will be seen, and
   noted; because upon this turns very much the interpretation of the
   whole Book. The true reading separates the singers from the Redeemed,
   and makes them heavenly beings who need no redemption, but who sing of
   the redemption wrought for others.

   But the payment of the price is only one part of the work of
   redemption. If the price be paid and there be no power to take
   possession and eject the holder the payment is in vain. And if power be
   put forth and exercised in casting out the usurper, without the
   previous payment of the redemption price, it would not be a righteous
   action. So that for the redemption of the forfeited inheritance two
   things are absolutely necessary, price and power. The first redemption
   song has for its theme the payment of the price. The second celebrates
   the putting forth of the power.

   We are first told by whom this second utterance is made.

   11. And I saw and heard [155] the voice of many angels around the
   throne, and of the Zoa, and of the elders, and the number of them was
   myriads of myriads [156] saying with a loud voice
       "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain,
       To receive power
           and riches
           and wisdom
           and strength
           and honour
           and glory
           and blessing"]

   They give this sevenfold ascription as to the Lamb's worthiness. The
   words "Power" and "Strength" divide the seven into three and four.
   These are all marked off by the Figure Polysyndeton (i.e., the use of
   "many ands") which bids us consider each of these seven features of the
   Lamb's worthiness separately. In doing this we are to note that the
   great theme is Redemption power and strength.

   13. And every creature which is in heaven and on [157] the earth and
   beneath the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them
   heard I saying
       "To Him that sitteth upon the throne
       And to the Lamb
           Blessing
           and honour
           and glory
           and might
           For ever and ever"]

   This is the ascription of the whole creation. Hence it is four-fold
   because it is in connection with the earth ( of which four is the
   number) and because He who sitteth upon the Throne is there in relation
   to the earth. Whereas the ascription to the Person of the Lamb slain is
   seven-fold because Redemption blood was offered "through the eternal
   Spirit" (Heb. ix. 14).

   14. And the four Zoa said
                           "Amen"
   and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped [158] ]

   It seems almost profane to attempt to explain, and comment on these
   heavenly utterances. They are Heaven's own comment on the wondrous
   facts seen and heard by John, and brought before us in this first
   vision seen "in heaven." When again He brings the First-born into the
   world, He said "And let all the angels of God worship Him" (Heb. i. 6).
   This is the Septuagint rendering of Deut. xxxii. 43, the closing words
   of the Song of Moses. And why are all the nations there called on to
   "Rejoice," and why are all the angels of God called on to worship Him?
   Because He is about to fulfil the threat He there pronounced and
   records:

   "FOR He will avenge the blood of His servants,
   And will render vengeance to His adversaries,
   And will be merciful to His Land,
   And to His people."

   These are the concluding words of "the song of Moses." Now, "the whole
   creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together" (Rom. viii. 22), but
   then, when the day to sing this song of Moses shall have come, and the
   glory of the Lord shines once more upon Israel, then the song will be
   in the words written:

   "His way will be known upon earth
   And His saving health will be made known among all nations:
   Then shall the nations be glad and sing for joy.
   Then shall our land yield her increase" (Ps. lxvii).

   "The trees of the wood shall rejoice" (Ps. xcvi).

   "The floods shall clap their hands
   And the hills shall be joyful together" (Ps. xcviii).

   "The beast of the field:
   The fowl of the air:
   And the fish of the sea:
   And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea, shall say,
   'Oh Jehovah Adonai, how excellent is Thy name in all the EARTH'" (Ps.
   viii).

   "And everything that hath breath" shall praise the Lord (Ps. cl) and
   say
               HALLELUJAH

   E^1, chap. vi. 1-- 8. The Six Seals, and the sealing of the 144,000


   From the whole of the first Vision "in Heaven" (H^1, vi. 1-vii. 8) for
   the putting forth of power "on Earth" in the completion of the
   redemption of the purchased inheritance. The price has been paid in the
   shedding of the precious blood of the Lamb; and now, the necessary
   power is to be exercised so as to secure all its wondrous results, in
   wresting the inheritance from the hand of the enemy by ejecting the
   present usurper, and forcibly taking possession. We see this power put
   forth in the Seals, Trumpets, and Vials which fill up the active
   judgments of God in accomplishing this: and which end with the coming
   of the Lord Himself (xix).

   This is the great object set forth in the preceding Vision "in Heaven";
   and now we are to see the result of it all as consequent on it "on
   Earth."

   John sees it all, of course, "in Heaven," but what he saw (vi. 1- vii.
   8) "in Heaven" will take place "on Earth," just as what he sees (chaps.
   iv. and v.) as taking place "in Heaven," does and will take place
   there.

   This is the first Vision of what will take place "on Earth" in "the day
   of the Lord." The great subject is

   THE OPENING OF THE SIX SEALS.

   For the Six Seals are separated off from the seventh in a remarkable
   manner; as though to point out to us that the seventh is not
   immediately consecutive on the sixth, as the other seals are
   consecutive one on the other.

   The sixth seal evidently carries us forward to the time of the end; for
   it speaks of the signs in the sun and moon and stars (vi. 12, 13),
   which the Lord associates with His personal appearance (Matt. xxiv. 29.
   See Joel ii. 28, 31, where it is called "the great and terrible day of
   the Lord," as though it were the climax of the whole period known as
   "the day of the Lord"). It is called in the sixth seal "the great day
   of His wrath" (vi. 17), and the signs in heaven are the great final
   scene (vi. 14) as described in 2 Pet. iii. 10.

   If this be so, then these first six seals are separated, very
   definitely, from the seventh; and the silence in heaven which follows
   the opening of the seventh indicates a pause.

   The six seals present us with a preliminary summary of the judgments,
   which cover the whole period; the sixth leading up to and ending in the
   actual coming of Christ; or, at any rate, to the end of chapter xviii.

   There is every reason to believe that "the day of the Lord" will be a
   prolonged period. It must not be confined to "seven years," as is so
   often done. The time between the coming forth of the Lord into the air
   to meet His Church, and His coming unto the Earth with His Church, in
   power and great glory, may correspond to the thirty-three years between
   His coming forth at Bethlehem (Micah v. 2) and His coming unto
   Jerusalem (Zech. ix. 9). All the events between those two we speak of
   as constituting His "first coming." In like manner, all the events
   described in this Book, which take place between His coming "for" and
   His coming "with" His Church, we may speak of as "His second coming" or
   "the day of the Lord." [See [7]THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST'S ADVENT]

   These events may occupy a similar period of thirty-three years for
   aught we know; and if to these we add the seven yeas of the last week
   of Daniel we have a period of forty years.

   We do know that in Matt. xxiv. 4-6, in answer to the first question of
   the disciples, "When shall these things be," i.e., when the temple
   should be destroyed, the Lord at once adds, "not yet is the end
   (telos)."

   He then goes on to answer the second question, "What shall be the sign
   of thy coming, and of the Sunteleia of the age?" (verse 3). He
   describes four of those seals (verse 7), and adds "all these are a
   beginning of sorrows."

   This fixes these earlier seals as the "beginning" of the Sunteleia of
   "the day of the Lord" -- this "beginning" may be spread over some years
   before the Great Tribulation, proper, comes on.

   Thus these first six seals are again separated off from the seventh.

   We now give the first vision, E^1, vi. 1- vii. 8, showing the events on
   Earth, as a whole.

   It will be seen that they are divided between two subjects -- the
   persecutors and the persecuted: Those who are on the side of Antichrist
   (B1 and B2); and those who suffer (A2), or have immunity from suffering
   (A3), for refusing to worship him, etc.

   It will be noted also how perfectly Matt. xxiv. corresponds with this
   first scene on earth -- the whole summary of the Sunteleia and the
   Telos. [See [8]THE PROMISES TO THE SEVEN ASSEMBLIES]

   E^1, vi. 1 - vii. 8.  The Six Seals and the Sealing.

   E^1 | A^1 | vi. 1, 2.  The False Christ going forth to make war on the
   saints. (1st Seal).  Matt. xxiv. 4, 5.
                   B^1 | vi. 3-8.  Judgments on him and his followers.
   (2nd, 3rd, and 4th Seals).  Matt. xxiv. 6, 7.
           A^2 | vi. 9-11.  the effects of the war with the saints. Their
   martyrdom. (5th Seal).  Matt. xxiv. 8-28.
                   B^2 | vi. 12-17.  Judgments on him and his followers.
   (6th Seal.)  Matt. xxiv. 29-30.  And Question, "Who shall be able to
   stand?"
           A^3 | vii. 1-8.  Answer to Question, by the Sealing of 144,000
   enabling them to stand in the judgment  (Matt. xxiv. 31).


   We want our readers to understand clearly our suggestion as to these
   Seals. We separate them off from the Trumpets and Vials, which are
   continuous once they begin. This is shown from the fact, as will be
   seen below, that, the last two Trumpets and the first Vial are linked
   together as being the "three woes." They are thus marked as
   consecutive.

   The Seals, however, we feel compelled, by the events under the sixth,
   to regard as a summary of ALL the Divine judgments which will usher in
   the Day of the Lord: including the whole of the Sunteleia, "the
   Tribulation," and leading up to the Telos or end, -- the last "seven
   years," and "the great day of His wrath." Thus they cover the whole
   period in broad outline. After the last Seal there is a break, shown by
   the "silence in heaven," and we are turned aside to see some further
   details as to these judgments -- beginning, may we say de novo, with
   the Trumpets. After the last Trumpet there is no such break, no
   "silence in heaven" or on earth, but the last Trumpet at once ushers in
   and contains and developes the final judgments of the seven Vials,
   which finish up the mystery or secret purpose of God; for, we read in
   Rev. x. 7 that "in the days of the seventh angel, when he shall begin
   to sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to
   his servants the prophets." The seventh Trumpet expands into the seven
   Vials, and these end with the final destruction of Babylon, which
   closes up these earthly judgment scenes.

   We will now give a summary of the first four Seals. A1 and B1, vi. 1-8:

   A^1 and B^1, vi. 1-8.  The Four Seals.

   A^1 & B^1 | a | vi. 1, 2.  The First Seal.  White Horse.  The rider
   with bow in hand. (Matt. xxiv. 5).
                           b | vi. 3, 4.  The Second Seal.  Red Horse.
   War (Matt. xxiv. 6, 7-).
                    a | vi. 5, 6.  The Third Seal.  Black Horse. Famine.
   The rider, balances in hand. (Matt. xxiv. -7-).
                           b | vi. 7, 8.  The Fourth Seal.  The Livid
   Horse.  Pestilence. (Matt. xxiv. -7-).


   A1 (vi. 1, 2) The First Seal.

   vi. 1. And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven [159] seals, and
   I heard one of the four Zoa saying, as with a voice of thunder -- Go!
   [160]

   2. And I saw and lo! a white horse, and he that was sitting upon it,
   having a bow, and there was given unto him a crown ((...) stephanos), a
   triumphal crown), and he went forth conquering, and in order that he
   might conquer or overcome]     If we interpret these Seals by the words
   of Christ in Matt. xxiv., where He is describing this very time in
   answer to the disciples' questions, there can be no doubt as to their
   meaning and reality. His very first words relate to the false Christs
   who shall appear as the sign when these things should be (i.e., when
   the Temple should be destroyed). And so it was; but these were only the
   prelude to what should mark "the beginning of sorrows." These should
   begin, not by many "false Christs," but by one, who should give it out
   and say:
           "I am the Messiah,
           and he shall deceive many"
   (Matt. xxiv. 5). This first Seal, therefore, must mark the first rising
   of this False Christ. This is the silent secret preliminary intimation
   of his going forth. Further details of this are given in Rev. xiii.,
   where it is expressly said that "it was given to him to make war with
   the saints and to overcome them, and there was given to him authority
   over every tribe and people [161] , and tongue and nation, and all who
   dwell on the earth shall do homage to him whose names have not been
   written (in the book of life of the Lamb slain) from the foundation of
   the world" (Rev. xiii. 7,8). It seems impossible to separate this from
   the rider on the white horse (in vi. 1, 2), for we read of him in like
   manner that "it was given to him" to wear a crown, and to go forth and
   overcome. How the Lamb who opens the seal can be the effect of the
   opening, and at the same time be the rider on a white horse, we cannot
   understand. If, on the other hand, we see in this rider an imitation of
   the "faithful and true" Messiah when He comes forth on a white horse to
   really conquer, as described in Rev. xix. 11, then, how natural for the
   false and deceiving Messiah to go forth in a manner that will be most
   calculated to "deceive many." It is one of the curiosities of
   interpretation, first to understand the Zoa of the Church, and then
   make the rider of the first Seal to be Christ; thus making one member
   of the Church give the order to Christ to go forth in His judgment
   power! How much more simple, taking Christ's words in Matt. xxiv. as
   the key, to leave the Zoa alone, and regard them as spiritual or
   heavenly beings specially interested in the judgments about to come on
   the earth, and giving the authority to the False Christ to go forth and
   be "revealed in his time," just as Christ said to Judas, "That thou
   doest, do quickly" (John xiii. 27). All the other horses are judgment
   horses: why inconsistently break up this uniformity and single out one
   Rider as Divine and take the others as human? Why understand one as
   going forth in grace, and the others in judgment?

   The descriptions of Antichrist's career in other Scriptures coincide
   entirely with this. He rises unrecognised by the dwellers on the earth.
   His beginning is "Peace," but his aim is universal dominion, which he
   finally acquires. When his downfall comes, the reflection of beholders
   will be:-- "Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did
   shake kingdoms; that made the world a wilderness, and destroyed the
   cities thereof" (Isa. xiv. 16, 17). In Daniel it is said that "his
   power shall be might... that he shall destroy wonderfully" (Dan. viii.
   24) and that "he shall stretch forth his hand upon the countries" (Dan.
   xi. 36, 42).

   As to the Command, the obedience to it "and he went forth," shows that
   the verb (...) (erchomai) to come, or go, must be taken in the latter
   sense, "Go!" Or else the second occurrence of the verb would be "and he
   came forth." The commission "given to him" concerned war, as the second
   seal goes on to explain. Horses are specially associated with war. See
   Job. xxxix. 19, 25; Prov. xxi. 31 ("the horse is prepared against the
   day of battle"). So Ps. lxxvi. 6; Zech. ix. 10; x. 3; Jer. vi. 23; Isa.
   xliii. 17. But because the rider on the white horse in Rev. xix is
   Christ, that is no reason why the rider on the white horse, chap. vi.,
   should be Christ also, especially as in this very same verse we have
   Him already represented as a Lamb, who opens this seal in order that
   the white horse may be sent forth.

   We need not trouble ourselves to show that this white horse is not the
   Roman Empire, as some hold; or Rome itself, as Mr. Elliott believes.
   Nor can we ask our readers to believe that the "Bow" in the rider's
   hand symbolises the island of Crete. We do not need a knowledge of the
   Classics or of History in order to understand this Book; but we do need
   a knowledge of Scripture; not to say common sense.


   The Second Seal (vi. 3, 4).

   vi. 3. And when He opened the second seal I heard the second Zoon
   saying, Go! [162] 4. And there went forth another horse, fiery
   coloured; and to him who sat upon it was given power to take away peace
   from the earth, and that men should slay one another: and there was
   given to him a great sword]     That this relates to the whole earth,
   and not merely to the Land, seems to be determined by our Lord's
   reference to the subject of the second seal, in Matt. xxiv. 6,7: "And
   ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars... and nations shall rise
   against nation, and kingdom against kingdom." These words, coupled with
   the second seal, point to a general break up of the nations in the
   process of their absorption into Antichrist's universal kingdom. In
   Ezekiel xxxviii. 21, it is written: "I will call for a sword against
   him throughout all my mountains, saith Jehovah Adonai: Every man's
   sword shall be against his brother." Jer. xxv. tells of this second
   seal; when God has His controversy with the nations. Read from verse
   15-33, and note verse 29: "I will call for a sword upon all the
   inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts... for the Lord hath
   a controversy with the nations; He will give them that are wicked to
   the sword, saith the Lord" (verse 31). Against Israel also comes the
   sword, "I will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of
   my covenant" (Lev. xxvi. 25-33). The "sword" is one of God's "four sore
   judgments" sent upon the earth (Ezek. xiv. 13-21).

   "There was given unto him." We must note well these significant words.
   They are spoken of the first rider on the white horse; and similarly of
   all the judgments. All are initiated from the throne. It will be again,
   as it was in another period of Israel's history in the days of Asa, "In
   those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that
   came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the
   countries, and nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city; for
   God did vex them with all adversity" (2 Chron. xv. 5, 6). Such another
   time is described by Josephus (Wars, Bk. ii. xviii. 2, 1, 5). No new
   thing is referred to in this second seal. The whole of Micah vii.
   should be read. It is too long to be quoted here. But we may quote Dan.
   xi. 33, "and they that understand among the people shall instruct many;
   yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by
   spoil, many days." Surely we have in these scriptures that which
   explains, sufficiently, the second seal; and shall not be likely to
   accept such an interpretation as Mr. Elliott offers when he says that
   this second rider symbolises the praetorian prefects of Rome. Upon this
   it will be sufficient to remark that the sword was "given" by the Roman
   Emperor with the view of preserving peace in the earth and not with the
   object of taking peace away from the earth, as here stated!

   It may be well to add that up to the third century this was not
   considered to have been fulfilled by any historical events. So Origen
   says in his Commentary on St. Matthew (Cap. xxiv.).

   The Third Seal (vi. 5, 6).

   vi. 5. And when he opened the third seal I heard the third Zoon saying,
   Go! [163] And I beheld, and lo! a black horse, and he who was sitting
   upon it having a pair of balances in his hand. 6. And I heard as [164]
   it were a voice in the midst of the four Zoa, saying,
           "A choenix of wheat for a denarius,
           and three choenixes of barley for a
           denarius: and see, thou mayest not
           injure the oil and the wine"]

   This is the next judgment mentioned by the Lord in Matt. xxiv. -7-,
   "and there shall be famine: for this is what "black" denotes. (See Lam.
   iv. 4-8; v. 10; Jer. xiv. 1, 2). In former times it was God who called
   for a famine. See 2 Kings viii. 1. So in prophecy. Hag. i. 11; ii. 16,
   17; Jer. xvi. 4.

   The "balances" some would translate "yoke"; and because yokes are
   generally worn by oxen, and not carried in a horseman's hand,
   commentators make it a spiritual yoke and a spiritual famine! though
   they leave us to wonder what a spiritual famine has to do with weights
   and measures and the price of wheat and barley. We prefer what is so
   evidently the simple meaning of the words. Bread "by weight" always
   denotes scarcity. When God describes, through Ezekiel, the famine
   during the siege of Jerusalem, He says, "Thy meat which thou shalt eat
   shall be by weight... and drink water by measure." (Read Ezek. iv. 10,
   16, 17). This is exactly what the mysterious voice (in the midst of the
   four Zoa) declares. Famines may occur from secondary causes, but the
   first cause of this Famine is from "the throne." The extent is
   fore-known -- "A choenix of wheat for a denarius." We know from Matt.
   xx. 2, 9 that a denarius (the value of which was about 7 1/4d.) was a
   day's wage; and we know also that a choenix of corn (about 2 pints) was
   the daily ration for a slave (Odyss. xix. 27, 28; Athen. iii. 20;
   Herod. vi. 57; vii. 187, 231; Xen. Anab. i. 5, 6; Thucyd. iv. 16).

   The usual price of a choenix was 1/8th of a denarius; so that corn,
   here, in this famine, is eight times its usual price. We are told that
   a denarius would buy 16 choenixes of wheat in the time of Cicero, and
   20 in the time of Trajan. There will be great scarcity, therefore, when
   a denarius will buy only one.

   Literal famines have been so often foretold, and have come to pass,
   from Genesis onward (2 Kings vi. 25; vii. 1; Acts xi. 28). Why should
   not this famine in Revelation be literal also? And yet interpreters
   seem determined to make this anything except a literal famine. Some, as
   we have said, make it spiritual wrongly applying Amos viii. 11, 12.
   "Injure not the oil and wine" is literal; and the Lord Himself,
   speaking of the beginning of these very sorrows, says, "there shall be
   famines." Corn, oil, and wine are three words often linked together to
   give the idea of plenty. (See Deut. xi. 14; xxviii. 51).

   Mr. Elliott, in his Horae Apocalypticae, has to make it accord with the
   requirements of history, and says "there is nothing correspondent with
   such era of famine" (vol. i., p. 149). One would have thought,
   therefore, that the best plan would be to abandon the historical
   interpretation. But no! history must stand, and the Scripture (the
   voice from the Throne) must be accommodated to it. So Mr. Elliott first
   insists on a larger choenix; but afterwards, finding this could not be
   sustained, he changes his ground in a third edition of his commentary,
   and takes refuge in a smaller or "adulterated denarius"! He actually
   says, "I was not aware of this adulteration when printing my two former
   editions; and so resorted to a larger and more uncommon choenix, in
   order to answer the statement of price in the prophecy." We admire the
   candour of this confession, but we must condemn the principle of
   interpretation which requires it. We prefer our Lord's own clear, but
   simple, words, "there shall be famines" (Matt. xxiv. 7)! This position
   we shall never have to relinquish in order to resort to another.


   The Fourth Seal (vi. 7, 8).

   vi. 7. And when he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the
   fourth Zoon, saying Go! [165] 8. And I saw, and behold, a livid horse,
   and he who wassitting upon it, his name was Death; and the Grave (Gr.
   Hades) followed after him: And authority was given to them over the
   fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword, and with famine and
   with pestilence, and by the wild beasts of the earth]    This is the
   result of opening the Fourth Seal; and it is the fourth judgment
   mentioned by our Lord in Matt. xxiv. 7, "pestilences."

   Though the word in the Greek here is (...) (thanatos) death, it is put,
   by Metonymy, as the effect for the cause producing it, which is
   pestilence. In the O.T. it is the Septuagint rendering of (...) (dever)
   destruction, i.e., plague and pestilence, which causes death. It occurs
   some thirty times, as in 1 Kings viii. 37; Jer. xiv. 12; xxi. 7. We
   call the oriental plague which raged in Europe in the 14th century the
   "black death" by the same Figure.

   "Pestilence," thus personified, is followed by the grave (Gr. Hades),
   also personified. The two words occur together because the latter
   depends on the former. See i. 18; vi. 8; xx. 13; 1 Cor. xv. 55; and
   Isa. xxvii. 15, 18. Hades follows in the train of Death, because Death
   ends in the Grave. Hence the authority is given to them jointly.

   Tradition has thrown obscurity over what is otherwise so clear. What is
   it that always follows death? Surely it is the grave. In chap. xx. 13
   we read "Death and the grave (Gr. Hades) gave up the dead which were in
   them," i.e., the dead held by them were raised to life. Hades is the
   place which holds the dead; and Christ, who raises the dead, is
   therefore said to hold the keys of Hades, or the grave. The word Hades
   occurs eleven times in the New Testament, and there is no place where
   the rendering grave would not be appropriate. [166] Grave being
   generally put (by Metonymy) not for one single grave; but for all
   graves viewed as a whole; or, as we might call it Grave-dom. The
   commission of "Death" has relation to "the beginning of sorrows" in
   Matt. xxiv. 8, which are there, and here, said to be "wars, famines and
   pestilences." These are the agencies used by "Death" (personified); and
   these are naturally followed by the common result -- the grave.

                  shall be brought down to the grave.

   Matt. xvii. 18

                  The gates of Hades shall not prevail.

   Luke xii. 5

                  shalt he thrust down to the grave.

   Luke xvi. 23

                  In the grave he lift up his eyes.

   Acts ii. 27

                  wilt not leave my soul (i.e., me) in the grave.

   Acts ii. 31

                  his soul (i.e., he) was not left in the grave.

   2 Cor. xv. 55

                  O grave, where is thy victory.

   Rev. i. 18

                  have the keys of death and the grave.

   Rev. vi. 8

                  Death, and the grave followed

   Rev. xx. 13, 14

                  Death and the grave.


    "Wild beasts" are added as another agency, because they consume the
   wounded and dying, and seize on those who are left defenceless (Num.
   xxi. 6; Ez. xxxiii. 27; Lev. xxvi. 22; Deut. xxxii. 24; Josh. xxiv. 12;
   2 Kings xvii. 25; ii. 24; Ezek. xiv. 21; Jer. v. 6; Is. xxx. 6 [167] ).
   These three -- "sword, famine and pestilence," are frequently found
   together (Jer. xiv. 12; xxi. 7; xxiv. 10; xliv. 13; Ezek. vi. 11, 12;
   v. 12, &c.); and joined, as here, with wild beasts, as in Ezek. xiv.
   21. Three of these were offered to David in 1 Chron. xxi. 12.

   The meaning of these three Seals seems to be simple and clear. They are
   the expansion of our Lord's own brief statement in Matt. xxiv. 7, which
   shows that we have here, "the beginning of sorrows." In other words,
   wars with their usual accompaniments, famine and plague, and ravenous
   beasts will be commissioned to commence the assault on the earthy
   portion of Satan's gathering forces.

   When these three judgments fail, then the Lord will bring up others
   from His reserved forces. Not until the sixth seal, which, as we have
   seen, carries us forward to the time of the end of sorrows, do the men
   of the earth own these judgments as proceeding from God as their
   author.

   We must repeat here that not one of these Seals has yet been opened.
   Nor can any period of history be pointed out in which these "four sore
   judgments" have been in operation simultaneously over the extent here
   named, "the fourth part of the earth."

   Gibbon's description [168] of the reign of Justinian, about 550 A.D.,
   shows how possible it will be to have such a wide-spread scene of
   judgment.

   The Fifth Seal (vi. 9-11).

   The fifth Seal is marked off and separated from all the others. It
   stands alone, giving us another side of the picture. The first Seal
   shows the mighty agency employed by Satan as the earthly leader of the
   earthly portion of his gathering host. The action of these Satanic
   forces is assumed by the next three Seals (the second, third, and
   fourth), inasmuch as they are directed against Satan's opposing forces.

   In this earthly conflict there can be only suffering and martyrdom for
   those on the earth who hold and maintain the testimony of the Word of
   God, i.e., who adhere to the special truth communicated in this book
   and its contents, as defined in i. 2, 9; xii. 17. In chap. xx. 4, this
   is further explained as not worshipping the Beast or receiving his mark
   upon their foreheads.

   The two mighty forces have joined in hostilities; the opposing hosts
   have met; and those who are on the Lord's side suffer in consequence.

   Hence, in the fifth Seal, we have this episode introduced to make the
   whole complete, and give all sides of the great conflict.

   The first four Seals are connected together by each commencing with a
   cry from one of the four Zoa, and the going forth of a horseman.

   The remaining three are thus marked off as a separate series.

   The first series of four has to do with men as such. In the first of
   the second series we have the saints of the Most High.

   The order of our Lord's great prophecy (Matt. xxiv.) is still closely
   followed. In verses 6-8 He had spoken of (1) war, (2) famine and (3)
   pestilences "the beginning of sorrows"; and then in verse 9 He
   immediately goes on to say "THEN shall they deliver you up to be
   afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all the
   Gentiles for my name's sake." These words of our Lord (verses 9-28) are
   the key to the fifth seal.

   c. vi. 9. The Martyrs under the Altar. Their Description.

   vi. 9. And when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the
   persons (souls being put by Synecdoche for persons. See notes below) of
   those who had been slain on account of the word of God, and on account
   of the testimony which they held]    All mystery is removed if we
   simply take the word "souls" here as being put, by the figure
   Synecdoche for persons. By this figure a part is put for the whole.
   This is called "Synecdoche of the part." By it, the head is put for the
   man himself (2 Kings ii. 3; Ps. iii. 3; vii. 16; lxvi. 12; Prov. x. 6;
   Is. xxxv. 10). The face is put the for whole person, Gen. iii. 19; xix.
   21; 2 Sam. xvii. 11; 1 Kings ii. 16; x. 24, &c. The eye is put for the
   whole person (Matt. xiii. 16; 1 Cor. ii. 9). So the mouth (Prov. viii.
   13). The belly (Rom. xvi. 18; Phil. iii. 19). The heart also (Gen.
   xxxi. 20; Luke xxi. 34, &c.). The feet (Prov. i. 16; vi. 18; Is. liii.
   7; Rom. iii. 15). In like manner the hand; we put the "hand" for the
   whole person when we speak of so many hands being employed. "Body" is
   put for person, especially in the case of slaves, Ex. xxi. 3; Rev.
   xviii. 13. We believe that this same figure is used here in Rev. vi. 9.
   "Soul" is often put for person. When we say that the population
   consists of so many souls, we do not mean "soul" as distinct from body,
   but we mean so many persons. In Gen. xii. 5 we read of "the souls that
   they had gotten in Haran." In Gen. xiv. 21, the King of Sodom says
   "give me the souls (i.e., the captives), and take the goods." In Gen.
   xvii. 14, "that soul (i.e., that person) shall be cut off from his
   people." And so, very frequently, we have "the soul that sinneth it
   shall die." The word "soul" is frequently used of a person, [169] and
   is so translated.

   The word (...) (psuche) has no such fixed meaning as is put upon it by
   theology and tradition. It occurs in the New Testament 105 times, and
   is rendered life, 40 times; soul, 58 times; mind, 3 times; heart, once;
   with (...) heartily, once (Col. iii. 23); with (...) (humon) you, once
   (2 Cor. xii. 15 marg.); and with (...) (hemon) us, once (John x. 24).

   So there is no reason whatever for adhering to the traditional
   rendering, "soul," in this passage as denoting a part of man. The words
   simply mean "I saw those who had been slain." John also hears what they
   say. Speaking requires the organs of speech. Tongues are necessary.
   Vocal organs are indispensable for the utterance of words. These were
   the martyred saints personified and represented as waiting. They
   themselves were dead; for in Rev. xx. 4, John sees them again, and it
   says "they lived again" in the first resurrection. "The rest of the
   dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished" (Rev. xx.
   5). Why say "lived not again" if, all the time, they were alive in some
   other place. Moreover, how could "souls" wear white robes. We might as
   well speak of the eye, or the tongue, or the face, or any other part of
   the body wearing a white robe. If souls here are put for persons, then
   all is clear. John could see them, and hear them, and see what was
   given to them, and what was done to them as individuals. Even according
   to popular belief, "souls," as such, cannot be seen. There are no such
   things as material souls, able to talk without the bodily organs of
   speech.

   What John sees is a vision for the purpose of instructing him; just as
   Jotham's parable instructed the men of Israel when he represented trees
   as speaking.

   Moreover, the words "of them" give a wrong emphasis. The Greek is not
   so definite as that. John sees the martyred saints at the foot of the
   altar of burnt offering. He sees not animal victims, but human beings.
   Like sacrifices, they had been slain for their testimony. Not
   sacrifices of atonement, but of devotion. These were called
   "drink-offerings"; and the verb (...) (spendomai) is used of the
   pouring out of a drink offering. See Phil. ii. 17; and 2 Tim. iv. 6.

   Their condition here as dead is set in definite contrast to their
   condition when afterwards raised. Rev. xx. 4 shows that in vi. 9 they
   could not be reigning with Christ till they "lived again." Till then
   they must wait, as the answer to their cry declares. This brings us to


   d., vi. 10 Their Cry.

   vi. 10. And they cried with a loud voice (as Abel's blood was said to
   cry -- Gen. iv. 10), saying,
           "How long, O Sovereign-Lord,--
           The Holy and True]
   (iii. 7. 1 John v. 20). The word here rendered "Lord" in AV. and
   "Master" in RV. is a remarkable word. It is never used in the Church
   Epistles. The Greek is (...) (Despotes), from which we have our word
   Despot. [170] We could hardly use this word here; and prefer
   "Sovereign-Lord" as meaning more than merely "Master" of the RV., and
   denoting the great and sovereign disposer of the whole earth. A careful
   study of the passages where the Title occurs will not only throw light
   upon those passages; but will also serve to show that we have not here
   anything to do with the Church, or with any truly Christian martyr;
   but, with a special class of martyrs, who, in the days of the great
   tribulation, shall give a peculiar Testimony and suffer a peculiar
   Martyrdom. The other title, "Holy and True," is used in iii. 7, and
   belongs specially to God in relation to His covenant people. (Ps.
   lxxxix. 28, 34, 35. Isa. lv. 3).

   The Church of God in this day of grace does not, and cannot, cry for
   vengeance. Indeed, it is expressly taught not to do so (Rom. xii. 19).
   It is evident that these words are not appropriate to this present
   dispensation in which we are to love our neighbors as ourselves, and
   not to cry for vengeance upon them. But these martyrs are in quite
   another dispensation; and in one to which this cry is altogether
   appropriate and in harmony. By the use of the title Sovereign-Lord,
   they own His right to dispose of them as He will, and to do whatsoever
   He pleases in the heaven above and on the earth beneath.

               dost thou not judge and exact vengeance
               for our blood from [171] them that dwell upon the earth"]
   (Hos. iv. 1). This cry is, as we have said, appropriate to the coming
   Dispensation, as it was to the former. (See Ps. xiii. 1, 2; lxxix. 5,
   and many other Psalms). Indeed, the Song of Moses concludes with this
   blessed assurance on which this cry of faith is based (Deut. xxxii.
   43):--

   "Rejoice, O ye nations with his people;
           For he will avenge the blood of his servants,
           And will render vengeance to his adversaries,
   And will be merciful unto his Land and to his People"
   just as He avenged the blood of his "servants the prophets" on Ahab and
   Jezebel (2 Kings. ix. 7). When this present day of grace is over, then
   this cry will be consistent with the standing of those who utter it. We
   need to remember this great principle, and to rightly divide the
   Dispensations as to their nature and character.

   In Luke xviii. 1-8 we have a prophetic parable which cannot be
   understood if interpreted of the Church of God; but which is not only
   perfectly clear, if rightly divided as to its dispensational character,
   but most helpful in making us to understand better this fifth seal.

   It is the cry of Israel represented as a "widow." This cannot be the
   Church! But is specially the title applicable to Israel in a certain
   condition (Is. liv. 4, 5. Lam. i. 1). The cry, "Avenge me of mine
   adversary," cannot be used by any child of God, now.

   The break in our chapters severs the close connection between Luke
   xvii. and xviii. and separates the parable in Luke xviii. 1-8 from the
   coming of the kingdom treated of in Luke xvii. 20-end. The section
   commences with the question of the Pharisees as to "when the kingdom of
   God should come?" The Lord answers, "The kingdom of God cometh not with
   (hostile) watching (such as you practise. See the use of the verb, Luke
   vi. 7. Mark iii. 2. Luke xiv. 1. Acts ix. 24). Neither (he adds) shall
   they say, Lo here, or Lo there, for behold, the kingdom of God is in
   the midst of (RV. marg.) you (in the person of the king. It could not
   be within the hearts of his enemies who were seeking his life!).

   The Lord goes on to speak of the coming of the Son of Man to the end of
   the chapter, comparing it with the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
   connecting it with the very end of the Tribulation, as in Matt. xxiv.
   27, "as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the
   West; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For wheresoever
   the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together." (See job
   xxxix. 30.)

   Then the Lord goes on, in Luke xviii. 1-8, to describe the position of
   His servants during those terrible days, as one of waiting and prayer.
   Their cry for vengeance is almost identical with that which we hear
   under this fifth seal. He says, with reference to those days, that
   "they ought always to pray and not to faint" because their desire is
   not at once fulfilled (Luke xvii. 22).

   But now look at the Parable itself. "There was in a certain city
   (Jerusalem, Rev. xi. (cf. Is. i. 10). Ezek. xvi. 26, 46; xx. 7), a
   judge, who feared not God, neither regarded man; and there was a widow
   in that city." Widowhood is the condition of Israel. Though the mass of
   the nation may say, like Babylon, "I sit a queen, I am no widow" (Rev.
   xviii. 7), God speaks of her in her really desolate condition. The
   widow's "Adversary" can be none other than Antichrist, who persecutes
   this remnant in Jerusalem. We have the cry in Ps. lxxix. 1-3:
           "O God: the heathen are come unto thine inheritance:
           The holy Temple have they defiled;
           They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
           The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
   the fowls of the heaven:
           The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
           Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
           And there was none to bury them."

   This plainly refers to Rev. xi. And then comes the plaintive appeal
   verse 5.
           "How long, Lord, wilt thou be angry: for ever?
           Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?"

   The whole of this Psalm (lxxix.) should be read in this connection as
   well as other Psalms, such as x. and xi.; liv. 5; lv. 9; xciv.; xcliii.
   12, &c. See also Is. lxiii. 15, &c., and lxiv. It is beautiful to
   notice, how, after the Lord calls attention to the action of the unjust
   judge, He exultingly declares of Him that is Holy and True -- "And
   shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him,
   and he is longsuffering over them? I say unto you that he will avenge
   them speedily" (RV.).

   But he has to add, and to ask -- "Howbeit, when the Son of Man cometh
   shall he find faith (marg. the faith) on the earth?" (RV.) or, it may
   be in the Land, the Jewish Land, as at the first Advent.

   If we rightly divide the word of truth, as to its Dispensations, then
   we see that the imprecations and invocations for vengeance, while
   entirely opposed to the spirit of the present dispensation of grace,
   are quite appropriate to the past dispensation of works, and the future
   dispensation of judgment.

   Romanism, not rightly dividing the Dispensations, presses such
   Scriptures as these into her service now; using them to justify her
   persecutions. While Protestant interpreters, failing also in this
   important duty, have to explain such passages away, or endeavour in
   vain to reconcile them with our standing in grace.


   c., vi. 11-. The Martyrs under the Altar. What was given them.

   vi. 11-. And there was [172] given to each a white robe]    Even thus
   was the promise made in Rev. iii. 4, marking them as righteous, and as
   the servants of God. Robes of honour ever formed part of rewards. (See
   Gen. xli. 42; xlv. 22. Est. vi. 8, 9. Isa. iii. 7. Zech. iii. 5). The
   action implies that their request will be granted; and the words
   announce that there must be some delay before their desire can be
   accomplished.


   d., vi. -11. The Answer to their Cry.

   vi. -11. And it was said to them that they should rest (not merely
   desist from their cry; but wait) yet a little while (i.e., for a short
   delay, as in x. 6 and xx. 3) until both their fellow-servants (here we
   have the correlative of Despotes, as well as their own standing as
   "servants") and their brethren that were about to be killed, as they
   also had been, should fill up [173] the appointed number]    "Fellow
   servants and brethren" is the Figure Hendiadys, denoting not two
   separate classes of persons, but one class, viz., their fellow servants
   even those who were their brethren. This is to define who the fellow
   servants were; for angels can be called such (xix. 10; xxii. 9), but
   not "brethren." They will have been killed during the Tribulation for
   refusing to have the mark of the Beast or to worship him. This killing
   is afterwards seen in xiii. 7, 15; xvii. 6 by John in vision. Here it
   is revealed prophetically; for, as we have said, the Seals cover the
   whole period in brief, and in outline, the details being afterwards
   filled in by the Trumpets, and Vials.

   Surely this ought to be sufficient to convince all Christians to-day
   that the gospel is not intended to convert the world, or to bring in
   universal peace and blessing. This dispensation of grace (rejected) is
   to be followed by a dispensation of judgment.

   Not until after that shall Jerusalem be the centre of God's presence
   and government, and glory dwell in the Land (Ps. lxxxv. 9). Then shall
   Judah "dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. For
   I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the Lord
   dwelleth in Zion" (Joel iii. 20, 21. See also Isa. iv. 4 and Deut.
   xxxii. 43). When the appointed number is accomplished, judgment will be
   executed and be followed by the dispensation of glory.


   The Sixth Seal (vi. 12-17).

   In this sixth Seal we are carried right forward to the time of the end.
   The Seals, as we have said, are a summary, in brief, of the whole
   period of the Tribulation; and, as the former Seals correspond exactly
   with the last great prophecy of Christ in Matt. xxiv., so this sixth
   Seal also has its place in that chapter. We may thus exhibit the
   parallel:

   Matt. xxiv.

           Signs in Heaven of Advent

                                    12-17

   From this it will be seen how exactly Matt. xxiv. covers the whole
   period of the six Seals; and shows that this sixth Seal takes us up to
   the signs immediately preceding the Advent of the Lord in Glory, as
   seen in Rev. xix.

   This being so, it proves that any interpretation of this Seal which
   regards it as relating to any past historical event is condemned by
   this very fact.

   This sixth Seal is the crucial test of all Apocalyptic interpretation.

   No one can read Matt. xxiv. 30 with Rev. vi. 12-17 without seeing that
   they speak of the same event. The actual Advent of Christ is deferred,
   in Rev. vi., because it is to form a separate and special description
   by itself in chap. xix. The sixth Seal does not therefore include the
   visible appearing of the Son of man, though it is remarkable that,
   while (in A3) in Rev. vi. 13 we have the simile of a Fig Tree, and the
   sealing of the elect of Israel (vii. 1-8); so, in Matt. xxiv. 31 we
   have the gathering of the elect of Israel, and in verses 32, 33 we have
   the simile of the Fig Tree again. The Lord concludes this special
   prophecy of the Tribulation by adding "Verily, I say unto you, this
   generation shall not pass, till all these things begin to take place."
   Not "fulfilled." The word is (...) (genetai) from (...) (ginomai) to
   begin to be, to come to be, [174] and is quite different from (...)
   (pleroo), to fulfil. In Luke xxi. 32, which is the parallel passage, we
   have the former word, fulfilled. What the Lord really said was "this
   generation shall not pass till all these things begin to happen." And
   they did begin to take place during that very generation; for the
   period immediately following the Lord's death was marked by many coming
   and saying "I am Christ." But in order that we might clearly
   understand, Christ immediately adds, "The end is not yet" (Matt. xxiv.
   6).

   But now, to turn to the sixth Seal itself; we note first its Structure,
   which is as follows:--

   B^2, vi. 12-17.  The Sixth Seal.

   B^2 | e | vi. 12-.  The Great Convulsion.
                   f | -12, 13.  Effects in Heaven.
          e | 14-.  The Great Convulsion.
                   f | -14-17.  Effects on Earth.


   TRANSLATION OF B^2 vi. 12-17.

   vi. 12. And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and [175] a great
   convulsion took place, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
   and the full [176] moon became as blood; (13) and the stars of heaven
   fell unto the earth, as the fig tree casteth her untimely (or winter)
   figs when shaken by a mighty wind]

   Here we have the great convulsion of Nature, and its effects in the
   heavens. It is impossible for us to take this as symbolical; or as
   other than what it literally says. The difficulties of the symbolical
   interpretation are insuperable, while no difficulties whatever attend
   the literal interpretation. For according to some historicist
   interpreters [177] this Seal was fulfilled at the Conversion of
   Constantine. Heaven is taken as the symbol of the invented term
   "Political heaven"; but it ought to be called "Religious Heaven," as
   the events are supposed to be Christian. According to others [178] it
   was fulfilled in the French Revolution of 1798. As both of these cannot
   be right, Is it not better for us to believe what God says? In Hag. ii.
   6, 7, He has foretold the events of this seal, and has connected them
   as in Matt. xxiv. with the immediate Advent of the Son of Man:--
           "Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
           Yet once, it is a little while,
           And I will shake the heavens and the earth,
           And the sea and the dry land.
           And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
   shall come."

   Here the great convulsion of the sixth Seal is clearly foretold. We say
   "convulsion," because the word (...) (seismos) means much more than a
   mere earthquake, as the context clearly shows. There is to be a
   convulsion of the nations, which is spoken of as distinct from that of
   the heavens, and is to immediately precede the Revelation of Christ,
   and the glory of the Temple. Haggai again foretells it in chap. ii. 21,
   22 and again distinguishes between the heavens and the earth.

           "I will shake the heavens and the earth.
           And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms,
           And I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the
   Gentiles:
           And I will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them,"
   etc. (See also 2 Pet. iii. 7-13, and compare verse 7 with 2 Thess. i.
   8).

   Having spoken of the great convulsion and its effects in the heavens,
   the prophecy again speaks of the convulsion and its effects on the
   earth.

   14. And the [179] heaven parted asunder as a scroll rolling itself up;
   [180] and every mountain and island were moved out of their places]
   This is referred to in Matt. xxiv. 35, and is foretold in Isa. xxxiv. 4
   (read verses 1-5 and Isa. xiii. 6-13), where we have exactly the same
   phenomena described. If the sixth Seal means the conversion of
   Constantine, so must these passages in Isaiah.

   15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men (the civil officers
   of State), and the chief captains (the military officers), and the rich
   men, [181] and the mighty [182] men, and every bondman and [183] free
   man, hid themselves (running for shelter) into the caves and into the
   rocks of the mountains. (16) And they say to the mountains and to the
   rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on
   the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb." (17)Because the day -- the
   great day of His wrath is come, and who is able to stand?]    In
   connection with this we must read Ps. ii. 2; lxviii. 4; xcvii. 5. Isa.
   xxiv. 19-23; xxxiv. 12; ii. 10-22. Nahum i. 5. Heb. xii. 26. The Lord
   also refers to this in Luke xxiii. 30, quoting the very words of Hosea
   x. 8. Similar phenomena are again mentioned under the fourth Trumpet,
   and the seventh Vial (xvi. 20), showing that we have in the sixth Seal
   the preliminary announcement of that which will take place "immediately
   after the tribulation of those days" (Matt. xxiv. 29) and "immediately"
   before the personal Advent of Christ. To this agree the words of Joel
   ii. 31.

   In Rev. xix. 19 we have the marshalling of the forces which are here
   detailed.

   If the words describing the awful judgments of "the great day of His
   wrath" are to be interpreted of any past event in the history of the
   present dispensation, then what words are to describe the future
   judgments which the Old Testament foretells. Language seems useless for
   the purposes of revelation and instruction if, as we are told, "this
   Seal exhibits the overthrow of paganism" at the conversion of
   Constantine. Eusebius pictures that scene (lib. x.) as one of joy and
   gladness, and he likens it to the coming of the promised kingdom. There
   was no convulsion of nature in heaven or on earth; no fleeing to the
   mountains and the rocks; no cry of terror. The sun was bright and the
   sky was cloudless, instead of being "black as sackcloth of hair."

   We thus come to the end of the first six Seals. It is a summary of the
   judgments distributed over the whole book; a brief summary of what will
   occur in "the day of the Lord," up to the time of His actual Apocalypse
   or Unveiling in chap. xix.

   They are thus set here, in order to show us that these judgments do not
   arise from chance, but are all under Divine control. The great False
   Messiah of the first Seal cannot be revealed until the appointed moment
   shall have come and the voice from the throne gives the permissive
   command "Go!" The judgments cannot fall until the same command is
   given. Here we note the important connection between "the Throne" of
   chaps. iv. and v. see in "in Heaven" and the consequent summary (in the
   Seals) of all that takes place afterward "on earth."

   They lead up to "the great day of His wrath"; and the chapter ends with
   the solemn question, "Who is able to stand?"

   That question is answered in chap. vii. where we are shew first the
   sealing of 144,000 "of all the tribes of the children of Israel," who
   are to pass unscathed through that great tribulation; and the rapture
   of the great multitude which no man can number who are saved through it
   and out of it. These are not the Church of God, for they stand before
   the throne. They are not seated upon it. They are saved, of course,
   through the merits of the same precious blood of the Lamb. They are
   referred to in Isa. xxvi. 9, "when thy judgments are in the earth, the
   inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness." Where are these
   afterwards seen if not in the great multitude of Rev. vii.? (Read also
   Psa. lxiv. 7-10; cx.). The question, "Who shall be able to stand?" is
   now to be answered.


   THE SEALING OF THE 144,000
   (vi.. 1-8).
   The answer to the question of vi. 17.

   Few Scriptures have suffered more at the hands of Gentile Christians
   than this. Notwithstanding the fact that it concerns "all the tribes of
   the children of Israel," and that the twelve tribes are named
   separately, popular interpretation insists on taking them as meaning
   the Church of God.

   Any system of interpretation which has this for its foundation may be
   judged and condemned at the outset as not only useless, but
   mischievous. Such a system has been well described by Hooker as one
   "which changeth the meaning of words as alchemy doth, or would do, the
   substance of metals, making anything of what it listeth; and bringeth,
   in the end, all truth to nothing."

   It is perfectly clear that we have here the Divine plan and action for
   securing the Remnant of the nation of Israel through all the judgments
   and persecutions which shall characterise the Great Tribulation.

   The Vision, though seen after the Sixth Seal, really describes what
   will take place before chapter vi. and before a Seal is broken. Their
   number is not left to chance. God's declared counsels concerning this
   Remnant must stand. Hence it is by Divine decree that this purpose
   shall be secured at the outset.

   We are told here, therefore, of the means taken to secure this Divine
   purpose.

   The Structure is as follows:--

   A^3, vii. 1-8.  The Sealing of the 144,000.
   The answer to the question of vi. 17.

   A^3 | g | vii. 1-.  Four angels.
               h | -1-.  Place. "Four corners of the earth...
                   i | -1-.  Agency.  "Holding the four winds...
                       k | -1.  Purpose (neg.).  "Not blow on earth, sea,
   or tree."
           g | 2-.  Another angel.
               h | -2-.  Place.  "From the rising of the sun...
                   i | -2, 3-.  Agency.  "Having the seal...
                       k | -3-8.  Purpose (neg.).  "Hurt not the earth,
   sea, or tree."


   All is seen to be perfect in Divine order. Nothing is left to chance
   here any more than in what is described. All is alike perfect in the
   words and the works of God. And the record is as true as its structure
   is perfect. It requires no explanation. It explains Divine truth to us
   in a Divine form and manner.


   TRANSLATION OF vii. 1-8.

   vii. 1 [and] [184] after this [185] ]    Showing that the former vision
   is complete, and the two visions which follow, commencing with similar
   words, come in by way of episode: the first, anterior in time to the
   Seals; and the second, during the period of the Seals, and later in
   time.

   I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding
   (or, controlling) the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not
   blow on the land, or on the sea, or upon any tree]    The number four
   marks this vision as pertaining to the earth. The winds are so
   designated in Jer. xlix. 36. Dan. vii. 2; viii. 8; xi. 4, the four
   comprising all winds; or simply marking the four points of the compass.
   Stillness is the point to be emphasised here, as when we say "not a
   leaf moves:" it tells us that this sealing will take place before the
   opening events of the great Tribulation.

   2. And I saw another angel ascending [186] from the rising of the sun
   (i.e., the East) having the seal of the Living God: and he cried with a
   loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to injure the land
   and the sea: (3)saying, "Injure not the earth, or the sea, or the
   trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God upon their
   foreheads"]    This is, of course, preliminary to Matt. xxiv. 31. It
   precedes the Tribulation, as shown by the reason given for the sealing.
   But from Matt. xxiv. 31 we learn that after the Tribulation, Angels are
   commissioned to gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of
   heaven to the other." The two passages stand in the closest connection,
   and show that the "elect" in Matt. xxiv. 31 belong to Israel, and not
   to the church. They are upon the earth during the Tribulation and this
   seal or sealing, whatever it is, protects and preserves them unscathed.
   This sealing was evidently visible, as the locusts are directed in
   chap. ix. 4 to injure only those "who have not the seal of God in their
   foreheads." The Beast has this seal, with which he will seal his
   followers; and this is the Divine distinguishing mark which God sets
   upon His servants. Just as in the days of the Patriarchs He could
   protect them, saying "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no
   harm" (Psa. cv. 15): so here, with this elect Remnant. Those who have
   the mark of the Beast are idolators of the deepest die; but those who
   have the Divine mark, are sealed with "the seal of the Living God."
   This title here (as elsewhere) is always used with reference to idols
   and idolatry (see Deut. v. 26. Josh. iii. 10. Jer. x. 2-11. Dan. vi.
   26. 1 Thess. i. 9, 10). Then will Psa. xci. receive a new application
   of a very remarkable kind (see verses 5, 7, 8). In Ezek. ix. 3, 4 we
   have a similar sealing by which a devoted remnant have their lot in the
   corrupt city of Jerusalem. They may be part of this very number in Rev.
   vii. In Ex. xii. 7 the houses of the Israelites were marked for a
   similar purpose. In Rev. ii. 17 this mark is promised, and the promise
   is exhausted in xxii. 4.

   The Romans marked their soldiers in the hand; and their slaves in the
   forehead. Herodotus (ii. 113) speaks of the worshippers of a certain
   god as having his name branded upon them. In like manner the
   worshippers of the Beast are branded (xiii. 16-18; xiv. 9, 11; xvi. 2;
   xix. 20; xx. 4); and these Divinely sealed ones are marked as the
   worshippers of the true God.

   4. And I heard the number of the sealed: an hundred and forty four
   thousand sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel]    Alford
   says of this number, "No one that I am aware of has taken it
   literally!" Very likely: but we are thankful to be an exception to the
   rule, and to believe what God says. There is such a thing as Figures of
   Speech, but, we ask, what Figure is used here? What is its name? The
   truth is that there is here no Figure whatever; but it is the simple
   statement of fact: a definite number in contrast with the indefinite
   number in this very chapter (verse 9). If the total number is not
   exact, then all the items which go to make it up are indefinite also.
   If this number is symbolical, then what number in the Book may we take
   as literal? None, according to this principle of interpretation, which
   substitutes man's own vain imaginations for God's revelation. Again, we
   repeat, we prefer to believe God. And, believing Him, we conclude that
   as He had reserved 7,000 in the days of Ahab (1 Kings xix. 18. Rom. xi.
   4), so He will reserve 144,000 in the Great Tribulation.

   We have here, therefore, the nucleus of the new nations referred to by
   Christ in Matt. xxi. 43. We have also what will be the fulfilment of
   the prophecy of Daniel xii. 1: "At that time shall Michael (the other
   angel) stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of
   thy people (Israel): and there shall be a time of trouble, such as
   never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that
   time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found
   written in the book." Here, in Rev. vii, we have the sealing of those
   written names, which shall be "delivered." (Compare Joel ii. 28-32).
   What this seal was we learn from chap. xiv. 1.

   5. Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed; Of the tribe of
   Reuben, twelve thousand; [187] Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;
   [188] (6) Of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand; [189] Of the tribe of
   Nepthalim, twelve thousand; [190] Of the tribe of Manasses, twelve
   thousand; [191] (7) Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; [192] Of
   the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; [193] Of the tribe of Issachar,
   twelve thousand; [194] (8) Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand;
   [195] Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; [196] Of the tribe of
   Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed]    In this enumeration we have to
   note the omission of the Tribes of Dan and Ephraim: Levi and Joseph
   being inserted to take their place. The reason for this seems to be
   quite clear. In Deut. xxix. 18-21, we read that the "man or woman or
   family or tribe" who should introduce idolatry into Israel, "all the
   curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord
   shall blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord shall separate
   him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the
   curses of the covenant that are written in this law." And when it
   should be asked, "Wherefore hath the Lord done this?... then men shall
   say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their
   fathers... for they went and served other gods and worshipped them,
   gods whom they knew not" (verses 24-26).

   Now it was one of the tribe of Dan who first came under this curse. See
   Lev. xxiv. 10-16.

   It is remarkable that these two tribes, Dan and Ephraim, participated
   in introducing idolatry later on (Judges xviii. 2, 30, 31). And
   afterward it was Jeroboam devised of the golden calves and set them up
   in the tribe of Dan (1 Kings xi. 26; xii. 28-30. See also Hos. iv. 17).

   True, we find Dan and Ephraim restored in the future distribution of
   the Land (Ezek. xlviii.), for "the gifts and calling of God, are
   without repentance (or change of mind)" (Rom. xi. 29). But that is a
   different matter, and has to do with earthly inheritance. Here it has
   to do with heavenly preservation. The omission in Rev. vii. is to show
   that these two tribes remain unprotected by the pledge of security
   given by this sealing. There will, of course, be thousands, besides
   these, of each of the other tribes on earth; the difference will be in
   their not being sealed, and in their not being protected against the
   onslaught of the Beast. That they are on the earth is clear from Jer.
   iv. 5-31 (see verse 15); viii. 13-17 (see verse 16). Amos viii. 11-14.

   We have a remarkable illustration of this in Num. xxxi., when in order
   to execute judgment on the Midianites 1,000 from each tribe were taken.
   And as the 144,000 here survive through all the great Tribulation, so
   it was with the 12,000 sent against the Midianites; for when their
   number was taken at the close, the officers came to Moses and said "Thy
   servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our
   charge, and there lacketh not one man of us" (verses 48, 49).

   Even so will it be true of these 144,000, when they stand afterwards on
   Mount Zion (xiv. 1-5).

                         The Second Vision "in Heaven"

   H^2, chaps. vii. 9-- 6.

   The Great Multitude and the Seventh Seal.


   We now come to the second Vision "in Heaven." It contains a yet further
   answer to the question of vi. 17: "Who shall be able to stand" in the
   judgment? while it commences the second pair of Visions: viz., the
   opening of the seventh Seal "in heaven," and the consequent sounding of
   the six Trumpets "on earth."

   The Structure of the Vision, as a whole, is as follows:--

   H^2. vii. 9-- 6.  The Second Vision in Heaven.
   The Great Multitude and the Seventh Seal.

   H^2 | A | vii. 9-12.  The Heavenly Voices and utterances.
                   B | 13, 14.  The Great Multitude.  Whence they came.
                   B | 15-17.  The Great Multitude.  Where they are.
           A | vii. 1-6.  The Heavenly Silence and Activities (Seventh
   Seal).


   Each of these four larger members may be expanded; and we give the
   expansions in order, with translation, as before.

   A |     a | 9.  The great multitude.
                   b | 10.  Their utterance.  "Salvation to our God."
            a | 11, 12-.  All the angels.
                   b | -12.  Their utterance.  "Blessing and
   Glory."


   TRANSLATION OF "a", vii. 9.

   The Great Multitude.

   vii. 9. After these things]     the expression marks a separation from
   what has gone before, and introduces the second distinct Vision "in
   heaven."

   I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which no one was able to number, out
   of every nation, and of all tribes and peoples, and tongues (Gen. x. 5,
   20, 31. Dan. iii. 4, 5; iv. 1; vi. 25), standing before the throne, and
   before the Lamb, arrayed with white robes, and palm branches in their
   hands;]     The definite number of Israelites (vii. 1-8) stands in
   marked contrast to this innumerable company of Gentiles. We say
   Gentiles, because this Vision carries us on to the end, as the
   preceding Vision of the sealing carried us back to the beginning. We
   are, here, beyond Matt. xxiv., and even xxv. Two distinct companies are
   named, first "Jews," then "Gentiles." Thus both are marked off from
   "the church of God," which is now composed of both Jews and Gentiles.
   The twelve tribes of vii. 4-8 are distinct from people out of "all
   tribes." That they are distinct from "the church of God" is further
   shown, in that they are "standing" in the position of servants (and not
   seated); and are "before the throne" (not upon it). True, they share
   the same salvation, and by the same precious merits of the blood of the
   Lamb. But as "star differeth from star in glory" (1 Cor. xv. 41), so do
   these differ in their position, dignity, and honour. They are saved,
   but for what? and for which one of the "many mansions"? They are seen
   "in heaven," but not until after the Great Tribulation through which
   and out of which they will have been brought.

   Not only will this elect remnant of Israel survive "through" the
   Tribulation, but a countless multitude from all the Gentile nations
   will be saved "out" of it.

   Constantly do we find Gentile blessing consequent upon Israel's
   blessing. First, God deals with Israel, and then with mankind in
   general. This stated in many passages: e.g., Ps. lxvii. 1:

   "God be merciful to us, and bless us;
   And cause his face to shine upon us:
   That thy way may be known upon earth,
   Thy saving health among all nations."

   The same fact is stated in verse 7:
   "God shall bless us.
   And all the ends of the earth shall fear him."

   Again in Ps. xcviii. 3, we read:
   He hath remembered his mercy,
   And his truth toward the house of Israel:
   All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God."

   So in Isa. xlix. 6, Jehovah says to Messiah:
   "It is a light thing
   That thou shouldest be my servant,
   To raise up the tribes of Jacob,
   And to restore the preserved of Israel;
   I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,
   That thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.

   So Isa. lii. 9, 10:
   "Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem.
   For the Lord hath comforted his people.
   He hath redeemed Jerusalem.
   The Lord hath made bare his holy arm
   In the eyes of all the nations,
   And all the ends of the earth shall see
   The salvation of our God."

   The palm-branches speak not merely of victory, as with the heathen, but
   of the Feast of Tabernacles (see Lev. xxiii. 39-43). It was not a feast
   for the wilderness, but for the time "when ye be come into the Land."
   (Lev. xxiii. 10). And yet it was never kept in the Land by all Israel.
   Not until the return from Babylon was it kept (See Neh. viii. 16, 17).
   Then "all the people shouted with a great shout" (Ezra iii. 11, 12. 2
   Chron. xx. 19. So here, in like manner it will be again kept.


   b., vii. 10. Their utterance.

   10. And they cry [197] with a loud voice, saying
   "Salvation to our God
   That sitteth upon the Throne,
   And to the Lamb."

   They ascribe their salvation and their deliverance from the Tribulation
   which they had passed through, to God. A paraphrase would be, "Praise
   for our salvation be to our God," etc. The church calls God "my Father"
   ("Abba," Rom. viii. 15), but the Sealing Angel speaks of Him as "our
   God" (ch. vii. 3). The assembled angels say "our God" (ch. vii. 12),
   and this great multitude say "our God" (ch. vii. 10).


   a., vii. 11, 12-, All the angels, etc., and b., Their utterance.

   vii. 11. And all the angels were standing [198] around the throne, and
   around the Elders and the four Zoa, and they fell before the throne on
   their faces, and worshipped God, (12) saying,
                   "Amen!
       Blessing, and glory, and wisdom,
       and thanksgiving, and honour, and
       power, and might, be unto our
       God, for ever and ever.
                   Amen!"

   Such is the sevenfold ascription of the heavenly host standing around
   the throne, the elders and the Zoa. It is similar to that in chap. v.
   12, but the order of the words is different, and thanksgiving is here
   put instead of "riches." There the ascription was to the Lamb. Here it
   is to "our God."

   We next have the explanation of the Vision; and the Question which one
   of the Elders put to John shows that we should have a like spirit of
   holy enquiry. It is not mere abstract wonder that God looks for in us
   now, but a reverential interest in what He has revealed in the Visions
   of this book.

   The following is the Structure of B., chap. vii. 13, 14:
   B. vii. 13, 14.  The Great Multitude:  Whence they came.

   B |     c | vii. 13-.  The Elder.

   TRANSLATION of B, vii. 13, 14.

   vii. 13. And one of the Elders answered saying (i.e., by the Figure,
   Idiom "asked me, saying") unto me,
               "These who are arrayed in white
               robes, Who are they? and Whence came they?
   (14) and I said, my [199] lord, thou knowest. And he said to me,
               "These are they who come out of the Great Tribulation, and
   they
               washed their robes, and made them white through the blood
   of the Lamb]
   Not "in the blood"; nothing under the Law was ever washed "in blood,"
   nothing can be made white "washed in" blood. It is through a forced
   literal meaning of the preposition (...) (en) which has led to this
   false notion. This preposition constantly means by, or through: and is
   translated "by" 142 times and "through" 37 times. (See Matt. ix. 34; v.
   34, 35. Gal. iii. 11. 2 Tim. ii. 10). In this very book (v. 9) it is
   rendered "by." So here and in i. 5 this must be the meaning. This is
   the standing of "works"; and not our standing in "grace," as in the
   present dispensation. We are "washed, justified, and sanctified in the
   name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor. vi. 11).
   These have washed their own robes, and made them white. This is
   followed by the consequence:--


   B. vii. 15-17.  The great multitude:  Where they are.

   B |     h |     i | 15-.  The Multitude. Position before the throne
                           j | -15.  God upon the throne.
           h |     i | 16.  The multitude.  Their Blessing.
                           j | 17.  God.  The Lamb the Blesser.

   15. "For this cause are they before the throne of God, and serve him
   day and night in his temple: and he who sitteth upon the throne shall
   spread his tabernacle over them.]     This is exactly what we read in
   Isa. iv. 5, 6.
   "And the Lord will create
   Upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion,
   And upon her assemblies,
   A cloud and smoke by day,
   And the shining of a flaming fire by night;
   For above all the glory shall be a covering (marg., Heb. (...)
   (chuppah), the marriage canopy, for the marriage of the Lamb will have
   come)
   And there shall be a tabernacle
   For a shadow in the day time from the heat
   And a place of refuge, and for a covert
   From storm and from rain."

   They perform priestly service day and night, and fulfil the duties of
   "servants," for they "serve before the throne." Other Old Testament
   passages referred to here are Lev. xxvi. 11. Ezek. xxxvii. 27.

   And then, alluding to the privations and trials they have undergone, we
   have further earthly blessings:--

   h. vii. 16, 17.  The Blessing and the Blesser.

   The Blessing:  Negative
   h |     k | 16-.  No hunger.
                   l | -16-.  No thirst.
                       m | -16.  No suffering.

           The Blesser:  Positive
   h|       k | 17-.  Hunger satisfied.
                   l | -17-.  Thirst assuaged.
                       m | -17.  Sorrow banished.


   16. "They shall not hunger any more, nor yet thirst any more; neither
   shall the sun in any wise fall upon them; no, nor any burning heat.
   (17) Because the Lamb that is in the midst of the Throne shall tend
   them (as a shepherd), and shall lead them unto the fountains of the
   waters of life: [200] and God shall wipe away every tear from their
   eyes"]     Thus ends the Elder's description of the great multitude and
   their ultimate blessings. The blessings of the Church are heavenly. We
   have the same blessing prophesied in Isa. xlix. 8-10; xxv. 8; and lxv.
   19. Jer. xxxi. 16. Thus are Israel's blessings extended to Gentiles.
   The fulfilment is seen in Rev. xxi. 3, 4; xxii. i. and Ezek. xlvii.

   The Seventh Seal (viii. 1-6).

   From the Structure of this Second Vision "in Heaven" we saw that this
   last great member A (viii. 1-6) is set in contrast and corresponds with
   A (vii. 9-12), the Heavenly voices and utterances.

   We have shown that the six Seals cover not only the whole period of the
   Great Tribulation, but that the sixth bring us right up to the great
   day of wrath; co-terminous, apparently, with chap. xi. 17, 18 (the
   seventh Trumpet), and chap. xx. (the final Judgment).

   But that, whereas the seventh Trumpet expands into the seven Vials --
   which are consecutive -- the sixth Seal is followed by silence in
   heaven, as though to break off all continuity, and to show us that we
   have to go back and learn how the details of the judgments of the Seals
   are to be filled in.

   The following is the Structure of viii. 1-6, describing the close of
   this second Vision "in Heaven":

   A. viii. 1-6.  The Heavenly Silence and Activities.
   (The Seventh Seal.)

   A |     n |     p |     1.  Silence in heaven.
                           q | 2.  The 7 angels and the 7 Trumpets.
                                   o |     r | 3.  Another angel with
   censer and prayers.
                                                   s | 4.  Result.  Smoke
   ascended up to heaven.
                                   o |     r | 5-.  The angel with censer
   and fire.
                                                   s | -5-.  Result.  Fire
   descended to the earth.

   A |      n |     p | -5.  Sounds on the earth.
                           q | 6.  The 7 angels and the 7 Trumpets.

   The breaking of the seventh Seal, instead of producing one single
   result, as the other six had done is closed by this "silence," which
   seemed to John to last half an hour; after which, John is shown how the
   prayers of the saints under the fifth Seal are presented (verses 3, 4),
   and answered (verse 5), by the commencement of a series of judgments
   ushered in by the sounding of seven Trumpets. But we will first give
   the translation of viii. 1-6.

   viii. 1. And when he opened the seventh seal, there was (i.e., became,
   came on, or followed) silence in heaven about half an hour.]     At the
   sounding of the seventh Trumpet there are "great voices in heaven" (xi.
   5). And at the pouring out of the seventh Vial, a great voice came out
   of the throne (xvi. 17).

   But this "silence" means more than that. It marks very solemnly the
   pause between the prayer and the answer, which shall turn the prayer
   into praise. On earth, the cry of the saints has been incessant. They
   "cry day and night." In heaven the cry is now about to be answered, and
   there is a solemn pause -- the silence of expectation.

   The Heb. (...) (dumeyyah) silence (fem. adj.), which occurs four times,
   exactly expresses the position.

   (1)   "O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not;
           And in the night season, there is no silence to me.
           But thou art holy,
           O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel" (Psa. xxii. 2, 3
   (3, 4).
   (2)   "I was dumb with silence (Psa. xxxix. 2 (3)).
   (3)   "Truly my soul is silence toward God:
           From him cometh my salvation" (Psa. lxii. 1 (2)).
   (4)   "There shall be silence before thee,
           And praise, O God, in Zion.
           O thou that hearest prayer,
           Unto thee shall all flesh come" (Psa. lxv. 1 (2) RV. marg.).

   In all these four passages the word denotes a period of waiting between
   the offering of the prayer, and the giving of the answer which shall
   call forth praise. The adverb in Lam. iii. 26 exactly expresses it: "It
   is good when one doth wait even in silence for the salvation of
   Jehovah."

   That goodness is here seen, for the prayers offered on earth are,
   during this period of silence, formally presented before God, and the
   answer is formally announced in the preparation of the seven angels to
   sound their Trumpets and declare war against Satan and all his hosts.
   This is what is now seen by John.

   2. and I saw the seven angels]      i.e., at the expiration of the
   half-hour. Not merely seven angels, but THE seven, because well known,
   and before referred to as "the seven spirits which are before the
   throne" (i. 4; iii. 1; iv. 5; v. 6), for "he maketh his angels spirits"
   (Heb. i. 7).

   At the breaking of the seventh Seal there is silence. This shows that
   here we have a pause with a view of a return, to fill up details. While
   in the other two (the Trumpets and Vials) we have continuous and
   consecutive and consequent action arising from the seventh Trumpet.

   who stand in the presence of God;]      In chap. iv. 5, they are the
   called THE seven spirits of God (So. iii. 1) for it is said of the
   angels: He "maketh His angels spirits" (Heb. i. 14). The word (...)
   (pneumata) spirits, is used of any spiritual being. In chap. v. 6 also
   we again read of "THE seven spirits sent forth into all the earth."

   There seems to be no doubt but that all these passages relate to the
   same seven "Presence-Angels."

   In Dan. iv. 13 (10), 17 (14), 23 (20), they are called (...) (irin)
   watchers (Greek, (...) (egregoroi), lxx. Lam. iv. 14). This term is
   from Ps. ciii. 20, i.e., those who watch and wait for the Divine
   commands. That GABRIEL is one of these is clear from Luke i. 19.
   MICHAEL may be another.

   and there was given unto them seven trumpets.]     By whom they were
   given is not stated. But they were given by direction from the Throne;
   the action of which is now renewed, though it is changed. The Lamb
   opened the Seals, but Angels sound the Trumpets. The Seals were opened
   in secret; the Trumpets publicly proclaim war. (See Num. x. 9. Judges
   vi. 34; iii. 27; vii. 8, 16, 18. 1 Sam. xiii. 3. Jer. iv. 5. Job xxxix.
   25. Rev. xiv. 14). They notify also the presence of the great and
   terrible day of the Lord. See Zeph. i. 14-16.

   3. And another angel came and took his stand at the altar, having a
   golden censer;]     We are not told who this other angel was, and
   therefore it is simple speculation to assert, as many do, that he was
   the Lord Jesus Himself. The golden censer belonged to the Holy Place
   (Heb. ix. 4), and it was the golden altar on which the incense was
   offered.

   And there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with
   the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar that was before the
   throne. (4) And the smoke of the incense went up before God, with the
   prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel.]     We have here
   a Vision of events in Heaven, from which we learn that Heaven is a
   place of great and grand realities; the dwelling-place of God, in which
   Heavenly worship is carried on. The Tabernacle on earth and its
   worship; and afterward the Temple with its ordinances, were only copies
   of the realities in heaven; "figures of the true," and "patterns of
   things in the heavens." "Moses was admonished of God when he was about
   to make the Tabernacle: for, see, saith he, that thou make all things
   according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount" (Heb. viii. 5;
   ix. 23, 24). In like manner was David admonished, when he received the
   plan and pattern of the Temple "in writing" from God (1 Chron. xxviii.
   11-13, 19).

   The prayers of the martyred saints were over, but the cry of their
   blood from the ground is voiced in words (vi. 10). These prayers are
   the living saints, the people of the book; the 144,000, and the great
   multitude before they are taken out of the great Tribulation, who "cry
   day and night unto Him" (Luke xviii. 7). We have specimens of these
   prayers, given (proleptically) in the Psalms:
           "Give them according to their deeds,
           And according to the wickedness of their endeavours:
           Give them after the work of their hands;
           Render to them their desert" (Psa. xxviii. 4).

           "Do unto them as unto the Midianites;
           As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kishon" (Ps.
   lxxxiii. 9).

   And the very Psalm which likens prayer to incense, also contains
   similar prayers (Ps. cxli. 1, 2, 7, 10).
           "Lord, I cry unto thee:
           Make hast unto me:
           Give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
           Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense;
           And the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice...
           Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth,
           As when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth...
           Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
           Whilst that I withal escape (marg. Heb. pass over).

   The Golden altar "is before the throne." So it was in the earthly copy
   of the heavenly pattern. It was "before the vail that is by the ark of
   the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony" (Ex.
   xxx. 6; xl. 5, 26).

   5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the
   altar (Lev. xvi. 12), and he cast the fire unto the earth: and there
   were thunderings, and voices, and lightnings, [201] and an earthquake.]
   We have a similar scene in Ezek. x. 2, &c., where the fire is taken
   from between the cherubim under the throne, and scattered over the city
   of Jerusalem in token of its destruction. So here: that on which the
   fire falls is to be consumed and destroyed. This is the answer to the
   prayers which had been so solemnly offered. In other places "fire" is
   mentioned as one of the judgments which He will send on the earth. (see
   Ezek. xxxix. 6; xxxviii. 22. Hos. viii. 14. Amos i. 4, 7, 10, 12; ii.
   5). Compare Deut. xxxii. 22.

   This very scene is prophesied in similar words in Ps. xviii. 4, 6-8:
           "The floods of ungodly (marg., Belial) men made me afraid...
           In my distress I called upon the Lord,
           And cried unto my God:
           He heard my voice out of his Temple,
           And my cry came before him, even into his ears.
           Then the earth shook and trembled;
           The foundations also of the hills moved
           And were shaken, because he was wroth,
           There went up a smoke out of (marg., by) his nostrils,
           And fire out of his mouth devoured:
           Coals were kindled by it."

   The fulfilment of the next verse, which speaks of this actual descent,
   is deferred here by the description of other events which are also to
   take place.

   6. And the seven angels who had the seven Trumpets made themselves
   ready that they might sound them.]     The prohibition of vii. 1 is now
   about to be removed. Twice the sevenfold enunciation is given, and the
   reproach of Ps. lxxix. 11, 12 is about to be rewarded "sevenfold," in
   answer to the prayers which had been offered.

   This heavenly vision is a vision showing what will one day literally
   take place. If they are Symbols, they are symbols of solemn realities.
   If they are Figures, they are figures, not of speech, but of facts.
   Just as the judgments of God at the time of the Exodus were real and
   literal; and the announcements of them were literally fulfilled, so
   will these be. For they are exactly what is foretold. "According to the
   days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I show him marvellous
   things" (Mic. vii. 15).

   Indeed, we are distinctly told that the physical marvels of that day
   shall be "like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of
   the land of Egypt" (Is. xi. 15, 16).

   We are even told in Jer. xxiii. 7, 8 that the coming judgments (for
   which preparation is now made, Rev. viii. 1-6) shall exceed those which
   God performed in Egypt, and the covenant of marvels we must once more
   quote as being conclusive on this point:

   "Behold I make a covenant: before all thy people I WILL DO MARVELS,
   such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all
   the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord: for it
   is a TERRIBLE THING that I will do with thee" (Ex. xxxiv. 10, and
   compare Deut. xxviii. 10).

                          The Second Vision "On Earth"

   E^2, THE FIRST SIX TRUMPETS (viii. 7 - xi. 14).


   A., The First Four Trumpets (viii. 7-12)

   Before we give the Structure of this section we must again call
   attention to the fact that the sixth Seal takes us on to the time of
   the end; and the seventh Seal takes us back and commences a new series
   of judgments initiated by the seven Trumpets and followed by the seven
   Vials. So that the whole of the rest of the Apocalypse comes under the
   seventh Seal. Whereas the seventh Trumpet issues in and contains the
   seven Vials.

   First of all we have (as we have seen) the six Seals (chaps. vi., vii.)

   Then the seventh Seal expands into and contains both the seven Trumpets
   (viii. 7 - xi. 14) and the seven Vials (xvi. 1 - xviii. 24).

   Finally, the seventh Trumpet expands into and contains the seven Vials
   (xvi. 1 - xviii. 24).

   Thus the seventh Seal embraces the whole of the great Judgment period
   of the Trumpets and Vials (from viii. 7 - xviii. 24) and is immediately
   followed by the Apocalypse of the Son of Man in power and great glory.

   A careful study of the following Presentation will explain our meaning;
   and set forth the order of the general contents of these judgment
   Visions, viii. 1 - xviii. 24:


   The Seventh Seal, viii. 1--xviii. 24.

   The
   Seventh Seal
   consisting of
   The Seven Trumpets
   and the Seven Vials


   viii. 7.  The 1st Trumpet.  Fire mingled with blood.  Third part of
   Trees and grass burnt up.

   viii. 8, 9.  The 2nd Trumpet.  Burning mountain cast into sea.  Third
   of sea becomes blood.

   viii. 10, 11.  The 3rd Trumpet.  Burning star falls on third part of
   Rivers ("Wormwood").

   viii. 12, 13.  The 4th Trumpet.  Third part of Sun smitten.  Moon and
   stars darkened.

   ix. 1-12.  The 5th Trumpet. (The First WOE).  Pit opened.  Locusts.

   ix. 13--xi. 14.  The 6th Trumpet. (The Second WOE).  The 4 Euphratean
   Angels loosed.  Horsemen.

   xi. 15.

   The Seventh Trumpet (x. 7)

   The 3rd WOE (Rev. xi. 14).
   Consisting of the Seven Vials.


   xvi. 1, 2.  Vial I.  (The Third WOE).  On the earth.  Sores on
   Worshippers of Beast.

   xvi. 3.  Vial II.  On the Sea.  Sea became blood.

   xvi. 4-7.  Vial III.  On the Rivers.  Rivers became blood.

   xvi. 8-9.  Vial IV.  On the Sun.  men scorched with fire.

   xvi. 10, 11.  Vial V.  On the Throne of the Beast.  Kingdom full of
   darkness.

   xvi. 12-16.  Vial VI.  On the River Euphrates.  Euphrates dried up.  3
   spirits like Frogs.  Armageddon.

   xvi. 17--xviii. 24.  Vial VII.  "It is done."  The judgment of Great
   Babylon


   The whole of this great judgment period, covered by the Trumpets and
   Vials, is given in two pairs of alternate Visions of events "in Heaven"
   and "on Earth."

   The 2nd Vision "in Heaven" (viii. 1-6) consists of the opening of the
   seventh Seal.
   The 2nd Vision "on Earth" (viii. 7- xi. 14) consists of the effects of
   this opening (the first six Trumpets).

   The 3rd Vision "in Heaven" (xi. 15-19-) consists of the Sounding of the
   seventh Trumpet.
   The 3rd Vision "on Earth" (xi. -19) consists of the effects of this
   sounding.

   We are then (in chap. xii.) taken back to a time prior to chap. iv.;
   while the sequence of the Trumpet and Vial judgments is broken in order
   to admit of this parenthetical break.

   The Trumpet and Vial judgments are continuous once they begin. It is
   only the description of them (not the course of them) which is
   interrupted, in order to allow of the necessary information being given
   which shows the necessity for them.

   This digression commences at chap. xii. 1 and is carried on to xv. 8.
   Then the description of the Vial Judgments is taken up and continued,
   giving the results "on Earth" of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet;
   an epitome of which had been given in a few words in xi. -19. These
   Vial Judgments are then continuous from xvi. 1 - xviii. 24, which ends
   their mission, accomplishes their object, and issues in the Revelation
   of Christ from Heaven in power and great glory (chap. xix.).

   But we must return now to the second Vision "on Earth," runs from viii.
   7 - xi. 14.


   E^2. viii. 7--xi. 14.  The Second Vision "On Earth."
   The First Six Trumpets

   E^2 | A | B | a | viii. 7-.  The FIRST Trumpet.
   ^                        b | viii. -7-.  The Earth smitten (Hail and

   smitten (Burning mountain, etc.)
                                                   f | viii. -8.  Third
   part of sea, blood.
                                                       g | viii. 9.  Death
   of living creatures in sea.
                                   C | d | viii. 10-.  The THIRD Trumpet.
                                               e | viii. -10, 11-.  The

   part of waters wormwood.
                                                       g | viii. -11.
   Death of men.
                B | a | viii. 12-.  The FOURTH Trumpet.
                           b | viii. -12-.  The Heavens smitten (Sun,
   Moon, and Stars).
                               c | viii. -12.  Third part darkened.
         A | D | viii. 13.  Three woes yet to come.
                   E | h | ix. 1-11.  The FIFTH Trumpet.  (The First WOE).
                           i | ix. 12.  The termination of First Woe ("The
   first woe is past.")
                   E | h | ix. 13--xi. 13.  The SIXTH Trumpet.  (The
   Second WOE).
                           i | xi. 14-.  The termination of Second Woe
   ("The second woe is past.")
               D | xi. -14.  "The third woe cometh quickly."

   Here we have the whole of the six Trumpets. The six refer to the earth;
   the seventh consists of the third Vision "in heaven." So with the
   Seals: six referred to the earth, and the seventh was opened "in
   heaven." It is the same with the seven Trumpets; six Trumpets refer to
   the earth, the seventh refers to heaven. Moreover, they are divided
   into four and three: the four (A. viii. 7-12) being grouped together,
   and the last three (A. viii. 13-xi. 14, etc.) being the three "Woe"
   Trumpets.

   The first four Trumpets and their results are recorded with brevity;
   while the last three are set forth in more detail. The four occupy only
   seven verses; the last three occupy some fifty verses.

   The first of the four affects the earth; the fourth affects the
   heavens; while the second and third affect the waters of the earth.
   Thus all is recorded in perfect order.


   THE FIRST TRUMPET (viii. 7).

   viii. 7. And the first [202] sounded his trumpet,]     The verb (...)
   (salpizo) means to sound a trumpet; the noun (...) (salpingx) being
   included in the verb.

   and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast
   upon the earth: and the third of the earth was burned up, [203] and the
   third of the trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned
   up]     In the plagues of Egypt, to which these judgments were to be
   like, the seventh plague was "hail, and fire mingled with the hail"
   (Ex. ix. 22-28), and plants of the earth were smitten (verses 31, 32).
   Here blood was mingled with the fire and hail. We are aware that a
   majority of interpreters maintain that the results of this first
   Trumpet are not literal. They seem as anxious to get rid of the
   miraculous and the supernatural from Interpretation, as the
   Rationalists are to eliminate it from Inspiration. But why, unless the
   plagues of Egypt also were not literal plagues, we cannot understand.
   Again we ask, Why should not these be literal judgments which are to
   come on the earth? What is the difficulty? God has said concerning the
   events of the day of the Lord, "I will show wonders in heaven above and
   signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire" (Joel ii. 30). How He will
   do this we are here told.

   To explain this away is to manifest a want of faith in the power of
   God, and in the Word of God. Such things have taken place on earth. Why
   should they not take place again?

   Cicero [204] tells us that the word was brought to the Roman Senate, on
   one occasion, that it had rained blood, and that the river Atratus had
   flowed with blood.

   On August 17, 1819, Dr. Seiss tells us that "Captain Ross saw the
   mountains at Baffin's Bay covered for eight miles with blood-red snow
   many feet in depth." Also that Saussare found it on Mount St. Bernard,
   in 1778; that Ramond found it on the Pyrenes; and Summerfield in
   Norway.

   Why may it not be seen again?

   The historical interpreters differ so much among themselves that we may
   well ask, Which one of them are we to believe? It is this very
   diversity which has caused so many earnest students to put the
   Apocalypse aside in despair. Our object in writing is that they may
   take up the book again with hope; asking them only to believe God. It
   will be better to err in such simplicity of faith in the Word of God,
   than to adopt the most plausible scheme based upon the opinion of man;
   and which differs not only from God, but from every other human
   interpretation.

   For example, Elliott says that this first Trumpet denotes the wars of
   Alaric the Goth and Rhadagaisus the Vandal against the Western Roman
   Empire. We should never have guessed this ourselves. There is nothing
   about this or even like it in this Scripture. John saw one result, Mr.
   Elliott gives two. John saw the blood-red rain of hail and fire from
   heaven; this gives human blood on earth!

   One says "trees" mean princes and great men; and "grass" means men's
   power and glory (Wordsworth).

   J.N. Darby says "that which is elevated, eminent, lofty is intended by
   the trees; the young, feeble and aged are meant by the green grass."

   Wetstein says "Trees mean fortified cities; grass, unwalled villages."

   Others say "by trees are signified apostles and great doctors; by
   grass, common Christians" (Paralus).

   Alford holds that "it appears rather to indicate a general characters
   of the judgments, than to require any special interpretation in each
   particular case."

   To all this we have one simple remark to make -- We prefer to believe
   God's own special interpretation of His own judgments, in the plain
   literal sense of the words.


   THE SECOND TRUMPET (viii. 8, 9).

   viii. 8. And the second angel sounded his trumpet, and as it were a
   great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third
   of the sea became blood; (9) and there died the third of the creatures
   which were in the sea, which had life; and the third of the ships were
   destroyed.]     It does not say it was a mountain, but that it was like
   one. This shows us what is not to be taken literally, as well as what
   is. It was something which resembled a mountain. John does not say he
   saw a volcano (as some assert). What John saw was a fiery mass like a
   mountain cast into the sea, and turning it into blood. "This cannot be
   literal" exclaim the interpreters. But again we ask, Why not? In one of
   the plagues of Egypt it is written that Moses "lifted up his rod, and
   smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and
   in the sight of his servants, and all the waters that were in the river
   were turned to blood" (Ex. viii. 20). In Ps. cv. 29 it is written, "He
   turned their waters into blood"; so Ps. lxxviii. 44. The poorest and
   humblest reader can understand this. It does not require education in
   order to believe God. All it needs is a spiritual understanding, and a
   childlike mind. (1 John v. 20 and 1 Cor. ii. 14.) It does not require
   wide reading to understand God. It requires faith.

   To follow what man says it requires only credulity. Which are we to
   believe of the following interpretations?

   One interpretation asks us to believe that
       The fiery mountain means Satan.
       The sea means the nations.
       The dying of the fish denotes the persecution and slaughter of
   Christians.
       The wreck of the ships denotes the extinction of congregations.

   (2). Another system (E.B. Elliott's) tells us that
       The mountain was Genseric with his Vandals, forced by the Huns from
   their native seat.
       The sea was their plunging through France and Spain into Africa,
   settling themselves in the conquered territory.
       The destruction of fish, etc., was their depredations on the
   neighboring islands and shores of the Mediterranean.

   (3) A third system tells us that
       The sea is the church with its baptismal waters.
       The mountain is some great heresy.
       The blood is the corruption by deadly error.
       The destruction of fish is the destruction of souls.
       The wreck of ships is the overturning of churches.

   (4) Another system is that
       The sea is the sea of Galilee, put for Palestine.
       The mountain is Vespasian.
       The fishes are the Jews.
       The ships are the cities of Palestine.

   (5) A fifth scheme is that
       The sea is pure doctrine.
       The mountain is prelacy.
       The fire Episcopal ambition.
       The blood-red waters means the introduction of false doctrine.
       The fishes are Ecclesiastics, monks.
       The ships the bearers of the Gospel.

   (6) A sixth system is that
       The mountain is Rome.
       Its burning the burning of Rome by Alaric.
       The wreck of its ships is the sack of Rome.

   (7) William Kelly would have us believe him. He says

   "The second blow supposes a great change: it falls on the sea, and so
   refers not to that sphere which is under special and settled
   government, but to that which is, or will then be, in a state of
   confusion and anarchy." And again "the mountain burning with fire,
   represents a system of power, itself under the judgment of God and the
   occasion of judgment to others" (Apoc., p. 141).

   Again we ask, Is it not better to believe God? Is it not easier to
   understand what He says?

   It is perfectly clear that all the above systems cannot be right. Which
   of them, then, are we to accept? Why is there this universal effort to
   have us believe that God always means something different from what He
   says? Whence comes this spirit? Dr. Seiss well asks, "What do we want
   with Vespasian and Alaric and Rhadagaisus, Attila, Genseric, Romans,
   Goths, Vandals, Arians, Prelates, or the Devil," when God tells us that
   it was a fiery mass like a mountain cast into the sea? That God's
   coming judgments will affect the fishes and the ships we are distinctly
   told in Hosea iv. 1-3. Zeph. i. 3. Isa. ii. 16, &c.

   All Bible readers and commentators believe that waters were turned to
   blood in the plagues of Egypt. Why not believe that they will be so
   turned again? If God had said ink instead of blood, we would believe
   Him. All things are possible with Him.

   Indeed, it is quite recently that we were told that this had happened;
   or something like it. The Daily Express (London May 19, 1900) says:
   "Great consternation has been caused at Santa Cruz (Cal., U.S.A.,) by
   the sea turning suddenly black," and given an extract from the San
   Francisco Examiner, which says:

   "There are many theories as to the cause of this remarkable change. One
   man thinks it is due to the tides. Another says the turbid waters are
   the result of a submarine upheaval in the blue mud of the channel. A
   third believes the water is full of animalculae -- the whale food.

   "Still another states that a storm from the ocean has muddled the
   water, and talks wisely, too, of marine earthquakes and the like. They
   all agree that the whole bay was never before like the sea of ink it is
   at present."

   If, in our day, the sea can be turned black, Why cannot it be as easily
   turned red? And when it is, when these words of "the book of this
   prophecy" shall be fulfilled, men will doubtless speculate about the
   cause of it, just as they speculate about the sea at Santa Cruz: and
   remain just as ignorant as before, because "God is not in all their
   thoughts."

   In like manner, the cleaving in two of the Mount of Olives in Zech.
   xiv. 4 is regarded by most commentators as being quite beyond a literal
   interpretation: and yet, a few years ago, The Illustrated London News
   gave some interesting drawings of the scene of the great volcanic
   eruption in the North Island, New Zealand. It will be remembered that
   the outburst of volcanic energy began by the explosion of MOUNT
   TARAWERA, a mountain which had no crater upon it, and showed no signs
   of recent activity. TARAWERA was split in two by the sudden opening of
   a great chasm or line of craters four miles long, about 500 feet wide,
   and, in many places, 400 feet deep.

   What happened in that case may easily happen again; not that we
   require, or ought to require, any such aid to our faith; for we believe
   that God means exactly what He says, in this and in other prophecies.


   THE THIRD TRUMPET (viii. 10, 11).

   viii. 10. And the third angel sounded his trumpet, and there fell from
   heaven a great star, burning as it were a torch ((...) (lampas) a
   torch; not (...) (luchnos) a lamp), and it fell upon the third of the
   rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; (11) and the name of the star
   is called Wormwood ((...) (apsinthos) Absinthe): and the third of the
   waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they
   were made bitter]     That stars should fall from heaven is a subject
   of prophecy (vi. 13). Here is one special star, smaller, evidently,
   than the burning mountain. When we are distinctly told it was "like a
   torch" there is no occasion to introduce the idea of a comet (as Dr.
   Seiss does), or a meteor, or anything else. As a torch it was burning
   only at one end, and not burning all over as the mountain was. All this
   is quite clear as it stands. It requires no explanation if we believe
   what is written.

   On the other hand, the ideas of historical interpreters are in wild
   confusion and mutual opposition. As to the "Star," the interpretations
   include Mahomet, Simon Magus, Montanus, Arius, Cerinthus, Pelagius,
   among ecclesiastics. Those who hold it to be a military personage say
   it was some Jewish leader, as Eleazar, Josephus, etc. Others bring in
   poor Genseric again, or Attila, and a long series of wholesale
   murderers.

   But a few questions will dispose of them all: What was the heaven out
   of which they fell? What was their fall? How did they burn? How did
   they embitter the fountains and rivers and make them bitter like
   themselves? When were they called by the name "Wormwood?" or
   "Absinthe?"

   There is no reasonable answer to these questions. It is a very sad
   reflection to think that, with so many, these definite and particular
   revelations of the Holy Ghost may mean anything.

   We ourselves might add another interpretation; and however extravagant
   it might be, men would not mind. Some would probably receive it. But,
   we dare to commit the unpardonable sin of adopting a principle of
   interpretation which requires us to believe that these things "mean"
   exactly what God says, and are consequently looked on as "cranks" for
   so doing.

   And yet events somewhat similar have happened. In the Annual Register
   for 1823, p. 683, we read that, as the result of a volcanic explosion,
   showers of sand darkened the sky and "the sea water became thick, and
   river water assumed the colour of beer, and was so extremely bitter as
   to be unfit for use. This was in the Aleutian Islands, and it is quoted
   by Mr. Govett in his Apocalypse Expounded. Something like this was
   foretold as God's punishment of His People (Jer. ix. 13-15): "Behold I
   will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of
   gall to drink." So Jer. xxiii. 15. Lam. iii. 15. Jer. viii. 14; ix. 15.

   The result of one of the plagues of Egypt was that "the Egyptians could
   not drink of the water of the river" (Ex. vii. 18-24). That was real
   and literal. So will this be.


   THE FOURTH TRUMPET (viii. 12).

   viii. 12. And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and the third of
   the moon, and the third of the stars; in order that the third part of
   them might be darkened, and the day might not shine for a third of it,
   and the night in like manner]     "Signs in the sun and in the moon and
   in the stars" are what the Lord foretold as part of the wonders to be
   looked for. (Luke xxi. 25. So Matt. xxiv. 29 and Mark xiii. 24). Here,
   some of those signs are seen by John. Others are foretold in Isaiah,
   "Behold darkness and sorrow: and the light is darkened in the heavens
   thereof (Isaiah v. 30). "I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I
   will darken the earth in the clear day [205] (Amos viii. 9). Read Jer.
   iv. 23, 28. Ezek. xxxii. 7, 8. Joel ii. 10, 30, 31; iii. 15. Amos v.
   20. Zeph. i. 14-16.

   The interpretations of this, differ, as usual; and it seems hardly
   worth our time to name them. We read about the "imperial sun" and the
   "political day" and "political noon" and "political stars," whatever
   they may be. Is it any wonder that teachers and students are alike
   confused and bewildered? They first assume that it is past; and are
   then at their wits' end to find something or anything, however
   irrelevant, that can be forced into any connection with the word.

   Ask a little child what are the sun, moon and stars? and he will
   experience no difficulty. Neither shall we, if we, with childlike
   minds, believe what God says.


   D. and E., THE FIFTH TRUMPET (or First Woe) (viii. 13 - ix. 12).

   The fifth and sixth Trumpets are the first and second of the three
   "Woe" Trumpets. These three are introduced in a special manner, viz.,
   by an Eagle and its cry (viii. 13), which marks off the last three of
   the whole seven, from the first four.

   The Eagle and its cry separates the four from the three.

   viii. 13. And I looked, and I heard an (Greek, one, single, or
   solitary)eagle [206] flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice,
   "Woe, woe, woe, to those that dwell upon the earth by reason of the
   remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are about to
   sound!"] (ix. 1, 12, and xi. 14). We believe it to be what it says -- a
   veritable eagle. All the critical Greek texts, and all the ancient
   manuscripts read "eagle." Bengel, 150 years ago, said that the "most
   ancient authorities, widely separated from each other in age and clime,
   and in very great numbers, clearly vindicate the reading of (...)
   (aetou), eagle, from all suspicion of gloss." Eagles are often
   connected with judgments. (See Deut. xxviii. 49. 2 Sam. i. 23. Is. xl.
   31. Jer. iv. 13. Hos. viii. 1. Hab. i. 8). It was flying in mid-heaven,
   i.e., the meridian, or the highest point reached by the sun at noon.
   The word rendered "mid-heaven" occurs only here, and in xiv. 6 and xix.
   17. The fifth day saw the creation of birds which "fly above the earth
   in the open firmament of heaven" (Gen. i. 20); and it is an eagle that
   announces this fifth Trumpet.

   This eagle speaks. So did Balaam's ass. If God could "open the mouth"
   of the one, so He can of the other. Thus it is written, and thus we
   believe.

   The Structure of the member containing the description of this Trumpet
   is as follows:--

   h. ix. 1-11.  The Fifth Trumpet (1st WOE).

       h |     k | 1-.  The Star fallen to the earth.
                       l | -1, 2.  The Abyss.  (The key and the opening).
                       l | -2.  The Abyss.  (The result of the opening).
               k | 3-11.  The Locusts coming upon the earth.


   This structure shows that three things form the subject of this Fifth
   Trumpet: The fallen Star, The Pit of the Abyss, and The Locusts.

   ix. 1. And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star from
   heaven fallen (So RV. Not "fall" as in AV.) to earth: and there was
   given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.]    The star (or angel)
   had fallen from heaven before John saw it. (Compare Isa. xiv. 12. Luke
   x. 18).

   Angels are called stars in Job xxxviii. 7, and often in the Old
   Testament, the phrase "host of heaven" means the angels, as in 1 Kings
   xxii. 19. 2 Chron. xviii. 18. Ps. cxlviii. 2. Josh. v. 14. It sometimes
   means the literal stars, as in Is. xxiv. 4; xl. 26; xlv. 12. Jer.
   xxxiii. 22. That the word "star," here, is used for "angel" seems clear
   from the personal actions ascribed to it.

   "The pit of the abyss" appears to be the abode of demons. See Rev. xx.
   1-3. Luke viii. 28, 31.

   2. And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up smoke out of
   the abyss, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air
   were darkened by the smoke of the pit.]     We are not to confuse this
   pit with Hades, or Sheol, or Tartarus. It is called the Abyss, and is
   shown by the smoke to be a place of fire. (Compare xviii. 9, 18; xix.
   3; and Gen. xix. 24-28).

   In Jeremiah iv. 23-28, we read:

   "I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void:
   And the heavens, and they had no light.
   I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled,
   And all the hills moved lightly.
   I beheld, and lo, there was no man,
   And all the birds of the heavens were fled.
   I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,
   And all the cities thereof were broken down
   At the presence of the Lord,
   And by His fierce anger.
   For thus hath the Lord said,
   The whole land shall be desolate;
   Yet will I not make a full end.
   For this shall the earth mourn,
   And the heavens above be black:
   Because I have spoken it, I have purposed it,
   And will not repent, nor will I turn back from it."

   This refers, of course, to Judah and the Land. What John sees, refers
   to the earth in general. This judgment corresponds with the eighth and
   ninth plagues of Egypt (Ex. x. 5), when Moses threatened that the
   locusts should "cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to
   see the earth."

   This judgment is now to be more particularly described in verses -3-11.

   The Structure is as follows:--

   k. ix. -3-11.  The Locusts coming on the Earth.

        k |     m |     o | ix. -3.  Their power.
                                   p | ix. 4, 5-.  Their commission.
                                           q | ix. -5-.   Their
   continuance. ("5 months.")
                                                   n | ix. -5-10-.
   Description of locusts.
                 m |     o | ix. -10-.  Their power.
                                   p | ix. -10-.  Their commission.
                                           q | ix. -10.  Their
   continuance. ("5 months.")
                                                   n | ix. 11.
   Description of their king.


   Here we have the symmetrical statement which distinguishes their Power,
   Commission, Continuance, and Description; and shows the points which
   are important; and on which we are to dwell.

   ix. 3. And out of the smoke there came forth locusts into the earth:
   and there was given to them power, as the scorpions of the earth have
   power.]     These were no ordinary locusts. Those that came in the
   plagues of Egypt were no common locusts either, for we are told "before
   them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be
   such" (Ex. x. 14). Ordinary locusts have "no king" (Prov. xxx. 27); but
   these have; and his name is given (verse 11). They seem, from their
   description, to be a kind of Infernal Cherubim. The horse, the man, the
   lion, and the scorpion are combined in them. They are called locusts,
   though they are supernatural and, apparently, incapable of being
   killed. But of this we shall see more as we proceed.

   4. And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the
   earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but should injure the men
   [207] who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.]     Common
   locusts eat up and destroy only vegetation (Ex. x. 5, 12, 15): beyond
   this they are not injurious. But these, from the bottomless pit, are
   designed for a very different purpose. Human beings are the objects of
   their assaults. Though released from the pit, they cannot go beyond the
   power "given" to them. A similar limitation is seen in Ezek. ix. 4-6.

   5. And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that
   they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the
   torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man]      Here is another
   limitation. Under the second Seal there is no such limit. "Torment"
   applies in a special manner to demons (Matt. viii. 29; Rev. xiv. 10,
   11; xx. 10). The duration of this plague is fixed. It is to last "five
   months." A similar fixed date is given in Num. xi. 19, 20: "a whole
   month." In 2 Sam. xxiv. 13, also we have "seven years," "three months,"
   and "three days," as the fixed limit of certain judgments. These
   periods are always taken literally. Why not this? The time limit of
   these infernal locusts corresponds with that of ordinary locusts, which
   is five months (from May to September).

   6. And in those days shall men seek death and shall in no wise [208]
   find it; and shall desire to die, and death fleeth [209] , from
   them.]     "In those days" refers to the period of "five months"
   mentioned in the previous verse. The result of the plague is not the
   producing of repentance; but only a desire of death. A similar state of
   things is foretold in Jer. viii. 3: "Death shall be chosen rather than
   life by all the residue that remains of this evil family." How this
   desire is to be thwarted we are not told; it may be part of the result
   of the torment. This one feature of the plague proves that it must be
   future and literal: for no period in history is known where such a
   condition of things lasted for "five months." There have always been
   isolated cases where men have sought death (1 Kings xix. 4); but this
   is to be universal.

   7. And the likenesses of the locusts were like to horses prepared for
   war: and there were upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold,
   and their faces were as the faces of men.]     Four verses are given to
   this description, so that the matter is evidently important. Their size
   is not given. The words "like" and "as" occur nine times. In verses 7
   and 8 we have the fore-part described; in verse 9 the middle part; and
   in verse 10 their hind part. Joel has a description of similar beings
   (See Joel ii.).

   8. And they had hair, like women's hair, and their teeth were like
   lions' teeth. (9) and they had breastplates like iron breastplates; and
   the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
   rushing into battle.]     Some ordinary locusts have hair. See Jer. li.
   27, "locusts bristling with hair." [210] Joel i. 6 has two references
   to the lions' teeth.

   10. And they have tails like scorpions, and stings were in their tails:
   and their power (or license) is to injure men five months.]     Here is
   developed what was only alluded to in verse 5. This discloses their
   origin, from the bottomless pit. The action, commenced in verse 5, is
   suspended so that their description might be completed.

   11. And they have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name
   in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath his name Apollyon.]
   It is a special characteristic of ordinary earth-born locusts that they
   have "no king" (Prov. xxx. 27), but these awful beings from the Abyss
   have a king. It is beside the point to say this king is Satan, for his
   special name is given. The Wild-Beast is twice described as coming up
   "out of the bottomless pit" (ix. 7 and xvii. 8). The name is evidently
   important, as it is given in two languages. They are equivalent as to
   their meaning, which is Destruction. It is literally the name of the
   bottomless pit, in Hebrew. It is distinguished from Sheol (See Job
   xxvi. 6; xxviii. 22. Ps. lxxxviii. 11. Prov. xv. 11; xxvii. 20). The
   name of the pit is given to the angel of the pit, [211] and means
   Destroyer. Hence his name in Jer. iv. 7; vi. 26. Isa. xvi. 4. Dan.
   viii. 24, 25; ix. 26; xi. 44.

   12. The first woe is past; behold, there are coming yet two woes after
   these things.]     The awful character of these three Woe-Trumpets is
   seen from what we are told of the first. The mighty forces of heaven
   and hell are gathering for the final conflict. We have here some of the
   outpost work, which gives an indication of what is to follow. From Joel
   ii. 11 we learn that Almighty God Himself will lead on His own great
   army.

   "Jehovah shall utter his voice before his army;
   For his camp is very great:
   For he is strong that executeth his word:
   For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible;
   And who can abide it?"

   On the other hand, one of Satan's superior officers, "the angel of the
   abyss," Abaddon, leads forth this great division, and forms part of the
   Satanic force to be brought against the King of kings. All is clear and
   simple and plain if we read this as one of a series of literal
   judgments which is to take place in the "day of the Lord." As literal
   and real as were the plagues of Egypt. But the moment we turn to the
   opinions of men, we are landed, as Alford himself says, "in an endless
   Babel of allegorical and historical interpretation."

   It seems a terrible descent from these awful and sublime realities to
   come down to the petty and trivial views of man with regard to them. We
   must, however, give our readers an idea of some of the interpretations,
   so that they may thankfully return to, and rest on, the simple
   statements of God's Word.

   The most common interpretation sees the fulfilment of this judgment in
   the Invasion of Europe by the Turks. In that case, the "star" is said
   to be Mahomet. His "fall from heaven" means that his family was once
   high and wealthy; he being an orphan and poor. "To him was given the
   key of the bottomless pit:" i.e., "he professed to receive a key from
   God." So that in his case profession was evidently possession! How he
   opened the pit the interpreters do not tell us, but the "smoke" was his
   false teaching. Out of the pit came the locusts. Arbah in Hebrew means
   a locust. That is quite near enough with them for Arabians, though
   there could hardly be Mahommedans before Mahomet. The locusts were
   forbidden to destroy men; but the Arabians killed off just a few:--
   50,000 in one battle, 150,000 in another, etc. Indeed Mahomet commanded
   slaughter (See Koran xlvii. 409). [212] Elliott gets over this command
   "not to kill" by saying it means "not to annihilate them as a political
   body"!

   The "crowns like gold" were the turbans of linen. "Faces as men" means
   courage. "They had hair as women:" this refers to the horse tail
   decorations worn by the Pashas on their heads; one, two, or three, to
   distinguish their respective rank and dignity. Here, the Scripture says
   all the locusts, not merely certain leaders!

   Dr. Cumming held that their breast-plates as of iron "denotes their
   invulnerability." The trouble with this interpretation is that
   thousands of the Mahommedans were slain in battle. The tails and
   stings, however, baffle the interpreters! The sparing of the sealed
   also is difficult with the Protestant interpretation, because Rome and
   the Pope were untouched by the Saracens. Their duration also, "five
   months," is another difficulty. This, according to "the year-day
   theory," becomes 150 years, whereas the Saracenic invasion lasted over
   400 years, and has continued to this day. Twice the Holy Spirit
   mentions this period, "five months," as though to emphasize it and
   impress us with the fact.

   Others tell us that the star was Luther. Let our readers try the
   puzzle, and see how it works out, in view of the Reformation blessings
   which Luther was the means of conferring on the world.

   No wonder Alford gives it up. Moses Stuart gives it up. Hengstenberg
   and others give it up. No wonder that most Bible-students have given
   the whole book up, in despair of ever understanding it.

   What God says is plain enough. He does not ask us to understand it. He
   asks us to believe it; and this, by God's help, we mean to do.

   He has promised us a blessing if we do this. But man asks us to choose
   from his Babel of interpretations; and gives up, instead of a blessing,
   only the curse of confusion.


   E., THE SIXTH TRUMPET (or Second Woe)
   (ix. 13-- 14).

   The Sixth, or "second Woe" Trumpet is set forth with more detail than
   any of the others: no less than thirty-three verses being devoted to
   its description. Like the fifth Trumpet (or first Woe) it is
   distinguished from the first four by being introduced by a "voice." In
   the former it was the voice of "an eagle flying in mid-heaven;" in this
   latter, it is the voice "from the four horns of the golden altar which
   is before God." Coming from this altar it seems to say that we have
   here the continuation of the answer to the prayers of vi. 10.

   Coming from the "four horns," the direction goes forth to the four
   quarters of the earth.

   But the Structure will give us the scope of the whole.

   The literal fulfilment of this judgment, interpreters will not have at
   any price. It is altogether too much too ask them to believe it. Stuart
   says it is symbol "excessive and unnatural." Of course it is
   "unnatural," simply because it is supernatural. So we believe is the
   Structure:--

   h. ix. 13--xi. 14.  The Sixth Trumpet (2nd WOE).

   h |     r |     t | ix. 13-.  The Sixth Angel (2nd WOE Trumpet).
                       u | -13-.  His sounding.
                           v | -13.  The Voice from the altar.

   "Voice from heaven."
                                                               b | -4.

                                   x | 9-11.  Execution of command.
                                       y | xi. 1-14.  Result:  The Two
   Witnesses.


   ix. 13. And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice
   from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God.]     In
   the earthly Tabernacle and Temple the golden altar is described as
   standing "before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, where I
   will meet with thee" (Ex. xxx. 6; xl. 3). Here, there is no veil; and
   the voice comes from "before God."

   The sixth angel is not only to blow his trumpet, but is also to obey
   the command. The utterance of this voice from the Altar is important
   enough to have its own Structure, and the members w. and x. may be
   expanded thus:--

   w. and x., ix. 14, 15.
   The Command and its execution.

       w |     a | ix. 14-.  "Loose the four angels."
                       b | -14-.  Bound.
                           c | -14.  Place.  Euphrates...
       x |     a | ix. 15-.  The four angels loosed.
                       b | 15-.  Prepared.
                           c | -15.  Time.  "An hour and...


   ix. 14. Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet,
                       "Loose the four angels which are bound at the river
   Euphrates."
   15. And the four angels were loosed, who had been prepared for the
   hour, and day, and month, and year, that they should kill the third
   part of men.]      These four angels cannot be identified with any
   others; for they are "bound." There can be no doubt about their being
   "delivered into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto (or for)
   judgment" (2 Peter ii. 4). This is the judgment for which they (four of
   them at least) are "reserved" and "prepared" or ready. In Jude 6 we are
   again told of the angels which are "reserved in everlasting chains
   under darkness, unto (or for) the judgment of the great day." Not only
   that they should be then judged, but that they should be the executors
   of God's judgments also in that great day which we are now studying and
   learning about in the Apocalypse. There are other "in-prison spirits"
   (1 Pet. iii. 19), to whom the Saviour's triumph was proclaimed at His
   resurrection; not for their comfort or blessing, but for the
   proclamation that the price of Redemption had been paid, and the work
   done which should hereafter be celebrated in Rev. v., when the
   worthiness of the Lamb that was slain should be proclaimed, not only to
   Tartarus, but to all Creation. [213]

   These angels are at present "bound." Satan will be bound by-and-by (xx.
   2-7). But before that day a further division of the Satanic forces is
   to be let loose upon the earth.

   Why "at the river Euphrates" we are not told. What connection there may
   be between Babel and the Abyss we do not know. Seeing that Satan's
   earlier activities were connected with that region, there must be some
   appropriate reason. The Euphrates is associated with the coming
   judgments of the great day. See Jer. xlvi. 4-10 (RV.)

   "Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen,
   And stand forth with your helmets;
   Furbish the spears, and put on coats of mail.
   Wherefore have I seen it?
   They are dismayed
   And are turned backward;
   And their mighty ones are beaten down,
   And fled apace, and look not back
   Terror is on every side, saith the Lord
   Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape;
   In the north, by the river Euphrates, have they stumbled and fallen.
   Who is this that riseth up like the Nile,
   Whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
   Egypt riseth up like the Nile,
   And his waters toss themselves like the rivers:
   And he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth:
   I will destroy the city, and the inhabitants thereof.
   Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots;
   And let the mighty men go forth:
   Cush and Put, that handle the shield;
   And the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.
   For that day is a day of the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
   A day of vengeance
   That he may avenge him of his adversaries;
   And the sword shall devour and be satiate,
   And shall drink its fill of their blood:
   For the Lord, the Lord of hosts, hath a sacrifice
   In the north country by the river Euphrates."

   From the same quarter will come these future and greater judgments.

   For greater transgressions (verse 20, 21) shall a greater army, not of
   men, but of evil spirits, come forth. See Jer. iv. 13, 29 (RV.)

   "Behold he shall come up as clouds,
   And his chariots shall be as the whirlwind.
   His horses are swifter than eagles.
   Woe unto us! for we are spoiled...
   The whole city fleeth from the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;
   They go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks:
   Every city is forsaken,
   And not a man dwelleth therein."

   These four angels, now bound, we are distinctly told are "reserved unto
   judgment." The word is (...) (eis) unto, with a view to judgment (not
   merely to being judged); and this judgment is that of "the great day."
   They are reserved for the particular appointed moment; the moment of
   this their loosing. There seems to be little doubt as to the meaning of
   the period of time. It does not imply the duration of the judgment, but
   the preparation for the particular moment which has been appointed by
   God. The one article and one preposition before the four times, unites
   them: whereas had the article and preposition been repeated it would
   have implied the separation of the four which, added together, would
   make a period of more than thirteen months. As it is, it denotes the
   appointed hour of the appointed day of the appointed month of the
   appointed year. The emphasis on the words "prepared" or "reserved"
   supports this interpretation. Finally, the general object is stated, to
   be particularised below.

   We now come to the description of these "horsemen"; and from this it is
   to be seen that they were not human beings of any kind. Difficulties
   have been made on account of the vast number of these horsemen, and had
   they been human beings, we could well understand it. But spirits are
   "legion," and no difficulties can arise from their number.

   First we give the Structure of y.

   y., ix. 16-21.  The Horsemen.

       y |     d |     f | ix. 16, 17-.  Description.  Number.  Heads and
   breastplates.
                               g | ix. -17-.  Mouths.
                                       h | ix. -17.  Agency:  "Fire."
                                               e | ix. 18-.  Result:  Men
   killed.
               d |                    h | ix. -18-.  Agency:  "Fire."
                               g | ix. -18, 19.  Mouths.
                        f | ix. -19.  Description.  Power.  Heads and
   tails.
                                               e | ix. 20, 21.  Result:
   Men not killed.


   ix. 16. And the number of the [214] armies of the horsemen was two
   myriads of myriads: [215] (I heard the number of them). (17) And thus I
   saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them having
   breastplates fiery, and hyacinthine, and sulphureous: and the heads of
   the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths goeth
   forth fire, and smoke, and brimstone. (18) By these three plagues [216]
   were the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the
   brimstone, which goeth forth out of their mouths. (19) for the power of
   the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails [217] : for their
   tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do injure.]

   This is the description of these supernatural beings. They are not
   human. They come from below. We know of nothing like them. When God
   thus describes them nothing ought to be easier than to believe what He
   says. They need no explanation. This description is given to explain
   them to us. Is it not easier to believe they are what God says they and
   their spirit riders are, than to believe what Dr. Adam Clarke says they
   are? He says they are brass cannon, ornamented with lions' heads cast
   at their mouth and at their breach. He adds that nothing could better
   describe "gunpowder" than "the fiery sulphurous smoke which goeth forth
   out of their mouths." We find this much more difficult to believe. And
   our difficulties are not less when, again, we are asked to believe that
   this was fulfilled in the taking of Constantinople by the Turks! Mr.
   Elliott says that the horses and tails refer to the horse-tails worn by
   the Pashas! Dean Alford says: "I will venture to say, that a more
   self-condemnatory interpretation was never broached, than this of the
   horse-tails of the Pachas." But the Turks still rule in Asia. Are they
   like these horsemen? Cannon were used on both sides of that war. Why is
   it, that one side is so different from the other?

   It is not as though we had anything here unheard of before. It is
   wonderful, truly; but that is just what God said the future plagues
   were to be. "The Lord will make thy plagues wonderful" (Deut. xxviii.
   59). "I will do marvels which have not been done in all the earth, nor
   in any nation" (Ex. xxxiv. 10).

   When Israel would trust in the horses of Egypt they were warned that
   their riders and horses were "flesh and not spirit" (Is. xxxi. 3). Here
   we have horses that are spirit, and not flesh. In Jer. viii. 17,
   Jehovah says "Behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
   which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord"
   (read 13-17).

   The number of these infernal horsemen is also wonderful, two hundred
   millions! John says "I heard the number of them" (verse 16). Twice he
   refers to it. And why not? What is it that makes man hesitate to
   believe God? These, as we have said, are no mere human beings: they are
   wicked spirits; and Are not these legion and innumerable?

   The results of this plague which follow the sounding of the sixth
   Trumpet are given in the concluding portion of this chapter.

   20. And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues
   neither repented of the works of their hands,]     And we know not that
   these may be; nor the awful form of idolatry hinted at in these verses.
   The expression "works of their hands," always points to idolatry (Deut.
   iv. 28. Psalm cxxxv. 15). And here, it is idolatry of the grossest
   kind.

   that they should not worship the demons, nor the [218] idols which are
   golden, and silver, and brazen, and stone, and wooden: which are
   neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk:]    This cannot possibly
   refer to the Church. No Christian of any kind worships demons; for
   these are always evil. (See Matt. x. 1-8; xii. 43-45. 1 Cor. x. 20. 1
   Tim. iv. 1. Compare Deut. xxxii. 17). This evil is spoken of in Deut.
   xxxi. 29, as recurring "in the latter days."

   Spiritism, which is now making rapid strides, is the forerunner of all
   this; and will surely develop into what is referred to in these verses.
   Planchette is becoming a household god with many, and is openly
   advertised in the Spiritist magazines and newspapers. Thousands are
   being "guided" by "Crystals," Planchette, and evil spirits at the
   present moment. They are "lying spirits," as the scripture calls them.
   (1 Kings xxii. 22, 23. 2 Chron. xviii. 21, 22). "Deceiving spirits"
   they are called in 1 Tim. iv. 1, pretending to be whom they are not,
   and thus gaining a hearing with many. They do speak; and hence speaking
   is specially excluded here. It says only that they are not able to see,
   or hear, or walk. It is the final and full development of what is
   called "Spiritualism" which is here referred to, and which calls for
   the plague of this sixth Trumpet. If Spiritists could see the end to
   which they are rapidly approaching, some might be alarmed; and many
   ministers and religious professors would be prevented from dabbling in
   the Bible-forbidden "mystery of iniquity." And if Christians, at large,
   could realize, in only a small degree, the awful nature of these coming
   judgments and plagues, they would welcome and be thankful for any
   evidence which exposed and be thankful for any evidence which exposed
   their real character and end.

   21. And they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries (or
   spiritualism), nor of their fornication (which will be a great feature
   of the coming religious apostasy), nor of their thefts.]     These
   "sorceries" are the dealings of men with spirit-agencies; accepting the
   teaching of evil angels and deceiving spirits (1 Tim. iv. 1). The word
   occurs only here, xviii. 23, and Gal. v. 20, where it is rendered
   "witchcraft." It is used of the Egyptian sorceries [219] (Exod. vii.
   22) and of the Babylonian (Is. xlvii. 9, 12).

   No wonder God has so solemnly warned us against these things, and no
   wonder such awful judgments are to be visited upon them. (See Lev. xix.
   31; xx. 6, 27. Ex. xxii. 18. Deut. xviii. 10. 1 Sam. xxviii. 7. 1
   Chron. x. 13. Isa. viii. 19. Acts xvi. 16; &c., &c.)


   z., x. 1, 2. "Another Angel."

   We have considered the sounding of the sixth Angel and its results as
   described in "r" (ix. 13-21), we now have "Another Angel" in "s" (x.
   1-4); and then to complete the whole scene, we have, in "r" (x. 5--
   14), his actions and their results set forth on exactly the same lines
   as those of the sixth Angel, in six particulars. The description and
   activities of this -- "another angel" (x. 1-4), differ from that of the
   sixth Angel, and his own subsequent activities (x. 5-- 14). While the
   sixth Angel's has six members, this, "another angel," has only four
   ("s"). The following is the Structure of the first of these four
   members:

   a., x. 1, 2.  "Another Angel."

       a |     i | x. 1-.  His descension from heaven.
                       k | -1-.  His accessories.  (Cloud; Rainbow).
                               l | -1-.  His person:  (face as the sun.)
                               l | -1.  His person:  (feet as pillars of
   fire.)
                       k | 2-.  His accessories.  (The little book.)
                i | -2.  His station on the earth.


   TRANSLATION OF "a." (x. 1, 2).

   x. 1. And I saw another mighty angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed
   with a cloud: and the [220] rainbow was upon his head, and his face was
   as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: (2) and he was holding
   [221] in his hand a little scroll opened [222] : and he set his right
   foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth,]     We are here still
   under the effects and consequences of the sounding of the sixth
   Trumpet. It is not till xi. 14, that we have the announcement of this
   "second woe" trumpet as being "past." As chap. vii. was Episodal to the
   sixth Seal, so chaps. x.-- 14 are Episodal to the sixth Trumpet. It
   continues the same prophecy of judgment, but introduces new details
   connected with that judgment; and new subjects and phases of it.

   It is not of the Trumpet Angels, but "Another" and a "mighty" one. His
   descent is with great majesty; and the cloud betokens his high dignity;
   for the cloud is generally associated with Divine movements (Ps. xviii.
   11; civ. 3. Is. xix. 1. Ezek. i. 4. Matt. xxiv. 30. Rev. i. 7).

   He comes "down from heaven," as the great antagonist of the "angel of
   the abyss," who comes up from below, and is enveloped in the cloud of
   the smoke of the pit.

   The book opened, or which had been opened (according to the revised
   reading, noted above) points us to chap. v., and seems to show that
   nothing now remains but to sound the seventh and last Trumpet. This,
   the angel says (in verse 6), shall take place without further delay.
   The sealed book has been opened; and now the little book, not sealed,
   discloses new directions. John devours its contents and continues his
   prophetic duty; while the judgments take different forms and have
   different subjects. Its contents must surely refer to the future, and
   begin where the other book (chap. v.) ends. Moreover, it relates
   specially to Israel and Israel's ancient enemy, Babylon. Michael is the
   mighty angel that "standeth" for the children of Israel (Dan. xii. 1).
   He is called with reference to Israel, "Michael your prince" (Dan. x.
   21; compare verse 13, Jude 9, and Rev. xii. 7). There is no reason why
   we should take this Angel to be Christ. True, Christ is sometimes
   called "the Angel of the Covenant," but He is not "another" angel
   (i.e., another of the same king, as the word (...) implies). It says
   "another angel." Let us leave the words as meaning what they say.

   Everywhere else in this book Angels mean Angels, and are always
   distinct from Divine Persons. They are, throughout, the ministers of
   the Divine will. They are invested with such delegated glory and
   attributes as befits their special missions respectively. It may well
   be the "strong angel" of chap. v. 2 or viii. 3; but there is no need to
   identify him, as he is not identified here in this scripture.

   The setting or planting of this feet on sea and land is the formal
   taking possession of both; or the formal expression of the purpose to
   do so. In Deut. xi. 24 it was said to Israel, "every place whereon the
   soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours." Judgment has long since
   been pronounced (John xii. 31; xvi. 11). A judgment-summons has been
   issued (Rev. v.), and now, at length, execution is to be put in. The
   right to execute this judgment has been established in the fifth
   chapter; and here we have the assertion of that right, and the
   expressed determination to enforce it.

   In verses 3 and 4 we have His cry. The following is the Structure:

   b., x. 3, 4.  His cry.

   b |     m | x. 3-.  Occasion.  "and when...
                   n | -3.  Action.  "Seven thunders uttered...
            m | x. 4-.  Occasion.  "and when...
                   n | -4.  Action.  "I was about to write...


   x. 3. And he cried with a loud voice, even as when a lion roareth: and
   when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices. (4) And when
   the seven thunders had [223] spoken, I was about to write: and I heard
   a voice from heaven, saying [224] "Seal up the things which the seven
   thunders spoke, And do not write them."]

   It was not a cry of distress or fear; but a shout of power, telling of
   the coming execution of judgment. The prophets have foretold of this
   roaring cry, which the Lord, by His agents and messengers, will cause
   to be heard. (See Joel iii. 16. Jer. xxv. 29-31). This cry is at once
   answered by a "voice from heaven" (verse 4).

   The definite article here marks these seven thunders. In chap. iv. 5
   they are spoken of generally; here the seven are particularised. They
   may have been consecutive, and heard by John "in heaven" as thunder,
   just as when a voice from heaven spoken to the Lord Jesus on earth some
   of the people "said that it thundered; others said, an angel spake to
   him" (John xii. 29). These may have been angel-voices, the effect
   (thunder) being put, by Metonymy, for the cause.

   John heard what the thunders said, and understood; for he was about to
   write. But God, in order to conceal them, ordered John not to write.
   Some would have us believe that these seven thunders are the Papal
   Bulls issued against Luther and the Reformation. [225] If this be so,
   then God sealed the book in vain! for all know what those thunders
   uttered. No, God's purpose in this book is very different from man's
   ideas of it. God has caused it to be written in order to make things
   known to us. Man treats it as though what is written is to conceal what
   is said, and make it incomprehensible.

   In chap. xxii. 10, John was told "Seal not the words of the prophecy of
   this book." But there were certain things sealed up, as there were with
   Daniel (see Dan. viii. 26, 27; xii. 9). A whole dispensation was to
   pass before Daniel's words could be known. But here, "the season is
   near."

   The actions of this angel and their results are then set forth in
   exactly the same form as were those of the sixth angel in ix. 13-21.
   They correspond in the same six particulars. See "r", where, in x. 5--
   14, we have them duly displayed.


   r. x. 5-11. Another Angel -- (continued).

   x. 5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and on the earth
   lifted up his right hand towards heaven (6) and sware by Him that
   liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and the things that
   are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the
   sea, and the things that are therein, [226] that "there shall be no
   longer delay:"]      i.e., time should no longer intervene. The
   allusion is still to the martyr's cry for vengeance in vi. 10, 11.
   Indeed, the whole series of these Trumpet-judgments (the seventh of
   which expands into the seven Vials) is the answer to those prayers (the
   formal offering of which takes place under the seventh Seal). It was
   said to them "that they should rest yet for a little season until their
   fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they
   were should be fulfilled."

   That time is now about to be fulfilled; and the execution of final
   vengeance, should no longer be delayed. That this is the meaning is
   clear from the words which immediately follows.

   7. But, in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, when he is about
   to sound his trumpet, then shall have been completed also the secret of
   God, as he announced the good news to His servants the prophets]
   The oath seems fatal to the theory that makes this angel to be the Lord
   Jesus Christ; especially in the face of Matt. v. 33-37. Jas. v. 12. But
   here, "another angel" is commissioned by God to make a formal
   announcement which only He Himself could know. "In the days" is a
   remarkable expression; and denotes that the days commence with his
   sounding, which develops into the seven final plagues of the seven
   Vials. These will complete the judgments which God had hitherto kept
   secret. It is quite unnecessary to take the word "mystery" or secret,
   here, in the Pauline sense. In the Ephesian Epistle it is used with
   reference to "the Body of Christ." Though before this (Rom. xi. 25 ) we
   have the secret of the duration of Israel's blindness spoken of; and in
   1 Cor. xv. 51, the "secret" that all should not die. In Matt. xiii. 10,
   11, and 34, 35 we have secrets concerning the kingdom. When we have
   these other secrets connected with Israel and the kingdom, why should
   we go to Ephesians and Colossians and fix on the "great" secret, and
   confine it to that? All are God's secrets, and each may be so called;
   but to introduce the Church of God here, is wholly unnecessary, because
   it tends only to create confusion where all is perfectly clear without
   it. The secret, here, refers to what had already been made known by God
   to his servants the prophets. The word "servants" identifies these with
   the Old Testament prophets. The great secret "concerning Christ and the
   Church" was made known only to the New Testament prophets; the prophets
   given to and for the Church. (See Eph. iv. 11. 1 Cor. xii. 28. Rom.
   xvi. 25, 26. So Eph. ii. 20 and iii. 5). God has revealed the secret of
   coming judgment to "his servants the prophets," as it is written:
   "Surely, Adonai Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret
   unto his servants the prophets" (Amos iii. 7). It is then in the Old
   Testament that we are to look for the announcements of these secrets;
   and we have done so in our many and constant references to the
   prophecies of the Old Testament which will receive their fulfilment in
   "the Day of the Lord." And in the days when the seventh angel shall
   sound they will be completed, for his sounding calls for the pouring
   forth of the seven Vials which will fill up the cup of Divine
   Vengeance, and answer the cry of the martyrs' blood.

   8. And the voice which I heard out of heaven I heard again speaking
   with me, and saying, "Go, take the scroll [227] which lieth open in the
   hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." (9)
   And I went up to the angel, saying unto him, "Give me the little
   scroll." And he saith unto me, "Take, and eat it up; and it shall make
   thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth shall be sweet as honey." (10) And I
   took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up; and
   it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it my belly was
   made bitter. (11) And they say [228] to me, "Thou must again prophesy
   against peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings"]     The
   eating of the book has its counterpart in Ezek. ii. 9 and iii. 3.
   Ezekiel ate the roll of the book given to him, and it was in his mouth
   as honey for sweetness. The bitterness he describes in verse 14,
   saying, "I went in bitterness and in the heat of my spirit." "Eating"
   is a Hebrew idiom for receiving knowledge; just as we idiomatically use
   the word digesting of considering what we have learnt. Ezekiel ate that
   he might speak of God's words (Ezek. iii. 4). So in John vi., the
   eating and drinking of Christ is explained as believing on Him; compare
   verses 47 and 48 with 53 and 54. See also 1 Cor. xii. 13 compared with
   Luke xiii. 15. In Ezek. iii. 10 it is explained as receiving in the
   heart; compare Deut. xxxi. 26. Jer. xxxi. 33. If any prefer to take it
   literally, there is no reason why they should not do so. It is better
   to err on that side, than to have the responsibility of erring on the
   other. In either case, the result is the same. There was sweetness in
   the assurance that the prayers of God's Israel, who had "cried day and
   night unto Him," were about to be answered. There was bitterness in the
   solemn announcements of the awful judgments which were to form that
   answer.

   The last sentence is peculiar and important. "They say unto me," i.e.,
   the Angel and the other voices which had before spoken, "thou must
   prophesy again against peoples," etc. (...) (epi), with the Dative
   following, means, literally, upon. It is never rendered "before,"
   except in this place. Six times it is rendered "against"; in Luke xii.
   52, 53. [229] In the RV. it is "over." Margin concerning.

   In the chapters immediately following (chaps. xi. -- xviii.) these
   prophecies are clearly seen. The contrast between "kings" and "nations"
   and "peoples" prove to us that we cannot take these kings as referring
   to systems religious or political.

   The contrast also with the historical interpretation is very clear. The
   angel here descends. This, we are asked to believe, is the "sun of
   righteousness rising over Europe." The cry like a lion is, we are told,
   "the preaching of Luther." But others tell us it was the Papal Bulls:
   others, that it was the "shout of the Wittenbergers when Luther burnt
   the Pope's Bull." But these voices and thunders came from heaven. They
   do not come from Rome, nor were they made in Germany. John was
   commanded to "seal up" what he heard; Luther made it known. We need not
   go further. The bare statement of such wild extravagancies are their
   own, sufficient and best, refutation.


   THE TWO WITNESSES.

   y., xi. 1-14.  The Two Witnesses.
   o^1., xi. 1, 2.  The Measuring of the Temple.

   The second Vision "on Earth," which consists of the six Trumpets, is
   given to us in three parts.

   (1)  The Immediate judgments or plagues which follow its sounding: (r.
   Ch. ix. 13-21).
   (2)  The Episode of "another mighty Angel;"  His oath and the little
   book:  (s. and r.  Ch. x. 1-11)
   (3)  The Two Witnesses:  (y. Ch. xi. 1-14).

   The connection of the three is continuous and close. It is the same
   angel who addresses John throughout: and the command "Rise, and
   measure" is only a sequel to "Seal up" (x. 4), and "Take, and eat" (x.
   9).

   Chap. xi., etc., is the fulfilment of the command "Thou shalt
   prophesy": taking prophesying as being witnessing in its widest sense.

   The descent of "another mighty angel" (x. 1) is, as we have seen, the
   formal taking possession of the earth in the name of the King of Kings,
   before actual occupation takes place (which is not till chap. xix.),
   though it is celebrated by anticipation in the next Vision "in heaven"
   (ix. 15). Two earthly Witnesses are added to the making of the claim as
   the accredited agents of the throne. They are the link between the
   judgments and men's sins which are the cause of them. Their witness is
   a confirmation of the faith of God's people then on the earth, and a
   witness to the "dwellers on the earth" that the end is near, and the
   interval of delay will last "no longer."

   (1) The angel takes possession by planting his feet on the sea and on
   the earth;
   (2) John takes possession by measuring out part of the territory
   occupied; and
   (3) The Two Witnesses take possession by prophesying in Divine and
   miraculous power.

   Just as after the sixth Seal there was an Episode relating the
   protection and deliverance of God's people then to be on the earth: so
   here, after or at the end of the sixth Trumpet, there is a similar
   Episode with a similar object, viz., to show that with all the external
   destruction that shall go on, there shall be the preservation of all
   that is essential to God's purposes, and to God's People.

   This third Episode of the sixth Trumpet is one whole, and is recorded
   in chap. xi. 1-14, completing at once the sixth Trumpet and the second
   Woe. The seventh Trumpet, which follows, is expanded into, and consists
   of, the seven Vials of wrath, which speedily prove that there is no
   more delay, and bring on the consummation in chap. xix.

   We do not propose, here, to trouble our readers with all the
   conflicting interpretations of this chapter. Some are half symbolical
   and half literal. Others are wholly ridiculous. Of course, the "The
   Temple is said to mean the church; the altar, Christ; the porch without
   means heretics and pseudo-Christians." Others hold that John was "not
   only ignorant of the future, but that he designed nothing more than to
   express his hopes, and give vent to his remaining Jewish sympathies for
   the literal temple and its ritual" (Stuart, Heinrichs, Ewald, Bleek,
   &c.).

   The Structure of the whole passages tells us that we are dealing with
   something far more important than all this; even with what shall yet
   take place in connection with future judgment-scenes preparatory to the
   final ejection of the great usurper from God's Earth, over which he has
   so long held sway.

   Let us therefore approach this scene, not with view, merely, of
   interpreting it; but of receiving it and believing it as God's own
   interpretation of real events which are yet to take place. God is
   telling us of some of the "marvels" and of the "terrible things" which
   He will do in the Day of the Lord. Let us not bring it down to "man's
   day" and treat it as mere Ecclesiastical or Roman history. This it is
   which causes all the difficulty, combined with the yet greater
   difficulty which man ever finds in believing God.

   The Structure of the whole passage is as follows:--

   y., xi. 1-14.  The Two Witnesses.

   y |     o^1 | p^1 | xi. 1-.  Person.  John.
                       q^1 | -1-.  What he was to do.  To measure.

   a half."
                                           "The second woe is past."

   xi. 1. And there was given to me a reed]     by whom, it is not said.
   It is indefinite, as in vi. 11; viii. 2, &c.

   like a measuring rod: and he [230] (i.e., the angel who continued
   speaking with him) said]     Bishop Wordsworth imagines that it is the
   reed that speaks. He says, "The reed speaks: it is inspired; the Spirit
   is in it; it is the word of God, and it measures the church: that is,
   the Canon of Scripture is the Rule of Faith." [231]

   Rise, and measure the Naos (or Temple) of God,] Observe the word is
   (...) (naos), the holy place; not (...) (hieron), the temple-building
   as a whole. The two words must always be carefully distinguished. It is
   a pity that the AV. confuses both by rendering them "temple"
   indiscriminately.

   This reed was a light measuring rod. The Heb. (...) (shevet), staff,
   also means a measuring-rod (Ps. lxxiv. 2. Jer. x. 16; li. 19). In Ezek.
   xl. 3, etc., the object was for the building of a new Temple. Here
   (verse 2) it is for the destruction, as in Lam. ii. 8. 2 Kings xxi. 13.
   Isa. xxxiv. 11. Amos vii. 8, 9. It is also (verse 1) for protection, as
   in Zech. ii. 1-5. Part was holy and part profane. There is no
   difficulty whatever if we leave the Temple alone. But if we say (with
   Alford and others) that it means "the church of the elect servants of
   God, everywhere in this book symbolized by Jews in deed and truth,"
   then we create difficulties which are insurmountable; for how John was
   to measure the Church we are at a loss to understand.

   That there is to be a "Temple of God" in Jerusalem is clear from 2
   Thess. ii. 4, for Antichrist is to sit as God there; and "the
   abomination of desolation" is to be there set up (Matt. xxiv. 15).

   One would have thought that the words employed here would have
   effectually shut out the church from the interpretation. We read of the
   Temple, the Altar, and the Court of the Gentiles, which surely have
   nothing to do with the church of God. Even Dr. Adam Clarke admits that
   "this must refer to the temple of Jerusalem," though he confesses he
   does not know what to do with it! We confess that we have no wish to do
   anything with it. We know that it will be re-built, and once we
   recognise that, there is no need to fix the period at seven years after
   the church is caught up; but to understand that these seven years may
   be the Telos or last seven of some thirty or forty years of the
   Sunteleia. See THE PROMISES TO THE SEVEN ASSEMBLIES and THE FIRST
   VISION "ON EARTH," where it is shown that there is ample time for all
   this and much more to be done in bringing about the fulfilment of all
   that is written in this book. God has not yet done with His people
   Israel. They are already, though in partial blindness (Rom. xi. 25),
   feeling their way back to their land, and to a restoration of their
   national Polity. Since the year 1896, the Zionist movement has been at
   work to this end. We regard this as leading directly up to this longer
   period, the Sunteleia (ending with the seven years of Daniel's last
   week, the Telos), and after the church has been caught up, the movement
   will rapidly develop and issue in the re-settlement of the Jews in
   their Land and City in partial independence, but in unbelief. It may be
   at first under the suzerainty of Turkey, or the protection of the Great
   Powers; until he arises who will make a covenant with them, and bring
   on such events as will be the crisis or end of "the Great Tribulation."

   and the altar,]      By being mentioned separately from the Naos (in
   which was the golden altar or incense) it looks as though the brazen
   altar of sacrifice was intended. The word will suit either.

   and take account of those who worship therein.]      Although the
   Zionist movement does not openly profess to act under Divine authority,
   that is no reason why it should not be most religious. Hence there will
   be worshippers: and among the worshippers the 144,000 sealed for Divine
   protection; beside those who suffer martyrdom at the hands of the
   Beast, and those with whom he makes war.

   Such a condition of things will need a re-survey when God is going to
   take action. He will separate the chaff from the wheat, Israel from the
   Gentiles, and His "servants" from the "dwellers on the earth."

   In this command with regard to the worshippers, we must recognise the
   figure called Zeugma, by which one verb is used of two things, and is
   strictly appropriate only to the former. A second verb must be supplied
   for the second noun, properly related to it. We have here supplied the
   verb "take account of" (...); for measuring, while quite appropriate to
   building, is incongruous when used of persons.

   2. But the court that is without the Naos (or Temple) cast without, and
   measure it not; because it is given up to the Gentiles: and the holy
   city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.]      The Court
   of the Temple is thus distinguished from the Naos. The former is owned
   by God; the latter is rejected and delivered over to the Gentiles.
   These are distinguished in Luke i. 22.

   We must again remind ourselves that we have here what relates to the
   Earth. Had expositors noticed that this was the second Vision of what
   takes place "on earth," they could never have supposed that the Temple,
   etc., here was the Temple in heaven. To apply this measuring and
   treading down by the Gentiles to heaven betokens confusion of mind, and
   brings hopeless confusion into the Scriptures, besides showing a very
   poor idea of what heaven is.

   The outer court of this Temple is ordered to be rejected; and the
   reason is given. It is given over to the Gentiles. This, of itself, is
   sufficient to establish the fact that we are here in another
   Dispensation. During this present Dispensation Jews and Gentiles stand
   on the same level. There is "no difference" (Rom. iii. 22; both are
   equally sinners before God, and both need the same Saviour. The Church
   of God cannot be here, for in Col. iii. 11 we are distinctly told that
   now there is "neither Greek (i.e., Gentile) nor Jew, circumcision nor
   uncircumcision, Barbarism, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all
   and in all." But here (in chap. xi.) the Jews are again in remembrance
   for the father's sake, and the Gentiles are put back to the place which
   they occupied in the former Dispensation. This measurement of the
   Temple, etc., is the formal acknowledgment of the Jew again, and the
   re-grafting him on his own olive-tree; and it is the formal putting
   back of the Gentiles from the privilege and position which they hold
   under the present Dispensation. The "middle wall of partition," which
   is now "broken down" (Eph. ii. 14), is to be again built up, and this
   measurement is the proof of it.

   The "court" of the Temple and the city is given over to be "trodden
   under foot" by the Gentiles. It is given over to the Gentiles for a
   special treading down, and for a definite period. The period of 42
   months is connected with the measuring. It closely follows it in order
   of time. We dare not reverse the two events. This proves, again, that
   the Church cannot be here, because it could not be at one and the same
   time delivered from Papal oppression, and yet still be under that
   oppression. In other words the treading down of the true Church by
   Rome, preceded the Reformation (which is said by the Historicists to be
   denoted by the measuring); whereas, here, the order is the opposite.
   This, at once, effectually disposes of the historical interpretation.

   As to the period of "forty and two months" Alford truly says "no
   solution at all approaching to a satisfactory one has ever yet been
   given of any one of these periods. This being so, my principle is to
   regard them as still among the things unknown to the Church." [232] But
   why? Why does this period require any "solution" at all? When it makes
   known a fact to us as to the duration of a certain period, Why regard
   the period as "among the things unknown"? "Secret things (we read)
   belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed
   belong to us and to our children for ever" (Deut. xxix. 29). Surely
   this period of "forty two months" is among the things that are
   "revealed." It is not a "secret" thing; and therefore, being revealed,
   we are not to regard it as "unknown," but as among the things which we
   assuredly know: and that, upon Divine authority. The great "solution"
   of this (and similar difficulties) is to believe that the words mean
   what they say: that "months" mean "months"; and "forty-two" mean
   forty-two. There is no difficulty then. All is natural, simple and
   easy. The "city" is literal. The treading down is literal. The Gentiles
   are literal. Why is not the duration of their oppression of the holy
   city literal also? And when this duration is given to us as "forty and
   two months" (or 3 1/2 years), why should it need any so called
   "solution"? It matters not how great or learned the men may be who
   offer us these solutions. They are all vain imaginations; and mere
   fancy-work, which only obscures instead of elucidating the word of God.

   Something more than learning is needed when we come to His book. Faith
   is the great thing needed, and if we possess this we shall have to
   unlearn much that man has taught us.


   y., xi. 3-14. The Two Witnesses.
   o^3, xi. 3. Their Endowment and Testimony.

   In xi. 3-14 we have the account of the Two Witnesses, one of the most
   solemn and mysterious scenes of the whole Apocalypse. It is the test of
   all interpretations, and one over which many make shipwreck. The
   particulars of the mission of these Two Witnesses are given with great
   detail.

   In verse 3 and 4 we have, first, their Equipment and endowment; verses
   5, 6, their Judgments on their enemies and the elements; verse 7-10,
   their Sufferings; verses 11-12, their Reward; and verse 13, their
   Avengement. These divisions will be seen to be marked off by the
   Structures given below.

   xi. 3. And I will endow my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a
   thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.]
   Literally, it is "I will give," but as there is the Ellipsis of the
   object, it does not say what is given. The AV. supplies the word
   "power." The RV. supplies nothing, but renders it badly: "I will give
   to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy," etc. We have (with
   Tregelles) avoided both by rendering the word "endow," which includes
   "power," and whatever other gifts were necessary for their mission. The
   duration of their prophecy covers an exactly similar period as the 42
   months: for it is 1260 days. We are not told that it is the same period
   as the treading down, but it reads as though the two periods were
   synchronous. The computation is given in months, for these seem to have
   a special relation to judgments. The beginning and duration of the
   Flood is given in months. The Plague of Locusts is be "five months."
   The blasphemies and persecutions of the Beast are reckoned by months.
   But when it comes to man, the duration if his years are reckoned by
   "days" (Gen. xlvii. 9, 28. Ps. xc. 10, 12; cxix. 84, &c.). Our life is
   lived by days. And the testimony of these Two Witnesses is to be given
   by days, day by day.

   The period is given in three forms in the Apocalypse.

   Forty-two months -- xi. 2; xiii. 5.
   1260 days -- xi. 3; xii. 6.
   A time, times, and a half (3 1/2 years) -- xii. 14; and see Dan. vii.
   25; xii. 7.

   The duration of the period in which Elijah's prayer shut up the heaven
   corresponds with this, and is given as "three years and six months"
   (Luke iv. 25, Jas. v. 17).


   p^4, xi. 4. The Two Olive Trees

   xi. 4. These are (or represent) the two olive trees, and the two
   lampstands which stand before the Lord [233] of the earth.]      The
   Divine title here used tell us that the events here recorded refer to
   the Earth; for this is the special title which the Holy Spirit uses
   when right to dominion and authority in the Earth is asserted. The
   title is first used in Joshua iii. 11, 13 where Jehovah claims the
   right to give the Earth to whom He will (Ps. cxv. 16). But the
   reference is to Zech. iv., where, in verse 14, the title is again used.
   Now, while Israel is Lo-Ammi ("not my People"), the title used with
   respect to Israel is "the God of Heaven" (See Ezra, Neh., and Dan. ii.
   18, 28, 37, 44, &c.); i.e., the God who no longer dwells between the
   Cherubim, in the midst of His People; but who has withdrawn Himself
   from them and removed to a distance; God who is now known to Israel as
   "the God of Heaven." Hence, in Rev. xi. when He again assumes direct
   relationship with Israel and the Earth; it is as "the Lord of the
   Earth" that He will be known. The two Olive Trees in Zech. iv. are
   there explained as denoting ZERUBBABEL the prince, and JESHUA the high
   priest. And when it says here in Rev. xi. 4: "These (two Witnesses) ARE
   the two Olive Trees, the Figure is Metaphor, and the verb "are" means
   represents. "These represent the two Olive trees," etc. This is the
   Spirit's own explanation of these two Witnesses. Just as Zerubbabel and
   Jeshua were raised up, and gifted, and Divinely endowed, and protected
   against Satan's assaults, so in the coming day of Israel's
   acknowledgment by God, two other great Witnesses from God will be
   raised up, corresponding to them, occupying a similar position as the
   depositories of Heavenly power and wisdom, and exercising a similar
   ministry.

   The two Olive Trees represented two individuals then; and they
   represent two individuals here in this Scripture. They will be the "two
   Olive Trees" for their day, as Zerubbabel and Jeshua were in a former
   day.

   The Angel gave the essence of the meaning to Zechariah; and the same is
   the meaning here. The secret Divine supply of oil to these two Trees
   and Lamp-stands illustrates the great reality -- "This is the word of
   the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might (mar. armies), nor by
   power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" (Zech. iv. 6). That
   is to say, it was a material representation of mighty spiritual
   potencies which were coming forth from the Spirit of God to give
   success and power to Zerubbabel and Jeshua for the completion of the
   work in which they were then engaged. That work was the restoration of
   Jerusalem, its temple, and its worship. In like manner shall these Two
   Witnesses be spiritually endowed with still greater power for a greater
   work, which will be carried out in face of the opposition of more
   formidable enemies. In that day Satan was present to "resist" (Zech.
   iii. 1, etc.): and the Lord, who had "chosen Jerusalem," was present to
   "rebuke" him. So here, Satan will be indeed present; and his resistance
   will reach its highest point: hence these Two Witnesses must needs be
   equipped as witnesses never were before, in order to carry out and
   fulfil their testimony.

   Expositors have exhausted their ingenuity in endeavouring to answer the
   question, which they all ask, "Who are the two witnesses?" We do not
   ask the question, and therefore we have nothing to answer. Why cannot
   we leave them alone? If God wished us to know He could have told us.
   The fact that He has not done so ought to stop our mouths. The wildest
   extravagances have been indulged in from the earliest times, and it
   would fill very many pages if we were merely to name them. They would
   require no refutation, for they are all mutually destructive of one
   another. Alford says: "No solution has ever been given of this portion
   of the prophecy." He means, of course, no satisfactory solution, for
   the interpretations themselves are innumerable.

   Malachi (iii. iv.) speaks of Elijah as coming to restore all things;
   and the Lord Himself endorses it in Matt. xi. 14; xvii. 11-13. In one
   sense (He explains) he had come in the person of John the Baptist who
   ministered in the "spirit and power" of Elijah (Luke. i. 17). But this
   was conditional: "If ye will receive it." They did not receive it; and,
   therefore, in another sense he was yet to come. This undoubted
   prophetic truth has led some expositors to add another witness to
   Elijah, so as to make the "two" Witnesses here foretold. They are not
   agreed whether it should be Moses (as on the Mount of Transfiguration)
   or Enoch. So we must perforce wait. What is certain is, that in the
   coming day of Israel's recognition and in the days of the Beast, God
   will raise up two individual men, whom he will call "MY two witnesses,"
   and will endow them will wondrous powers to enable them to carry out
   the commission which He will give them. Beyond this it is neither
   necessary nor desirable for us to go.

   We now come to their power to inflict judgments, which is given us in
   verses 5, 6. It is important, for the Structure of these two verses is
   as follows:--

   q4, xi. 5, 6.  The Infliction of Judgments.

   q^4 |     s |     t^1 | 5-.  Injury.  "And if any man will hurt them
                           u^1 | -5-.  Retribution.  "fire proceedeth out
   of their mouth...
                      t^2 | -5-.  Injury.  "And if any man will them
                           u^2 | -5-.  Retribution.  "he must in this
   manner be killed.
              s |     t^3 | 6.  Power.  "These have power
                           u^3 | w^1 | -6-.  Object.  "to shut heaven
                                       x^1 | -6-.  Drought.  "that it rain
   not
                                           v^1 | -6-.  Time (total) "in
   the days of their prophecy
                       t^4 | -6-.  Power.  "And have power
                           u^4 | w^2 | -6-.  Object.  "over waters,
                                       x^2 | -6-.  Effect.  "to turn them
   to blood,
                                  w^3 | -6-.  Object.  "and to smite the
   earth
                                       x^3 | -6-.  Effect.  "with all
   plagues,
                                           v^2 | -6.  Time (occasional)
   "as often as they will."

   We have included the translation of the AV. in the Structure, but we
   give our own here, for the sake of uniformity:

   xi. 5. And if any one desireth to injure them, fire goeth forth out of
   their mouth (2 Kings i. 10; Jer. v. 14), and devoureth their enemies:
   and if anyone desireth to injure them, thus must he be killed. (6)
   These have authority to shut the heaven (1 Kings xvii. 1), so that no
   rain may fall during the days (the 1260 days) of their prophecy: and
   they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, (Ex. vii.
   19) and to smite (xix. 15) the earth with every plague, as often as
   they will]      It is impossible to make this harmonise with the powers
   and functions of any Ministry during this present Dispensation of "the
   gospel of the grace of God." Its ministers are to be "harmless" (Phil.
   ii. 15. Rom. xvi. 19). This is their characteristic. But this Vision
   refers to Judgment-times and Kingdom-scenes, affecting the Jew and the
   Gentile, but not the church of God. Alford's weighty comment on this is
   worthy of attention. He says [234] "this whole description is most
   difficult to apply, on the allegorical interpretation; as is that which
   follows. And, as might have been expected, the allegorists halt, and
   are perplexed exceedingly. The double announcement here seems to stamp
   the literal sense, and the (...) [if any one] and (...) [he must be
   killed] are decisive against any mere national application of the words
   (as Elliott). Individuality could not be more strongly indicated."

   Interpreters talk about the "political heaven"! We may well ask what is
   political rain? We can only say that Scripture knows nothing of either.


   r^4, xi. 7-13. The Completion of their Testimony.

   The completion of their testimony (xi. 7-14) marks a distinct portion
   of their history and description here given. It is as strongly
   emphasised as is the nature of it. This is shown by the beautiful
   Structure which sets it forth.

   Three things are shown to characterise the completion of their
   testimony:

   1. verses 7-10. Their Sufferings.
   2. verses 11, 12. Their Reward.
   3. verse 13. Their Avengement.


   r^4, xi. 7-13.  The Completion of their Testimony.

   r^4 |     a |     c | 7-.  Time.  "And when...
                           d | -7.  Death.  "The beast...
                               e | 8. 9.  The City.  Bodies lie in its

   see.
                                       b |     g | 12-.  The Voice from
   heaven.
                                                   h | -12-.  The
   Ascension.
                                                       i | -12.  Enemies
   see.
            a |     c | 13-.  Time.  "And the same hour...
                           d | -13-.  Earthquake.
                               e | -13-.  The City.  Tenth part falls.
                                   f | -13.  Enemies slain.

   No harm can come to them during their witness. Not till their testimony
   is completed can they be injured or overcome. Till then they are
   invulnerable. As with "the Faithful Witness" Himself, so with them. Not
   till His hour had come could His enemies lay their hands on Him. (See
   John vi.. 6, 8, 30; viii. 20; xii. 23; xiii. 1; xvii. 1, 11).

   xi. 7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the Beast
   that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war upon them (xii. 17;
   xiii. 7; xix. 19. Dan. vii. 21), and shall overcome them, and kill
   them.]      This shows that these Witnesses are upon the earth during
   the thirteenth chapter; and that the Beast is on the Earth during the
   eleventh chapter. The account of the rise of the Beast is postponed
   till ch. xiii., but his actual revelation must already have taken place
   a long time before. The events recorded in the twelfth chapter must
   also have then taken place. We must remember, therefore, that when we
   come to chap. xii., we are, chronologically, taken back and told what
   will have previously happened. Just as an author to-day takes us by one
   line of events up to a certain point, and then goes back, and by
   another line of events reaches the same point again. All through these
   judgments scenes, or, at any rate, the great part of them, the Beast is
   on the earth, and it is against him and his forces that the plagues of
   the Seals and the Trumpets are directed. This fact is often overlooked
   in the interpretation of chaps. vi.-xi., but it must be allowed its
   full weight in our present consideration of the Apocalypse. It is clear
   from this verse that the whole period of their testimony will be at an
   end when that which is here said shall take place. The allegorists
   attempt to escape this by assuming that it means any one complete
   delivery of it which other witnesses might have continued. But this is
   impossible; as is the interpretation of the Two Witnesses, as being the
   Old and New Testaments (as Bishop Wordsworth does). How these can
   become a corpse passes our understanding. For see the next verse.

   8. And their dead body [235] (or corpse) shall lie on the street of the
   great city, which is called spiritually Sodom, and Egypt,]

   Here, then, in the street of "the great city" Jerusalem, these two
   witnesses will be slain, and Ps. lxxix. will receive its fulfilment,
   for it is to this very time that it refers.

   "O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance;
   Thy holy temple have they defiled;
   They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
   The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
   fowls of the heaven,
   The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth,
   Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem,
   And there was none to bury them."

   The whole Psalm should be read in this connection, as well as Psalms
   ix. and x., which relate to these very "times of trouble" (ix. 9; x. 1)
   when the "wicked man," or "the man of the earth" oppresses and slays
   the saints of God.

   where their [236] Lord also, was crucified]      So jealous is the Holy
   Spirit over His words, that He effectually prevents any allegorical
   interpretation here. Lest anyone should for a moment think He meant
   "Sodom" and "Egypt," He not only says it is only "spiritually" called
   by these names, but also immediately adds "where their Lord also was
   crucified"; and yet, in spite of this, interpreters -- for example,
   Alford -- say, "not Jerusalem, which is never called by this name";
   i.e., "the great city." But it is so called in Neh. vii. 3, 4. Jer.
   xxii. 5, 7-9. (Compare Jer. v. 1. 2 Chron. xxxii. 6). One would think
   "where their Lord was crucified" would settle the matter. But, no! he
   says, "It is true, He was crucified at Jerusalem; but it is also true
   that He was crucified, not in, but outside, the city." Was ever such
   interpretation heard of? It is sufficient to notice that it does not
   say "in," but "where" (...). A Sunday-school child could tell us where
   the Lord was crucified; but these learned men cannot. They say "the
   great city" here means "the church of God"! Well, what is gained by
   this? Was "the church of God" the place where the Lord was crucified?
   And is "the church of God" spiritually called "Sodom" and "Egypt"? The
   fact is, that these proper names are used to describe the character and
   condition in a spiritual and moral sense. What the character of "Sodom"
   was, we know from Gen. xviii.; xix.; and 2 Pet. ii. 6. What that of
   "Egypt" was, we know from Ex. i. - xv.

   Jerusalem is compared to "Sodom" in Isa. i. 9, 10; iii. 8, 9. Jer.
   xxiii. 14; and in the Song of Moses, which refers to these very times,
   Deut. xxxii. 30-33. It is also spiritually likened to "Egypt" in Ezek.
   xxiii. 3, 4, 8, 19, because of the adoption of the customs and vices of
   Egypt. There is another reason why they may be spiritually so called;
   and that is, because both were visited with judgments and plagues
   similar to those described in this prophecy. But, beyond this, lest
   there should be any doubt left in the reader's mind, or any danger of
   being misled by the use of these names, it is added, "where their Lord
   also was crucified."

   9. And the peoples (lit., by Hebrew idiom, "some of the peoples")and
   tribes and tongues and nations, look upon their corpse [237] three days
   and a half, and do not suffer their [238] corpses to be put into a
   tomb. [239] ]      The "year-day" theory surely breaks down here, for
   corpses could hardly lie exposed for three years and a half! But to
   avoid this difficulty, we are told that these are not corpses!
   According to Elliott, the period is that which elapsed between the
   ninth session of the Lateran Council, and the posting up of his Theses
   by Luther at Wittenberg. This fulfils the prophecy, he says, "precisely
   to a day." But, unfortunately, he has to take the three years (from May
   5th, 1514, to May 5, 1517) as years of 365 days, and the half year
   (from May 5th, 1517 to October 31st of the same year) as a year of 360
   days; i.e., two days and a half short of the "precisely to a day." And
   yet in the face of this he exclaims "O wonderful prophecy! O the depth
   of the riches of the wisdom and of the foreknowledge of God!"

   Bishop Wordsworth is equally unfortunate, for he builds on the amended
   reading "tomb," or sepulchre (which he takes to mean monument), this
   fantastic interpretation, that Papal Rome (the Wild Beast) "has
   laboured that the two witnesses [i.e., the Old and New Testaments] may
   not be committed to the immortal monuments of Editions, Translations,
   and Expositions." It is fatal to this theory, (1) that (...) (mnema)
   never means anything but grave, tomb, or sepulchre, [240] and (2) that
   we are indebted to Papal Rome for the only edition of the oldest
   published Codex, of the Old and New Testament know as the Vatican Codex
   (B). But such interpretations need no serious disproof.

   The tenth verse, in which their enemies look upon their dead bodies, is
   thus constructed:


   f. xi. 10.  Enemies rejoice.

   f |     k | 10.  Dwellers on the earth.
               l | -10-.  Rejoicings.
               l | -10.  Torments.
           k | -10.  Dwellers on the earth.


   xi. 10. And they that dwell on the earth (the earth-dwellers)rejoice
   [241] over them, and make merry, [242] and shall send [243] gifts one
   to another: because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the
   earth.]

   The older commentators might have felt a difficulty in understanding
   how the whole earth could rejoice at an event happening at Jerusalem.
   But in these days of electric inventions, telephones, and wireless
   telegraphy, we all know how the next day the whole world sympathises
   and rejoices together. [244]

   But "the triumphing of the wicked is short" (Job xx. 5).

   11. And after three days and a half the breath of life (or life-spirit)
   from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great
   fear fell upon those who beheld them.]      The Two Witnesses are
   raised from the dead by the power of God (Gen. ii. 7. Job xxxiii. 4.
   Compare Ezek. xxxvii. 10). The rejoicing is soon turned into fear --
   great fear. Their Lord was raised to life in Jerusalem after three
   days, and they after a somewhat similar period. Like Him, too, they
   ascend up into heaven; but, unlike Him, this follows immediately on
   their resurrection.

   The twelfth verse is constructed as follows:


   b. xi. 12.  Ascension.

   b |     m | 12-.  Hearing.
                   n | -12-.  Invitation.
                   n | -12-.  Reception.
            m | -12.  Seeing.


   xi. 12. And they heard a loud voice out of heaven, saying to them,
   "Come up hither." And they ascended up to heaven in the cloud (Acts i.
   9); and their enemies beheld them]      The world they hear is "with
   power;" for immediately they ascend; and are for ever delivered out of
   the hand of their enemies. Their death, resurrection and ascension are
   all literal. This shows that the words, "first resurrection," in chap.
   xx., refer to the contrast between that and the second; it is the first
   (or former) of those two, and not the first that ever took place. Nor
   is this the only ascension. The Church shall have ascended long before
   these judgment scenes commence; and during those time we have the
   ascension of the great multitude of chap. vii., and the 144,000 of
   chap. xv., besides that of the Two Witnesses here recorded. The "great
   fear" of their enemies is completely justified; for judgment speedily
   follows, and the death of the Lord's Two Witnesses is avenged.

   This is recorded in verse 13:

   f. xi. -13.  Enemies Slain.

   o | -13.  Killed.
           p | -13-.  Number.
           p | -13-.  Remainder.
   o | -13.  Affrighted.


   xi. 13. And in that same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth
   part of the city fell,]      i.e., of the great city mentioned above.
   But how can this be if this great city is "the Church of God"? Why
   should a tenth part of "the Church of God" be thus judged because of
   sins of "the peoples, and tribes, and tongues and nations"?

   and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand men:]      "Name
   of men" is an Idiomatic expression for persons. Both in Scripture and
   in the Papyri (...) (onoma), name, is used of a person. The word (...)
   always means the number 1,000 and yet Elliott interprets this of the
   seven Dutch republics which were lost to the Papacy by the Reformation!
   so he takes these "names of men" literally, and says they mean "titles
   of dignity and command," such as Duchies and Lordships. Hence,
   perforce, the smiting down of these by the earthquake must denote the
   setting of them up, and establishing them in a better and independent
   position!

   and the rest became affrighted and gave glory to the God of
   heaven]      This giving glory to God is not equivalent to praising or
   blessing God. It is extorted, not by penitence, but by terror. The
   idiom is well known. See Luke iv. 15, where those referred to in the
   words "glorified of all," soon attempted to take the life of the Lord
   Jesus (verse 29). (See also Josh. vii. 19 (Sept.). Ps. cvi. 12-15. Mark
   vi. 20. Luke v. 26; xvii. 12-18; xviii. 43; xxiii. 47. John ix. 24.
   Acts xii. 23; xxiv. 25. Rom. iv. 20). The context here clearly shows
   the sense in which this is to be taken. God is said to be glorified
   when His power is acknowledged in an emergency; just as the magicians
   said to Pharaoh, "this is the finger of God" (Ex. viii. 19). And just
   as the ungodly admit the same thing every day. Even the demons
   acknowledge the Lord Jesus, and confessed His Deity.

   Here, it is only "the God of Heaven" who is acknowledged; not a
   covenant God (Jehovah) known and loved. Only a God at a distance,
   unknown and feared. We have already spoken of the title, "God of
   heaven," and its significance as occurring only here, and in chap. xvi.
   11. Ezra i. 2. Neh. i. 4. Dan. ii. 18, 19, etc.

   Thus ends the sixth Trumpet or "second Woe." Hence it is added:

   14. The second woe is past: behold, the third woe cometh quickly.]
   The second Woe consists of two parts: The Horsemen, and the Two
   Witnesses.

   The third Woe, which is the result of the sounding of the seventh
   Trumpet, occupies four chapters (xv.--); and after the sounding of the
   seventh Trumpet three chapters are interposed (xii.--), taking us back
   (probably) to a time prior to ch. iv.; conducting us by a different
   route to the same point; describing to us how it is the Wild Beast is
   to be revealed; and telling us the causes and consequences of his
   revelation. Then the seventh Trumpet is taken up again in chap. xv.

   The second Woe ends with the earthquake following on the ascension of
   the Two Witnesses. Theirs is a marvellous history. It comes upon us
   suddenly, as does the history of Elijah in 1 Kings xvii. 1; and the
   description of their course is soon told. In spite of all unbelief,
   misapplied learning, and fanciful interpretation, they will one day
   appear on the earth and fulfil their mission. Then this Scripture will
   be understood in all its simplicity and clearness.

                          The Third Vision "In Heaven"

   H3, xi. 15-19-.

   THE SOUNDING OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET.


   The Seventh Trumpet brings us back to Heaven and to the Third Vision
   seen there by John. For it is "in heaven" that the Trumpet is sounded.

   After it is sounded, we again hear the heavenly utterances which tell
   us of the design of this sounding. In xix. 1-16, heavenly voices again
   tell us of the completion of its effect. After it is sounded, and its
   object unfolded, there is a break; and an episode occupying chaps.
   xii., xiii. and xiv.; the effects of the sounding not being resumed
   till chap. xvi. 1, and occupying chaps. xvi., xvii., xviii.

   The Seventh Trumpet thus embraces the whole of the seven Vials, or last
   seven plagues, which make up the "Third Woe."

   The Seventh Trumpet, therefore, really reaches from chap. xi. 15 to
   xviii. 24, or even to xx. 5, for it takes in the whole of the remaining
   judgments, and consists of the remaining five pairs of Visions "in
   heaven" and "on earth," and occupies about one half of the whole
   Apocalypse. This shows us the importance of the Scripture on which we
   are now about to enter. It tells us also why the heavenly utterances,
   which follow on its sounding, anticipate the end, including the setting
   up of the throne of earthly dominion, the raising of the dead, "small
   and great," and the final judgment. All is anticipated by these
   heavenly voices, which are answered by the concluding utterances of
   chap. xix. in the seventh and final Heavenly Vision.

   In chap. xi. 7, the mighty angel declared that "in the days of the
   voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound, the secret of God
   should be finished": i.e., that it will be finished during the days
   covered by his sounding (embracing, as we have seen, the whole of the
   seven Vials, and bringing us down to xx. 15). The whole of God's secret
   purposes, the details of which were known only to Himself, will be
   accomplished.

   The whole of this great division, therefore, opens with the small
   section (xi. 15-19-), concerning the acts of sounding the Seventh
   Trumpet. The structure is as follows:--


   H^3, chap. xi. 15-19-.
   THE THIRD VISION "IN HEAVEN."

   The Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet. (3rd WOE)

   H^3 |     A | xi. 15-.  The sounding of the Seventh Trumpet in heaven.
                       B |     a | -15-.  Loud voices in heaven.
                                       b | -15.  Their utterance.
                       B |     a | 16.  The 24 Elders.
                                       b | 17, 18.  Their utterance.
               A | 19-.  The opening of God's Temple in heaven.


   xi. 15. And the seventh angel sounded his trumpet; and there were loud
   voices in heaven;]      Each seventh Seal, Trumpet and Vial is marked
   off from the preceding six by unmistakable signs, sufficient to show us
   that they are resumptive rather than continuous. Each going over the
   same ground to give particulars not contained in the others, bringing
   us to a crisis; and giving the other events in the corresponding
   period, but from a different point of view.

   This is called the "seventh" Trumpet, and it is the "last" of this
   special series. But it does not follow there will be none after: or,
   that a trumpet sounding before it may not also be called the "last,"
   relatively to another subject. In 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52, we read of "the
   last trumpet: for a trumpet shall sound." In 1 Thess. iv. 16, we read
   that the Lord "shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
   archangel's voice, and with the trump of God." This is the "last"
   Trumpet as regards the church of God, but not the last absolutely. It
   will be sounded long before these judgments begin, in order to raise
   His sleeping saints, and take them up with the living saints, to be
   with Him for ever. There will be another great trumpet after the great
   Tribulation, immediately connected with the Lord's Apocalypse. See
   Matt. xxiv. 31. This is subsequent to this "seventh Trumpet," for that
   Apocalypse is recorded in Rev. xix. So that the seventh Trumpet in Rev.
   xi. 15 is not the "last Trump," absolutely, but only relatively; for it
   is only the last of this series of seven. Moreover, this is neither
   called "the last": nor is it necessary for us to call it. The Trump in
   1 Cor. xv. 51, 52, is called the "last" with reference to the church of
   God. It is the Trump which shall close our connection with the earth;
   it will end up all longing expectation, and therefore there is a true
   sense in which it is our last Trump.

   The Trump of 1 Cor. xv. 51, 51, is the same that is mentioned in 1
   Thess. iv. 16. We have had so many positive proofs that these "Seven
   Trumpets" belong to another Dispensation altogether, that we cannot
   read this into our "calling on high" (Phil. iii. 14), where no trump at
   all is even mentioned, and confuse it with the trumpet which shall
   bring on the last of God's plagues and end up His judgment of the
   earth.

   The sounding of this Trumpet produces great activity and stir in
   Heaven, where it is sounded. It is nothing less than the proclamation
   of the coming Coronation of earth's rightful king (compare 2 Sam. xv.
   10, 1 Kings i. 39). It is the signal that, at length, the hour has come
   to herald the glorious news of the setting up and establishing of God's
   kingdom on earth. It is the announcement that the prayer of the ages --
   "Thy kingdom come" -- is about to receive its wondrous answer. For this
   is the subject of the loud voices in heaven.

   saying "The sovereignty [245] of the world is become the sovereignty
   [246] of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and
   ever." (Ex. xv. 18. Ps. x. 16. Dan. ii. 44; vii. 14).

   The whole subject is one of sovereignty. This is the whole matter which
   has been in question. And this question is now about to be settled by
   these final judgments of the seven Vials. The result is celebrated in
   this Vision "in heaven" by anticipation. It looks forward to the close
   of the whole book of Revelation. It is not till the events of chap. xx.
   have taken place that this change of sovereignty is consummated. "The
   kingdoms of the world" are represented as wild beasts, knowing no
   master and having no owner. This is God's view of all earthly
   governments. Government in the world, committed, for the present, to
   man, has never yet been exercised for God. Not only is His sovereignty
   not recognised, but even His suzerainty is rejected. It is folly to
   talk about "Christian kingdoms" or "Christian nations;" and it is worse
   than folly for ministers of the Gospel to occupy themselves with the
   taming of these wild beasts, instead of warning all of the coming
   judgments, which will destroy them altogether; and meantime witnessing
   of the "grace of God" to lost and helpless sinners. We are not
   referring to any lawful acts which we may do (as it were, in passing)
   to improve the condition of things, or to remove crying evils; but we
   are speaking of laying ourselves out for these things and making them
   our great aim; and especially of ministers of the Gospel so doing. What
   is wanted is, not a "Citizen Sunday," but a Sunday for God, when men
   will be told of what God's verdict is on all these things; of what His
   remedy for them is; and of what means He is going to take to set right
   all that is so wrong. A Sunday when men will be told that there can be
   no Millennium without Christ; and that there is no hope for the world
   until it comes under the direct sovereignty of God and of His Anointed.

   The very laws which God gave on Sinai, and the Divine Ritual of the
   Tabernacle and the Temple did not keep Israel from Religious Apostasy
   and political ruin. It ought therefore to be perfectly clear that there
   is no hope for the world in human laws or religions.

   Righteous government is the one great want of the whole world. The
   obtaining of this is the mighty spring of all political movements for
   Reform; and of all national conspiracies, and revolutions. It is this
   that give Anarchists the motive for their crimes. But man does not know
   or see (and there are so few to tell him) that there can be no
   righteous government for the world until the Righteous one shall come
   "whose right it is" (Ezek. xxi. 27) to rule in righteousness: and no
   peace for the earth until the Prince of Peace, whom man hath foully
   murdered, shall return to establish it. When he came, His object was
   angelically heralded as "Peace on earth" (Luke ii. 14); but when He had
   been rejected, His disciples knew there could be no "peace on earth"
   while the blood of the Prince of Peace cried for vengeance, and hence
   they sang of "peace in heaven" (Luke xix. 38). That is where our peace
   now is (Eph. ii. 14-17); and peace is now preached to sinners and
   rebels.

   All this, and more, is involved in this heavenly utterance. The coming
   kingdom is not "from this world" (John xviii. 36). It is not "from
   hence." It comes from heaven, and from thence we look for the coming
   King. Here will be the fulfilment of the second Psalm and many other
   similar scriptures.

   To the general utterance of the loud voices is added the special
   utterance of the twenty-four elders, which fills out the former with
   the details embraced in it.

   16. And the twenty-four elders, who, in the presence of God sit upon
   their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, (17) saying,

   "We give thanks to thee, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art, and who
   wast, [247] because thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned.
   (18) And the nations were wroth (Ps. ii. 1; xlvi. 6), and thy wrath is
   come, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to
   thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy
   name (i.e., Thee), the small and the great; and to destroy those who
   destroy the earth"]

   There are seven things here celebrated by anticipation. And the seven
   is divided into four and three. The last three are marked off by their
   belonging to the special appointed season in which they are to take
   place. The first four relate to four actions on the part of God, and
   their effects.

   The first act of taking His power is seen in the seven Vials (chap. xv.
   8), where the temple is filled with smoke from the glory of God and
   from His power. The wrath of the nations, and of God, are both
   mentioned in Ps. ii. 1, 5. In connection with this we may read many of
   the Psalms, which are proleptic, and therefore in like manner celebrate
   by anticipation: e.g., Ps. xciii. -- xcix., Ps. lvii., and others,
   which ought all to be read carefully through with reference to the
   particular time referred to in this utterance of the twenty-four
   elders. There are other Scriptures which refer to this time of wrath.
   Read Isa. xxvi. 20, 21 (RV.):--

   "Come, my People, enter thou into thy inner chambers,
   And shut thy doors about thee,
   Hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast:
   For behold, the Lord cometh forth out of His place
   To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity:
   The earth also shall disclose her blood,
   And shall no more cover her slain."

   (So, Isa. xxiv. 17-21; xxx. 27, 28, 30-33. Ezek. xxxviii. 16-23. Zeph.
   i. 2, 3, 14-16; iii. 8).

   In these judgments, under the seventh Trumpet, amendment or repentance
   is no longer looked for. All is wrath and vengeance. Jehovah at length
   replies to the reiterated cry of his people: "Arise, O God" Ps. iii. 7;
   vii. 6; xliv. 26. The time has come when the appeal of Ps. lxviii. 1-3,
   &c., shall be answered:

   "Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered:
   Let them also that hate him, flee before him.
   As smoke is driven away, so drive them away:
   As wax melteth before the fire,
   So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
   But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
   Yea, let them exceedingly rejoice."

   The last two great Witnesses of God will have finished their testimony,
   attested by miraculous evidences. Now, all further testimony is to be
   withdrawn, and vengeance is to take its course.

   The last three statements of the Elders' utterance relate to the
   appointed season ((...), kairos), which has come for their fulfilment.

   (1) "The time of the dead to be judged." This connects, therefore, the
   events of chapter xx. with the sounding of this Trumpet (see xx. 12,
   13). Resurrection also is included, for the dead, "small and great,"
   stand then before God for this judgment. Here we have more than mere
   avengement of the martyrs; or, righteous government.

   (2) To give the Reward (a) "to thy servants the prophets," as stated in
   chap. x. 7 (compare 2 Kings ix. 7). We have the same phrase in Dan. ix.
   6, 10, as well as in 2 Kings xvii. 13, 23; xxi. 10; xxiv. 2, &c. The
   Old Testament prophets have a pre-eminent place in the coming kingdom
   (not in the Church of God). See Luke xiii. 28. Matt. v. 10-12.

   (3) "And to the saints." This is a special term for the Old Testament
   saints, and is not to be confused with the usage of the word in the
   Pauline sense, where it is applied to the members of the Body of
   Christ; or with angels, or whom the word is also used in such passages
   as Deut. xxxiii. 2. In Ex. xxii. 31 it is used of holy men under the
   Law, as also in Ps. xvi. 3; xxx. 4; xxxi. 23; xxxiv. 9; l. 5.

   The "saints" here are those spoken of in Daniel vii. 18: "the saints
   shall take the kingdom" (see verses 22, 27). These are the "saints"
   against whom the Wild Beast will "make war" (Dan. vii. 21, 25). These
   are the "elect" of Matt. xxiv. 31; Luke xviii. 7; and the "saints"
   elsewhere spoken of in the Apocalypse. (See xiii. 7, 10; xiv. 12; xv.
   3; xvi. 6; xvii. 6; xviii. 24; xix. 8; xx. 9). These have their reward
   under this seventh Trumpet, and we see it actually bestowed on them in
   chap. xx. 4. This is the reward referred to in the Gospels, in such
   passages as Matt. x. 41, 42; xvi. 27; xxv. 34. Rev. ii. 23; xxii. 12.

   (c) "Them that fear Thy name, the small and the great." Note, that the
   Elders do not say "us." They again distinguish themselves from human
   beings. It was the special character of saints under the Law, to fear
   the Lord. See Josh. xxiv. 14. 1 Sam. xii. 24. Ps. xxxiv. 9. But the
   words here probably include Gentiles (as distinct from Israel, who, as
   the "holy nation," are called "saints").

   They are so distinguished in Ps. cxv., where we have first "Israel"
   (verse 9); then the "house of Aaron" (verse 10); then "ye that fear the
   Lord" (verse 11). Then in verse 13: "He will bless them that fear the
   Lord, both small and great."

   The seventh Trumpet includes as its last object:

   (3) "to destroy them that destroy the earth." This involves the
   destruction of Babylon, and of those who worship the Beast and receive
   his mark. It would also include the great destruction of the armies of
   Satan and the rebels who join it, in Rev. xx. 9. (Compare Isa. xxiv.
   21).

   With the destruction of these God's judgments end, and the "mystery (or
   secret) of God is finished" (x. 7), as well as "the mystery of
   Iniquity."

   This third vision "in heaven" closes with the words:

   xi. 19. and the temple (Naos) of God which is in heaven was opened,
   [248] and there was seen the ark of his covenant in his temple:]
   We have already seen that heaven is a place of grand and glorious
   realities; and not a place of airy nothings, as popular theology
   pictures it. There is a heavenly Temple, and heavenly worship, and a
   heavenly priesthood, on the pattern of which the earthly was modelled
   (See Ex. xxv. 40. Heb. ix. 23).

   The Apocalypse is the book of unveiling and of opening. Seven great
   openings characterise it.

   In iv. 1: A Door is opened in heaven.
   In vi. 1-9: The Seals are opened.
   In ix. 2: The Abyss is opened.
   In xi. 19: The Temple of God is opened.
   In xv. 5: The Tabernacle of Testimony is opened.
   In xix. 11: The Heaven is opened.
   In xx. 12: The Books of judgment are opened.

   The opening of the Heavenly Temple discloses the Ark of the Covenant,
   and speaks of the Covenant-keeping God redeeming His pledges of
   blessing to His People; and tells of judgment on His enemies.

   It is from this Temple that the judgments which follow, proceed forth
   (xiv. 15, 17; xv. 5, &c.; xvi. 17).

   This tells us that those judgments have respect to the restoration of
   His People Israel, and of the fulfilment of all His covenant promises,
   concerning the Land (Gen. xv.) and the throne (2 Sam. vii.), which were
   unconditional and therefore certain and sure. The Ark of the Old
   Covenant was concealed: this is revealed, and it is displayed as a
   token of Israel's salvation and of their enemies' destruction. The
   "secret" of God is finished (x. 7) because the Temple is laid open, and
   the Ark revealed.

   The Ark of the Old Covenant had stood closely connected with the
   Tabernacle and Moses; with the Land and Joshua; with the Kingdom and
   David; and with the Temple and Solomon. All are united here in
   connection with this Heavenly Ark of which the Earthly Ark was only a
   copy and a figure.

   Under this covenant is at length to be fulfilled all that was announced
   in the Song of Zacharias (Luke i. 68-79); but which, owning to Christ's
   rejection, has been since in abeyance:

   A |     "Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel:
             For He hath visited and redeemed His people,

       B |     And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
                In the house of His servant David;

           C |     As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
                    Which have been since the world began:

               D |     That we should be saved from our enemies,
                         And from the hand of all that hate us;

                   E |     To perform the mercy promised to our fathers,
                            And to remember his holy covenant;

                   E |     The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

               D |     That he would grant unto us, that we being
   delivered out of the hand of our enemies
                         Might serve him without fear,
                         In holiness and righteousness before him, all the
   days of our life,

           C |     And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the
   Highest;
                     For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to
   prepare his ways;

       B |     To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
                 By the remission of their sins,

   A |     Through the tender mercy of our God;
             Whereby the Day-spring from on high hat visited us,
             To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
   of death
             To guide our feet into the way of peace."


   The words printed in thicker type show us the great subject of each
   member. They may be more clearly seen if presented thus:

   A | 68.  The visitation of God.

           B | 69.  Its subject:  Salvation raised up.

                   C | 70.  Foretold:  by all His Prophets.

                           D | 71.  Its result:  Destruction of Enemies.

                                   E | 72.  Its basis:  The Covenant.

                                   E | 73.  Its basis:  The Oath.

                           D | 74, 75.  Its result:  Worship of Delivered
   Ones.

                   C | 76.  Fulfilled:  The Fore-running prophet.

           B | 77.  Its object:  Salvation known.

   A | 78, 79.  The Visitation of Christ.


   Thus, beautifully, has God the Holy Ghost emphasised for us what is
   included in His Covenant, of which the manifestation of the Ark of His
   Covenant, seen in His opened Temple in heaven, is at once the token and
   assurance. The revelation of the Ark of the Covenant is at once
   answered on earth by signs which betoken its meaning for the earth.

   That we reach a great crisis here, is evident. It anticipates the end,
   including the judgment of the great white throne in chap. xx. This
   Third Vision in heaven is followed by a Third Vision on earth, which
   fitly answers it. Before all that it involves and includes is
   fulfilled, we are taken back to the foundation of the world, in order
   to have various matters explained to us; and we are shown how the End
   is connected with the Beginning; and what the great Crisis really
   means.

   This is why the Third Vision in Heaven is so solemn in its
   anticipation; and this is why the Third Vision on Earth is so brief in
   its response.

                          The Third Vision "On Earth"

   E^3, chap. xi. -19.

   This is very brief; the briefest of all. But, in reality it is the
   longest of all, for it anticipates the end of the Book. Before entering
   upon the judgment of the seven Vials, an Episode is to be given (as we
   have already shown) in chaps. xii., xiii., xiv., xv. Hence, before
   giving this Episode, the sounding of the Trumpet and the Heavenly
   utterances are briefly acknowledged by signs which betoken the coming
   judgments, which are to be taken up later and fully described in chaps.
   xvi. to xx.

   xi. -19. And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and
   earthquake, and great hail.]     That we have here a Vision relating to
   the earth is clear; though it is not, and need not be, so stated; for
   it is manifest that the earthquake must refer to the earth, as must the
   hail also. Similar phenomena are mentioned as the consequences of
   heavenly visions and announcements. (See viii. 5; x. 3; xvi. 18; xix.
   6.)

   The concluding words of the Elders closely connect the seven Vials as
   being the fulfilment of their prophetic utterance in xi. 18, 19.

   The Temple is opened; so the opening of the Tabernacle in xv. 5 is the
   initiatory act of the seven Vials.

   "Thy wrath is come," the Elders say. "Pour out the seven Vials of the
   wrath of God," cries the voice from the Throne, in xv. 7; xvi. 1.

   The voices and hail, also, of xi. -19, correspond with the "voices" and
   "hail" which accompany the pouring forth of the seventh and last Vial
   in xvi. 17-21.

   But before the account of this seventh Trumpet is resumed and its
   details set forth, we have three more visions "in heaven" interposed by
   way of parenthesis (viz., the fourth, fifth, and sixth, together with
   the fourth and fifth Visions "on earth"). The sixth Vision "on earth"
   takes up this third Vision, which, till then, is held over to allow of
   other information being given, which is necessary to the understanding
   of it.

   Chapters xii. 1 to xv. 8 are, therefore, parenthetical as regards the
   actual sequence of the Judgment scenes.

                         The Fourth Vision "In Heaven"

   H^4, chap. xii. 1-12.
   A Great Sign.


   We now come, not only to the great central subject of the whole Book,
   but to the central pair of the seven Visions, and to the actual
   literary centre of the Book.

   All this shows us that we are on the threshold of an important part of
   Scripture which relates to the actual Revelation or Unveiling of the
   glorious Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   The whole section (chaps. xii.--) is not only Episodal in subject and
   Parenthetical in form, but is a good example of historical, or, rather,
   prophetic Hysterologia, [249] by which the events, though written down
   later, took place earlier than those which immediately precede in
   historical narration. That is to say, we have in chaps. xii.-- a
   prophetic record of events which will take place before chap. vi., and
   will lead up to, and run parallel with, what is recorded in chaps.
   vi.--

   Chaps. vi.-- thus give the exoteric (or outer) view of that portion of
   prophetic history; for the Beast and the False Prophet are on the earth
   all that time, as is clear from xi. 7, where the Beast that ascendeth
   out of the abyss made war against the Two Witnesses. But how he came to
   be on earth we have not yet been told. The course of the prophetic
   record is therefore suspended, while we are taken back to a point prior
   to chap. vi., and in chap. xii. are given the esoteric (or inner) view
   of the same period, and told of the causes which shall lead up to the
   revelation of the Beast and the False Prophet. Chap. xii. occupies much
   the same position with regard to chaps. xiii. to end; as chaps. iv. and
   v. do to chaps. vi.--

   First, the war takes place in heaven, and the Devil is cast out into
   the earth. Then "he" stands on the sand of the sea (xiii. 1 RV.), and
   John sees these two awful beings coming up -- the one from the sea, and
   the other from the earth. There is no record of their doings except in
   chap. xiii., and what may be gathered from the judgments directed
   against them and their followers recorded in chaps. vi.-- and other
   Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.

   The Structure shows that the Woman and the Dragon are the two great
   subjects of the Vision, the "Man-child" occupying only one verse (the
   sixth).

   H4, xii. 1-12.  The Fourth Vision "in Heaven."
   A Great Sign

   H^4 |     A | xii. 1-.  A great Sign in heaven.
                       B |     a | -1-5.  The Woman and the Dragon.
                                       b | 6.  The Woman's flight.
                                               c | 7-9.  The War in
   heaven.
               A | 10-12.  A loud Voice in heaven.


   With this structure should be compared that of the following scene "on
   Earth" (E^4), with which the part marked "W" (xii. 13-- 1-) exactly
   corresponds.

   xii. 1-. And a great sign was seen in heaven:]      Here, at length,
   for the first time in this Book, we have a "Sign." The word is (...)
   (semeion) a sign; not (...) (teras) wonder. [250] We are thus warned at
   the outset that we are not to take this literally, but to see in it a
   "sign" of something else. Thus does the Holy Spirit guide us as to what
   is literal and what is not. What it is that is signified by the Sign we
   must learn from the Scripture itself. If we are thus warned that we are
   to treat this as a "sign," we may assuredly gather that, when we are
   not so cautioned, we are not to treat the things in this Book as
   symbols, but as literal facts and events.

   It is not only a Sign, but it is "a great sign," as important in its
   significance as it was vast in its appearance. It represented something
   remarkable in itself and momentous in its teaching.

   The Sign itself is described in "a", verses -1-5. The following is the
   structure:--

   a, xii. 1-5.  The Woman and the Dragon.

   a |     d |     e | xii. 1-.  A great sign in heaven.
                           f | -1.  The Woman.
                                   g | 2.  The travail of the Woman.
            d |     e | 3-.  Another sign in heaven.
                           f | -3, 4-.  The Dragon.
                                   g | 5.  The travail of the Woman.


   xii. -1. A woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and
   upon her head a crown of twelve stars:]     This at once takes us back
   to Gen. xxxvii. It is the only scripture in the whole Bible where we
   have anything corresponding to this sign. There we read of Joseph
   (verse 9): "he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren,
   and said, Behold! I have dreamed a dream more; behold, the sun, and the
   moon, and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. And he told it to his
   father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto
   him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I, and thy
   mother, and thy brethren indeed come to bow ourselves to thee, to the
   earth" (Gen. xxxvii. 9, 10). Joseph thus saw a similar "Sign," and both
   he and his father Jacob understood it at once, and interpreted it
   correctly, as the sequel shows.

   Now, when we have such a scripture as this, why go out of our way to
   seek for another explanation outside scripture altogether. That the
   same twelve stars are referred to in Genesis is clear, because Joseph
   himself made the twelfth. Here we have the earliest reference to the
   twelve signs of the Zodiac. These are the only "twelve stars," or
   asterisms, in the heavens. There are the "seven stars" meaning the
   seven planets; but the twelve stars can mean only the twelve signs (or
   stars) of the Zodiac, thus embracing the whole heavens.

   The heathen nations, being ignorant of the written word of God, did not
   know the primitive truth preserved by the Antediluvian Patriarchs in
   the signs and constellations of the heavens before it was written down
   by God through Moses in "the scriptures of truth." Hence, the nations
   preverted it, and overlaid it with their own vain imaginations. This
   was the origin of the old Greek mythology; and before that, of the
   various ancient mythologies of Babylon and other nations. Those
   mythologies were not invented by those nations, but they were the
   corruption of primitive truth after that truth had been forgotten.

   As Rom. i, 20, 21 declares, they were "without excuse," for the
   invisible things of God were clearly seen and understood by the things
   that are made. They heavens declared His glory and spoke of His
   purposes. This is what Rom. i. 19-23 refers to.

   The Patriarchs had, long before the times of Jacob and Joseph, so
   mapped out the heavens, as to preserve the great foundation promise and
   prophecy of Gen. iii. 15, by making arbitrary configurations of the
   stars.

   That this is no mere conjecture is shown by an important article in The
   Nineteenth Century magazine (for Sep., 1900), by Mr. E.W. Maunder, of
   the Greenwich Observatory, on "The Oldest Picture Book of all." He
   says: "There are some indications, which seem to have escaped notice
   hitherto, by which we may fix, roughly at least, the date of certain
   other constellations than those of the extreme South. These are the
   twelve commonly known as the Signs of the Zodiac, and which, beyond all
   controversy, were planned in order to mark out the Ecliptic. The
   division of the Zodiac into twelve signs in one of very great
   significance... Now this perhaps was the most difficult discovery which
   up to the present date has yet been made in Astronomy."

   "The interdependence of so many of the designs, and the fact that the
   sphere is thus manifestly the work of a single authority, furnish
   reasons for thinking that it was intended to be of the nature of a
   document. An examination of the individual forms supports this
   conclusion." ... Again, he says: "We are sure that the Zodiac is not
   later than 1800 B.C., and does not date further back than 4400 B.C."

   He sums up the article by saying that "this oldest picture book of all
   was designed nearly 5,000 years ago" and that "Many of the
   constellations, then, were mapped out to express the religious belief
   of their designers. No doubt the others, of which at present we have no
   explanation, had just the same purpose.

   Mr. Maunder says also that the religion of those who designed the
   Zodiac and mapped out the Constellations "involved the erection of
   altars and the rite of sacrifice. They were acquainted with the stories
   of the Fall and the Deluge, substantially the same as those preserved
   to us in the early chapters of Geneses, and they devised many of the
   constellations to give appropriate and permanent record of them."

   The italics are our own, and the parts thus marked confirm our
   conclusions, on the highest authority; while the date assigned places
   its origins far beyond the domain of heathen mythology, and throws
   great light on Psalm xix.

   All readers of that Psalm are struck with the fact that the first part
   is about the Heavens, and that then, in verse 7, there is a sudden and
   abrupt transition to the written Word.

   This is explained by the fact that the reference is, in the first part,
   to the primitive truth witnessed to by the Sun and Stars in the heavens
   (an expansion of Gen. i. 14, 15); and in the second part the reference
   is to the written Word of God recorded in "the Scriptures of Truth."

   For some 2,000 years before Moses, the heavens declared the glory of
   God; and not only showed His handiwork, but from day to day uttered
   speech, and from night to night showed knowledge.

   True, there was no speech nor language; their voice was not heard; and
   yet, their "line" (i.e., their inheritance, [251] or sphere of
   teaching) is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end
   of the world. In them (i.e., in the heavens) hath He set a Tabernacle
   (or dwelling) for the Sun (i.e., the path of the sun through the signs
   of the Zodiac, called the "Ecliptic") which the sun never leaves, but
   goes forth from one end of the heaven to the other, performing his
   annual circuit. See the whole of Ps. xix. [252] But these "words," and
   this "knowledge," after they were written down in Scripture, naturally
   fell into disuse, and in time were forgotten; and afterwards were
   overlaid by the traditions of men. If Moses wrote by the time of the
   Exodus, this would give about 1491 B.C., for the date of the books of
   the Pentateuch, and thus leave mankind for some 2500 years without the
   Word of God written. Thus, for all that long period, the Heavens would
   be showing their knowledge, and sending forth their words to the ends
   of the earth, and preserving the great primeval promise and prophecy of
   Gen. iii. 15 alive in the hearts of God's people; making known the
   Coming one who, though bruised in the heel, should finally crush the
   serpent's head.

   These twelve stars, therefore, were the Zodiacal signs, which are thus
   associated with Israel in the persons of Jacob, and the twelve
   Patriarchs. These constituted and represented the whole nation in
   embryo. Their presence here in Rev. xii. tells us that God is about to
   reveal His own truth, write folly on all devices of the heathen, expose
   their false use of His own handiwork; and, as He smote "the gods of
   Egypt" when He delivered Israel from thence (Jer. xliii. 12, 13; xlvi.
   20), so, when He is about to deliver Israel again, He will execute His
   judgment on the gods of the heathen, by showing that their perversions
   of His primal promise will not affect its fulfilment; but all their
   mythological gods shall be helpless and useless to deliver them out of
   His hand. [253]

   Again we ask, Why introduce the Church here? Alford says "the whole
   symbolism points to it." On the contrary, the only like symbol in the
   whole Bible connects this woman, thus arrayed, with Israel. What has
   the Church got to do with Gen. xxxvii.? Are we to look for the Church
   there? If not, then why look for it here, in Rev. xii. Jacob, his wife
   and his twelve sons, may well be taken as a most fitting interpretation
   of the sign of the sun, moon and twelve stars: but the Church has no
   connection whatsoever with these.

   Further, Israel is again and again compared to a woman, and a married
   woman, in the Old Testament (Is. liv., etc.). Also, in her time of
   rejection, to a widow (Is. xlvii. Lam. i. 1. Luke xviii.); and a
   divorced woman (Is. l. Jer. iii.); but not so the Church. Nor can what
   follows be anywhere properly understood of the Church.

   xii. 2. And being with child she crieth out, [254] being in travail,
   and being in pain to bring forth]     When could this ever be spoken of
   the Church? What is the Church's travail? And what is the man-child
   which the Church brings forth?

   On the other hand, this "sign" exactly expresses the position and
   condition of the true Israel all through the history of the nation.

   The promise of Gen. iii. 15, as to the coming "seed" of the woman to
   crush the head of the great Dragon, was fundamental to the ground of
   Israel's faith.

   This chapter, therefore, takes us back to the beginning of evil wrought
   by Satan, and carries us right forward to the great crises of human
   history. It shows how "the mystery of God" and "the mystery of
   Iniquity" will be finished; and take some 6,000 years to work out.

   The birth of that "seed" became, therefore, the object of Israel's
   hope; the subject of Israel's prophets; and the "joy" of Israel's
   mothers when a man was born into the world (John xvi. 21).

   The "sign" of the travailing woman, and her being in pain to be
   delivered, signifies the expectant attitude of Israel -- de jure, if
   not de facto. The promised seed was meant to be the one great hope of
   the nation; to which everything pointed and of which everything
   testified.

   The first sign of the Zodiac was a permanent and constant reminder of
   this great primeval promise and prophecy.

   VIRGO is always represented, in all the ancient Zodiacs, with a branch
   in her right hand. That branch has come down to us, with the name of
   the star, which is of the first magnitude, Tzemech. This is the Hebrew
   (...), which means "branch," and is used of Christ, the promised seed,
   in Jer. xxiii. 5, 6 (signifying the "King," of Matthew); in Zech. iii.
   8 (signifying the "Servant," of Mark); in Zech. vi. 12 (signifying the
   "Man," of Luke); and in Isa. iv. 2 (signifying the "Lord," or Jehovah,
   of John). As these prophecies of the coming seed, under the name of
   "the Branch," were read in the Scripture, it would be impossible not to
   connect them with this first great "sign" of the Zodiac. And until
   those Scriptures were written, this sign in the heavens told of the
   coming seed, "the Branch of Jehovah."

   Of the great Creator it is written (Ps. cxlvii. 4, RV.):

   "HE telleth the number of the stars,
    HE giveth them all their names."

   And this name Tzemech is inseparably connected with the Divine
   omniscience of Him who created and named the stars; and gave and
   fulfilled the promise.

   In like manner the constellation of "THE WOMAN AND CHILD" was set as
   the first of the three constellations which are assigned to the sign
   "Virgo." [255] It is found in the most ancient Zodiacs, notably that
   from the Temple of Denderah, in Egypt. It dates from at least 2,000
   B.C., and may be seen to-day at the Louvre, in Paris (whither it was
   taken in 1821). The Hebrew name of this constellation of "the woman and
   child" was called Koman, which means the desired or longed for. It is
   from the Hebrew (...) (kahmah) to desire, which occurs only in Ps.
   lxiii. 1: "My flesh longeth for Thee." It is akin to (...) (chamad) to
   desire (Ps. xix. 10. Isa. liii. 2. Hag. ii. 7, &c.). We have the word
   komah used by the Holy Spirit in this very connection in Hag. ii. 7:
   "The DESIRE of all nations shall come."

   "The woman and child" was, therefore, part of the primeval truth
   revealed to man as a sign of Him who was to be the object of this
   desire.

   That it was ancient is testified by Albumazar (or Abu Masher, an
   Arabian astronomer, who wrote in the eighth century. [256] He says:
   "There arises in the first Decan [257] (as the Persians, Chaldeans, and
   Egyptians, and the two Hermes and Ascalius teach), a young woman, whose
   Persian name is ADRENEDEFA, a pure and immaculate virgin, holding in
   the hand two ears of corn, sitting on a throne, nourishing an infant in
   the act of feeding him, who was a Hebrew name (the boy, I say), by some
   nations called IHESU, with the signification IEZA, which we in Greek
   call CHRISTOS."

   This is, as we have said, the testimony of the ancient Zodiacs;
   otherwise this constellation was altered and corrupted in the third
   century B.C. by Conon, an astronomer of Alexandria (B.C. 283-222).
   [258] Even Shakespeare refers to "the good boy in Virgo's lap." [259]
   So that the fact has not been lost, though the name of the
   constellation has been changed.

   But long before the constellation had been changed, its real
   signification had been lost and perverted.

   Naturally, when the promises and prophecies had been written down in
   the Scriptures of Truth, the meaning of the signs and constellations,
   and the very names by which God had called the stars, would fall into
   disuetude and became gradually forgotten. This would lead to the easy
   perversion of their meaning by those nations who did not possess the
   Word of God. Hence this constellation of the "woman and child" passed
   into the Babylonian and Egyptian mysteries under the names of "Isis and
   Horus"; and thence, from the pagan mysteries, the picture passed into
   Romanism, with many other symbols and doctrines. [260]

   Indeed, so closely is Romanism allied to Paganism, of which it is the
   outcome, that those who do not see the difference between Paganized
   Christianity and Bible Christianity, draw the false conclusion that
   Romanism is merely a corruption of Christianity, whereas it is little
   more than Christianised Paganism.

   Hence it was that, the real meaning of "the woman and child" having
   been lost, the symbol was Paganized, and we are told that
   representations of it as being "Isis and Horus" were so common (long
   prior to Christianity), that "there was not a house or a crossway where
   it was not found."

   Many of these Pagan symbols, rites, and ceremonies were brought into
   "Christianity" by the Greek Fathers, who were converts from Paganism,
   and had not lost their teaching and training.

   What we have here, therefore, in Rev. xii. is the fact that God is
   going right back to the beginning, and in spite of all the opposition
   of Satan and the perversion of Primitive Truth by Paganism, He is
   showing us His purpose in this closing book of Inspiration, which is to
   take us back to the causes of the great Apostacy, and onward through
   the great Apostacy, which is close upon us, to its final confusion and
   destruction.

   This is why we have, here, His vindication of those "Signs" by which He
   first promulgated His great primeval promise, and His own Revelation as
   to its final accomplishment in the crushing of the serpent's head.

   It is clear, so far, that the woman is the "sign" of Israel, viewed as
   representing the nation as a whole. Israel is thus personified, with
   the marks which characterise the nation in its constitution and in its
   hope.

   Having thus given the great "sign" of the "woman," we next have
   "another sign in heaven" -- the woman's enemy.

   xii. 3. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great red
   dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven
   diadems.]      This "sign" also is seen "in heaven," and we are not
   left in any doubt as to what it signifies. Verse 9 explains to us that
   "the great red dragon" is "that old serpent called the Devil
   (Slanderer) and Satan (Adversary)." He has seven heads and ten horns,
   and upon his heads seven diadems. These are the "signs" of the
   universality of earthly dominion: for Satan is the "prince of the power
   of the air" (Eph. ii. 2), "the prince of this world" (John xii. 31;
   xiv. 30; xvi. 11). As such, the Lord did not dispute his claim (Luke
   iv. 5-7). His colour is the colour of fire, and of blood. This is a
   "sign" of his cruelty and blood-thirstiness (John viii. 44. 1 John iii.
   12), and of the war which he makes "in heaven" and "on earth." The
   heads and horns and crowns are manifestly the "sign" of earthly power,
   gathered up in himself: for to whomsoever he will he gives or delegates
   it (Luke iv. 6, 7; chap. xiii. 2). Thus briefly is the authority and
   power of the woman's enemy set before us.

   xii. 4. And his tail draggeth down the third part of the stars of
   heaven, and he cast them to the earth:]     Here we have further
   details concerning this "sign." The "woman," as we have seen, is the
   "sign" of the Jewish nation as a whole; and the object and action of
   the Devil could not be more clearly stated.

   We are again taken back to the beginning of things; even to Satan's
   first rebellion, and to the angels who fell with him. This is surely
   the "sign" of Satan's power among the angels; as the heads and horns
   are a "sign" of his power among men on the earth. It seems clear from
   this that the third part of angels followed him in his great rebellion.

   and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to bring forth,
   that when she should bring forth he might devour her child]      Here
   we have a sign indeed; far beyond any mere passing event; or, even far
   beyond what Alford suggests, "the whole course of hostility against the
   Lord during His humiliation."

   We believe it goes much further back than this. These two Signs take us
   back to events which date "from the foundation of the world"; [261] and
   do not go beyond the question of the Government of the Earth, which the
   Dragon has usurped since the creation of man.

   The verb is "stands," not "stood." It refers to a continuous act, and
   not to a mere passing event.

   The moment the word went forth that the seed of the woman should one
   day finally crush the serpent's head, that old serpent, the Devil and
   Satan, took his stand before the woman in order to destroy her seed as
   soon as it should be brought forth.

   Satan's object, from the going forth of that prophecy, was to prevent
   that "seed of the woman" from ever coming into the world. He does not
   mean to be crushed if he can prevent it, and hence it is that, just was
   we are about to be told of the serpent's doom and how it is brought
   about, we are thus reminded of the fact, and told how he took his stand
   so as to prevent His coming at all; or to bruise His heel, if He should
   come.

   He has used, of course, various instruments and agents, and while these
   have had their own respective objects and motives, Satan's object has
   been one -- and one only -- and this has formed


   THE GREAT CONFLICT OF THE AGES.

   We see the first great attempt in Gen. vi. 2, when Satan strove to
   corrupt the whole of mankind. He succeeded so far, that only one family
   was uncontaminated. That is the meaning of the "perfect in his
   generation" in Gen. vi. 9. (...) (tahmim) means without blemish,
   especially as to pure descent, or blood (Ex. xii. 5; xxix. 1, etc.). It
   refers to genital perfection. [262] So vast was the corruption from the
   irruption of evil angels (2 Pet. ii. 4-7. Jude 6-8), that the whole
   race had to be destroyed. Noah and his three sons were alone pure from
   the awful defilement. [263]

   Nothing but Divine interposition saved the race and reserved mankind
   from a total overthrow. In Hem, the line of the "the seed of the woman"
   was continued, and the promise of Eden was preserved.

   The second great attempt was made in Exod. i. to destroy the male
   children of Israel at their birth. Pharaoh's object was to prevent the
   increase of the people, so that they might not get up out of Egypt.
   Satan's object was to destroy the male line altogether, and thus make
   the birth of "the seed of the woman" impossible.

   Again Divine interposition defeated Satan's plans. It was a spiritual
   conflict in which Heaven and Hell were taking part all along. It is the
   same conflict which we see here in Rev. xii. But it is written, "He
   taketh the wise in their own craftiness" (Job v. 13), and what Pharaoh
   had said with Egypt's "wisdom" (Ex. i. 10) was frustrated by a baby's
   tear (Ex. ii. 6): for when Pharaoh's daughter opened the ark of
   bulrushes, "she saw the child, and behold the babe wept. And she had
   compassion on him." Thus, Pharaoh's wisdom was made to end in having to
   board, lodge, bring up, and educate the very man who accomplished the
   very object Pharaoh had striven to prevent; for Moses delivered the
   nation out of his hand, and God overthrew his armies in the Red Sea.

   We see another very special and determined attempt of Satan to break up
   the Royal Line, by which the seed of the woman was to come, in 2 Chron.
   xxi., xxii.

   On the death of Jehoshaphat, his son Jehoram, made a beginning (to
   serve his own purposes, of course). He "slew all his brethren with the
   sword" (2 Ch. xxi. 4). So the Royal Line was reduced to himself -- one
   life.

   But he had children; and of these, we read that the Arabians came up
   against Judah, and slew all his sons, "so that there was never a son
   left him, save Ahaziah, the youngest of his sons" (2 Chron. xxi. 17).
   Mark the emphasis put by the Holy Spirit on this solemn fact. That they
   were slain, is clear from 2 Chron. xxii. 1.

   Ahaziah was then the only lineal descendant of the Royal Line of the
   seed of the woman, through David, Abraham, and Shem. But Ahaziah had
   children. These, in their turn, were slain by Athaliah. She evidently
   left them all for dead, for it says (2 Chron. xxii. 10) she "destroyed
   all the seed royal of the house of Judah." That is what she meant to
   do, and would have done had not God again Divinely interposed and
   rescued the infant "from among the king's sons that were slain" (2
   Chron. xxii. 11). For six years all the hopes of God's people rested on
   that one life. All the faithfulness of God depended on the life of that
   one babe. While Jehosheba, the wife of the high priest, was hidden,
   with the child, in one of the chambers of the House of God, her
   husband, Jehoiada, was going about among the people testifying and
   saying, "Behold, the kings' son shall reign, as the Lord hath said, of
   the sons of David." That was the burden of the testimony -- the
   faithfulness of Jehovah. And nothing but the Divine interposition
   frustrated the designs of Satan (and the plans of Athaliah) from
   succeeding in cutting off the Line by which the seed of the woman was
   eventually to come into the world.

   In the book of Esther we see another attempt on the part of Satan to
   destroy the whole nation; and not merely the males, or the seed royal.
   He used Haman's pride as the secondary cause. But again a small thing
   was used to frustrate the design of "the Jews' enemy." A sleepless
   night: that was all; but it was enough (Est. vi. 1). And again Satan
   was defeated.

   But he still "stood before the woman ready to devour her child as soon
   as it should be born." And at length the hour came when the seed of the
   woman entered into the world.

   Herod was used this time; and having ascertained the place (Bethlehem)
   from the Scribes (Matt. ii. 4), and the time when the star appeared
   from the wise men (Matt. ii. 7), he slew all the babes in Bethlehem
   under two years of age, and thought he had devoured the seed of the
   woman. But again Heaven interfered and defeated his plans.

   The suggestion of Satan that Christ should throw Himself down from the
   pinnacle of the Temple (Matt. iv. 6); the attempt of the people of
   Nazareth to cast Him down from the brow of the hill (Luke iv. 29); the
   two storms on the Lake (Matt. viii. 24 and Mark iv. 37; Luke viii. 23),
   were all so many attempts of Satan to devour this man-child. And when
   he saw Him on the cross, and laid in the sepulchre, and the stone
   sealed, and the watch set, he thought he had his prey within his grasp.
   But again Heaven interfered. "God raised Him from the dead," and the
   child was "caught up to God and His throne" (Rev. iii. 21). But we are
   anticipating.

   xii. 5. And she brought forth a son, a male (i.e., a man-child), who is
   about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron:] The word rendered
   male is (...) [264] (arsen), and is the neuter gender. It is therefore
   of no sex, and is most appropriate here. It is He of whom it is
   specially prophesied that He should rule the nations with a rod of
   iron. Ps. ii. 9.

   And her child was caught away to God, and to [265] his throne.]
   This, again, is emphatically true of Christ (see Rev. iii. 21). But it
   is not true of the Church of God. We are to be "called on high" by a
   special calling; and our bodies made "like unto His most glorious body"
   (Phil. iii. 14, 20, 21).

   Moreover, this calling will be all at once; and not "born." Each member
   of the Body of Christ is created, and is "a new creation in Christ
   Jesus."

   It seems a pity, almost, to have our minds disturbed by alluding to
   other common interpretations; but it is well for our readers to have
   the opportunity of judging for themselves, and of seeing the vagaries
   of expositors. We are asked to believe, for example, that the man-child
   is "a baptized Emperor, the son of Christ's faithful [!] church,
   elevated to the whole Empire, to an avowedly Christian throne"
   (Elliott).

   Adam Clarke affirms that it is "the dynasty of Christian Emperors,
   beginning with Constantine." Some see "the Valenses and Albigenses as
   sequestered from the pure worshippers generally." Others believe it is
   "the Nicene Creed"!

   We thus see what come of not "rightly dividing the word of truth"; and
   of interpreting of one dispensation that which properly relates to
   quite another.

   This is the end of the second sign, and there is a break in the
   continuity.

   xii. 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place
   prepared [266] there [267] by God, that there they should nourish her a
   thousand two hundred and sixty days.]     This is said by way of
   anticipation: for the war in heaven occurs before the flight of the
   woman, and, indeed, leads to that flight. This flight, therefore, is
   consequent on the war, and not on the catching up of the child to God
   and His throne. This is clear from verse 14.


   c., xii. 7-9. The War in Heaven.

   xii. 7. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth
   to war with [268] the dragon; and the dragon warred and his
   angels,]     The various reading here is abundantly attested by the
   best codices, and cannot be rendered as in the AV. Tregelles renders it
   baldly, "Michael and his angels to war." We have supplied the word
   "going forth," as in RV. This is absolutely necessary to make English.
   This reveals the fact that the initiative will be taken by Michael, and
   not by the Dragon: a very important point in the interpretation. The
   time has come in the Divine counsels for this great event of the ages.
   Satan, who has hitherto had access to the heavens is at length to be
   cast out.

   We are not to think of Heaven as consisting of one place. The word is
   so often used in the plural, that, though we are not free to adopt the
   teachings of Jewish tradition, yet we are to think of many (it may be)
   different spheres. As the heavens are "higher than the earth," so we
   may look on them as being larger than the earth. And as the earth is
   divided into various countries and states, so may heaven have its
   various divisions. In one of them these mighty spiritual forces set
   themselves in battle array.

   On the one side we have Michael, who is elsewhere described as "one of
   the chief princes" (Dan. x. 13); "your prince," i.e., of Israel (Dan.
   x. 21); "the great prince which standeth for thy (Daniel's) people"
   (Dan. xii. 1); "the archangel" (Jude 9). He it is, with his heavenly
   hosts, who makes war against the dragon, and not the dragon who makes
   war against the man-child (as is so often stated). He does not do this
   at all, but makes war against the woman (verse 13); and that war is
   made on earth and not in heaven. So that the interpretation of this, as
   meaning Satan's opposing the rapture of the church, falls to the
   ground. The church will be removed long before these judgment scenes
   commence; and is therefore not to be looked for in any place in this
   chapter.

   On the other side we have the Beast of chaps. xiii. and xvii. In Daniel
   ii. we have these powers in their earthly, human, mortal, successive
   and historical form. But in Daniel vii. and in the Apocalypse, we have
   the superhuman revival and contemporaneous concentration of them in the
   Beast.

   The Dragon's dominion covers all the powers and governments of the
   world, which are here seen included in and controlled by one being --
   the Dragon. The sovereignty of the world is about to become the
   sovereignty of our Lord and of His Christ, as we have just heard it
   announced "in heaven" (xi. 15). We are here shown the source and the
   embodiment of his sovereignty. This is why the prophecy is suspended
   just at this point. It is in order to explain to us what this
   sovereignty is, whence it comes, and whither it goes. All is here
   gathered up into one head.

   In 2 Thess. ii. we find further information as to the rise of this
   final embodiment of Satanic power. There we are clearly told that the
   revelation of that awful being has an appointed season. He cannot arise
   before his time. We are told why and how this is. In Rev. xii. we have
   the events which lead up to that revelation, and in Rev. xiii. we have
   the actual manifestation of the Beast himself.

   2 Thess. ii. therefore forms an important link when studied in
   connection with Rev. xii. There we learn that the Beast could not be
   manifested on earth as long as he (masculine) now holdeth fast [269]
   [to his place in the heavenlies, Rev. xii. 7]. He will hold it fast
   until he be cast out. [270] This casting out is described in Rev. xii.,
   and we are here told exactly how it will take place, and what will be
   its causes and consequences. When Paul wrote, worldly power was then
   being used, and has all along been used by Satan for the accomplishment
   of his secret purposes; and it is still thus working, but here (in Rev.
   xii.) we see it come to a head, and Satan is about to openly manifest
   it. Meantime, "Ye know what (neut.) holdeth [271] him (the lawless one)
   fast, that he (the lawless one) may be revealed in his time." Paul
   could write thus to the church of the Thessalonians, for he had
   previously told them and they knew; but we do not know. All we know is
   that it cannot be a person who holds the lawless one fast, for the word
   is in the neuter gender. It can only be a place, and we suggest that it
   is (...) (to phrear) the pit of the Abyss, Rev. ix. 2, out of which he
   is to ascend. In any case, the popular view cannot be correct, which
   takes it of the Holy Spirit. What does the Holy Spirit "hold fast" (1
   Thess. v. 21) in order that the lawless one may be revealed in his
   appointed time? This idea arose from a wrong translation of the verb
   (...) (katecho), which means to hold something fast.

   We have given all the occurrences of this word in a note on the
   previous page, so that our readers can judge for themselves. That wrong
   translation of both the AV. and RV. arises from ignoring the fact that
   the verb is transitive, and must have an object. Something must be held
   fast. Further confusion is also introduced by not preserving the
   important difference between the genders, which is neuter in verse 6
   ("THAT which holds him fast"), i.e., the Pit of the Abyss; and
   masculine in verse 7 ("HE who holds something fast," i.e., his position
   in the heavenlies, etc.

   Having regard to these four facts--

   (1) The meaning and usage of the verb;
   (2) The fact that it is transitive;
   (3) The distinction between the two genders in verses 6, 7; and
   (4) The undoubted idiom in verse 7 -- cast out, it is clear that 2
   Thess. ii. 6, 7 has suffered much at the hands of translators, and
   needs to be entirely recast.

   At the first advent the announcement was made "on earth, peace." But
   now, at the time of the Second Advent, it is "in heaven, war"; for the
   Dispensations have changed.

   At the return of the remnant from Babylon, Satan was present to resist
   the restoration of the Nation (Zech. iii. 2), and was rebuked. So it
   will be again when the great restoration is about to take place: but
   war will be declared against him.

   The mystery connected with this conflict is easy to faith, though hard
   for reason. A little insight is given into these spiritual realities in
   such passages as Job i. and ii. 1 Kings xxii. 19-22. Eph. vi. 11, 12.
   Jude 6.

   Milton has described this war, but he only drew on his imagination,
   which was limited by earthly battlefields. This war is wholly different
   in its occasion, its scenes, its combatants, and its weapons. This war
   has its foreknown and therefore its foretold ending.

   xii. 8. And they prevailed not; nor was even their place found any more
   in heaven.]      The great object with which that war is waged will be
   accomplished.

   9. And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent; who is called
   the Devil, and Satan, he who deceiveth the whole world: he was cast
   down unto the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.]     There
   can be no doubt as to whom this "sign" refers. By four names is he
   defined, so that we might make no mistake. And yet, it will hardly be
   believed that, in spite of this, there are interpreters who maintain
   that it means the "Pagan Roman Empire," and Michael is the "Christian
   Roman Empire." There are others who understand it of no real war at
   all, but only a prolonged antagonism between good and evil. How
   refreshing to come back to the Word of God, and believe that we have
   there the climax which the Lord Jesus, looking forward to the result of
   His "sufferings," in "the glory" that should follow, already foresaw
   with His spiritual prophetic vision in Luke x. 18, and said: "I beheld
   Satan as lightning fall from heaven."


   A., xii. 10-12. The Loud Voice in Heaven.

   Each of these visions seen in heaven are marked by heavenly voices and
   utterances. We have one in this Vision. The Structure is as beautiful
   as it is simple. The subjects of the utterance are two:

   (1) Rejoicing in heaven;
   (2) Woe to the earth;

   and between them there is a call for universal rejoicing.

   A, xii. 10-12.  The Loud Voice in Heaven.

   A |     h |     k | 10-.  Rejoicing in heaven.
                               l | -10, 11.  Reasons.
                                       i | 12-.  Call to rejoice.
             h |     k | -12-.  Woe to the earth.
                               l | -12.  Reason.


   xii. 10. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, [272]

   "Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God,
   and the authority of His Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is
   cast down, who accused them before our God day and night. (11) And they
   overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word
   of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death. (12)
   Therefore Rejoice, ye heavens, and ye who dwell in them. Woe to [273]
   the earth and to the sea! because the devil is come down to you, having
   great fury, knowing that he hath but a short season."]

   This is the song of victory sung in heaven. It will be sung by those
   who will have been caught up to heaven out of "the great Tribulation."
   (Ch. vii., xiv., xv.) For they speak of "our brethren." "Now is come"
   is the shout of triumph which celebrates, by anticipation, the results
   of Satan's being cast out of heaven. This is the first step arising out
   of Heaven's declaration of war. The emphasis is on the pronoun "they,"
   in verse 11, for they who overcame on earth now call on all heaven to
   rejoice over the wondrous victory. When the fruits of this heavenly
   victory are fully reaped on earth, then there will be others to call
   for the new songs, which are already written down for the singers in
   Ps. xciii.--, xcviii., cxlix. This call to rejoice finds its echo in
   the final song of triumph in Rev. xix. But all is traced up to and
   grounded on the infinite merits of "the blood of the Lamb": and the
   wonderous efficacy of His atonement.

   Again, we see that the Church cannot be here, for no one can accuse the
   Church before God. See Rom. viii. 33.

   We shall be indeed surprised if our readers are able to see, as the
   cause of that heavenly outburst of joy, the mere "casting down of
   paganism from the throne of the Roman Empire."

   The result of that was blessing to the world.

   The result of this is "woe to the earth." (verse 12)!

   But such a difference as this does not count with the expositors of
   this Book. Nor does the fact that the result of that conflict has gone
   on for centuries, in which the whole Reformation period is included;
   while this is to last for a very brief period -- one of many great
   events occurring in the last 3 1/2 years.

   When Satan is cast down, "he hath but a short time," which is
   definitely stated to be 3 1/2 years, during which he is wroth with the
   woman, and makes war with the remnant of her seed (xii. 14-17).

   This "Woe" is the last of a series of three (viii. 13); and must,
   therefore, be subsequent to the first two, which at this stage will
   have passed (xi. 14). The third is proclaimed in chap. xii. 12, and
   consists of the casting out of Satan.

   This conclusively shows that, though the Vision of ch. xii. is
   anticipative, the actual casting out cannot take place till the middle
   of the last of the seventy weeks (Dan. ix. 27). The Beast will be
   reigning on the earth during the first half of this week (Rev. vi. --
   xi.); but, in his human and mortal form; and acting "peaceably" (Dan.
   xi. 21). But now, in the middle of the week, the crisis or "Third Woe"
   comes (xii. 12). Satan is cast out. The Beast, having received his
   "deadly wound," reappears in his superhuman form, and "makes war with
   the saints" (xiii. 7). This last half of the week is "the great and
   terrible day of the Lord." But this brings us to the next, the Fourth
   Vision "on Earth" (xii. 13 -- xiii. 18).

   [255] Each sign had three constellations assigned to it, which further
   developed the central truth signified by the respective signs of the
   Zodiac.

   [256] A Latin translation of his Arabic work is in the British Museum
   Library.

   [257] The constellations were called Decans. The word means a part, and
   is used of the (three) parts into which each sign is divided; each of
   which parts, or Decans, is occupied by a constellation.

   [258] It appears that Berenice, the wife of Euergetes (Ptolemy III.),
   king of Egypt, made a vow that, if her husband returned in safety from
   a dangerous expedition on which he had gone, she would consecrate her
   wonderful head of hair to Venus. He did return in safety, and her hair
   was deposited in the Temple of Venus. Subsequently it was stolen, and
   Conon, to console her, gave it out that Jupiter had taken it and made a
   constellation of it. The similarity of the Greek word (...) (kome)
   hair, and the Hebrew koma facilitated the change (if it did not suggest
   it). And so it came to pass that in our Planispheres to-day Coma
   Berenice (the hair of Berenice) figures in the place of the woman and
   child -- "the Desire of all nations."

   the fact remains that it was part of the name of Bacchus: and, the

   Judaeorum (Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews), originally formed the
   pagan symbol that by fire nature will be renewed in its entirety (Igne
   Natura Renovetur Integra). See The Rosicrucians: their Rites and

   concerns the church of God in its Head and members, and occurs three
   times (John xvii. 24. Eph. i. 4. 1 Peter i. 20), because it is an act
   of Deity, and flows from uninfluenced grace.

   [262] "generation" is not the same word rendered "generations" in the

                          The Fourth Vision "On Earth"

   E^4, xii. 13-- 18.

   THE RESULT "ON EARTH" OF THE "WAR IN HEAVEN."


   This Vision, as a whole, is occupied with the Result "on Earth" of the
   "war in heaven" (chap. xii.). It is two-fold: First, the effect is
   given as it concerns Israel, and then, the effect as it concerns the
   Earth as a whole; and all forming part of this parenthesis or Episode,
   which takes us back to the period before xi. 13, and shows us how the
   Beast came to be on the earth. It is he who makes war against the "Two
   Witnesses" (ch. xi.); and it is against him and his armies that the
   judgments and plagues of chaps. vi.-ix. are directed.

   Now, we are taken back to have these prior events further made known
   and explained to us. The Episode does not end till chap. xv. 8.

   The Structure of this fourth Vision "on Earth" is presented in two
   separate parts, because they concern two separate Peoples (Jew and
   Gentile), which are never "reckoned" together (Num. xxiii. 9). The two
   divisions are as follows:--

   E^4, xii. 13-xiii. 18.  The Fourth Vision "on Earth."
   The Result "on Earth" of the "War in Heaven."

   E^4 |     W | xii. 13-xiii. 1-.  The effect as regards Israel.
               X | xiii. -1-18.  The effect as regards the Earth.


   Dealing first with the former of these two divisions, we have to give
   its expansion. It will be seen that its Structure exactly corresponds
   with the preceding Vision "in heaven," (chap. xii. 1-12); the
   correspondence showing that both parts of chap. xii. refer to the same
   subject, viz., Israel. The following is the expansion of W:

   W, xii. 13-xiii. 1-.  The Result of the War "in Heaven" as regards
   Israel.

   W |     A | xii. 13-.  The Dragon cast unto the earth.
                       B |     a | -13.  The Dragon and the Woman.
                                           b | 14-16.  The Woman's flight.
                                                   c | 17.  War on the
   earth.
             A | xiii. 1-.  The Dragon standing on the sand of the sea.


   The Dragon, as soon as he is cast down into the earth, at once proceeds
   to make war with the Woman, and the remnant of her seed. He does this
   by bringing up the Beast in his superhuman form.

   xii. 13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he
   pursued (or persecuted) the woman which brought forth the man-child
   [274] (14) And there was given to the woman the [275] two wings of the
   great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, unto her place,
   where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from
   the face of the serpent.]      Thus the wilderness will, as of old,
   afford a refuge for Israel; for the coming Exodus is to be like the
   first. (See Isa. xi. 16. Ezek. xx. 35-38.) "There will I plead with you
   face to face, like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of
   the land of Egypt." These are significant words. And we have like words
   in Hosea ii. 14, 15, where we read that the valley of Achor (which was
   the first place on the road from the wilderness to Canaan, Josh. vii.
   26) shall prove "a door of hope."

   "Therefore, behold, I allure her,
   And bring her into the wilderness,
   And speak comfortably unto her.
   And I will give her her vineyards from thence,
   And the valley of Achor for a door of hope:
   And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth,
   And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt" (Hos. ii.
   14, 15, and see Ex. xv.).

   "The woman fled into the wilderness." So of old "it was told to the
   king of Egypt that the people fled (Ex. xiv. 5. Josh. xxiv. 6). That
   flight was literal. So will this be. And at that time such passages as
   Ps. xxxv. 1-5 and Lam. iv. 19, etc., will find their exhaustive
   fulfilment. They "shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger" (Zeph.
   ii. 3). The Lord Jesus spoke of this "flight" in Matt. xxiv. 15-28 and
   Mark xiii. 14-23. This flight is not the same as that which He spoke of
   in Luke xxi. 20-24, for that took place at the destruction of
   Jerusalem, long "before all these things" (Luke xxi. 12) which the Lord
   spoke of in Matthew and Mark.

   This "flight" is from Jerusalem and Judea, for this is the central
   point where the two witnesses had been slain; and the final testimony
   borne to the doings of the Beast. The woman (i.e., the nation) flies
   because of the persecution of the Dragon. If none might buy or sell
   save those who have the mark of the Beast, some miraculous sustinence
   must be provided. And God Himself will again "furnish a table in the
   wilderness." Of old, He fed them there. In Ex. xix. 4, He appeals to
   them and says: "Ye have seen... how I bare you on eagles' wings and
   brought you unto myself." And so again, in Deut. xxxii. 11, 12, in the
   song of Moses, he mentions the same form of Divine help. The eagles'
   wings are "a sign" which signifies the miraculous swiftness, by which
   the Divinely given help will come to them. They are no "Roman eagles"!
   It does not say eagles, but eagles' wings. The Roman eagles possessed
   no wings, and had themselves to be carried!

   Fleeing, first to the "mountains" and then on to the "wilderness,"
   there the people will be fed for three years and a half. The period is
   expressed exactly as in Dan. vii. 25 and xii. 7. And it has already
   been mentioned in this book in different forms (see chap. xi. 2, 3).

   xii. 15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman, water
   as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
   flood.]     At the first Exodus it was the sea through which she went
   into the wilderness with its forty-two stations. It is "a flood" which
   drives her into the wilderness for forty-two months. The delivering
   from the sea was miraculous; so will be the deliverance from this
   "flood." Why should not one be as literal as the other? Where is the
   difficulty? Observe, it does not say "like a flood," as in Jer. xlvi.
   7, 8. Nor does it say an army like water; but "water" like a river."
   The first is literal, and its likeness is given. It does not expand
   into a lake, but rushes forward like a "flood."

   16. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and
   swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.]     And
   why not? The sea helped the same woman when it swallowed up the armies
   of Pharaoh, and why should not the earth help the woman again by
   swallowing up the forces of Satan. It is to be again as it was at the
   Exodus. And it will be a time of earthquakes and great physical
   disturbances. (See Is. xi. 15, 16).

   In Isa. lix. 19, we read of the enemy coming in like "a flood," just
   before "the Redeemer shall come to Zion," and when Gentile times shall
   come to the full.

   The earth once opened to swallow the host of Dathan and Abiram (Num.
   xvi.); and so it is written: "According to the days of the coming up
   out of the land of Egypt, I will show unto him marvellous things" (Mic.
   vii. 15).

   17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with
   the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have (or
   keep) the testimony of Jesus. [276] ]       Being baffled in his
   attempts to destroy the seed of the woman, who has been, ere this,
   "caught away to God and His throne,"! he turns his forces against the
   remnant of her seed. The description of this remnant is given, and
   agrees with that spoken of in other parts of this book; and while the
   bulk of the nation is safe and nourished, a faithful remnant on earth
   is having war made against it. We have these two seeds in chap. vii.
   First, the 144,000 sealed for testimony in the earth; and, afterwards,
   the great multitude caught away to heaven. In the next chapter they are
   called "saints"; and we have the two bodies again, the former in xiii.
   15 and the latter in vi. 9.

   In the Textus Receptus the first sentence of the first verse of chap.
   xiii. is the concluding sentence of the twelfth chapter, but the AV.
   wrongly transposes it, and puts it as the first sentence in chap. xiii.
   The translators were doubtless misled by the wrong reading of the
   Textus Receptus, which has (...) (estathen) I stood, instead of (...)
   (estathe) he stood (i.e., the dragon). The RV. (agreeing with L.T.Tr.A.
   and WH.) has restored the sentence to its proper place, at the close of
   chap. xii. 17; and given the correct reading, "he stood," in accordance
   with all the critical Greek texts and oldest and best manuscripts.

   The structure shows that this must be right; as that sentence is
   necessary in order to balance the first sentence of xii. 13.

   It is the dragon who has been cast into the earth (A. xii. 13-); and it
   is the same dragon who stands on the sand of the sea (A. xiii. 1-).
   Foiled in his attempts to destroy the woman's seed, as he had been
   foiled in his assault on the woman herself, he is now seen by John
   standing on the sand of the sea, and from thence, as it were, calling
   up the first of the two Beasts from the Abyss to carry out his final
   plans. So this section ends with the words:

   And he stood upon the sand of the sea.]      i.e., upon the shore.
   Daniel saw this same "great sea" and the four winds of heaven striving
   upon it (Dan. vii. 2).

   Before proceeding to the second great division of this fourth Vision
   "on Earth," it may be well to read and study carefully Dan. vii. 7, 8,
   19-27, which treats of the manifestation of Satan's power in the two
   powers of chap. xiii. in their final superhuman form, and in their
   obsessed spirit characters.


   X., xiii. -1-18.
   The Result of the "War in Heaven" as regards the Earth at large.

   We have seen and considered the result of the "War in Heaven" as it
   concerns Israel. (W., xii. 13-17). We have now to consider its further
   effect as it concerns the Earth at large.

   This effect is twofold, inasmuch as it results in the rise of the Two
   Beasts:

   The one from the Sea (verses -1-10).
   The other from the Earth (verses 11-18).

   The description of these two -- the Beast and the False Prophet --
   occupies the whole of chap. xiii. The chapter is divided thus:--

   X. xiii. -1-18.  The Twofold Result as regards the Earth at large.

   X |     Y | xiii. -1-10.  The Beast from the Sea.
             Z | xiii. 11-18.  The Beast from the Earth.


   Y and Z are now to be expanded. They concern the last mighty form of
   Satanic re-incarnation.
           The one is Anti-Christ.
           Another is Anti-Spirit.
           The other is Anti-God.
   Thus completing the Infernal Trinity.

   These two (the Beast and the False Prophet) are described in seven
   particulars, and the two members marked Y and Z are arranged precisely
   in the same order. They are given in a corresponding Extended
   Parallelism, of which the last members of each are divided into two;
   these two being arranged as an Introversion -- h, i; i, h.

   The following is the Structure:--

   X. xiii. -1-18.  The Effect of the "War in Heaven."

   X |    Y |    a | -1-.  The Vision.  "And I saw" (...).
                        b | -1-.  The first Beast.
                            c | -1-.  His origin.  The Sea (...).
                                d | -1, 2.  His Description.
                                    e | -2.  His power (...) derived from
   the Dragon.
                                        f | 3-8.  His deeds.
                                            g |     h | 9.  The call to
   hear.  "Let him hear."
                                                           i | 10.  The
   lesson.  "Here is patience and faith."
            Z |    a | 11-.  The Vision.  "And I saw" (...).
                        b | -11-.  The second Beast.  The false prophet
   (xvi. 13; xix. 20).
                            c | -11-.  His origin.  The Earth (...).
                                d | -11.  His description.
                                    e | 12-.  His authority (...) derived
   from the first Beast.
                                        f | -12-17.  His deeds.
                                           g |            i | 18-.  The
   lesson.  "Here is wisdom."
                                                    h | -18.  The call to
   count.  "Let him count."

   This Structure is already so minute and exhaustive, that none of its
   members have (or need) any expansion. It completes the effect of the
   "war in heaven" so far as it regards the earth at large as distinct
   from Israel; and concludes the fourth Vision "on Earth."

   After the failure of Satan's attempt to destroy Israel (the woman's
   seed), John sees him standing on the sand, or shore of the sea, as
   though pondering over, weighing, and forming his future plans. And
   while thus occupied, John sees the outcome, in the Beast which rises
   (as though at Satan's call) out of the sea.

   The beasts of chap. iv. are (as we have seen) (...) (zoa), and are
   rendered by us as Zoa, and in the singular Zoon. This, is (...)
   (therion), a wild beast, or a beast of prey.

   The text supplies us with the Divine information given on this great
   subject.

   xiii. 1. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having ten horns
   and seven heads, [277] and upon his horns (gen.) ten diadems, and upon
   his heads (acc.)blasphemous names.]      This is the Beast in his
   superhuman stage. Already he has been on the Earth for 3 1/2 years, in
   his mortal stage. He then receives his death-wound mentioned below, in
   verse 3 (as the seventh head), and comes up out of the Abyss as the
   eighth king, comprising all the seven heads and the ten horns. These
   are, in their now superhuman form, crowned. In their mortal form they
   were not crowned. (See xvii. 12).

   It will be better to defer the interpretation of the heads and horns of
   this Beast until we come to chap. xvii., where we can consider it with
   greater advantage. The Holy Spirit has confined Himself here to an
   outline description, or brief statement, as to the general
   characteristics of these two Beasts; while in chap. xvii. He has
   explained them more fully.

   It will be well, therefore, for us to follow on these lines, and
   content ourselves now by the general statement that we have here
   something far beyond Rome, papal or pagan; something far beyond the
   "fourth Beast," or Roman Empire, as it is called. We have all the world
   powers, and all dominion in the earth, gathered up and concentrated in
   this one sign. We see them in their superhuman form, here in the
   Apocalypse, as we see them in their human or mortal form in Daniel. It
   is the whole Image of Dan. ii. in its superhuman form which we see
   here, rather than one of its mortal parts. IT IS THE IMAGE REVIVED AS A
   WHOLE. It reaches to "wheresoever the children of men dwell" (Dan. ii.
   38); it affects "all that dwell upon the earth" (Rev. xiii. 8; xi. 10;
   xiv. 6). When the time for these final judgments arrives the great
   stone falls. It smites the image upon the feet, it is true (Dan. ii.
   34); but it is immediately added, "Then was the iron, the clay, the
   brass, and the gold BROKEN TO PIECES TOGETHER" (Dan. ii. 35). [278]
   This is far more extended than the Roman Empire.

   It takes in the whole earth; in fact, all earthly power, and all
   worldly dominion, in its final consummation. Hence, all the heads and
   horns of the various successive powers are here combined and united in
   one, forming the embodiment of all political sovereignty on earth.
   There is to be no other during it existence; and there will be none but
   our Lord's and His Christ's after it is gone. In chap. xvii. we have
   them separately, and can so consider them when we come to that chapter.

   2. And the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet as
   the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the
   dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.]
   We are at a loss to understand how this can be the Roman Empire
   revived! For the Beast itself is like a leopard (Greece) (Dan. vii. 6).
   Its feet are those of the bear (Medo-Persia); and its mouth is like a
   lion's mouth (Babylon). Where is the Roman Empire here in any form? If
   the Beast be the Roman Empire, does he have himself, intact, for one of
   his own heads? The notion is only a venerable, but vain, imagination.
   Rome cannot be at the same time one of the heads, and yet the whole
   Beast himself. "One is" (xvii. 10). This is said to be the Roman
   Empire. But it is added, "the other is NOT." Is this the Roman Empire,
   too? Clearly, Not! What we have here is the embodiment and
   personification of the sovereignty of the world under Satanic power,
   for "the whole world lieth in (the power of) the wicked one."

   When we say personification, we must recognise the spirit-being from
   the Abyss (xvii. 8), i.e., the superhuman agent, through whom he works.
   As Satan delegates this special mission to the Beast (a
   superhuman-being), so does the Beast act through a human being by
   obsession, or in some other way. God, here, takes us behind the scenes
   and shows us the Satanic machinery by which the whole thing is
   operated. While the people on earth see only a man, -- "the Man" --
   they may know nothing of the power of the Abyss behind him, and out of
   which he comes.

   This is exactly what is foretold by our Lord, in the parable of the
   strong man (Matt. xii. 43-45), when He tells how the unclean spirit
   returns to his house whence he came out, and "taketh with himself seven
   other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell
   there: and the last state of that man is worse then the first. EVEN SO
   SHALL IT BE ALSO UNTO THIS WICKED GENERATION."

   This shows that the Lord is speaking a parable with regard to the
   nation of Israel; and what does it teach if it does not show us that
   there will be obsession by evil spirits acting through human agency;
   not only with regard to Israel, but with regard to the whole world.
   Doubtless, the human agent will have already been alive some time on
   earth, working up to this point, when Satan takes him in hand uses him
   henceforth for his own purposes; by rapid strides raising him to the
   pinnacle of earthly pride and power.

   The moment will come when a human being will be found who is willing to
   accept that which the Lord Jesus rejected in Luke iv. 6, 7, when the
   devil, having shown Him "all the kingdoms of the world," said unto Him:
   "All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them: for that is
   delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it. If, therefore,
   thou wilt worship me, all shall be thine." The Lord refused it, but he
   did not deny the truth of the words, or dispute Satan's authority or
   power. He merely says: "Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written,
   Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
   The whole question is one of worship, and it will never be settled till
   at last Satan finds one to worship him. In return, Satan will get for
   him, and give to him, the worship of the world.

   xiii. 3. And I saw [279] one of (lit., from among) his heads as it were
   slain to death; and his death-wound was healed: and the whole earth
   wondered and followed after the Beast.]      What is said of the Lamb
   in chap. v. 6, is here said of the Beast.

   It does not say which of the seven heads is thus characterised; or when
   the sword would was given; but the Beast is repeatedly spoken of as "he
   whose stroke of death was healed." It is this last or seventh head,
   this man himself who is killed and restored to life. The whole world
   wonders at him and follows after him, on account of this great satanic
   miracle worked on his behalf.

   This is the hour spoken of in iii. 10, "which is to come upon the
   world, to try them that dwell upon the earth." "Satan's throne" will
   then be set up in the earth (ii. 13; xvi. 10), and a man, "the lawless
   one," will occupy it, and take the sovereignty of the world, obsessed
   and energised by satanic power.

   xiii. 4. And they worshipped the dragon because [280] he gave the [281]
   (i.e., his)authority to the Beast; and they worshipped the beast,
   saying,

   "Who is like unto the Beast?
   And [282] who is able to make war with him?"]

   It is clear from this that everything is combined in this man to make
   him not only acceptable to the world, but to call forth their wonder,
   admiration and praise. He is not in any way a terror to men, but full
   of blandishments, attractions, allurements, and activities which will
   be all put forth in the interests of human greatness and happiness. It
   will be Satan's brief millennium, in which mankind will, by every art
   and artifice, be made happy. It will be a time of peace and progress
   for the whole world. Great secrets of nature will be discovered; evil
   angels will be the teachers, and deceiving demons the guides of
   mankind. Great inventions and discoveries will be made, and turned to
   the utmost possible account. Philanthropy will be the governing
   principle of the world and of the "Church." The great ethical revival
   is at our doors. Its advent is announced by the foremost preachers of
   the day. All this is preparing the way for the man of sin, and the
   lawless one, who shall be a law unto himself and unto the whole world.
   Men will delight in him, and regard him as the greatest benefactor the
   world has ever known. Kings will gladly owe him suzerainty; and behind
   all will be Satan himself, swaying the hearts, tongues and energies of
   thousands of willing agents.

   xiii. 5. And there was given to him a mouth speaking great blasphemous
   things (lit., "great things and blasphemies." The Figure is Hendiadys;
   for the great things are his blasphemies); and authority was given to
   him to act thus forty and two months. (6) And he opened his mouth in
   blasphemies [283] against God, to blaspheme his name, and his
   tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven]      This is the one great
   distinguishing mark of this wild Beast (see Dan. vii. 8, 11, 20; xi.
   36. Ps. lii.), and it identifies him with the former of the two
   described in 2 Thess. ii. If we place the words side by side, this will
   be at once seen:--

   Rev. xiii. 5, 6

   2 Thess. ii. 4

   "There was given to him a mouth speaking great blasphemous things...
   and he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His
   name, and His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven."

   "Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
   that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
   shewing himself that he is God."

   Is it not clear from this comparison that the same person is the
   subject of both? and that 2 Thess. ii. 4 relates to the same judgment
   scenes as Rev. xiii. 5, 6? Indeed, the connection is closer than this:
   for in each of these Scriptures the same two beings are referred to.
   This will be more clearly seen if we notice

   The Structure of 2 Thess. ii. 1-12 (in brief)

   A | ii. 1-3-.  Exhortation not to believe what the Apostle did not say.
               B | -3, 4.  Reason.  "For...
   A | ii. 5, 6.  Exhortation to believe what the Apostle did say.
               B | 7-12.  Reason.  "For...


   This may be set forth more fully as follows:

   The Structure of 2 Thess. ii. 1-12. (expanded).

   A | ii. 1-3.  Exhortation, etc.  Negative.
           B |     a | -3.  The Apostacy: (open).
                        b | -3.  The revelation of "the man of sin."  The
   Beast from the sea, of Rev. xiii. 1-10.
                            c | 4.  The character of his acts. (Compare
   with Rev. xiii. 6-8)
   A | ii. 5, 6.  Exhortation, etc.  Positive.
           B |     a | 7.  The Mystery or secret purposes of lawlessness.
                         b | 8.  The Revelation of "the lawless one." The
   Beast from the earth, of Rev. xiii. 11-18
                             c | 9-12.  The character of his acts.
   (Compare Rev. xiii. 13-15).

   The two Beasts thus stand out very clearly. We have compared the
   character of the first, and may leave that of the second till we come
   to consider it in its place, below, in this chapter.

   We are told, of this first wild beast, that his course will be limited
   in its duration. It will be as brief as it will be brilliant. Only for
   42 months will be the duration of his superhuman career. "In the midst
   of the week" (Dan. ix. 27) will he break his covenant which he will
   have made with Israel, and make war against the saints (commencing, as
   we have seen, with the Two Witnesses, xi. 7), and persecute the woman
   (xii. 13-17).

   It is during this time that the martyrs will be slain (vi. 9; xx. 4).

   xiii. 7. And it was given to him to make war with the saints (Dan. vii.
   21; viii. 12, 24; xi. 31. Rev. xi. 7), and overcome them: and there was
   given unto him authority over every tribe, and people, [284] and
   tongue, and nation.]     What do the great bulk of interpreters do with
   this when they teach that this is the Roman Empire revived within its
   old limits? It surely agrees with what we have said above as to this
   being the sovereignty of the world gathered into one head for "a little
   season" (x. 6; xii. 12; xvii. 10), and soon to become the sovereignty
   of our Lord and of His Christ (xi. 15).

   But although authority was given him over all, all will not at once
   submit to it. Hence this war is to compel men to worship him and
   receive his mark.

   8. And all who dwell upon the earth will worship him, each one whose
   [285] name [286] hath not been written from the foundation of the world
   in the book of life of the Lamb slain.]     There is nothing to show
   whether the sentence, "from the foundation of the world," should be
   connected with the verb "written," or "slain." We have rendered the
   words in the same order as the Greek, which looks as though it should
   be read with the word "written." Moses knew of this book (Ex. xxxii.
   32), and Daniel (xii. 1). Compare Is. iv. 3. But the latter connection
   is the most natural, and agrees with 1 Pet. i. 19, 20. The death of the
   Lamb was thus "foreordained before the foundation of the world"; while
   the names are written "from" the foundation of the world.

   "All who dwell upon the earth will worship him." Is this worship given
   to the superhuman individual who will thus exalt himself, or to the
   Roman Empire revived? Few, if any, will be so bold as to maintain the
   latter; and in this case the revival of that Empire, as such, so
   confidently taught, cannot be looked for.

   This worship of the Beast will be well-nigh universal. Even in the
   plain of Dura, only three out of all the Jews there present stood out
   true to God. But these days will be more terrible than those. See Matt.
   xxiv. 9-27. Flight is the only resource of the faithful (chap. xii.).

   xiii. 9. If any one hath an ear let him hear]     For the last time
   this appeal of the Son of Man goes forth. Assemblies are no longer in
   question. It has come down to individuals. The last of the
   Dispensations is about to end, hence this admonition is given for the
   last time.

   10. If any one is for the captivity, [287] into captivity he goeth: if
   any one is to be killed with the sword with the sword he is
   killed.]     The Greek Text of this verse is very confused, and there
   are many various readings. But the sense is perfectly clear. The Hebrew
   idiom was not understood by the transcribers of the MSS. and hence they
   tried to correct it. It is a Hebraism expressing destiny, and denoting
   a certainty of approaching judgment, from whichever side it comes. See
   Jer. xliii. 11: "And when he (Nebuchadnezzar) cometh, he shall smite
   the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death, to death; and
   such as are for captivity, to captivity; and such as are for the sword,
   to the sword." And Jer. xv. 2: "And if they say to thee, Whither shall
   we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord, such as
   are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword;
   and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for
   captivity, to captivity." See also Ezek. v. 2, 12 and Zech. xi. 9. From
   these passages it is abundantly clear that Rev. xiii. 10 means that so
   sure and certain will these judgments be which are executed by the
   Beast, that none will escape them. Hence the need for the admonition of
   verse 9 and the words which follow.

   Here is the patience (i.e., patient endurance) and the faith of the
   saints.]      These will be the three great requisites for those "times
   of trouble."

   Flight (Matt. xxiv. 15-28. Mk. xiii. 14-23. Rev. xii. 14);
   Patience (chap. i. 9; ii. 2, 19; iii. 3, 10; xiv. 9-12); and
   Faith (chap. ii. 10, 13, 19; xvii. 14).


   Z., chap. xiii. 11-18.
   The Second Beast: from the earth.

   The Second Wild Beast is distinguished from the first, twice in the
   twelfth verse, and elsewhere. As soon as he is mentioned, "the Beast"
   always means the first Beast, as being pre-eminent and predominant.

   xiii. 11. And I saw another Beast coming up out of the earth; and he
   had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.]      The second
   Beast, like the first, is superhuman, obsessed and energized by Satanic
   power. Three times he is called "the False Prophet" (xvi. 13; xix. 20;
   and xx. 10). He is also the great coadjutor of the first Beast, and his
   mission is to aid the first Beast by deceiving mankind. The Lord Jesus,
   in speaking of this great Tribulation, warned against False Prophets as
   well as against False Christs, and spoke of their great work and power
   to deceive (Matt. xxiv. 5, 11, 24. Mark xiii. 22). Here is "the False
   Prophet," and this is his proper title.

   He has two horns, and not ten, as the first Beast. The ten denote
   dominion; the two speak of testimony; in this case false testimony. He
   spake as a dragon, i.e., subtilely, craftily and deceitfully. (Compare
   Gen. iii. 1; xlix. 17. 2 Cor. xi. 3).

   And all these are used in behalf of the first Beast. The former is
   Political, the latter is Religious. The Dragon, the Beast and the False
   Prophet form the Devil's travesty of the Holy Trinity.

   It is infernal, as the other is Divine. The Dragon is the anti-God; the
   Beast is the anti-Christ; the False Prophet is the anti-Holy Ghost.

   The majority of interpreters know nothing between "the Church" on the
   one hand, and "Popery" on the other. The Jew is cut out of the
   Apocalypse and almost out of all prophecy. All that is good refers to
   the Church, and all that is evil to Papal Rome. So contracted is man's
   vision that his conceptions savour of a Village Club instead of the
   mighty crisis of the struggle for universal Sovereignty. Others see
   only the Greek Church, the French Republic, or the heathen priesthood.
   Most interpreters view the two Beasts as two aspects of the same thing.
   All seem to be agreed that they are not individuals; which is the very
   thing that the ordinary reader would at once take them to be. Little
   hope, therefore, can be expected from such guides.

   All the Scriptures which refer to these Beasts speak of them, without
   exception, as individuals. There is no hint as to their being anything
   else.

   But because we believe this False Prophet to be an individual, there is
   no necessity for singling out some dead man, such as Judas Iscariot!
   His sin was surely great enough, without adding all this on to it. The
   second Beast is a spirit-being, but it is a man who is obsessed by it.
   The man will not have two horns. To the world he will be seen as a man.
   To us, now and here, he is shown to be superhuman; and as immediately
   led, influenced and energized by special spirit-agency. Already, there
   are many who are tampering with Spiritism, and who have their "familiar
   spirits" and guides. Spiritists, themselves, are well aware of the
   dangers and evils of obsession. But presently there will be one who
   will be obsessed by this mighty spirit-agent of Satan. Acts xvi. 16-18,
   and xix. 15, 16 throw a little light upon it.

   Eight times is the expression "he causeth" used of this False Prophet
   [288] ; so that he is an efficient agent. What "he causeth" we are told
   in the verses which follow:

   xiii. 12. And he exerciseth all the authority of the first Beast before
   him (i.e., in his presence), causeth the earth and those who dwell
   therein that they shall worship [289] the first Beast, who was healed
   of his deadly wound.]      "The earth and they that dwell therein" is a
   figure of speech called Pleonasm, or redundancy; a Hebrew figure
   characteristic of this book. The sphere of activity of the first Beast
   will be Political; of the second it will be Ecclesiastical. The basis
   of the worship will be his miraculous resurrection. People are induced
   to pay him divine homage. The False Prophet reduces it to a system.
   There is nothing in all this that is beyond our faith. Such things have
   happened before; why not again? Herod received Divine homage and took
   it as his right (Acts xii. 21-23). History is full of similar examples,
   and can easily repeat itself. "New" Religions are in the air in our own
   day; and in each there is less and less of God. In the new religion
   that is coming, God will be entirely left out, and man exalted. It will
   be a combination of wisdom, science, progress, and philanthropy,
   combined with all that panders to the lowest instincts of fallen
   humanity. Given all this, plus Satanic and spirit-agency, and what is
   here described is easily possible, and what is more -- it is revealed
   as positively certain.

   xiii. 13. And he worketh great signs (i.e., miracles), so that he
   causeth even fire to come down out of heaven to the earth before
   men,]      That these are real miracles there can be no doubt, since
   that very same word is constantly used of the miracles wrought by
   Christ. And these miracles are "great." This again is no new thing.
   Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses (Ex. vii. 11. 2 Tim. iii. 8), and up
   to a certain point worked the same miracles. Elijah caused fire to come
   down out of heaven more than once (1 Kings xviii. 38. 2 Kings i. 10,
   12), and in this Book it is used by God as one of His judgments (xx.
   9). The two witnesses deal in like manner with their enemies (xi. 5).

   xiii. 14. And he deceiveth those who dwell on the earth by reason of
   the signs (miracles) which it was given him to work before the
   Beast:]      Here we have the very words, almost, used of this same
   second Beast in 2 Thess. ii. 9. We will place the two descriptions side
   by side (as we did with the first Beast) to show that the same person
   and work and time are referred to in both scriptures:--

   Rev. xiii. 13, 14

   2 Thess. ii. 9-11

   "And he worketh great signs, so that he causeth even fire to come down
   out of heaven to the earth before men.  And he deceiveth them that
   dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to
   work before the Beast."

   "Whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and
   signs and lying wonders; and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
   in them that perish... For this cause God shall send them strong
   delusion, that they should believe the lie."

   Here we have two accounts of the same being and his work. In 1 Tim. iv.
   1-3 we are told of the times coming on the earth when "deceiving
   spirits" (i.e., evil angels) should be teachers, and "teachings of
   demons" should be taught and received. We are in those days already,
   and these lying spirit-teachers are at their awful work. Demoniacal
   teachings are being received on every hand. Many professing Christians
   are dabbling with Spiritism; and even ministers are presiding at
   lectures where this abomination is being advocated. What it will come
   to ere long, we are told in these scriptures.

   Miracles are becoming common-place. And, strange as it may sound, they
   are, in themselves, no evidence whatever as to proof of a Divine
   Mission. We are aware that theology teaches the opposite; adopting the
   false premisses of Paley and his successors.

   Christ's miracles, as miracles, were no evidence of His Divine mission.
   The real evidence was that the miracles which He wrought were the very
   miracles which the Prophetic Word had declared He should work, and
   which were on that account the sign and seal of His ministry, and
   formed His credentials from on high. This is clear from Matt. xi. 1-6.
   It was not that they were mere miraculous acts, but that they were what
   God had foretold, and the essence of their testimony was to the truth
   of God's word, rather than the power of Christ. Hence it is that they
   are so generally called "signs," and not merely "wonders." They are not
   for the crowd to gape at, but for the Bible students to study and learn
   their Divine lessons and teaching as to the truth of God's word and the
   Divine mission of the Lord Jesus.

   Miracles and wonders, as such, have always been wrought; and will be
   wrought again by the Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet. And
   while the evidence furnished to the people by their miracles will be to
   the establishment of their false claims: to those who will keep the
   faith in those days, the evidence will be to the truth of God's Word,
   which has foretold these very miracles. Their miracles will establish
   their infernal origin and Satanic power, and not their Divine mission.

   Ordering those who dwell on the earth, to make an image to the Beast,
   who hath the sword-wound, and lived. (15) And it was given to him to
   give breathe to the image of the Beast, that the image of the Beast
   should speak, and cause also that as many as would not worship the
   image of the Beast should be killed.]      Again we ask, Why not? What
   has been can be again . On the plain of Dura (Dan. iii.) a similar
   scene was witnessed and a similar law enacted, so far as the worship
   and the penalty are concerned. How the speaking will be effected we do
   not know, but we know enough to see how easy the task is becoming.

   Nikola Tesla, the Hungarian-American electrician, boldly declares (in
   The Century magazine for June, 1900), that he has a plan for the
   construction of an automaton which shall have its "own mind," and be
   able, "independent of any operator, to perform a great variety of acts
   and operations as if it had intelligence." He speaks of it, not as a
   miracle, of course, but only as an invention which he "has now
   perfected." [290] But again we say we care not how it is going to be
   done. God's word declares that it will be done, and we believe it.
   "Human energy" is getting on, and it will, ere long, be superhuman when
   developed by the Satanic agency of the second Beast, exercised through
   the human False Prophet. We already hear of talking machines; with "a
   little" Satanic power thrown in, it will be a miracle very easily
   worked.

   This, and Tesla's idea for the "increase of human energy," is further
   described in The Daily Express (London) for June 12, 1900.

   In seven passages we read of "the image of the Beast" (xiii. 15; xiv.
   9, 11; xv. 2; xvi. 2; xix. 20; xx. 4).

   Psalms lxxiii. refers to those troublous and perplexing times, when the
   faithful are at their wits' ends, and desolation and destruction of the
   ungodly are described. In verse 20 it is added:

   "As a dream when one awaketh,
   So, O Lord, in the city ((...) bair), thou shalt tread down their
   Image."

   (...) (bair) means in the city, as in the P.B. version (Coverdale) and
   RV. margin; and (...) (bazah) means to tread down, tread under foot, as
   in Ps. xliv. 5. Isa. xiv. 19; lxiii. 18. So, when God awakes to
   judgment, He will tread down this Image, and cause it to vanish from
   the city as a dream vanisheth on awaking. The city is, of course,
   Jerusalem, where this abomination will be set up.

   xiii. 16. And he (i.e., the Second Beast) causeth all, even the small
   and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, to
   receive [291] a mark on their right hands, or upon their
   foreheads:]      Thus, out of Democracy comes Despotism: out of
   Liberalism comes "Boycotting" on a large scale: out of Reason comes
   Idolatry; out of Socialism comes the abrogation of the rights of "Free
   labour." What was thought impossible in this direction a few years ago
   is now seen to be an accomplished fact in all directions. In whole
   districts it is often forbidden to buy or sell either their merchandise
   or their labour; and none are exempted from this new enslavement. The
   False Prophet will bring "Boycotting" to perfection, and employ it as a
   political power and a religious agency. The object is

   xiii. 17. [292] That no one should be able to buy or sell, except he
   who has the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his
   name.]      The plan is truly Satanic in its wisdom: for each one
   becomes a spy on the other. Living will be made next to impossible:
   even money will be useless. The rich will be as the poor if they have
   not this mark. It will be far worse than famine.

   The word for "mark" is (...) (charagma) brand. In the Papyri, (...) is
   always connected with the Emperor, and sometimes contains his name and
   effigy, with the year of his reign. It was necessary for buying and
   selling. It is found on all sorts of documents, making them valid; and
   there are many on "bills of sale." Charagma is therefore the official
   seal; and this brand will be received by the great majority rather than
   suffer the torture of death from violence or privation.

   xiii. 18. Here is wisdom. He who hath understanding let him calculate
   the number of the Beast: for it is man's number; and its number is Six
   hundred and sixty-six.]      The words imply that the calculation is
   possible but difficult. The task is generally undertaken on the
   assumption that the problem is to be solved by Gematria; i.e., by
   reckoning (after the manner of the Hebrews and Greeks, who had not
   Arabic numerals) a letter as being put for the corresponding number for
   which it stood. But this is enumeration, not computation; and the vast
   number of names which have been thus formed forbid us either to
   increase the number, or to select from it. We believe the clue is to be
   found in the statement that it is "man's number."

   Now three is the Divine number. Seven is the number of the Spirit.
   Eight is the Dominical number, and so on. But Six (with its multiples)
   is peculiarly man's number. It is first mentioned in connection with
   man (for man was created on the sixth day). Six, therefore, is to man
   what the "hall-mark" is to silver. It is man's hall-mark; stamping
   everything which it is used in connection with as pertaining to man.
   The great defiers of God have been so stamped. Goliath was six cubits
   in height, his spear's head weighed six shekels, and he had six pieces
   of armour.

   Nebuchadnezzar's Image was sixty cubits in height, and six cubits wide;
   and six instruments of music summoned its worshippers.

   The number 666 has, moreover, another remarkable property. It is marked
   by the triple concentration or essence of six, being the sum of all the
   numbers which make up the square of six. The square of six is 36; and,
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 +
   17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 +
   31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 = 666.

   But the great significance of this number is seen when we remember that
   the secret symbol of the great ancient Pagan mysteries was SSS or 666;
   and that to-day it is the secret connecting link between them and their
   revival in Spiritism and Theosophy which aim at the union of all
   religions in one.

   The number 666 is expressed in the Greek by the letters (...). The
   first (...) stands for 600, the second (...) for 60, and the third
   (...) for 6. The last is not a real letter, but was a mark invented by
   the Greeks to represent 6. They called it (...) (stigma [293] ), and it
   is not without significance that, as associated with man, the word has
   come to be used in a bad sense.

   The first and last of these three letters are the abbreviation of the
   word "Christ," being the first and last letters of the word Christos.
   So that, when we have the (...), like a crooked serpent, put between
   them, we see a fitting symbol of Satan's Messiah -- the Anti-Christ.

   in harmony with the expression in other parts of this Book.

   [277] This is the order here according to G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV., and

   [278] The Figure of Asyndeton, or "no ands," hurries us on to the great

   one. (See Figures of Speech, page 137.)

   [279] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit this verb, but nevertheless the

   [290] The only clue he gives to it is by comparing it to a blindfolded
   person obeying directions received through the ear. Astounding
   photographs are given of the power of these electrical currents which
   act on the "ear" tuned to receive the vibrations. In one of these
   photographs a volcano of devouring flame, sixty-five feet across, is
   shown, blazing from the centre of the "oscillator." Tesla himself, the
   coolest of men, described this a "a marvellous electrical phenomenon."

   [291] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read the plural thus.

   [292] L.T.Ab. WHb. omit (...) (kai) and.

   [293] Stigma is a sign usually made on the body (especially on the
   forehead and hands) by branding or puncturing, on slaves, soldiers, &c.
   It was especially used as a symbol of the god whom they served (Lev.
   xix. 28; xxi. 5. Deut. xiv. 1. 3 Macc. ii. 29), and supposed to be
   protective. This explains the use of the word in Gal. vi. 17. Paul
   regarded his wounds and scars received in the service of his Lord and
   God as not only being marks of his servitude, but marks implying that
   he was under God's protection. (Compare Isa. xlix. 16. Ezek. ix. 4. Ex.
   xiii. 9, 16). Therefore he says, beware how you trouble me! (this
   explains the word "for.") See also Rev. xiv. 1; vii. 2; ix. 4.

                          The Fifth Vision "In Heaven"

   H5, xiv. 1-5.
   The Lamb and the 144,000.


   The Fifth Vision in heaven is very brief. It is another Episode,
   telling us of those who will have come through the great Tribulation,
   and have been caught up to Heaven.

   It is part of the larger Episode, and is parenthetical. The previous
   vision on Earth has told us of those who were slain because they
   refused to worship the Beast or receive his mark. Those who were for
   death, had been killed; and those who were to be kept alive, have been
   kept alive (xiii. 10). The worshippers of the Beast received his mark;
   and these received the mark of the Lamb (Christ) and of His Father in
   their foreheads. This seems to point to the 144,000 sealed ones, of
   whose sealing we read in chap. vii. They had passed unscathed through
   the judgments of God, and through the persecutions of the Beast.

   The Vision occupies only five verses, and their Structure is as
   follows:--

   H^5, xiv. 1-5.  The Fifth Vision "in Heaven."
   The Lamb and the 144, 000

   H^5 |     A | xiv. 1.  Description.
                       B | 2.  The heavenly Voices.  The Singers.
                       B | 3.  The heavenly Voices.  The Song.
               A | 4, 5.  Description.


   xiv. 1. And I saw, and behold the [294] Lamb standing upon Mount Zion,
   and with him an hundred and forty-four thousand, having his name and
   His Father's name [295] written upon their foreheads.]      This was
   the promise made to the overcomers in iii. 12; and this was the seal of
   chap. vii. 3. At least this seems to be the case, though some regard
   this as another body. It seems, however, more natural to take them as
   the same; no other such number being mentioned, and nothing being said
   to prevent us making this mistake of identifying them.

   In chap. vii. we have the sealing; here, we have the end of which they
   were to be sealed. In chap. vii. the object of their sealing is that
   they might pass through the Tribulation unscathed; here we see the
   object attained. The result of their testimony will be seen in the
   formation of that body which will be the nucleus of the new nation.

   The Vision is in heaven; for the singers stand before the Throne, and
   they are with the Lamb. He is not yet descended to the Earth. This
   decides the point that it is the heavenly Zion which is here referred
   to. The Temple on Earth was close to Mount Zion; so the Temple in
   heaven is correspondingly near to the heavenly Zion.

   They are comparatively a small body, but these are the firstfruits to
   God and the Lamb; and the firstfruits are necessarily a small
   proportion compared with the harvest. In Rev. vii. 1-8 and xiv. we have
   the "firstfruits," and in Rev. vii. 9-17 and xv. the whole harvest, or
   the larger number.

   In the second verse we have the Heavenly voices and the singers. This
   again shows the Vision to be in Heaven; for none of these Heavenly
   Visions are without the utterances of Heavenly voices.

   xiv. 2. And I heard a voice out of heaven, as the voice of many waters,
   and as a voice of great thunder: and the voice which [296] I heard was
   as that of harpers, harping with their harps:]      The word rendered
   "harpers," (...) (kitharodon), denotes those who accompany the voice
   with the harp.

   The next verse is constructed as follows, showing the importance of its
   statements:--

   B, xiv. 3.  The Heavenly Voices.  The Song.

   B |     a | 3-.  The New Song. (pos.)
                     b | -3-.  The Place:  before the Throne.
            a | -3-.  The New Song. (neg.)
                     b | -3.  The Number.


   xiv. 3. And they sung, as it were, a new song before the Throne, and
   before the four Zoa, and the Elders: and no one was able to learn the
   song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been
   purchased from the earth]      Here we have the reference to their
   song. This is the only instance where the actual words of the song are
   not given. It is called "a New Song"; that is, it had a new subject or
   theme. As only the 144,000 could learn it or sing it, it probably
   concerned only themselves, and the wonderful miracles God had wrought
   in saving them from and through and out of the great and awful
   temptations and dangers hinted at in the concluding description in the
   4th and 5th verses. Only those who had gone through that Tribulation
   could understand the song which celebrated it. It is not a general
   statement that the wicked cannot participate in the joys of the church!
   but a far more important fact which is stated. The song is "new"
   because it is sung by a new company, and has a new theme for its
   subject.

   They sing it before the Throne,
                     before the Zoa, and
                     before the Elders.

   They can all understand and appreciate it, for they are participants in
   these judgment scenes.

   Its new theme can be gathered from the next two verses; the structure
   of which is as follows:--

   A, xiv. 4, 5.  The Second Description.

   A |     c |     e | 4-.  Character.  Undefiled. (neg.)
                             f | -4-.  Reason.
                                     d | -4-.  Employment.  Followers.
   (active.)
                                     d | -4.  State.  Redeemed.
   (passive.)
             c |     e | 5-.  Character.  Faultless.
                             f | -5.  Reason.


   The character of the singers is twice given; and the two are separated
   by the active and passive employment and condition of the singers.

   xiv. 4. These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are
   virgins.]      These words are generally taken as "figurative." But
   figures of speech are known, and can be named and defined. What is
   meant is that they are taken as symbolical, or as meaning something
   different from what is said. But this comes from not seeing the scope
   of the book as a whole, and from not discerning the real character of
   the days and of the religious condition of things. We have more than
   once, in the Epistles to the Assemblies, and on chap. ix. 20, 21, said
   that Fornication will be part of the great religious system of
   Anti-Christ in the coming time of trouble and temptation; as it formed
   an obligatory part of the great pagan systems of idolatry. Idolatry was
   not a mere sin into which people gradually sunk; but it was a Satanic
   device into which people rose in order to gratify the lusts of the
   flesh under the cloak of religion.

   Hence the references to Balaam (ii. 14) and Jezebel (ii. 20). Hence,
   too, the description of these 144,000 here, who had been kept from all
   these abominations. It is not merely that only one single virtue
   (chastity) is predicated of the redeemed in general, as some put it;
   but, it is a special feature of the evils from which this special
   company will be preserved, and for refusal to partake of it, multitudes
   (vii. 9-17; and xv. 1-4) will have suffered martyrdom. Only those who
   know what those evils will be can understand the import of their
   wonderful deliverance, or sing their song. It is not because of any
   moral difference between us and them; or between the ungodly and the
   righteous, but because of the different experience through which they
   will have passed. That is why none can learn that song; and that is the
   explanation of the words we are here considering; and that is why the
   pronoun "They" is so emphatic.

   -4. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These
   were purchased from among men, a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb.
   (5) And in their mouth was not found the lie, [297] for [298] they are
   blameless. [299] ]      i.e., blameless as to the matter above referred
   to; and have not received "the Lie" which all others will have
   believed. See 2 Thess. ii. 11, where the definite article is used, "the
   Lie," viz., the Lie that it is right to set God's laws at defiance by
   adopting the practices of the new Religion framed by the infernal
   Trinity of Satan, the Beast, and the False Prophet. The three
   explanatory statements, each commencing "these are they," are to be
   taken literally, and as meaning just what they say. The teaching of
   demons in 1 Tim. iv. 3 in "forbidding to marry and commanding to
   abstain from meats," goes far deeper than Popish celibacy of the
   clergy, and Fasting. This teaching "forbidding to marry" comes from the
   Abyss, and is connected with Anti-christ's Religion; while the
   "abstaining from meats" is only to weaken people's will-power, and to
   make them more susceptible to the influences of these evil angels and
   demons.

                          The Fifth Vision "On Earth"

   E5, xiv. 6-20.
   The Six Angels and the Son of Man.


   The next vision which follows "on earth," follows closely on the last,
   and is preliminary to the pouring out of the seven Vials. No angel has
   been seen or heard since the seventh angel sounded the seventh trumpet
   in xi. 15. This shows us that the passage xii. 1-- 8 is parenthetical,
   and constitutes one series or episode.

   This fifth vision on earth consists of the appearance of six angels
   consecutively, each having his separate mission, and all but one (the
   fifth) having his own proclamation. They are distinct from each other,
   and continue the Episode by giving us God's side of what is going to
   happen; and telling us of what He is doing during the time that the
   Beast and False Prophet are running their course in chap. xiii. They
   form also a compendium of all the remaining judgments contained in the
   rest of the Book.

   The six angels with the Son of Man make seven heavenly appearances and
   utterances. These are divided, as shown in the Structure [below], into
   three and four. The first three stand out clearly by themselves. The
   last four form two pairs, in which the first of each has a sharp
   sickle, and the second of each gives the command to use it. The first
   of these pairs is the Harvest, and the second is the Vintage.

   The following is the structure of this Vision as a whole:--

   E^5 xiv. 6-20.  The Fifth Vision "on Earth."

   E^5 |     A |                  i. |     a^1 | 6.  The First Angel.
                                                   b^1 | 7.  His
   Proclamation.
                                    ii. |     a^2 | 8-.  The Second
   Angel.
                                                   b^2 | -8.  His
   Declaration.
                                    iii.|     a^3 | 9-.  The Third Angel.
                                                   b^3 | -9-13.  His
   Denunciation (-9-11).  His Consolation. (12, 13).
               A |     B |      iv. |     a^4 | 14-.  The Son of Man.
                                                   b^4 | -14.  What he
   had.  A sharp sickle.
                                   v. |      a^5 | 15-.  The Fourth Angel.
                                                    b^5 | -15, 16.  His
   Command to the Son of Man (-15).  Its Execution. (16).
                         B |     vi. |      a^6 | 17-.  The Fifth Angel.
                                                    b^6 | -17.  What he
   had.  A sharp sickle.
                                 vii. |      a^7 | 18-.  The Sixth Angel.
                                                    b^7 | -18-20.  His
   Command to the Fifth Angel (-18).  Its Execution (19, 20).


   The First Angel (xiv. 6, 7).

   xiv. 6. And I saw another [300] angel flying in mid-heaven, having the
   everlasting gospel to announce unto those that dwell on the earth, and
   unto [301] every nation and tribe, and tongue, and people, (7) saying
   with a loud voice, "Fear God, and give glory to Him; because the hour
   of His judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven, and the
   earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water."]

   We have to remember that though the Gospel is often used in a technical
   sense, the word itself means glad tidings or good news. It is clear
   that this news may vary and yet be good. As a matter of fact there are
   several subjects connected with this good news. It will be sufficient
   to mention the "gospel of the kingdom," and "the gospel of the grace of
   God." All are preached, and are to be preached, according to the
   dispensations to which they belong. For example, in the present
   dispensation it is only "the gospel of the grace of God" which is to be
   preached (Acts xx. 24), and he is accursed who now preaches a different
   gospel (Gal. i. 8). "The gospel of the Kingdom" was preached by John
   the Baptist, by Christ, and by Peter, &c. (Matt. iv. 23; ix. 35). And
   it will yet be preached again in the Great Tribulation, after the
   Church of God has been taken away (Matt. xxiv. 14), up to this point;
   and then it will be replaced by "The Eternal Gospel," as it is rendered
   in the RV. It is so called because it takes us back to the beginning,
   and tells of the earliest good news, or gospel, preached from God as
   Creator, and consists of the one great truth which was preached from
   the beginning. It is manifest that it cannot be "everlasting" in the
   strict sense of the word, because when "the hour of his judgment is
   come," and gone, it will not be possible to preach it any longer. This
   settles the matter for us. If it did not, it is equally clear that
   God's gospel of grace which is preached now consists of something more
   than the fact that men are to "fear God"! And who would dare to preach
   now that "the hour of His judgment (or crisis) has come." No, this
   "everlasting gospel" cannot be preached now. The moment has not yet
   arrived when these words can be proclaimed. We can tell of "judgment to
   come" (Acts xxiv. 25, (...) (mellontos), coming), but not of the "hour"
   having actually arrived. If "grace" and "judgment" are the same thing,
   then again we may say that words are useless for the purposes of
   revelation. "Now is the day of salvation" not of judgment (2 Cor. vi.
   2).

   It is therefore eternal in the sense that it belongs to the first and
   the last of the dispensations in which God deals with men. It goes back
   to the beginning, before the Law. It tells of God's claim as Creator;
   and not of Christ's work as Saviour. "Now I know that thou fearest God"
   was God's word to Abraham (Gen. xxii. 12). "This do and live, for I
   fear God," said Joseph (Gen. xlii. 18). So with Job (i. 1); and the
   Egyptian midwives (Ex. i. 17-21). The "fearers of God" was a title
   specially given to proselytes from the Gentiles (Acts xiii. 16, 26).

   The time will have then come to add the sentence in Isa. lxi. 2, which
   the Lord omitted when He read Isa. lxi. 1, 2-, in the Synagogue at
   Nazareth (Luke iv. 18-20): "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me," &c.,
   down to and including the first sentence of verse 2, "to preach the
   acceptable year of the Lord." Then it is significantly added that "he
   closed the book and sat down." Why? Because that was not yet the time
   to preach what follows in Isa. lxi. 2, viz., "the day of vengeance of
   our God." But here, when this first angel preaches in mid-heaven to all
   on earth, the time will have come to preach this "day of vengeance," as
   having then come. It was through falling into the mistake of not
   "rightly dividing the word of truth," and distinguishing its times and
   seasons and Dispensations, that the church of the Thessalonians was so
   upset. A forged letter had been sent to them, in which Paul is
   represented as having taught that "the Day of the Lord had set in" (2
   Thess. ii. 2). Of course, if that had been the case, they saw they had
   not been "caught up to meet the Lord in the air" before that great and
   terrible Day, and they had every need to be "troubled"; for their faith
   and their hope were alike "in vain." Indeed, though faith remained,
   "hope" seems to have gone, for while in 1 Thess. i. 3 it was mentioned,
   in 2 Thess. i. 3 it is omitted. So Paul proceeds to undeceive them and
   give them further revelations as to the Lord's Coming.

   And, observe here, it is not the "day of his judgment is come," but
   "the hour." This refers of course to the last and final crisis of the
   judgment -- the seven Vials -- which closes everything up. "Fear God
   and give glory to him... worship him (not the Beast) who made the
   heaven and the earth," &c. It is God as creator who is proclaimed, and
   that by an angel, not by men. The heavenly utterances proclaim the
   Father and the Son, but here it is the Creator. That is the basis on
   which worship is demanded. What a state the earth must then be in, when
   only this one part of the primeval gospel can be proclaimed. This takes
   place probably before Rev. xiii.

   And yet, in spite of all this, Commentators take it as "the
   inauguration of Christian missions," or "the operations of the Bible
   Society"! These words could never have been read with their context by
   those who thus misinterpret them! No! this is the first step in these
   angelic announcements. A solemn note of warning is loudly sounded.


   The Second Angel (xiv. 8).

   xiv. 8. And another, a second [302] angel followed, saying,

   "Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great, [303] which [304] hath given all
   the nations to drink of the exciting wine of her fornication."]

   This is the first mention of Babylon in the Apocalypse, and it gathers
   up in this brief preliminary announcement the whole of chapters xvii.
   and xviii. The words of this angel are prophetic, and look forward to
   the pouring out of the last Vial. The judgment on Babylon, therefore,
   closes up the whole series of God's judgments. Chap. xvii. 1-3 and
   xviii. 2, 3 are identified by the announcement of this second angel.

   While the action of the first angel goes back to a time prior to chap.
   xiii., the words of the second angel take us on to beyond the end of
   that chapter. If we take the word (...) (thumos) as meaning
   inflammatory or exciting, as it does when used of wine, all difficulty
   is taken away. Her "fornications" refer us back to the prevailing
   religion of that time, as we have seen in xiv. 4, 5, above; and this is
   the cause of her judgment. What this Babylon is we shall see when we
   come to consider chapter xvii.


   The Third Angel (xiv. 9-13).

   Five verses are devoted to the third Angel and his announcement. The
   Structure shows that this member "b3" is two-fold; viz.:

   b^3 |  His Denunciation:  verses -9-11; and
        |  His Consolation:  verses 12, 13.

   These two are of such importance that each has its own separate
   structure.

   The Denunciation is twice announced: at the beginning, "c," and at the
   end, "c." From this we see the special nature of the sin which is to be
   punished: It is the worship of the Beast, and the receiving of his mark
   (charagma). Between these mentions of the sin, we have the punishment
   which is threatened. First positive; then negative. The Structure is
   designed to call our attention to the solemnity and importance of the
   mission of this Third Angel. We give the structure of His Denunciation
   first:--

   b^3, xiv. -9-11.  The Denunciation of the Third Angel.

   b^3 |     c | -9.  The Crime denounced.        x | -9-.  Worship of the
   Beast.
                                                                       y |
   -9.  Receiving his mark.
                   d | 10-.  The punishment (positive).  Drink.
                           e |     f | -10-.  Torment.
                                       g | -10.  Its nature. (fire)
                           e |     f | 11-.  Torment.
                                       g | -11-.  Its duration (eternal).
                   d | -11-.  The punishment (negative).  No rest.
              c | -11.  The Crime denounced.    x | -11-.  Worship of
   Beast.
                                                                      y |
   -11.  Receiving his mark.


   This proclamation again takes us back to a time prior to chap. xiii. It
   is a solemn warning as though directed against an opposite proclamation
   which the Beast will then have made or be about to make.

   This warning naturally follows the designation of the sins for which
   the judgment is announced.

   xiv. 9. And another, [305] a third Angel followed them, saying with a
   loud voice:

   "If anyone worshippeth the Beast and his image, and receiveth his mark
   on his forehead, or on his hand, (10) even he shall drink of the wine
   of God's fury, which is mingled undiluted in the cup of his wrath; and
   he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the
   angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; (11) And the smoke of their
   torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day and
   night, who worship the Beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the
   mark (or brand) of his name."]

   Here we have one of the most solemn warnings given in the whole of the
   Bible. It must not be toned down in the slightest degree, but taken in
   all the fulness of its awful meaning. It ought to be sufficient to warn
   thousands from yielding to the temptations or submitting to the threats
   of the Beast and the False Prophet. Their threats and enticements will
   be serious enough. But God's threat here is intended to outweigh them,
   and enable many to "endure unto the end." Here will be the "patient
   endurance of the saints." Here they will be strengthened and encouraged
   to "keep the commandments of God," and not the commandments of the
   Beast; to keep "the faith of Jesus," and not believe the Religion of
   the False Prophet. If this warning will not keep them, nothing will.

   The consolation given affirms that it will be better to die than to
   yield: better to have the blessing connected with death, even the
   martyr's death, than to live and come under God's curse and suffer the
   vengeance of eternal fire. If we take the first part of t his threat of
   the future and everlasting state, we may take the latter part as
   referring to their previous condition on the earth, as "day and night"
   can hardly be spoken of the eternal state. "And they have no rest who
   are worshipping," etc. It is the present participle, and cannot mean
   who have worshipped or did worship; "receiveth" is also in the present
   tense, implying that on earth they will have no rest day and night
   while they are engaged in worshipping the Beast; and as to eternity,
   "the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."

   This prepares us for the consolation which follows, which is also
   intended as an encouragement.

   Its structure is as follows:

   b, xiv. 12, 13.  The Consolation of the Third Angel.

   b |     h |     k | 12-.  The "Patience" of the saints.
                           l | -12.  The "Obedience" of the saints.
                                   j |     m | 13-.  The Voice from
   heaven.
                                                   n | -13-.  Benediction.
           h |     k | -13-.  The "Rest" of the saints.
                           l | -13.  The "Works" of the saints.


   12. Here is the patient endurance of the saints: who keep the
   commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. (13) And I heard a voice
   from heaven saying: [306]

   "Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth:"]

   This is another voice: not that of the third angel. The connection is
   clear; "from henceforth" refers to death from that time. It is
   persecution, ending in certain death. Hence the special Benediction
   here pronounced upon all such as die rather than yield to the
   temptations and threats of the Beast and the False Prophet. "Worship,
   or be slain" is their cry. "Be slain, and be blessed" is God's
   encouraging reply to them. That blessing is seen in xiv. 1-5, and xv.
   1-4, and the words refer to these Scriptures.

   "Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their troubles, for
   [307] their works follow them."]

   The word (...) (kopon), which we have rendered "troubles," is from
   (...) (kopto) to beat; to beat the breast; hence, to lament. (See Matt.
   xi. 17; xxi. 8; xxiv. 30. Luke viii. 52; xxiii. 27. Rev. i. 7; xviii.
   9). The noun may well, therefore, denote troubles. See Matt. xxvi. 10:
   "Why do ye give trouble to the woman?" So Mark xiv. 6. Luke xi. 7;
   xviii. 5. Gal. vi. 17.

   It is violent death that is in question here; not the "falling asleep"
   of saints in this dispensation. The words have no reference to the
   present state of things. They cannot be interpreted of the Church of
   God; though, of course, by way of general application, it is always
   better to die than worship any idol, or have fellowship with idolators.
   Their "works" which follow them consist of their "testimony," their
   "obedience," and their "patient endurance," so frequently mentioned in
   this book. These works do not go before them to procure their reward,
   but they follow after as the evidence of their obedience.


   The Son of Man, and the Last Three Angels. A., xiv. 14-20.

   The Six Angelic Appearances of this fifth Vision on Earth are made into
   seven by the Vision of the Son of Man in the centre. These seven are
   divided in four and three, as usual.

   We have considered the first three. The last four go together, and are
   closely connected; the first two with the HARVEST, and the last two
   with the VINTAGE.

   The Son of Man stands out as the centre of the whole seven, thus
   dividing the six angels into two threes. This is seen from the
   Structure of the whole of this Vision [in the section The Six Angels
   and the Son of Man].

   The last four form two pairs. The first of each pair is seen with a
   sharp sickle in his hand; while the second of each pair gives forth the
   command for it to be used. In the first pair the Harvest of the earth
   is reaped. In the second pair the Vintage of the earth is gathered.

   We now have to present the last four together, and give the Structure,
   which is as follows:--

   A. xiv. 14-20.  The Son of Man, and the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth
   Angels.

   A |     B |     iv. |  14.  The Son of Man and His sharp sickle.
                           v. |     o | 15-.  The Fourth Angel, and whence
   he comes (Temple).
                                             p | -15-.  His cry to the Son
   of Man.
                                                     q | -15.  Command to
   reap.
                                                              r | 16-.
   Reasons.
                                                                      s |
   -16-.  Compliance.

       t | -16.  The Harvest reaped.
              B |     vi.| 17.  The Fifth Angel and his sharp sickle.
                           vii.     o | 18-.  The Sixth Angel, and whence
   he comes (Altar).
                                             p | -18-.  His cry to the
   Fifth angel.
                                                     q | -18-.  Command to
   reap.
                                                              r | -18.
   Reason.
                                                                      s |
   19-.  Compliance.

       t | -19, 20.  The Vintage gathered.


   The Harvest and the Vintage are reaped and gathered respectively by the
   Son of Man, and the Fifth Angel, though they are recorded under the
   Fourth and Sixth Angels, as shown in the Structure.

   xiv. 14. And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud I
   saw one sitting like unto the Son of Man, having upon His head a golden
   crown (stephanos), and in His hand a sharp sickle.]      The Son of Man
   was the sower (Matt. xiii. 37); and the Son of Man is the reaper. This
   is the last time the title is used in the Bible. It connects the Lord
   Jesus with the earth, and is therefore used of this "harvest of the
   earth."

   When the title was first used in the day of His humiliation (Matt.
   viii. 20), He had no where, on the earth, to lay His head. But now, in
   the day of His judgment, He has on that head a crown of gold. He is on
   the cloud, and invisible on earth; but though unseen, the effects of
   the sharp sickle in His hand will soon be manifest. This crown is
   associated with Ps. xxi. 3: "Thou settest a crown of pure gold upon his
   head"; for it is a token of His incoming of Dominion; and "Thou
   settest" is put in strong contrast with the "crown of thorns" which
   others set upon His head at His first coming.


   The Fourth Angel and the Harvest (xiv. 15, 16).

   xiv. 15. And another Angel came out of the Temple (Naos), crying with a
   loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud,

   "Put in Thy sickle, and reap: because the hour is come [308] to reap;
   because the harvest of the earth is ripe."]

   There can be no doubt that this is a judgment scene. The title "Son of
   Man" betokens it; for God hath "committed all judgment unto the Son,
   because He is the Son of Man" (John v. 27). The Old Testament connects
   this harvest with judgment; for a precisely similar command is given in
   Joel iii. 13: "put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe," and this
   is mentioned in close connection with the vintage: "come you down; for
   the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great."
   This is the scene in which "the sun and moon shall be darkened" (verse
   15).

   Most Commentators allow that the Vintage is judicial; then, why not the
   Harvest. The one is "the vine of the earth," and the other is "the
   harvest of the earth." It is the earth that is ripe, and what can this
   be ripe for, but for judgment? The Vine is "the Vine of the Earth"; the
   Harvest is "the Harvest of the Earth. We thus have the two great
   spheres in which judgment will be carried out, most clearly and
   explicitly put before us.

   What is seen here is one of the six brief announcements connected with
   and filling up that which goes before; heralding and explaining in a
   few words certain judgments yet to follow.

   xiv. 16. And He that sat upon the cloud put forth His sickle upon the
   earth; and the earth was reaped.]      The word "earth" is repeated so
   as to impress our minds with the fact that it is with the earth, as the
   earth, that we have to do here. It is "the hour of His judgment" which
   has come. How this can be interpreted of the "church," or be taken in
   the good sense of reward, we are at a loss to understand. The first of
   these six angels used precisely the same words (verse 7). It is 2
   Thess. i. 6-8 that we have here. When the time has come for Him to
   "gather out of His kingdom all things that offend" (Matt. xiii. 41),
   "immediately He putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come"
   (Mark iv. 29). Matt. xxiv. 37-42 must be read in connection with the
   scene here referred to. The good may be gathered into barns: these
   barns are seen in the next chapter; but the though connected with the
   harvest is judgment. And why a "sharp" sickle. The vintage is
   admittedly judicial (verses 18-20), and that is gathered with a sharp
   sickle. That the harvest is judicial also is confirmed by a reference
   to Jer. li. 33: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; The
   daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor, it is time to thresh
   her: yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come."
   Babylon is mentioned in the verses immediately preceding this harvest
   (chap. xiv. 8); and chap. xvii. and xviii. identify it with Jer. li.
   33, for "the harvest is the end of the age."

   After the harvest comes the vintage, in the order of nature; so there
   it is the same in the order of judgment.

   This brings us to


   The Fifth Angel (xiv. 17).

   xiv. 17. And another angel came out of the Temple (Naos) which is in
   heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.]      And it is to him that the
   Sixth Angel calls upon to gather the vintage.


   The Sixth Angel and the Vintage (xiv. 18-20).

   xiv. 18 And another angel came out of the altar who [309] hath
   authority over its fire: and he cried with a loud voice to him that had
   the sharp sickle, saying,

   "Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the
   earth, for her grapes are fully ripened."

   (19) And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
   the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the
   wrath of God. (20) And the winepress was trodden without the city, and
   blood came out of the winepress, even up to the bits of the horses, to
   the distance of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.]      This, too,
   takes in the final judgments of this book. Both of these angels are the
   servants of "the Lord of the earth" (xi. 4). Three times are we
   reminded that the sickle was "sharp," and therefore would do its
   business without difficulty. The vine is "the vine of the earth" (See
   Deut. xxxii. 32, 33).

   We have here a fore-announcement of the sixth Vial (xvi. 12-16) and of
   the great battle of Armageddon. It is to this scene that Joel iii.
   12-15 refers, where we read "the press is full, the fats overflow." And
   this is closely connected with the "harvest" in the same verse.
   (Compare Zeph. iii. 8. Isa. xxxiv. 1-8). Rev. xix. 15 tells us of this
   treading of the Wine-press. And Isaiah records it in chap. lxiii. 1-4.
   Nothing can equal the awful nature of those final judgments of the
   seven Vials, which are here epitomized in the few words describing this
   harvest and this vintage. "Threshing" is the end of the one, and
   "treading" is the end of the other; and it is Palestine and not Italy;
   Jerusalem and not Rome, which is in question here.

                          The Sixth Vision "In Heaven"

   H^6, Chap. xv.
   The Seven Vial Angels.


   This Sixth Vision is Heaven is very briefly described. It occupies this
   fifteenth chapter, which consists of only eight verses.

   The structure of the Vision is as follows:--

   H^6, xv. 1-8. The Sixth Vision "in Heaven."
   The Seven Vial Angels.

   H^6 |     A | xv. 1.  The Seven Angels.
                       B | 2-4.  Worship offered.
              A | 5-7.  The Seven Angels.
                       B | 8.  Worship no longer possible.


   It is the Vision which introduces us to the most terrible of all the
   Visions which affect the earth; for it is followed by the Seven Vials,
   the seven great and final judgments which close up the whole series set
   forth in chapters--

   xvi. The Great Judgments.
   xvii. The Great Whore.
   xviii. The Great City.

   The next, and last, Vision in Heaven is immediately followed by the
   Apocalypse of the Son of Man Himself.

   Short as this sixth Vision is, it is full of significance, and points
   to the decisive results to be obtained in the next Vision on Earth, to
   which it introduces us.

   This is clearly set out in the first member:

   xv. 1. And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvellous: seven
   angels having the last seven plagues (or, seven plagues, which are the
   last); because in them was completed the wrath (or fury) of God:]
   The word "because" is connected with the word "last," as shown in the
   alternative rendering, above. This sign is "great and wonderful," i.e.,
   wonderfully great in its nature and extent and importance and results.
   It is the completion of the "covenant of marvels" which the Lord made
   with Israel in Ex. xxxiv. 10. The plagues themselves are not yet. They
   do not actually follow till the next chapter; and then they follow on
   from the sounding of the seventh Trumpet. The Trumpet contains, and
   consists of, and expands into, the seven Vials, and is "the third Woe"
   Trumpet. The results of that sounding are about to take place: and they
   are heralded by the Heavenly utterance, which sets forth their object.
   The sign itself is given in the first verse.

   xv. 2. And I saw, as it were, a glassy sea]      It does not say it was
   glass, or even glassy, but that it looked as if it were glassy or
   smooth. It was

   mingled with fire:]      In iv. 6 it was "like crystal." Here it looks
   as though fire were mingled with it, betokening the heat and fierceness
   of the coming judgments which were then about to be announced; for
   wrath was at its height.

   and those that had gotten the victory from the Beast, and from his
   image, and from [310] the number of his name standing upon the glassy
   sea, having harps of God (i.e., Divine or Sacred harps).]      The
   worshippers here are particularly defined as those who had come out of
   and through the great Tribulation. Their numbers are not given, so that
   they appear to be distinct from, or to include the 144,000 mentioned in
   the previous chapter and in chap. vii. They may be "the remnant of the
   woman's seed" (xii. 17), for they, by Divine protection, were
   "overcomers." If so, this glassy sea is in contrast with the Red Sea;
   while the harps tell of the Kingdom at length come; for we do not read
   of harps in the earthly temple till the Kingdom was set up on earth.

   In the previous Vision in Heaven (the Fifth), singing is mentioned, but
   no words are given, for the song was "new," and no one but the singers
   themselves could learn or understand it.

   The song which is sung in this Sixth Vision is both old and new, for it
   is the song of Moses and of the Lamb:

   xv. 3. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
   of the Lamb,]      Why these two songs are always regarded as one, and
   referred to Exodus xv., we do not understand. Alford says "it is not
   meant that there are two distinct songs; the song is one and the same,"
   and it is "similar to that song of triumph" in Exodus xv. The simple
   question is, Whom are we to believe. If words are of any use, it says
   two songs, as plainly as words can say it. The word "song" is twice
   repeated. "The song of Moses and the servant of the Lord" is one song,
   and "The song of the Lamb" is another song. There is nothing about the
   former being "similar" to Exodus xv. Such an interpretation as that
   robs the whole statement of all accuracy, deprives it of its beauty,
   and takes from us the instruction which is intended to be conveyed to
   us. In Exodus xv. 1 it merely says, "Then sang Moses and the children
   of Israel this song," and it is as much connected with Miriam as with
   Moses, as to human agency in authorship.

   But there is a song, particularly and definitely described as "the song
   of Moses," in Deut. xxxii. And a most wonderful song it is.

   This we believe to be "the song of Moses" which is sung here; while the
   words given in Rev. xv., in verses -3 and 4, are "the song of the
   Lamb."

   "The song of Moses" in Deut. xxxii. 1-43, is a rehearsal of God's
   dealing with Israel from the beginning to the end. It is an epitome of
   the history of the whole nation in its relation to God. It is
   introduced to us in Deut. xxxi. 19: "Now, therefore, write ye this song
   for you, and teach it the children of Israel; put it in their mouths,
   that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
   (20) For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
   unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall
   have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn
   unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
   (21) And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have
   befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
   for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I
   know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have
   brought them into the land which I sware. (22) Moses therefore wrote
   this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel." Then in
   verse 28 we read that Moses said "Gather unto me all the chiefs of your
   tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears,
   and call heaven and earth to record against them: (29) For I know that
   after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from
   the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you IN THE
   LATTER DAY, because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to
   provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. And Moses spake in
   the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of THIS SONG until
   they were ended."

   Introduced with such solemnity, we expect to find something most
   wonderful and significant in "the words of this song"; and we are not
   disappointed.

   It is divided into ten members (ten, the number of ordinal perfection,
   marking its completeness), and these members are arranged as an
   Introversion: the first corresponding, in its subject, with the tenth;
   the second corresponding with the ninth; the third with the eighth; the
   fourth with the seventh; and the fifth with the sixth.

   All the stages of Israel's history receive the Divine description and
   verdict; and the Scriptures recording that history are marshalled in
   their order.

   It will not be necessary for us to give all the words of this song; but
   our readers will turn to the place where it is written, and read it
   with the key to it which we now give. They will at once see the wonders
   of this song, and understand why it should be heaven's theme at this
   particular juncture in this Sixth Vision in heaven, immediately before
   those judgments which shall fulfil all its words:--

   "The Song of Moses" (Deut. xxxii. 1-43).

   A | 1-6. God's call to Hear: and the reason. The publishing of
   Jehovah's name: His perfect work and righteous ways.

       B | 7-14. The goodness and bounty of Jehovah to Israel. (Period of
   the Pentateuch).

           C | 15-19. Israel's evil return for that goodness. Their pride:
   forsaking of God; despising the Rock of their Salvation; moving Him to
   anger. (Period, past history. The Historical books).

               D | 20. Divine reflections on the period while Israel is
   "Lo Ammi" (not my people). (Period of Minor Prophets, esp. Hosea).

                   E | 21. Jehovah's provocation of Israel. (Period of
   Acts and present Dispensation).

                   E | 22-25. Jehovah's threatening of judgment on Israel
   in the great Tribulation.

               D | 26-33. Divine reflections on the period while Israel is
   scattered. (Hosea).

           C | 34-38. Israel's evil return for Jehovah's goodness. Their
   helpless condition moving Him to pity. He not forsaking them. Their
   Rock useless. (Period of present history).

       B | 39-42. The Judgments of Jehovah. (The period of the
   Apocalypse).

   A | 43. God's call to Rejoice: and the reason. The publishing of
   Jehovah's Kingdom. Vengeance on Israel's enemies. Mercy for His Land
   and for His People. (Fulfilment of all Prophecy).


   How fitting that now, and here, at this stage of the Apocalyptic
   visions and judgments, the witness and testimony of this Song should be
   rehearsed, as intimated in Deut. xxxi. 19, and that another Song should
   be associated with it, adding and combining such phrases of Ex. xv. as
   will be appropriate for that particular season which shall then have
   arrived.

   The words of "the Song of Moses" are given in Deut. xxxii.: and the
   words of "the Song of the Lamb" (i.e., given by Him and relating to
   Him), are now recorded, as follows:

   -3. saying,

   "Great and marvellous are Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty:
   Righteous and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the nations. [311] (4)
   Who should not fear, [312] O Lord, And glorify Thy name?

   Because thou only are holy: Because all the nations shall come and
   worship before Thee: Because Thy righteous judgments were manifested."]

   These are the words of "the Song of the Lamb," and they tell us that,
   in spite of the awful character of these coming judgments, God is
   "Holy" and "Righteous" and "True." The Old Testament Titles are heaped
   together here. "The Lord God," pointing us back to Gen. ii. iii., and
   the setting right of all that was then put wrong. "Almighty," or the
   Lord God of Hosts (see Preliminary Points). He is the God of the hosts
   of Israel (Ex. xii. 41, 51). "The Song of the Lamb" looks forward to
   the completion of all that "the Song of Moses" foretells.

   Many passages in the Prophets and Psalms speak of the same glorious
   result of God's judgments.

   The first of the Six Angels (xiv. 6, 7), had proclaimed that Gospel
   which is from everlasting, which calls on all to "Fear God:" and now
   the heavenly singers ask, "Who shall not fear Thee?" They take up the
   very words of Jer. x. 7; and to this time Ps. cii. 13-22 and Micah vii.
   16, 17 refer.

   But Ps. lxxxvi. 9-12 is specially to the point:

   "All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O
   Lord:
   And shall glorify Thy name,
   For Thou are great, and doest wondrous things.
   Thou art God alone.
   Teach me Thy way, O Lord: I will walk in Thy truth;
   Unite my heart to fear Thy name.
   I will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart:
   And I will glorify Thy name for evermore."

   "The Song of the Lamb," it will be seen, is made up of nine lines, nine
   being the number associated with judgment. [313]

   The second of the three reasons, "Because all the nations shall come
   and worship before Thee," points to one of the results of completed
   judgments, realised in Millennial days. (See Is. lxvi. 15, 16, 23.
   Zech. xiv. 16, 17. Ps. lxvi. 1-7; lxxii. 1-4; lxxxvi. 8,9. Zeph. ii.
   11).

   The third reason is the "righteous judgments" of God, which will then
   be made manifest. This is the meaning of (...) (dikaiomata). Lit. it is
   righteousnesses, but the form of the word denotes the outcome of the
   righteous act, the righteous thing done; [314] and the thing done, must
   be added, according to what the context requires. Here, it is
   "righteous judgments." That they are, and always will be righteous is
   testified again and again. (See Isa. lix. 18, 19).

   With this agree the closing words of "the Song of Moses" (Deut. xxxii.
   41-43).

   "Rejoice, O ye nations, with His People:
   For He will avenge the blood of His servants,
   And will render vengeance to His adversaries,
   And will be merciful unto His Land,
   And to His People."

   Compare also Ps. lxxvi. 8, 9. Is. xxvi. 5, 8, 9. Ezek. xxxix. 17, 21.

   xv. 5. And after these things I looked, and [315] the Temple (Naos) of
   the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven: (6) and the seven
   angels who [316] had the seven plagues, came forth out of the temple
   (Naos), arrayed with precious [317] brilliant stone,|| and girt about
   their breasts with golden girdles. (7) And one of the four Zoa gave to
   the seven angels seven golden Vials (or Bowls) full of the fury of God,
   who liveth for ever and ever]      We have already noticed above that
   both the Tabernacle of Moses and the Temple of Solomon were only copies
   of the Tabernacle and Temple in Heaven. The Realities were there, the
   copies were on earth. It was the Naos or Holy of Holies which was
   opened, i.e., the Naos of the Tabernacle. Opened to give exit for the
   seven angels from the presence of God, as it was in chap. xi. 19. Again
   the Zoa are introduced as initiating judgments. The Zoa are related to
   Creation and to the earth, as we have seen, and these judgments are to
   clear the earth of all that causes creation's groanings. We have
   retained the word "Vials" because its usage is so fixed and associated
   with these judgments, though all know that the (...) (phiale) as a
   shallow bowl. The bowls were golden, and belonged to the altar.

   || L.Tr. WH. and RV. read (...) (lithon) stone, instead of (...)
   (linon) linen. Compare Ezek. xxviii. 13 and Dan. x. 6.

   xv. 8. And the Naos (or Holiest) was filled with smoke from the glory
   of God, and from His power; and no one was able to enter into the Naos,
   until the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.]
   When the Tabernacle was opened by Moses and the Temple by Solomon,
   there was cloud, but not smoke (Ex. xl. 34-36. 1 Kings viii. 10, 11).
   Here it is "smoke," for this is the hour of God's judgment (xiv. 7). No
   intercession can now be made. No worship can be offered while it lasts.
   It will be again as it was in the days of Lam. iii. 44:--

   "Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,
    That our prayer should not pass through."

   Five of the ten plagues of Egypt are the same as five of these Bowls,
   as we shall see below. We would only add here, that as they were
   literal, so will these be.

   We have now come to the end of the long parenthesis and series of
   Episodes which are given in chap. xii. 1-- 8. We now take up again the
   results of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet in the chronological
   order of events. Chap. xi. -19, gave us the general but very brief
   summary of those results, in the third Vision on Earth. The full
   detailed account of these results would have postponed too long several
   things necessary for us to know, had they been given in exact
   chronological sequence. We have now had that necessary knowledge
   interposed, and are ready to take up the events in their proper order.

                          The Sixth Vision "On Earth"

   E^6, chaps. xvi., xvii., xviii.
   V. Chap. xvi. The Seven Vials.


   This is by far the most important of all the Visions seen by John, in
   relation to the earth.

   It has also the largest space apportioned to its description.

   It consists of the great judgments introduced by the sounding of the
   seventh Trumpet, which completes "The Mystery of God," by the pouring
   out of the seven Vials. The next Vision is the last seen in Heaven, and
   it introduces the actual Revelation or Apocalupsis of the Lord Jesus,
   personally, to the earth; and thus brings on the conclusion of the
   whole prophecy.

   This Sixth Vision on Earth consists of three divisions, which are so
   marked and distinct that those who divided the chapters found no
   difficulty in making a right division here.

   The following brief structure of this Vision as a whole, is shown to
   consist of these three. Their many and various expansions will follow
   in their respective places. The readers will find no difficulty in
   following and connecting them, if the references to the back pages and
   letters be carefully noted:--

   E^6, chap. xvi.-- The Sixth Vision "on Earth."
   The Seven Vials

   E^6 |     V | xvi.  The Great Judgments. (The Seven Vials).
             W | xvii.  The Great Whore.  (Mystery Babylon).
              X | xviii.  The Great City. (Great Babylon).


   Of these three we commence with the first, which we have marked "V,"
   and which consists of the whole of chap. xvi., describing

   V. chap. xvi. The Great Judgments.

   Eleven times we have the word "great" in this chapter; more often than
   in any other chapter in the New Testament, the next being chap. xviii.,
   where it occurs nine times.

   We are justified, therefore, in entitling the judgments and subjects of
   these chapters as "great."

   All is now ready to begin this final assault on the kingdom of the
   Infernal Trinity-- the Dragon, the Beast, and the False Prophet, which
   will mark "the great and terrible day of the Lord."

   Since we were told of the sounding of the seventh Trumpet (xi. 15), we
   have been taken back and enlightened as to several important
   particulars, so that we might understand more clearly the relation of
   these Visions to each other; we have been informed, by the last
   heavenly utterances, what we are to look for as the result of these
   judgments.

   The Dragon is to be attacked in his capital and on his throne. The
   Beasts are to be attacked in their seats of authority; and their
   followers and worshippers are to "have no rest day and night" upon the
   earth (xiv. 11).

   There is some similarity between the Vial-judgments and those of the
   Trumpets; but there are some variations also.

   The structure of this first division "V," shows that these seven Vials
   are divided into five groups: each consisting of cause and effect. The
   third and sixth are marked off by an additional characteristic: the
   third by "things heard," the sixth by "things seen." The Structure is
   as follows:--

   V. chap. xvi.  The Great Judgments.  (The 7 Vials).

   V |     A^1 |     a^1 | xvi. 1, 2.  The First Vial.
                                b^1 | -2.  Effect.   Sore on worshippers
   of Beast.
                        a^2 | 3-.  The Second Vial.
                                b^2 | -3.  Effect.  Sea, blood.
                                         B^1 |     c | 4-.  The Third
   Vial.
                                                             d | -4.
   Effect.  Rivers, blood.
                                                                      e |
   5-7.  Things heard.  (Angelic voices).
            A^2 |     a^3 | 8-.  The Fourth Vial.
                                b^3 | -8, 9.  Effect. Scorching.
   Worshippers of Beast impenitent.
                       a^4 | 10-.  The Fifth Vial.
                                b^4 | -10-11.  Effect. Seat of Beast
   darkness. Men impenitent.
                                         B^2 |     c | 12-.  The Sixth
   Vial.
                                                             d | -12.
   Effect. Euphrates dried up.
                                                                      e |
   13-16. Things seen. (Three demons like frogs).
           A^3 |     a^5 | 17-.  The Seventh Vial.
                               b^5 | -17-21.  Effect. Earthquake, and
   Great Babylon comes into remembrance (19).


   We have observed above that the 1st and 2nd Vials form a pair, also the
   4th and 5th; and, like the 7th, consist of two parts, viz., the pouring
   out of the Vial and its effect. These three groups are separated by the
   3rd and 6th Vial, which have each three parts. To the pouring out of
   the Vial and its effect is added, in the former case, Things heard; and
   in the latter case, Things seen. The effect of the last (or seventh)
   Vial is to bring up "great Babylon into remembrance"; and this leads on
   naturally and consecutively to the judgment on Babylon in chapters
   xvii. and xviii.

   We now come to the translation.


   The First Vial, and its Effect (xvi. 1, 2).

   The first verse is general and introduces the whole seven.

   xvi. 1. And I heard a loud voice out of the Temple (Naos), saying to
   the Seven Angels,

   "Go forth, and pour out the seven [318] Vials of the fury of God into
   the earth."]

   These seven Vials and their effects we take to be literal; i.e., to be
   exactly what is said of them. They belong to no figures of speech. The
   language is clear and precise. There is nothing beyond our faith,
   though there may be beyond our reason. True, they are supernatural, but
   not unnatural. In the plagues of Egypt, which all take to be literal,
   we have many judgments exactly similar. Indeed, six out of the seven
   Vials are just the same as the plagues of Egypt, and God has again and
   again declared that their final judgments should be like, yea, should
   be worse than those (Ex. xxxiv. 10).

   The first Vial is like the sixth plague, which was of Boils, etc.

   The second and third Vials are like the first plague, when the waters
   became blood.

   The fifth Vial is like the ninth plague, when darkness overspread the
   land.

   The sixth Vial is like the second plague, of frogs.

   The seventh Vial is like the 7th plague, of hail, &c.

   The fourth is the only Vial which has no counterpart in the Egyptian
   plagues; and that is the great "heat." Now, if six out of these seven
   judgments have already been once seen and experienced, why should not
   like plagues be sent again, when it is expressly said that the
   supernatural events connected with Israel's return shall be "like as it
   was ... in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt" (Is. xi.
   16)?

   In the face of this, is it not strange that these Vials should ever be
   taken to mean:

   The first, the French Revolution; and the "sores" its infidelity, &c.

   The second, the naval wars of the French Revolution;

   The third, Napoleon's campaign in Italy;

   The fourth, Napoleon's military tyranny, &c., &c.?

   It is a waste of precious time and space even to chronicle such
   interpretations, which make the Word of God none effect.

   Does any believe that we have passed through the greater part of the
   "great and terrible Day of the Lord" without knowing it; and yet all
   the time preaching the Gospel of God's Grace, instead of proclaiming
   that "the hour of his judgment is come"? Is this really "the day of
   vengeance of our God," and yet Ministers on every hand are telling us
   how the Millennium is actually dawning; and some that it has already
   come -- a Millennium without Christ? No! Bible students, who believe
   what God says; and whose one desire is to understand what He has said,
   can never be satisfied with such confusion as that, which only
   perplexes the mind, instead of enlightening it.

   xvi. 2. And the first went forth, and poured out his Vial into [319]
   the earth; and there broke out a noisome and grievous sore upon [320]
   the men who had the mark (or brand) of the Beast, and upon those who
   were worshipping his image.]      The words "poured out" are more than
   hinted at in Ps. lxxix. 1-6. Lam. iv. 11; and a similar plague had been
   more than once seen before. Ex. ix. 8-12. Job ii. 7, 8. I Sam. v. 6.
   Num. xii. 10.

   Moreover it was one of the judgments threatened to Israel. Deut.
   xxviii. 15, 27, 35. Lev. xxvi. 16.

   The first to suffer on account of this plague are the worshippers of
   the Beast and his Image. These had been warned (xiv. 9-11) that those
   who are engaged in worshipping the Beast (it is the present participle
   both there and here) should have no rest day and night." Here we see
   how this is to be brought about: none can rest who are afflicted with
   these "noisome and grievous sores."


   The Second Vial (xvi. 3)

   xvi. 3. And the second [321] poured out his Vial into the sea: and it
   became blood, as of one dead; and every living soul died that was in
   the sea.]      We may compare this with the second Trumpet (viii. 8)
   and the first Egyptian plague (Ex. vii. 20-25. Compare Ps. cv. 29. Isa.
   l. 2. Nahum i. 2-4). The literal understanding of these plagues makes
   things so clear, that little or no further explanation is necessary.
   They explain to us the nature and effect of these judgments.


   The Third Vial (xvi. 4-7).

   xvi. 4. And the third [322] poured out his Vial into the rivers, and
   [323] the fountains of waters; and they became blood. (5) and I heard
   the angel of the waters saying,

   "Righteous art Thou [324] , who art and wast, [325] Holy [326] art
   Thou, because thou didst judge these things. (6) For they shed the
   blood of saints and prophets, And thou hast given them blood to drink;
   -- [327] They deserve it!"

   (7) And I heard (the angel of) [328] the altar saying,

   "Even so, Lord God, the Almighty, True and righteous are Thy
   judgments."]

   This is Divine comment from heaven on the judgment of the third Vial.
   The expression, "angel of the waters," shows that angels have their
   spheres and offices; that the operations of nature are not left to
   blind chance, but that He who made what men call "the laws of nature"
   has a mighty and capable executive to see that those laws, and God's
   will, are carried out.

   The Altar is either personified (for the prayers of the saints are upon
   it; and the martyrs are beneath it); or the words "[the angel of] the
   Altar" must be supplied. In either case, the emphasis is on "the
   Altar."

   The Angel's words, here, show that they are uttered in another
   dispensation, altogether different from the present dispensation of
   grace; even in the dispensation of retribution and judgment. That
   dispensation to which such passages as Ezek. xxxv. 6 and xvi. 38 refer.

   Just as Matt. xxiii. 34, 35, and Luke xi. 47-51, refer to a day of
   judgment and not of grace. God is "not imputing their trespasses" unto
   His people now, having imputed them all to Christ. This shows that
   unless we rightly divide the Word according to its dispensation, our
   reading of it must be in hopeless confusion.

   The reference of verse 6 ("They have shed the blood of thy prophets,"
   etc.) is evidently to chap. xvii. 6; xiii. 15; xi. 18; and xviii. 20.
   Pss. lxxix. and lxxiv. should be read in this connection.


   The Fourth Vial (xvi. 8, 9).

   xvi. 8. And the fourth [angel [329] ] poured out his Vial upon the Sun;
   and it was given to him to scorch men with fire. (9) And men were
   scorched with vehement heat, and they blasphemed the name of God (i.e.,
   God Himself), who hath authority over these plagues: and they repented
   not, to give Him glory.]     At the sounding of the fourth Trumpet the
   Sun was smitten, but only one third of it. There are to be "signs in
   the sun" (Luke xxi. 25). Isaiah tells of a time when "the inhabitants
   of the earth are burned and few men left" (Isa. xxiv. 6; xlii. 25).
   Compare Mal. iv. 1, which says: "Behold, the day cometh that shall burn
   as an oven; and the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be as
   stubble." The moral effects, here, are a defiance of the demands of the
   angel in xiv. 6, 7. They refuse to "give glory to God." They cry not
   for quarter, nor will quarter be given. Yet men tell us that all we
   have here is the tyranny and oppression of Napoleon!


   The Fifth Vial (xvi. 10, 11).

   xvi. 10. And the fifth [angel [330] ] poured out his Vial upon the
   throne of the Beast: and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed
   their tongues from their pain, (11) and they blasphemed the God of
   heaven because of their pains and their sores (verse 2), and repented
   not and turned not from their works.]      This proves that the Seven
   Assemblies belong, by interpretation to that dispensation of judgment.
   For to the Assembly at Pergamos Christ says: "I know thy works and
   where thou dwellest; where the throne of Satan is, and thou holdest
   fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas,
   my faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth"
   (ii. 13; xiii. 2). So that not only is it clear that those Assemblies
   are on the earth at this time, but that chap. xii. records events prior
   to chap. ii, and that the persecution and martyrdom of chap. xiii. have
   already commenced in the days to which chap. ii. 13 refers. This Vial
   initiates a direct attack on the throne of the Beast, the vice-gerent
   of Satan. He is no more able to defend himself against this plague of
   darkness than Pharaoh was (Ex. x. 21-23). The darkness here referred to
   will be as real as the darkness was in Egypt. Joel prophesied of this
   when he said (ii. 1, 2, 31):

   "The Day of the Lord cometh...
   A day of darkness and of gloominess;
   A day of clouds and thick darkness.
   The sun shall be turned into darkness," etc.

   In Mark xiii. 24, 25, the Saviour said "the sun shall be darkened, and
   the moon shall not give her light."

   Great is the vexation caused by this awful darkness. And yet we are
   asked to believe that this is nothing more than the Suppression of the
   Monasteries, etc., in France, in 1789, by Napoleon.

   Is this what all the prophets have been occupied with? Even symbols
   must symbolise something that is congruous. But, here, the bringing on
   of gross darkness is made to symbolise the suppression of what is the
   cause of darkness! If it were taken to symbolise the setting up of
   monasteries, it would be more relevant. No wonder that darkness has
   come over this book -- when imagination is substituted for faith.


   The Sixth Vial (xvi. 12-16).

   The sixth Vial, like the third (xvi. 4, 5), has three divisions
   (whereas all the others have only two). These three are (1) the pouring
   out, (2) the effect, and (3) things seen. The third Vial was the same,
   except that there we had things heard: and here we have things seen.

   xvi. 12. And the sixth [angel [331] ] poured out his Vial upon the
   great river the [332] Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up,
   that the way of the kings that come from the East might be
   prepared.]      We take this to refer to the actual river Euphrates.
   All else in the chapter is literal; and so is this. There is no reason
   why it should not be so. Those who assert that this means the wane of
   the Turkish Empire say so on their own responsibility. There is not a
   word about it here, and there is nothing to lead us to imagine it;
   especially when we think of the object for which the river is to be
   dried up. The sixth Trumpet has to do with the river Euphrates also.
   The context here, and the "things seen" in connection with this Vial,
   tell us that the kings of the earth are about to be gathered together
   to the great battle in which the Heavenly and Satanic and earthly
   forces are about to be engaged. With the view of preparing for this
   gathering, the way of these kings which are to come from the East, is
   to be prepared. The Vial is connected with judgment, and not with
   mercy; and therefore to interpret these kings of the Ten Tribes, or of
   "Christian princes," or of any propitious or auspicious event, is out
   of all harmony with the whole scope of the context. At the sounding of
   the sixth Trumpet a vast supernatural army is let loose to slay a third
   part of men. Here, under the sixth Vial, a vast human army is gathered
   together, the whole of which is destroyed by God. Moreover, a similar
   effect on the river Euphrates is the subject of another prophecy: "And
   the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with
   His mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river [Euphrates] and
   shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry-shod"
   (Isa. xi. 15).

   Again, "I will bring them also out of the land of Egypt, and gather
   them out of Assyria; and ... the deeps of the river shall dry up; and
   the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt
   shall depart away" (Zech. x. 10, 11).

   The kings from the East journey Westward to Palestine. East and West
   are to be reckoned from the standpoint of the prophecy, and not from
   that of the reader. Here, that standpoint is God's Land and City.

   The Euphrates is indeed a great river, as here stated. It is 1,800
   miles long, and from Mohammarah to the sea it is 3,6000 feet wide and
   30 feet deep. [333] This river is to be dried up for the more easy
   gathering of this infernal Crusade against the Lamb and His host. They
   gather to a scene of slaughter, from which they never return. It is
   this gathering which the Scripture now proceeds to describe to us.

   xvi. 13. And I saw going forth out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out
   of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the False Prophet,
   three unclean spirits, as it were [334] frogs. (14) (For they are demon
   spirits working miracles), which go forth to the kings [335] of the
   whole world to gather them together to the [336] battle of that great
   day of God, the Almighty.]      The Holy Spirit does not say there were
   frogs, but that they seemed to look like frogs. But He actually says
   they were not frogs, and thus not like the plague of frogs in Egypt
   (Ex. viii. 1-14), but "spirits," i.e., demon spirits. They work
   miracles, as does the false prophet (xiii. 13-15. 2 Thess. ii. 9).

   They give apparently convincing evidence of their reality and mission:
   and if thousands could be gathered to the Crusades by a man (like Peter
   the hermit), tens of thousands will be gathered by these wonder-working
   demons, and persuaded to join the advancing hosts against God and His
   saints. We see a similar and real persuasion in 1 Kings xxii. 19-38.
   See Joel iii. 9-11. Ps. ii. 1-3.

   Then we have this interjectional clause, which must be read as a
   parenthesis; for it does not interfere with the course of the prophetic
   events. [337]

   While the demon spirits are gathering the kings and their armies, John
   hears the Voice of Christ, saying:

   [15. "Behold I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
   keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."]

   These words are addressed to those in the other host who have not
   worshipped the Beast or his image, and have not received his mark or
   the number of his name. They receive this encouraging Benediction.
   True, it is "as a thief" He is now coming. This proves that the Church
   of God is not in the judgment scene here described, for the
   Thessalonian believers were positively assured that the day shall NOT
   come on them as a thief (I Thess. v. 4. Compare Matt. xxiv. 38-44. Luke
   xii. 35-40). This blessing is not for us now, in this dispensation of
   grace, even as the assurance is not for us. The Lord is then about to
   come as a thief. Hence this announcement; and hence this blessing.
   Those who will need it will be on the earth at that time, as we learn
   from chap. iii. 3 (compare Mark xiii. 34-37).

   After this Parembole the prophecy proceeds as though it had not been
   interrupted.

   xvi. 16. And they (i.e., the demon spirits of verse 14) gathered them
   (i.e., the kings and their armies) together unto the place which is
   called in Hebrew Har-mageddon [338] ]      This mention of Hebrew
   connects the Apocalypse with the Gospels (See John v. 2; xix. 13, 17.
   So Rev. ix. 11). And in this we have also a reference to the Old
   Testament. The name (...) (har-megiddo) means the mount of Megiddo; and
   the name is ominous as to what the result of this battle will be. For
   there Deborah and Barak destroyed Sisera and his host (Judg. v. 19);
   there King Josiah was overthrown by Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt (2
   Kings xxiii. 29. 2 Chron. xxxv. 22-25). Slaughter and lamentation are
   associated with Megiddo (Zech. xii. 11). In Isa. x. 28, which describes
   the invasion of Anti-Christ, the Septuagint version reads Megiddo.

   Megiddo probably means a place of troops (from (...), gad), a troop
   (Gen. xlix. 19); and the verb (...) (gadad), to cut to pieces. (See
   Deut. xiv. 1. 1 Kings xviii. 28. Jer. xvi. 6; xli. 5. Mic. v. 1). It is
   part of the great plain of Esdraelon. It is a real locality, and the
   transactions yet to take place there will be real also.

   Having gathered the hosts of the enemy thither, the sixth Vial ends.
   The description of the events which took place there is delayed until
   the events of the seventh Vial bring on the final catastrophe in chap.
   xix. There we have the battle itself (xix. 11-18). The sixth vial
   brings us up to the point where everything is seen to be in readiness,
   and then abruptly breaks off so as to allow of our coming up to the
   same point through another course of events, which are brought on by
   the pouring forth of


   The Seventh Vial (xvi. 17-21).

   xvi. 17. And the seventh [angel [339] ] poured his Vial upon [340] the
   air; and there came forth a loud voice out of [341] the Temple
   (Naos),|| from the throne, saying, "It is done."]      i.e., the last
   Vial has been, at length, poured out; the last judgment entered upon;
   the last plague begun. This will end all up and fulfil and accomplish
   all the Divine counsels as to these judgments. Therefore this voice
   comes forth; and this solemn announcement is made, "It is done." The
   Temple is seen at the close of each of the three series of judgments.
   This is the last. In the New Heaven and New Earth there will be no
   Temple (ch. xxi. 22). This is the final act, which chronologically
   brings on the opening of heaven and the coming forth of the Son of God
   Himself to the battle in xix. 11.

   || L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit "of heaven."

   But before that happens we are detained and told of the destruction of
   Babylon and the Empire of the Beast (xvii. and xviii.); and the
   marshalling of the heavenly forces (chap. xix). We are, however, told
   of the commotions in heaven and on earth, which are given in a general
   statement or summary.

   xvi. 18. And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; [342] and
   there was a great earthquake, such as was not since man was on the
   earth, so mighty an earthquake, or so great.]      Similar results take
   place at the opening of the seventh Seal (viii. 5); and at the sounding
   of the seventh Trumpet (xi. 19). This is the great earthquake spoken of
   by the prophets (Ezek. xxxviii. 20. Isa. ii. 19, 21. Hag. ii. 21, 22).

   xvi. 19. And the great city became divided (or split) into three parts,
   and the cities of the nations fell; and great Babylon came into
   remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the
   fierceness of his wrath.]      Not only is great Babylon split up into
   three parts by this earthquake, but the capital cities also of the
   confederated nations, the allies of the Beast (verse 14; xvii. 13-17)
   were destroyed. Some say that "Great Babylon" means "Rome"; others hold
   that it means "Jerusalem"; while others, like ourselves, believe what
   is written. Babel or Babylon was the scene of the first apostasy from
   God after the Flood. Always the enemy of God's people, she became in
   later days the metropolis of the first great Gentile Empire as seen in
   the image and dream of Nebuchadnezzar. God promised to remember His
   covenant with Israel; and when He did so He promised to also to
   remember Babylon in the day of His wrath. Hence His people cry
   concerning it, "Remember, O Lord." Ps. cxxxvii.; xcviii. 3; xv. 8, 42.

   Babylon is only partly destroyed now in token of its total destruction
   soon to follow. One tenth of the city will have fallen, as we are told
   in xi. 12, 13. And chapters xvii. and xviii. are going to tell us of
   the causes, and of the manner, and the consequences of that judgment.

   xvi. 20. And every island fled away, and certain mountains were not
   found. (21) And a great hail, as of a talent's weight, falleth out of
   heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the
   hail; because the plague thereof is exceedingly great.]      The
   judgments increase in their severity. In chap. vi. 14, the mountains
   and islands were moved. Here, they flee. By and by the whole earth and
   heaven will flee away, and no place be found for them. There is no
   article before mountains, so we have supplied its absence by the word
   "certain." Had every mountain been meant the article would have been
   used. Mountains will exist during the millennium. (See Ps. lxxii. 3,
   16; cxlviii. 9. Isa. ii. 2; xliv. 23. Ezek. xxxvi. 8). The plague of
   hail in Egypt was real (Ex. ix. 18-21). So is this. Why not? The stones
   are indeed great in size. A Jewish talent was 114 lbs. troy weight.
   Josephus says that stones of a talent's weight were thrown by the
   Romans against Jerusalem (Wars iii. vii. 9). Surely God can send from
   heaven what man could send on earth.

   M. Huc says, in his Travels in Tartary [343] : "Hail is of frequent
   occurrence in these unhappy districts, and the dimensions of the
   hailstones are generally enormous. We have seen some that weighed
   twelve pounds. One moment sometimes suffices to exterminate whole
   flocks. In 1843, during one of these storms, there was heard in the air
   a sound as of a rushing wind, and therewith fell in a field near a
   house, a mass of ice larger than an ordinary millstone. It was broken
   to pieces with hatchets; yet though the sun burned fiercely, three days
   elapsed before these pieces entirely melted."

   Hail had been before one of God's engines of war, beyond the use or
   defence of man. (See chap. xi. 19. Ex. ix. 22-26. Ps. lxxviii. 47; cv.
   32. Josh. x. 11). And they are the tokens of Divine wrath. (See Isa.
   xxx. 30. Ezek. xiii. 11).

   No wonder the blasphemy that follows from the worshippers of the Beast,
   impenitent to the end, will also be exceeding great.

   This concludes the great Judgments of the Seven Vials recorded in chap.
   xvi. We come now to chap. xvii., the Judgment of the great Harlot.


   W. Chap. xviii. The Great Harlot.

   This is the second of the three great divisions of the sixth Vision "on
   Earth." We have shown them as follows:--

   The 1st (chap. xvi). The great Judgments.
   The 2nd (chap. xvii). The great Harlot.
   The 3rd (chap. xviii). The great City.

   It is the first of these which we have just completed; and we pass on
   to the second -- in chap. xvii. -- which, perhaps more than any other,
   has caused the widest gulf between the various schools of expositors.
   It is one of the most prominent of all the subjects of which the
   Apocalypse treats. Indeed, taken with the eighteenth chapter, which is
   part of the same Vision (the 6th "on Earth"), it is the most
   conspicuous prophecy of this book. None of the current expositions are
   sufficiently consistent or satisfying. Preterist Expositors differ
   among themselves as to whether "great Babylon" means the City of Rome,
   or the Church of Rome: Rome Pagan or Rome Papal. But, if this is all
   that these solemn chapters mean, we may well say with Dr. Seiss, "If we
   cannot find more solid ground than that on which the Rome theory rests,
   we must needs consign the whole subject to the department of doubt and
   uncertainty; and let all these tremendous foreshadowings pass for
   nothing." [344]

   But we shall best accomplish our object by keeping to the Text of the
   Word itself; learning its scope from its structure; and giving its
   translation.

   No current theory takes in the whole scope. One or two points are
   seized upon, and treated quite out of all proportion to the rest; while
   others, quite as essential, are passed over slightly, or ignored
   altogether. Any satisfying interpretation must take in the whole of
   what is written; and must treat each part, not as though it were in the
   way, or inconvenient, but as though it were indispensable.

   The chapter itself is divided into two parts; (i.) the Vision, and
   (ii.) its Interpretation.

   W. Chap. xvii.  The Great Harlot.

   W |     Y | xvii. 1-6.  The Vision.
              Z | xvii. 7-18.  The Interpretation.

   And first expanding "W," The Vision (xvii. 1-6), we find it is
   constructed as follows:--

    Y. xvii. 1-6.  The Vision.

   Y |     C |     f | xvii. 1-.  Place:  "Hither."
                              g | -1-.  The great harlot.
                                      h | -1.  Her seat.
                                              i | 2.  Her accomplices.
            C |     f | 3-.  Place:  "Wilderness."
                              g | -3-.  The woman.
                                      h | -3.  Her seat.
                                              i | 4-6.  Herself.

   xvii. 1. And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven
   Vials,]      Which of the seven we are not told; but it was probably
   the last; inasmuch as it was the pouring forth of his Vial that brought
   Great Babylon into remembrance before God.

   and talked with me, saying [345]

   "Come hither; I will show to thee the judgment of the great harlot,
   that sitteth upon many waters: (2) With whom the kings of the earth
   committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk
   with the wine of her fornication."]

   We have before observed, that when symbols are used in this book they
   are generally explained by the Holy Spirit Himself. When this is not
   the case, we must, of course, use our best judgment and compare other
   Scriptures, so as to see, as far as we can, what the symbol means. But,
   when He does tell us what the symbols mean, we are not left in any
   doubt or uncertainty. We cannot go wrong if we keep to the
   interpretation which the Spirit Himself gives. We are not to
   re-interpret His interpretation; or to further explain His explanation.
   If so, we should be treating the Divine interpretation as though it
   were another symbol. This, therefore, we may not do; but we are to
   accept it, and believe it, and rest on it.

   Now, in this chapter, the Spirit has been pleased to give us His own
   interpretation of the Vision. We have seen how this is emphasised in
   the structure, which is expressly divided into these two parts. We have
   marked them

   "Y" (verses 1-6), which is the Vision, and
   "Z" (verses 7-18), which is the Interpretation.

   These two are again subdivided in a similar and corresponding manner.
   Each is introduced by a Promise ("C" verses 1, 2 and "D", "E" verse 7);
   and is followed by the Performance of that promise ("C" verses 3-6 and
   "E", "D" verses 8-18). See the structure of "Y" and "Z".

   In this manner has the Holy Spirit called our attention to His
   interpretation, and impressed its importance upon us.

   If we follow this, all will be easy and plain.

   Indeed, it will be better to give the structure of the Interpretation
   (verses 7-18) here, and now, and incorporate the two together, in order
   that the one may elucidate the other; and, that we may thus use both to
   greater profit.

   Z. xvii. 7-18.  The Interpretation of the Vision.

   Z |     D | 7-.  The Woman.
                    E | -7.  The Beast.
                    E | 8-17.  The Beast.
            D | 18.  The Woman.

   The member E (verses 8-17) will require expansion later on; together
   with the special consideration for which the structure of that member
   calls.

   Now, there is a well-known principle which is often practised in
   algebra with great advantage in the solution of a problem; and that is,
   where one things represents another, to express that one in the terms
   of the other.

   The same principle may be followed here, where we have the Vision and
   the Divinely-given interpretation. We will re-write the Vision in the
   terms of the interpretation: i.e., instead of putting what John saw, we
   will put the explanation at once, and thus bring the whole more clearly
   before our minds.

   We will, therefore, do this, using two different kinds of type to make
   the matter more clear and enable us to distinguish what is the symbolic
   prophecy, and what is the Divine interpretation. Thus we shall
   introduce the interpretation given in the latter part of the chapter,
   and substitute it (in italic type) for the symbols used in the former
   part of the chapter, thus:

   verse 1. "Come hither: I will show to thee the judgment of that great
   City that reigneth over the kings of the earth (verse 18), and over
   peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues (verse 15), with whom
   the kings of the earth have practised idolatry, [346] and the
   inhabitants of the earth have been made to partake of HER idolatrous
   worship."

   This, of course, characterised the worship of Pagan Rome, but cannot
   truly be said of Papal Rome, of which this chapter is commonly
   interpreted. But inasmuch as this was the mark of all the heathen
   nations, it does not, of itself, identify this city with Pagan Rome:
   for it is a city, the Spirits says (verse 18).

   3. And he (i.e., the angel) carried me away by the spirit]      as in
   chap. i. 10, upon which passage it throws great light. (...) (en
   pneumati) means by the spirit, or by spiritual power, as in i. 10; iv.
   2; xxi. 10. Acts viii. 26, 29, 39.

   into the [347] wilderness; and I saw a woman]      i.e, that great city
   (verse 18).

   sitting upon a scarlet beast]      i.e., supported by that being who is
   described in verses 8-11.

   full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns]      Now
   we must treat this verse as we have treated verses 1, 2 above, and
   express the vision in the terms of the interpretation:

   -3. "And I saw that great city which reigneth over the kings of the
   earth (verse 18), supported by the Beast full of blasphemous names
   which was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and
   go into perdition (verse 8), even he who is the eighth king, and is of
   the seven (verse 11), having seven kings (verse 10), which support that
   great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth (verses 9, 18);
   and ten kings which are contemporaneous and which have received no
   kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings at one and the same time
   with the Beast (verse 12), who is the eighth king (verse 11), that was,
   and is not, and shall be present" (verse 8).

   Now, from this, is it not clear that we are dealing not with
   world-powers in the successive or mortal stage, but with individuals in
   their contemporaneous and superhuman form?

   It is very important for us to note this important fact, which is vital
   to the understanding of the whole Vision and its Divinely-given
   interpretation.

   Our business is not to interpret the Vision. That is done for us. What
   we have to do is first to believe what God says, and then to try and
   understand it.

   The world-powers of Dan. ii. are then seen in their mortal stage, and
   hence are seen in their successive existence, in which they were rival
   powers. In Rev. xiii. and xvii. they are seen in their superhuman
   stage, and they then form one vast colossal Power, having absolute
   dominion in the world. In Dan. vii. 26, this Power is seen judged as a
   whole, and goes down into perdition. Dan. vii. 26 treats of the
   superhuman stage as do chapters xiii., xvii., here.

   The Beast receives his deadly wound in his mortal stage, previous to
   going down into the Abyss. He comes up with the other heads and ten
   horns. All come together and are seen together in their superhuman
   form.

   Chapter xii. when compared with chap. xiii. and xvii. shows that there
   are two great confederacies treated of -- the Heavenly and the Earthly
   -- and they are not identical.

   There is the Dragon Confederacy of seven heavenly dominions with their
   ten armies. This is a Confederacy of evil angels with Satan at their
   head (chap. xii).

   The other Confederacy is of mortals who went down into the Abyss, and
   come up a superhuman Confederacy on the earth (chaps. xiii. and xvii).

   Angels form the Confederacy under Satan in the heavens.

   Superhuman men form the Confederacy under the Beast on earth.

   These Confederacies are distinct from each other.

   What we are told of the Beast in xvii. 4, concerns his relation to
   Babylon.

   xvii. 4. And the woman (i.e., the great city, verse 18) was arrayed in
   purple (Judg. viii. 26. Est. i. 6), and scarlet, and bedecked with gold
   and precious stone and pearls, having a golden cup (Jer. li. 7) in her
   hand full of abominations and having the unclean things of her
   fornication:]

   Again we must present the vision of this verse in terms of the
   interpretation:

   4. And that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth
   (verse 18) was beautified with purple and scarlet, and adorned with
   gold and precious stone, and pearls, having a wondrous and attractive
   idolatrous system full of abominations, and having the unclean
   provisions for her idolatrous practices."

   That great city is described as having all luxuries, combined with her
   idolatrous worship. The word "Abomination" is used of an idol (see 2
   Kings xxiii. 13. Is. xliv. 19); and in the plural, of idolatry (see
   Deut. xviii. 9; xxix. 17; xxxii. 16. 1 Kings xiv. 24. 2 Kings xvi. 3;
   xxi. 2; xxiii. 24. So Ezek.. viii. 6, 9, 13, 15, 17; xi. 18; xiv. 6;
   xvi. 2; xx. 7, 8). Doubtless the idols and idolatry were so called,
   because of the uncleanness practised in their worship. Can we doubt
   that when we meet with the word here in Rev. xvii. 4, 5, we have the
   same idolatrous uncleanliness referred to?

   5. And upon her forehead a name written, -- a secret sign.]      By
   printing (on its own authority) the word "mystery" in large capital
   letters, the AV. has made it appear as part of the name. The Revisers
   have followed this example, printing the name in small capitals instead
   of large. But they have, in the margin, said "or, a mystery, BABYLON
   THE GREAT," as though the word "mystery" did not form part of the
   title. We believe this to be the case, and we further believe that what
   follows the word "great" does not form any part of this "name," but is
   the Divine meaning and description of it.

   So we read it, that she had a name written on her forehead -- a secret
   symbol --

   "BABYLON THE GREAT," the mother of the harlots and of the abominations
   of the earth.]      Written on the woman's forehead, it was a secret
   sign or symbol. It does not mean that she or any woman could be so
   described. But that, as the explanation of what the woman represented
   is deferred till the very last verse of the chapter, the meaning of the
   name was a secret, till it was then and there revealed that it referred
   to "that great city" (verse 18), and not to an individual woman, or to
   any human being.

   The word (...) (musterion) means simply a secret. It occurs in the
   Septuagint (280 B.C.) only nine times, of the king's secret which had
   gone from him (Dan. ii. 18, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 47 (twice), and iv. 9).
   See also its usage in the Apocryphal books in the same sense. [348] But
   the Greek Christian fathers used the word of any such sign, whether of
   words or actions. They spoke of the offering of Isaac as a musterion:
   i.e., a sign or symbol of the secret purpose of God concerning His Son,
   Jesus Christ. And they used it interchangeably with the words (...)
   (tupose) type; (...) (sumbolon), symbol, and (...) (parabole) parable.

   The meaning of the word mystery, therefore, here in Rev. xvii. 5, 7,
   must have this later signification which the word had acquired. We give
   a few examples in a note. [349] And others might be cited, but these
   will be sufficient to show us how the word mystery had, at that time,
   come to be practically synonymous with symbol. Perhaps secret sign
   would be express it; and this was the usage of the word when this
   Revelation was given to John. Hence, in this book, we must give the
   word this signification.

   In Rev. i. 20, the seven stars are used as a secret sign for something
   which they signified (So also Eph. v. 32).

   So here, in xvii. 5, 6, the woman's name is a secret sign; and refers
   to something much deeper than the name itself could convey. The name
   was the name, not of a woman, but of a city, "that great city," even
   Babylon. But it signified not merely the material city as such, but the
   vast system of idolatry connected with it. That is why the explanation
   of the secret sign follows "the mother of the harlots and of the
   abominations of the earth." Not merely of Rome, or even Babylon (as a
   city), but "of the earth": i.e., the mother, or fountain-head of all
   the systems of idolatry which have since flooded "the earth" from that
   one great source; and of which Romanism is only a part.

   This is the secret of "mystery of iniquity" referred to in 2 Thess. ii.
   7.

   Babylon was the fountain-head of all idolatry.

   We have here two things, (1) the reality, which is that "great city,"
   which will be seen by the uninitiated; and (2) the woman, which is the
   "secret sign" of what it means.

   The picture of the woman, as described, may be regarded as the
   "drop-curtain." But the initiated are those who will be admitted behind
   it, and learn "the depths of Satan:" and, behind the scenes in his own
   great theatre, will learn what Satan's religion means as they "worship
   the Dragon."

   The uninitiated will see only the curtain-- the wonderful city. Compare
   Prov. ix. 13-18, where both are shown and may well be applied to the
   passage here.

   Idolatry was no mere sin into which people gradually sunk; but it was
   the creation, by Satanic wisdom, of a mighty system, which he intended
   to us, and to lead up to his own worship.

   Nimrod was used as the great founder of this marvellous scheme of
   Satan. Babylon was his city (Gen. x. 10). Would not Cain's city before
   the flood answer to the people of that day, the same end as Babylon did
   afterwards (Gen. iv. 17)? Each would be the capital of their respective
   idolatrous systems. The words "Cain went out from the presence of the
   Lord" are very significant. So is the name of Cain's city. He called it
   "Enoch," which means initiated. [350] The corruption of mankind spoken
   of in Gen. vi. must have led to abnormal forms, which would account for
   the half-human, or super-human beings, which became the Nephilim, the
   Rephaim, and Anakim of Scripture; the Titans of the Greeks. It would
   account for the worship of Ishtar, Isis, Ashtaroth, and all the
   abominations of spiritual harlotry.

   We thus see how "that great city," Babylon, founded by Nimrod, was the
   source of all idolatry.

   This is not true of Rome. Pagan Rome itself was only one system; one of
   the polluted streams from that corrupt source. Papal Rome is only
   another single stream. It is not possible that a part can be the whole!
   It is not possible that one of many streams can be the fountain-head of
   all streams. Was there no idolatry before Pagan Rome? Whence then came
   the worship of "Moloch" and "Remphan," and "Chium," in the wilderness
   (Acts vii. 43. Amos v. 25, 26); and the worship of Ashtoreth, the
   abomination (i.e., idol) of the Zidonians, and Chemosh, the abomination
   of the Moabites, and Milcom, the abomination of the children of Ammon,
   which were introduced by Solomon (1 Kings xi. 5. 2 Kings xxiii. 11)?
   Was Rome the mother of these? The description here goes back to the
   origin of all the abominations of heathen idolatry. Rome's place in
   history makes this an absolute impossibility. It would be just as
   absurd to say that the Zionist movement of to-day was the source or the
   mother of the Jewish nation!

   Just as impossible was it for the Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar's day; and
   for the same reason. It does not date back far enough. We must go
   farther back, and find it in Gen. x. 8-10 and xi. 9. There we find it
   in the land of Shinar. Under Nimrod began the work in the spirit of
   Anti-christ; his object being to build a city, and make for his People
   a name, so that they might not be scattered. Babylon was founded in
   rebellion against God. Nimrod was "a mighty one on the earth" (Gen. x.
   8). He called his city Bab-El. [351] Some take this to mean the court
   or gate of God; for he, like his antitype, would fain thus exalt
   himself (2 Thess. ii. 4).

   Others derive it from Belus, the name of the principal idol of the
   Babylonians. Sometimes written Bel (...). If so, Babel would mean --
   for Bel or of Bel.

   In any case we are taken back to the fountain-head, and shown the
   source and origin of all idolatry. Nimrod is called a mighty hunter.
   [352] The Targum of Jonathan (an ancient Jewish commentary) interprets
   this to mean that he was a mighty rebel before the Lord. The Jerusalem
   Targum reads it as meaning mighty in sin, lying in wait to catch and
   overthrow men; drawing them away from the worship of the true God, as
   taught by Shem, to join that taught by Nimrod. Hence, his name became a
   proverb for any great rebel or Apostate. (Read Gen. x. 9).

   It is equally impossible to interpret the words of Rome -- and to say
   that this woman made "the inhabitants of the earth drunk with the wine
   of her fornication," i.e., made the whole earth partake of her
   idolatrous system. Neither of Rome, papal or pagan, can this be said.
   They both drank of her cup; but it is a perversion of all known
   history, to say that either of them was the tutor of all the nations;
   and an insult to common sense to apply this to "the inhabitants of the
   earth for more that 3,000 years before Rome was dreamt of." As Dr.
   Seiss well puts it, this wine "was already bottled and labelled before
   the first dispersion. [Gen. xi.]. It went with that dispersion into
   every country and nation under heaven. As a matter of fact we find it
   to this day among all the nations of the earth; affecting, if not
   controlling their thinking, their politics, their faith, and their
   worship. Not less than two-thirds of the population of the earth at
   this hour are Pagan idolators, drivilling under the same old
   intoxication which came forth from Nimrod and Babylon; whilst the great
   body of the other third is either Mohammedan, Catholic, Jewish,
   Infidel, or adherents of some tainted and anti-christian faith and
   worship. Nor is there a kingdom or government on the face of the whole
   earth at this hour which does not embody and exhibit more of the spirit
   of Nimrod than of the spirit, commandments, and inculcations of God.
   All the kings of the earth, and all the governments under heaven, have
   more or less joined in the uncleanness of that same old Babylonian
   Harlot who had defiled every spot and nook of the whole inhabited
   world, notwithstanding that God from the beginning set His seal of
   wrath upon it. The Jewish whoredoms, and the Papal whoredoms, and the
   Mohammedan whoredoms, and the whoredoms of all perverted Christian
   religionists, though not entirely letting go the confession of one only
   God, are still, in essence, the same old harlotry which first found
   place and embodiment on the banks of the Euphrates. It is the same old
   Babylon, and her harlot daughters, bearing rule or kingdom upon the
   dominions of the earth, and intoxicating the inhabitants thereof out of
   the wine of her fornication." [353]

   It is indeed surprising how any mistake could have been made in the
   identification of this woman. For the Holy Spirit first shows us her
   very name upon her forehead. Then, in verse 18, He tells us as plainly
   as words can tell anything, that "the woman which thou sawest is that
   great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth"; and chap. xvi.
   19, as well as xvii. 5, identifies this city with Babylon. God says it
   is a "city." He does not say a system or a religion, but a "CITY."

   Now, when the Vision is a "Woman"; and God tells us that He means by
   the woman "that great city," Is it legitimate for us to treat this
   again as another symbol, and say it is not the city He says it is, but
   another?

   There is no limit to such a process as that. We may go on to say that
   Rome means London, and that London means some other place. Why not be
   content with the explanation which God has Himself given? instead of
   taking the solemn responsibility of saying that His explanation is no
   explanation at all; and that it means something else. We are not saying
   there are no symbols: We are not saying that Jerusalem is not called
   Sodom. It is; but God leaves us in no doubt as to what He says and what
   He means. That is one thing: but it is quite another thing when we
   treat His own interpretation of a symbol, as though it were only
   another symbol which is left for us to interpret.

   It is not that we wish in any degree to minimise the awful abominations
   of Romanism. None can have a greater abhorrence of them than we have.
   We see in it one of the most filthy of all the streams that have flowed
   from Babylon; but we do try to rise above the level of "a Local Board"
   when we are dealing with God's account of how He is going to close His
   great controversy with Jew and Gentile, with Earth and Hell. Our survey
   must extend beyond the Tiber. We must see something beyond
   Protestantism and Romanism. These do not make up the whole history of
   the Universe, either in time or extent.

   There are many other absurdities connected with the current
   interpretations, which we shall notice as we proceed further into this
   chapter, and consider the Divine interpretation there given of the
   Vision as a whole. There is one point, however, to be referred to here,
   and that is "the cup." It is "golden"; and hence, beautiful and
   attractive in appearance. The cup is one. This tells us that the
   corrupt streams which flow from this one fountain-head are all one in
   essence, and character, and effect. It is the religion originally
   instituted at Babylon, by Nimrod, at the instigation of Satan. (See
   Appendix).

   It is seen in all the great religions of the world. They are all alike
   in substituting another God for the God of the Bible: a God, made
   either with the hands or with the imagination; but equally made. And a
   religion consisting of human merit. These things are common to all
   systems of false Religion, and unite them in one. True, some of the
   rivers from this corrupt source are great and mighty; others are in
   smaller streams, but their waters are one, and the cup is one. Those
   who say that this "cup" means the cup used in the Mass, furnish us with
   a good example of the value of all such interpretations. We have only
   to remember concerning this "cup," here, that all nations are made to
   drink of it; while the one great characteristic of the Romish "cup" in
   the Mass is that it is withheld from the people!

   6. And I saw the woman (i.e., the great city, verse 18) drunken with
   the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus:
   and I wondered when I saw her, with great wonder.]

   Here again we must express the Vision in the terms of the Divine
   Interpretation.

   6. And I saw that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth
   (verse 18) drenched with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of
   the Martyrs of Jesus: and I wondered when I saw the city, with a great
   wonder.

   Here we have another reference to the martyrdoms which will take place
   during the time covered by the Apocalypse.

   They are referred to also in chap. xiii. 7. Dan. vii. 21; xi. 7; xii.
   1, 7.

   The Psalms, also, connect these martyrdoms with the future "times of
   trouble" under the rule of the Beast:

   "O God, keep not thou silence:
   Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
   For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
   And they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
   They take crafty counsel against thy people,
   And consult together against thy hidden ones.
   They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
   That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
   For they have consulted together with one consent;
   Against thee do they make a covenant. (Ps. lxxxiii. 1-5, RV.)

   The Psalm then goes on to speak of a ten-kingdom confederacy similar to
   that which we have in Rev. xvii.

   Psalm lxxix. also speaks of that same time.

   "O God, the heathen (or nations) are come into thine inheritance;
   Thy holy temple have they defiled;
   They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
   The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the
   fowls of the heaven,
   The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
   Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
   And there was none to bury them. (verses 1-3, RV.)

   That many martyrs -- very many -- have been killed at the hands of the
   Church of Rome, if not in the city of Rome itself, none can deny.

   But these are not "ALL that have been slain on the earth" as martyrs.
   Myriads of martyrs for God and His truth were slain, as such, hundreds
   of years before Rome ever had a Pope. The "prophets" of the Old
   Testament were dead, and many had been slain as martyrs centuries
   before Rome existed, whether Papal or Pagan.

   Rome, whatever may be her guilt in this matter, cannot be charged with
   "all" the martyrdom of the ages. All persecution can be traced up to
   false religion. False religion has ever been possessed of a persecuting
   spirit from the day that Cain slew his brother Abel; and Rome, as one
   of the largest streams from the Babylonian fountain of corruption, has
   slain her full quota, for which she is verily guilty, and will share in
   the judgment when "the cities of the nations fall." But not all the
   martyrs have yet been slain. Many passages in this books show us that
   the days of the coming Great Tribulation will fill up the measure of
   Babylon's bloodguiltiness. (See chap. vi. 9-11; xi. 7, 8; xii. 13, 17;
   xiii. 7; xviii. 24; xx. 4). The same future period of martyrdoms is
   prophesied of or referred to in the Psalms. (See Ps. ix; x; lxxix. 2,
   3; xliv. 22; xciv. 5. Also in Dan. vii. 21, 25; viii. 27; xi. 33, 35).
   All these passages should be carefully read and noted. If these Old
   Testament passages do not speak of the same future time spoken of in
   the Apocalypse, to what period can they be referred? When they are read
   together they form one harmonious whole; but, if they are not rightly
   divided according to their respective dispensations, all will be, and
   cannot but be, confusion.

   We come, now, to the Interpretation of this Vision (seen by John in
   xvii. 1-6) which is given to us by Divine inspiration.

   We have seen the structure of both the Vision and the Interpretation.
   As the latter is very brief we may repeat it here.

   Z. xvii. 7-18.  The Interpretation of the Vision.

   Z |     D | 7-.  The Woman.
                    E | -7.  The Beast.
                    E | 8-17.  The Beast.
            D | 18.  The Woman.

   We are struck with the gracious words of the Interpreting Angel. "I
   will tell thee the secret sign of the woman and the wild Beast" (verse
   7). This being so, we are made independent of human interpreters, for
   God has sent and signified it to us by His special angelic messenger.
   In fact, we are, here, really placed on the same level as the Apostle
   John himself. No further explanation than this was given to him by the
   angelic interpreter. Therefore, we, in reading his words, have exactly
   what John had himself: no less and no more. Oh for grace and wisdom to
   understand his words!

   7. And the angel said to me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell
   thee the secret (i.e., the meaning of the secret sign) of the woman,
   and of the Beast that carrieth her, that hath the seven heads and the
   ten horns]       We have the promise, as shown by the structure (verse
   7); and in the rest of the chapter (verse 8-18) we have the performance
   of the promise. The woman and the Beast are first mentioned in brief;
   and then the explanation is given in full, the order being inverted.
   First the Beast is explained, and then the Woman. Ten verses (8-17) are
   given to the former, and only one (verse 18) to the latter; so that the
   Beast is now, evidently, the more important of the two subjects.

   We shall have to expand the member consisting of this longer structure
   concerning "the Beast," marked E. in the above structure.

   E. xvii. 8-17.  The Beast.

   E |     F^1 |     k^1 | xvii. 8.  The Beast (His origin and history).
                               l^1 | 9, 10.  His confederates (the seven
   heads or kings).
            F^2 |     k^2 | 11.  The Beast (further history).
                              l^2 | 12.  His confederates (the ten horns;
   their hour "with the Beast").
            F^3 |     k^3 | 13.  The Beast (power of horns given to him).
                              l^3 | 14-17.  His confederates (their war
   "with the Lamb").


   It will be seen from this Structure that the Interpretation of the
   Vision concerning the Beast (E. xvii. 8-17) consists of three pairs,
   the Beast alternating with his Confederates:--

   F^1 (8-10) gives the first pair.
   F^2 (11, 12) gives the second pair.
   F^3 (13-17) gives the third pair.

   In order to understand the words of the Interpretation here given, it
   would be well if we could forget all that we have ever heard from man
   on this subject. We find even ourselves hampered at every turn by what
   we have learned from tradition. Not until we can divest ourselves of
   all traditional interpretations can we hope to understand the
   interpretation given us in these verses.

   The Structure shows us that "the Beast" and his confederates are the
   two subjects with which we have to do. They are arranged in the form of
   a repeated alternation; and are given in three pairs.

   If we keep these before us we shall be able to distinguish them as we
   proceed.


   F^1. xvii. 8-10. The first pair.

   8. The Beast which thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to ascend
   out of the Abyss, and to go [354] into perdition: and those who dwell
   on the earth shall wonder, whose name [355] is not written in the book
   of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the Beast;
   because he was, and is not, and shall be present. [356] ] These three
   notes as to time (twice given in this verse), mark off for us, as
   clearly as possible, most important and significant points necessary to
   the interpretation.

   The Beast is he who "hath the seven heads and the ten horns" (verse 7).
   The word "hath" refers to the ten horns equally with the seven heads.
   The seven are therefore contemporary with the ten.

   In their mortal stage of being, the seven kings were successive. But
   that mortal stage is referred to in Daniel, not in Revelation.

   In chap. xiii., the Beast comes up out of the Abyss, and is therefore,
   clearly, superhuman. During the first half of the week he is in his
   mortal stage. In the last half he is in his superhuman stage; for in
   chap. xiii. 3, he is seen as having been "wounded to death." But, here,
   in chap. xvii., we are taken back, and are further informed as to the
   past, present, and future of the Beast,

   (1) He "WAS," in his mortal stage.
   (2) He "IS NOT," for he (at the point of time to which the vision
   refers) had been assassinated: i.e., had "received his deadly wound,"
   by which he was "wounded to death," and died (xiii. 3).
   (3) He "SHALL BE PRESENT," for he "is about to ascend out of the
   Abyss."

   This eighth verse therefore refers to the mid-career of the Beast; and
   the point of the vision is the moment between the mortal and the
   superhuman stages: i.e., between chaps. xii. and xiii.

   In the ninth verse the previous mortal stage of the seven heads are
   spoken of. In that stage they were successive; but in their superhuman
   stage they will be contemporary.

   We have already seen that the seven heads or kings are individuals; and
   that the Beast himself, when revived from the dead, will be "the
   eighth" king. We believe that all the confusion, and all the divergent
   opinions on this chapter arise from ignoring this simple fact, and from
   looking at these as kingdoms instead of "kings"; and as world-powers
   instead of individuals.

   Moreover, further confusion has been introduced by taking the words of
   the interpreting angel (in verse 10) as referring to the time of his
   speaking to John; instead of, as in all other cases, as referring to
   the time of or stage in the fulfilment of the vision. In other words,
   the expressions "was and is not" (verses 8, 11), and "one is and the
   other is not yet come" (verse 10), are taken as referring to the moment
   when the angel was actually speaking to John.

   But why not take it, as in all the other cases, as referring to the
   time when the vision shall be accomplished?

   The words of the souls under the altar (chap. vi. 9-11) are regarded as
   spoken at the time when the fifth seal shall be opened. The cry to the
   rocks "Fall on us" will be uttered under the sixth seal. The angel
   himself states (verse 1) that the vision is the future judgment of that
   great city. When the present time is thus used in prophetic language it
   refers to the future time which is spoken of as being present, and not
   to the time when the prophecy was written or spoken.

   We have seen, throughout, that this whole book refers to "the Day of
   the Lord." It is in that day that the Beast will be manifested in his
   superhuman form with his seven heads and ten kings. At the future point
   of time spoken of in verse 10, five of these kings will, as to their
   mortal stage, at that moment "have fallen" (i.e., have been removed by
   violent death [357] ); one of the kings (the sixth) will be reigning;
   and the seventh will not at that juncture have yet come. When he shall
   have come ((...), elthe) he will first overthrow the last three of the
   seven (Dan. vii. 8); but will remain only for the first half of the
   seven years, or thereabouts, in his mortal stage (xvii. 10); for he
   will then receive a deadly wound (by assassination probably), xiii. 3,
   and afterwards be brought to life by Satanic power, have his deadly
   wound healed, and become the "eighth" king. In his mortal stage he is
   the seventh head; but in his superhuman stage he is the eighth king.

   All is thus intensely individual. Who the five kings will be, as to
   their mortal stage; or who the sixth will be, we know not; nor is it
   necessary for our understanding of the Vision. Who the seventh will be,
   we do know; for it is the Beast in his mortal stage, "the little horn"
   of Daniel's Visions. He will be in his superhuman stage, "the eighth"
   king -- the final embodiment of Satanic power, whose doings are
   described in chap. xiii.

   The ten kings of verses 12-17 are not successive in their mortal stage;
   they will be contemporary when they form an integrant part of the
   Beast. The seven heads and the ten horns, with the necessary members
   which go to make up the leopard, the bear, and the lion parts of the
   beast as an organised body, as shown in chap. xiii. 2, are all
   superhuman, all contemporary, have all passed through the mortal stage,
   and have all suffered the first death, so that afterwards they can
   altogether be "cast alive into a lake of fire," which is the second
   death (see chap. xix. 20).

   It is well to remember that "the time of the end" (Dan. vii.) takes in
   the full extent of the Gentile Dominion. "The end time" (Dan. viii. 23)
   is the end of this "time of the end"; the Sunteleia or Consummation.
   While "The last days" (xi. 21) is the Telos, the crisis of "the end
   time."

   The Sunteleia or "End-time," commencing immediately on the removal of
   the Church of God, may run into thirty or forty years; and of these,
   the last "week" of Daniel (ix. 27) will be the last seven.

   This allows all the prophetic periods marked off in 42 months, 1,260
   days, and 3 1/2 years, to be taken as literal months, days, and years,
   if we understand them as falling within these last seven years which
   form the crisis, and end up with the final judgment.

   If the period referred to under the word "hour" (one and the same hour,
   or time) of xvii. 12 and of iii. 10 be the same as the 42 months, then
   this "day of vengeance" of Isa. lxi. 2 may be these 42 months.

   The term kings and kingdoms are used interchangeably in Daniel. The
   kingdoms of Dan. ii. 37, 39, 40, 42, are spoken of as "these kings" in
   verse 44, and so elsewhere.

   But in looking for them we must note four very great and important
   governing principles which will be a sure and certain guide in our
   understanding of this matter. They are these:--

   (1) Israel and Israel's Messiah: in other words, God's Anointed, God's
   Land, God's City, God's People, form the great centre around which all
   prophecy circles.

   (2) Jerusalem is also the centre of the points of the compass. East and
   west, North and South, are to be reckoned from Jerusalem, or from the
   standpoint of the writer: and not from that of the reader; or from any
   other astronomical or geographical arbitrary position.

   (3) The "Heads" denote headship over the People, the City, and the Land
   of Israel.

   (4) The world-powers or kingdoms of prophecy are reckoned only as they
   come into connection with, or into possession of, Israel's Land, and
   City.

   In these four simple propositions we shall find the key to the
   understanding of the Vision and its interpretation.

   The nations were originally formed with reference to Israel; for we are
   expressly told, in the wondrous "Song of Moses," that "when the Most
   High (the title that relates to dominion in the Earth) divided to the
   nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set
   the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of
   Israel" (Deut. xxxii. 8). The nations were not divided by chance;
   neither were the stars of heaven; for in Deut. iv. 19 it says "the Lord
   thy God divided them unto all the nations under the heaven."

   Many nations are mentioned in the Bible; but only those are the subject
   of Divine history and prophecy which have relation to Israel; and even
   these, in proportion to the closeness and extent of that relation. For
   example, the monuments show us the large numbers of Dynasties and
   Kings, etc. there were in Egypt. But only those come into the Word of
   God which had to do with Israel. Many have been, and are, perplexed
   because of this Biblical silence as to the ancient kingdoms of Egypt
   and Assyria, etc.; but this great principle explains it. The Pharaoahs
   of the Oppression and the Exodus would never have been more than mere
   names but for their connection with Moses and Israel. "Pharoah, king of
   Egypt, is but a noise" (Jer. xlvi. 17) -- a noise that is heard for a
   moment and then passes away. Such would Pharaoh (Ramases II. and
   Meneptah) have been but for Moses and Israel.

   There were many kings of Egypt before Pharaoh; and many kings of
   Babylon all through the centuries; but they are mentioned only as they
   come into touch with Israel. The Bible ignores them all except on this
   ground. That is why it could be said to Nebuchadnezzar, "THOU are this
   head of gold" (Dan. ii. 38). This was said of him only in connection
   with the Counsels of God, and the People of God; for Nebuchadnezzar was
   not the head or first king of Babylon. It is of Nimrod that it is
   written, "the beginning of his kingdom was Babel" (Gen. x. 10). Nimrod
   was, historically and chronologically, the first king of Babylon, and
   there was a long list of Babylon's kings from that time before
   Nebuchadnezzar possessed its throne.

   Why, then, after all that lapse of time, is Nebuchadnezzar singled out
   and spoken of definitely as the "head"? It can be accounted for only on
   the great principle which we seek to enforce, viz., that all Gentile
   history is ignored in the Bible, both as to kings and kingdoms, except
   as they stand and come into the Divine Counsels concerning Israel, and
   became "heads" over God's Land, and City, and People.

   This being so, we have a limit set to our interpretation of the great
   Kingdoms or Heads in the prophecies given in Daniel and in the
   Apocalypse. These prophecies are concerned with them only within those
   limits.

   Nebuchadnezzar and his father came into power, and made Babylon the new
   capital of Assyria in B.C. 625. [358] On this account, and because he
   was the first of the Gentile powers into whose hands dominion and
   headship over God's Land and City and People were given, it could be
   said of him, "Thou art this head of gold" (Dan. ii. 38). There is not a
   word here as to when he became the "head"; but the fact is declared as
   to this person that he, as the head of Babylon, was also the head of
   the Image, and, therefore, the head of Gentile supremacy.

   The earlier history of Babylon is not taken into account. A new
   departure is made in reckoning when, in the Counsels of God,
   Nebuchadnezzar becomes the king of Babylon.

   God sends him notification of the fact in that wonderful dream, where
   the great outline of this Gentile dominion over Israel's People, City,
   and Land is made known.

   The Image in Dan. ii. is clearly marked as consisting of five parts:--

   1. verse 32. "This image's head was fine gold, (one)
   2. verse 32. his breast and his arms of silver, (two)
   3. verse 32. his belly and his thighs of brass, (three)
   4. verse 33. his legs of iron (four)
   5. verse 33. his feet part of iron and part of clay." (five).

   This seems to be clear enough; only we have always been so accustomed
   to hear the fifth spoken of as part of the fourth, or the fourth
   revived, that we read the Scripture in the light of our tradition.

   It is not any answer to say that Dan. ii. mentions only four Gentile
   Powers. Dan. ii. says nothing of the kind. It mentions "the fourth."
   That is not "four." The Original is not (...) arbag (four [359] ); but
   it is (...) rebegahe (fourth [360] ). It is most important to note the
   difference between the ordinal number and the cardinal number. It
   nowhere says there were only four. On the contrary, the five are twice
   distinctly enumerated as being perfectly separate and independent. In
   verses 35 and 45 we have two separate enumerations of these five:

        Verse 35

                      Verse 45

   1.  the iron,

                      1.  the iron,

   2.  the clay,

                      2.  the brass,

   3.  the brass,

                      3.  the clay,

   4.  the silver, and

                      4.  the silver, and

   5.  the gold.

                      5.  the gold.

   Here, the five are not only mentioned separately, as to their material;
   but diversely, as to their order; so as to distinguish "the clay" as
   being one of five, and not as part of the iron (the "fourth") as is
   usually done.

   The same five kingdoms are equally clear in the interpretation:

   1. verse 38. "Thou art this head of gold" (one).
   2. verse 39. "And after thee shall arise another kingdom..." (two).
   3. verse 39. "And another, third kingdom..." (three).
   4. verse 40. "And the fourth kingdom..." (four).
   5. verse 41. "And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes..." (five).

   We need not dwell long on the details of the fulfilment of this Image.
   They are well known, and belong rather to the book of Daniel than to
   the Apocalypse. We content ourselves with their enumeration:

   1. The first of these Gentile Dominions was given by the God of Heaven
   to Nebuchadnezzar. It was formally taken from Israel and "given" to the
   Gentiles. Headship over Jerusalem (as well as over the Gentile powers)
   was that which specially marked that Gentile Power from all the other
   Gentile Powers that were, or might be, in the world at that time.

   The Powers that followed Babylon successively held Jerusalem in
   possession; and each succeeded the other, by conquest, in obtaining and
   holding that possession.

   2. The second was Medo-Persia.

   3. The third was Greece.

   4. The fourth was Rome.

   5. The fifth was, either the present power, which succeeded Rome in
   636-7, and is still treading down Jerusalem, thus fulfilling the Lord's
   prophecy in Luke xxi. 24; or, it is a yet future power, which is to be
   manifested in the Sunteleia after the Church shall have been removed:
   in which case the Lord's prophecy in Luke xxi. 24 would refer to some
   future treading down e.g., that mentioned in Rev. xi. 1, 2.

   The common interpretation reckons the "feet and toes" as part of the
   "legs," and divides the fourth power into two manifestations: one past,
   and the other future. But, even in this case, the future manifestation
   of the fourth could still be called the fifth as to numerical order.

   Surely, the mixture of "clay and iron" can no more be left out of our
   calculations than any of the other four metals.

   But what this fifth power is remains to be seen. It is partly strong
   and partly fragile [361] ; i.e., there is in it "the strength of the
   iron," and the weakness of "potters' clay." There can be no real union
   between the two characteristics of this fifth kingdom. It can be merely
   a mechanical mingling like that of iron and potters' clay; for, it
   truly says, "iron is not mixed with clay" (verse 43).

   On the one hand we have a fifth power which did actually succeed the
   fourth power, as the fourth succeeded the third, as the third succeeded
   the second, and the second succeeded the first.

   Neither of these, so far as we know, ever exercised the universal
   dominion which was given at the first; but what marked the true
   succession was Headship over God's Land and God's City, while Israel
   was excluded from the place and power which had been transferred, and
   committed to the Gentiles.

   When the Lord (in Luke xxi. 24) uttered that prophecy of the treading
   down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles (not "the nations"), the fourth
   Gentile power was exercising headship over the Land. To what treading
   down did He refer? Did He refer to the power which did actually succeed
   the fourth in 636-7? or Was He referring to a treading down that is
   still future? and Did He ignore and pass over the present treading
   down, which has lasted as long as all the other four put together?

   Whatever answer we may give to these questions, all must agree that
   after the Church shall have been removed; and the time shall have come
   for steps to be taken to reinstate Israel in its own Land, there must
   necessarily be some Gentile power in possession.

   The beginning of the Sunteleia must find some Gentile power exercising
   sovereignty over the City and the Land; and it cannot be denied that
   the present power now in possession may be the power found there when
   Israel comes into connection again with the Land.

   Rapid and sudden national changes, of course, may take place any day in
   the near East. But whatever may happen, the power then in possession
   will be the fifth, referred to in Dan. ii. and in the angel's words,
   uttered at the particular point of the Day of the Lord referred to in
   Rev. xvii. 10, which will be true of the Gentile powers as well as of
   the individual "heads," or kings, which may arise in the new Jewish
   State, after its resettlement; and immediately prior to the covenant
   which Antichrist will make with Israel at the beginning of the Telos,
   or seventieth week of Dan. ix.

   The Zionist Movement commenced with the first National Congress in
   1896, and has made great strides since then. Other changes in the
   Balkan States, and in the Constitution of Turkey, which took place so
   unexpectedly in 1908, show us how suddenly a change may take place
   which will lead up to the re-settlement of the Jews in their own land,
   perhaps, at first, under the suzerainty of the Sultan; and prepare the
   way for the rise of the Beast, first, in his mortal stage as the
   seventh head, and then in his superhuman stage as the eighth king.

   The dream was not given to Nebuchadnezzar until after his portion of it
   had been accomplished. The words, "Thou art this head of gold," were
   not uttered until some years after he had actually become the "head";
   and many years after he acted as the "head," when he first came against
   Jerusalem.

   It is clear, therefore, that the date of the dream and its
   interpretation is not the date from which our reckoning of the times of
   Gentile dominions is to commence; for they had already commenced, and
   that dominion was an accomplished fact at the time the dream was given.

   It is also clear that the date of the taking of Jerusalem and burning
   of the Temple is not the commencement of "the times of the Gentiles,"
   or of Gentile dominion; inasmuch as Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem
   in the nineteenth year of his reign, and exercised a Suzerain power for
   many years before. For he first came against Jerusalem in the eighth
   year of Jehoiakim, and Jehoiakim served him three years (2 Kings xxiv.
   1). Then his son Jehoiachin reigned three months -- reckon it one year
   (2 Kings xxiv. 8), when Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem, and sent
   him a prisoner to Babylon in the eighth year of the reign of
   Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings xxiv. 12).

   Then Nebuchadnezzar set up Zedekiah as king in the place of Jehoiachin
   (his uncle), and for eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem (2 Kings xxv.
   2); but having rebelled and sought to regain his independence (2 Kings
   xxiv. 20), Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem, and finally took it
   in his nineteenth year (being the eleventh of Zedekiah, 2 Kings xxv.
   8). Not until the twenty-third year of his reign did Nebuchadnezzar
   complete the carrying away of the people (Jer. lii. 30). Now, if the
   Holy Spirit reckons the actions of Nebuchadnezzar, not by date of the
   year, but the year of his reign, we have a clear indication that we are
   to reckon the years in the same way, and say that "the times of the
   Gentiles" began with the first year of the reign of him of whom it was
   afterwards said, "Thou art this head of gold."

   If so, then we have a period of at least twenty-three years cut off
   from, and marking the commencement of, these times of Gentile headship
   over the Land, the City, and the People.

   Why may not the closing period of these Gentile times (called the
   Sunteleia) be marked by a corresponding or similar number of years (23
   or more)?

   We believe there is a double fulfilment; first in Kingdoms, then in
   Kings. There have been, up to the present, four kingdoms, as enumerated
   above (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome), then the fifth, present or
   yet future. The Kingdom of the Beast will be the sixth, and the seventh
   will be "the Kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ." The Kingdoms
   being reckoned distinct from the Kings.

   So likewise, will there be at the time of the end (in the Sunteleia),
   five individuals who will briefly and successively contend for
   independence, and then the sixth (the "one is" referred to at the point
   of time of the Vision); he will be followed by the Beast, who will be
   "the seventh head" in his mortal stage for 3 1/2 years, and then "the
   eighth" king in his superhuman stage for the other 3 1/2 years (the
   last half of the seven years referred to in Dan. ix. 27).

   There were three kings in Jerusalem who struggled for independence, and
   whom Nebuchadnezzar put down and punished. Why may not there be five
   individuals in the Sunteleia who will lead the Jews to struggle
   likewise for independence against the Mohammedan Suzerain power?

   We read of "five kings" and the "sixth" in Rev. xvii. 10. Under these
   the Jews may rebel against the Suzerain power and finally "make a
   covenant" with the seventh, the Beast (Dan. ix. 27), in order to regain
   their complete independence.

   This would of course be in the mortal stage of these five kings, and of
   the sixth as well as the seventh. The duration of the mortal stage of
   the Beast, as the seventh head, will be, we know, only 3 1/2 years.
   [362] The rise and fall of the other kings may also be of very short
   duration. A few years would suffice for the fulfilment of Rev. xvii.
   10.

   Dan. xi. shows how the Jews will be affected by him who in his mortal
   career is the first king of Syria: and then, on the rooting up of three
   of the kings, becomes the seventh head of Gentile power.

   At the point contemplated in the Vision (Rev. xvii. 10) this fifth head
   will have fallen: The fifth head of Gentile dominion over Jerusalem; as
   well as the fifth of these last individual kings in their mortal stage.
   Thus a co-terminous point may mark an important epoch, for it is of the
   "sixth" king that it is said, at this juncture "one is." Of the
   "seventh," at that moment, it is said he "is not" but is then about to
   arise and "be present."

   During the years of the Sunteleia, or consummation, there will be ample
   time for the Euphrates valley to be developed and Babylon to be
   rebuilt. That it will be rebuilt is necessitated by the fact that it
   has never yet been destroyed in the manner prophesied. The further
   evidence of this must be reserved till we come to chap. xviii.

   One thing we know, and that is, that God will accomplish all that He
   has foretold; and, if we refer to present movements, it will be only to
   show how easily and simply all may come about; and so naturally too, as
   to be almost unnoticed except to those who "know the times."

   With regard to the Beast, proper, we are further told in this verse, 8,
   that the Beast spoken of "shall ascend out of the Abyss and go into
   perdition." We see this ascending in chap. xiii. 1. This is the Beast
   in his superhuman stage. For John saw the mark of the wound on him. And
   John wondered. All shall wonder at this manifestation, and the object
   of that wonder is this Beast who "was, and is not, and shall be
   present." The world-powers are, when represented as "the Beast," always
   viewed as one. The Beast is never seen apart from his seven heads and
   ten horns; if so, they must be contemporary.

   In chap. xvii. the Beast is seen as one individual, as well as
   collectively. The Dragon in heaven comprises seven heads and ten horns;
   but, when the one individual who directs all the movements of the
   Dragon Power is spoken of, Satan is referred to (chap. xi. 7; xiii. 5.
   Comp. Dan. vii. 11; xi. 36). The same is true when the one who is the
   executive head of the seven, and all the parts comprising the Beast is
   referred to.

   At the close of his mortal stage, i.e., the first 3 1/2 years, he
   receives his death wound; and therefore at this stage, before he comes
   up out of the Abyss in his superhuman form, it can be truly said that
   he "was" and "shall be present." It could also, at the moment of time
   referred to by the Angel, be as truly said "and is not." [363]

   The "is not" does not mean that he never had an existence, for the very
   expression implies it; as it could not be used of one who never had any
   existence at all. Just as with Christ Himself, relatively, as regards
   the earth, it can at this present moment be truly said He was and is
   not, and yet shall be present here again. [364] But of course as
   regards Himself absolutely, "He was, and is, and is to come."

   The following verse connects this Beast directly with the Beast of
   chap. xiii., for it is added

   9-. Here is the mind which hath wisdom.]      This repetition of xiii.
   18 identifies and connects these two chapters. "Here is wisdom. Let him
   that hath understanding count the number of the Beast, for it is man's
   number" (See above, on xiii. 18). The word rendered "mind" in xvii. 9,
   and "understanding" in xiii. 18, is the same, viz. vous (nous). And
   this "wisdom" is, to understand that, though a "Beast" is seen in the
   vision, it is not a wild Beast that is meant, but one great final
   superhuman personality; viz., "a man" energized by Satanic power.

   -9. The seven heads are (or represent) seven mountains on which the
   woman sitteth, (-10-) and they are (or represent) seven kings:]      We
   translate the last clause thus, with Alford, RV., and others. The
   punctuation of the AV. in this verse is very faulty. Verse 9 should end
   with the word "wisdom," and the remainder of the verse should form part
   of the tenth verse.

   The explanation of the angel would not then have been cut in two, and
   interpreted separately as is commonly the case; and the "seven
   mountains" would not have been treated independently of the clause
   which goes on to further explain what they signify. The "seven
   mountains" are, according to this, "seven kings." It does not say that
   "there are seven kings" over and above, and beside the "seven
   mountains;" but that the "seven mountains are (i.e., represent) seven
   kings." The seven heads belong to the Beast on which the woman sitteth.
   According to the structure of "E., 1.", verses 9, 10 have for their
   subject the confederates of the Beast. Now "mountains" cannot be
   confederates, but kings can. Hence, though the word "mountains" is
   used, it is at once explained that "kings" are meant, so as to keep us
   from making a mistake. Compare Zech. iv. 7.

   These mountains, then, are no mere heaps of earth or rocks, but
   "kings." The word "mountain" is often used as a Figure (Symbol, or
   Metaphor, or Metonymy) for a kingdom. It is used of Babylon itself in
   Jer. li. 25, and of Messiah's kingdom in Dan. ii. 35.

   For interpreters to take these literally as "mountains," in the midst
   of a context which the same interpreters take to be symbolic; and in
   the face of the interpretation actually given by the angel that "they
   are seven kings," is to play fast and loose with the word of prophecy.
   It says here that "they are seven kings," and we believe what is said.

   The seven heads do not belong to any one of the world-Powers; for each
   kingdom had many such "heads" or kings.

   They necessarily belong to all of them, and are viewed as one Beast, so
   that they may be seen as belonging to, and forming part of, the whole.
   That is why this Beast in chap. xiii. 2 is like unto a "leopard" (the
   third, Greece), and his feet as the feet of a "bear" (the second,
   Persia), and his mouth as a "lion" (the first, Babylon). He combines in
   himself the symbolic marks of the others.

   The woman (i.e., that great city, verse 18) sitteth on many waters
   (i.e., reigneth over peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues,
   verse 15), and is seen seated on a scarlet coloured beast (i.e.,
   carried and supported by all the kings and all the members which make
   up the body of the Beast. This will be the condition of things at the
   point of view referred to in the Vision. In this 9th verse we have a
   description of what will be at an early part of the first 3 1/2 years.
   It is the present tense, "IS SITTING," and is prophetic of what is now
   still future. It does not say has sat or did sit, but is now sitting,
   i.e., not at the moment when the Angel was interpreting it to John, but
   the moment when it will be actually taking place in "the day of the
   Lord." It is the woman (i.e., that great city, verse 18), upon which
   our attention is concentrated in this verse, and the support afforded
   to her at that time. All are contemporary with each other; joined
   together as the metals are joined to make up the figure of a man.

   If in verses 9, 10, literal mountains be meant, then commentators are
   divided between Constantinople, Brussels, Jerusalem, and Rome.

   The late Albert Barnes says, "All respectable interpreters agree that
   it refers to Rome; either Pagan, Christian, or Papal."

   If this be so, then we must be content to be reckoned, with many
   others, among those who are not "respectable." Rome Papal cannot be
   meant, as it never had seven regal powers. Rome Christian cannot be
   meant, as it never had any regal powers at all. Rome Pagan cannot be
   meant, as no seven kings can be agreed upon by commentators; and it is
   to be destroyed by the stone of Dan. ii. 35, 45. See also Dan. vii. 26,
   27.

   Of these seven heads, or kings, it is added, that

   -10-. Five are fallen, the [365] one (the sixth) is (at this stage of
   the Vision), the other (the seventh), is not yet come.]      If this be
   interpreted of Gentile Dominion at the future point of the Vision
   referred to by the Angel; then, as to the dominions, the five will have
   fallen: (1) Babylon, (2) Medo-Persia, (3) Greece, (4) Rome, (5)
   Mohammedan. The sixth will be the Kingdom of the Beast, (7) the seventh
   will be the Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.

   And as to the individuals, five of the seven (and the sixth) will have
   obtained sovereignty or independence for the Jews, and the way will be
   clear for the seventh to come in his mortal stage.

   The seven are all of one series. How can the sixth be Rome, and thus be
   the Beast, and contain the whole, including the eighth!

   If we interpret these kingdoms and kings in any other way, and on any
   other principle than that given above, we are at once landed in a mass
   of conflicting opinions and speculations that are perfectly appalling.

   Alford gives us (1) Egypt, (2) Nineveh, (3) Babylon, (4) Persia, (5)
   Greece (with, of course, Rome for the sixth), and the seventh the
   Christian Empire under Constantine!

   Others give us (1) Assyria, (2) Egypt, (3) Babylon, (4) Persia, (5)
   Greece, (6) Rome, (7) Future.

   Others (Moses Stuart among them) give (1) Julius Caesar, (2) Augustus,
   (3) Tiberius, (4) Caligula, (5) Claudius, (6) Nero, (7) Galba. He also
   suggests beginning with Augustus, so as to make Nero the sixth; but in
   this case he defies all history, which makes Domitian the Emperor in
   John's day.

   Others make (1) Romulus, (2) Numa Pompilius, (3) Tullus Hostilius, (4)
   Ancus Martius, (5) Tarquinius Priscus, (6) Servius Tullius, (7)
   Tarquinius Superbus.

   Others, confining the list to those who died violent deaths, make it
   (1) Julius Caesar, (2) Tiberius, (3) Caligula, (4) Claudius, (5) Nero,
   (6) Galba, (7) Otho.

   Another suggests (1) Pharaoh, (2) Sennacherib, (3) Belshazzar, (4)
   Antiochus Epiphanes, (5) Herod Agrippa, (6) Nero Caesar, (7) Napoleon.

   These are all by "respectable" interpreters. But is not the confusion
   such as to make us regard this book with anything but respect? Which of
   these and many others are we to take as the meaning of the angel's
   words "five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come"?

   With regard to Gentile power, why, we may ask, go back behind the
   beginning God has Himself set and given when it was said to
   Nebuchadnezzar, "thou art this head of gold"? (Dan. ii. 38).

   Why go back to Egypt, Assyria, and Nineveh; or begin with Rome, when
   God makes the beginning at Babylon?

   And with regard to individuals, Why make all the seven kings belong to
   one of the four world-powers, when the Beast represents the whole? If
   we confine ourselves to one -- the fourth -- it had many more than
   seven heads. And if we include all the "heads" or "kings" which the
   whole contained, then we have so many that it is quite impossible to do
   anything with them in connection with the interpretation of these
   prophecies.

   The greater error has always been in making anything, rather than
   Israel, the pivot of the prophecies: and reckoning the points of the
   compass from any centre except Jerusalem, or the place where the Vision
   was seen, or the prophecy written.

   There are other difficulties connected with the common interpretations
   of the fourth World Power, which makes Rome the whole Beast, and yet
   one of its heads at the same time. "Respectable interpreters" who make
   the whole Beast, Rome; make also one of its heads or kings to be Rome;
   and this one head afterwards comprises the ten kingdoms into which it
   is subdivided! Whereas the ten kings of Daniel are not identical with
   the ten of the Apocalypse, for the ten of Rev. xvii. never were kings
   in their mortal stage, for it expressly says in verse 12 that they
   "have received no kingdom as yet."

   How anyone can hold that this one "head" afterwards comprises the ten
   kingdoms, it is difficult to understand. Territory may be divided into
   ten kingdoms, but the "head" cannot be.

   The image of Daniel ii. was seen complete as it will be in "the end
   time," while as yet only the first of these powers was then existing,
   and all the others were future. So, in like manner, the image is to be
   viewed also as complete when the whole shall be combined in the Beast
   (and the seventh and eighth heads), though all the others will then be
   past. The stone falls on the feet of the image and destroys the whole
   image at one blow. The Beast as see in Rev. xiii. and xvii. combines
   the whole, and is destroyed at one stroke at the Apocalypse of the King
   of kings in Rev. xix.

   It is important to observe that the Beast is never seen in the
   Apocalypse without the seven heads and ten horns, because they are then
   seen as being contemporary and in their superhuman form. But they were
   successive in their mortal form.

   The Beast in Daniel has not got seven heads. He could not have unless
   they were contemporary, which is against the prophecy in Daniel. He has
   ten horns during the time when the seventh head becomes supreme.

   The only solution of all these difficulties seems to be in the "eighth"
   king, who is regarded as "of the seven," and yet fulfils all that is
   said of "the fourth Beast" and of "the little horn" of Dan. vii. and
   viii.

   We have to note (1) that Dan. ii. and vii. show the full length of
   duration from Nebuchadnezzar to the coming of the Son of man in Rev.
   xix.

   (2) that within that duration the whole of unfulfilled prophecy
   concerning Gentile Dominion must find its place.

   (3) that Dan. viii. gives the "end time" of that duration linked on to
   the earlier period in order to show its connection with the whole. And

   (4) that Dan. xi. gives the "last days" of that "end time," but linked
   on to the earlier verses (xi. 1-4).

   Thus we have the whole period of "the times of the Gentiles;" then,
   "the end time" of Gentile rule; and, finally, "the last days" of that
   rule.

   What is said in Dan. vii. and viii is for the most part still future.
   It is seen in immediate connection with the setting of the throne of
   the Ancient of Days (Dan. vii. 9-27). "At the time of the end shall be
   the Vision" (Dan. viii. 17). It relates to "what shall be in the last
   end of the indignation, for at the time appointed the end shall be"
   (Dan. viii. 19). The prophecy relates to "the latter end of their
   kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full" (Dan. viii. 23;
   marg., are accomplished).

   In Dan. vii. 17, 18, we are expressly told that "these great Beasts,
   which are four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth, but
   the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom." Their rising,
   therefore, is at the time of the end, and they are "kings."

   When it was said to Nebuchadnezzar, "Thou art this head of gold" (Dan.
   ii. 38), did he realise all that it meant? Did the sons of Abraham
   realise all the promises to Israel as to the complete possession of the
   whole Land? Just so with the Beasts of Daniel. In their mortal stage
   they failed (especially the fourth) to realise all the prophecies of
   it. But as Israel will realise all its prophecies in its second
   manifestation, so will it be with the Beast in its superhuman stage.

   Rev. xvii. 10 fixes the point of the Vision, there referred to, as
   being just between the mortal and the superhuman stages.

   "Five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come:

   -10. and when he shall have come, he must remain a short time.]
   i.e., a short time compared with the others. We have a similar
   statement in xii. 12; where, when Satan is cast down, he had "great
   wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."

   Seven years will be "a short time." Three-and-a-half will be still
   shorter.

   Six "heads" will then have already appeared, both as dominions, and as
   individuals in their mortal stage. They will have gone down into the
   Abyss. At that point in the Vision the rise of the "seventh" head will
   be imminent as to his mortal stage. Then after three-and-a-half years
   will come his death; and then (after three to four days' public
   exposure), his re-incarnation.

   The seventh head can be no person or king that has ever yet existed on
   the earth. We have no kingdom here, but a mighty and terrible king. He
   "falls" like the preceding six. He will be slain with the sword (chap.
   xiii. 3, 14), but he comes to life again; and then the last great
   superhuman ruler of "the kingdoms of this world" will stand revealed
   until he is destroyed by "the King of Kings." Everything will then have
   been prepared, and events will move with unparalleled rapidity.

   The "Kingdoms" and the "Kings," in Dan. and Apoc.:

   "HEADS" or "KINGS"

   7.  "The Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ."


   The above refers to Headship over God's City, People, and Land. It does
   not, therefore, include the "Ten Kings" or "Kingdoms," either of Daniel
   or Revelation, which are outside the Land.

   The eleventh verse brings us to the second pair of members which
   interpret the Beast and his Confederates. Chap. xvii.

   verses 8-10 give the first pair;
   verses 11, 12 give the second pair;
   verses 13-17 give the third pair;

   See the Structure above.


   F^2. xvii. 11, 12. The second pair of members.

   11. And the beast that was, and is not, even he himself is an eighth,
   and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.]     We must carefully
   note that which he is commonly spoken of as "the eighth head," he is
   not so called in Scripture. There, he is known only as "an eighth"
   king. We have in this verse (according to the Structure) the further
   history of the Beast.

   In verses 8 and 11 we have the two stages of the Beast's career clearly
   distinguished. In chap. xiii. 3 John saw what had already happened
   before xiii. 1, in the mortal stage of the Beast, before he came up out
   of the Abyss. John saw what had caused the Beast to go down into the
   Abyss. And when John saw him "coming up," he observed (xiii. 3) one
   from among his heads as having been slain.

   In his mortal form he runs his career during the first part of the week
   (Dan. ix. 27; the "forty and two months" of Rev. xiii. 5). During this
   period God's two witnesses (xi. 3) are the Divine testimony on earth.

   When they shall have finished their testimony, or immediately before
   the fulfilment of their mission, the Beast (in his mortal form) is
   killed. He receives his deadly sword-wound (xiii. 3), and comes to life
   again; he comes up out of the Abyss (xi. 7), makes war on the Two
   Witnesses, and runs the rest of his career in his superhuman form
   (xiii.--).

   He is the first called "the Beast" in this book, in Rev. xi. 7.

   He is "of the seven." That is to say, he is the 7th in another (his
   8th, or superhuman) form. And though he is "an eighth" king, there are
   not really eight, but only seven, for the seventh and eighth are the
   same personage; therefore, it is said that the eighth is "of the
   seven."

   As the mortal seventh Head, he is the "little horn" of Dan. vii.; the
   King of Dan. xi. 21.

   Roughly speaking, the mortal stage would fill the first half of the
   last of "the seventy weeks" (i.e., the first 3 1/2 years of Dan. ix.
   27); and the superhuman stage would occupy the last half. But there is
   nothing to show us what length of time will run between his rise and
   his assassination. Neither can we say exactly how long the time will be
   between his death-stroke and his reappearance. We suppose the later
   would not exceed four days.

   Then, immediately upon his resurrection, he kills (crucifies?) the Two
   Witnesses (ch. xi.). Consequently, their 1,260 days must just overlap
   into his 42 months. They must have witnessed, therefore, for nearly
   1,260 days during his mortal stage, before his assassination.

   It would appear that he is on the scene, entering into various
   political affairs, before he is actually manifested as the 7th head,
   i.e., the Anti-Christ. The "League" of Dan. xi. 23 appears to be made
   before the "Covenant" of Dan. ix. 27. The "League" is one of the first
   steps he takes to mix himself up in the Jews' affairs.

   The "Covenant" of Dan. ix. 27 seems to be a subsequent advance upon
   that. The Covenant would mark the beginning of the seven years.

   During the first half of the week (in which the seventh head runs and
   completes his mortal career), God's Two Witnesses (ch. xi. 3) are the
   proclaimers of the special Divine Testimony on the Earth. Just before
   the completion of their Testimony the Beast is killed. His mortal stage
   is thus ended. When he comes to life again, he comes up from the Abyss
   and makes war upon them, and upon all who will not worship him.

   As to the heads: In their mortal stage they are only seven, and are
   successive. But in their superhuman stage they are still seven (xiii. 1
   and xvii. 7), and they are collective in the one -- the wild Beast.

   This verse thus contains further particulars about the Beast already
   mentioned in verse 8. And now, in verse 12 we have the confederates
   again.

   12. And the ten horns which thou sawest are (i.e., represent) ten
   kings, who have not yet received a kingdom; but they receive authority
   as kings at one and the same hour with the Beast]      (i.e., at the
   same time or season. See chap. xiv. 7, 15; xviii. 10, 17, 19. Matt.
   xiv. 15; xviii. 1. Mark vi. 35. Luke i. 10; xiv. 17. 1 John ii. 18.
   John v. 35. 2 Cor. vii. 8. Philem. 15). These ten kings, in their
   mortal stage, were not actually kings; but now, in their superhuman
   form, they are contemporary, and receive power at one and the same time
   with the Beast. Popular phraseology always speaks of them as "ten
   kingdoms." No wonder they cannot be identified or prognosticated, for
   the Scripture says nothing about "ten kingdoms," but always "ten
   kings." The substitution of "kingdoms" only introduces confusion. The
   verse would then read "They are ten kingdoms, which have received no
   kingdom as yet, but receive authority as kingdoms." This is absurd as
   well as confusing.

   They are seen as kings only in connection and company with the last or
   eighth king. We know not who or what these ten kings may be. They are
   not the "kings of the earth" mentioned in verse 18; for these are
   subordinate to the ten of which this verse speaks.

   On the first emergence of the corporate wild-beast out of the Abyss,
   the woman (i.e., the great city), Babylon) is supported by it (or as it
   is expressed, "she sits upon it"). But she is not true to this new and
   superhuman power. She intrigues with "the kings of the earth" (mortals)
   while the Beast out of the Abyss is supporting her. As Henry VIII.
   dealt partially with the Roman Church in England, so will the Beast
   deal with Babylon universally. He will confiscate her revenues,
   appropriate her real estate as well as personality. The city, thus
   "stripped" will be wholly in the hands of this superhuman power (chap.
   xviii.), and filled with evil spirits, until a mighty angel from heaven
   completes the destruction.


   F^3. xvii. 13, 14. The third pair of members.

   13. These have one mind (i.e., the same view, intent, and consent), and
   give up their power and authority unto the beast.]      Not only are
   they contemporaneous as to time, but they are of one accord as to
   purpose. This will be something very different from a so-called
   "concert" of Europe. Never were any ten kings found of one accord. It
   is powerful spirit-influence that brings about this unanimity (ch. xvi.
   14).

   14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome
   them: because he is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they that are
   with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.]      Here is the war
   for which the demons go forth to gather the kings of the earth
   together. Two reasons are assigned for the result of this war. The
   glory of the King, and His own chosen forces. The battle is prophesied
   in xvii. 14, but not fought till chap. xix.

   15. And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot
   (i.e., "the great city") sitteth, are (i.e., represent) peoples, and
   multitudes, and nations, and tongues.]      This commences the second
   division of the Angel's interpretation of the Vision. It is indicated
   by the words, "And he saith to me," repeated from the commencement of
   the first division in verse 7. The woman represents "that great city."
   Babylon is thus addressed (Jer. li. 13): "O thou that dwellest upon
   many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come." How this can be
   interpreted of Rome we know not; for it is not the vision we have here,
   but the interpretation of it.

   We ask our readers to compare the following passages as here arranged
   in parallel columns. The first column contains the passages from the
   Old Testament, and the other from the Apocalypse. Both are distinctly
   said to concern Babylon. We recognise no authority, however
   "respectable," which assures us that these passages all refer to Rome:

   16. And the ten horns which thou sawest, and [366] the beast, these
   shall hate the harlot (i.e., that great city), and shall make her
   desolate and naked (i.e., shall loot the city and strip it), and shall
   eat her flesh (i.e., take possession of her treasures), and shall burn
   (i.e., the city) with fire.]      How a false system of religion, Papal
   or any other, can be thus treated we cannot understand. The reading
   "and," instead of "upon," is very important. It associates the hatred
   of the eighth king with that of the ten, instead of making him distinct
   in this hatred, and separate from this war. The word "these" links them
   all together. The words "these" is masculine, while "the horns" and
   "the beast" are neuter. It is the figure called Syllepsis, by which the
   concord of the pronoun is logical rather than grammatical.

   The Beast himself will be at the time in occupation of the City, while
   the Ten Kings are exercising their authority each in his own part of
   the world; and that, just as the Papacy exercises its authority in many
   lands -- so the woman's agents do the same, with this difference: that
   in all the kingdoms of the world the (mortal) "kings of the earth" are
   committing fornication with this woman i.e., are one in religious
   intrigue and confederacy. Babylon sits upon many waters: i.e.,
   "peoples, multitudes, nations, tongues:" among all these Babylon is
   religiously a-whoreing.

   Above "the Kings of the Earth," (mortals), reign "the Ten Kings." The
   whole earth is divided to them. For a little while (till they shall
   have secured a firm position) they will support the woman. As soon as
   they feel themselves to be secure, then, in all these "peoples,
   multitudes, nations, and tongues" they begin to make war with her
   simultaneously: the Beast (the last king of Babel in Babylon) and the
   Ten Kings in their respective parts of the world. So that, in every
   nation, people, tongue, and multitude, the merchants of the earth can
   stand afar off and bewail the destruction of the woman. For there will
   be an auto-de-fe among all the peoples by whom the woman has been
   supported.

   For this destruction compare the passages from Jeremiah given above;
   and compare them with its execution in Rev. xviii. 8. The reason of
   this is given in the next verse.

   17. For God put it (lit., gave it) into their hearts to carry out
   (lit., to do) His mind, and to carry out their own mind, and to give
   their kingdom to the beast until the words of God shall be
   accomplished.]      Apparently it is Satan's work, but God is over all,
   and He "shall send them strong delusion" (2 Thess. ii. 11. Compare Is.
   x. 7). They carry out their own wilful desires, but blindly fulfil the
   counsel of God.

   They give their kingdom, not kingdoms. They transfer no territory, for
   all the kingdoms are one under the Beast which shall "devour the whole
   earth."

   Just as the Beast is one, though composed of many individual superhuman
   beings; so will the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ be one, though
   there will be in it many kings and principalities and powers.

   These "ten kings" give their royal power. But there is a limit to it
   all, and that limit is expressed in the words "the true sayings of
   God," to these all must come: beyond these none can go.

   We now come to the end; to the interpretation concerning the woman: the
   final statement which sets the whole matter at rest.


   D. xvii. 18. The Woman.

   18. And the woman whom thou sawest is that great city, which exerciseth
   sovereignty over the kings of the earth]      viz., those who have been
   so called in xvi. 14.

   Babylon is the city named in verse 5, but its destruction, as
   prophesied in chap. xviii., is very different from that of which
   Jeremiah speaks. Other cities have been suggested, and even England has
   been added to the interpretations, because of its union of Church and
   State. Though how it can be a city we know not.

   The revival of Babylon is prophesied in Zech. v. 1-11, 500 years before
   the Christian Era. The lawless woman there, answers to the great harlot
   here, and the angel says it was intended "to build it an house in the
   land of Shinar; and it shall be established and set there upon her own
   base." "The land of Shinar" carries us back, not to Italy, England, or
   Palestine, but to Babylon and to Gen. xi. 2-9 and Dan. i. 1, 2. That
   prophecy has never yet been fulfilled. Babylon is to be the last of the
   powers of the earth to drink the cup of Divine wrath in the day of the
   Lord (Jer. xxv. 17-26). "All the kings of the earth: and the king of
   Sheshac (i.e., Babylon) shall drink after them."

   The common interpretation of Zech. v. will hardly bear examination: and
   it is certainly an error to suppose that Rev. xviii. is commercial.
   Babylon in Rev. xviii. is a buyer and not a seller. It is not an
   exchange of merchandise. And with respect to Zech., commentators seize
   upon the measure and weight.

   The Ephah is a measure of capacity, dry measure say for grain. As grain
   is put into a measure, so the sinner will be collect in a heap. Are not
   these the thieves and perjurers of the previous vision? When the leaden
   lid is lifted up there is seen a woman sitting in the measure. The
   woman, it says, is "wickedness," not "commerce." She is not permitted
   to get out of the measure. The lead is put back again. It seems to have
   been lifted just to let the prophet see what was inside. The Ephah,
   with its contents, is not suffered to remain in the Land: it is carried
   into the land of Shinar. This looks more like the expulsion from
   Palestine of "wickedness" or reprobates, thieves and perjurers,
   possibly at the time when the Two Witnesses are on the earth.

   It suggests, not commerce, but rather the worst kind of financing
   maintained by thieving and perjury (Zech.v. 1). So intense is the
   "wickedness" that a "flying roll," of the same dimensions as the porch
   of the Temple, goes forth as a curse, showing that the wicked will be
   judged by Temple measurements.

   This is hardly the place to go into the prophecies of Zechariah. But
   all are too ready to follow a plausible tradition, without independent
   study of God's Word.

   We are all agreed that Zech. v. is future; and that it concerns
   Babylon. But the question is, Does "lead" (no matter of what weight)
   ever represent money? And does not a "woman" represent a religious
   system, rather than commerce?

   Jerusalem, we know, is to become a great city, the joy of the whole
   earth. But, before that comes to pass, Babylon also will become a great
   city; the astonishment, but the curse, of the whole earth.

   We have more than once referred to and spoken of the revival and
   rebuilding of Babylon. Many laugh at the very idea. But if they will
   not listen to the clear teachings of the word of God, will they listen
   to what man says? If they deem this revival as unlikely or impossible,
   judging by the standard of their own imagination, what will they say to
   the following, from The Daily Express (London), Jan. 28, 1902? It is
   not speculation, but news, which is given us under the heading of
   "Germany's Great Railroad": and the sub-title "Some facts about the
   grand Mesopotamian railway scheme," by William Durban. He says,

   "An immense revolution is likely to be brought about in the Near East
   within the next decade. The shriek of the locomotive will in a few
   years be heard echoing over the salt marshes, bituminous plains, and
   magnificent higher and more fertile tracts, which make the vast
   Mesopotamian plain between the Euphrates and the Tigris the most
   curious mosaic of landscape in the world.

   "It is startling to think of this coming raid of the engineers into the
   cradle of the world's most ancient civilisation. Abraham's native
   country is to be invaded by horded of navvies, and all along the
   western bank of the mighty historic Tigris will gleam the twin steel
   riband which will bring the whole length of the effete Empire within
   the grip of European influence.


   "A Resurrection of Babylon."

   "The Kaiser has undoubtedly scored. When in December, 1899, it was
   announced that the German Anatolian Railway Company had received a
   concession from Adbul Hamid for the construction of a railway from
   Konieh to Bagdad, it was generally felt that the scheme would hang in
   the air for at least a generation. But the German Emperor is a model
   man of business, who has posed of late as the Sultan's 'only friend.'
   He did not for nothing organize, by means of a splendid squad of
   military officers, that Turkish army which crumpled up the Greek
   legions at Domoko and everywhere on the Thessalian plains. The new
   Irade settles the affair.

   "It is a favourite thesis with the people who ponder over prophetic
   mysteries that both Babylon and Nineveh are to be resuscitated in more
   than the ancient glories of Nebuchadnezzar and Sennacherib. Who can
   tell? It is certain that the Kaiser entertains the dream of founding a
   magnificent empire in the Near East. He is going to work in the way
   which is like to follow up his sermon at Jerusalem by practical
   results...

   "Few people realise the magnitude of the Sultan's Asiatic dominions.
   They form the most important section of the earth's surface in
   connection with the international political situation of the near
   future. The Eastern Question only sleeps, and its slumbers are very
   uneasy."

   With this comes the news that this Railway is to be begun at once
   (1902), in five different places: and that Edison has invented a new
   cement which will enable houses to be built in three or four days!

   For ourselves, we need no evidence of this kind; but it clearly shows
   that what we regard as certain, from God's Word, is not altogether
   impossible from man's point of view.


   X. chap. xviii. The Judgment of the Great City.

   This is the third and last of the three great divisions of the Sixth
   Vision "on earth" (chap. xvi.--).

   The first we lettered V. chap. xvi., The Great Judgments.

   The second, we lettered W. chap. xvii., The Great Harlot.

   The third we are now to consider is X. chap. xviii., The Great City.

   The last verse of chap. xvii. closed it by giving the interpretation of
   the woman as being "that great city." Though the woman is the first
   thing mentioned in that chapter, yet her interpretation is left till
   the end, so that the mention of the city may lead on to the account of
   its destruction, which is the subject of chap. xviii. In chap. xvii. we
   have the conflict about that great city in which the seven heads, and
   ten kings, and "the kings of the earth," and the Beast ("the eighth"
   king), all take part. But now, the city itself is to be judged as a
   city.

   Its fall had already been prophetically fore-announced in preliminary
   and general terms (xiv. 8). But the seventh Vial has since been poured
   out, and the city has already been shaken to its foundation (xvi.
   17-21). Its final judgment and utter extinction, however, yet remain to
   be accomplished. And the description of this is now to be given in
   chap. xviii.

   Many who see Rome in some form in chap. xvii., yet find Babylon,
   literal, in chap. xviii. But where is the authority for making such a
   vital separation between the subjects of the two chapters? There is no
   indication of such a marked distinction, either in the Text, or in the
   context.

   It is perfectly well known that Rome was never either "great" or
   commercial. It is no Port; and no "shipmaster" goes thither. Babylon
   itself was never "suddenly" destroyed, as this city will be. The
   suddenness of its destruction is the one dominant feature of this
   chapter. True, Babylon has come under judgment which is the subject of
   this and other prophecies concerning her (Is. xlvii. 11 Jer. li. 8).
   Nothing in history is known to have thus happened to Babylon. And
   besides, it is prophecy, and not history, which is given to us in this
   chapter: something that was to happen after this Revelation was given
   to John. But nothing like this has happened, before or since. So that
   if Rome be the city, Rome must yet become the great political and
   religious centre; with port and harbour. And it is quite as difficult
   to believe in this revival of Rome, as to believe in the revival of
   Babylon. In either case it is a question of revival. Babylon was not
   suddenly destroyed. She has gone down in gradual decay, but her history
   is known, and her ruins stand to-day. Arabs pitch their tents there. It
   is not the "abode of dragons," as it is yet to be after its sudden
   destruction (See Is. xiii. 9, 12. Jer. l. 3). There was a church there
   in Peter's day (1 Peter v. 13). There is to this day a governor of the
   land, who collects the taxes and customs for the Turkish government.

   It does not fulfil the conditions described in Jer. l. 1-4, 28, 40, 41,
   46; xxv. 12; li. 3, 6, 26, 27, 29, 43. Is. xiii. 20, where it is said
   that it is to be "perpetual desolations," "where not man dwelleth,"
   "empty without inhabitant." The above references need not be quoted in
   full. They have only to be read to convince the reader that they have
   never yet been fulfilled: This being so, we have the fulfilment of them
   described in this chap. xviii.

   The Structure of the chapter, as a whole, is exquisite; and its
   symmetry is perfect.

   It is composed of a Repeated Alternation of six members; three
   concerning Babylon and its people (F); and three concerning God and His
   people (G).

   The three concerning Babylon's judgment are (1) The Proclamation of it,
   (2) The Reasons for it, and (3) The Manner of it.

   The three concerning Babylon's people are (1) Their Sin, (2) Their
   Lamentation, (3) Their Silence.

   The Three concerning God's people are (1) Their call to come out of
   her, (2) Their call to Rejoice over her, (3) Their blood found in her.

   We shall have little to do or say regarding this chapter, beyond giving
   the Structure, and the Translation.

   The Structure of chap. xviii. is as follows:--

   X. chap. xviii.  The Judgment of the Great City.

   X |     F^1 |     m^1 | 1, 2.  Babylon's judgment.  Announcement of it.
                                n^1 | 3.  Babylon's associates.  Their
   sin.
                                        G^1 | 4.  God's people. Their call
   to "Come out of her."
            F^2 |     m^2 | 5-8.  Babylon's judgment.  Reasons for it.
                                n^2 | 9-19.  Babylon's inhabitants.  Their
   lamentation.
                                        G^2 | 20.  God's people.  Their
   call to "Rejoice over her."
           F^3 |     m^3 |  21.  Babylon's judgment.  Manner of it.
                                n^3 | 22, 23.  Babylon's inhabitants.
   Their silence.
                                        G^3 | 24.  God's people.  Their
   blood "found in her."


   This is the manner in which this solemn chapter is constructed for us,
   and presented to us.

   Every part brings out its perfection, and apprises us of the Divine
   source of Babylon's judgment; and of the Divine authority and truth of
   its prophetic declaration.


   m^1. xviii. 1-3. Babylon's judgment announced.

   1. [367] After these things I saw another [368] angel coming down from
   heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lighted up with his
   glory.]      This was another angel, and not the one who had been
   speaking to John in chap. xvii. The Vision is still "on Earth"; hence,
   John sees this angel coming down out of heaven. Interpreters seem as
   anxious to make this, and other of the angels, to be the Lord Jesus, as
   they are to make all else to be the church. There is no occasion to go
   beyond the simple understanding of the words. This was no ordinary
   angel; for he was invested with great power and glory.

   2. And he cried with a mighty voice, [369] saying,

   Fallen, fallen [370] is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation
   of demons (see Isa. xxiv. 14, especially in lxx), and a hold of every
   unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.


   n^1. xviii. 3 Babylon's Associates.

   3. because all the nations have drunk of the exciting wine [371] of her
   fornication and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her,
   and the merchants of the earth waxed rich through the power (or
   abundance) of her luxury."]

   This identifies this city with that of chap. xvii. We have the same
   wine and the same idolatries and the same "kings of the earth." But, in
   addition to these, we have the announcement which implies that Babylon
   will become the headquarters of Spiritism, the habitation of demons,
   and the hold and home of every unclean spirit. As a cage is full of
   birds, so will Babylon be full of evil spirits and demons, controlling
   the great apostasy at its fountain head.

   It seems impossible to miss the clear marks of identification which are
   given in verse 3.

   If we look at these two chapters carefully, we fail to find the
   distinction so persistently affirmed. Some one states a thing as a
   fact; and then others think they see it. There is no such thing as
   "Mystic Babylon." The Babylon mentioned in chap. xvii. is the same as
   that of chap. xviii. It is the "Woman" which is a secret symbol or
   sign. But that means only that we are not to take it literally as a
   woman, but as "the great city," as is explained in verse 18. Her name
   is clearly written on her forehead "Babylon the great." What is there
   "mystical" about this, in the sense of mysterious? Nothing. It means,
   as we have seen, a secret sign, but that refers to the "Woman" as being
   the sign or symbol of the "city."

   The war which is waged concerning that city in chap. xvii. tells us of
   its necessary revival. Chicago was once burnt, but in a very few years
   was entirely rebuilt. The difficulty arises from supposing that all
   these wonderful events are to be crowded into seven years, and no more.
   Whereas, after the "calling on high" of Phil. iii. 14, and the Parousia
   of 1 Thess. iv. and the "meeting of the Lord in the air," and the
   "gathering unto Him" there, there is practically, so far as we are
   concerned, no limit to the time which shall elapse before the actual
   Apocalypse of the Lord as "the King of Kings" (chap. xix.). Several
   events have to take place before the first half of the last seven years
   (Dan. ix. 27).

   The "end time" of Daniel is longer than this first half of the week,
   and commences before it.

   It begins with the appearance of the four Greek kings of Dan. vii. 17,
   23.

   According to Dan. xi. 5 (RV.), the King of Egypt precedes the king of
   the North. So that until this king of the North appears we have not
   reached the "end time."

   There are three kings of the north. First, the one who, before his
   accession, was one of the princes of the king of the South. This first
   king is engaged in many wars, which must occupy some considerable time.
   Upon his death he is succeeded by the one (Dan. xi. 20) who becomes
   "the seventh head," referred to in the Apocalypse as having been slain
   to death.

   From the rise of the first king of the North to the assassination of
   the one who is the seventh Head, appears the be the "end time"; and
   this includes the first-half of the last seven years.

   Upon the coming up of this seventh head from the Abyss as the eighth
   king, he immediately stops "the daily sacrifice."

   From this point to the end is the 42 months of Rev. and the "last days"
   of chap. x. 14, which belong to Dan. xi. 31 to end.

   The Sunteleia corresponds to the "end time" of Daniel.

   But the "calling on high" of Phil. iii. 14, and the "meeting" of 1
   Thess. iv. will both take place before it commences.

   If the length of this Sunteleia should be, say, 33 years, then the
   Telos would be the last seven years, making them 40 in all.

   Nothing whatever is said as to the length of this interval. But the
   analogy of the two Advents leads us to the belief that there will be a
   considerable period; and the end of "the times of the Gentiles" may be
   similar to their commencement.

   When Nebuchadnezzar first took Jerusalem, it remained for some twenty
   to thirty years, during which he set up and put down kings there (see 2
   Kings xxiv., xxv. Jer. xxxiv.--). It was not till the close of that
   long period that he finally burnt the City and the Temple and deported
   the people to Babylon. So it may easily be again. There may be thirty
   years or more from the rise of the Zionist movement, which will bring
   the Jews into a quasi national existence, before the last seven years
   which shall fulfil the prophecies of Dan. ix. 27.

   So that, from this point of view, time is no difficulty to our
   believing that the ten kings may burn the city (xvii. 16), and yet that
   it may revive and be destroyed suddenly, as in chap. xviii. The
   difficulty is not removed by the other interpretation; for how can
   anything "mystical" be burnt with fire?

   The Babylon, then, of this chap. xviii. is the Babylon of chap. xvii.
   and of all the other chapters which speak of her origin, her character,
   and her destiny. The "Kings of the Earth" did not thus become partakers
   of the idolatries of Pagan Rome: neither did the merchants of the earth
   wax rich through the merchandise of Papal Rome: nor were her adherents
   and votaries confined to "merchants" and "kings."

   This is literal Babylon; and before the Lord's advent (or Apocalypse),
   as described in chap. xix., takes place, she will have arrived at t his
   height of idolatry and luxury.

   It is strange that, in spite of all this, commentators still cling to
   the traditional interpretation that Babylon means Rome. Even Alford,
   after saying "Rome never has been, and from its very position never
   could be, a great commercial city," adds "I leave the difficulty
   unsolved." So there is a "difficulty"; but we submit that it is of the
   commentators' own creation. There is no difficulty if we believe what
   God says. But so loth are expositors to do this, that Alford says again
   "the details of this mercantile lamentation far more nearly suit
   London, than Rome, at any assignable period of her history."

   We believe that it is Babylon revived and restored (as other cities
   have been), and that this state of magnificence will characterise her
   in the day of the Lord's Apocalypse.

   Hence, the final announcement of her then impending judgment is
   followed by God's call to His people to come out of her.


   G^1, xviii. 4. God's people. Their call to come out of her.

   4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying

   "Come out of her, My people, That ye may not partake of her sins, And
   that ye receive not of her plagues.]

   There is no need for us to take this angel as being Christ. He speaks
   in the name of God, as in chap. xi. 3. His cry is a warning summons to
   God's people who will then be on the earth. The church will have been
   taken up some years before. And there will be others also who will have
   been safely caught up, and will give forth the rejoicing cry foretold
   in Rev. xii. 10. We have seen them in chaps. vii., xiv., and xv.,
   "standing before the throne," and upon mount Zion. But the "remnant of
   her seed" i.e., Israel's seed (chap. xii. 17) will have been taken to
   Babylon (Micah iv. 8-10); and to them, this warning cry is given. We
   need not wonder at many of them being found in Babylon; for, where
   merchandise is to be sold there will these be gathered together. It
   would be strange were it otherwise.

   And this is exactly what is foretold in Jer. l. There the destruction
   of Babylon is foretold; for it is "the word that the Lord spake against
   Babylon" (Jer. l. 1). We have not yet heard of any commentator who
   thought Jeremiah prophesied this of Rome, or of any city except the
   literal Babylon.

   Then, immediately after the announcement "Babylon is taken," we read
   "In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of
   Israel shall come; they, and the children of Judah together, going and
   weeping; they shall go and seek the Lord their God" (verse 4). "MY
   PEOPLE hath been lost sheep" (verse 6). To these the call will go
   forth, "Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the
   land of the Chaldean," (verse 8). And again, "Flee out of the midst of
   Babylon, and deliver every man his soul (i.e., let every man save his
   life): be not cut off in her iniquity: for this is the time of the
   Lord's vengeance"; he will render unto her a recompense (Jer. li. 6,
   and compare Rev. xviii. 6). And again, "MY PEOPLE, go ye out of her,
   and deliver every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord" (Jer.
   li. 45).

   Israel, as a nation, now repents (Jer. l. 4, 5). Therefore she is no
   longer "Lo-Ammi," "not my people." Hence this call is made "Come out of
   her, MY PEOPLE."

   This cannot refer to any but to the literal Israel, and to the literal
   Babylon. No such heavenly call ever went forth to any Christians in
   Rome. Nor did they come forth as a body. They have been slaughtered
   there; but that is a very different thing.

   It is Israel that is thus warned, as in Isa. xlviii. 20, and in Jer.
   li. 50, as we shall see below.

   In the sentence, "have no fellowship with her sins," the word "sins" is
   put by Metonymy for the judgment brought about by her sins. (Compare
   Jer. li. 9). It is because God's People will not have fellowship in her
   sins that this gracious call to "Come out" from her judgments is given.

   The cause of this judgment and of these plagues is now to be stated.


   F^2, xviii. 5-8. Babylon's judgment. Reasons for it.

   5. "Because her sins reached [372] up to heaven, and God remembered her
   iniquities.]

   This is a Hebraism. (Compare Gen. iv. 10; xix. 13. 2 Chron. xxviii. 9.
   Jer. li. 9. Jonah. i. 12). The length of time during which Babylon's
   sins have been accumulating is implied in this "remembrance." Compare
   chap. xvi. 19, "and great Babylon came into remembrance before God."
   This "remembrance" implies a former rebellion: a rebellion which was
   repressed by dispersion, but is at the time of the end to find in
   re-union, another opportunity for outbreak. Thus, in the very same
   place and under the same circumstances, defiance of God meets with its
   final judgment. This effectually shuts out Rome (Papal or Pagan); for
   Rome, though one of the daughters, is certainly not "the mother."

   6. Render to her
               As she also rendered [373] to others,
   And render double punishment [374]
               According to her works:
   In the cup which she mixed,
               Mix for her double.

   7. In proportion as she glorified herself,
                                   [and waxed wanton,
   So much torment and mourning
                                               [give to her:

   Is this call for vengeance given to the church? Certainly not! Nor does
   it belong to any period of history since the Lord's death; for the
   present is the day of grace, when God "maketh his sun to rise on the
   evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust"
   (Matt. v. 45). This proves that Rev. xviii. belongs to a future
   dispensation of judgment which has not yet come. Of that day, Ps.
   cxxxvii. 8, 9 may be applied, even though the interpretation may refer
   to past history:

   "O daughter of Babylon,
   Who art to be destroyed.
   Happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
   Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the
   rock" (RV).

   These words, so contrary to Christian sentiment, will be perfectly
   correct in the next dispensation, which will be one of judgment.

   The mingled cup refers us back to xvii. 4, and further identifies the
   two chapters. Babylon is now to drink another cup, herself. Compare
   Jer. li. 7, and especially chap. xxv., where the cup of God's wrath is
   sent to the nations (verses 15, 16), and Babylon drinks last (verse
   26).

   -7. "Because in her heart, she saith,

   'I sit a Queen, and a widow I am not; and mourning I shall in no wise
   see']

   These words are spoken of the same Babylon (not Rome) in Isa. xlvii. 8,
   9. The whole of that chapter is about Babylon "the daughter of the
   Chaldeans" (verses 1, 5).

   8. "For this cause, in one day, shall come her plagues--, and mourning,
   and famine (Isa. xlvii. 9); and with fire shall she be utterly burned
   up; because strong is the Lord God who judged [375] her.]

   This is the burning which has already been mentioned in chap. xvii. 16;
   but is now, in this chapter more fully described. Isa. xlvii. 9
   declares that this judgment shall come suddenly, "in a moment."

   This suddenness and completeness of Babylon's judgment and
   disappearance from the face of the earth is the one prominent feature
   of this prophecy: and it effectually proves that it has not yet taken
   place. For Jehovah's prophecies are far too accurate and particular for
   this suddenness and completeness to be fulfilled by the gradual decay
   of old Babylon, the site and ruins and remains of which are still to be
   seen in the land of Shinar.

   We now come to the Lamentation over her, and the member n^2 above must
   be expanded.

   It consists of eleven verses (xviii. 9-19); and these are elaborately
   constructed of four members, arranged as an Introversion. Each of the
   four larger members consists of three smaller ones, each perfect in its
   correspondence with the others.

   H. xviii. 9-10. The Lamentation of the Kings of the Earth over
   Babylon's fall.

   9. "And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and waxed
   wanton with her, shall weep, and wail over her, as soon as they see the
   smoke of her burning, (10) standing afar off on account of the fear of
   her torment, saying,

   'Alas, alas, the great city Babylon, the mighty city! for in one hour
   has thy judgment come.']

   These are "the kings of the earth" mentioned in xvii. 2; the
   confederates and associates of Babylon. In xviii. 3 the mourners over
   Babylon are first enumerated, and afterwards described more fully.
   [376]

   We have before noted that "the ten kings" are never seen apart from the
   Beast; and "the kings of the earth" are never seen apart from Babylon.
   It is the former who hate and burn Babylon; it is the latter who weep
   and wail over her. In both chapters (xvii. and xviii.) the city is
   called "Babylon the great." God and man both so call her.

   This great city cannot be separated from her own corrupt religion. They
   must be connected together, just as chapters xvii. and xviii. are
   connected; and yet distinguished as they are there distinguished.

   Idolatry of the grossest kind is Babylon's sin; and not commerce.
   Whoredom points to, and means, idolatry. That is Babylon's chief end.

   In commerce, goods of many are exchanged for the goods of others. But
   Babylon will not do that. She is only a buyer. What she gives to "the
   kings of the earth" and their peoples comes out of her "cup," and that
   stands for something having to do with religion: just as our Lord's Cup
   does. So Babylon's cup stands for corrupt religion, which has woman for
   its central object.

   We do not deny that the Church of Rome to-day is preparing for this
   Womanolatry; and, in all Roman Catholic countries, is fostering (not
   intentionally, it may be) a Womanolatry of a different kind, which is
   leading on that moral corruption which will end in a religious
   corruption of a similar kind.

   At the first, Babylon had male Gods. Later on, each male God was given
   a female partner, with the result that Ishtar became pre-eminent.

   This it is that makes the sin of Babylon; and it is this religion of
   Womanolatry which will be perfected in Babylon. It will be received by
   "the kings of the earth"; and the peoples of the kings of the earth
   will be taught it by an order of priests, just as were the people of
   Ephesus. But Babylon will be the great goddess. She will have her
   Temples the world over: "Mother of all the harlots." And this is the
   religion which is being prepared for even now.

   In any case, the common view of the chapter as relating only to
   "Commerce" must be modified. Babylon is a buyer. As a buyer, she cannot
   be regarded as engaged in Commerce, because that implies manufacture
   and selling as well as buying; and certainly buying with a view to
   selling again. But that is not Babylon. She sits, a woman, who buys to
   satisfy her lusts, and to furnish her allurements.

   Surely if Commerce were the point, Babylon would be represented as
   masculine, as Tyre is (Ezek. xxvi.--). A woman is not the ideal to
   represent Commerce in the ordinary acceptance of the word.

   But Mariolatry is increasing more and more, and is not now confined to
   Rome. And this is preparing the way for the revival of Ishtar. [377] It
   puts woman, as woman, at the head of the universe, teaching that which
   is a perversion of "the mother of all living." Is not this the only
   logical reason for the hatred of the Beast? Commerce does not furnish
   any adequate reason for this hatred.

   The great Question will be Supremacy. Who is to be supreme, Woman or
   Man; Babylon or the Beast? THAT is an all-sufficient reason for their
   hatred; and as the supremacy involved in Babylon is contrary to God's
   ordinance, He will "put it into their heart to destroy the woman."

   This view makes things much clearer than commerce can do. And if the
   sin of Babylon be as we have suggested, viz., a system which makes
   drunk with this false religious excitement the kings of the earth, the
   Priests and Priestesses, and Temple servers, then it is these who will
   be stripped of all their possessions and burnt with fire in every land
   where they are found. This will take place pre-eminently in Babylon.
   But before this takes place, the call will go forth to God's people to
   come out of her, that they be not partakers in her judgments.

   As this will take place in every land, the kings of the earth can stand
   afar off and wail; for, the superhuman Ten Kings and the Beast will
   dominate the world.

   The final judgment of Babylon will be sudden and complete. The
   conflagration will be so great that, from the first, total destruction
   will be seen to be inevitable.

   Three times this lament is made, "Alas! Alas! More literally, "Woe,
   woe," as elsewhere rendered in this book. But the AV. rendering is very
   expressive. The Kings of the earth make this lament. The Merchants make
   it (verse 16): and the Mariners make it (verse 19). In the first, the
   verbs introducing it are in the Future tense (verse 9): in the second,
   in the Present (verse 11), and in the third, the Past tense (verse 17).
   It is as though a moving scene is passing before the eyes, while the
   interjecting angel explains it.

   The lamentation of the merchants is divided into two parts. In J.
   (xviii. 11-14) the merchandise and its varieties are the subject: while
   in J. (xviii. 15-17) it is the merchants' irretrievable loss.


   J., xviii. 11-14. The Merchants' Lamentation.

   11. "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her; because no
   one any longer buyeth their cargo (Acts xxi. 3. Ex. xxiii. 5): (12) the
   cargo of gold, and of silver, and of precious stones, and of pearls,
   and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet, and all
   thyine wood, and every article of ivory, and every article of most
   costly wood, and of brass, and of iron and of marble, (13) and
   cinnamon, and spice, [378] and odours (for incense), and frankincense,
   and wine, and oil, and finest flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep,
   and of horses, and of chariots, and of slaves [379] and men. [380] (14)
   And the harvest of thy soul's desire departed from thee, and all the
   things that were dainty and brilliant have perished [381] from thee,
   and they (men) shall never more at all find them.]

   This list of the merchandise is most significant and instructive. We
   see at once that it consists entirely of luxuries (see verse 3). If
   Babylon be the Religious system, which we suggest, then her priests and
   priestesses in every land-- the harlot daughters of this harlot mother
   -- will deal in the same luxuries.

   It is not commerce that we see in this list. It is no exchange of
   produce against produce. There is no sin in that. That is a good thing,
   and not an evil thing. It is in her imports that the city is great; and
   these imports are luxuries (see verse 3).

   The articles of merchandise here are not enumerated in any hap-hazard
   way, but are arranged so as to impress us with the vast range and
   character of the commodities.

   They are arranged in four groups, and these are subdivided as
   follows:--

   Natural -- Adornment (12-) Jewellery.
                    Apparel (-12-) Drapery.

   Artificial -- All -- Vessels (-12) of Ivory
                                                         Wood
                                                         Brass
                                                         Iron
                                                         Marble

   Vegetable -- Aromatic (13-)
                        Nutritive (-13-)

   Animal -- Cattle (-13-)
                    Human kind (-13)

   These call for no comment beyond the great fact that they have no
   relation whatever to Rome, Pagan or Papal. Even Alford, who holds that
   Babylon in chap. xvii. means Rome, and is to be identified with chap.
   xviii., says, "It must not for a moment be denied that the character of
   this lamentation throws a shade of obscurity over the interpretation,
   otherwise so plain, from the explanation given in chap. xvii." We admit
   that, if we start with the assumption that in chap. xvii. we have Rome
   Papal, and in chap. xviii., Rome Pagan, there is a difficulty; for of
   neither could this lamentation ever be used. But the difficulty is
   created by an assumption. It is not in the Word. If we allow God to
   mean what He says, it is all clear. It is only when we assume that He
   means something quite different from what He says that we get into
   difficulties.

   Rome's merchants were never "the great men of the earth." Rome's
   religion is not based on astrology and sorcery. Well may Alford sum it
   up by saying, "I leave the difficulty unsolved:" and "the details of
   this mercantile lamentation far more nearly suit London than Rome at
   any assignable period of her history."

   "Babylon the Great" includes more than the city proper on the
   Euphrates. She sits upon many waters, and includes all the many peoples
   among whom her "Cup" passes.

   In verses 15-17- we have the merchants and their loss; rather than the
   merchants and the particulars of their merchandise.


   J., xviii. 15-17-. The Merchants and their loss.

   15. The merchants of these things (viz., in verses 12, 13), who were
   made rich by her, shall stand afar off on account of the fear of her
   torment, wailing and mourning, (16) [382] saying,

    "Alas! alas! the great city, which was arrayed in fine linens, and
   purple, and scarlet, and bedecked with gold, and precious stones, and
   pearls! (17-) for in one hour is so great riches come to naught.]

   The ruin is complete. It is even as was foretold of this very Babylon,
   "the beauty of the Chaldee's excellency shall be as when God overthrew
   Sodom and Gomorrah" (Isa. xiii. 19. Jer. xlix. 18; l. 40).

   We now come to the third great category of mourners, (1) the kings of
   the earth; (2) the merchants of the earth; and now (3) those upon the
   sea. The mercantile world includes both land and sea. The sea is indeed
   the chief factor in carriage and freights. Hence, those who have to do
   with the sea now make their lamentation.


   H., xviii. -17-19. The Lamentation of the Shipmasters.

   -17. And every shipmaster, and everyone that saileth any whither, [383]
   and mariners, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, (18) and
   cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying,

   "What city is like unto this great city?"

   (19) And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, wailing and
   mourning, saying,

   "Alas! alas! the great city, wherein were made rich all that had their
   ships in the sea, by reason of her costliness! [384] for in one hour is
   she made desolate."]

   The mention of passengers shows the nature and extent of the traffic;
   embracing travellers as well as merchants and traders. Rawlinson [385]
   speaks of the Euphrates as being navigable for ships for some 500 miles
   from its mouth. And with little effort could be made available for
   ships of large size.

   The "dwellers of the earth" judge by earthly size and grandeur; but God
   has a different standard, and sees that which shall bring down this
   tremendous judgment. These again are impressed with its suddenness; and
   remind us that no such sudden judgment has ever overtaken Babylon.

   God's people are again introduced; and the cry goes forth to "Rejoice
   over" Babylon on this hour of their avengement upon her (Ps. cxxxvii).


   G^2., xviii. 20. God's people. Their call to "Rejoice over her."

   20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, [386] and ye
   apostles, and ye prophets: for God hath executed your judgment (or
   avenged [387] you) upon her."]

   The command here given is obeyed in the next (the seventh and last)
   Vision "in heaven," and the words are given in chap. xix. 1-5. At
   length the waiting of the Martyrs is about to end (vi. 10-12), and they
   are to rejoice that God has avenged them. That avengement has now come
   (Luke xviii. 7, 8). This again shows that the dispensation of grace has
   ended, and that the coming dispensation of judgment has been entered on
   in this eighteenth chapter; yea, is about to close.

   Some commentators apologise for this rejoicing in vengeance; and
   endeavour to tone it down, as being inconsistent with the Gospel. Of
   course it is inconsistent with the Gospel; but this is because the
   dispensations are not the same. Once rightly divide the word of truth,
   and all difficulty is removed.

   Saints and apostles and prophets have been martyred in and by Babylon:
   both there, at its fountain head, as well as in some of its many
   streams by her daughters; for she is a "mother" and has daughters
   (xviii. 5).

   We now come to the final mention of this judgment, and are informed as
   to the manner of it, and the result of it.


   F^3., xviii. 21-23. Babylon's Judgment. The manner of it.

   21-23. And a mighty angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone,
   and cast it into the sea, saying,

   "Thus, with violence (or, with a rush) shall Babylon, that great city,
   be cast down, and Shall be found no more at all (Jer. li. 63. Ezek.
   xxvi. 21).
   And sound of harpers, and musicians, and flute players, and
   trumpeters,
           Shall never be heard in thee any
                                                       [more;
   And no craftsman, of any craft
           Shall ever be found in thee any
                                                       [more;
   And sound of millstone
           Shall ever be heard in thee any
                                                      [more;
   And the light of a lamp
           Shall never shine in thee any
                                                      [more:
   And the voice of the bridegroom or bride
           Shall never be heard in thee any
                                                     [more:
   Because thy merchants were the great ones of the earth: because by thy
   sorcery were all the nations deceived." (Is. xlvii. 8, 9).]

   Sorcery, corrupt religion, and idolatry are the great means by which
   Babylon will ensnare the nations. And these are the two things which
   are rising up and advancing before our eyes.

   The great stone represents the great city; and the symbolic act gives,
   with great vividness, the suddenness of Babylon's final destruction.
   Four times we have this suddenness emphasised:-- "in one day" (verse
   8), "in one hour" (verses 10, 17, 19). Every word is employed to
   impress us with its suddenness and completeness. And inasmuch as all
   other fulfilled prophecies have been fulfilled to the very letter; and
   Babylon, though fallen gradually, and very low, has never suffered such
   a destruction. There is only one conclusion, that in the interval of,
   say some 30 or more years between the removal of the church and the
   last "week" of Daniel's prophecy, it will be revived, and exceed all
   its former magnificence.

   Similar desolation was prophesied against Jerusalem, and the cities of
   Judah (Jer. vii. 34), but this was not to be like Babylon's. They were
   to be restored again (Jer. xxxiii. 10, 11). But no such restoration
   follows on the destruction of Babylon here described.

   And now we come to the last mention of God's People in connection with
   Babylon; and the whole scene closes with the one all embracing reason
   for this judgment.


   G^3., xviii. 24. God's people. Their blood found in her.

   24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of
   all the slain upon the earth.]

   With this we must read Jer. li. 49. "As Babylon hath caused the slain
   of ISRAEL to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the
   earth." This decides for us who the saints, apostles, and prophets are.
   They are "of Israel" (see verses 47, 48). But their blood is at length
   avenged, and that "speedily," with a mighty, and sudden, and complete
   avengement.

   [346] Fornication is everywhere in the Bible the common term used for
   the sin of idolatry, not only because it is unfaithfulness to God in
   forsaking Him, the true God, for the worship of false gods; but because
   it literally formed an essential part of all heathen idolatry. See Lev.
   xx. 5. Num. xxv. 1. 2 Chron. xxi. 11. Isa. i. 21; xxiii. 17. Jer. ii.
   20; iii. 1, 6, 8. Ezek. xvi. 15-17, 28, 29, 31, 34, 35, 41; xx. 30;
   xxiii. 5, 9, 43, 44. Hos. ii. 5; iii. 3; iv. 5, 10, 13-15. Mic. i. 7.

   [347] The article is often omitted after a preposition; and nothing can
   therefore be built upon its omission here.

   [348]        Ecclus. xxii. 22, "If thou hast opened thy mouth against a
   friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciling; excepting it be for
   upbraiding, and arrogance, and disclosing of a secret, and a
   treacherous blow: for these things every friend will flee."
           Ecclus. xxvii. 16, "He that revealeth secrets destroyeth
   credit: and shall never find a friend to his mind."
           Ecclus. xxvii. 17, "Love thy friend, and keep faith with him;
   but if thou reveal his secrets thou shalt not pursue after him."
           Ecclus. xxvii. 21, "A wound may be bound up; and after reviling
   there may be a reconcilement; but he that revealeth secrets hath lost
   hope."
           2 Maccabees xiii. 21, "But Rhodocus, from the Jewish ranks,
   made known to the enemy the secrets of his countrymen."
           Wisdom ii. 22, "And they (i.e., the wicked) knew not the
   secrets of God."
           Wisdom xiv. 23, "Slaughtering their children...or celebrating
   secret rites."
           Tobit xii. 7, 11, "It is good to keep close the secret of a
   king, but to reveal gloriously together the works of God."
           Judith ii. 2, "Nebuchadonosor called together all his servants,
   and all his great men, and communicated with them his secret counsel
   (lit., the secret of his will)"; i.e., his plan as to the campaign on
   which they were about to set out. This expression is remarkable: to
   musterion tes boules. In Eph. i. 9 we have a similar expression: to
   musterion tou thelematos, the mystery of his will. The words for "will"
   are different. With Nebuchadonosor it means that which he willed
   because he had determined to do it. With God (Eph. i. 9) it means that
   which He willed because He desired to do it-- i.e., His secret purpose,
   counsel, or plan.

   [349]         So in reference to the Paschal Lamb he says, "the
   mysterion therefore of the Lamb... was a type of Christ."
           Speaking of Isaiah vii. 14, "Behold a virgin shall conceive and
   bear a son," he says, "since this refers to the house of David, Isaiah
   has explained how that which was spoken by God to David, (...) (in a
   mystery), would actually come to pass. Perhaps," he adds, "you are not
   aware, my friends, of this-- that there were many sayings written (...)
   (epikekalumenos) obscurely; or (...) (en parabolais), in parables;
   (...) (musteriois), for secret signs; or (...) (en sumbolois), in
   symbols, which the prophets who lived after the persons who said or did
   them expounded" (Trypho, c. 68).

   [350] From the root (...) (chahnak), to initiate, to dedicate.

   [351] From (...) (babah), a gate, and (...) (El), God; in contrast with
   Bethel, the house of God.

   [352] From (...) (tzud) to lie in wait.

   [353] Dr. Seiss's Lectures on The Apocalypse, vol. iii., pp. 121-2.

   [354] L.A. WH. and RV. marg. read (...) (hupagei), goeth, instead of
   (...) (hupagein), to go.

   [355] L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read the singular number here.

   [356] The reading of the AV. ("and yet is") arises from a different
   division of the two words in this place. All the best MSS. and Critical
   Texts read (...) (kai parestai), and shall be present, instead of (...)
   (kapier estin), and yet is.

   [357] The word, in the case of individuals, is always used of violent
   death. See Judge. iii. 25; v. 27. 2 Sam. i. 19, 25. Violence is also
   true of kingdoms. Isa. xxi. 9. Jer. l. 15; li. 8. Ezek. xxix. 5; xxx.
   6.

   [358] See Babylonian Life and History, by Dr. Budge, of the British
   Museum. Published by the R.T.S., 1885.

   [359] As in Dan. i. 17; viii. 8, 22; x. 4; xi. 4.

   [360] As in Dan. iii. 25; vii. 7, 19, 23. These are all the occurrences
   of both words in the book of Daniel.

   [361] This is the meaning of the Chaldee (...) (tevar). The word occurs
   nowhere else, though there are some sixty other words rendered break.

   [362] And his superhuman stage will be for a similar period.

   [363] See Gen. v. 24, which explains this. As Enoch "was not" on the
   earth, but in heaven, whither he had been caught up: so it will be said
   of the Beast, he "is not" on the earth, because he will then have been
   cast down into the Abyss.

   [364] Same as note above.

   [365] The AV. does not translate the article, which forms part of the
   Textus Receptus, and G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit the (...) (kai), and.

   [366] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (kai) and, instead of (...)
   (epi), upon.

   [367] L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit (...) (kai) and.

   [368] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. add (...) (allon) another.

   [369] So G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV.

   [370] Tr. omits the second "fallen;" A. includes it in the text, but
   puts it in brackets.

   [371] L. and A. omit "the wine;" Tr. and WH. put it in brackets; the
   RV. puts it in the margin.

   [372] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (ekolle hesan) were joined or
   builded together; hence, reached, as buildings rise higher and higher;
   instead of (...) (ekolouthesan) followed.

   [373] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit (...) (humin) to you, so we must
   fill up the Ellipsis by supplying "to others."

   [374] Lit., "Double the double to her." This is the figure of Metonymy,
   by which the word "double" is put for completeness or full
   compensation. Compare Ex. xxii. 7, 9. Isa. xl. 2. Jer. xvi. 18; xvii.
   18.

   [375] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (krinas) judged, instead of
   (...) (krinon) judgeth.

   [376] This is the figure of Prosapodosis. See Figures of Speech, p.
   394.

   [377] Already, Commentators are fulfilling 2 Tim. iv. 4; and, turning
   away their ears from "the truth," are turned into "myths" (for that is
   the Greek word rendered "fables"). Winkler is quoted by Canon Cheyne
   with apparent approval, for he says, if scholars accept Winkler's
   teaching, he will accept their verdict. The latest theological "Myth"
   which commentators are turning to is this: viz., that Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob are lunar heroes. Sarah is at once Abraham's sister and his
   wife; because Sarah, being the counterpart of ISTAR, has a double rôle.
   She is the daughter of the Moon-god, and, therefore, Abraham's sister;
   and she is the wife of TAMMUZ, and, therefore, Abraham's wife. See
   Canon Cheyne in The Nineteenth Century Magazine for January, 1902.

   [378] G.L.Tr.A. WH. and RV. add (...) (kai amomum) and amomum, i.e.,
   and spice.

   [379] Greek, "bodies," put by Metonymy for slaves: just as we put
   "hands," for workmen.

   [380] Lit., "souls of men," a Hebraism for persons of men, or simply
   men (see Ezek. xxvii. 13. 1 Chron. v. 21, and Num. xxxi. 35, the Hebrew
   being (...) (nephesh adam). So Gen. xxxvi. 6, where, of course, the
   Hebrew is somewhat different.

   [381] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (apoleto) perishea instead of
   (...) (apelthen) departed.

   [382] G.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit (...) (kai) and.

   [383] i.e., the passengers. So G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV.

   [384] i.e., costliness including more than costly treasures; costly
   living as shown in extravagance.

   [385] Herodotus, i. 512.

   [386] So G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV.

   [387] Lit. "judged your judgment." This is the figure of Polyptoton,
   and is used for emphasis. It means hath fully avenged you.
     __________________________________________________________________

                         The Seventh Vision "In Heaven"

   H^7. Chap. xix. 1-16.
   The final heavenly Utterances and Actions.


   We now come to the last of the seven Visions seen "in Heaven," which is
   the subject of chap. xix. 1-16, giving us the final heavenly Utterances
   and Actions which lead up to, explain, and introduce the five
   concluding judgments which close up the things of Time, and pass on to
   what we call the Eternal State.

   This last Vision "in Heaven" is divided into two parts, each having its
   own independent construction. The first contains the words of the
   heavenly voices; and the second describes the actions of the heavenly
   beings.

   H^7. xix. 1-16. The Seventh (and last) Vision "In Heaven."

   H^7 |     P | xix. 1-10. The Final Heavenly Utterances.
             Q | xix. 11-16. The Final Heavenly Actions.

   These must be expanded in turn, in order to see the beauty and the
   scope of each.

   We have already called attention to the seventeen Heavenly Utterances
   in these seven Visions "in Heaven"; and pointed out that ten of them
   occur in the first and last together, viz., six in the first (chaps.
   iv. and v.), and four in the last (chap. xix. 1-10). All heaven seems
   to be moved at the first announcement and opening of these final
   judgments, which end in the ejection of the Usurper from the earth: and
   all heaven is stirred when we come to the final scenes of these
   judgments.

   It is only in the first and last of these Visions "in Heaven," that we
   have the utterances of the four Zoa. Only in the first announcement do
   they praise God that the time has at length come for Him to interfere
   in the affairs of this world, and wind up His great controversy with it
   and Satan. And again in chap. xix, when that great controversy shall
   have closed.

   Only on these two occasions, and in these two Visions do we hear their
   voices and listen to their significant utterances. In all the other
   Visions in Heaven they are silent.

   This shows us that we are approaching the end; and prepares us for the
   final Heavenly actions (xix. 11-16).

   The structure does not appear to be governed here by the utterances
   themselves. The heavenly excitement is not reduced to the order of
   literary form. Yet the structure, as a whole, is perfect, and the
   utterances are significantly marked by being alternated with
   prostration and worship: first, of the Elders; and then of John. This
   seems very marked, as does also the voice of the "great multitude."
   (See the Structure below).

   In A and A we have the first and fourth utterances, while in B and B we
   have the Harlot and the Wife set in strong and severe contrast; the
   smoke of the one in B, and the array and blessedness of the other in B.

   In C and C we have the prostration of the worshippers. In C that of the
   Elders; and in C that of John. This is combined with an exhortation in
   each case: addressed in C to the servants; and in C to John the
   fellow-servant.

   The four utterances themselves are arranged so that in the 1st and 4th
   we have the voices of many concerning the two symbolic women-- harlot
   and the wife; while in the 2nd and 3rd we have the voices from the
   Throne concerning God.

   x | Much people (concerning the harlot). (verses -1-3-).
           y | Elders and Zoa (worship of God). (verse 4).
           y | Voice from the Throne (praise of God). (verse 5).
   x | Great multitude (concerning the wife). (verses -6-7).

   It will be seen that in the two centre members we have the Throne and
   God for their subject. In the former we have the worship of God (verse
   4); and in the latter the praise of God (verse 5). In the former, the
   Elders and Zoa fall down before the Throne; in the latter, the Voice
   comes out of the Throne.

   In the first and fourth members (for these last four utterances are
   arranged as in Introversion) we have the correspondence of the "much
   people" of verse 1; and the "great multitude" of verse 6. We have also
   the vivid contrast between the destruction of the Harlot and the
   Blessedness of the Wife.

   This beautiful Structure shows us the importance of the subject which
   is to be set before us in this chapter; and the final Heavenly
   Utterances we are about to hear reveal to us the solemnity of the final
   judgments which are afterwards to be described.

   All is perfect; for all is Divine. The utterances close up the Divine
   communications; and the five concluding judgments close up the great
   Conflict, which began in Gen. iii. 15, and ends in Rev. xx.

   The following is the structure of the whole of the member P, xix. 1-10,
   containing the last four Heavenly Utterances:--

   P., xix. 1-10.  The Final Heavenly Utterances.

   P |     A |     a | xix. 1-.  The Voice of the great multitude.
                              b |     d | -1.  Hallelujah. (1st Utterance)
                                               e | 2, 3.  Reason.
                                                       B | -3.  The smoke
   and destruction of the Harlot.
                                                               C |     f |
   4.  Prostration of the Elders (2nd Utterance).

         g | 5.  Exhortation from the Throne (3rd Utterance) to the
   servants of God (Pos.).
           A |     a | xix. 6-.  The Voice of the great multitude.
                             b |     d | -6-7.  Hallelujah (4th Utterance)
                                               e | 7.  Reason.
                                                       B | 8, 9.  The
   array and blessedness of the Wife.
                                                               C |     f |
   -9, 10.  Prostration of John.

         g | -10.  Exhortation of Angel to John, his fellow servant
   (Neg.).


   a. xix. 1-. The Voice of the great Multitude.

   1-. [388] After these things I heard as it were [389] a loud voice of a
   great multitude in heaven, saying,]      This puts us on sure ground by
   notifying us that the Vision has returned again to, and is seen for the
   seventh and last time, "in Heaven." The voices which we are to listen
   to, and the words which we are to hear will prepare us for, and explain
   to us, all that is about to take place. Babylon had been destroyed, and
   the injunction had just gone forth, "Rejoice over her, O heaven"
   (xviii. 20). Here we have the obedience to the command, and all heaven
   rejoices. Babylon's inhabitants had cried "Alas! alas!" "Woe! woe!" Her
   merchants wailed and mourned because their market was gone. Now all
   heaven rejoices because deliverance had come; and they cry
   "Hallelujah... Hallelujah."


   b. xix. -1. The First Utterance.

   "Hallelujah! the Salvation, and [390] the glory, and the power of [391]
   our God are come"].

   The ascription is threefold, and not fourfold, if we omit "and the
   honour" with all the best and oldest manuscripts. The utterance is
   elliptical, for there is no verb. A verb, therefore, must be supplied.
   The RV and Alford supply "belong to," but this hardly agrees with their
   revised reading; otherwise we might supply be ascribed to. It seems
   almost better to leave the words as they stand above, and add, at the
   end, "are come." For this is what the utterance of the great multitude
   celebrates, in the reason, which is immediately added.

   This is the first occurrence of the word Hallelujah in the New
   Testament. It is a compound Hebrew word (...) (hallelu-jah) praise-ye
   Jah. It occurs altogether twenty-eight times in the Old and New
   Testaments, [392] vix., 24 in the Old Testament, and four in the New
   Testament.

   The Greek spelling in the New Testament is (...) allelouia; and the
   word is left untranslated. In the Old Testament the word is always
   translated "praise ye the Lord." Six times it is given in the margin,
   as in the Hebrew, Hallelujah (Ps. cxi. 1; cxii. 1; cxiii. 1; cxlvi. 1;
   cxlviii. 1; cl. 1). In the RV it is translated "praise ye the Lord,"
   and given always as Hallelujah in the margin, except once (cxxxv. 3).
   In the New Testament the Revisers do not translate it, but give it in
   the Text with the Hebrew spelling, "Hallelujah."

   The first occurrence of the word Hallelujah in the Old Testament
   corresponds in a marked manner with its first occurrence in the New
   Testament. We first find it in Ps. civ. 35.

   "Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth,
   And let the wicked be no more.
   Bless thou the Lord, O my soul.
   Hallelujah."

   So here, in Rev. xix. 1. The utterance begins and ends with the word
   "Hallelujah"; and Jah is praised for a similar reason, for at length is
   come the salvation and the glory and the power of God, manifested in
   the judgment of chap. xviii., and in xix. 11-16, when the sinners will
   be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked will be no more; and when
   God's people will be avenged.

   The utterance, beginning (verse 1) and ending (verse 3) with the same
   words, is the Figure Epanadiplosis, which emphasises the statement,
   marking it off as being as complete as it is important.

   Yes! it will have at length come. Salvation, with complete and final
   deliverance from Satan's usurpation in the earth.

   What the peoples of the earth lament over, the great multitude in
   heaven rejoice over. While they said "Alas! alas!" or "Woe! woe!" these
   say "Hallelujah!... Hallelujah!" So opposite is Heaven's estimate of
   the things of this world. It is thanksgiving for vengeance and
   avengement. It belongs, therefore, to the coming dispensation of
   judgment, and not to the present dispensation of grace.

   The church says "Hallelujah" now on earth (though, alas! it has become
   a common, not to say an almost unmeaning expletive, just as we say
   "hear, hear," to the words of mere mortals). Here, and in the Bible the
   word is associated with the most terrible judgments of God on the
   enemies of Himself and His people; and it is the shout of praise for
   complete avengement.


   e. xix. 2, 3-. The Reason.

   2. "for true and righteous are His judgments; for He hath judged the
   great harlot, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and He
   hath avenged the blood of His servants at her hand."

   3. And a second time they say (Greek, have said),

   "Hallelujah."]

   So that the special subject which moves all heaven to praise is that,
   judgment on Babylon is at length accomplished, and the blood of all the
   saints of God avenged.

   The reference here is to the "song of Moses" (Deut. xxxii. 43).

   "Rejoice, oh ye nations, with His people;
   For he will avenge the blood of his servants,
   And will render vengeance to His adversaries,
   And will be merciful to His land,
   And to His people."

   The cry had been (Rev. vi. 10): "How long, doest thou not, O Sovereign
   Lord, holy and true, judge and avenge our blood on the dwellers on the
   earth?"

   The Songs, and Praises, and Rejoicing are well uttered because at
   length this cry has been answered, and this judgment has come.


   B, xix. -3. The Smoke, and Destruction of the Great Harlot.

   -3. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.]      The destruction of
   the Great Harlot is set in contrast (by the structure) with verses 8
   and 9, where (in B) we have the array and blessedness of the wife). It
   is like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, which suffered "the
   vengeance of eternal fire." There are eternal fires which are
   unquenchable. This is the fire which will destroy Babylon as last. It
   is indicated in chap. xiv. 11 (see xviii. 9).


   f. xix. 4. The Prostration of the Elders: and Second Utterance.

   4. And the four and twenty elders and the four Zoa fell down and
   worshipped God, who sitteth upon the throne, saying,

   "Amen: Hallelujah!"]

   The elders now appear again. We have seen, above (on chap. v. 9, 10),
   that they are not the church, nor are they men, nor are they redeemed;
   though they speak of redemption. This is the last time they are
   mentioned. They come before us when the Throne is set for judgment.
   They appear no more after that judgment has been accomplished. They
   merely but significantly say "Amen," -- acquiescing in all that has
   been done; "Hallelujah" -- praising Jehovah that avengement is at
   length completed. Their prostration is set in correspondence with the
   prostration of John in "f," verse 10; and, as an exhortation is there
   given to John the fellow-servant, so here, to the servants of God, is
   given the


   g. xix. 5. Exhortation to Praise.

   5. And a voice came forth from the throne, saying,

   "Give praise to our God, all ye His servants (Ps. cxxxiv. 1);
   And ye that fear Him, both small and great (Ps. cxv. 13).]

   Here we have two distinct references to the Psalms, which show that the
   interpretation to be put on these words must be in connection with
   God's earthly People; for this is the People and the Time to which the
   Psalm refers. God's judgments are still the subjects of praise. We are
   not told from whom the Voice comes; only that it comes from the place
   of authority. Of the coming King, when in His humiliation, it was
   prophesied (Ps. xxii. 22, 23, 25);--

   "I will declare thy name unto my brethren:
   In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
   Ye that fear the Lord, praise him;
   All ye of the seed of Jacob, glorify him;
   And fear him, all ye of the seed of Israel."

   The reason is given in verses 27, 28:

   "For the kingdom is the Lord's;
   And he is the governor among the nations."

   Now will have come the moment of the fulfilment of Matt. v. 10, 12.
   "Blessed are those which are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for
   theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for
   great is your reward in heaven."

   It can hardly be the voice of Christ, for He does not associate Himself
   with us in this relationship. On the contrary, He distinguished Himself
   from His people, and says, "My Father and your Father; my God and your
   God" (John xx. 17). See Heb. ii. 11.


   a, xix. 6, 7. The Voice of the great Multitude and the Fourth
   Utterance.

   6, 7. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as it
   were the voice of many waters, and as it were the voice of many
   thunders, saying,

   "Hallelujah! For the Lord our [393] God, the omnipotent, reigneth.
   Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad,
   And give the glory unto Him:
   For the marriage of the Lamb is come.
   And his wife hath made herself ready."]

   We can never have a clear understanding of this heavenly utterance if
   we introduce the Church of the Pauline Epistles, i.e., the Great
   Mystery, here.

   One would have though it quite unnecessary to make this statement,
   considering that we have so many references to Israel, or Israel's
   elect remnant, in the Old Testament. And these, quite irrespective of
   the Church of God which is the subject of subsequent revelation.

   As to the relationship of God with Israel, it is the resumption of a
   former relationship. The Old Testament Scriptures speak of the marriage
   between the Lord and His People again and again. As to the Church of
   God, the New Testament Scriptures state, as clearly as possible, that
   it was "hid in God." Mark, it does not say, hid in the Scriptures, but
   "hid in God," Himself. It is impossible, therefore, that the Mystery,
   of the Church of God, can be spoken of or revealed in the Old
   Testament.

   Did pious Jews think of the Church of God when they read in Isa. liv.
   5-8?

   "Thy Maker is thy husband;
   The Lord of hosts is his name,
   And thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel.
   The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
   For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
   spirit,
   And a wife of youth, when thou was refused, saith thy God.
   For a small moment have I forsaken thee:
   In a little wrath I hid my face from thee,
   But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
   Lord, thy Redeemer." (Isa. liv. 5-8).

   Did they understand the Church when they read in Isa. lxii. 4, 5?

   "Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken,
   Neither shall thy land be any more termed Desolate:
   But thou shalt be called Hephzibah (i.e, my delight is in her),
   And thy land Beulah (i.e., married).
   For the Lord delighteth in thee,
   For as a young man marrieth a virgin,
   So shall thy sons possess [394] thee;
   And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
   So shall thy God rejoice over thee." (Isa. lxii. 4, 5).

   What did they understand, as they read Hosea ii. 16, and Jer. iii. 14?

   "It shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that thou shalt call me Ishi
   (i.e., my husband.)
   And shalt no more call me Baali (i.e., my lord)...
   And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; ...
   I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness,
   And thou shalt know the Lord." (Hosea ii. 16, 19).

   "Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord,
   For I am married unto you." (Jeremiah iii. 14).

   This marriage is referred to in Isa. iv. 5. When Jehovah shall have
   purged away the filth of the daughters of Zion, it is added: "beyond
   all this glory there shall be the Chuppah": i.e., the marriage or
   bridal canopy mentioned elsewhere only in Ps. xix. 5, and Joel ii. 16;
   and referring to Isa. lxii. (quoted above). The chuppah is the bridal
   canopy beneath which Jewish nuptial ceremonies are performed to this
   day.

   Why are we to do away with all these references by interpreting them in
   a way in which the original readers could never have understood them?
   Either they must have been wrong in understanding them of Israel, or we
   must be wrong in interpreting them of the Church of God. Both cannot be
   right.

   The "wife" is earthly (xix.): the "Bride" is heavenly (xxi.).

   The marriage of the one is on earth (though rejoiced over in heaven
   beforehand), and is consummated on earth for 1,000 years. All earthly
   or mortal relationships must run out by expiration along with the
   earth, before the other, the heavenly relationships, are entered upon.
   Thus, understanding Rev. xix. of Israel, and xxi. of the Elect Remnant,
   there is neither Polygamy on the one hand, nor Divorce on the other.

   It is important to observe the various callings.

   (1) There is the "earthly calling," which all Israel shares -- the
   Wife, (...) (gune), Rev. xix. ("The sand," of Gen. xiii. 16);

   (2) there is the "heavenly calling" of an elect remnant of Israel --
   the Bride, (...) (numphe), Rev. xxi. 9 ("The stars," of Gen. xv. 5);
   and

   (3) there is the distinct calling of the Church of God -- which is "The
   Christ" (i.e., the Mystery).

   These three distinct callings have their separate standings; their
   different hopes, different promises, and different destinies.

   We must rightly divide these "callings," or we shall get only
   confusion.

   How, for example, can it be said of the Church that she "hath made
   herself ready." As members of the Body of Christ we are already "made
   meet" (Col. i. 12); God Himself hath made us meet: and even now we are
   "complete in Him" (Col. ii. 10); and are "perfect in Christ Jesus"
   (Col. i. 28); "accepted in the Beloved" (Eph. i. 6).

   We can never be more "ready" than He Himself hath made us. The language
   in Rev. xix. 7 is wholly foreign to the perfect standing of the church,
   which is in grace.

   The next verse also shows this very clearly, where we have


   B, xix. 8, 9. The array and Blessedness of the Wife.

   8. And it was given to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen
   raiment, bright and pure: for the fine linen raiment is the righteous
   awards of the saints.]      The word rendered "righteousness" is not
   (...) (dikaiosune), the state or quality or condition of righteousness;
   but it is (...) (dikaioma); a righteous act.

   It is in the plural here, and denotes the righteousness of the things
   indicated by the context.

   In Luke i. 6 it is righteous ordinance.
       Rom. i. 32, righteous sentence.
               ii. 26, righteous requirement of the Law.
               v. 16, righteous acquittal.
               v. 18, righteous work.
               viii. 4, righteous requirement.
       Heb. ix. 1, 10, righteous ordinances.
       Rev. xv. 4, righteous sentence,

   and here in Rev. xix. 8, it denotes the righteous awards. The RV and
   Rotherham put "righteous acts." But "acts" are not "given." Whatever
   the word refers to, here, is said to be "given to her." And what was
   given was given by way of reward, or better, as awards. Alford and
   Tregellis render it "righteousness," as in the AV. Alford says "it is
   their own, [395] inherent, not imputed." The Scripture here declares it
   was theirs because it was "given." They would say, we are sure in the
   words of Isa. lxiv. 6: "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."
   This is, and ever will be, the common confession of all justified ones.
   It cannot be, as many hold, that it is their own inherent righteousness
   in men of any dispensation; for the universal verdict was, and is,
   "there is none righteous, no not one."

   The same angel goes on to describe, not merely the array of the Bride,
   but the blessedness of those who shall be called to the marriage.

   9-. And he saith to me, Write, "Blessed are they that are called unto
   the marriage supper of the Lamb."]      Thus we not only have the Wife;
   but as in Ps. xlv. 14, "the virgins, her companions"; and also those
   who are the invited guests. As "star differeth from another star in
   glory" (1 Cor. xv. 41), so the people in glory differ in ranks and
   orders and degrees; but all, all-glorious, in the "many mansions."

   Just as in an earthly family there are the Husband, the Wife, the
   Children, the Relatives, the Friends, the Visitors, and the Servants,
   yet all in the same mansion and all one household; so in the glory
   there will be the Christ and the Church which is His Body; the Lamb and
   the Lamb's wife; the "friends of the Bridegroom" (John iii. 29); the
   "virgins" that be the Bride's "companions" (Ps. xlv. 14); those who are
   "called" to the marriage supper; the "servants"; the great multitude of
   Rev. vii.; the 144,000 of sealed ones; and of all, it is true, that
   they are "blessed." For the angel goes on at once to announce this in
   the most solemn and formal manner, which calls forth the adoration of
   John.


   f., xix. -9-10-. The Prostration of John.

   -9. And he saith to me, "These are the true words of God."]      The
   angel is the speaker of xvii. 1. Thrice is the assurance given (xix.
   10; xxi. 5; xxii. 6), showing that it refers to the immediate context.

   10-. And I fell down before his feet to worship him.]      Twenty-four
   times is the word (...) (proskuneo) used in the Apocalypse, and we
   ought, before this, to have pointed out that when followed by the
   Accusative case it means merely to do homage or obeisance to another,
   as from man to man. When used with the Dative case it means to worship
   with Divine honour. [396] This shows that John, here, was going to give
   the angel Divine worship, which was, of course, at once forbidden, as
   it is also in xxii. 8.


   g., xix. -10. Exhortation of the Angel to John.

   -10. And he saith to me "See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with
   thee, and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: Worship
   God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."]      What
   the angel says is, I am a servant as well as thou, and therefore I
   cannot receive the worship which is due only to God. Both the angel and
   John are sent on the same business, are engaged in the same matters,
   and are witnesses of the same truth: the one, therefore, cannot worship
   the other. Both were fellow-servants of John's brethren. Both were
   engaged in the same work. The angel was explaining and John was
   writing, so that John's brethren might learn and know these true
   sayings of God. We cannot determine whether "the testimony of Jesus"
   should be taken objectively as testimony concerning Jesus; or
   subjectively of testimony borne or sent by Him: as in i. 1. Probably
   both are true, and it is often better to take the inclusive meaning.
   All prophecy concerns in some way the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the
   spirit of it: yea, the sum and the substance of it. He Himself is the
   prophet. He bore His prophetic testimony concerning these things when
   on earth, in the Parables of the Kingdom, the Marriage Supper, and in
   the last great Prophetic discourse concerning the Great Tribulation:
   and now it is given to Him to show unto His servants the things which
   are yet to come to pass.


   Q. xix. 11-16. The Final Heavenly Actions.

   The Seventh (and last) Vision in heaven is divided, as we have seen
   into two parts, the former consisting of Utterances only; and the
   latter of Actions. In xix. 1-16 we have the Utterances, which we have
   been considering. In xix. 11-16 we have the Actions described. They are
   arranged as follows:--

   Q |     C | 11. The Rider on the white horse.
                   D | 12, 13. His description.
             C | 14. His followers: "the armies of heaven."
                   D | 15, 16. His further description.


   C. xix. 11. The White Horse and his Rider.

   11. And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
   sat thereon was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He doth
   judge and make war]      Here, at length, we have the actual Apocalypse
   of the Messiah. We see him coming forth in all His power and glory. He
   is not named, but He is described by those attributes which suit His
   action. He is "Faithful" to all the promises He has made; "True" to
   execute all the judgments He has threatened. The "war" which He will
   make is righteous. The similarity of this white horse and his rider has
   led many interpreters to identify him with one mentioned in chap. vi.
   2. But there is no necessity for this. There is a likeness; but there
   is a contrast, also. That was the false Christ; this is the true
   Christ. The former was neither faithful nor true; the latter is both.
   The one will go forth in order to conquer and subdue all to himself;
   the other will go forth to judge and make war upon the former in
   righteousness. There is neither judgment nor making war in the rider of
   vi. 2: his object is simply to overcome, conquer and subdue. But here
   it is judgment; and an aggressive war which shall accomplish that
   judgment.

   Many stumble at the White Horse and his rider here; and ask, in
   amazement, whether we really believe it? We answer, Yes! We believe it,
   just as we believe the prophecy in Zechariah ix. 9, about the coming of
   that same Blessed One riding upon an ass, and the fulfilment of that
   prophecy in Matt. xxi. 4-11.

   The Jews probably stumbled at the Prophecy of Zechariah in the same
   manner, as being improbable. But all is easy to faith.

   It is as easy to believe one prophecy as the other, and we believe
   both.

   Then, He came in humiliation. Now, He will come in glory, even as Psalm
   xlv. 3-6 testifies.

   "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty,
   [And gird thyself] with glory and majesty,
   And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and
   righteousness;
   And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
   Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;
   The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre."

   All this stands in connection with His marriage with His wife as it
   does here, in Rev. xix.

   The prophecy in Zechariah ix. takes in both Comings. The coming to
   Jerusalem in humility (verse 9), and the judgment which he will execute
   at His second Coming; for, the next (the 10th) verse goes on to say:--

   "And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,
   And the horse from Jerusalem,
   And the battle bow shall be cut off:
   And He shall speak peace unto the heathen;
   And his dominion shall be from sea even to sea,
   And from the river even unto the ends of the earth."


   D. xix. 12, 13. His Description.

   12. And His eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon His head were many
   diadems: and He had a name written, that no one knew, but He Himself.
   (13) And He was arrayed with a garment dyed [397] (or stained) with
   blood; and his name is called "The Word of God"].      The reference to
   blood here is clearly to Isa. lxiii. 1-6, where this same mighty
   conqueror is seen coming up from Edom: his garments being stained with
   the blood of his enemies. We have two Questions with their Answers:

   Qu.-- "Who is this that cometh from Edom
               With dyed garments from Bozrah?
               This that is glorious in his apparel,
               Travelling in the greatness of his strength?

   Ans.-- I that speak in righteousness, [I that am] mighty to save.

   Qu.-- Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, And thy garments like
   him that treadeth in the winefat?

   Ans.-- I have trodden the wine-press alone;
               And of the people there was none with me:
               For I will tread them with my fury;
               And their blood shall be sprinkled on my garments,
               And I will stain all my raiment.
               For the day of vengeance is in mine heart,
               And the year of my redeemed is come.
               And I looked, and there was none to help;
               And I wondered that there was none to uphold:
               Therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me;
               And my fury, it upheld me.
               And I will tread down the people in mine anger,
               And make them drunk with my fury,
               And I will bring down their strength to the earth."

   The whole scene is one of judgment and of vengeance (compare Is. ix.
   5). How any could ever understand this as referring to, or foretelling,
   the Redeemer's sufferings in grace, we cannot imagine. No! This is the
   language of the Gospels, where the Lord, referring to this very
   judgment scene, exclaims, "Those mine enemies, who would not that I
   should reign over them, bring them hither and slay them before me"
   (Luke xix. 27). The Rider on the white horse is not the Gracious
   Saviour in His work of saving His people from their sins; but the
   Righteous Judge who avenges them on their enemies.

   His name is called "the Word of God." This connects Him with His
   attribute of Creator (Ps. xxxiii. 6); with the Eternal One (John i. 1,
   2); and with the Incarnate One (John i. 14).

   He leads the Armies of Heaven, and these, in the Structure above, are
   set in correspondence with Himself as coming forth from Heaven.
   (Compare C. and C.).


   C. xix. 14. His followers. The Armies of Heaven.

   14. And the armies which [398] are in heaven followed him upon white
   horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure]      "Behold, the Lord
   cometh with ten thousands of His saints (or holy ones) to execute
   judgment upon all" (Jude 14, 15). This was the primitive subject of
   prophecy; and this is the spirit of its testimony concerning Jesus.
   There is no need to introduce the Church here. It will be with Christ.
   For ever united to its glorious Head, not separated from Him into
   "Armies." These are angelic hosts who are accustomed to "make war" (see
   chap. xii), and fight against Satan and his hosts.

   All here is a grand reality. These armies are no mere symbols. Horses
   and chariots of fire were seen by Elisha's servant at Dothan when his
   eyes were "opened." Horses of fire took Elijah into heaven. These were
   real; and what they accomplished was real also. It is neither necessary
   nor wise to explain away any portion of God's Word. Neither is it safe:
   for there are many things in heaven and earth which have never entered
   into man's imagination; and it is childish and absurd to measure and
   judge of everything by our own limited experience. Things are not
   unreal, unlikely, or impossible merely because we have never seen them.
   It is both wiser and safer to believe God. If any ask, "Do you then
   believe that these are real armies and real horses?" we answer, Most
   certainly! The Word of God declares it in language that does not admit
   of Figures of Speech.

   For our part, we find it easier and happier to accept those statements
   in all simplicity; assured that it is much more pleasing in God's
   sight, than to explain away His revelation merely because some things
   are different from anything we happen to have heard of before.

   These Angelic armies take their place as opposed to the Satanic armies.

   We have Anti-Christ against Christ.
   Angels against angels.
   Superhuman beings against glorified saints.
   Mortals against mortals.

   The whole kingdom of God opposed to the whole kingdom of Satan.


   D, xix. 15, 16. Further Description of Messiah.

   15. And out of His mouth proceedeth a sharp sword (see i. 16; ii. 12,
   16), that with it (as invested with it) He should smite the nations:
   and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the
   winepress of the fierceness [399] of the wrath of God the Almighty.
   (16) And He hath upon His vesture and on His thigh a name written,
   "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."]      All judgment is committed unto
   Him; and "by the breath of His lips He shall slay the Wicked One."
   Chap. xvi. has already prepared us for the conflict. Chap. xvii. has
   shown us the enemy and his allies. Chap. xviii. gave us details of the
   judgment as regards "Babylon the great." But now we have, at length,
   the final fulfilment of the second Psalm. The nations rage and are
   smitten. The treading of this winepress had been foreshown in chap.
   xiv. 19, 20. The Gentiles at last have all power taken from them. "The
   times of the Gentiles" will have reached their end. For, all government
   will then be at length centred, and settled for ever, in "the Prince of
   the Kings of the Earth," "the King of Kings and Lord of Lords."

                    The Seventh (And Last) Vision "On Earth"

   E^7, xix. 17&151xx. 15.
   THE FINAL FIVE JUDGMENTS.


   We must get a complete view of these in order to embrace them all and
   view them as a whole.

   The Structure shows their true sequence:

   E^7., xix. 17-- 15.  The Seventh (and Last) Vision "on Earth."

   E^7 |     A^1 | xix. 17-21. MEN. The Judgment of the Beast and the
   False Prophet.
                   B^1 | xx. 1-3. SATAN. The Judgment of Satan (Before the
   Millennium).
             A^2 | xx. 4-6. MEN. The Judgment of the overcomers. The "rest
   of the dead" left for Judgment.
                   B^2 | xx. 7-10. SATAN. The Judgment of Satan (After the
   Millennium).
             A^3 | xx. 11-15. MEN. The Judgment of the Great White Throne.

   From this Structure we see that these judgments are arranged
   alternately, as they affect Men and Satan: thus completing the 7th
   Seal, the 7th Trumpet, and the 7th Vial, finishing the "mystery" or
   secret purpose of God concerning Satan and Man; Jew and Gentile; Heaven
   and Earth.

   These judgments embrace the setting right of what is wrong; the setting
   up of what is good; and the putting down and final destruction of all
   that is evil.

   Each of these five Scriptures has its own peculiar Structure, which we
   propose to give in their due order.

   The following is the Structure of

   THE FIRST JUDGMENT.

   A1, xix. 17-21. The Judgment of the Beast and the False Prophet.

   A^1 |     C | 17-. The Angel in the Sun.
                   D | -17, 18. The Angel's proclamation.
              C | 19. The Beast and his Confederacy on Earth.
                   D | 20, 21. Fulfilment of the Angel's cry.


   C, xix. 17-. The Angel in the Sun.

   17-. And I saw one-- angel-- standing in the Sun;]      And angel
   proclaimed the fall of Babylon, and now an angel proclaims the
   destruction of the Beast and his confederacy. From this grand and
   exalted position, unreachable by any earth-born being, goes forth the
   proclamation, and reaches all the earth.


   D, xix. -17, 18. The Angel's Proclamation.

   -17. And he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly
   in mid-heaven,

   "Come, be gathered [400] together unto God's great supper; [401]
   (18)that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of
   chief-captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses,
   and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all, both free and bond,
   both small and great."]

   So Ezekiel had been told to cry, chap. xxxix. 17-22, where the cry is
   made concerning this or a subsequent [402] period, when the Prince of
   Rosh (Russia) and Meshech (Moscow) and Tubal (Tobolsk) will come
   against Israel in the days of the Antichrist.

   The scene in Rev. xix. -17, 18 is occupied with the Beast and the False
   Prophet and their confederacy. Beasts of the earth are not summoned
   here, as they are in Ezekiel; for this cry goes forth from the sun, and
   is to be immediately and universally obeyed. This could be done only by
   flying creatures. The feast in Ezekiel is more local, and hence the
   beasts of the earth are summoned.

   The issue of this battle is never in any doubt. It is fore-announced.
   The description is yet to be recorded. The call to devour the carcasses
   of the slain is given before the battle has begun. The marriage supper
   of the Lamb has just been celebrated in heaven, and now the great
   supper of God is furnished for the fowls of heaven and the beasts of
   prey on the earth.


   C, xix. 19. The Beast and his Confederacy.

   19. And I saw the Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies,
   gathered together to make war with Him that sitteth on the horse, and
   with His army.]      Unclean spirits gather the kings of the earth to
   fight in xvi. 12-16. A holy angel summons the birds to devour them.
   "The kings of the earth," who opposed the Beast, now unite with him to
   fight against God. "Strong delusion" is upon them now, "that they
   should believe the lie, that they all might be damned..." (2 Thess. ii.
   9-12). Hence: with one accord, this vast confederacy, having subdued
   the earth, now prepares to resist all heaven. "The heathen rage, and
   the people imagine a vain thing. The kings of the earth set themselves,
   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His
   anointed." (Ps. ii. 1-3). Here we see them gathered together to
   complete their subjugation of the earth and shut out its rightful
   owner.

   But the issue is not kept long in suspense.


   D. xix. 20, 21. The fulfilment of the angel's cry.

   20. And the Beast was taken, and with him the False Prophet who wrought
   the miracles before him (xiii. 11-17), with which he deceived those
   that had received the mark of the Beast, and those who worshipped his
   image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burneth
   with brimstone. (21) And the rest were killed with the sword of him
   that sitteth upon the horse, which sword proceedeth out of his mouth:
   And all the birds were satiated with their flesh.]      The Beast and
   the False prophet therefore are no mere systems, no mere companies of
   men. They are superhuman, but they are as truly men as Judas and
   Mahomet were men. They will be cast "alive" into the lake of fire. If
   these be not individual beings, then language is useless for the
   purposes of revelation.

   They are real persons, as are those who will receive the mark of the
   Beast, and worship his image. They receive their punishment together.
   They cannot be slain, now, as mortals.

   They will have come up from the Abyss; and they are still found alive
   in the lake of fire at the close of the thousand years (xx. 10). The
   armies being mortals are slain; and their dead bodies are eaten by the
   fowls of the air. There are none to bury them.

   Thus ends the first of these final five judgments.


   THE SECOND JUDGMENT.

   The outcome of the first of these final five judgments is the binding
   of Satan. The judgment of the Beast and the False Prophet and their
   Confederacy is not enough. He who was planned all, and used all for the
   accomplishment of his purposes, must now be dealt with. The chief
   instigator of all the evil must now be deprived of all further
   opportunity of attempting to frustrate the counsels and purposes of
   God. He has been cast out of heaven: he must now be cast out of the
   earth.

   The structure of the passage which describes this judgment is as
   follows:--

   B^1, xx. 1-3. The Judgment of Satan (Before the Millennium).

   B^1 |     E^1 |     a^1 | xx. 1, 2-. The binding of Satan. (The Key and
   the Chain).
                               b^1 | xx. -2. Time. (1,000 years).
              E^2 |    a^2 | xx. 3-. Satan bound. (The Abyss and the
   Sealing).
                               b^2 | xx. 3-. Time. (1,000 years).
              E^3 |    a^3 | xx. -3-. The loosing of Satan.
                              b^3 | xx. -3. Time. ("a little season").

   This Structure consists of three pairs. The first of each pair has to
   do with Satan and his binding; and the second with its duration.

   xx. 1. And I saw an angel descending out of heaven, having the key of
   the Abyss, and a great chain in his hand. (2) And he laid hold of the
   dragon,-- the old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him
   a thousand years, (3)and cast him into the Abyss, and shut him up, and
   set a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations any longer,
   until the thousand years be completed: Afterward he must be loosed a
   little season.]      Who this angel is does not concern us. If it did,
   we should have been told. Speculation here is worse than useless. It is
   enough for us to know that it will indeed be a mighty angel to
   accomplish this business. Satan is a personality; a spirit-being. He
   can be seized, and will be bound; just as his subordinate angels have
   already been, and are now reserved for future judgment under "chains of
   darkness" and "everlasting chains" (2 Pet. ii. 4. Jude 6). There are
   chains that can bind flesh and blood; and there are chains that can
   bind spirits. We are asked, with a triumphant air: "Do you really
   believe Satan will be bound with an iron chain?" Our answer is, that
   there is not a word said about an "iron chain"! Our imagination and
   knowledge are so limited, that when God says "a great chain," we can
   think only of an "iron" chain, because the chains that we know of are
   mostly iron. But we are having great and wondrous facts and realities
   revealed to us here; and it behoves us to believe, were we cannot
   understand. It becomes us, as the recipients of such a revelation, to
   humbly receive it, and not to criticise it.

   The grand reality is, that Satan will one day be "bound"; and he will
   be bound with something that can bind him. He will be cast into the
   Abyss; and, in spite of his being a spirit-being, he will not be able
   to get out, or "walk about" (1 Pet. v. 8) as before. When this blessed
   fact is revealed to us, it is for us, not to reason about it, but to
   praise God for the wondrous news, and sing:

   "O what a bright and blessed world
           This groaning earth of ours will be,
   When, from its throne, the Tempter hurled,
           Shall leave it all, O Lord, for Thee?"

   That is to be our attitude. We believe that the War is literal; the
   taking of the Beast and the False Prophet is literal; Satan is literal,
   and his binding is literal. It does not say he will be bound with a
   steel chain, or an iron chain; but it says "a great chain." It will be
   a chain of Divine make, and it will be suitable for-- will effectually
   accomplish-- great object.

   How all this can be done we do not know; nor are we called upon to
   show. There are such things as Figures of Speech; but this is not one,
   nor is it what commentators call "figurative language," that cannot
   bind anyone, except themselves and others, to their false system of
   interpretation. In Rev. xiv. 14, 15 we read of a "Sickle"; but Matt.
   xiii. 30, 39-42 shows that it denotes a grand and dread reality. So the
   "great chain" does here.

   The Abyss is literal; as is the lake of fire. Satan is to be cast into
   the Abyss (from whence the Beast came, xvii. 8), for 1,000 years, when
   he will join the Beast and the False Prophet in the lake of fire (xx.
   10).

   There is another place called "Tartarus" (2 Pet. ii. 4) -- unless
   Tartarus is another name for the Abyss. This is where the fallen Angels
   are bound (1 Pet. iii. 18, 19. 2 Pet. ii. 4. Jude 6). [403]

   In the face of all these great, solemn, and grand realities, it is sad
   to notice the fanciful interpretations put upon them.

   Some maintain that this binding took place at the beginning of the
   Christian Dispensation. In that case the Millennium was over nearly
   1,000 years ago, and we call that very period "the dark ages." In that
   case also Peter was inspired to say that Satan "walketh about" (1 Pet.
   v. 8) on earth, while he was bound in the Abyss!

   Some assert that the binding took place at the conversion of
   Constantine. But that was the beginning of all that has led to the
   corruption and apostasy of the Church.

   Others hold that whenever the binding took place, Satan is bound now.
   Such can never read the newspapers, which teem with little else than
   the most awful evidences to the contrary, both of crimes in the world
   and of corruption in the Church.

   Others maintain that the 1,000 years are not literal but mean any
   prolonged period.

   If the year-day theory is to be consistently held, then we have a
   period of at least 360,000 years during which Satan is bound.

   After the 1,000 years Satan "must be loosed a little season." The
   consideration of why this "must be" we will defer till we come to verse
   7. Meantime, the Structure binds us consider first the blessedness of
   the Millennial state on earth.


   THE THIRD JUDGMENT.

   The third, or central judgment of the last five differs from the two
   that precede and follow it, in that it is a judgment of vindication and
   award, and not of condemnation and punishment.

   Its subject are the Overcomers: and by its Structure it is divided into
   six members, grouped in three pairs: Persons alternating with the
   duration of Time, as in the previous Structure concerning Satan:--

   A^2. xx. 4-6. Judgment given to the Overcomers.

   A^2 |     F^1 | 4-. Persons. "And I saw thrones...
                   G^1 | -4. Time. "And they lived again... 1,000 years.
              F^2 | 5-. Persons. "But the rest of the dead...
                   G^2 | -5-. Time. "Until the 1,000 years were finished."
              F^3 | -5, 6-. Persons. "This is the first resurrection.
   Blessed and holy is he," etc.
                   G^3 | -6. Time. "And shall reign with Him 1,000 years."


   F^1. xx. 4-. Persons.

   4-. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
   unto them:]      If this refers to "the souls" mentioned in the second
   pair, then we have certain statements quite out of the natural order.
   Acts and actions are attributed to them before they are said to be
   risen again! Thrones, judges, and sentence are the subjects of this
   first pair; while martyrs, resurrection, and reigning are the subjects
   of the second pair. It seems, therefore, that we have, here, the
   setting-up of the tribunal to judge or vindicate those who shall have
   had part in the "first resurrection;" and to righteously and formally
   give them their position in glory. Dan. vii. is the key to this scene.
   In the 9th verse the word rendered "cast down" means to set or place.
   We see the one throne thus placed, in verse 22; while here (Rev. xx. 4)
   we have the placing of the other thrones, and we see those who will sit
   "upon them." The war of the Beast against the saints is said to prevail
   (Dan. vii. 21, 22) "until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was
   given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints
   possessed the kingdom." The words, "judgment was given them," must be
   compared with Rev. xviii. 20: "God hath judged your judgment upon her
   (Babylon)." So the RV." and the AV. renders this, "God hath avenged you
   on her." The "judgment" here, therefore, means the right or power to
   exercise judgment which at length shall righteously, not only avenge
   the saints on their enemies, but vindicate them and award them their
   position in glory.

   The plural, "they sat," must be taken as including God and Christ, and
   the seven angelic assessors (see Rev. i. 4 and 1 Tim. v. 21, where they
   are thus united, as well as in Matt. xxv. 31). "When the Son of Man
   shall come in his glory and all his holy angels with him, THEN shall he
   sit upon the throne of his glory." That throne is here seen placed for
   judgment immediately before the Millennium, and in connection with the
   "first resurrection." That throne is referred to in Joel iii. 12, Jer.
   iii. 17, Dan. vii. 18, 22. Then will take place, not merely the
   judgment and vindication of the martyred saints of the Tribulation, but
   that of the living nations (or Gentiles), as described in the above
   Scriptures.

   That throne, as well as the thrones of the twelve apostles, are seen
   here placed for judgment according to Matt. xix. 28. Luke xxii. 30.
   Compare Ps. cxxii. 5. Ezek. xliii. 7. Zech. vi. 13. Isa. xxxi. 8, 9.
   xxxii. 1-4.

   Christ will have come, not only to "make war," but to "judge"; for, "in
   righteousness He doth judge and make war" (xix. 11). If this be not the
   judgment of saints and living nations, then there is no place for it at
   all; for the only other judgment mentioned is that of the great white
   throne after the Millennium, at the end of this chapter. Of these final
   five judgments, one is that of living nations before the Millennium,
   and is connected with the first resurrection; while the other is after
   the Millennium, and is connected with the second resurrection.

   The thrones are seen here placed. A tribunal is set up, and power and
   authority to execute judgment, and pronounce the sentence of
   vindication, and award "is given." Upon whom? That question is now to
   be answered. The words, "the souls," &c., are in the accusative case,
   and the AV. and RV. supply in italics, "I saw." But the Ellipsis is
   arbitrarily supplied. After the giving of authority to exercise
   judgment, the natural sequence of thought would be the exercise of it!
   So we supply

   -4-. and [they judged, i.e., vindicated, xviii. 20] those that were
   beheaded (lit., the souls of those who were beheaded, but see below) on
   account of the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God,]

   "The souls of those who were beheaded" are clearly those who had been
   mentioned in chap. vi. 9. They at length enjoy their resurrection and
   receive their vindication there promised to them.

   The expression "souls" in vi. 9 is clearly the antecedent of verse 11,
   where we read "it was given to them." As in chap. vi. 11, so here in
   xx. 4 we must note that the word "them" is masculine, (...) (autois),
   and not feminine, (...) (autais), which is the gender of (...)
   (psuchas), souls. This proves that the expression, which consists of
   four words, "the souls of those who were beheaded," is a Pleonasm, and
   is to be treated as a figure, and not to be translated literally; but,
   being in the masculine gender, should be rendered without
   circumlocution "those who were beheaded" (compare Jer. ii. 34; xlvi.
   15, &c). The promise made to them in chap. vi. 11 is at length seen
   fulfilled in chap. xx. 4.

   But now another statement is made, and it begins with the words (...)
   (kai hoitines), which are rendered "and which" (AV), "and such as"
   (RV), "and those who" (Tregelles), as though the pronoun were in the
   accusative case and depended on the same verb as "souls": i.e., as
   though it read "I saw the souls... and I saw those which," &c. But the
   fact is that this pronoun, (...) (hoitines) is in the nominative case,
   and therefore does not depend on any verb, but is the subject of a new
   sentence altogether, of which the verb is "lived again." This is a
   grammatical fact that scientifically determines the matter for us, and
   prevents us from introducing our own opinions. Of one class of persons,
   viz., the beheaded martyrs, it is said that they were righteously
   judged and vindicated. The next statement of verse 4 goes on to say
   that not only these (who were beheaded), but all, including these who
   refused to worship the Beast, "lived again": i.e., had part in the
   first resurrection, which is presently described.

   -4-. And whosoever [404] did not worship (i.e., had not worshipped) the
   Beast, nor yet his image, and did not receive the (his) mark (xiii. 16)
   on their foreheads, and on their hands, both lived again and reigned
   with Christ]      Here the point is resurrection. They "lived again."
   The verb means to come to life (see Luke xv. 32. John xi. 25. Rom. xiv.
   9. Rev. i. 18; ii. 8). Here we have the fulfilment of that repeated
   statement of the Lord Jesus. "He that findeth his life shall lose it;
   and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matt. x. 39;
   xvi. 25, 26. Mark viii. 35-37. Luke ix. 24; xvii. 33. John xii. 25).

   If these refer to and include all who had lost their lives for faithful
   testimony, then the next clause includes those who had specially done
   so during the Tribulation; for all these "live again," in the first
   resurrection. It is not the extent of the first resurrection which is
   here in question, but a statement concerning some of those who shall
   have part in it. That there are and will be others is implied in verse
   6. All these "both lived again and reigned with Christ."


   G^1. xx. -4. Time.

   -4. A thousand years.]      This is the duration of the millennial
   reign of the Lord Jesus; and this is the throne spoken of in Luke i.
   32, 33: "He shall be great, and the Lord God shall give unto Him the
   throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob
   for ever." This is the throne the Lord refers to in Matt. xxv. 31.
   "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels
   with him, THEN shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." In Rev. xix.
   we have the coming; and in chap. xx. 4, we have the session upon that
   throne.

   Psalm ii. points to the same throne, and Matt. xix. 28 distinctly
   promises to the Twelve Apostles "a kingdom as the Father appointed"
   Him, that they may "eat and drink at his table in his kingdom, and sit
   on thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Israel" (Luke xxii. 29, 30).
   This "judgment" consists of ruling; for "at that time shall they call
   Jerusalem the throne of the Lord, and all nations shall be gathered
   into it" (Jer. iii. 17). This is explained in Matt. xxv. as the judging
   of the "nations." "I saw thrones." Hence there is not only "the throne
   of his glory," but the other thrones on which "they" also (who are
   mentioned in other scriptures) shall sit.

   This is the day when "the Lord shall be king over all the earth" (Zech.
   xiv. 9); when "the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in
   Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously" (Isa. xxiv. 23; ix. 7).
   See also Jer. iii. 17; xxiii. 5. Micah iv. 7. Ezek. xliii. 7.

   Many scriptures tell of the glories of that thousand years. We can only
   sum them up, and that briefly:-- Those years will be characterised by
   (1) the absence of Satan; (2) the restoration of the earth (Ps. lxvii.
   6): many physical marvels, converting its deserts into gardens, and
   causing its wildernesses to blossom as the rose; (3) changes in the
   sun, moon, and stars, which shall affect the climate and fruitfulness
   of the earth; (4) changes in the nature and habits of wild animals; (5)
   righteous government, which is to-day the world's greatest need (Is.
   xxxii. 1; xxix. 18, 19; xxxiii. 6). (6) life prolonged and health
   improved (Is. xxxiii. 24; lxv. 20-23).

   When the thousand years end, their blessedness does not end, but
   increase with the glory of the new heavens and the new earth (Rev.
   xxi., xxii). Men will not cease to live. The nations of the new Earth
   will "consist" and be upheld by the eternal power of the great Creator.


   F^2. xx. 5-. Persons.

   5-. [405] The rest of the dead lived not again]      The verb means to
   live again in the sense of resurrection (see Rom. xiv. 9. Rev. ii. 8).
   These words require not explanation. They are written to explain a
   great and solemn fact to us. "The rest of the dead" include all who
   have no part in the "first resurrection."

   If they "lived not again" until they rise from the dead, in what sense
   can they be said to "live" now while they are dead? The one is the
   antithesis of the other. In like manner, if they are suffering
   punishment in purgatory or elsewhere, in what way does this differ from
   the punishment which is awarded to them when they shall have been
   judged (xx. 14, 15). Another question raised is, In what sense is the
   "second death" different from the first? The questions are easily
   asked; and, if we believe God and His Word instead of tradition or
   theology, they are easily answered. This Scripture is part of a Book
   where future, unseen, and otherwise unknown facts and truths are made
   known to us. Apart from revelation no one knows anything about death
   and judgment. But, thank God, the humblest student of His word, if he
   knows all that God has told us on these subjects, knows all that can be
   known, and is as wise as the wisest of his teachers.

   But, alas, these teachers too often give heed to the teachings of lying
   spirits, through Spiritists and mediums who are themselves deceived;
   and, in consequence, find a difficulty in receiving and believing the
   simple but true revelations of the Word of God.


   G^2. xx. -5-. Time.

   -5-. Until [406] the thousand years should be finished.]      or
   completed: so that their condition, whatever it may be, runs on during
   the whole period of the reign of those who "have part in the first
   resurrection."


   F^3. xx. -5, 6-. Persons.

   -5. This is the first resurrection. (6-) Blessed and holy is he who
   hath part in the first resurrection; over these the second death hath
   not power (or authority), but they shall be (and continue) priests of
   God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him]


   G^3. xx. -6. Time.

   -6. a [407] thousand years.]      "This is the first resurrection"; or,
   this completes the first resurrection. There is an Ellipsis of the verb
   in this sentence; and we may supply completes, having in mind the
   several resurrections which shall before then have taken place. It is
   also a fact that, when two ordinal numbers are used in such a
   connection as this, they are used relatively. The one is first in
   relation to the second, which follows; and not to what may have
   occurred before. In like manner the second stands in relation to the
   first. Hence, in English we always say, in such cases, former and
   latter, where we have only two things thus related; and not first and
   second, unless there are more to follow in the series. It is the same
   in chap. xxi. 1, where we read of the new heavens and the new earth;
   "for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away."

   Here, again, we have two things standing in related contrast, the
   "first" and the "new": i.e., the new, and the one that immediately
   precedes it; the former, and not the "first." For, the present "heavens
   and the earth which are now" (2 Pet. iii. 7) are not the first. For
   Scripture tells us of three, of which the present is the second. In 2
   Pet. iii. 6, 7, 13, we read of the first -- the world that "then was"
   (Gen. i. 1); of the second -- "the heavens and the earth which are
   now"; and of the third -- "a new heavens and a new earth," for which we
   now look. This (second of three) is what is called in Rev. xxi. 1 the
   "first" of the latter two.

   Hence this "first resurrection" is the former of the two mentioned in
   this verse: and not the calling on high of Phil. iii. 14, or the
   resurrection of 1 Thess. iv. 16, 17. This special resurrection (1
   Thess. iv. 16) must be carefully distinguished from that which is
   called the "first resurrection" in Rev. xx. 6. The word "first" in 1
   Thess. iv. 16 does not refer to "the first resurrection" so called in
   Rev. xx. 6, but merely records the order of events, and simply states
   that "the dead in Christ" will "rise first"; i.e., before the taking up
   of either them or the living saints.

   The resurrection of 1 Thess. iv. 16 is not the resurrection of Rev. xx.
   6. It was never revealed in the Old Testament; but was a special
   revelation made "by the word of the Lord" to Paul; and by Paul to the
   Thessalonian saints and to the Church of God.

   The resurrection of Rev. xx. 6 is the well-known "former" of two
   resurrections which had both been long the subject of revelation, and
   was the hope of Israel. The Holy Spirit spoke, by the Psalmist, of the
   righteous dead who should "have dominion" over the rest of the dead "in
   the morning" of this resurrection (Ps. xlix. 14). The Lord spoke of it
   when He called it "the resurrection of the just" (Luke xiv. 14); "the
   resurrection from (among) the dead" (Luke xx. 34-36); "the resurrection
   of life" (John v. 29). Paul spoke of it as "the resurrection of the
   just" (Acts xxiv. 15), for which the twelve tribes hoped, according to
   "the promise made of God unto the fathers" (Acts xxvi. 6-8). In Dan.
   xii. 2 it is spoken of as a resurrection "to everlasting life," in
   which "many" (not all) have part, and "awake."

   Martha expressed her belief in "the resurrection at the last day" (John
   xi. 24); i.e., the last day, at the end of the present age, and
   immediately before the introduction of the new age of the thousand
   years. "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life." By
   this figure of Hendiadys the Lord distinguishes the resurrection for
   which Martha hoped, as the resurrection "to everlasting life." (Dan.
   xii. 2). He refers not to two things, but to one. It is as though He
   had said, "I am the resurrection--, the one that is to eternal life; he
   that believeth on me, though he die, he shall live again; and everyone
   who thus liveth again in resurrection and believeth (again Hendiadys,
   every believer how lives again in resurrection), shall in no wise die
   again for ever" (John xi. 25, 26). No! he shall rise again in the first
   resurrection, and shall by no means die "the second death." That shall
   have no power over such.

   It was for this "first (or former resurrection") that the Old Testament
   Saints looked. It was the "better resurrection" of Heb. xi. 35. It was
   God's revealed promise to them. It was no secret. Its revelation was
   given quite irrespective of the Church of God; and it will take place
   as though the Church had never existed at all.

   But the Church of God, as the Body of Christ, was a "secret." All that
   concerned it was "hid in God": its calling, its standing, its hope, and
   its destiny. All were subjects of special revelation.

   It was "by revelation" that it was made known to the apostle Paul, and
   to us through him (Eph. iii. 3).

   It was by a special and subsequent revelation that we know what God has
   made Christ to be unto His Church; and what He has made the Church to
   be in Christ (Eph. i. 17. Col. ii. 2, 3, etc.).

   It was by special revelation we know that all will not die; that there
   is to be an exception to the Appointment of Heb. ix. 27, "For this we
   say unto you by the word of the Lord." This special prophetic
   revelation was necessary in order to make know the fact that a distinct
   company of believers should be "alive and remain," and not die at all,
   but be caught up to be for ever with the Lord, together with the dead
   in Christ, who shall first (i.e., before this) have been raised (1
   Thess. iv. 15-17). The living saints will not precede or get before
   "the dead in Christ."

   Tradition, as represented in our Hymn-books and on our Tomb-stones,
   reverses all this, and assures us that "the dead in Christ" have
   already preceded or got there before those who are "alive and remain."
   But we believe God; and are assured that the Truth is exactly the
   opposite of Tradition; viz., that those who are "alive and remain"
   shall not precede "the dead in Christ," or be caught up to "be with the
   Lord," before "the dead in Christ" shall have been raised. These shall
   "rise first," and then be caught up, together with the living saints,
   "to be with the Lord."

   To teach otherwise is to fall into the heresy of Hymenaeus and
   Philetus; to "overturn the faith"; and to say that "the resurrection is
   passed already (2 Tim. ii. 17, 18).

   This secret is again mentioned in 1 Cor. xv. 51: "Behold I show you a
   mystery": i.e., "behold I tell you a secret: we shall not all sleep,
   but we shall all be changed."

   The great secret in 1 Tim. iii. 16, to the still greater secret of Eph.
   and Phil. and Col., includes a special "calling on high," and being
   "received up into glory."

   All this is quite independent of "the first resurrection" of Rev. xx.
   6. That was never a secret, but was revealed of old as the hope of
   Israel (Act xxvi. 6, 7).

   The hope of Israel is one thing, and is quite distinct from the hope of
   the Church, which is another thing. The Gentiles are "without hope."
   The Scriptures of truth which treat of "the Jews, the Gentile, and the
   Church of God" must be rightly divided, or we shall not get the truth.
   These resurrections must be divided according to the dispensations to
   which they respectively belong.

   The resurrection in 1 Thess. iv. belongs to this present dispensation
   of grace; while the two in Rev. xx. belong to the time of the end, in
   the future dispensation of judgment.

   We know not how long a time will elapse between the resurrection of
   believers (1 Thess. iv.), and the "first," or former of the two
   resurrections of Rev. xx: but we are told, and therefore know, that
   there will be a thousand years between these latter two.

   1 Cor. xv. treats of the subject of Resurrection. This was the subject
   in dispute, and this is the scope of the chapter. It is the "gospel"
   (verse 1), not the "mystery." It is the "Kingdom" (verse 24), and not
   the Church of God. It is the fulfilment of the Old Testament promise of
   Isa. xxv. 8, and not the revelation of the Rapture of 1 Thess. iv. It
   is "them" and "they" (verses 20, 23, 29); and not "we." The moment it
   comes to "we" in verse 49, he proceeds, briefly, in a few words, to
   speak of the "mystery" in verses 51, 52 [408] , but immediately
   returns, in verse 53 to the end, to speak of THE Resurrection. It is
   "the second man" (verse 47), "the last Adam" (verse 45), not the "Head"
   of the Body. It is the "firstfruits" in connection with the Harvest
   (Rev. xiv. 4); and not the "Head" in relation to the members. It is
   "all " in connection with mankind (verse 22), and not the elect members
   of the Body of Christ. It is of various "ranks," not of "one Body."

   The ranks or corps [409] of the different bodies referred to shut out
   the thought of the "one body." The Church is a corps by itself, which
   will be caught away long before the "first resurrection." Christ is not
   the "firstfruits" of the Body, but its "Head." The first (...) (tagma)
   is Christ (Personal and Mystical). The Second Tagma is the first
   Resurrection at His Apocalypse or Revelation in glory. The Third Tagma
   is the last corps ((...), to telos) at the end of the Millennium. The
   church will, necessarily, have risen before these, so as to be able to
   "appear with Him in glory." When His Apocalypse or Revelation takes
   place, He will already have come for His Church and have been
   "glorified in His saints" (2 Thess. i. 10 [410] ). This really settles
   the whole question, and proves that the resurrection and ascension of
   the Church in 1 Thess. iv. are quite distinct in time, and order, and
   character, from the "first" resurrection of Rev. xx.

   The latter is the subject we have before us now, and the first
   resurrection has special reference to the overcomers, according to the
   promise made to them in chap. ii. 11: "he that overcometh shall not be
   hurt of the second death." In contrast with this is set the fact that
   they shall be priests of God and of Christ." This also is the
   realization of what is stated in chap. i. 6 and chap. v. 10, where the
   Zoa and the Elders say of those who were redeemed, Thou "hast made them
   kings and priests: and they shall reign on the earth." This is what was
   prophesied in Is. lxi. 6: "Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord,
   and men shall call you the Ministers of our God" (compare Ex. xix. 6).

   It is again affirmed that those who have part in the "first
   resurrection" will have this blessedness for the thousand years. During
   that time they live and reign with Christ. How "principles" can do this
   (as some teach) we are at a loss to understand! How the "memory" and
   the "character" of the saints can reign over the Gentiles is a still
   greater mystery, and we must leave the difficulty with those who create
   it, and "give it up." Man may say they reign "as if they were martyrs
   raised from the dead." The Word says that they will be actually raised,
   and will actually reign. They do not "live again" "spiritually," or "in
   their successors." Those who were beheaded are the same as those who
   reign; and how "principles" or "character" can be beheaded we have yet
   to learn.


   THE FOURTH JUDGMENT

   We come now to the fourth of these final five judgments. The third--
   central one-- differs (as we have seen) in character from the others.
   It is a judgment which vindicates and rewards those who are the
   subjects of it. The others are all for condemnation and judgment.

   B^2. xx. 7-10. The Judgment of Satan. (After the Millennium).

   B^2 |     H | 7. Satan "loosed out of his prison."
                   J | 8. The Nations deceived.
                   J | 9. The Nations devoured.
             H | 10. Satan "cast into the lake of fire."


   H. xx. 7. Satan loosed out of his prison.

   7. And when the thousand years are completed, Satan shall be loosed out
   of his prison,]      In verse 3 it was stated that "he should deceive
   the nations no more until the thousand years should be finished; after
   this he MUST be loosed a little season." Here, in verse 7, we have the
   fact, the necessity of which is there declared.

   But why "MUST" Satan be loosed, even for "a little season"? Wherein
   lies the reason for this mysterious necessity?

   To understand the word "must" of verse 3, we shall have to discover
   something of the Divine purposes and counsels in ruling and overruling
   the course of this world. "Known unto God are all His works from the
   beginning of the world" (Acts xv. 18).

   "The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying,
   Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass;
   And as I have purposed, so shall it stand" (Isa. xiv. 24).

   At the beginning there was Satan's first rebellion; and now, at the
   end, we have this final rebellion. In Gen. i. 1, we have the primal
   creation of the heavens and the earth, in perfect order and beauty. In
   verse 2 we are told that they became a ruin--, waste, and desolate.
   How, or why, or when, they thus became we are not told. We believe that
   it was on account of Satan's first rebellion. That he did rebel, we
   know. And we know also that it was through pride (1 Tim. iii. 6, 7). It
   must have happened at that time, between the first and second verses of
   Gen. i, for in Gen. iii. he is introduced as a fallen angel, the enemy
   of God and man.

   We know, also that God did not originally create the world as it is
   described in Gen. i. 2. It is there described as (...) (tohu) (...)
   (vabohu) i.e., empty, waste, and desolate [411] . Now, it does not
   matter what (...) (tohu) means, because it is expressly declared by the
   Creator in Isa. xlv. 18, that he did not create it tohu. And the
   expressions describing the Divine Creator are heaped together to
   impress us with the fact that He who made it ought to know. He says:--

   "Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens:
   God himself that formed the earth and made it:
   He hath established it,
   HE CREATED IT NOT TOHU."

   Therefore it must have become so at some time, and in some manner, and
   for some reason, which are not revealed. This is the very meaning of
   the Hebrew verb (...) (hayah) to come to be. [412] "And (or but) the
   earth BECAME wasteness and emptiness."

   We submit that this catastrophe was brought about by the first
   rebellion of Satan. [413] Of no other than Satan could it be said at
   that time that he was the author of evil, and of "the lie."

   If this be so, then we are able to see the order of all the various
   dispensations; and learn how all the evil is to be overcome; how the
   new heavens and the new earth are to be brought about; and how the
   curse is to be removed.

   The following Structure of the Divine Plan of the Ages sets forth the
   correspondence between the steps of the Ruin and the Restoration; and
   shows that the Restoration is to be brought about in an inverse order
   to that of the Ruin. The eight steps roll back upon themselves, until
   the Primal blessedness is at length seen restored. In this Structure,
   which is seen to be an Introversion, the first member (A) corresponds
   with the last (A); the second (B) with the next to the last (B); and so
   throughout: that is to say, the Primal Creation (A) is placed in
   contrast with the New Heavens and the New Earth (A). Satan's first
   rebellion (B) stands in connection with his final rebellion (B). The
   Restored Earth of Gen. i. ii. (C) stands in correspondence with the
   Millennial Earth (C). Satan loose in Gen. iii. (D) is put in contrast
   with Satan bound in Rev. xx. 1-3 (D). The dealing with mankind as a
   whole in Gen. iv.-- (E) is set in correspondence with similar dealing
   foretold in prophecy (E). The Calling of Israel in Gen. xi. (F) is
   placed in contrast with their Re-calling and promised blessing (F). The
   first Advent (G) is seen to stand in contrast with the second Advent
   (G), and to be quite a separate and distinct event from the "Calling on
   high of Phil. iii. 14, or the Parousia of 1 Thess. iv. The second
   Advent was the subject of Old Testament prophecy, but the Pre-taking up
   of the Church was a special revelation given to Paul "by the Word of
   the Lord" in 1 Thess. iv. 13-- 11.

        The "Third Heaven" and "Paradise," 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4.  Compare 2
   Pet. iii. 6, 7, and 13.)


   A careful study of this Structure will show that the several
   dispensations which form the great subject of the Word of God could not
   be otherwise divided. Jew, Gentile, and the Church of God are
   distinguished; and each has its own proper place. The two Advents are
   separated, and the second is distinguished from the Parousia and the
   "blessed hope" which are quite distinct and separate events. The Church
   occupies the central position; and its present standing is separated
   from its future destiny and hope. The two rebellions of Satan are also
   seen to be in direct correspondence, so that now we can see the
   necessity for this "must be" of verse 3; and for this loosing in Rev.
   xx. 7-10.

   But there is a deeper reason than that which appears on the surface of
   this Structure of the Divine Plan of the Ages.

   All the counsels and purposes of God have Christ for their centre,
   their subject, and their object. Not only "by him were all things
   created" (Col. i. 16, &c.), but "by him all things consist" (Col. i.
   17).

   From this it follows that no created being, heavenly or earthly, can
   stand ("upright") or "consist," apart from Him. He is "upholding all
   things by the word of His power" (Heb. i. 3).

   In Eph. iii. 10 we are told that God is using the Mystery, i.e., the
   Church, as an object-lesson; and through (RV, i.e., by means of) it He
   is making known, NOW, unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
   places, something of His manifold wisdom.

   What is the lesson that God is now teaching these heavenly beings?

   It is simply this:-- that no created being can stand apart from Christ
   the Creator. It is this that is brought out by the Structure of the
   Dispensations.

   B. Satan could not stand, though blessed with untold powers and
   dignities.

   D. Man could not stand, though placed in the most favorable
   circumstances.

   E. The Nations could not stand. They soon rebelled against God's
   commands; and set up Babel as the monument of their defiance.

   F. The chosen nation (Israel) could not stand, though placed in a
   position as favourable (nationally) as man had been in Adam
   (individually). The nations having all failed: then, a new nation, a
   chosen nation, is formed out of one man, Abraham; and placed in a
   country which was as another Garden of the Lord; and blessed with
   national blessings such as no nation ever enjoyed before or since. But
   Israel failed, and instead of being a blessing became a curse. They
   forsook the Covenant of the Lord; despised His Law; threw down His
   altars, and slew His prophets with the sword (1 Kings xix. 10). Then
   came

   G. The First Advent. "Having yet one Son, his well-beloved, he sent him
   also last unto them." But those wicked husbandmen "took him and slew
   him, and cast him out" (Mark xii. 6-8). Those husbandmen were
   "miserably destroyed." Their city was razed to the ground, their temple
   burnt, and their people scattered to the four winds of heaven. The
   Gospels and Acts set forth the terrible story. And now

   H. After the rejection of the King and the Kingdom (Acts iii. 19, 20
   (RV), compared with xxviii. 25, 26). We have in

   H. The Kingdom in Abeyance? NOT YET "do we see all thing put under His
   feet" (Heb. ii. 8); but we have "the mystery of Christ and His Church"
   revealed (Eph. v. 32), and not until this has been "received up in
   glory" (1 Tim. iii. 16) will the time have come for Christ to sit upon
   His own throne.

   It is not God's counsel to use the Church as the means by which He will
   bring in the New Heavens and the New Earth. That new creation will be
   full of physical marvels, which cannot be brought about by spiritual
   agencies. Cause must have come relation to effect. And God has
   appointed other means to remove the curse from the earth, and make an
   end of sin and of death. Physical means will be used to bring about
   physical changes and bring in physical blessings.

   The Church is now waiting-- for the world's conversion, because it
   knows that its apostasy is foretold (2 Thess. ii. 3). The Pauline
   Epistles tell of the Church's calling, and standing, and object, and
   hope. The members of the Church of God WILL STAND and stand for ever;
   because they are "in Christ," and are the members of that Body of which
   He is that glorious Head in heaven, and they the members of that Body
   on earth. In Him they will know "no condemnation." From Him there will
   be no separation (Rom. viii. 1, 39). They will stand, for their
   standing is Christ's own standing. They stand for ever in Him. [414]

   F. And Israel. What of Israel? Will Israel stand? Yes, for Jehovah has
   said:

   "I will take you from among the heathen,
   And gather you out of all countries.
   And will bring you into your own land,
   THEN will I sprinkle clean water upon you
   And ye shall be clean;
   From all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
   A new heart also will I give you,
   And a new spirit will I put within you;
   And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
   And I will give you a heart of flesh,
   And I will put my Spirit within you,
   And cause you to walk in my statutes;
   And ye shall keep my judgments and do them,
   And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers,
   And ye shall be my People, and I will be your God...
   I, the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it" (Ezek. xxxvi. 24-28, 36).

   Then shall be seen the only indefectible nation the world has ever
   known. Israel shall "no more go astray" (Ez. xiv. 11). "Thy people
   shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever" (Isa. lx.
   21). Their sins and their iniquities will be remembered no more (Jer.
   xxxi. 33, 34. Zech. xiii. 2. Isa. xliii. 25). "I will no more make you
   a reproach" (Joel ii. 19). "Neither will I hide my face any more from
   them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith
   Adonai Jehovah" (Ezek. xxxix. 29).

   Yes, Israel WILL STAND then, because, and only because, Israel shall be
   holden up by the infinite power of Jehovah-- Almighty Creator and
   Covenant God.

   E. And the Nations. What of them? They will have beheld and enjoyed for
   a thousand years the goodness of Jehovah. The knowledge of His glory
   shall have flooded the earth. All shall be taught of God. For a
   thousand years they shall have known a righteous and holy government,
   and enjoyed peace, prosperity and plenty. What of this? Will these
   things give a new heart? Will they be able to undo the enmity of the
   natural heart to God? (Rom. viii. 7. Jas. iv. 4). No! "The carnal mind
   is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither
   indeed can be." "That which is born of the flesh, is flesh," and
   remains flesh. And only "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,"
   and remains spirit (John iii. 6). The only safety for any Gentile will
   be Ex. xii. 48.

   The Nations did not stand in the midst of all the corruptions with
   which they corrupted their way in Gen. iv-- Neither will they stand in
   spite of all the manifestation of God's glory in the earth. Even in the
   midst of Millennial glory many will render only a feigned obedience
   (Ps. lxvi. 3; cxliv. 7, 11).

   Zech. xiv. 16-19 reveals a disinclination on the part of some of the
   nations to make the long annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem; and Messiah's
   rule is with "a rod of iron" and "in the midst among enemies" (Px. cx.
   2).

   When Satan shall be loosed they are at once, and apparently, easily
   "deceived" and ready to believe his lies, and to manifest the enmity of
   the natural heart by fighting under him against God.

   To bring out this awful fact, and exhibit the true nature of man; and
   to manifest the grace of God; and to show that, apart from Christ,
   nothing can exist, or consist, or stand, Satan "MUST be loosed for a
   little season." The great lesson of the ages will not be fully
   manifested or seen till then; but even now it is being taught to
   angelic beings in heaven. The great object lesson can even now, but not
   till now, be taught them "by means of the church."

   Now, saved sinners and rebels can be pointed to as "in Christ," and
   therefore for ever saved, safe, and secure. And all this is "according
   to the eternal purpose ("the purpose of the ages," RV. marg.) which He
   purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Eph. iii. 11).

   Now we see why Satan "must be loosed." Now we learn the secret of this
   mysterious necessity. It must be shown that time does not alter Satan's
   character; and that the goodness of God has no more effect upon the old
   nature than the judgments of God.


   J. xx. 8. The Nations deceived.

   8. And will go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four corners
   of the earth, God and Magog, to gather them together to the (predicted)
   war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.]      How, and with
   what lies, he will deceive them we are not told. But we are not without
   examples of how easily nations may be deceived by man, even in our own
   day. And Satan will find means to discredit God's dealings and
   misrepresent His words. As He deceived the angels, who, in consequence,
   "sinned," and shared his fall; and lied to our first parents in the
   garden (Gen. iii.); and made the nations rebel (Gen. xi.), so again
   will he succeed in his final rebellion. It is idle to give reins to our
   imagination. For us the solemn fact must be sufficient.

   "Gog and Magog" denote the nations as a whole. Magog is mentioned as
   the first son of Japhet in Gen. x. 2. With him are associated his
   brethren, Gomer (Kimmerians), Madai (Medians), Meshech (Muscovites),
   etc. In Ezek. xxxviii. 5, are added Persians, and Ethiopians, and
   Libyans. Josephus renders the word Magog, Scythians (Ant. i. 6, 3). The
   two words combine the nations North and East of Palestine.

   Ezek. xxxviii. and xxxix. must be distinguished from Rev. xx. Ezekiel
   records the war referred to in Rev. xvi. 14; xvii. 14; xix. 17-21,
   which takes place before the Millennium; while Rev. xx. takes place
   after it. This is clear from the fact that Israel's restoration is
   mentioned after the destruction of Gog and Magog. See Ezek. xxxix. 25,
   "NOW will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the
   whole house of Israel." This is conclusive, and should clear up many
   doubts on this vexed question.

   The word "Magog" is found only in Gen. x. 2 as a son of Japhet; in
   Ezekiel, where it means a land or country, of which Gog is the prince;
   and in Rev. xx. 8, where "Gog and Magog" appears to be an inclusive
   term for the Gentile nations.

   It is absurd to talk about "John borrowing from Ezekiel," as so many
   say. There is no "borrowing" in the matter. Both prophecies are "given
   by inspiration of God," and refer to two distinct subjects. There is no
   confusion between them if we rightly divide the times to which they
   respectively belong.


   J. xx. 9. The Nations Devoured.

   9. And they went up upon the breadth of the Land, and encompassed the
   citadel of the saints, and the beloved city: and there came down fire
   out of heaven, [415] and devoured them.]      That the Land is meant
   here, and not the earth, seems clear from Isa. viii. 8, where we have
   the same expression. (So Hab. i. 6) It denotes the whole extent of the
   Land.

   There are no contending armies here. The issue of this invasion of the
   Land is speedily and finally terminated by a special Divine judgment.
   Fire comes down from Heaven and devours the mighty host. A special
   judgment is reserved for Satan.


   H. xx. 10. Satan Cast into the Lake of Fire.

   10. And the Devil that deceived them was cast into a lake of fire and
   brimstone, where both [416] the Beast and the False Prophet are, and
   they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever]      Not now
   is Satan merely to be "bound." At length he receives his final doom.

   This is reason of Satan's hatred of this book of the Revelation. It is
   the book which tells of his doom; as Genesis foretells it (Gen. iii.
   15). That lake of fire was prepared for him and his angels (Matt. xxv.
   41). His dupes are devoured by fire from above; he is to be tormented
   by fire from beneath.


   THE FIFTH JUDGMENT

   We now come to the last of these final five judgment scenes-- of the
   Great White Throne. This is not a "general judgment." That fact that
   there are five judgments recorded in this last Vision on Earth shows,
   not only that the expression "general" is foreign to Scripture, but
   that such a judgment is unknown. As to the Church, if it can be called
   a "judgment" at all, the Church has already passed through hers as to
   service and works (not as to standing, of course), according to 2 Cor.
   v. 10, and Rom. xiv. 10, where wrong service will be "made manifest,"
   and rewards will be "received" at the Bema of Christ. The third of
   these five judgments is that of the Overcomers, who, like the Church,
   will be vindicated and rewarded.

   This judgment is generally supposed to be identical with that of Matt.
   xxv.: notwithstanding that the latter is not at all "general," but is
   confined to "living nations," and not one word is said of resurrection.
   Here, though only "the rest of the dead" are concerned, and there is
   not a word as to any except those who are raised from the dead, it is
   still taken to be "general," in spite of 1 Cor. xv., which speaks of
   the "order" of the resurrections; and Rev. xx. 4, 5, which speaks of
   two others.

   This is sufficient to show the confusion which must necessarily ensue
   if we are not careful in "rightly dividing the Word of truth."

   The passage (xx. 11-15) which records this last of the five judgments
   is seen, by the Structure, to consist of four pairs, as follows:

   A^3. xx. 11-15. The Judgment of the Great White Throne.

   A^3 |    K^1 |    c^1 | 11-. The great white throne. "And I saw...
                               d^1 | -11. The Judge who sat thereon
             K^2 |    c^2 | 12-. The raised dead (from earth). "And I
   saw....
                               d^2 | -12. Their judgment.
             K^3 |    c^3 | 13-. The raised dead (from the sea).
                               d^3 | -13. Their judgment.
             K^4 |    c4 | 14. Death and the grave.
                               d^4 | 15. Their final judgment.


   First we have the Throne itself:

   c^1. xx. 11-. The Great White Throne.

   11-. And I saw a great white throne,]      "great," is distinction from
   the other thrones mentioned in this book, and that of chap. iv. 2-6.
   That was set "in heaven." This is seen in the last Vision "on earth";
   as were also the throne in the fourth verse. It is not only "great," to
   indicate the greatness of the occasion, and of its power and authority:
   but "white," to indicate its purity, holiness, and righteousness. There
   are no threatenings here. No thunderings and lightnings: no voices.
   Nothing "around" it: nothing "before" it. Only


   d^1. xx. -11. The Judge who sat thereon.

   -11. And him that sat thereon, from whose face the earth and the heaven
   fled away; and no place was found for them.]      No name is given. No
   form is described. Only an awful, mysterious presence. This is perhaps
   the moment of 2 Peter iii. 10-12. It is the "day of God," as distinct
   from "the day of Christ" (Phil. i. 6; ii. 16); and from "the day of the
   Lord."

   It needs no human description nor interpretation. Heretics might say in
   Paul's day that "the resurrection is passed already" (2 Tim. ii. 18).
   Swedenborg may tell his followers that this judgment scene took place
   in 1757, and that he saw it with is own eyes [417] . We sweep aside all
   human assertions and opinions, and listen to the solemn and weighty
   words which tell us of the solemnity of this last judgment scene.


   c^2. xx. 12-. The Raised Dead (from the earth).

   12-. And I saw the dead, the great and small, standing before the
   throne; [418] and books were opened; and another book was opened, which
   is the book of life:]      "The dead" are "the rest of the dead," who
   "lived not again" (i.e., were not raised) till the thousand years were
   completed, as stated in verse 5.

   This judgment is different from all the others. It differs from the
   first (xix. 11), in that that was a judicial act of summary
   retribution. And it differs from the others in that it is a deliberate
   session; a formal process of judgment deciding according to the
   evidence produced.

   Nothing is said as to the contents of these books. In iii. 5; xiii. 8;
   xvii. 8; xx. 12, 15; xxi. 27 we read that "the book of life" contains
   "names," and probably names also fill these "books." In the Old
   Testament also, it is mentioned (Ex. xxxii. 32. Ps. lxix. 28).

   We need not speculate as to what is written in these books. Nor can we
   tell whether this other book-- book of life-- mentioned negatively, to
   exclude those not named in it; or positively, to embrace those who are.
   What we do know is that "the first resurrection" is specifically called
   "the resurrection of life"; and that those who have part in it will not
   be reckoned with "the rest of the dead which lived not again till the
   thousand years were finished." The words, "according to their works"
   looks as though there may be two classes of these "dead." But where the
   Word is silent, it is better for us to be silent also.


   d^2. xx. -12. Their Judgment.

   -12. And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books,
   according to their works.]      These books, as Alford says, seem "the
   vouchers for the Book of Life." If so, they contain the evidence to
   show cause why the names are not written therein. There is no account
   of any name being found in the Book of Life. One thing, however, is
   clear, and that is, that the church of God cannot be here; for the
   standing of its members is not of works at all; but is wholly of grace.


   c^3. xx. 13-. The Raised Dead (from the Sea).

   13-. And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and Death and the
   Grave (Hades, i. 18; vi. 8) gave up the dead that were in them:]
   It is a question there of resurrection; and the language used is meant
   to include the unburied as well as the buried. There is nothing said
   about "souls," but only of persons raised from the dead.


   d^3. xx. -13. Their Judgment.

   -13. And they were judged, each one, according to their works.]
   The Sinaitic MS. reads condemned instead of judged, but the latter word
   implies the former, if that is "the resurrection of condemnation"
   spoken of in other scriptures.


   c^4. xx. 14. Death and the Grave.

   14. And Death and the Grave were cast into the lake of fire. This is
   the second death, even the lake of fire. [419] (15) And whosoever was
   not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of
   fire.]      The reference to the Book of Life in this connection seems
   to imply one of two things. (1) Either it is opened for condemnation,
   the name not being there; or (2) it implies that the names have been
   "blotted out" (iii. 5).

   In either case "the rest of the dead" would not include the Church, or
   Israel, or the Elect Remnant, nor the names of those who make up the
   superhuman wild Beasts of Rev. xiii. and xvii.

   No one can say which of these two views is correct. Nor can it be
   necessary for us to know.

   Thus ends the description of these five judgments which conclude the
   last Vision of things "on earth;" and which have to do with the earth
   "which now is."

   The structure of this Seventh (and last) Vision "on Earth" has been
   given and its members expanded, showing the five final judgments, as to
   their order.

   But there is a further inter-relation between these five, if we look at
   them as a whole; and have regard to the events themselves, rather than
   their connection with "Men" and "Satan." The first and second judgments
   form one member, thus making four members in all, arranged as a simple
   alternation:--

   The Seventh Vision "on Earth."

   A^1 |    C |    a | xix. 17-19.  War.  Before the Millennium.
   &                        b | 20, 21.  The lake of fire.  Beast cast
   into it.
   B^1                                 D |    c | xx. 1-3.  Satan bound.
   ^                                                      d | -3.  Nations
   not deceived for 1000 years.
                                                               A^2 |    e
   | 4.  Thrones.

       f | 5-.  Rest of dead.

           g | -5.  First resurrection.

                h | 6.  Its privileges.
   B^2 |                              D |    c | xx. 7.  Satan loosed.
                                                        d | 8.  Nations
   deceived.
              C |    a | 9.  War.  After the Millennium.
                               b | 10.  The lake of fire.  Satan cast into
   it.
                                                               A^3 |    e
   | 11.  Great White Throne.

       f | 12-14.  Rest of dead.

           g | -14.  Second death.

                h | 15.  Its subjects.

     ^

   Thus we see one beautiful structure contained within the other; both
   perfect; showing how intimately these five members are related, and
   revealing a further hidden correspondence between them.

   The next Vision introduces us to the eternal state of the New Heavens
   and the New Earth, and those who shall dwell therein.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [400] G.L.T.Tr. WH. and RV. read (...) (sunachthete) be gathered
   together, instead of (...) (sunagesthe) and gather yourselves together.

   [401] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (to mega tou), the great
   supper of, instead of (...) (tou magalou) of the great.

   [402] We say "subsequent" to this, for (1) it comes on a Land and
   people brought back (Ezek. xxxviii. 8). (2) It finds them dwelling
   safely. (3) They dwell in unwalled Towns (verse 11). (4) They have been
   gathered out, and have got cattle and goods (verse 12). (5) God calls
   it "My Land" (verse 16). (6) They get no nearer than "the Mountains of
   Israel" (xxxix. 4). (7) It will take seven months to destroy their
   debris (verse 12).

   [403] 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19 becomes quite clear when we remember (1) that
   men are never called "spirits," and (2) that "He maketh His angels
   spirits." (3) That these "disobedient" spirits in verse 20 are
   contrasted with obedient "angels... made subject unto Him" in verse 22.
   (4) That in 2 Pet. ii. 4 we read of the "angels that sinned being cast
   down to Tartarus, and delivered ... unto chains of darkness to be
   reserved unto judgment." (5) That in Jude 6 we read of the "angels
   which kept not their first estate," being "reserved in everlasting
   chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
       With all these Scriptures about Angels being bound with chains,
   etc., it is strange, indeed, that, in spite of the words "in prison," 1
   Pet. iii. 19, "spirits" should be interpreted of dead men, instead of
   fallen angels.

   [404] For so (...) (hoitines) is rendered in Matt. v. 39, 41; vii. 24;
   x. 32, 33; xiii. 12; xviii. 4; xxiii. 12. Mark viii. 34. Luke xiv. 27.
   Gal. v. 4. Jas. ii. 10.

   [405] L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit "but."

   [406] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (ezesan achri), instead of
   (...) (anezesan heos).

   [407] T.Tr.A^b. WH^b. and RVm. read "the."

   [408] All shall not sleep (or, die) but all shall be changed. The
   thought in verses 51, 52 is parenthetical.

   [409] The word (...) (tagma) means a body, or troop or corps of
   soldiers. See 2 Sam. xxiii. 13. Xen. Mem., 3, 1, 11. Often in Polybius.
   Diod. Sic. 27, 18. Josephus, Wars, 1, 9, 1; 3, 4, 2.

   [410] See The Church Epistles, by the same author and publisher, pages
   241-243.

   [411] The expression occurs in Isa. xxiv. 10; xxiv. 11, and Jer. iv.
   23.

   [412] See Gen. ii. 7, "Man became a living soul"; xix. 26, "She became
   a pillar of salt"; xxiv. 60, "Be thou (i.e., become thou) the mother of
   thousands of millions." Ex. xix. 15, "Be ready (i.e., become or get
   ready) against the third day." Isa. i. 9, "We should have been (i.e.,
   become) as Sodom." Jer. xlviii. 6, "Be (i.e., become) like the heath in
   the wilderness."

   [413] In reference to Satan's first interference with the earth, see
   Matt. xiii. 24. "His field" seems to disprove the notion of some that
   this earth was once apportioned to Satan (especially in connection with
   Job xxxviii. 4). Was it not Satan who caused the waters to gush out of
   the earth and drown it-- as when a man stabs another, and leaves him
   weltering in his blood (Ps. vii. 15). Job xxxviii. 8 suggests the
   thought that the earth had been violated, and the Lord acted the part
   of a healer (verses 9-12). Yet, as if the world were not perfectly
   healed, the seas are witnesses of the violence done to the earth. But
   perhaps Ez. xxviii., especially verse 15, takes us to the origin of his
   sin. Satan never would acknowledge the authority of law; would never
   acknowledge authority. All who are of him, say, "Our mouths are our
   own." "Who is Lord over us?" expresses his conduct as well as man's.

   [414] This, of course, refers to individual standing here. Not to
   corporate standing. That has totally failed, as the Epistles testify.
   Corporate standing, now, is only "IN CHRIST," which includes all the
   members of His Body.

   [415] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit "from God."

   [416] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. add (...) (kai) both.

                          The People of the New Earth

   B. Chaps. xxi. 1-- 5.


   This member corresponds with the member B (chaps. ii. and iii.). Those
   chapters are occupied specially with the people who will be on the
   earth during the Day of the Lord and in the Great Tribulation--
   concluding days of the old earth. These chaps. xxi. 1-- 5, are occupied
   with the New Earth and the people who shall dwell therein, after all
   those judgments are ended.

   This large member is divided into three parts:--

   B., xxi. 1-- 5.  The People of the New Earth.

   B |    A | xxi. 1, 2.  Visions:  (Heavens and Earth, etc.).
                   B | 3-8.  Voices.
           A | xxi. 9-- 5.  Visions: (the Bride).

   These again may be divided up and expanded.  We will give each, in
   order:--

   A., xxi. 1, 2.  Visions.

   A |    a |    b | xxi. 1-.  Vision.  "And I saw."
                           c | -1.  The New Heavens and New Earth.
            a |    b | 2-.  Vision.  "And I saw."
                           c | -2.  The New Jerusalem.

   In this former Vision (A) two things are seen. (1) The New Heavens and
   Earth, and (2) the New Jerusalem.

   In the latter Vision (A. xxi. 9-- 5), we have the second Vision
   enlarged, extended, and more fully described. The two series of Visions
   are separated by the voices (B. xxi. 3-8).

   Apart from what God is pleased to show us, and tell us, nothing could
   possibly be known by mortal man.

   All imaginations, therefore, are worse than useless; they are
   misleading. Hence the importance of these significant expressions "And
   I saw," "And I heard," "And I saw."

   The whole of this member (xxi. 1-- 5) must be taken as coming after the
   judgment of the Great White Throne.

   Some have looked on these two chapters as merely containing further
   details concerning the Millennium. But the fact of the New Heavens and
   the New Earth; and the passing away of the former heavens and earth;
   and of there being "no more sea," quite precludes the possibility of
   this being a mere recurrence to former things, and the filling in of
   further details.

   This will be seen as we proceed.


   a. xxi. 1. The New Heavens and Earth.

   xxi. 1. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the former heaven
   and the former earth were passed away, and there was no more sea.]
   Here again we have the same remarks to make as were made with reference
   to the "first" and "second" resurrections. It is the former earth that
   had passed away, to give place to that which is not called the second
   but the "new." As we there said, the first heaven and earth "which then
   was" (i.e., Gen. i. 1) "perished" (2 Pet. iii. 6), or passed away. The
   second heavens and earth "which are now," are kept in store, reserved
   unto fire (2 Pet. iii. 7). That fire is the means by which they shall
   "pass away" (2 Pet. iii. 10), and the New Heavens and the New Earth
   come into being. Both these passages are in agreement with Is. li. 6,
   16; and lxv. 17.

   Tradition talks about "the end of the world"; and consequently errs,
   "not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God." There will be an end
   of this age, but not of the world, as man thinks and speaks. There are
   other scriptures which speak of this passing away (see Matt. v. 18;
   xxiv. 34, 25. Mark xiii. 30, 31. Luke xvi. 17; xxi. 33).

   All will be "new." The word rendered "new" ((...), kainos) means new,
   not merely as to time, but as to kind and as to quality.

   The heaven will be "new"; the earth "new"; for there will be "no more
   curse," and therefore no more sin, or suffering, or sorrow.

   Among these new things will be


   a. xxi. 2. The Holy City.

   xxi. 2. And I [420] saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out
   of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.]
   The name of the city is given in its Hebrew form; not the Grecised
   name; as though to mark it off from the earthly city. But it is none
   the less literal. The Heavens are literal. The Earth is literal. The
   Sea is literal. Why is not the City to be literal? New, of course, it
   will be. New in its materials, size, shape, location, origin, and
   everything connected with or relating to it. This city is further
   described in the later vision, which is deferred so that we may hear
   the heavenly voices which describe it and its object.

   B. xxi. 3-8. Voices.

   removed, verse 8.


   d. (above), xxi. 3. The Loud Voice, and Things Uttered.

   xxi. 3. And I heard a loud voice out of the throne [421] saying,
   Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell (or
   tabernacle) with them, and they shall be His People, and God Himself
   shall be with them, [422] and be their God.]      No longer is this
   blessing to be confined to Israel. All men on the new earth (for these
   are the subjects of this section, B) are the recipients of this
   wondrous blessing. Even with Israel, this blessing was conditional
   (Lev. xxvi. 3, 11, 112. 1 Kings vi. 11-13; ix. 3-9). In the Millennium
   it will be unconditional (Ezek. xxi. 42-46; xxxvii. 23, 24, 26-28. Ps.
   cxxxv. 21; lxviii. 16, 18. Zech. ii. 10; viii. 3, &c.), but even then
   only of Israel. Here it is universal of all earth's inhabitants. At
   length, as before the Fall, God dwells with men. These "men" are spoken
   of as "the nations" (ch. xxi. 24-26).

   The blessed condition of the inhabitants of the New Earth is next
   further described.

   4. And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall
   be no more, neither sorrow nor mourning, nor crying; neither shall
   there be any more pain: because the former things are passed
   away.]      Every tear, for there are many tears, and many causes for
   them. Death no longer, no more dying beds, funerals, or graves. Sorrow
   ceases. Mourning is at an end: and crying shall be hushed and pain
   unfelt (Isa. xxv. 7, 8; xxxv. 10. Jer. xxxi. 16).

   We have further voices in the next verses, 5-8.


   d. xxi. 5-8. He that sat on the Throne, and Things Uttered.

   xxi. 5. And He that sitteth upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all
   Things new." And He saith, [423]

    "Write: because these words are faithful and true."

   (6) And He said to me,

   "They [424] are accomplished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
   beginning and the end. I will give unto him that thirsteth of the
   fountain of the water of life, freely. (7) He that overcometh shall
   inherit these things [425] ; and I will be his God, and he shall be my
   son. (8) But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and
   murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolators, and all
   liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
   brimstone: which is the second death."]

   These are the words from the Throne. The command to write these things
   implies that the others had already been written.

   Three times we have the expression "and He said":

   (1). All is to be made new;
   (2). All is faithful and true; and
   (3). All is accomplished which had been foretold and decreed.

   John sees first the New Earth, then the Holy City; then he hears of the
   blessings for the inhabitants of the city; and finally, the causes
   which shall have contributed to the exclusion of those who have no part
   in it.

   The "fearful" are those who, through fear, apostatise: (the law
   provides for the cowardly, such as those in Gideon's army, Judges vii.
   3). The "unbelieving" are like those of Titus i. 15. Matt. xi. 20-24.
   The "abominable" are like those in Lev. xviii. 22, 26, 27. And
   "murderers" and "sorcerers," i.e., those that have commerce with
   unclean and lying spirits. These will abound in Antichrist's day; as
   will all the others here named.

   We now come to the final two visions of the Bride and the City,
   described in xxi. 9-- 5.

   A., xxi. 9-- 5.  Vision.
   The Bride or the Holy City.

   g. (see above), xxi. 9-21. Description. The Holy City.

   xxi. 9. And there came [426] one of the seven angels which had the
   seven vials full of the last seven plagues, and talked with me,
   saying,

   "Come hither, I will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's wife."]

   Here we are told exactly what was going to be shown to John. It was one
   of the Seven angels who had already shown John "great Babylon."

   In order to see the harlot city (xvii. 1), John is taken into the
   wilderness (xvii. 3). To see the Holy City he is carried to a great
   mountain. (xxi. 10).

   It was the same with Ezekiel in chap. xl. 2.

   We are not left to our own imagination as to what this Holy City is. We
   are distinctly told that it is i.e., represents or contains "the
   Bride."

   In chap. xix. we had the wife, (...) (gune). Here we have the Bride,
   (...) (numphe). The one was before the Millennium; the other, the
   latter, is after it.

   It does not say that the latter was then and there formed, but only
   that, at that point of the Vision, John saw it "coming down from
   heaven," where it had been; but, for how long we are not told.

   If the wife (chap. xix) was Israel; then this Bride is not Israel, but
   "of Israel."

   We must remember the three distinct "callings" revealed in Scripture.

   (1). We have the earthly calling of Israel, called out from all
   nations, for blessing in the Land. Israel was the "wife," and is so
   spoken of all through the Old Testament; and the marriage will be
   consummated when Rev. xix. 8 shall be fulfilled.

   (2). We have "the heavenly calling," distinctly spoken of as such in
   Heb. iii. 1, of which a certain class of believing Israelites were
   "partakers." Among these we may put all those whom we speak of as "the
   Old Testament Saints."

   In spite of the earthly promises to Israel, and in the midst of all
   those who cherished those earthly promises, there was an elect
   "heavenly calling" of those whose hopes were not earthly, but heavenly.
   They looked for no earthly portion, but they looked forward with a
   heavenly hope to a heavenly blessing. As it is written:

   "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
   seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
   confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims (Gen. xxiii. 4. 1 Pet.
   ii. 11) on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly
   that they seek a COUNTRY... a better country , that is, an HEAVENLY,
   wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath
   prepared for them a CITY" (Heb. xi. 13-16). And of Abraham it is said
   (verse 10): "He looked for THE CITY which hath FOUNDATIONS, whose
   builder and maker is God."

   When the angel, therefore, says to John (Rev. xxi. 9), "Come hither, I
   will show thee the Bride, the Lamb's wife... and he showed me that
   great CITY, the holy Jerusalem descending out of HEAVEN from God," what
   can we conclude but that here, we have that "better country," and "the
   City" for which the Old Testament saints belonging to the "heavenly
   calling" looked?

   It will also be noted that the names "on the GATES" of the city are
   "the names of the twelve TRIBES of the children of Israel" (Rev. xxi.
   12), while the names "in the FOUNDATIONS" are "the names of the TWELVE
   APOSTLES of the Lamb" (verse 14).

   If this be not "the CITY" for which they and the Elect Remnant looked,
   then we ask, for what "City" did they look? Certainly not for an
   earthly city; but for this, of which we now see them, its blessed and
   happy inhabitants. No other city has these foundations; no other city
   has apostles and prophets to prophesy concerning God as its builder.
   God builds one City, His prophets and apostles are all concerned for
   the building of the City of the eternal ages. Their message concerning
   this city came from its builder and maker. The builder of it puts their
   names in the foundations of its walls; and the adornment of its
   foundations are the names of the twelve apostles. No other city could
   have such immortal, priceless foundations. Blessed foundations. This
   was the city; for this alone has foundations, all others will have
   vanished in smoke; this abides. This, then, is what Abraham, and his
   seed, by faith, looked for. This is the Holy City.

   (3). Then, we have the other "calling," of which we read in Eph. i. 18,
   iv. 1. It is a "holy calling" (2 Tim. i. 9). It is a Divine calling.

   If we identify the calling of the Church of God with the other callings
   we cannot but have confusion.

   Here, in Rev. xxi., we have the New Heaven and the New Earth; we have
   the Twelve Tribes of Israel; and Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. We ask,
   What has all this to do with the Church-- Body of Christ? Has it not to
   do only and solely with the Holy City and with the Bride of the Lamb?
   The promise of Christ to the Twelve Apostles in Matt. xix. 28 (though
   that doubtless has its special fulfilment in the Millennium) has never
   been abrogated: but, we ask, what are we to do with it, if the Apostles
   form part of the Body of Christ? The Church is part of Christ, the
   Bridegroom; but the Apostles, here, form part of the Bride. [427]

   In harmony also with this is the teaching of


   EPHESIANS V. 25-33.

   Christians, in their selfishness, intrude themselves into the place of
   others as the Bride, and thus lose the blessed enjoyment of their own
   place which is theirs as part of the Bridegroom!

   The Bride and the Bridegroom, though in a sense one, are yet distinct.
   And it is clear from all the scriptures relating to the Mystery, that
   the members of Christ's Body are part of the Bridegroom Himself.
   Whereas the elect Old Testament saints will form the Bride. See Isaiah
   xii. 6: "Cry out and shout, thou Inhabitress (marg.) of Zion: For great
   is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee." In Rev. xxii. 3, we
   read "The throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it." Of the glory
   of this Holy City other scriptures speak. See Is. lx. 3, 14, 19, 20.
   Rev. xxi. 23, 24, 27. Is. liv. 11, 12.

   True, the Apostle might address the saints concerning his desire to
   present them "as a chaste virgin to Christ" (2 Cor. xi. 2). But this no
   more declares that the Church is the Bride of Christ than that the
   Apostle himself was their father (1 Cor. iv. 15); or that he was their
   mother (Gal. iv. 19). In the one case he spoke of the painful anxiety
   of a mother; in another of the loving care of a father; while, in 2
   Cor. xi. 2, he spoke of the jealousy of the friend of a bridegroom. The
   "Mystery" was a totally different thing.

   So, in Eph. vi. 28, 29, the argument is that husbands "ought to love
   their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth
   himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
   cherisheth it, even as the Lord, the Church, for we are members of His
   Body," i.e., AS Christ loves HIS OWN BODY (Himself and the Church); so
   ought husbands to love their wives. Thus "the great secret" is employed
   as an argument as to the reciprocal duties of husbands and wives. In
   neither case is it said that the Church IS the wife, or that Christ IS
   the husband. But that AS Christ loves His Body (Himself and the
   Church), SO husbands ought to love their own bodies (i.e., themselves
   and their wives).

   The one thing that is clear, is that the Church is the Body of Christ;
   and that the members of that Body being "in Christ," are PART OF THE
   BRIDEGROOM. They cannot possibly, therefore, be the Bride herself as
   separate and distinct from the Bridegroom.

   Another thing that is certain is that the mystery of the Church was not
   revealed in the Old Testament, but was "hid in God" (Eph. iii. 9) and
   "kept secret" (Rom. xvi. 25); "hid from ages and from generations"
   (Col. i. 26).

   It is one thing to see an illustration of the Church in the Old
   Testament; but it is quite another thing to say that this is there
   revealed, which God distinctly declares was not revealed!


   GEN. xxiv.

   has been, for example, widely taken as typical of Christ and the
   Church. Isaac is taken as the bridegroom, and Rebekah as the Church or
   the bride. True, the chapter is illustrative, but not of the Church.
   The bridegroom and the bride were both "ready" before either was called
   to the marriage. The bride was found in the house of Abraham's brother.
   Very special injunctions were given that she was not to be of "the
   Canaanites." "But," said Abraham to Eliezer, "thou shalt go unto my
   country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac... thou
   shalt take a wife for my son from thence." Great emphasis is placed on
   this important condition in verses 3, 4, 7, 37, 38. Abraham and Nahor
   were brothers, and by Isaac's marriage with Rebekah, and Jacob's
   marriage with her brother Laban's daughters (Leah and Rachel), the
   whole house of Nahor was absorbed into the family of Abraham! In direct
   contrast with this, it is again and again affirmed that the Church is
   composed of both Jews and Gentiles. These together make up, with Christ
   the Head, "one new man" (Eph. ii. 15). But Gentiles were expressly shut
   when this typical wife was chosen; and Isaac, on receiving his bride,
   took her at once "into his mother Sarah's tent," thus forming the
   ground of the type as expounded in Gal. iv. 21-31.

   Rebekah therefore represents, not the Mystery of Christ and the Church,
   but that great cloud of witnesses (the Old Testament saints), who, in
   the old dispensation, sacrificed, as she did, all worldly advantages
   for the Lord's sake. It is for these He is preparing that "city which
   hath foundations," and of which He Himself is the Divine Architect. And
   truly, it is said of these, "if they had been mindful of that country
   from whence they came out (as Rebekah came), they might have had
   opportunity to return. But now they desire a better country, that is,
   an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for
   He hath prepared for them a city" (Heb. xi. 15, 16).

   It seems to us, therefore, quite clear that neither the "wife" in chap.
   xix. nor the Bride in chap. xxi. is the Church of God. The former is
   clearly referred to in the Parable of the "Ten Virgins" (Matt. xxv.),
   and in the prophecy of Psalm xlv. All these Scriptures are clear if we
   will only leave out the Church; but, all is confusion the moment we
   introduce it.

   But, to return to this "Holy City," we repeat that all in this chapter
   (as in this whole Book) is intensely real.

   It is a real city. Yet Barnes says, "no man can suppose that this is
   literally true." No! We do not "suppose" it, because we believe it to
   be true; and we find it easier to believe what God says, than to
   understand man's interpretation of it. It is strange that while
   materializing all really spiritual truths, interpreters should protest
   against the materialisation of those who would understand this of a
   literal city.

   All other cities are shadows, if you like: for they all pass away;
   consequently, if this city be not real, then there never could have
   been the idea in God, of a city. We should have a word for which there
   would be no thought: a shadow without a substance!

   Yes, this city is real, and its eternal duration is real also: for
   "there shall be no more curse" (xxii. 3).

   This shows that it cannot refer to Millennial times, for the curse is
   seen in all its sin and wrath immediately on its close.

   "Come and I will show thee the Bride," the angel says.

   xxi. 10. "And he carried me away by (the) spirit (or in spirit) to a
   mountain great and high, and showed me the holy [428] city Jerusalem,
   descending out of heaven from God, (11) having the glory of God: her
   radiance was like a stone most precious, even as a jasper stone, clear
   as crystal;]      Man says that "the idea of a city literally
   descending from heaven .... is absurd." [429] But we ask, Why? True, it
   is contrary to our experience. But, are we to think everything absurd
   because we have heard nothing like it before? We suppose it must ever
   be so with man. It was for this reason that travelling by railway was
   at first thought absurd! To get from London to New York in a fortnight
   was once thought absurd! For carriages to go without horses was an
   "idea" once thought to be absurd! To telegraph without wires was once
   thought absurd!

   For many generations no swans were known other than white ones; and our
   experience would have lead us to conclude that all swans were white.
   But now we know that in Australia there are black swans.

   The experience of the savage is that wood will float, and iron will
   sink: hence, he will conclude an iron ship to be an impossibility.

   Many things we once thought, when measured by our experience, to be
   absurd have been proved to be the contrary.

   And so it will be with this wondrous city. Absurd! It would be absurd
   if God had no new and glorious things in store for man in a new Earth.
   Why is a new Earth less absurd than this Holy City? With man it may be
   impossible; and it may seem improbable. But "with God all things are
   possible." And he has prepared us for the revelation of it by saying to
   John "Write, for these words are faithful and true" (verse 5). In the
   face of this declaration, Who shall dare to question the reality of
   this description? Man only exposes his folly and ignorance when he
   dares to question whether this is a literal city. Great Babylon was a
   literal city. Herodotus tells us that it was 120 furlongs on each side.
   Why should not this Holy City be 12000? Babylon had a wall 50 royal
   cubits wide and 200 in height. Why should not a wall of this Holy City
   be 144 cubits high? Babylon had 100 gates of bronze. Why should not
   this have 12 gates of pearl? In other words, why not believe what God
   says? It is simpler, easier and happier.

   There is a striking resemblance here to the earthly city described in
   Ezek. xl.--

   But the two cities are distinct in their origin and source; and
   therefore not likely to be identical in their dimensions or character.
   Those who take the earthly city and the heavenly city to be the same,
   will necessarily be confused in their minds, and with their pens.

   As to its light. There will be "no need of the sun." Its light is
   mysterious. Man once thought he knew all about "light," and raised
   objections against Gen. i. 3, because it was called into existence
   before the sun, moon, and stars. But since the discovery of the "X
   rays," man has found that he really knows very little about light; and
   Professor Rontgen has himself confessed as much when, asked what light
   is, he replied that at present no one could venture to come to any
   conclusions. So it is better to believe God, and to wait till man has
   discovered some more mistakes in things he once thought he knew.

   Let us listen further to God's description of this Holy City:

   xxi. 12. And it had a wall great and high, and twelve gates, and at the
   gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are (the names
   [430] ) of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel: (13) On the east
   three gates; and [431] on the north three gates; and [432] on the south
   three gates; and [433] on the west three gates. (14)And the wall of the
   city had twelve foundations, and on [434] them twelve [435] names of
   the twelve apostles of the Lamb.]      Twelve is the number that runs
   through all the measurements of this city. For twelve is the number of
   governmental perfection; [436] and here, God's government is supreme.
   All is in harmony, and the very numbers and measurements are used in
   absolute perfection. The order in the cardinal points is E.N.S.W.; in
   Numbers it is E.S.W.N.; in Ezek. xlii 16-19 it is the same as here;
   while in Ezek. xlviii. 16, 30-34 it is N.E.S.W.

   The woman in chap. xii. had the changeful moon for her foundation.
   Great Babylon had the Wild Beast. But this city has twelve foundations.

   The names inscribed thereon are the names of the Twelve Apostles of the
   Lamb. The Twelve who followed the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of God, when on
   earth. These are separated from the other apostles, given after the
   Ascension of Christ, to the Church of God (Eph. iv. 11-15).

   All this shows that Israel is in question here, and not the Church of
   God. The Church is part of the Bridegroom, and will then be "with
   Christ." This city is separate from Christ, and occupies a distinct and
   separate position as the Bride.

   The Twelve Apostles are associated with the Twelve Tribes, and not with
   the Church of God. Paul's name is not here, nor are the other
   subsequent apostles of the Church. Abraham "looked for a city which
   hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Heb. xi. 10). Here
   is that city; and here are the foundations. God is its maker and
   builder.


   The Dimensions of the City.

   xxi. 15. And he that talked with me had a measuring-rod of gold to
   measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. (16) And
   the city lieth four square, and its length is as great as its breadth:
   and he measured the city with the reed, 12,000 stadia (Eng., furlongs).
   The length and the breadth, and the height of it are equal. (17) And he
   measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits,
   according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.]      This
   means that, in the matter of measure, angels and men use the same.

   In Ezek. xlviii. 16 we first have the measurement of each side 4,500.
   In verse 35 we have the total of the circumference 18,000.

   When a square is given, it is usual to state the measure of one of the
   sides definitely, as in Ezek. xlv. 2; xlviii. 16-20, 30, 32-34.

   In this case, the city will be 1,500 miles square. Otherwise the whole
   measure is first given, and then we have to divide it into four before
   we can have the measure of the sides, which is the point in question.

   The "wall" is quite a different matter. That is 144 cubits high, equal
   all round.

   We have the shadow of it in Exodus xxiv. Sinai, changed in character
   (because of the better blood than that of verse 6), to Sion. In Exodus
   we have Moses and Aaron, his two sons, and seventy Elders of Israel
   upon the Mount; and we are told that they saw the God of Israel, that
   they ate and drank there, and that He laid not His hands on the nobles
   of Israel. We have in verse 4 the twelve pillars, which appear to
   answer to the Twelve Apostles. Now, all this was preliminary to the
   Lord dwelling in their midst. The time had not come for the people to
   dwell about and upon the Mount with God. The people were in a
   transition stage; therefore, a sanctuary was needful. But the heavenly
   Jerusalem is a magnificent mountain (Heb. xii. 22).

   The inhabitants in this glorious dwelling dwell upon the Mount of God,
   and therefore the measurement belongs to its height, as well as to its
   length and breadth; and as Mount Sinai was once fenced off, so also is
   the New Jerusalem. At Sinai, Israel was outside the fence; but inasmuch
   as Moses, Joshua, and the Elders of Israel were admitted within the
   bounds, we see foreshadowed this city of the New Jerusalem. Under these
   conditions, therefore, the measure 12,000 refers to but one side;
   otherwise, the height of the city is not specified at all, which would
   be necessary if only the sum total of the four sides had been given.

   Some have taken the measure 12,000 furlongs to be that of the
   circumference. But to this it may be answered that, as only one
   measurement is given, it must belong to one item of the city; because,
   otherwise, he gives a measurement which must first be divided by four
   before we know the length, breadth, and height; whereas, if he gives
   the measurement in one direction, and then tells us that all the other
   directions are equal to the one given, we have everything clear,
   without any roundabout way of getting at the thing intended. And, as we
   have to do with the Mount of God, which is the throne of God (Rev.
   xxii. 1) -- Gen. xxii. 14 is fulfilled in Rev. v. 6; xxi. 22-- where is
   there any difficulty in taking the one measurement as giving the
   length, breadth, or height? Is 375 miles high easier to believe than
   1500?


   The Materials of the City.

   xxi. 18. And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
   was pure gold, like unto clear glass. (19) And the foundations of the
   wall of the city were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The
   first foundation was a jasper (dark green, and transparent, with red
   veins): the second, a sapphire (azure blue, almost transparent): the
   third, a chalcedony (a kind of agate or onyx, probably bluish-white,
   and semi-transparent): the fourth, an emerald (a vivid green): (20) the
   fifth, a sardonyx (a mixture of chalcedony and cornelian, a flesh
   colour): the sixth, a sardius (probably the cornelian, the red being
   sometimes vivid): the seventh, a chrysolite (yellow or gold in colour,
   and transparent): the eighth, a beryl (of a sea-green colour): the
   ninth, a topaz (to-day a yellow, but among the ancients it was a pale
   green): the tenth, a chrysoprasus (pale yellow and green, classed by
   moderns under topaz): the eleventh, a jacinth (a deep red flame colour
   or violet colour): the twelfth, an amethyst (a violet colour).]      It
   is somewhat difficult to identify these stones with exactness, some of
   them being of various colours. But if we made a selection from the
   above, where we have a choice, they may be arranged thus:

   X  {    Green (Jasper)
                   Blue (Sapphire)
                   Blue (Chalcedony)
              Green (Emerald)
                           Y {    Red (Sardonyx)
                                     Red (Sardine)
   X  {    Yellow (Chrysolite)
                   Green (Beryl)
              Yellow (Topaz)
                   Green (Chrysoprasus)
                           Y {    Violet ( Jacinth)
                                     Violet (Amethyst)

   It will be observed that the twelve are arranged, according to colour,
   into sets of four alternating with sets of two; each pair of two
   differing from the pair of fours by being similar (Red and Violet
   respectively).

   The first pair of four is arranged as an introversion, the second pair
   is arranged as an alternation.

   xxi. 21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates
   respectively was of one pearl: and the street (or street material) of
   the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass]      The word
   "street" can scarcely mean that the city had only one thoroughfare; so
   that it seems better to take the word generally, as denoting the street
   material of which all the streets were made.

   (...) (plateia), however, means any wide, open space, such as the
   large, central square common to most cities; and this is included, if
   we take it of all the space not built on; or as the street material,
   which is gold instead of mud.

   The Plateia will doubtless be a broad open space. A place for public
   gatherings. Not a street, as we know it. For this Plateia has the River
   of Life flowing through it, and the Tree of Life growing in it.
   Thoroughfares there will of course be; but there is a reason for this
   wide, open space. It reproduces Paradise.

   The twelve gates imply the thoroughfares; but the gates are not for
   defence; only for ornament: and therefore constructed with that view.


   h., xxi. 22-27. Privileges.

   xxi. 22. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty and
   the Lamb, are the Temple of it.]      No temple or "place of worship"
   is needed; for the whole city is hallowed and pervaded by the presence
   of God. This fact separates that part of the book from the former part,
   where the temple is seen (iii. 12; vii. 15; xi. 1, 16-19; xiv. 15, 17;
   xv. 5, 6, 8; xvi. 1, 17); and shows that we are here carried far beyond
   millennial times.

   xxi. 23. And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
   that they should shine on her: [437] for the glory of God illumined
   her, and the Lamb is her light.]      The dwelling-place of God's glory
   in the Tabernacle and the Temple on Earth had no light of sun or moon;
   for the Shechinah or glory of God was sufficient. This also marks off
   the period as being post-millennial; for during the Millennium "the
   light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of
   the sun shall be seven-fold" (Isa. xxx. 26). This refers to the Earth,
   though even then the Holy City in the Land will be independent of the
   sun and moon (see Isa. lx. 19, 20; and iv. 5).

   24. And the nations [438] shall walk (or travel) by means of her light:
   and the kings of the earth do bring their glory [439] into her. (25)
   And her gates shall never be shut at all by day: for night shall not
   exist there (it will be always day). (26) And they shall bring the
   glory and honour of the nations unto it.]      So that nations will
   exist on the new Earth.

   What is the origin of these Nations (Rev. xxi. 24)? Matt. xxv. 31-46
   supplies the clue. When the Lord has put down all earthly oppositions,
   then those nations which remain are gathered together, and their status
   for the Millennium is determined: and it is determined by their conduct
   to the Jew, as shown by the term "My brethren." The result is, there
   are nations other than Israel, who enter into the earthly kingdom of
   the Son of man.

   Now, as sin broke out in the garden, so also once more, sin breaks out
   among the nations under the Lord's Sovereignty after the Millennium.

   The question is, do the terms "Gog and Magog" (xx. 8) include every
   nation (apart from Israel) at the end of the Millennium? The terms Gog
   and Magog imply that only certain nations are concerned, and their
   locality also indicates the same thing-- dwell at the "four quarters of
   the earth." They are those that are fartherest away from the capital of
   the earth-- four corners. "The nations that are in the four corners of
   the earth." The devil's deceit includes the same idea that Jeroboam
   acted out 1 Kings xii. 27-33. It is to be observed that the "four
   corners," are distinct from the "breadth" of the earth; that is, that
   the "four corners" lie beyond the "breadth." These considerations
   localise Gog and Magog, and show that the rebellion is not universal.

   The "four corners" then represent the extreme limits of the earth,
   which has Jerusalem for its centre; so that the points of the compass,
   N.S.E.W. are related to Jerusalem, and mean the fartherest habitable
   parts of the earth in these directions.

   Going up "upon the breadth of the earth" suggest a considerable width
   of territory, practically unoccupied; hence, that the people of Gog had
   purposely got as far away from the centre of government as they could.
   As their hearts were far away, so they removed their persons; hence,
   Satan would easily find entrance to their foolish minds, to set up
   their own government, and then go en masse armed to throw off the yoke
   and get possession of the wonderful tree.

   This leaves it open, that, at the end of the Millennium, the same
   experience will obtain as at the beginning: namely, that there will be
   "nations" for the Lord's right hand, or in other words, there will be
   nations to introduce to the New Kingdom upon the New Earth, and with
   this we may connect the Lord's promise to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 20, in
   connection with xxv. 1-4. Rom. iv. 16, 17 seems to include all who
   possess Abraham's faith-- 16, "US all." Now, if the same experience as
   to the nations, obtains at the end of the Millennium, as at the
   beginning, we see the "Whence" of the nations of Rev. xxi. 24. Those
   nations, during the Millennium, that walk in the Divine light of the
   earthly Jerusalem, are transferred to the new earth, to walk in the
   Heavenly light of the New Jerusalem.

   We notice also, the same characteristic of the "goats" Matt. xxv.; they
   depart into an abiding fire, with Gog and Magog of Rev. xx. 9.

   But only "kings" will "enter into" the city. This looks as if these
   "kings" were something more than individuals selected out of the
   nations to rule them.

   The words, "of the saved," are spurious, being a later addition,
   arising from the traditional belief that there are only two
   classes--"saved and lost." But, as we have before observed, there are
   several classes of the saved, as there are several resurrections,
   differing in glory as star differs from star. Here, then, there are the
   nations with their kings; there are the citizens of this holy city;
   there is the Bride; there is the Church of God (occupying the highest
   place of all). The nations are not the Church; neither are the citizens
   of this holy city. But the mystery of Christ and the Church has its own
   peculiar privilege and destiny described in its own Church Epistles.
   Subordination is the Divine plan of government, for eternity as well as
   for time. Israel will be subordinate to the Twelve Apostles; the
   overcomers will have precedence over the nations (Rev. ii. 26; xii. 5);
   and the Church will rule angels (1 Cor. vi. 3). While the Holy City is
   independent of created luminaries, the nations are not independent of
   the light of the city. They need no guide thither, for her light is a
   constant pillar of cloud and of fire.

   xxi. 27. And there shall never enter into her anything unclean, or
   whosoever worketh abomination, and a lie (or a lying abomination): but
   only (lit., except) those who are written in the Lamb's book of
   life.]      This does not imply that there will then be any unclean
   thing that could enter in to defile it. It merely contrasts this with
   all other cities which have ever existed. It follows from this, that
   the nations then on the earth, and their kings, are written in the book
   of life. It also follows that these, being among the saved, there must
   be different parties of saved ones. All saved from the same eternal
   doom, but not all saved for the same state in glory. All will be in the
   eternal glory, but in different positions. The nations will occupy
   their own place; while Israel and the Church will occupy theirs,
   respectively.

   The "working abomination" refers to idolatry: either to the making of
   idols [440] or the worshipping of them. [441] The contrast is not
   between these and others then on the earth; but between these dwellers
   and all former dwellers; between this city and all former cities.

   The following first five verses of chap. xxii. form part of the last of
   these Visions. There ought never to have been a chapter division here.
   Chap. xxi. should end at xxii. 5; and chap. xxii. should commence at
   xxii. 6; containing, as it does, the Conclusion of the book, and
   corresponding exactly with the Introduction in chap. i, as we shall see
   below.

   It is the description of Paradise Regained which is the great subject
   of these five verses. It is not what man would have imagined, for he
   looks for an unsubstantial, spiritual existence. But here we have
   substance, and realities far grander than those in the book of Genesis.
   Here is the complement of Gen. i. and ii., where the beginnings and the
   endings meet and harmonise, and complete the whole. Gen. i, ii. is the
   "beginning." Rev. xxi. 1-- 5 is the "end."


   g. xxii. 1, 2. Description.

   Paradise regained and Eden restored.

   xxii. 1. And he showed me a [442] river of living water, clear as
   crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. (2) In
   the midst of the street of (the city) and of the river, on this side
   and on that side, was there the tree of life (i.e., trees of that
   kind), producing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit according to
   each month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations (which are thus distinguished from the Citizens of the Holy
   City). (3) And there shall be no longer any curse: and the throne of
   God and of the Lamb shall be in her: and His servants shall serve Him;
   (4) and they shall see His face: and His name shall be on their
   foreheads. (5) And there shall be no longer [443] any night: and they
   have no need of a lamp or (lit., and)light of the sun; because the Lord
   God will give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.]
   There is a similar provision for Millennial days (Ezek. xlvii. 12). But
   these final Visions of Paradise regained are as far beyond the
   Millennial City, as that will be beyond the past and present Jerusalem.
   All are literal and real.

   We have the city and its light; and the river and trees; and the
   relations of the citizens and nations to all. It was promised to the
   overcomers in Rev. ii. 7, and the fulfilment is recorded in xxii. 14,
   17. The overcomers are literal beings: so are the leaves of this tree
   for their use. Its healing leaves do not imply disease or suffering or
   pain, but clearly refer to the eating of the "tree of life" (Gen. ii.
   9; iii. 22, 23, 24), and the prolongation of life "for ever."

   That "tree of life" was intended to preserve Adam and Eve in life. But
   the fall entailed the loss of that wondrous gift. The man was driven
   out of the garden for the special reason that it should not be possible
   for him to eat of it: for the reason given is, "lest he put forth his
   hand, and take also of the tree of life; and eat and live for ever."

   It is clear from this that the "tree of life" was the means by which
   Adam would have lived on for ever. Hence in the very day of his
   disobedience he was cut off from it, and his death was certain and
   sure.

   So important was it that he should not "live for ever" in his sin and
   shame, that Cherubim and a flaming sword were placed to keep and
   preserve both it and him from this evil.

   Eternal life was to be obtained and enjoyed henceforth only in and
   through Christ. "The Tree of life" was to be preserved; and here it is
   in Paradise, restored. No mere present "intermediate state" as
   Tradition teaches; but a future glorious restoration of the Paradise
   lost. The tree of life will also be restored; and, by its leaves, life
   will be preserved and prolonged for ever and ever. No created being can
   stand apart from the Creator. The very mention of the Tree immediately
   brings to mind the curse, and we are told that it will then be no more.

   The Bible begins with the description of man in Eden, the garden of the
   Lord, the Paradise of God. What God's counsels were with regard to that
   garden are not revealed; for all was broken by the entrance of the old
   Serpent: and not until he shall have been cast into the lake of fire,
   will those counsels, for man, be renewed, restored, and carried out.

   Elohim had created man; and, as Jehovah Elohim, He visited man in that
   garden -- revealing Himself and His wondrous works to man (Gen. ii. 19,
   20). After the first sin, Adam and his wife hear the sound of the
   footsteps coming at the wonted hour of this Divine Communion (Gen. iii.
   8). But Satan introduced himself, and insinuated doubts into the minds
   of our first parents as to the truth of God's words (Gen. iii. 1). He
   told them that the consequences of disobedience would not be as God had
   said. Eve had prepared the way for this by putting as a contingency
   ("lest ye die," Gen. iii. 3), that which God had announced as a
   certainty ("Ye shall surely die," Gen. ii. 17). Satan at once seizes on
   this and assures them "Ye shall not surely die." They believed Satan's
   lie instead of God's truth. Here was their sin. They soon discovered
   which was truth, for the sentence was speedily executed; they were
   driven out from the Paradise of God; and, cut off from "the tree of
   life," they began to die the very day they ate of the tree of
   knowledge.

   Students of God's Word have lost sight of all this foundation truth. It
   lies on the very threshold of the Scriptures, and is of infinite
   importance if we would understand all that is subsequently revealed.

   The one question henceforth is, How shall man get back to that Paradise
   which he has lost? The very next chapter tells us. In Gen. iv. we have,
   as the first step revealed, God's way, which Abel took; and man's way,
   which Cain invented. There never have been other than those two ways --
   "the way of God" on the one hand, and "the way of Cain" (Jude 11) on
   the other. In the one way, the believing sinner is brought to the
   confession

   "Nothing in my hand I bring."

   In the other, independent, rebellious man says the opposite --
   "Something in my hand I bring." This is the one thing common to all
   systems of religion. They quarrel and fight to the death over the
   question as to what that "Something" is to be: but they are all at one
   in agreeing that it must be something. And so the weary conflict has
   gone on, and will continue to the end.

   It is that end which we have before us here. And it is the object of
   the Apocalypse to tell us how that end will be reached.

   "The Jew, and the Gentile, and the Church of God" (1 Cor. x. 32) each
   has its own destiny--

   "The Church of God" will have been caught up to meet the Lord in the
   air, long before this, to enjoy its blessed portion for ever with the
   Lord.

   "Israel" will have been "planted" in its own inheritance.

   And now the Gentile, mankind as a whole, will regain the Paradise lost;
   and, in Eden restored, will have the glories and joys of God's
   manifested presence, as described in Rev. xxii. 1-5, 14, 17.

   Tradition has made the Word of God of none effect. Paradise is always
   used in Scripture of a definite place from Genesis to Revelation. It is
   described in Gen. ii.; it is lost in Gen. iii.; its restoration is
   spoken of in Luke xxiii. 43; it is seen in vision, in 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4;
   it is promised in Rev. ii. 7. And here (Rev. xxiii. 1-5, 14, 17), we
   see the promise fulfilled, and the lost Paradise become Paradise
   regained. "The tree of life" and "the water of life" were, and will
   ever be, its chief distinguishing marks of blessedness.

   Man ignores all this, and has turned Paradise into a present place, to
   which he has given his own name, and calls it "the Intermediate State"
   -- a term unknown to Scripture! There is no "tree of life" in it; and
   no "water of life." It is man's Tradition pure and simple; and is a
   poor substitute for the substantial glories of Divine revelation.

   If Tradition be true, then Rev. xxii. is false, and there can be no
   "Paradise of God" at all.

   The "Higher Critics" tell us that the Paradise of Gen. ii., iii., is a
   myth, and Christians generally treat the Paradise of Rev. ii. 7; xxii.
   1-5, 14, 17 as a myth; for having substituted a present Paradise with
   Abraham's bosom" and "a great gulf" instead of "the tree of life" and
   "the water of life," they have no place left for the Paradise of God,
   which is to be restored.

   There are not two Paradises in the place of the one that was lost.
   Hence, by receiving and holding Tradition, they thus practically "take
   away from the words of this book" (xxii. 19) all that is said about it:
   for that solemn warning is given in immediate connection with this
   "water of life," (verse 17), and this "tree of life" (verse 14). [444]

   The word "servants" (verse 3) tells us that the church of God is not
   here. They shall "see His face" refers back to our first parents, who
   hid themselves among the trees of the garden. They shall reign in a
   higher sense than those in Rev. xx. 4-6; and that, not for a thousand
   years, but for ever and ever.

   This is the brief summary of the New Heavens and the New Earth; of
   Paradise regained; of the Holy City, and its inhabitants; and all the
   people of the New Earth. More is said below.

                                 The Conclusion

   A. xxii. 6-21.
   The Conclusion of the Whole Book.


   This Conclusion is modelled precisely on the same lines, as to
   structure, as the Introduction. It is brief and very impressive. Its
   scope seems to be to anticipate the difficulties of the reader, by
   assuring him again and again as to the solemnity and truth of the words
   of this book.

   Their absolute truth and certainty are pressed upon us. Thrice it is
   repeated in this Book that these sayings are "faithful and true": xix.
   9; xxi. 5; xxii. 6. In the Introduction and Conclusion it is (three
   times) affirmed that these words came from God (and not, therefore,
   from John, though they came through John): in i. 1 and xxii. 6, 16. In
   both also is a blessing pronounced on the readers and keepers of this
   book: i. 3 and xxii. 7.

   This is what the Book claims to be. If these claims be not true, then
   the book is nothing better than a forgery; and is unworthy of our
   attention or consideration.

   It seems to be the one great purpose of this Conclusion to press these
   claims upon us in the strongest possible manner.

   Four times we have the person testifying; and four times the things
   testified. Four times we have the nearness of the Advent proclaimed;
   and four times the blessing announced.

   The following is the Structure, and when we compare it with the
   Introduction, we shall at once see that it is constructed on the same
   model:--

   Benediction.  "The grace of our Lord" (i. 4, 5).


   The First Four Members.

   a^1. xxii. 6-. The Angel Testifying.

   xxii. 6-. And he said unto me,]      It is the angel of i. 1,
   reassuring John as to the truth of what he had been "sent" to show and
   to tell him.


   b^1. xxii. -6. The Things Testified.

   -6. "These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the spirits
   [445] of the prophets sent his angel to show unto His servants things
   which must come to pass speedily.]      The reading "spirits of the
   prophets" must be taken as the Figure Metonymy, by which the word
   "spirits" is put for the gifts of the Spirit, as in 1 Cor. xiv. 12, 32,
   &c. And the Figure is used to emphasise the fact that the revelations
   made by the prophets were given by the Holy Spirit of God; and were not
   their own sending forth or of themselves. Here, note also that it is
   still the "servants" of God who are specially addressed as being
   concerned in the interpretation of this book.


   c^1. xxii. 7-. The Advent.

   7-. And [446] behold, I come quickly:]      The words of the Angel pass
   into the words of Christ, which he was commissioned to report. So in
   verse 12, and xi. 3. This corresponds with chap. i. 7, as does xxii.
   16.


   d^1. xxii. -7. The Benediction.

   -7. blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this
   book.]      Again the blessing of i. 3 is repeated, showing the
   importance of the study of this book. And it is "this book"; not merely
   certain parts of it, but the book as a whole. The Lord does not say who
   understand it, but who "keep its sayings" in their hearts, for the time
   is at hand; i.e., the time next in order to the present.

   No other dispensation is to intervene, and the sayings of this book are
   to be kept for the time that is at hand.


   The Second Four.

   a^2. xxii. 8, 9. The Angel Testifying.

   8. And I John was he who heard and saw these things. [447] And when I
   heard and saw them I feel down to worship before the feet of the angel
   who was showing me these things. (9) And he saith to me "Beware; do it
   not: [448] I am a fellow-servant of thine, and of thy brethren the
   prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book: Worship
   God."]      Again John was about to make the same mistake. The double
   correction shows how firm is the decree that God alone is to receive
   worship; and that it may not be rendered to any created being. Observe,
   also, that the Angel is a "fellow-servant" with John (for all serve
   God). Brotherhood is not restricted to flesh; it is according to
   nature. "Fellow-servant" implies only common service according to
   station and position.


   b^2. xxii. 10, 11. The Things Testified.

   10. And he saith unto me, "Seal not the words of the prophecy of this
   book: for the time is at hand."]      This command is in contrast with
   chap. x. 4, where it is a special prophecy in the midst of general
   prophecies, and is to be sealed up. It is in contrast also with Dan.
   xii. 4, 8, 9, where Daniel was to seal up the Vision, because another
   Dispensation was to intervene before that Vision could be fulfilled.
   That Dispensation concerned the mystery of Christ and the Church. That
   mystery will have been completed long before the Apocalypse opens, and
   therefore the command is given here "Seal not."

   When the Angel commanded Daniel to seal up the Vision, he immediately
   added, "Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
   wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand"
   (Dan. xii. 10).

   When the Angel, here, commands John not to seal up the prophecy,
   similar words are immediately added:

   11. He that is unjust (pres. part. of condition), let him act unjustly
   still (aor., relating to acts, not to condition): and he that is
   defiled (morally polluted), let him defile himself still: and he that
   is righteous, let him work [449] righteousness still: and he that is
   holy, let him be holy still.]      These mysteriously solemn words have
   no reference to the Post-Millennial or Eternal state. They are given as
   a present statement, and as a reason for the injunction to "Seal not,"
   which immediately precedes them.

   (1) "Seal not the words." Proclaim them; make them known; even though
   evil men go on in their wickedness, and the righteous in their
   righteousness. Yea, though none heed them, and the wise reject them,
   "Seal them not." The injunction is for those who shall belong to the
   period when that which is now called "the time at hand" shall have
   become time present. In that case, they belong to the time of the
   Apostasy.

   (2) "The time is nigh." Let men go on their way; the time is short. As
   though it said, in the spirit of Matt. xxvi. 45, "Sleep on now, and
   take your rest; the hour is at hand." Compare Ezek. iii. 27.

   (3) A third reason follows. Let the wicked go on with his wickedness,
   and the righteous in his righteousness. My advent is near; and my
   judgment and my reward are with me.


   c^2. xxii. 12, 13. The Advent.

   12. [450] Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to
   every man as his work is. [451] (13) I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
   First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.]      This is the great
   reason why the righteous are to persevere and hold on their way. Their
   reward is certain, for the Advent is sure. The Speaker is the Lord
   Jesus; and that He is God is clear from the attributes used of Him; for
   they belong only to God. (See Isa. xli. 4; xliii. 10; xliv. 6; xlviii.
   12). Even though the Angel be the speaker, he speaks in the name of Him
   who commissions him. There are other places in this book where fresh
   speakers are introduced without being named.


   d^2. xxii. 14, 15. The Benediction.

   14. Blessed are they that do His commandments (or wash their robes
   [452] ), that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in
   through the gates into the city.]      It is to be noted that in the
   passage which speaks of washing their robes (vii. 14), it is the past
   tense, because the act is spoken of as having been done in the past by
   those who have come out of the great tribulation. But here, it is in
   the present tense, because the words of the Angel contemplate, not
   those now present in this dispensation of grace, or in the next of
   judgment; but in the yet future dispensation of glory for the citizens
   of the holy city, distinguishing those who had been on the former earth
   from the nations of the new earth. The washing of robes has no
   reference to those in the previous dispensations.

   15. Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers,
   and idolators, and whosoever loveth and practiseth a lie]      These
   are not on the new earth. They are "without," and, according to xxi. 8,
   will have then been cast into the lake which burneth with fire and
   brimstone. The expression "dogs" is used in accordance with Eastern
   idiom of all unclean, vile, and injurious persons.


   The Third Four.

   a^3. xxii. 16-. Jesus Himself Testifying.

   xxii. 16-. I Jesus sent mine angel (i. 1) to testify unto you]      It
   is the Lord Himself again, and the pronoun is emphatic.


   b^3. xxii. -16-. The Things Testified.

   -16-. these things in the assemblies]      It is to the assemblies of
   chaps. ii. and iii. that these things were and will be specially
   testified. For them, this book will have its special interpretation.
   The application is for all the servants of God (i. 1) now, and in all
   time; but the interpretation is specially for the assemblies who will
   be on the earth during the fulfilment of "the prophecy of this book."


   c^3. xxii. -16. The Advent.

   -16. "I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright, the Morning
   Star."]      These titles are essentially and exclusively Jewish: and
   proclaim their owner as the coming one who shall confirm and fulfil all
   the promises made unto David. The Lord Jesus is at once the "Root"
   whence David sprang, and the "Offspring" which sprang from David. (See
   Isa. xi. 1. John viii. 55-59). On this fact the Lord's question was
   based in Matt. xxii. 41-46.

   But there is a third title -- "The Morning Star," which ushers in the
   Eternal day. The reference is to Num. xxiv. 17.


   d^3. xxii. 17. Benediction.

   17. And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come thou, And let him that
   heareth (these things) say, Come thou. And he that thirsteth, let him
   come. And he who willeth (or desireth to enter), let him take of the
   living water freely.]      This defines the Blessing, and goes back to
   the very beginning, embracing the enjoyment of all that was then lost.
   In Gen. iii. 22-24, the solemn sentence was pronounced and executed:--

   "And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
   life, and eat, and live for ever; therefore the Lord God sent him forth
   from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
   So he drove out the man, and he placed (as in a Tabernacle) at the east
   of the Garden of Eden, Cherubim, and a flaming sword, which turned
   every way to keep (or preserve, Gen. ii. 15) the way of the tree of
   life."

   In contrast with the Expulsion from "the tree of life" we have here, at
   the close of the Apocalypse, "right to the tree of life" (verse 14);
   and the Invitation to "the water of life." The seed of the woman had
   been bruised in the heel; the Serpent's head has been crushed. Hence
   the invitation "Come" can now be sent forth.

   Man, who had been "sent forth" and "driven out," now at length sees
   Paradise restored, and hears the blessed invitation, "Come."

   It is interesting to note how this invitation is given.

   The Spirit first gives forth the welcome word, "Come."

   The Bride who has been revealed from heaven repeats it.

   Those who are athirst, and all who will are invited to come and "take
   the water of life freely."

   Israel, who ought to have been the Bride, was blessed, and entrusted
   with the charge to "be a blessing" and to bring in full earthly
   blessing. Israel should have brought back Paradise again.

   But Israel was unfaithful, and instead of being a Bride, became a
   harlot (Isa. i. 21). Hence, God removed Himself from them; and, the
   Cherubim, the symbols of His presence, were taken away altogether.

   Beautiful it is to see the recovered position of the Remnant, as the
   Bride, giving the invitation to "come" into Paradise restored.

   The first Paradise was in the keeping of Adam and his Bride. The man
   did not lose it for his race. He was "not in the transgression" (1 Tim.
   ii. 14). It was the woman, through Satan, who lost it.

   But now, all is reversed. Satan is cast into the lake of fire; and it
   is the Bride who is privileged to say "Come!"

   "The woman being deceived" was the cause of the sentence to go forth;
   but now, in this blessed time of reversal, she is the one to say
   "Come!"

   The second man, the last Adam, has "restored all things" and "made all
   things new."

   In this we see that Genesis is the book of the beginnings; and the
   Apocalypse is the book of the endings, the complement of Genesis. Gen.
   i., ii. finds its correspondence in Rev. xxi., xxii.; and the last two
   chapters of the Bible refer back to the first two.

   In the previous Benediction (verse 14), the blessing consisted in the
   right to eat of "the tree of life." In this it is the invitation to
   come and drink of "the water of life."

   The first dread sentence is thus reversed, and the New Earth becomes
   Paradise restored.

   "The Tree of Life," and the Water of Life" are the great central
   subjects of the New Earth.


   The Fourth (and Last) Four.

   a^4. xxii. 18-. The Lord Jesus Himself Testifying.

   18-. I [453] testify unto everyone that heareth the words of the
   prophecy of this book,]      The Lord Jesus Himself closes up the whole
   testimony. The pronoun "I" is very emphatic.


   b^4. xxii. -19, 19. The Things Testified.

   -18. If anyone add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
   plagues which are written in this book: (19) And if anyone take away
   from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his
   part from the tree [454] of life, and [out of] the holy city, which are
   written in this book.]      He who has given this book (i. 1) now
   closes it with this solemn warning. This warning, while it may refer
   especially to this book, yet, by a very true application, takes in the
   whole Scripture. But only the prophecy of this book comes within the
   true scope of this passage. The threat shows the extreme importance set
   by God upon this book. The adding of the "plagues" shows also the true
   character of the judgments recorded in the book; which are as real as
   those referred to in Deut. iv. 2; xii. 32.

   There may be a still more literal interpretation which only those will
   understand whose lot will be cast in that dispensation of judgment.


   c^4. xxii. 20. The Advent.

   20. He who testifieth these things saith, "Surely I come quickly.
   Amen."]     So it will verily be.

   This is the final announcement of the coming advent of the Lord Jesus.
   It is given by Himself. This is the one great subject of the whole
   book. It is all "prophecy," and this final promise is the key to its
   interpretation. To this, the Apostle, and all who hear, and read, and
   keep the words of the book of this prophecy, respond with holy,
   heart-felt desire.

   Come, Lord Jesus] the use of the word "Lord" characterises the
   utterance as John's: for none of His people were ever so irreverent as
   to address Him merely as Jesus. He Himself may do so, and say "I,
   Jesus." The Holy inspiring Spirit may call Him "Jesus." But it is
   irreverence of the grossest kind for His people ever to address Him
   other than as Lord, Master, Saviour, or Christ. John speaks of Him
   here, and also in the Benediction that follows, as "Lord."

   The Lord may condescend to call us "brethren" in holy, infinite
   condescension; but it is quite a different thing for us to call Him
   "our elder brother." One great lesson and effect of this book will be
   to inspire us with greater reverence for Him who is at once the author
   and subject of the Revelation.

   Yea: in very deed and truth (He says) "I am coming," and we reply,
   Amen, let it be verified: Come, Lord Jesus; let Thy parting promise be
   speedily fulfilled.


   d^4. xxii. 21. The Benediction.

   21. The grace of [455] the Lord Jesus Christ [456] be with all the
   Saints. Amen. [457] ]      This Benediction not only completes the
   correspondence of the Structure, but appropriately concludes the book,
   for, after all, there was grace in giving Israel the Law, and there
   must be grace even in a dispensation of works. But "true" grace came by
   Jesus Christ. And now, in this dispensation, ALL is of grace. It is
   this that gives the Church its different standing and different
   destiny. May we, while we strive to rightly divide the word of truth,
   know, more and more fully, our own standing in grace; and thus be more
   and more qualified to understand the ways and words of God with
   reference to the coming dispensation of judgment, and the dispensation
   of glory which will follow it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [445] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (pneumaton) spirits of the,
   instead of (...) (ton hagion) the holy.

   [446] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. add "and."

   [447] This is the order of the words according to G.L.Tr.A. WH. and RV.

   [448] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit (...) (gar) for.

   [449] L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (dikaio sunen poiesato) let him
   work righteousness, instead of (...) (dikaiotheto) let him be
   righteous.

   [450] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit "and."

   [451] L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (estin) is, instead of (...)
   (estai) shall be.

   [452] This is the reading of L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV., instead of "keep
   His commandments," as in the AV. The MS. authorities are divided; the
   Vatican MS. (B) supporting the AV., and the Alex. (A) and Sinaitic
   (...) supporting the RV. Thus both are ancient, and the reading of A
   and (...) may have been originally a marginal gloss, finding its way
   later into the Text.
       The Coptic Version also has the "commandments" reading as do the
   Fathers Tertullian, A.D. 200; Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, 248-258;
   Tichonius, 390; Andreas, Cent. x.
       It is curious that, though the great Vatican MS. (B) supports the
   AV., the Vulgate does not follow it, but reads "that wash their robes,"
   according to the Codex Amiatinus (A.D. 541) in Florence, and the Codex
   Fuldensis (Cent. vi.). Three Fathers also support the Vulgate reading,
   viz., Primasius (Cent. vi.); Fulgentius, Bishop in Africa (508-533);
   and Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria (326-373).
       The Clementine Vulgate (Authorized by the Council of Trent) adds,
   "in the blood of the Lamb," though there is no Greek MS. authority for
   it whatsoever.
       All the Romish Versions (including, of course, the English
   "Douai"), being made from the Clementine or Tridentine Vulgate,
   naturally have the full reading-- "that wash their robes in the blood
   of the Lamb"-- the latter part being quite unauthorized by any Greek
   Text, as we have said. They have this reading solely on textual
   grounds, and not because of any Romish or Protestant reasons.
       The two readings are much alike,
                                           (...)
                                           (...)
       The upper line is "that wash their robes." The lower line is "that
   do his commandments." The difference is exceedingly small, especially
   when we remember the (...) is frequently written (...). It looks as
   though the upper line was the original reading; but many hold the
   opposite view.
       In any case it is entirely a question of reading and not of
   translation.

   [453] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. read (...) (marturo ego) I testify,
   instead of (...) ( summarturoumai gar) for I jointly testify.

   [454] So G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV.

   [455] G.L.T.Tr.A. WH. and RV. omit "our."

   [456] L.T.A. RV. (text, not margin), omit "Christ." WH. put it in
   brackets.

   [457] The Textual critics, as well as the oldest MSS., are much divided
   as to these last four words. The weight of evidence is against "you,"
   and in favour of "saints."
     __________________________________________________________________

                                    Appendix

   On the Relation of Astrology to the Apocalypse.


   The Apocalypse has been branded by the enemies of revealed truth as a
   sacred fiction; and the very early Christians had to bear the charge of
   Pagans that on account of there being such a resemblance between it and
   the worship of the SUN, as Tertullian says, they (the Christians) were
   only looked upon as another sect of sun worshippers, and that the
   construction of the book, and the symbols employed, are but borrowed
   ideas from Pagan Mysteries.

   The conditions under which the apostle received these unfoldings as to
   himself, and the manner of presentation -- by word and scenically
   portrayed -- are said to be after the same order and with the same
   formula as that used by the hierophant in his dealings with the
   aspirant as he goes through the ordeal of initiation into those
   mysteries.

   But this, instead of being a difficulty, is really a help to the
   understanding of the book, when we take into account the conditions of
   the period at which it was written, and the purpose God had in view in
   making this the closing book of Inspiration; for it not only reflected
   upon the idolatry then prevailing, but looked onward to the great
   apostacy of the last days when that idolatry shall through Satanic
   energy again prevail and become the established religion of humanity.

   There is such a thing as Divine irony. It is used with great effect
   when Elijah confronts the priests of Baal. So, here, the priests of
   Baal are once more to be met; and they are challenged with their own
   weapons.

   When Jehovah was about to interfere on His people's behalf, and
   accomplish their deliverance from the tyranny of Pharaoh, He spake thus
   to Moses, that not only man and beast should suffer, but "against all
   the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I AM JEHOVAH" (Exodus xii.
   12). It will be seen that every plague what was sent pointed to some
   characteristic quality or attribute supposed to belong to their gods,
   or to prove their impotence in what they professed to control.

   This but foreshadows the days in which John was to prophesy. When
   established religion will be set up in a more blasphemous and defiant
   form, it will not only be the worship of demons -- gods -- and departed
   heroes; but also a living MAN who shall declare that he is GOD; at the
   same time blaspheming the God of Heaven. Then it is that we see the
   very weapons of their false philosophy turned against the foe to their
   eternal shame.

   God graciously gave to Moses the evidence of the power He was about to
   delegate to him and also to Aaron in the first sign before they went
   into Pharaoh, when the rod which was cast on the ground became a
   serpent.

   This is a well-recognised performance of all magicians to the present
   day. When they both went into Pharaoh with the magicians, every man's
   rod did the same, but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. To the King
   it was but the performance of another magician. This is an instance of
   the very weapons of the magicians' art being used against them. In the
   case of the sixth plague it is equally evident, for according to Gleig
   quoted in The Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation, "there were several
   altars upon which human sacrifices were occasionally offered when they
   desired to propitiate Typhon (the Serpent), the Evil Principle." The
   victims were burned, their ashes gathered, and the priests cast them
   into the air in order that evil might be averted from every place to
   which they were wafted. Moses does the same; but affliction followed to
   King and people.

   Then follows a blow against the worship of Osiris and Isis -- the Sun
   and the Moon -- who were supposed to control the elements. Jehovah
   strikes a blow against such wicked pretensions, and for three days the
   place is wrapped in "darkness that might be felt," and in this way God
   again asserted His supremacy.

   The great blow of all was reserved for the last. The worship of the
   Sun-God was the prevailing worship of Egypt, and human sacrifice was
   followed in its ritual.

   "The sacrifice of the firstborn in honour of the Sun-god (Osiris) was
   one of the most notorious rites of the ancient Semitic worship. The
   first month of the year, and the first sign of the Zodiac referred to
   this sacrifice, called 'the Sacrifice of Bel.' It is to Accad, and not
   to Phoenicia, that we must look for the origin of human sacrifice in
   Western Asia. This inference is verified by two cuneiform texts in
   which mention is made of human sacrifice. We have clear indications in
   these of the sacrifice of children, such as took place in Carthage, in
   Phoenicia, and in Palestine -- also in the British Isles" (Trans. Bib.
   Arch., iv., p. 25, taken from Trans. Victoria Inst., xiv. p. 113).

   This was the last and most staggering blow at their idolatry. This
   final plague brought down their whole system of religion at one blow,
   convincing both Pharaoh and the Egyptians that they had to deal with
   one who was above all gods, and declared his name, "I AM JEHOVAH."

   This review of Israel's history in their beginnings prepares us to look
   for the same analogies in their future deliverance which the Book of
   Revelation records, the circumstances being in a very large measure
   parallel; Idolatry, as we have stated, being restored and established
   as the "religion of humanity." This shows why there is a very great
   similarity between the plagues of the one and the judgments of the
   other.

   We have before us a book of 800 pages, in which the writer labours to
   prove that in this Revelation we have nothing more than an imitation of
   the mysteries or the revelations of Ceres. But as paganism will be
   again revived, and demon gods worshipped, and a greater than Pharaoh
   dispute God's title to deliver His people, the same procedure is
   adopted as when He fist brought them out of Egypt, and blow follows
   blow, growing in intensity, and the very ceremonies observed common to
   initiation.

   Yea, with greater blows, and with judgments of greater intensity, will
   Jehovah assert His glory and His power. See Ex. xxxiv. 10.

   Extract from The Origin of Pagan Idolatry, by the Rev. George Stanley
   Faber, B.D., book vi. pp. 642 and 643:--

   "The whole machinery of the Apocalypse, from beginning to end, seems to
   me very plainly to have been borrowed from the machinery of the ancient
   Mysteries: and this, if we consider the nature of the subject, was done
   with the very strictest attention to poetical decorum.

   "St. John himself is made to personate an aspirant about to be
   initiated: and, accordingly, the images presented to his mind's eye
   closely resemble the pageants of the Mysteries, both in nature, and in
   order of succession.

   "The prophet first beholds a door opened in the magnificent temple of
   heaven: and into this he is invited to enter by the voice of one, who
   plays the hierophant. Here he witnesses the unsealing of a sacred book:
   and forthwith he is appalled by a troop of ghastly apparitions, which
   flit in horrid succession before his eyes.

   "Among these are pre-eminently conspicuous a vast serpent, the
   well-known symbol of the great father; and two portentous wild beasts,
   which severally come up out of the sea and out of the earth.

   "Such hideous figures correspond with the canine phantoms of the Orgies
   which seemed to rise out of the ground, and with the polymorphic images
   of the principal hero-god who was universally deemed the offspring of
   the sea.

   "Passing these terrific monsters in safety, the prophet, constantly
   attended by his angel-heirophant who acts the part of an interpreter,
   is conducted into the presence of a female, who is described as closely
   resembling the great mother of pagan theology.

   "Like Isis, emerging from the sea and exhibiting herself to the eyes of
   the aspirant Apuleius, this female divinity, upborne upon the marine
   wild-beast, appears to float upon the surface of many waters. She is
   said to be an open and systematical harlot; just as the mother was the
   declared female principle of the fecundity, and she was also
   propitiated by literal fornication reduced to a religious system: and,
   as the initiated were made to drink a prepared liquor out of a sacred
   goblet; so this harlot is represented as intoxicating the kings of the
   earth with the golden cup of her prostitution.

   "On her forehead the very name of MYSTERY is inscribed: and the label
   teaches us that, in point of character, she is the great universal
   mother of idolatry.

   "The nature of this Mystery the officiating hierophant undertakes to
   explain: and an important prophecy is most curiously and artfully
   veiled under the very language and imagery of the Orgies. To the
   sea-born great father was ascribed a three-fold state; he lived, he
   died, and he revived: and these changes of condition were duly
   exhibited in the Mysteries.

   "To the sea-born wild beast is similarly ascribed a three-fold state;
   he lives, he dies, and he revives. While dead, he flies floating on the
   mighty ocean, just like Horus or Osirus or Siva or Vishnou: when he
   revives, again like those kindred deities, he emerges from the waves:
   and, whether dead or alive, he bears seven heads and ten horns,
   corresponding in number with the seven ark-preserved Rishis and the ten
   aboriginal patriarchs.

   "Nor is this all: as the worshippers of the great father bore his
   special mark or stigma, and were distinguished by his name; so the
   worshippers of the maritime beast bear his mark, and are equally
   decorated by his appellation.

   "At length, however, the first or doleful part of these sacred
   Mysteries draws to a close, and the last or joyful part is rapidly
   approaching. After the prophet has beheld the enemies of God plunged
   into a dreadful lake or inundation of liquid fire, which corresponds
   with the infernal lake or deluge of the Orgies, he is introduced into a
   splendidly illuminated region, expressly adorned with the
   characteristics of that Paradise which was the ultimate scope of the
   ancient aspirants: while, without the holy gate of admission, are the
   whole multitude of the profane, dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and
   murderers and idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

   "The comparison might have been drawn out to a greater length; but
   these hints may suffice."

   He also remarks that:

   "in the celebration of the mysteries, things were scenically and
   therefore literally exhibited" (Faber p. 149, vol. iii.).

   One great fact is clearly established -- for it was not many years
   after the writing of the Apocalypse, in the early centuries, that this
   book was discredited by the Fathers.

   Jerome says that the Greek churches rejected it. When it first appeared
   it was not only attacked by the Eastern Christians, but, according to
   them, victoriously refuted: and it was looked upon by them as being at
   the best an obscure and bad poem on the SUN in spring. (Epist. xcciii.
   ad. Dard, quoted from Mankind: their Origin and Destiny, p. 511).

   This is taken from a work, the purpose of which is to prove that the
   Apocalypse is not a Divine Revelation at all. Many have arrived at this
   conclusion besides this author; that not only this book, but that the
   whole Bible is written and constructed from the mysteries of Paganism.
   Even that excellent and reverent writer (Mr. Faber) asserts that the
   Apostle John used the ideas and phraseology of the mysteries, the basis
   of them being Serpent and SUN worship with the host of heaven.

   "Occulus, who was a pupil of Pythagoras, says, 'The universe considered
   as a whole, displays nothing to us which betrays a commencement, or
   which foretells destruction; no one has seen it created, or increased,
   or improved, or deteriorated, or decreased; it is ever the same,
   existing in the same way, always equal, or similar to itself!' " (cap.
   i. para. 6, Origin and Destiny, p. 394).

   Further evidence is forthcoming to show that there was design in the
   figuration of the Constellations. This is from the Babylonian tablets
   known as the Creation Legend. It states that "some divine personage
   prepared the mansions... He fixed the stars. Even the Lumasi" (which
   word Prof. Sayce translates as meaning 'the Sheep of the Hero,' the
   Hero being the Sun). The conclusion arrived at is that the divine
   arranger fixed the constellations for each of the twelve months. (See
   Primitive Constellations, Robert Brown, Junr., vol. ii. p. 1, 1900).

   An interesting account is also given of a recent scene on the
   Euphrates. It is called a prayer meeting of Star worshippers. The
   writer says that "to the number of about four thousand they still
   survive in their native land, principally along the banks of the
   Euphrates. They call themselves Mandaites, possessors of the 'Word,'
   the 'LIVING WORD.' " [458]

   They erect their "MISHKNA" or tabernacle. "Towards midnight the Star
   worshippers, men and women, come slowly down to the Mishkna by the
   riverside... a signal is given, and a procession of priests moves to
   the Mishkna. One 'deacon' holds aloft the large wooden tau-cross... The
   sacred book SIDRA RABBA is laid upon the altar, folded back where the
   liturgy of the living is divided from the ritual of the dead. The high
   priest takes a live pigeon," extends his hands towards the polar star,
   upon which he fixes his eyes, and lets the bird fly, calling aloud, "In
   the name of the living one, blessed be the primitive light, the ancient
   light, the Divinity self-created" (Ibid., pp. 177-8).

   "...Here, as so frequently, terrestrial ritual is based upon, and is a
   'pattern' of 'things in the heaven.' " (Ibid., p. 185).

   "The stars near the Centaur permitted the introduction of a further
   figure, the Wild-beast, which, originally forming part of the
   constellation, showed the triumph of the Sun-god over the Beast of
   darkness, and over his own solar Lion" (p. 241).

   "... Such then were the principles which obtained in the formation of
   the primitive constellations. Religious and mythological ideas, already
   long current and venerated, were stamped upon the sky as sacred and
   celestial forms."

   "... The system so formulated in the Euphrates valley was accepted and
   adopted in Western Asia. The constellations of Israelite and Phoenecian
   were those of Babylonian and Assyrian, even as Bel reappeared as Baal,
   and Istar as Ashtoreth" (Ibid., pp. 240-2).

   "The southern heavens are a reduplication of the northern, and regarded
   as the watery region. In this region is Cetus, which tries to devour
   the child of the woman" (R. Brown, Junr., Law of Cosmic Order,
   Astrology in Apocalypse, p. 81).

   "He casts forth a river, it is there on the planisphere. It flows down
   below the horizon into the underworld. This Cetus is the beast rising
   out of the sea.

   "The Beast upon whom sits the woman is Babylon."

   "In the planisphere she sits upon Hydra, the seven or many headed
   dragon, which issues from the Crater or Chaos. All the fowls were
   filled with her flesh. This is the crow devouring the Hydra" (p. 91).

   "The Tribes were considered parallel to the Zodiacal signs" (p. 113).

   "The Apocalypse is a magnificent dream of the final triumph of Christ
   over Antichrist, a glorious vision of the moral cosmos of God's world,
   wrought out in conflict with Anarchy, and practically a warning and a
   consolation to the people of God in the time of their persecution" (p.
   92).

   Mr. Maunder refers to a great astronomical revolution that took place
   subsequent to the first naming of the signs. "Five thousand years ago,
   the Zodiac was planned, with the Bull of Taurus for its leader. Aries
   was then the last and least important of the twelve. The next view that
   we get of the state of Astronomy is some 2,000 years later. The Ram of
   Aries is now the prince of the Zodiac, Taurus has dropped to a second
   place, and the Zodiac itself has suffered an important change... How
   that revolution came about we have at present no means of knowing; but
   it has hitherto interposed a great barrier to our learning either from
   classical literature or from myths or monuments, anything trustworthy
   as to the true origin of the constellations, for the reason that the
   sources we have been consulting are, in consequence of that revolution,
   as ignorant of the matter as ourselves..." (XIX. Century, Sep., 1900,
   No. 283, p. 459. Article, "The Oldest Picture Book of All").

   All this evidence goes to show that there is more than meets the eye in
   this wonderful Book.

   To the unenlightened reader there is much that is meaningless. But when
   we consider the grand scope of the Apocalypse we can understand why it
   should look backward to the beginning and onward to the end; writing
   folly on man's perversion of primitive truth, smiting with judgment
   those who will attempt to revive it; and showing that the God of heaven
   is high over the gods of the heathen. They will be unable to protect
   their worshippers when the living God shall arise to shake terribly the
   earth.
