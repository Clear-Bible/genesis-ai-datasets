     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I

   To my fellow-presbyter Timothy, Dionysius the Presbyter

   That every divine illumination, while going forth with love in various
   ways to the objects of its forethought, remains one. Nor is this all:
   it also unifies the things illuminated.

   Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down
   from the Father of Lights.' [James 1:17]

   Moreover, every divine procession of radiance from the Father, while
   constantly bounteously flowing to us, fills us anew as though with a
   unifying power, by recalling us to things above, and leading us to the
   unity of the Shepherding Father and to the Divine One. For from Him and
   into Him are all things, as is written in the holy Word.

   Calling then upon Jesus, the Light of the Father, the Real and True,
   Which lights every man that comes into the world, by whom we have
   access to the Father,' the Origin of Light, let us raise our thought,
   according to our power, to the illumination of the most sacred
   doctrines handed down by the Fathers, and also as far as we may let us
   contemplate the Hierarchies of the Celestial Intelligences revealed to
   us by them in symbols for our upliftment:

   and admitting through the spiritual and unwavering eyes of the mind the
   original and super-original gift of Light of the Father who is the
   Source of Divinity, which shows to us images of the all-blessed
   Hierarchies of the Angels in figurative symbols, let us through them
   again strive upwards toward Its primal ray. For this Light can never be
   deprived of Its own intrinsic unity, and although in goodness It
   becomes manyness and proceeds into manifestation for the uplifting of
   those creatures governed by Its providence, yet It abides eternally
   within Itself in changeless sameness, firmly established in Its own
   unity, and elevates to Itself, according to their capacity, those who
   turn towards It, uniting them in accordance with Its own unity. For by
   that first divine ray we can be enlighted only insofar as It is hidden
   by all-various holy veils for our upliftment, and fittingly tempered to
   our natures by the Providence of the Father.

   Wherefore that first institution of the sacred rites, judging it worthy
   of a supermundane copy of the Celestial Hierarchies, gave us our most
   holy hierarchy, and described that spiritual Hierarchy in material
   terms and in various compositions of forms so that we might be led,
   each according to his capacity, from the most holy imagery to formless,
   unific, elevative principles and assimilations. For the mind can by no
   means be directed to the spiritual presentation and contemplation of
   the Celestial Hierarchies unless it use the material guidance suited to
   it, accounting those beauties which are seen to be images of the hidden
   beauty, the sweet incense a symbol of spiritual dispensations, and the
   earthly lights a figure of the immaterial enlightenment. Similarly the
   details of the sacred teaching correspond to the feast of contemplation
   in the soul, while the ranks of order on earth reflect the Divine
   Concord and the disposition of the Heavenly Orders. The receiving of
   the most holy Eucharist symbolizes our participation of Jesus; and
   everything else delivered in a supermundane manner to Celestial Natures
   is given to us in symbols.

   To further, then, the attainment of our due measure of deification, the
   loving Source of all mysteries, in showing to us the Celestial
   Hierarchies, and consecrating our hierarchy as fellowministers,
   according to our capacity, in the likeness of their divine ministry,
   depicted those supercelestial Intelligences in material images in the
   inspired writings of the sacred Word so that we might be guided through
   the sensible to the intelligible, and from sacred symbols to the Primal
   Source of the Celestial Hierarchies.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

   That Divine and Celestial matters are fittingly revealed even through
   unlike symbols

   I consider, then, that in the first place we must explain our
   conception of the purpose of each Hierarchy and the good conferred by
   each upon its followers; secondly we must celebrate the Celestial
   Hierarchies as they are revealed in the Scriptures; and finally we must
   say under what holy figures the descriptions in the sacred writings
   portray those Celestial Orders, and to what kind of purity we ought to
   be guided through those forms lest we, like the many, should impiously
   suppose that those Celestial and Divine Intelligences are many-footed
   or many-faced beings, or formed with the brutishness of oxen, or the
   savageness of lions, or the curved beaks of eagles, or the feathers of
   birds, or should imagine that they are some kind of fiery wheels above
   the heavens, or material thrones upon which the Supreme Deity may
   recline, or many-coloured horses, or commanders of armies, or whatever
   else of symbolic description has been given to us in the various sacred
   images of the Scriptures. Theology, in its sacred utterances concerning
   the formless Intelligences, does indeed use poetic symbolism, having
   regard to our intelligence, as has been said, and providing a means of
   ascent fitting and natural to it by framing the sacred Scriptures in a
   manner designed for our upliftment.

   An image of angels

   Angel With Moon, from 12th c. Greek ms.

   But someone may prefer to regard the Divine Orders as pure and
   ineffable in their own natures, and beyond our power of vision, and may
   consider that the imagery of the Celestial Intelligences in the
   Scriptures does not really represent them, and is like a crude
   dramatization of the celestial names: and he may say that the
   theologians, in depicting wholly incorporeal natures under bodily forms
   should, as far as possible, make use of fitting and related images, and
   represent them by the most exalted, incorporeal and spiritual
   substances amongst ourselves, and should not endue the Celestial and
   Godlike Principles with a multitude of low and earthly forms. For the
   one would contribute in a higher degree to our ascent by dissociating
   incongruous images from the descriptions of Supermundane Natures, while
   the other impiously outrages the Divine Powers, and leads our minds
   into error when we dwell upon such unholy compositions. For we might
   even think that the supercelestial regions are filled with herds of
   lions and horses, and re-echo with roaring songs of praise, and contain
   flocks of birds and other creatures, and the lower forms of matter, and
   whatever other absurd, spurious, passion-arousing and unlike forms the
   Scriptures use in describing their resemblances.

   Nevertheless, I think that the investigation of the truth shows the
   most holy wisdom of the Scriptures in the representations of the
   Celestial Intelligences which makes the most perfect provision in each
   case, so that neither is dishonour done to the Divine Powers (as they
   may be called), nor are we bound more passionately to earth by the
   meanness and baseness of the images. For it might be said that the
   reason for attributing shapes to that which is above shape, and forms
   to that which is beyond form, is not only the feebleness of our
   intellectual power which is unable to rise at once to spiritual
   contemplation, and which needs to be encouraged by the natural and
   suitable support and upliftment which offers us forms perceptible to us
   of formless and supernatural contemplations, but it is also because it
   is most fitting that the secret doctrines, through ineffable and holy
   enigmas, should veil and render difficult of access for the multitude
   the sublime and profound truth of the supernatural Intelligences. For,
   as the Scripture declares, not everyone is holy, nor have all men
   knowledge.

   Again, if anyone condemns these representations as incongruous,
   suggesting that it is disgraceful to fashion such base images of the
   divine and most holy Orders, it is sufficient to answer that the most
   holy Mysteries are set forth in two modes: one, by means of similar and
   sacred representations akin to their nature, and the other through
   unlike forms designed with every possible discordance and difference.
   For example, the mystical traditions of the enlightening Word sometimes
   celebrate the Sublime Blessedness of the Superessential ONE as Word,
   and Wisdom, and Essence; proclaiming the Intellect and Wisdom of God
   both essentially, as the Source of being, and also as the true Cause of
   existence; and they make It equivalent to Light, and call It Life.

   Now although such sacred forms are more venerable, and seem in one
   sense to surpass the material presentation, even so they fail to
   express truly the Divine Likeness which verily transcends all essence
   and life, and which no light can fully represent; for an other word and
   wisdom is incomparably below It. But at other times It is extolled in a
   supermundane manner in the same writings, where It is named Invisible,
   Infinite and Unbounded, in such terms as indicate not what It is, but
   what It is not: for this, in my judgment, is more in accord with Its
   nature, since, as the Mysteries and the priestly tradition suggested,
   we are right in saying that It is not in the likeness of any created
   thing, and we cannot comprehend Its superessential, invisible and
   ineffable Infinity. If, therefore, the negations in the descriptions of
   the Divine are true, and the affirmations are inconsistent with It, the
   exposition of the hidden Mysteries by the use of unlike symbols accords
   more closely with That which is ineffable.

   Accordingly this mode of description in the holy writings honours,
   rather than dishonours, the Holy and Celestial Orders by revealing them
   in unlike images, manifesting through these their supernal excellence,
   far beyond all mundane things. Nor, I suppose, will any reasonable man
   deny that discordant figures uplift the mind more than do the
   harmonious, for in dwelling upon the nobler images, it is probable that
   we might fall into the error of supposing that the Celestial
   Intelligences are some kind of golden beings, or shining men flashing
   like lightning, fair to behold, or clad in glittering apparel, raying
   forth harmless fire, or with such other similar forms as are assigned
   by theology to the Celestial Intelligences. But lest this thing befall
   those whose mind has conceived nothing higher than the wonders of
   visible beauty, the wisdom of the venerable theologists, which has
   power to lead us to the heights, reverently descends to the level of
   the inharmonious dissimilitudes, not allowing our irrational nature to
   remain attached to those unseemly images, but arousing the
   upward-turning part of the soul, and stimulating it through the
   ugliness of the images; since it would seem neither right nor true,
   even to those who cling to earthly things, that such low forms could
   resemble those supercelestial and divine contemplations. Moreover, it
   must be borne in mind that no single existing thing is entirely
   deprived of participation in the Beautiful, for, as the true Word says,
   all things are very beautiful.

   Holy contemplations can therefore be derived from all things, and the
   above-named incongruous similitudes can be fashioned from material
   things to symbolize that which is intelligible and intellectual, since
   the intellectual has in another manner what has been attributed
   differently to the perceptible. For instance, passion in irrational
   creatures arises from the impulse of appetency, and their passion is
   full of all irrationality; but it is otherwise with intellectual beings
   in whom the energy of passion must be regarded as denoting their
   masculine reason and unwavering steadfastness, established in the
   changeless heavenly places. In the same manner, by desire in irrational
   creatures we mean the instinctual innate tendency towards temporal
   materials things, or the uncontrolled inborn appetites of mutable
   creatures, and the dominating irrational desires of the body which urge
   the whole creature towards that for which the senses crave.

   An image of angels

   But when, using unlike images, we speak of desire in connection with
   Intellectual Beings we must understand by this a divine love of the
   Immaterial, above reason and mind, and an enduring and unshakable
   superessential longing for pure and passionless contemplation, and
   true, sempiternal, intelligible participation in the most sublime and
   purest Light, and in the eternal and most perfect Beauty. And
   incontinence we must understand as that which is intense and unswerving
   and irresistible because of its pure and steadfast love of the Divine
   Beauty, and the undeviating urge towards That which most truly is to be
   desired.

   In the case of the irrational or the insensitive things, such as brutes
   among living creatures, or inanimate objects, we rightly say that these
   are deprived of reason, or of sense-perception. But we fittingly
   proclaim the sovereignty, as Supermundane Beings, of the immaterial and
   intellectual Natures over our discursive and corporeal reasoning and
   sense-perceptions, which are remote from those Divine Intelligences.

   It is therefore lawful to portray Celestial Beings in forms drawn from
   even the lowest of material things which are not discordant since they,
   too, having originated from That which is truly beautiful, have
   throughout the whole of their bodily constitution some vestiges of
   Intellectual Beauty, and through these we may be led to immaterial
   Archetypes; the similitudes being taken, as has been said,
   dissimilarly, and the same things being defined, not in the same way,
   but harmoniously and fittingly, in the case both of intellectual and
   sensible natures.

   We shall see that the theologians mystically employ symbolical
   explanations not only in the case of the Celestial Orders, but even for
   the presentation of the Deific Principles themselves. And sometimes
   they celebrate Deity Itself with lofty symbolism as the Sun of justice,
   as the Morning Star rising mystically in the mind, or as Light shining
   forth unclouded and intelligibly; and sometimes they use images of
   things on earth, such as fire flashing forth with harmless flame, or
   water affording abundance of life symbolically flowing into a belly and
   gushing out in perpetually overflowing rivers and streams.

   The lowest images are also used, such as fragrant ointment, or the
   corner-stone, and they even give It the forms of wild animals and liken
   It to the lion and panther, or name It a leopard, or a raging bear
   bereaved of its young. I will add, furthermore, that which appears most
   base and unseemly of all, namely that some renowned theologians have
   represented It as assuming the form of a worm. Thus all those who are
   wise in divine matters, and are interpreters of the mystical
   revelations, set apart in purity the Holy of Holies from the
   uninitiated and unpurified, and prefer incongruous symbols for holy
   things, so that divine things may not be easily accessible to the
   unworthy, nor may those who earnestly contemplate the divine symbols
   dwell upon the forms themselves as the final truth. Therefore we may
   celebrate the Divine Natures through the truest negations and also by
   the images of the lowest things in contrast with their own Likeness.
   Hence there is no absurdity in portraying the Celestial Natures, for
   the reasons mentioned, by discordant and diverse symbols: for possibly
   we ourselves might not have begun to search into the Mysteries which
   lead us to the Heights through the careful examinations of the holy
   Word, had not the ugliness of the imagery of the Angels startled us,
   not suffering our mind to dwell upon the discordant figures, but
   stimulating it to leave behind all material attachments, and training
   it by means of that which is apparent to aspire devoutly to the
   supermundane ascent.

   Let these things suffice touching the corporeal and inharmonious forms
   used for the delineation of Angels in the sacred Scriptures. We must
   proceed to the definition of our conception of the Hierarchy itself,
   and of the blessings which are enjoyed by those who participate in it.
   But let our leader in the discourse be my Christ (if thus I dare name
   Him) who inspires all hierarchical revelation. And do thou, my son,
   listen, according to the law of our hierarchical tradition, with meet
   reverence to that which is reverently set forth, becoming through
   instruction inspired by the revelations; and, treasuring deep in the
   soul the holy Mysteries, preserve them in their unity from the
   unpurified multitude: for, as the Scriptures declare, it is not fitting
   to cast before swine that pure and beautifying and clear-shining glory
   of the intelligible pearls.

CHAPTER III

   What is Hierarchy, and what the use of Hierarchy?

   Hierarchy is, in my opinion, a holy order and knowledge and activity
   which, so far as is attainable, participates in the Divine Likeness,
   and is lifted up to the illuminations given it from God, and
   correspondingly towards the imitation of God.

   Now the Beauty of God, being unific, good, and the Source of all
   perfection, is wholly free from dissimilarity, and bestows its own
   Light upon each according to his merit;* and in the most divine
   Mysteries perfects them in accordance with the unchangeable fashioning
   of those who are being perfected harmoniously to Itself.

   The aim of Hierarchy is the greatest possible assimilation to and union
   with God, and by taking Him as leader in all holy wisdom, to become
   like Him, so far as is permitted, by contemplating intently His most
   Divine Beauty. Also it moulds and perfects its participants in the holy
   image of God like bright and spotless mirrors which receive the Ray of
   the Supreme Deity -- which is the Source of Light; and being mystically
   filled with the Gift of Light, it pours it forth again abundantly,
   according to the Divine Law, upon those below itself. For it is not
   lawful for those who impart or participate in the holy Mysteries to
   overpass the bounds of its sacred laws; nor must they deviate from them
   if they seek to behold, as far as is allowed, that Deific Splendour and
   to be transformed into the likeness of those Divine Intelligences.

   Therefore he who speaks of Hierarchy implies a certain perfectly holy
   Order in the likeness of the First Divine Beauty, ministering the
   sacred mystery of its own illuminations in hierarchical order and
   wisdom, being in due measure conformed to its own Principle. [1]

   For each of those who is allotted a place in the Divine Order finds his
   perfection in being uplifted, according to his capacity , towards the
   Divine Likeness; and what is still more divine, he becomes, as the
   Scriptures say, a fellow-worker with God, and shows forth the Divine
   Activity revealed as far as possible in himself. For the holy
   constitution of the Hierarchy ordains that some are purified, others
   purify; some are enlightened, others enlighten; some are perfected,
   others make perfect; for in this way the divine imitation will fit each
   one.

   Inasmuch as the Divine Bliss (to speak in human terms) is exempt from
   all dissimilarity, and is full of Eternal Light, perfect, in need of no
   perfection, purifying, illuminating, perfecting being rather Himself
   the holy Purification, Illumination and Perfection, above purification,
   above light. supremely perfect, Himself the origin of perfection and
   the cause of every Hierarchy, He transcends in excellence all holiness.
   [2]

   I hold, therefore, that those who are being purified ought to be wholly
   perfected and free from all taint of unlikeness; those who are
   illuminated should be filled full with Divine Light, ascending, to the
   contemplative state and power with the most pure eyes of the mind;
   those who are being initiated, holding themselves apart from all
   imperfection, should become participators in the Divine Wisdom which
   they have contemplated.

   Further it is meet that those who purify should bestow upon others from
   their abundance of purity their own holiness: those who illuminate, as
   possessing more luminous intelligence, duly receiving and again
   shedding forth the light, and joyously filled with holy brightness,
   should impart their own overflowing light to those worthy of it;
   finally, those who make perfect, being skilled in the mystical
   participations, should lead to that consummation those who are
   perfected by the most holy initiation of the knowledge of holy things
   which they have contemplated.

   Thus each order in the hierarchical succession is guided to the divine
   co-operation, and brings into manifestation, through the Grace and
   Power of God, that which is naturally and supernaturally in the
   Godhead, and which is consummated by Him superessentially, but is
   hierarchically manifested for man's imitation as far as is attainable,
   of the God-loving Celestial Intelligences.

   [1] A chain likewise extends from on high, as far as to the last of
   things, secondary natures always expressing the powers of the natures
   prior to them, progression indeed diminishing the similitude, but all
   things at the same time, and even such as most obscurely participate of
   existence, bearing a similitude to the first causes, and being
   co-passive with each other and with their original causes.'--Proclus,
   Theology of Plato, VI.4

   [2] For everything which is converted hastens to be conjoined with its
   cause and aspires after communion with it'--Proposition XXXII. Proclus,
   Metaphysical Elements. The soul ought first to examine its own nature,
   to know whether it has the faculty of contemplating spiritual things,
   and whether it has indeed an eye wherewith to see them, and if it ought
   to embark on the quest. If the spiritual is foreign to it, what is the
   use of trying? But if there is a relationship between us and it, we
   both can and ought to find it.' Plotinus, Ennead, V. 1-3.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IV

   The meaning of the name Angels'.

   Since, in my opinion, the nature of a hierarchy has been adequately
   defined, we must proceed to render honour to the Angelic Hierarchy,
   intently gazing with supermundane sight upon the holy imagery of it in
   the Scriptures, that we may be uplifted in the highest degree to their
   divine purity through that mystical representation, and may praise the
   Origin of all hierarchical knowledge with a veneration worthy of the
   things of God, and with devout thanksgiving.

   In the first place this truth must be declared, that the superessential
   Deity, having through His Goodness established the essential
   subsistence of all, brought all things into being. For it is the very
   nature of that God which is the Supreme Cause of all to call all things
   to participation in Itself in proportion to the capacity and nature of
   each.

   Wherefore all things share in that Providence which streams forth from
   the superessential Deific Source of all; for they would not be unless
   they had come into existence through participation in the Essential
   Principle of all things.

   All inanimate things participate in It through their being; for the to
   be' of all things is the Divinity above Being Itself, the true Life.
   Living things participate in Its life-giving Power above all life;
   rational things participate in Its self-perfect and pre-eminently
   perfect Wisdom above all reason and intellect.

   It is manifest, therefore, that those Natures which are around the
   Godhead have participated of It in manifold ways. On this account the
   holy ranks of the Celestial Beings are present with and participate in
   the Divine Principle in a degree far surpassing all those things which
   merely exist, and irrational living creatures, and rational human
   beings. For moulding themselves intelligibly to the imitation of God,
   and looking in a supermundane way to the Likeness of the Supreme Deity,
   and longing to form the intellectual appearance of It, they naturally
   have more abundant communion with Him, and with unremitting activity
   they tend eternally up the steep, as far as is permitted, through the
   ardour of their unwearying divine love, and they receive the Primal
   Radiance in a pure and immaterial manner, adapting themselves to this
   in a life wholly intellectual.

   Such, therefore, are they who participate first, and in an all-various
   manner, in Deity, and reveal first, and in many ways, the Divine
   Mysteries. Wherefore they, above all, are pre-eminently worthy of the
   name Angel because they first receive the Divine Light, and through
   them are transmitted to us the revelations which are above us.

   It is thus that the Law (as it is written in the Scriptures) was given
   to us by Angels and, both before and after the days of the Law, Angels
   guided our illustrious forefathers to God, either by declaring to them
   what they should do and leading them from error and an evil life to the
   straight path of truth, or by making known to them the Divine Law, or
   in the manner of interpreters, by showing to them holy Hierarchies, or
   secret visions of supermundane Mysteries, or certain divine prophecies.

   Now, if anyone should say that God has shown Himself without
   intermediary to certain holy men, let him know beyond doubt, from the
   most holy Scriptures, that no man has ever seen, nor shall see, the
   hidden Being of God; but God has shown Himself, according to
   revelations which are fitting to God, to His faithful servants in holy
   visions adapted to the nature of the seer.

   The divine theology, in the fullness of its wisdom, very rightly
   applies the name theophany to that beholding of God which shows the
   Divine Likeness, figured in Itself as a likeness in form of That which
   is formless, through the uplifting of those who contemplate to the
   Divine; inasmuch as a Divine Light is shed upon the seers through it,
   and they are initiated into some participation of divine things.

   By such divine visions our venerable forefathers were instructed
   through the mediation of the Celestial Powers. Is it not told in the
   holy Scriptures that the sacred Law was given to Moses by God Himself
   in order to teach us that in it is mirrored the divine and holy Law?
   Furthermore, theology wisely teaches that it was communicated to us by
   Angels, as though the authority of the Divine Law decreed that the
   second should be guided to the Divine Majesty by the first. For not
   solely in the case of higher and lower natures, but also for
   co-ordinate natures, this Law has been established by its
   superessential original Author: that within each Hierarchy there are
   first, middle and last ranks and powers, and that the higher are
   initiators and guides of the lower to the divine approach and
   illumination and union. [3]

   I see that the Angels, too, were first initiated into the divine
   Mystery, of Jesus in His love for man, and through them the gift of
   that knowledge was bestowed upon us: for the divine Gabriel announced
   to Zachariah the high-priest that the son who should to born to him
   through Divine Grace, when he was bereft of hope, would be a prophet of
   that Jesus who would manifest the union of the human and divine natures
   through the ordinance of the Good Law for the salvation of the world;
   and he revealed to Mary how of her should be born the Divine Mystery of
   the ineffable Incarnation of God.

   Another Angel taught Joseph that the divine promise made to his
   forefather David should be perfectly fulfilled. Another brought to the
   shepherds the glad tidings, as to those purified by quiet withdrawal
   from the many, and with him a multitude of the heavenly host gave forth
   to all the dwellers upon earth our often-sung hymn of adoring praise.

   Let us now mount upward to that most sublime of all Lights celebrated
   in the Scriptures: for I perceive that Jesus Himself who is the
   superessential Head of the supercelestial Beings above Nature, when
   taking our nature while still keeping His own immutable Divinity, did
   not turn away from the human order which He arranged and chose, but
   rather submitted Himself obediently to the commands given by God the
   Father through Angels, by whose ministrations the Father's decree
   touching the flight of His Son into Egypt and the return from Egypt
   into Judaea. was announced to Joseph. Moreover, through Angels we see
   Him subjecting Himself to the Father's will; for I will not recall to
   one who knows our sacred tradition the Angel who fortified Jesus, or
   even that Jesus Himself, because He came for the good work of our
   salvation to fulfil the law in its spiritual application, was called
   Angel of Good Counsel. For He Himself says, in the manner of a herald,
   that whatsoever He heard from the Father He announced unto us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] The progressions of beings, however, are completed through
   similitude. But the terminations of the higher orders are united to the
   beginnings of second orders. And one series and indissoluble order
   extends from on high through the surpassing goodness of the First Cause
   and His unified Power. For because indeed He is One He is the supplier
   of union; but because He is the Good He constitutes things similar to
   Him prior to such as are dissimilar. And thus all things are in
   continuity with each other. For if this continuity were broken there
   would not be union.'--Proclus, Theology of Plato, VI.11.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER V

   Why all the Celestial Beings in common are called Angels.

   This, so far as we understand it, is the reason for the name Angel in
   the Scriptures. Now I think we should investigate the reason why
   theologians give the general name Angels to all the Celestial Beings,
   but when explaining the characteristics of the supermundane Orders they
   specifically give the name Angel to those who complete and conclude the
   Divine Celestial Hierarchies. Above these they place the choirs of
   Archangels, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, and those other beings who
   are acknowledged by the traditional scriptural teachings to be of
   higher rank.

   Now we maintain that in these Hierarchies the higher Orders possess the
   illuminations and powers of the lower ranks, but the lower do not
   participate equally with those above them. Hence the theologians call
   the higher of these spiritual Orders Angels because they, too, show
   forth the Divine Radiance; but we can find no reason for calling the
   lowest choirs of the Celestial Intelligences Principalities or Thrones
   or Seraphim, for they do not manifest in the same degree that supremely
   excellent power; but just as they guide our inspired hierarchs to the
   Divine Brightness known to them, so do those most holy Powers which are
   above them lead to the Divine Majesty those ranks which complete the
   Angelic Hierarchies. [4]

   And this also may be added, that all can rightly be called Angels in
   respect of their participation in the Divine Likeness and Illumination
   both in the higher and lower ranks.

   But now let us proceed further into detail, and with singleness of mind
   examine the particular sacred characteristics of each of the Celestial
   Orders which are set forth for us in the Scriptures.

   [4] Everything which proceeds in the divine orders is not naturally
   adapted to receive all the powers of its producing cause. Not in short,
   are secondary natures able to receive all the powers of the natures
   prior to themselves, but the latter have certain powers exempt from
   things in in inferior order, and incomprehensible by the beings
   posterior to themselves.'--Proposition CL. Proclus, Metaphysical
   Elements.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

   Which is the first Order of the Celestial Beings, which the middle, and
   which the last?

   I hold that none but the Divine Creator by whom they were ordained is
   able to know fully the number and the nature of the supermundane Beings
   and the regulation of their sacred Hierarchies; and furthermore, that
   they know their own powers and illuminations and their own holy
   supermundane ordination. For we could not have known the mystery of
   these supercelestial Intelligences and all the holiness of their
   perfection had it not been taught to us by God through His Ministers
   who truly know their own natures.

   Therefore we will say nothing as from ourselves, but being instructed
   will set forth, according to our ability, those angelic visions which
   the venerable theologians have beheld.

   Theology has given to the Celestial Beings nine interpretative names,
   and among these our divine initiator distinguishes three threefold
   Orders. [5] In the first rank of all he places those who, as we are
   told, dwell eternally in the constant presence of God, and cleave to
   Him, and above all others are immediately united to Him. And he says
   that the teachings of the holy Word testify that the most holy Thrones
   and many-eyed and many-winged ones, named in the Hebrew tongue Cherubim
   and Seraphim, are established immediately about God and nearest to Him
   above all others. Our venerable hierarch describes this threefold Order
   as a co-equal unity, and truly the most exalted of the Hierarchies, the
   most fully Godlike, and the most closely and immediately united to the
   First Light of the Godhead.

   The second, he says, contains the Powers, Virtues and Dominions, and
   the last and lowest choirs of the Celestial Intelligences are called
   Angels, Archangels and Principalities.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] There are nine Orders of Angels, figures of the nine Archetypes in
   God; and each one obtains a name corresponding to the property in God
   which it exhibits.' Further, the Cherubim are those who may be called
   loving Wisdoms, as those first may be called wise Loves. For there is
   in each both love and wisdom. But in the first, inasmuch as they are
   nearer to God, the very Sun of Truth, this exists in a far greater
   degree. . . . Such then is the difference between these Orders: namely,
   that in the latter is knowledge proceeding from love; in the former is
   love proceeding from knowledge.' In the third rank are those who, from
   their unity, simplicity, constancy and firmness, are sometimes called
   Thrones, sometimes Seats; who' themselves also are wise and loving. But
   from their simplicity, they have the attributes of unity, power,
   strength, fortitude, steadfastness. Which very attributes the Cherubim
   and Seraphim also possess. . . . Steadfastness comes from simplicity,
   simplicity from purification. For when each object is purified back to
   its own simple nature, then, being uncompounded, it remains
   indissoluble through its unity. Whence it is clear that purification is
   assigned to the Thrones. Moreover, when a thing is purified, it is
   illumined, and after it is illumined, it is perfected. This last office
   is given to the Seraphs, the other to the Cherubs. Among them all, in
   every threefold manner, there is a striving with all their might to
   imitate God; who is Purification Itself, the Parent of unities; who is
   the very Illumination of those unities; who is lastly the very
   Perfection of the illuminated. Power cleanses, clear truth makes
   serene, finished love makes perfect.' Thus does God beam forth with
   firmness, wisdom and love in the Thrones, Cherubs and Seraphs, which
   threefold system of the Divine Ray goes forth, and causes that in the
   Powers, Virtues and Dominions there should be reflected His divine and
   firm Power, His wise Virtue and the most loving Dominion; and that the
   Trinity of God, coequal in Itself, should shine with softened lustre,
   filling now the second place under that first one.' Among all the
   Angels, from the higher ones even down to us, there is a mutual and
   alternate announcement proceeding from above; as they receive and
   deliver in turn what they announce in a marvellous and most beautiful
   order. Since among the Angels themselves there is an order of all
   ordinances after the pattern of the Order of all. . . . But every
   announcement is a receiving, informing, purifying, enlightening,
   perfecting and representing of the Divine Truth; the Light of which as
   it goes forth in order and shines upon all, so distinguishes and marks
   each object in a wonderful manner, that everything shines forth in it
   in its own proper quality, and stands out and appears in its own
   nature, with its individual powers and office, exhibiting in its own
   degree some perfection in God, in whom all perfection is in its
   highest; nay, rather, who is Himself the proper Perfection of every
   one, perfecting all things, in whom there is nothing perfect but
   Himself.' John Colet, Works, J.H. Lupton, ed., (London: G. Bell, 1869).
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

   Of the Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones, and their first Hierarchy.

   In accepting this order of the holy Hierarchies we affirm that the
   names of each of the Celestial Choirs expresses its own Godlike
   characteristic. We are told by Hebrew scholars that the holy name
   Seraphim means those who kindle or make hot', and Cherubim denotes
   abundance of knowledge or an outflowing of wisdom.* Reasonably,
   therefore, is this first Celestial Hierarchy administered by the most
   transcendent Natures, since it occupies a more exalted place than all
   the others, being immediately present with God; and because of its
   nearness, to it are brought the first revelations and perfections of
   God before the rest. Therefore they are named The Glowing Ones',
   Streams of Wisdom', Thrones', in illustration of their Divine Nature.

   The name Seraphim clearly indicates their ceaseless and eternal
   revolution about Divine Principles, their heat and keenness, the
   exuberance of their intense, perpetual, tireless activity, and their
   elevative and energetic assimilation of those below, kindling them and
   firing them to their own heat, and wholly purifying them by a burning
   and all-consuming flame; and by the unhidden, unquenchable, changeless,
   radiant and enlightening power, dispelling and destroying the shadows
   of darkness. The name Cherubim denotes their power of knowing and
   beholding God, their receptivity to the highest Gift of Light, their
   contemplation of the Beauty of the Godhead in Its First Manifestation,
   and that they are filled by participation in Divine Wisdom, and
   bounteously outpour to those below them from their own fount of wisdom.

   The name of the most glorious and exalted Thrones denotes that which is
   exempt from and untainted by any base and earthly thing, and the
   supermundane ascent up the steep. For these have no part in that which
   is lowest, but dwell in fullest power, immovably and perfectly
   established in the Most High, and receive the Divine Immanence above
   all passion and matter, and manifest God, being attentively open to
   divine participations.

   This, then, is the meaning of their names, so far as we understand it:
   but now we must set forth our conception of the nature of this
   Hierarchy, for the object of every Hierarchy, as I think we have
   already sufficiently shown, is a steadfast devotion to the divine
   assimilation in the Likeness of God; and the whole work of a Hierarchy
   is in the participation and the imparting of a most holy Purification,
   Divine Light and perfecting Knowledge.

   And now I pray that I may speak worthily of those most exalted
   Intelligences, and as their Hierarchy is revealed in the Scriptures. It
   is clear that the Hierarchy is similar in its nature and has close
   affinity with those First Beings who are established after the Godhead,
   which is the Source of their Being, as though within Its Portals,
   transcending all created powers, both visible and invisible. Therefore
   we must recognize that they are pure, not as having been cleansed from
   stains and defilements, nor as not admitting material images, but as
   far higher than all baseness, and surpassing all that is holy. As
   befits the highest purity, they are established above the most Godlike
   Powers and eternally keep their own self-motive and self-same order
   through the Eternal Love of God, never weakening in power, abiding most
   purely in their own Godlike identity, ever unshaken and unchanging.
   Again, they are contemplative, not as beholding intellectual or
   sensible symbols, nor as being uplifted to the Divine by the
   all-various contemplations set forth in the Scriptures, but as filled
   with Light higher than all immaterial knowledge, and rapt, as is meet,
   in the contemplation of that Beauty which is the superessential triune
   Origin and Creator of all beauty. In like manner they are thought
   worthy of fellowship with Jesus, not through sacred images which shadow
   forth the Divine Likeness, but as truly being close to Him in that
   first participation of the knowledge of His Deifying Illuminations.
   Moreover, the imitation of God is granted to them in a preeminent
   degree, and as far as their nature permits they share the divine and
   human virtues in primary power.

   In the same manner they are perfect, not as though enlightened by an
   analytical knowledge of holy variety, but because they are wholly
   perfected through the highest and most perfect deification, possessing
   the highest knowledge that Angels can have of the works of God; being
   Hierarchs not through other holy beings, but from God Himself, and
   since they are uplifted to God directly by their pre-eminent power and
   rank, they are both established immovably beside the All-Holy, and are
   borne up, as far as is allowable, to the contemplation of His
   Intelligible and Spiritual Beauty. Being placed nearest to God, they
   are instructed in the true understanding of the divine works, and
   receive their hierarchical order in the highest degree from Deity
   Itself, the First Principle of Perfection.

   The theologians therefore clearly show that the lower ranks of the
   Celestial Beings receive the understanding of the divine works from
   those above them in a fitting manner, and that the highest are
   correspondingly enlightened in the Divine Mysteries by the Most High
   God Himself. [6] For some of them are shown to us as enlightened in
   holy matters by those above them, and we learn that He who in human
   form ascended to heaven is Lord of the Celestial Powers and King of
   Glory. And Angels are represented as questioning Him and desiring
   knowledge of His divine redemptive work for us, and Jesus Himself is
   depicted as teaching them and revealing directly to them His great
   goodness towards mankind. For I, He says, speak righteousness and the
   judgment of salvation.' Moreover, I am astonished that even the first
   rank of Celestial Beings, so far surpassing all the others, should
   reverently desire to receive the divine enlightenment in an
   intermediate manner. For they do not ask directly, Wherefore are Thy
   garments red?' but first eagerly question one another, showing that
   they seek and long for the knowledge of His divine words, without
   expectation of the enlightenment divinely granted them.

   The first Hierarchy of the Celestial Intelligences, therefore, is
   purified and enlightened; being ordained by that First Perfecting
   Cause, uplifted directly to Himself, and filled, analogously, with the
   most holy purification of the boundless Light of the Supreme
   Perfection, untouched by any inferiority, full of Primal Light, and
   perfected by its union with the first-given Understanding and
   Knowledge.

   But to sum up, I may say, not unreasonably, that the participation in
   Divine Knowledge is a purification, an illumination and a perfection.
   For it purifies from ignorance by the knowledge of the perfect
   Mysteries granted in due measure; it illuminates through the Divine
   Knowledge Itself by which it purifies the mind which formerly did not
   behold that which is now shown to it by the higher illumination; and it
   perfects by the self-same light through the abiding knowledge of the
   most luminous initiations.

   This, so far as I know, is the first Order of Celestial Beings which
   are established about God, immediately encircling Him: and in perpetual
   purity they encompass His eternal Knowledge in that most high and
   eternal angelic dance, rapt in the bliss of manifold blessed
   contemplations, and irradiated with pure and primal splendours.

   The are filled with divine food which is manifold, through the
   first-given outpouring, yet one through the unvaried and unific oneness
   of the divine banquet; and they are deemed worthy of communion and
   co-operation with God by reason of their assimilation to Him, as far as
   is possible for them, in the excellence of their natures and energies.
   For they know pre-eminently many divine matters, and they participate
   as far as they may in Divine Understanding and Knowledge.

   Wherefore theology has given those on earth its hymns or praise in
   which is divinely shown forth the great excellence of its sublime
   illumination. For some of that choir (to use material terms) cry out as
   with a voice like the sound of many waters, Blessed is the Glory of the
   Lord from His Place'; others cry aloud that most renowned and sacred
   hymn of highest praise to God, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth,
   the whole earth is full of Thy Glory!'

   Now we have already expounded to the best of our ability in the
   treatise on Divine Hymns these most sublime hymns of the supercelestial
   Intelligences, and have sufficiently dealt with them there. For the
   present purpose it is enough to recall that this first Order, having
   been duly enlightened by the Divine Goodness in the knowledge of
   theology, gave to those below it, as befits angelic goodness, this
   teaching (to state it briefly) that it is meet that the most august
   Deity, above praise, and all-praised, worthy of the highest praise,
   should be known and proclaimed, as far as is attainable, by the
   God-filled Intelligences (for, as the Scriptures say, being in the
   Likeness of God, they are divine habitations of the Divine Stillness);
   and again, the teaching that He is a monad and tri-subsistent unity,
   providentially pervading all things through His Goodness, from the
   supercelestial Natures down to the lowest things of the earth; for He
   is the super-original Principle and Cause of every essence, and holds
   the whole universe superessentially in His irresistible embrace.

   indissoluble connection, likewise, and comnmunion of wholes, and a
   colligation of agents and patients, are surveyed in the
   world.'--Proclus, Theology of Plato, VI.4.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

   Of the Dominions, Virtues and Powers, and their middle Hierarchy.

   Now we must pass on to the middle Order of the Celestial Intelligences,
   contemplating with supermundane sight, as far as we may, the Dominions
   and the truly majestic splendour of the Divine Virtues and Powers. For
   the names of these supernal Beings denote the divine characteristics of
   their likeness to God.

   The name given to the holy Dominions signifies, I think, a certain
   unbounded elevation to that which is above, freedom from all that is of
   the earth, and from all inward inclination to the bondage of discord, a
   liberal superiority to harsh tyranny, an exemptness from degrading
   servility and from all that is low: for they are untouched by any
   inconsistency. They are true Lords, perpetually aspiring to true
   lordship, and to the Source of lordship, and they providentially
   fashion themselves and those below them, as far as possible, into the
   likeness of true lordship. They do not turn towards vain shadows, but
   wholly give themselves to that true Authority, forever one with the
   Godlike Source of lordship.

   The name of the holy Virtues signifies a certain powerful and
   unshakable virility welling forth into all their Godlike energies; not
   being weak and feeble for any reception of the divine Illuminations
   granted to it; mounting upwards in fullness of power to an assimilation
   with God; never falling away from the Divine Life through its own
   weakness, but ascending unwaveringly to the superessential Virtue which
   is the Source of virtue: fashioning itself, as far as it may, in
   virtue; perfectly turned towards the Source of virtue, and flowing
   forth providentially to those below it, abundantly filling them with
   virtue.

   The name of the holy Powers, co-equal with the Divine Dominions and
   Virtues, signifies an orderly and unconfined order in the divine
   receptions, and the regulation of intellectual and supermundane power
   which never debases its authority by tyrannical force, but is
   irresistibly urged onward in due order to the Divine. It beneficently
   leads those below it, as far as possible, to the Supreme Power which is
   the Source of Power, which it manifests after the manner of Angels in
   the wellordered ranks of its own authoritative power. This middle rank
   of the Celestial Intelligences, having these Godlike characteristics,
   is purified, illuminated and perfected in the manner already described,
   by the divine Illuminations bestowed upon it in a secondary manner
   through the first hierarchical Order, and shown forth in a secondary
   manifestation by the middle choir.

   The knowledge which is said to be imparted by one Angel to another may
   be interpreted as a symbol of that perfecting which is effected from
   afar and made obscure because of its passage to the second rank. For,
   as those say who are wise in the sacred Mysteries, the direct
   revelations of the Divine Light impart a greater perfection than those
   bestowed through an intermediary; and in the same way I consider that
   the Order of Angels which is established nearest to the Godhead
   participates directly in a more resplendent light than is imparted to
   those who are perfected through others.

   For this reason the First Intelligences are called in our priestly
   tradition perfective, illuminative and purificatory powers in regard to
   the lower Orders which are uplifted by them to the superessential
   Principle of all, and as far as is right for them are made partakers of
   the mystical purifications, illuminations and perfections. For this
   universal ordinance is divinely established, that the Divine Light is
   imparted to secondary natures through primary natures.

   You will find this variously set forth by theologians, for when the
   Divine and Fatherly Love for man reproved the Israelites and chastened
   them for their salvation by delivering them for their correction into
   the hands of cruel and barbaric nations, and with providential guidance
   led them back by many paths to a better condition, and mercifully
   recalled them from captivity to freedom and their former happy state,
   one of the theologians, named Zachariah, sees one of those Angels
   which, as I believe are first and nearest to God (for the name Angel,
   as I have said, is common to all), receiving from God Himself the words
   of comfort, as they are called, and another Angel of lower rank going
   to meet the first as if to receive and partake of the light, and then
   receiving from him, as from a hierarch, the divine purpose, being
   directed to reveal to the theologian that Jerusalem should be inhabited
   by a great and fruitful nation.

   Another theologian, Ezekiel, says that the most sacred edict came forth
   from the supremely glorious Godhead Itself, exalted above the Cherubim.
   For after the Father, as has been said, had in His mercy led the
   Children of Israel through disciplines to a better condition He decreed
   in His divine justice that the guilty should be separated from the
   innocent. This is first revealed to one below the Cherubim, who was
   girt about the loins with a sapphire, and was robed in a garment
   reaching to the feet, the symbol of an hierarch. But the Divine Law
   ordained that the other Angels armed with battle-axes should be
   instructed by the former respecting the divine judgment in this matter.
   For He directed the one to go through the midst of Jerusalem and to set
   a mark upon the foreheads of the innocent; but to the other Angels He
   said, Go into the city, following him, and strike, and turn not aside
   your eyes; but draw not near unto those upon whom is the mark'.

   What could be said concerning the Angel who said to Daniel, The Word
   has gone forth'? or concerning that highest one who took the fire from
   the midst of the Cherubim? Or what could establish more clearly the
   distinction between the angelic ranks than this, that the Cherub cast
   the fire into the hands of him who was clothed with the sacred
   vestment? Or that He who called the most divine Gabriel to Himself
   said, Make this man understand the vision'? And many other similar
   things are related by the venerable theologians regarding the Divine
   Order of the Celestial Hierarchies.

   By moulding itself after their likeness our own hierarchy will, as far
   as possible, be assimilated to it and will, in very deed, show forth,
   as in images, the angelic beauty; receiving its form from them, and
   being uplifted by them to the superessential Source of every Hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER IX

   Of the Principalities, Archangels and Angels, and of their last
   Hierarchy.

   There remains for us the reverent contemplation of that sacred Order
   which completes the Angelic Hierarchies, and is composed of the Divine
   Principalities, Archangels and Angels. And first, I think, I ought to
   explain to the best of my ability the meanings of their holy names.

   The name of the Celestial Principalities signifies their Godlike
   princeliness and authoritativeness in an Order which is holy and most
   fitting to the princely Powers, and that they are wholly turned towards
   the Prince of Princes, and lead others in princely fashion, and that
   they are formed, as far as possible, in the likeness of the Source of
   Principality, and reveal Its superessential order by the

   An image of angels

   An Image of an Angel by Perrugino

   good Order of the princely Powers.

   The choir of the holy Archangels is placed in the same threefold Order
   as the Celestial Principalities; for, as has been said, there is one
   Hierarchy and Order which includes these and the Angels. But since each
   Hierarchy has first, middle and last ranks, the holy Order of
   Archangels, through its middle position, participates in the two
   extremes, being joined with the most .holy Principalities and with the
   holy Angels.

   It is joined with the Princedoms because it is turned in a princely way
   to the superessential Principality and, as far as it can attain, moulds
   itself in His likeness, and it is seen to be the cause of the union of
   the Angels with its own orderly and invisible leadership. It is joined
   with the Angels because it belongs to the interpreting Order, receiving
   in its turn the illuminations from the First Powers, and beneficently
   announcing these revelations to the Angels; and by means of the Angels
   it shows them forth to us in the measure of the mystical receptivity of
   each one who is inspired by the divine Illumination. For the Angels, as
   we have said, fill up and complete the lowest choir of all the
   Hierarchies of the Celestial Intelligences since they are the last of
   the Celestial Beings possessing the angelic nature. And they, indeed,
   are more properly named Angels by us than are those of a higher rank
   because their choir is more directly in contact With manifested and
   mundane things.

   The highest Order, as we have said, being in the foremost place near
   the Hidden One, must be regarded as hierarchically ordering in a bidden
   manner the second Order; and the second Order of Dominions, Virtues and
   Powers, leads the Principalities, Archangels and Angels more
   manifestly, indeed, than the first Hierarchy, but in a more hidden
   manner than the Order below it; and the revealing Order of the
   Principalities, Archangels and Angels presides one through the other
   over the human hierarchies so that their elevation and turning to God
   and their communion and union with Him may be in order; and moreover,
   that the procession from God, beneficently granted to all the
   Hierarchies, and visiting them all in common, may be with the most holy
   order.

   Accordingly the Word of God has given our hierarchy into the care of
   Angels, for Michael is called Lord of the people of Judah, and other
   Angels are assigned to other peoples. For the Most High established the
   boundaries of the nations according to the number of the Angels of God.

   If someone should ask why the Hebrews alone were guided to the divine
   Illuminations, we should answer that the turning away of the nations to
   false gods ought not to be attributed to the direct guidance of Angels,
   but to their own refusal of the true path which leads to God, and the
   falling away through selflove and perversity, and similarly, the
   worship of things which they regarded as divine.

   Even the Hebrews are said to have acted thus, for he says, Thou hast
   cast away the knowledge of God and hast gone after thine own heart'.
   For our life is not ruled by necessity, nor are the divine irradiations
   of Providential Light obscured because of the freewill of those under
   Its care; but it is the dissimilarity of the mental eyes which causes
   the Light streaming forth resplendently from the Goodness of the Father
   to be either totally unshared and unaccepted through their resistance
   to It, or causes an unequal participation, small or great, dark or
   bright, of that Fontal Ray which nevertheless is one and unmixed,
   eternally changeless, and for ever abundantly shed forth. For even if
   certain Gods not alien to them presided over the other nations (from
   which we ourselves have come forth into that illimitable and abundant
   sea of Divine Light which is outspread freely for all to share), yet
   there is one Ruler of all, and to Him the Angels who minister to each
   nation lead their followers.

   Let us consider Melchisadek, the hierarch most beloved of God -- not of
   vain gods, but a priest of the truly highest of Gods -- for those wise
   in the things of God did not simply call Melchisadek the friend of God,
   but also priest, in order to show clearly to the wise that not only was
   he himself turned to Him who is truly God, but also, as hierarch, was
   the leader of others in the ascent to the true and only Godhead.

   Let us also remind you in connection with your knowledge of hierarchy
   that Pharaoh was shown through visions by the Angel who presided over
   the Egyptians, and the Prince of Babylon was shown by his own Angel,
   the watchful and overruling Power of Providence. And for those nations
   the servants of the true God were appointed as leaders, the
   interpretations of angelic visions having been revealed from God
   through Angels to holy men near to the Angels, like Daniel and Joseph.

   For there is one Sovereign and Providence of all, and we must never
   suppose that God was leader of the Jews by chance, nor that certain
   Angels, either independently, or with equal rank, or in opposition to
   one another, ruled over the other nations; but this teaching must be
   received according to the following holy intention, not as meaning that
   God had shared the sovereignty of mankind with other Gods, or with
   Angels, and had been chosen by chance as ruler and leader of Israel,
   but as showing that although one all-powerful Providence of the Most
   High consigned the whole of mankind to the care of their own Angels for
   their preservation, yet the Israelites, almost alone of them all,
   turned to the knowledge and light of the true God.

   Therefore the Word of God, when relating how Israel devoted himself to
   the worship of the true God, says, He became the Lord's portion'.
   Moreover it shows that he too, equally with other nations, was given
   into the charge of one of the holy Angels, in order that he might know
   through him the one Principle of all things. For it says that Michael
   was the leader of the Jews, clearly showing that there is one
   Providence established superessentially above all the invisible and
   visible powers, and that all the Angels who preside over the different
   nations lift up to that Providence, as to their own Principle, as far
   as is in their power, those who willingly follow them.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

   Recapitulation and summary of the Angelic Hierarchies.

   We have agreed that the most venerable Hierarchy of the Intelligences,
   which is close to God, is consecrated by His first and highest Ray, and
   uplifting itself directly to It, is purified, illuminated and perfected
   by the Light of the Godhead which is both more hidden and more
   revealed. It is more hidden because It is more intelligible, more
   simplifying, and more unitive, It is more revealed because It is the
   First Gift and the First Light, and more universal and more infused
   with the Godhead, as though transparent. And by this again the second
   in its own degree, and by the second the third, and by the third our
   hierarchy, according to the same law of the regular principle of order,
   in divine harmony and proportion, are hierarchically, led up to the
   super-primal Source and End of all good orders, according to that
   divinely established law.

   Each Order is the interpreter and herald of those above it, the most
   venerable being the interpreter of God who inspires them, and the
   others in turn of those inspired by God. For that superessential
   harmony of all things has provided most completely for the holy
   regulation and the sure guidance of rational and intellectual beings by
   the establishment of the beautiful choirs of each Hierarchy; and we see
   that every Hierarchy possesses first, middle and last powers.

   But to speak rightly, He also divided each rank in the same divine
   harmonies, and on this account the Scriptures say that the most divine
   Seraphim cry one to another, by which, as I think, it is clear that the
   first impart to the second their knowledge of divine things.

   This may fittingly be added, that each Celestial and human intelligence
   contains in itself its own first, middle and last powers, which are
   manifested in a way analogous to the aforesaid ordination belonging to
   each of the Hierarchical illuminations; and accordingly each
   intelligence, as far as is right and attainable to it, participates in
   the most spotless purity, the most abundant light, and the most
   complete perfection. For nothing is self-perfect nor absolutely
   unindigent of perfection, save only That which is truly self-perfect
   and above all perfection.

CHAPTER XI

   Why all the Celestial Hierarchies in common are called Celestial
   Powers.

   Now that these things have been defined, the reason for applying the
   general name, Celestial Powers, to all the Angelic beings demands our
   consideration. For we cannot say of these, as we can of the Angels,
   that the Order of the holy Powers is the last of all; moreover, the
   higher Orders of beings, indeed, have part in the illuminations of the
   lowest, but the last by no means possess those of the first. And for
   this reason all the Divine Intelligences are called Celestial Powers,
   but never Seraphim or Thrones or Dominions; since the lowest do not
   share in the whole characteristics of the highest. For the Angels, and
   the Archangels above them, and the Principalities, and the ranks which
   are placed by theology after the Powers, are frequent1y called by us
   Celestial Powers, in common with all the other holy beings.

   But we deny that in using the general name, Celestial Powers, for all
   we cause any confusion with regard to the characteristics of each
   Order. For all the Divine Celestial Intelligences are divided,
   according to the supermundane account of them, into three groups in
   respect of their essence, power and activity; and when we name all or
   some of them, loosely, Celestial Beings or Celestial Powers, we are
   referring to them indirectly in terms of that essence or power which
   each possesses.

   But we must not assign the highest characteristics of the holy Powers
   (which we have already well distinguished) to all the natures wholly
   below them, for this would bring confusion into the clear and
   harmonious Order of Angels: for, as we have frequently rightly shown,
   the highest Orders possess in fullest measure the holy characteristics
   of the lower, but the lowest do not possess the pre-eminent unitive
   principles of those more venerable than themselves, because the First
   Radiance is imparted to them through the first Orders according to
   their capacity.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XII

   Why the Hierarchs among men are called Angels.

   Those who earnestly study the holy Scriptures sometimes ask, If the
   lowest ranks do not possess to the full the powers of those above them,
   why is our Hierarch called in the holy Word the Angel of the Omnipotent
   Lord?'

   This, however, does not contradict what has been already defined. For
   we say that the lowest choirs do not possess the integral and
   pre-eminent power of the higher Orders, since they receive it
   partially, in the measure of their capacity, in accordance with the one
   harmonious and binding fellowship of all things.

   For example, the choir of the holy Cherubim participates in higher
   wisdom and knowledge, whilst the Orders below them are themselves also
   partakers of wisdom and knowledge, but more partially, and in a lower
   degree proportioned to their capacity. For the universal participation
   in wisdom and knowledge is shared by all the Divine Intelligences, but
   the degree of participation, whether immediate and first, or second and
   inferior, is not common, but is determined for each by its own rank.
   This also may be rightly said of all the Divine Intelligences, that
   even as the first possess in the highest degree the holy
   characteristics of the Orders below them, so the lowest possess the
   powers of the higher, not in equal measure, but in a subordinate
   degree.

   Therefore I do not think it unreasonable that the Scriptures should
   call our hierarchs Angels, since they participate according to their
   own power in the interpretative characteristic of the Angels, and
   uplift themselves, as far as is possible to man, into an assimilation
   to the Angels as revealers of truth.

   You will find, moreover, that the Word of God not only calls these
   Celestial Beings above us Gods, but also gives this name to saintly men
   amongst us, and to those men who, in the highest degree, are lovers of
   God; although the First and Unmanifest God superessentially transcends
   all things, being enthroned above all, and therefore none of the beings
   or things which are can truly be said to be wholly like Him, save in so
   far as those intellectual and rational beings who are wholly turned
   towards union with Him, as far as is in their power, and who, uplifting
   themselves perpetually, as far as possible, to the Divine Radiance, in
   the imitation of God (if it be lawful so to speak) with all their
   powers, are thought worthy of the same divine name.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XIII

   The reason why the prophet Isaiah is said to have been purified by the
   Seraphim.

   Let us now deal to the best of our ability with the question why the
   Seraph is said to have been sent to one of the prophets. For someone
   may feel doubt or uncertainty as to why one of the beings of the
   highest rank is mentioned as cleansing the prophet, instead of one of
   the lower ranks of Angels.

   Some, indeed, say that according to the description already given of
   the inter-relation of all the Intelligences, the passage does not refer
   to one of the first of the Intelligences nearest to God, as having come
   to purify the hierarch, but that one of those Angels who are our
   guardians was called by the same name as the Seraphim because of his
   sacred function of purifying the prophet, for the reason that the
   remission of sins and the regeneration of him who was purified to
   obedience to God was accomplished through fire. And they say also that
   the passage simply says one of the Seraphim, not of those established
   around God, but of the purifying powers which preside over us.

   But another suggested to me a solution of the problem by no means
   unlikely, for he said that the great Angel, whoever he may have been,
   who fashioned this vision for the purpose of instructing the prophet in
   divine matters, referred his own office of purification first to God,
   and after God to that first Hierarchy. And is not this statement true?
   For he who said this said that the Divine First Power goes forth
   visiting all things, and irresistibly penetrates all things, and yet is
   invisible to all, not only as superessentially transcending all things,
   but also because It transmits Its Providential Energies in a hidden way
   through all things. Moreover, It is revealed to all Intellectual
   Natures in due proportion, and bestows the radiance of Its Light upon
   the most exalted beings through whom, as leaders, It is imparted to the
   lower choirs in order according to their power of divine contemplation;
   or to speak in more simple terms, by way of illustration (for although
   natural things do not truly resemble God, who transcends all, yet they
   are more easily seen by us), the light of the sun passes readily
   through the first matter, for this is more transparent, and by means of
   this it displays more brightly its own brilliance; but when it falls
   upon some denser material it is shed forth again less brightly because
   the material which is illuminated is not adapted for the transmission
   of light, and after this it is little by little diminished until it
   hardly passes through at all. Similarly, the heat of fire imparts
   itself more readily to that which is more adapted to receive it, being
   yielding and conductive to its likeness; but upon substances of
   opposite nature which are resistant to it, either no effect at all or
   only a slight trace of the action of the fire appears; and what is
   more, when fire is applied to materials of opposite nature through the
   use of other substances receptive to it the fire first heats the
   material which is easily made hot, and through it, heats
   proportionately the water or other substance which does not so easily
   become hot.

   Thus, according to the same law of the material order, the Fount of all
   order, visible and invisible, supernaturally shows forth the glory of
   Its own radiance in all-blessed outpourings of first manifestation to
   the highest beings, and through them those below them participate in
   the Divine Ray. For since these have the highest knowledge of God, and
   desire pre-eminently the Divine Goodness, they are thought worthy to
   become first workers, as far as can be attained, of the imitation of
   the Divine Power and Energy, and beneficently uplift those below them,
   as far as is in their power, to the same imitation by shedding
   abundantly upon them the splendour which has come upon themselves;
   while these, in turn, impart their light to lower choirs. And thus,
   throughout the whole Hierarchy, the higher impart that which they
   receive to the lower, and through the Divine Providence all are granted
   participation in the Divine Light in the measure of their receptivity.

   There is, therefore, one Source of Light for everything which is
   illuminated, namely, God, who by His Nature, truly and rightly, is the
   Essence of Light, and Cause of being and of vision. But it is ordained
   that in imitation of God each of the higher ranks of beings is the
   source in turn for the one which follows it; since the Divine Rays are
   passed through it to the other. Therefore the beings of all the Angelic
   ranks naturally consider the highest Order of the Celestial
   Intelligences as the source, after God, of all holy knowledge and
   imitation of God, because through them the Light of the Supreme God is
   imparted to all and to us. On this account they refer all holy works,
   in imitation of God, to God as the Ultimate Cause, but to the first
   Divine Intelligences as the first regulators and transmitters of Divine
   Energies.

   Therefore the first Order of the holy Angels possesses above all others
   the characteristic of fire, and the abundant participation of Divine
   Wisdom, and the possession of the highest knowledge of the Divine
   Illuminations, and the characteristic of Thrones which symbolizes
   openness to the reception of God. The lower Orders of the Celestial
   Beings participate also in these fiery, wise and God-receptive Powers,
   but in a lower degree, and as looking to those above them who, being
   thought worthy of the primary imitation of God, uplift them, as far as
   possible, into the likeness of God.

   These holy characteristics in which the secondary natures are granted
   participation through the first, they ascribe to those very
   Intelligences, after God, as Hierarchs.

   He who gave this explanation used to say that the vision was shown to
   the prophet by one of those holy and blessed Angels who preside over
   us, by whose enlightening guidance he was raised to that intellectual
   contemplation in which he beheld the most exalted Beings (to speak in
   symbols) established under God, with God and around God; and their
   super-princely Leader, ineffably uplifted above them all, established
   in the midst of the supremely exalted Powers.

   The prophet, therefore, learned from these visions that, according to
   every superessential excellence, the divine One subsists in
   incomparable pre-eminence, excelling all visible and invisible powers,
   above and exempt from all; and that He bears no likeness even to those
   first-subsisting Beings; and moreover that He is the Principle and
   Cause of all being, and the Immutable Foundation of the abiding
   stability of things that are, from which the most exalted Powers have
   both their being and their well-being. Then he was instructed that the
   Divine Powers of the holy Scriptures, whose sacred name means The Fiery
   Ones', and of which we shall soon speak, as far as we can, led the
   upliftment of the fiery power towards the Divine Likeness.

   When the holy prophet saw in the sacred vision of the sixfold wings the
   most high and absolute upliftment to the Divine in first, middle and
   last Intelligences, and beheld their many feet and many faces, and
   perceived that their eyes and their feet were covered by their wings,
   and that the middle wings were in ceaseless movement, he was guided to
   the intelligible knowledge of that which was seen through the
   revelation to him of the farreaching and far-seeing power of the most
   exalted Intelligences, and of their holy awe which they have in a
   supermundane manner in the bold and persistent and unending search into
   higher and deeper Mysteries, and the perfect harmony of their ceaseless
   activity in imitation of God, and their perpetual upward soaring to the
   heights.

   Moreover, he also learned that divine and most glorious song of praise;
   for the Angel who fashioned the vision gave, as far as possible, his
   own holy knowledge to the prophet. He also taught him that every
   participation in the Divine Light and Purity, as far as this may be
   attained, is a purification, even to the most pure. Having its source
   in the Most High God, it proceeds from the most exalted Causes in a
   superessential and hidden manner, traversing the whole of the Divine
   Intelligences, and yet it shows itself more clearly, and imparts itself
   more fully to the most exalted Powers around God.

   But as to the secondary or last intellectual powers, or our own powers,
   in proportion as each is further from the Divine Likeness, so the
   Divine Ray enfolds Its most brilliant light within Its own ineffable
   and hidden Unity. Moreover, It illuminates the second Orders severally
   through the first, and in short, It comes forth originally into
   manifestation from the Unmanifest through the first Powers.

   The prophet was taught by the Angel who was leading him to light that
   the divine purification, and all the other divine activities shining
   forth through the First Beings, are imparted to all the others in the
   measure of the fitness of each for the divine participations.

   Wherefore he reasonably assigned to the Seraphim, after God, the
   characteristic of imparting purification by fire. And there is nothing
   unreasonable in the representation of the Seraph as purifying the
   prophet; for just as God Himself, the cause of every purification,
   purifies all, or rather (to use a more familar illustration), just as
   our hierarch, when purifying or enlightening through his priests or
   ministers, may himself be said to purify and illuminate, because

   An image of angels

   Cherubs, by Pinturicchio

   those orders which he has consecrated refer their sacred activities to
   him, so also the Angel who purifies the prophet refers his own
   purifying power and knowledge to God as its origin, but to the Seraph
   as the first working Hierarch--as though saying with angelic reverence
   when instructing him who was being purified: There is an exempt Source
   and Essence and Creator and Cause of the purification effected in you
   by me, He who brings into being the First Beings, and holds them
   established round Himself, and preserves their changeless stability,
   and guides them towards the first participations in His own
   Providential Energies.' (For this, so he said who taught me, shows the
   mission of the Seraph.) But the Hierarch and Leader, after God, the
   first Order of the first Beings, by whom I was taught to perform the
   divine purifications, is that which purifies thee through me; and
   through it the Cause and Creator of all purification brought forth His
   Providential Energies to us from the hidden depths.'

   Thus he taught me, and I in turn impart it to thee. It is for thy
   intellectual and discriminating skill either to accept one of the two
   reasons given as a solution of the difficulty, and prefer that to the
   other as probable and reasonable and perhaps true, or to find from
   thyself something more akin to the real truth, or learn from another
   (God indeed giving the word, and Angels directing it), and then to
   reveal to us who love the Angels a clearer, and to me more welcome
   view, if such should be possible.

CHAPTER XIV

   What the traditional number of the Angels signifies.

   This also is worthy, I think, of intellectual consideration, that the
   scriptural tradition respecting the Angels gives their number as
   thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand, multiplying
   and repeating the very highest numbers we have, thus clearly showing
   that the Orders of the Celestial Beings are innumerable for us; so many
   are the blessed Hosts of the Supermundane Intelligences, wholly
   surpassing the feeble and limited range of our material numbers. And
   they are definitely known only by their own supermundane and celestial
   Intellect and the knowledge which is granted to them allbounteously by
   the All-knowing Mother-Wisdom of the Most High God, which is
   superessentially at once the substantiating Cause, the connecting
   Power, and the universal Consummation of all principles and things.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER XV

   What is the meaning of the formal semblances of the Angelic Powers?
   What of the fiery and the anthropomorphic? What is meant by their yes,
   nostrils, ears, mouths, touch, eyelids eyebrows their manhood, teeth,
   shoulders, arms, hands, heart, breasts, backs, feet and wings? What are
   the nakedness and the vesture, the shining raiment, the priestly
   insignia, the girdles? What are the rods, spears, battle-axes and
   measuring-lines? What are the winds and clouds? What is meant by their
   brass and electron? What are the choirs and the clapping of bands? What
   are the colours of the various jewels? What is the form of the lion,
   the ox, the eagle? What are the horses, and their various colours? What
   are the rivers, the chariots, the wheels? What is the so-called joy of
   the Angels?

   Let us, if you are so disposed, now relax our mental vision from the
   effort of the contemplation of the sublimity of the Angels, and descend
   to the particularized, all-various expanse of the manifold diversity of
   forms in angelic images; and then return analytically from them, as
   from symbols, ascending again to the simplicity of the Celestial
   Intelligences. But first let me point out clearly to you that the
   explanations of the sacred likenesses represent the same Orders of
   Celestial Beings sometimes as leading, and again being led, and the
   last leading and the first being led, and the same ones, as has been
   said, having first, middle and last powers. But there is nothing
   unreasonable in the account, according to the following method of
   unfoldment.

   If, indeed, we said that some are first governed by those above them,
   and afterwards govern those Orders, and that the highest, whilst
   leading the lowest ranks, are at the same time being led by those whom
   they are leading, the statement would be obviously absurd and wholly
   confused. But if we say that these holy Orders both lead and are led,
   but not the same ones, nor by the same ones, but that each is led by
   those above itself, and in turn leads those below it, we may reasonably
   say that the Scripture in its sacred symbolic presentation sometimes
   rightly and truly assigns the same powers to the first, middle and last
   ranks.

   Wherefore the eager upward tending to those above them, and the
   constancy of their revolution around them, being guardians of their own
   powers, and their participation in the providential power of proceeding
   forth to those below them through their own inter-relations, will truly
   befit all the Celestial Beings, although some pre-eminently and
   universally, others in a partial and lower degree.

   But we must begin to deal with the remaining part of our discourse, and
   must ask, in first explanation of the forms, why the Word of God
   prefers the sacred symbol of fire almost above all others. For you will
   find that it is used not only under the figure of fiery wheels, but
   also of living creatures of fire, and of men flashing like lightning
   who heap live coals of fire about the Heavenly Beings, and of
   irresistibly rushing rivers of flame. Also it says that the Thrones are
   of fire, and it shows from their name that the most exalted Seraphim
   themselves are burning with fire, assigning to them the qualities and
   forces of fire; and throughout, above and below, it gives the highest
   preference to the symbol of fire.

   Therefore I think that this image of fire signifies the perfect
   conformity to God of the Celestial Intelligences For the holy prophets
   frequently liken that which is superessential and formless to fire
   which (if it may lawfully be said) possesses many resemblances as in
   visible things to the Divine Reality. For the sensible fire is in some
   manner in everything, and pervades all things without mingling with
   them, and is exempt from all things and, although wholly bright, yet
   lies essentially hidden and unknown when not in contact with any
   substance on which it can exert its own energy. It is irresistible and
   invisible, having absolute rule over all things, bringing under its own
   power all things in which it subsists. It has transforming power, and
   imparts itself in some measure to everything near it. It revives all
   things by its revivifying heat, and illuminates them all with its
   resplendent brightness. It is insuperable and pure, possessing
   separative power, but itself changeless, uplifting, penetrative, high,
   not held back by servile baseness, ever-moving, selfmoved, moving other
   things. It comprehends, but is incomprehensible, unindigent,
   mysteriously increasing itself and showing forth its majesty according
   to the nature of the substance receiving it, powerful, mighty,
   invisibly present to all things. When not thought of, it seems not to
   exist, but suddenly enkindles its light in the way proper to its nature
   by friction, as though seeking to do so, uncontrollably flying upwards
   without diminishing its all-blessed self-giving.

   Thus many properties of fire may be found which symbolize through
   sensible images the Divine activities. Knowing this, those wise in the
   things of God have portrayed the Celestial Beings under the figure of
   fire, thus proclaiming their likeness to the Divine, and their
   imitation of Him in the measure of their power.

   But they also invest them with the likeness of men because of the human
   powers of intellect and aspiration, the straight and erect form, the
   inherent power of guiding and governing; and because man, although
   least in sense-perception in comparison with the powers of irrational
   creatures, yet rules over them all through the pre-eminence of his
   intellect, the lordship of his rational knowledge, and the intrinsic
   freedom of his unconquerable soul.

   Thus it is possible, I think, to find in the various parts of our
   bodies fitting symbols of the Celestial Powers by taking, for example,
   the power of sight as an image of their most transparent upliftment to
   the Divine Light, their single, free, unresisting reception of that
   Light, their responsiveness and pure receptivity without passion to the
   divine illuminations.

   The human power of distinguishing odours signifies the power to receive
   the inconceivable and most fragrant divine influences, as

   An image of angels

   An Angel as envisioned by Rembrandt

   far as is attainable, and the definite recognition and utter rejection
   of others not of this kind.

   The power of the ears denotes participation in and conscious gnostic
   receptivity to divine inspiration. The power of taste represents an
   abundance of spiritual food and the reception of divine streams of
   nourishment.

   The power of touch symbolizes the power of distinguishing that which is
   of advantage from that which is harmful. The eyelids and eyebrows
   represent the guarding of intellectual conceptions in divine
   contemplations. The images of youth and vigour denote their perpetual
   bloom and vigour of life. The teeth symbolize the distribution of the
   sustaining perfection supplied to them; for each Intellectual Order,
   receiving a unitive conception from the Divine, with Providential Power
   divides and multiplies it for the proportionate upliftment of the one
   below.

   The shoulders, arms and hands signify the powers of activity and
   accomplishment. The heart is a symbol of that Divine Life which imparts
   its own life-giving power beneficently to those within its care. We may
   add that the chest, being placed over the heart, represents the
   indomitable power which guards its own life-giving dispensations. The
   back denotes that strength which holds together all the life-giving
   powers. The feet signify the power of motion, swiftness and skilfulness
   in the evermoving advance towards divine things. Wherefore the prophet
   described the feet of the Celestial Intelligences as being covered by
   their wings which symbolize a swift soaring to the heights, and the
   heavenly progression up the steep, and the exemption from everything
   earthly through the upward ascent. The lightness of the wings shows
   that they are altogether heavenly and unsullied and untrammelled in
   their upliftment on high. The naked and unshod feet symbolize their
   free, easy and unrestrained power, pure from all externality, and
   assimilated, as far as is attainable, to the Divine Simplicity.

   But since that single and manifold Wisdom both clothes the naked and
   assigns to them implements to carry, let us unfold, as far as we can,
   these sacred garments and instruments of the Celestial Intelligences.

   Their shining and fiery vestures symbolizes, I think, the Divine
   Likeness under the image of fire, and their own enlightening power,
   because they abide in Heaven, where Light is: and also it shows that
   they impart wholly intelligible Light, and are enlightened
   intellectually.

   Their priestly garment symbolizes their authority as leaders to the
   mystical and divine contemplations, and the consecration of their whole
   life. The girdles denote their guardianship of their own generative
   power, and their state of unification, for they are wholly drawn
   together towards their essential unity surrounding it in a perfect
   circle with changeless sameness.

   The rods are tokens of the authority of sovereignty and leadership and
   the true directing of all things. The spears and battle-axes represent
   the power of dividing incongruous things and the keen, vigorous and
   effectual power of discrimination. The measuring-lines and carpenters'
   tools are figures of the power of foundation and erection and
   perfection, and whatever else belongs to the providential guidance and
   upliftment of the lower orders. Sometimes, however, the implements
   assigned to the holy Angels symbolize the divine judgment upon
   ourselves; for some are figures of His corrective discipline of
   avenging justice, others of freedom from difficulties, or the
   perfection of disciplinary instruction, or the restoration to our first
   happiness, while others signify the addition of other gifts, great or
   small, sensible or intelligible; and no acute mind would have any
   difficulty at all in finding the correspondence between the visible
   symbols and the invisible realities.

   The name winds given to the Angels denotes their swift operations, and
   their almost immediate impenetration of everything, and a transmitting
   power in all realms, reaching from the above to the below, and from the
   depths to the heights, and the power which uplifts the second natures
   to the height above them, and moves the first to a participative and
   providential upliftment of the lower.

   But perhaps it may be said that the name winds, applied to the aerial
   spirit, signifies the Divine Likeness in the Celestial Beings. For the
   figure is a true image and type of Divine Energy (as is shown more
   fully in the Symbolical Theology in our fourfold explanation)
   corresponding to the moving and generative forces of Nature, and a
   swift and irresistible advance, and the mystery, unknown and unseen by
   us, of the motive principles and ends. For He says: Thou knowest not
   whence it cometh nor whither it goeth.' The Scriptures also depict them
   as a cloud, showing by this that these holy Intelligences are filled in
   a supermundane manner with the hidden Light, receiving that first
   revelation without undue glorying, and transmitting it with abundant
   brightness to the lower Orders as a secondary, proportionate
   illumination; and further, that they, possess generating, lifegiving,
   increasing and perfecting powers by reason of their intelligible
   outpourings, as of showers quickening the receptive womb of earth by
   fertilizing rains for life-giving travail.

   The Scriptures also liken the Celestial Beings to brass and electron,
   and many coloured jewels. Now electron, [an alloy of silver and gold]
   resembling both gold and silver, is like gold in its resistance to
   corruption unspent and undiminished, and its undimmed brightness; and
   is like silver in its shining and heavenly lustre. But the symbolism of
   brass (in line with the explanations already given) must resemble that
   of fire or gold. Again, of the many coloured varieties of stones, the
   white represents that which is luminous, and the red corresponds to
   fire, yellow to gold, and green to youth and vigour. Thus corresponding
   to each figure you will find a mystical interpretation which relates
   these symbolical images to the things above.

   But now, since this has been sufficiently explained, I think, according
   to our ability, let us pass on to the sacred unfoldment of the
   symbolism which depicts the Celestial Intelligences in the likeness of
   beasts.

   The form of a lion must be regarded as typifying their power of
   sovereignty, strength and indomitableness, and the ardent striving
   upward with all their powers to that most hidden, ineffable, mysterious
   Divine Unity and the covering of the intellectual foot-prints, [7] and
   the mystically modest concealment of the way leading to divine union
   through the Divine Illumination.

   The figure of the ox signifies strength and vigour and the opening of
   the intellectual furrows to the reception of fertilizing showers; and
   the horns signify the guarding and unconquerable power. The form of the
   eagle signifies royalty and high soaring and swiftness of flight and
   the eager seizing of that food which renews their strength, discretion,
   and ease of movement and skill, with strong intensity of vision which
   has the power to gaze unhindered, directly and unflinchingly upon the
   full and brilliant splendour of the brightness of the Divine Sun.

   The symbolism of horses represents obedience and tractability. The
   shining white horses denote clear truth and that which is perfectly
   assimilated to the Divine Light the dark, that which is hidden and
   secret; the red, fiery might and energy; the dappled black and white,
   that power which traverses all and connects the extremes,
   providential1y and with perfecting power uniting the highest to the
   lowest and the lowest to the highest.

   If we had not to bear in mind the length of our discourse, we might
   well describe the symbolic relations of the particular characteristics
   of animals already given, and all their bodily forms, with the powers
   of the Celestial Intelligences according to dissimilar similitudes: for
   example, their fury of anger represents an intellectual power of
   resistance of which anger is the last and faintest echo; their desire
   symbolizes the Divine Love; and in short, we might find in all the
   irrational tendencies and many parts of irrational creatures, figures
   of the immaterial conceptions and single powers of the Celestial
   Beings. This, however, is enough for the prudent, for one mystical
   interpretation will sufficiently serve as an example for the
   explanation of others of a similar kind.

   We must now consider the representations of the Celestial Beings in
   connection with rivers and wheels and chariots. The rivers of flame
   denote those Divine Channels which fill them with super-abundant and
   eternally out-pouring streams and nourish their life-giving
   prolificness.

   The chariots symbolize the conjoined fellowship of those of the same
   Order; the winged wheels, ever moving onward, never turning back or
   going aside, denote the power of their progressive energy on a straight
   and direct path in which all their intellectual revolutions are
   supermundanely guided upon that straight and unswerving course.

   The figure of the spiritual wheels can also have another mystical
   meaning, for the prophet says that the name Gel, Gel is given to them,
   which in the Hebrew tongue means revolutions and revelations. For the
   divine fiery wheels truly revolve, by reason of their ceaseless
   movement, around the highest Good Itself, and they are granted
   revelations because to them the holy hidden Mysteries are made clear,
   and the earthly are lifted up, and the high illuminations are brought
   down and imparted to the lowest orders.

   The last thing for us to explain is the joy attributed to the Celestial
   Orders. For they are utterly above and beyond our passionate pleasures.
   But they are said to rejoice with God over the finding of that which
   was lost, as well befits the Godlike mildness of their nature, and as
   befits their beneficent and boundless joy at the providential salvation
   of those who are turned to God, and that ineffable bliss in which holy
   men have often participated when the illuminations of God have divinely
   visited them.

   Let this be a sufficient account of those sacred symbols which,
   although it falls far short of their full interpretation, will yet, I
   think, contribute to prevent us from lingering basely in the figures
   and forms themselves.

   If you should point out that we have not mentioned in order all the
   Angelic powers, activities and images described in the scriptures, we
   should answer truly that we do not possess the supermundane knowledge
   of some, or rather that we have need of another to guide us to the
   light and instruct us; but others have been passed over for the sake of
   proportion, as being parallel to what has been given; and the hidden
   Mysteries which lie beyond our view we have honoured by silence.
