   Spencer, Herbert

   "First Principles of a New Philosophy": he teaches that the unity of

   asserts the correlation of physical and mental forces, but admits that
   it is mysterious how light becomes a mode of consciousness, i. 273.

   Spinoza (b. 1632),

   admitted the existence of only one substance of which the attributes
   are thought and extension, i. 331; the infinite alone is real, all else
   is phenomenal or apparent, i. 331; hence finite minds are transient
   manifestations of the infinite mind, i. 301; human thoughts or acts are
   simply forms of God's activity, i. 303; there is no freedom of action
   in God or man, i. 303; sin not a moral evil, it is simply limitation of

   the Scriptures teach that He possesses all these attributes, i. 380.

   Spontaneity,

   often used as antithetical to necessity, for voluntary action: in this
   sense, materialists deny that there is any evidence of spontaneity in
   nature, i. 271, 278, iii. 696; sometimes the word is used as
   antithetical to reflection or deliberation: in this sense, any feeling

   on vows, iii. 318.

   Tigurinus, Consensus,

   the most authoritative symbol of the Reformed Churches on the
   sacraments, iii. 517; it teaches, that those who by faith receive the
   sign receive the grace signified, iii. 517; they have no virtue in
   themselves, their operation is due to the attending power of the
   Spirit, iii. 517; they therefore do not confer grace to all who do not
   oppose any obstacle, iii. 517; believers receive without the sacraments
   the benefits received in their use, iii. 517, 640; the benefits of the
   sacraments not confined to the time of their administration, iii. 518,
   581; God sometimes regenerates in their old age those baptized in
   infancy, iii. 581; as to the Lord's supper, the local presence of
   Christ's body therein, is denied: his body is not elsewhere than in
   heaven, 632; the words of institution, "This is my body," are to be
   understood figuratively, iii. 632; we receive by faith the body and
   blood by the power of the Holy Spirit, not their substance, but their
   virtue as an expiatory sacrifice, iii. 632; it repudiates the doctrine
   of transubstantiation and condemns the adoration of the host, iii. 633.

   Transubstantiation,

   statement of the doctrine of the Council of Trent, iii. 679; the body
   of Christ being inseparable from his soul and divinity, He, as to body,
   soul, and divinity, is present in the Eucharist, and orally received by
   the communicant, iii. 681; the consecrated elements are to be adored:
   to them is due latreia, or the highest kind of worship, iii. 681; hence
   in the, Eucharist, or mass, a true propitiatory sacrifice is offered
   unto God, iii. 685; this doctrine of transubstantiation and its
   adjuncts are the great source of the corruptions of the Church of Rome,
   iii. 688.

   necessary instrumental cause is baptism; faith the predisposing cause,
   iii. 166; all this relates to the first justification by which the
   sinner is made holy, iii. 166; of the second justification which gives
   a title to eternal life, good works (works done after regeneration) are

   grace which it contains and signifies, but baptism alone is necessary
   to salvation, iii. 520, 609, 746; in the three sacraments, baptism,
   confirmation, and orders, an indelible character is impressed on the
   soul, iii. 611; on the Lord's supper as a sacrament, iii. 673 ff.; on
   the Lord's supper as a sacrifice, iii. 685 ff.

   Trichotomy,

   different forms of the doctrine, ii. 47; it is contrary to the current
   representations of the Bible, everything there predicated of the spirit
   (pneuma), is predicated of the soul (psuche), ii. 48, 49; First
   Thessalonians v. 23, Hebrews iv. 12, and First Corinthians xv. 44, may

   the primary element of faith, iii. 42; Protestants assert and Romanists
   deny that trust enters into the nature of saving faith, iii. 91 ff.

   Truth,

   according to Scripture is that which is trustworthy: it is that which
   is what it appears or is declared to be, i. 436; the truth of God as a
   divine attribute, is that perfection of his nature which renders Him in
   every aspect worthy of entire confidence, i. 437; it is therefore the
   foundation not only of all religion but also of all knowledge. i. 437;

   happiness is the end of creation. i. 436.

   Tyler, Professor Samuel (Washington, D. C.),

   his "Progress of Philosophy:" his view of Hamilton's doctrine that God
   is an object of faith, but not of knowledge, i. 350; he himself teaches
   that. as our intelligence of God is by analogy, it matters little
   whether the conviction be called knowledge or faith i. 360.

   Tyndall, Professor John (London),

   the physics of the brain throw no light on the facts of consciousness:
   that a definite thought and a definite molecular action of the brain
   occur simultaneously teaches us nothing of the relation of the one to
   the other, i. 251; the evolution of life and especially of mind from
   lifeless matter pronounced an absurdity too monstrous to be
   entertained, pro. vided matter be what it is generally taken to be, ii.
   8, 9; but if spirit and matter are only two opposite faces of the "same
   great mystery," the case is different, ii. 9; the evolution hypothesis
   does not solve the mystery of the universe, it only transposes the
   conception of the origin of life to the indefinitely distant past, ii.
   10; everything is to be referred to the operation of physical causes;
   no evidence of spontaneous action, i.e., of will, ever having occurred
   in nature, iii. 696; prayer for rain is as absurd as praying that the
