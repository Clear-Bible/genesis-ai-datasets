   Spencer, Herbert

   "First Principles of a New Philosophy": he teaches that the unity of

   asserts the correlation of physical and mental forces, but admits that
   it is mysterious how light becomes a mode of consciousness, i. 273.

   Spinoza (b. 1632),

   admitted the existence of only one substance of which the attributes
   are thought and extension, i. 331; the infinite alone is real, all else
   is phenomenal or apparent, i. 331; hence finite minds are transient
   manifestations of the infinite mind, i. 301; human thoughts or acts are
   simply forms of God's activity, i. 303; there is no freedom of action
   in God or man, i. 303; sin not a moral evil, it is simply limitation of

   the Scriptures teach that He possesses all these attributes, i. 380.

   Spontaneity,

   often used as antithetical to necessity, for voluntary action: in this
   sense, materialists deny that there is any evidence of spontaneity in
   nature, i. 271, 278, iii. 696; sometimes the word is used as
   antithetical to reflection or deliberation: in this sense, any feeling
   or act is spontaneous which reveals itself in the consciousness by a

   Transubstantiation,

   statement of the doctrine of the Council of Trent, iii. 679; the body
   of Christ being inseparable from his soul and divinity, He, as to body,
   soul, and divinity, is present in the Eucharist, and orally received by
   the communicant, iii. 681; the consecrated elements are to be adored:
   to them is due latreia, or the highest kind of worship, iii. 681; hence
   in the, Eucharist, or mass, a true propitiatory sacrifice is offered
   unto God, iii. 685; this doctrine of transubstantiation and its

   iii. 166; all this relates to the first justification by which the

   the Lord's supper as a sacrifice, iii. 685 ff.

   Trichotomy,

   (pneuma), is predicated of the soul (psuche), ii. 48, 49; First
   Thessalonians v. 23, Hebrews iv. 12, and First Corinthians xv. 44, may

   deny that trust enters into the nature of saving faith, iii. 91 ff.

   Truth,

   according to Scripture is that which is trustworthy: it is that which
   is what it appears or is declared to be, i. 436; the truth of God as a
   divine attribute, is that perfection of his nature which renders Him in
   every aspect worthy of entire confidence, i. 437; it is therefore the

   Tyler, Professor Samuel (Washington, D. C.),

   his "Progress of Philosophy:" his view of Hamilton's doctrine that God
   is an object of faith, but not of knowledge, i. 350; he himself teaches
   that. as our intelligence of God is by analogy, it matters little
   whether the conviction be called knowledge or faith i. 360.

   Tyndall, Professor John (London),

   the physics of the brain throw no light on the facts of consciousness:
   that a definite thought and a definite molecular action of the brain
   occur simultaneously teaches us nothing of the relation of the one to
   the other, i. 251; the evolution of life and especially of mind from
   lifeless matter pronounced an absurdity too monstrous to be
   entertained, pro. vided matter be what it is generally taken to be, ii.
   8, 9; but if spirit and matter are only two opposite faces of the "same
   great mystery," the case is different, ii. 9; the evolution hypothesis
   does not solve the mystery of the universe, it only transposes the
   conception of the origin of life to the indefinitely distant past, ii.
   10; everything is to be referred to the operation of physical causes;
   no evidence of spontaneous action, i.e., of will, ever having occurred
   in nature, iii. 696; prayer for rain is as absurd as praying that the
