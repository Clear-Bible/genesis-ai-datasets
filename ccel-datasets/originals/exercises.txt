                         APPROBATION OF THE LATIN TEXTS

   The Exercises were offered for ecclesiastical censure at Rome. The text
   submitted was not, however, the one which is here reproduced, but two
   Latin translations, one in more polished Latin--since called the
   Vulgate Version--and one a literal rendering. The opinions expressed on
   these versions, as also the formal approval of Paul III, are given
   here, as applying quite entirely to the text from which the
   translations were made.
     __________________________________________________________________

VULGATE VERSION

   We have read everything compiled in the volume: it has greatly pleased
   us and seemed remarkably conducive to the salvation of souls.

   The Cardinal of Burgos

   We grant leave to print the work; it is worthy of all praise and very
   profitable to the Christian profession.

   Philip, Vicar.

   Such holy Exercises cannot but afford the greatest profit to any one
   who studies them. They should therefore be received with open arms.

LITERAL VERSION

   We have read these Spiritual Exercises, They greatly please us and we
   judge them worthy of being received and highly esteemed by all who
   practise the orthodox faith.

   The Cardinal of Burgos

   We grant leave to print this work; it is worthy of all praise and very
   profitable to the Christian profession.

   Philip, Vicar.

   As the Christian religion cannot long subsist without some spiritual
   exercises and meditations--for the Psalmist says: In my meditation a
   fire flames out--I think none more appropriate than these, which
   undoubtedly have had their source in the study of the Scriptures and in
   long experience.

                   PAUL III, POPE FOR A PERPETUAL REMEMBRANCE

   The cares of the pastoral charge of the whole flock of Christ entrusted
   to Us and Our devotion to the glory and praise of God impel Us to
   embrace what helps the salvation of souls and their spiritual profit,
   and cause Us to hearken to those who petition Us for what can foster
   and nourish piety in the faithful.

   So Our beloved son, Francis de Borgia, Duke of Gandia, has lately
   brought it to Our notice that Our beloved son Ignatius de Loyola,
   General of the Society of Jesus, erected by Us in Our beloved City and
   confirmed by Our Apostolic authority, has compiled certain
   instructions, or Spiritual Exercises, drawn from Holy Writ and from
   experience in the spiritual life, and has reduced them to an order
   which is excellently adapted to move piously the souls of the faithful,
   and that they are very useful and wholesome for the spiritual
   consolation and profit of the same. This the said Duke Francis has come
   to know by report from many places and by clear evidence at Barcelona,
   Valencia and Gandia.

   Hence he has humbly begged Us to cause the aforesaid instructions and
   Spiritual Exercises to be examined, so that their fruit may be more
   spread, and more of the faithful may be induced to use them with
   greater devotion. And he has begged Us, should We find them worthy, to
   approve and praise them and out of Our Apostolic goodness to make other
   provision in the premisses.

   We, therefore, have caused these instructions and Exercises to be
   examined, and by the testimony of and report made to Us by Our beloved
   son John Cardinal Priest of the Title of St. Clement, Bishop of Burgos
   and Inquisitor, Our venerable Brother Philip, Bishop of Saluciae, and
   Our Vicar General in things spiritual at Rome, and Our beloved son
   Aegidius Foscararius, Master of Our Sacred Palace, have found that
   these Exercises are full of piety and holiness and that they are and
   will be extremely useful and salutary for the spiritual profit of the
   faithful.

   We have, besides, as We should, due regard to the rich fruits which
   Ignatius and the aforesaid Society founded by him are constantly
   producing everywhere in the Church of God, and to the very great help
   which the said Exercises have proved in this.

   Moved, then, by this petition, with the aforesaid authority, by these
   presents, and of Our certain knowledge, We approve, praise, and favor
   with the present writing the aforesaid instructions and Exercises and
   all and everything contained in them, and We earnestly exhort all and
   each of the faithful of both sexes everywhere to employ instructions
   and Exercises so pious and to be instructed by them.

   [Here follow regulations for the diffusion of the book, and then
   confirmatory clauses.]

   Given at St. Mark's in Rome under the seal of the Fisherman, 31 July,
   1548, in the 14th year of Our Pontificate.

                                    PREFACE

   THE present translation of the Exercises of St. Ignatius has been made
   from the Spanish Autograph of St. Ignatius. The copy so designated is
   not indeed in the handwriting of the Saint, but has a good number of
   corrections made by him and is known to have been used by him in giving
   the Exercises.

   St. Ignatius of Loyola was a man without any great pretensions to
   education at the time he wrote this book. His native language was not
   Spanish, but Basque. His lack of education and his imperfect
   acquaintance with pure Spanish are enough to make it clear that a
   refined use of any language, and more especially of the Spanish, or, in
   general, anything like a finished or even perfectly correct, style is
   not to be expected in his work. Literary defects he removed to some
   extent, perhaps, as he continued to use and apply the book, but he is
   known never to have been fearful of such faults. His corrections found
   in this text are clearly made with a view to precision more than to
   anything else.

   The Autograph of St. Ignatius was translated by Father General Roothaan
   into Latin and was reproduced by Father Rodeles in his edition of the
   Spanish text. But the original was not available to ordinary students.
   In 1908, however, Father General Wernz allowed the entire book to be
   phototyped, and in this way it was spread throughout the Society of
   Jesus in a large number of copies. It is one of these which has been
   chiefly employed by the present translator, who has, besides, made
   frequent use of the Manuscript itself.

   After considerable study of the matter, it seemed best to make this
   translation as faithful and close a reproduction of the Spanish text as
   could be. To do so it was necessary at times to sacrifice the niceties
   of style, but it was thought that those who would use the book would
   easily forego the elegancies of diction if they could feel sure they
   were reading the very words of St. Ignatius. Any other form of
   translation than the one adopted could hardly be kept from being a
   partial expansion, illustration or development of the original, and
   would therefore have proved, to some extent, a commentary as well as a
   translation. This the translator has earnestly sought to avoid,
   preferring to leave the further work of commentary to another occasion
   or to other hands.

   Another reason for aiming at absolute fidelity rather than style was
   the fact that the Exercises are mostly read, not continuously for any
   time, but piecemeal and meditatively. Literary finish would therefore
   not be much sought or cared for in the book, but accuracy is. For this
   a certain neglect of style seemed pardonable in the translation, if
   only the real meaning of the writer could be made clear. Perhaps some
   may even find a charm in the consequent want of finish, seeing it
   reproduces more completely the style of St. Ignatius.

   The process of translating in this way the Autograph text is not as
   simple as it might seem. The first difficulty is to make sure of the
   exact meaning of St. Ignatius. This is obscured, at times, by his
   language being that of nearly 400 years ago and being not pure Spanish.
   Occasionally, in fact, the Saint makes new Spanish words from the Latin
   or Italian, or uses Spanish words in an Italian or Latin sense, or
   employs phrases not current except in the Schools, and sometimes even
   has recourse to words in their Latin form. To be sure, then, of the
   meaning, one must often go to other languages and to the terms adopted
   in Scholastic Philosophy or Theology. The meaning clear, the further
   difficulty comes of finding an exactly equivalent English word or
   phrase.

   In accomplishing his task, the translator has made free use of other
   translations, especially of that of Father General Roothaan into Latin,
   that of Father Venturi into Italian, and that of Father Jennesseaux
   into French, and has had the use of the literal translation into Latin
   made, apparently, by St. Ignatius himself, copied in 1541, and formally
   approved by the Holy See in 1548.

   Besides the last-mentioned Manuscript and printed books, the translator
   has to acknowledge, as he does very gratefully, his obligations to the
   Very Rev. Father Mathias Abad, Father Achilles Gerste and particularly
   Father Mariano Lecina, Editor of the Ignatiana in the Monumenta
   Historica S.J., for aid in appreciating the Spanish text, to Fathers
   Michael Ahern, Peter Cusick, Walter Drum, Francis Kemper and Herbert
   Noonan for general revision of the translation, and above all to Father
   Aloysius Frumveller for an accurate collation of the translation with
   the original.

   In conclusion, it is well to warn the reader that the Spiritual
   Exercises of St. Ignatius are not meant to be read cursorily, but to be
   pondered word for word and under the direction of a competent guide.
   Read straight on, it may well appear jejune and unsatisfactory; studied
   in the actual making of the Exercises, the very text itself cannot fail
   to yield ever new material for thought and prayer.

                                  GENERAL NOTE

   In the reproduction of the text in English:

   1. No change whatever is made in the wording. The proper corrections,
   however, of the two unimportant slips in quotation have been indicated
   in italics.

   It may be remarked in passing that the text of Holy Scripture is not
   seldom given in the Spiritual Exercises in wording somewhat different
   from that of the Vulgate. Such divergences have not been noted in this
   translation. It will be remembered that, when the book was written, the
   Council of Trent had not yet put its seal on the Vulgate.

   2. The head lines and the rubrics have been kept as they stand in the
   Manuscript. Where they were wanting, they have been supplied in
   italics.

   3. Abbreviations have been filled out.

   4. Wherever italics are used, the words in this character belong to the
   translator and not to St. Ignatius.

   5. In the use of small and capital letters, and in the matter of
   punctuation and the division into paragraphs the practice of the
   copyist has usually not been followed. Various kinds of type, also, are
   used independently of the Manuscript.

   6. As a matter of convenience, in citations from Holy Scripture, the
   modern method by chapter and verse is substituted for that of the Mss.
   chapter and letter. Besides, quotations are indicated by quotation
   marks in place of the parentheses of the Mss.

  OF FATHER DIERTINS

   ROUSE up, O Lord, and foster the spirit of the Exercises which Blessed
   Ignatius labored to spread abroad, that we, too, may be filled with it
   and be zealous to love what he loved and do what he taught! Through
   Christ our Lord.

   Amen.

                      SPIRITUAL EXERCISES OF ST. IGNATIUS

                                      IHS
     __________________________________________________________________

                                  ANNOTATIONS

        TO GIVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPIRITUAL EXERCISES WHICH FOLLOW, AND
        TO ENABLE HIM WHO IS TO GIVE AND HIM WHO IS TO RECEIVE THEM TO HELP
        THEMSELVES

   First Annotation. The first Annotation is that by this name of
   Spiritual Exercises is meant every way of examining one's conscience,
   of meditating, of contemplating, of praying vocally and mentally, and
   of performing other spiritual actions, as will be said later. For as
   strolling, walking and running are bodily exercises, so every way of
   preparing and disposing the soul to rid itself of all the disordered
   tendencies, and, after it is rid, to seek and find the Divine Will as
   to the management of one's life for the salvation of the soul, is
   called a Spiritual Exercise.

   Second Annotation. [1] The second is that the person who gives to
   another the way and order in which to meditate or contemplate, ought to
   relate faithfully the events of such Contemplation or Meditation, going
   over the Points with only a short or summary development. For, if the
   person who is making the Contemplation, takes the true groundwork of
   the narrative, and, discussing and considering for himself, finds
   something which makes the events a little clearer or brings them a
   little more home to him--whether this comes through his own reasoning,
   or because his intellect is enlightened by the Divine power--he will
   get more spiritual relish and fruit, than if he who is giving the
   Exercises had much explained and amplified the meaning of the events.
   For it is not knowing much, but realising and relishing things
   interiorly, that contents and satisfies the soul.

   Third Annotation. The third: As in all the following Spiritual
   Exercises, we use acts of the intellect in reasoning, and acts of the
   will in movements of the feelings: let us remark that, in the acts of
   the will, when we are speaking vocally or mentally with God our Lord,
   or with His Saints, greater reverence is required on our part than when
   we are using the intellect in understanding.

   Fourth Annotation. The fourth: The following Exercises are divided into
   four parts:

   First, the consideration and contemplation on the sins;

   Second, the life of Christ our Lord up to Palm Sunday inclusively;

   Third, the Passion of Christ our Lord;

   Fourth, the Resurrection and Ascension, with the three Methods of
   Prayer.

   Though four weeks, to correspond to this division, are spent in the
   Exercises, it is not to be understood that each Week has, of necessity,
   seven or eight days. For, as it happens that in the First Week some are
   slower to find what they seek--namely, contrition, sorrow and tears for
   their sins--and in the same way some are more diligent than others, and
   more acted on or tried by different spirits; it is necessary sometimes
   to shorten the Week, and at other times to lengthen it. The same is
   true of all the other subsequent Weeks, seeking out the things
   according to the subject matter. However, the Exercises will be
   finished in thirty days, a little more or less.

   Fifth Annotation. The fifth: It is very helpful to him who is receiving
   the Exercises to enter into them with great courage and generosity
   towards his Creator and Lord, offering [2] Him all his will and
   liberty, that His Divine Majesty may make use of his person and of all
   he has according [3] to His most Holy Will.

   Sixth Annotation. The sixth: When he who is giving the Exercises sees
   that no spiritual movements, such as consolations or desolations, come
   to the soul of him who is exercising himself, and that he is not moved
   by different spirits, he ought to inquire carefully of him about the
   Exercises, whether he does them at their appointed times, and how. So
   too of the Additions, whether he observes them with diligence. Let him
   ask in detail about each of these things.

   Consolation and desolation are spoken of on p. 170; the Additions on p.
   22.

   Seventh Annotation. The seventh: If he who is giving the Exercises sees
   that he who is receiving them is in desolation and tempted, let him not
   be hard or dissatisfied with him, but gentle and indulgent, giving him
   courage and strength for the future, and laying bare to him the wiles
   of the enemy of human nature, and getting him to prepare and dispose
   himself for the consolation coming.

   Eighth Annotation. The eighth: If he who is giving the Exercises sees
   that he who is receiving them is in need of instruction about the
   desolations and wiles of the enemy--and the same of consolations--he
   may explain to him, as far as he needs them, the Rules of the First and
   Second Weeks for recognising different spirits. (P. 177).

   Ninth Annotation. The ninth is to notice, when he who is exercising
   himself is in the Exercises of the First Week, if he is a person who
   has not been versed in spiritual things, and is tempted grossly and
   openly--having, for example, suggested to him obstacles to going on in
   the service of God our Lord, such as labors, shame and fear for the
   honor of the world--let him who is giving the Exercises not explain to
   him the Rules of the Second Week for the discernment of spirits.
   Because, as much as those of the First Week will be helpful, those of
   the Second will be harmful to him, as being matter too subtle and too
   high for him to understand.

   Tenth Annotation. The tenth: When he who is giving the Exercises
   perceives that he who is receiving them is assaulted and tempted under
   the appearance of good, then it is proper to instruct him about the
   Rules of the Second Week already mentioned. For, ordinarily, the enemy
   of human nature tempts under the appearance of good rather when the
   person is exercising himself in the Illuminative Life, which
   corresponds to the Exercises of the Second Week, and not so much in the
   Purgative Life, which corresponds to those of the First.

   Eleventh Annotation. The eleventh: It is helpful to him who is
   receiving the Exercises in the First Week, not to know anything of what
   he is to do in the Second, but so to labor in the First to attain the
   object he is seeking as if he did not hope to find in the Second any
   good.

   Twelfth Annotation. The twelfth: As he who is receiving the Exercises
   is to give an hour to each of the five Exercises or Contemplations
   which will be made every day, he who is giving the Exercises has to
   warn him carefully to always see that his soul remains content in the
   consciousness of having been a full hour in the Exercise, and rather
   more than less. For the enemy is not a little used to try and make one
   cut short the hour of such contemplation, meditation or prayer.

   Thirteenth Annotation. The thirteenth: It is likewise to be remarked
   that, as, in the time of consolation, it is easy and not irksome to be
   in contemplation the full hour, so it is very hard in the time of
   desolation to fill it out. For this reason, the person who is
   exercising himself, in order to act against the desolation and conquer
   the temptations, ought always to stay somewhat more than the full hour;
   so as to accustom himself not only to resist the adversary, but even to
   overthrow him.

   Fourteenth Annotation. The fourteenth: If he who is giving the
   Exercises sees that he who is receiving them is going on in consolation
   and with much fervor, he ought to warn him not to make any
   inconsiderate and hasty promise or vow: and the more light of character
   he knows him to be, the more he ought to warn and admonish him. For,
   though one may justly influence another to embrace the religious life,
   in which he is understood to make vows of obedience, poverty and
   chastity, and, although a good work done under vow is more meritorious
   than one done without it, one should carefully consider the
   circumstances and personal qualities of the individual and how much
   help or hindrance he is likely to find in fulfilling the thing he would
   want to promise.

   Fifteenth Annotation. The fifteenth: He who is giving the Exercises
   ought not to influence him who is receiving them more to poverty or to
   a promise, than to their opposites, nor more to one state or way of
   life than to another. For though, outside the Exercises, we can
   lawfully and with merit influence every one who is probably fit to
   choose continence, virginity, the religious life and all manner of
   evangelical perfection, still in the Spiritual Exercises, when seeking
   the Divine Will, it is more fitting and much better, that the Creator
   and Lord Himself should communicate Himself to His devout soul,
   inflaming it with His love and praise, and disposing it for the way in
   which it will be better able to serve Him in future. So, he who is
   giving the Exercises should not turn or incline to one side or the
   other, but standing in the centre like a balance, leave the Creator to
   act immediately with the creature, and the creature with its Creator
   and Lord.

   Sixteenth Annotation. The sixteenth: For this--namely, that the Creator
   and Lord may work more surely in His creature--it is very expedient, if
   it happens that the soul is attached or inclined to a thing
   inordinately, that one should move himself, putting forth all his
   strength, to come to the contrary of what he is wrongly drawn to. Thus
   if he inclines to seeking and possessing an office or benefice, not for
   the honor and glory of God our Lord, nor for the spiritual well-being
   of souls, but for his own temporal advantage and interests, he ought to
   excite his feelings to the contrary, being instant in prayers and other
   spiritual exercises, and asking God our Lord for the contrary, namely,
   not to want such office or benefice, or any other thing, unless His
   Divine Majesty, putting his desires in order, change his first
   inclination for him, so that the motive for desiring or having one
   thing or another be only the service, honor, and glory of His Divine
   Majesty.

   Seventeenth Annotation. The seventeenth: It is very helpful that he who
   is giving the Exercises, without wanting to ask or know from him who is
   receiving them his personal thoughts or sins, should be faithfully
   informed of the various movements and thoughts which the different
   spirits put in him. For, according as is more or less useful for him,
   he can give him some spiritual Exercises suited and adapted to the need
   of such a soul so acted upon.

   Eighteenth Annotation. The eighteenth: The Spiritual Exercises have to
   be adapted to the dispositions of the persons who wish to receive them,
   that is, to their age, education or ability, in order not to give to
   one who is uneducated or of little intelligence things he cannot easily
   bear and profit by.

   Again, that should be given to each one by which, according to his wish
   to dispose himself, he may be better able to help himself and to
   profit.

   So, to him who wants help to be instructed and to come to a certain
   degree of contentment of soul, can be given the Particular Examen, p.
   21, and then the General Examen, p. 25; also, for a half hour in the
   morning, the Method of Prayer on the Commandments, the Deadly Sins,
   etc., p. 125. Let him be recommended, also, to confess his sins every
   eight days, and, if he can, to receive the Blessed Sacrament every
   fifteen days, and better, if he be so moved, every eight. This way is
   more proper for illiterate or less educated persons. Let each of the
   Commandments be explained to them; and so of the Deadly Sins, Precepts
   of the Church, Five Senses, and Works of Mercy.

   So, too, should he who is giving the Exercises observe that he who is
   receiving them has little ability or little natural capacity, from whom
   not much fruit is to be hoped, it is more expedient to give him some of
   these easy Exercises, until he confesses his sins. Then let him be
   given some Examens of Conscience and some method for going to
   Confession oftener than was his custom, in order to preserve what he
   has gained, but let him not go on into the matter of the Election, or
   into any other Exercises that are outside the First Week, especially
   when more progress can be made in other persons and there is not time
   for every thing.

   Nineteenth Annotation. The nineteenth: A person of education or ability
   who is taken up with public affairs or suitable business, may take an
   hour and a half daily to exercise himself.

   Let the end for which man is created be explained to him, and he can
   also be given for the space of a half-hour the Particular Examen and
   then the General and the way to confess and to receive the Blessed
   Sacrament. Let him, during three days every morning, for the space of
   an hour, make the meditation on the First, Second and Third Sins, pp.
   37, 38; then, three other days at the same hour, the meditation on the
   statement of Sins, p. 40; then, for three other days at the same hour,
   on the punishments corresponding to Sins, p. 45. Let him be given in
   all three meditations the ten Additions, p. 47.

   For the mysteries of Christ our Lord, let the same course be kept, as
   is explained below and in full in the Exercises themselves.

   Twentieth Annotation. The twentieth: To him who is more disengaged, and
   who desires to get all the profit he can, let all the Spiritual
   Exercises be given in the order in which they follow.

   In these he will, ordinarily, more benefit himself, the more he
   separates himself from all friends and acquaintances and from all
   earthly care, as by changing from the house where he was dwelling, and
   taking another house or room to live in, in as much privacy as he can,
   so that it be in his power to go each day to Mass and to Vespers,
   without fear that his acquaintances will put obstacles in his way.

   From this isolation three chief benefits, among many others, follow.

   The first is that a man, by separating himself from many friends and
   acquaintances, and likewise from many not well-ordered affairs, to
   serve and praise God our Lord, merits no little in the sight of His
   Divine Majesty.

   The second is, that being thus isolated, and not having his
   understanding divided on many things, but concentrating his care on one
   only, namely, on serving his Creator and benefiting his own soul, he
   uses with greater freedom his natural powers, in seeking with diligence
   what he so much desires.

   The third: the more our soul finds itself alone and isolated, the more
   apt it makes itself to approach and to reach its Creator and Lord, and
   the more it so approaches Him, the more it disposes itself to receive
   graces and gifts from His Divine and Sovereign Goodness.

                                 PRESUPPOSITION

   In order that both he who is giving the Spiritual Exercises, and he who
   is receiving them, may more help and benefit themselves, let it be
   presupposed that every good Christian is to be more ready to save his
   neighbor's proposition than to condemn it. If he cannot save it, let
   him inquire how he means it; and if he means it badly, let him correct
   him with charity. If that is not enough, let him seek all the suitable
   means to bring him to mean it well, and save himself.

                                   FIRST WEEK
     __________________________________________________________________

PRINCIPLE AND FOUNDATION

   Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God our Lord, and by
   this means to save his soul.

   And the other things on the face of the earth are created for man and
   that they may help him in prosecuting the end for which he is created.

   From this it follows that man is to use them as much as they help him
   on to his end, and ought to rid himself of them so far as they hinder
   him as to it.

   For this it is necessary to make ourselves indifferent to all created
   things in all that is allowed to the choice of our free will and is not
   prohibited to it; so that, on our part, we want not health rather than
   sickness, riches rather than poverty, honor rather than dishonor, long
   rather than short life, and so in all the rest; desiring and choosing
   only what is most conducive for us to the end for which we are created.
     __________________________________________________________________

PARTICULAR AND DAILY EXAMEN

   It contains in it three times, and two to examine oneself.

   The first time is in the morning, immediately on rising, when one ought
   to propose to guard himself with diligence against that particular sin
   or defect which he wants to correct and amend.

   The second time is after dinner, when one is to ask of God our Lord
   what one wants, namely, grace to remember how many times he has fallen
   into that particular sin or defect, and to amend himself in the future.
   Then let him make the first Examen, asking account of his soul of that
   particular thing proposed, which he wants to correct and amend. Let him
   go over hour by hour, or period by period, commencing at the hour he
   rose, and continuing up to the hour and instant of the present examen,
   and let him make in the first line of the G------- as many dots as were
   the times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect. Then let
   him resolve anew to amend himself up to the second Examen which he will
   make.

   The third time: After supper, the second Examen will be made, in the
   same way, hour by hour, commencing at the first Examen and continuing
   up to the present (second) one, and let him make in the second line of
   the same G------- as many dots as were the times he has fallen into
   that particular sin or defect.

  FOUR ADDITIONS

  FOLLOW TO RID ONESELF SOONER OF THAT PARTICULAR SIN OR DEFECT

   First Addition. The first Addition is that each time one falls into
   that particular sin or defect, let him put his hand on his breast,
   grieving for having fallen: which can be done even in the presence of
   many, without their perceiving what he is doing.

   Second Addition. The second: As the first line of the G------- means
   the first Examen, and the second line the second Examen, let him look
   at night if there is amendment from the first line to the second, that
   is, from the first Examen to the second.

   Third Addition. The third: To compare the second day with the first;
   that is, the two Examens of the present day with the other two Examens
   of the previous day, and see if he has amended himself from one day to
   the other.

   Fourth Addition. The fourth Addition: To compare one week with another,
   and see if he has amended himself in the present week over the week
   past.

   Note. It is to be noted that the first (large) G------- which follows
   means the Sunday: the second (smaller), the Monday: the third, the
   Tuesday, and so on.

GENERAL EXAMEN OF CONSCIENCE

  TO PURIFY ONESELF AND TO MAKE ONE'S CONFESSION BETTER

   I presuppose that there are three kinds of thoughts in me: that is, one
   my own, which springs from my mere liberty and will; and two others,
   which come from without, one from the good spirit, and the other from
   the bad.

  THOUGHT

   There are two ways of meriting in the bad thought which comes from
   without, namely:

   First Way. A thought of committing a mortal sin, which thought I resist
   immediately and it remains conquered.

   Second Way. The second way of meriting is: When that same bad thought
   comes to me and I resist it, and it returns to me again and again, and
   I always resist, until it is conquered.

   This second way is more meritorious than the first.

   A venial sin is committed when the same thought comes of sinning
   mortally and one gives ear to it, making some little delay, or
   receiving some sensual pleasure, or when there is some negligence in
   rejecting such thought.

   There are two ways of sinning mortally:

   First Way. The first is, when one gives consent to the bad thought, to
   act afterwards as he has consented, or to put it in act if he could.

   Second Way. The second way of sinning mortally is when that sin is put
   in act.

   This is a greater sin for three reasons: first, because of the greater
   time; second, because of the greater intensity; third, because of the
   greater harm to the two persons.

  WORD

   One must not swear, either by Creator or creature, if it be not with
   truth, necessity and reverence.

   By necessity I mean, not when any truth whatever is affirmed with oath,
   but when it is of some importance for the good of the soul, or the
   body, or for temporal goods.

   By reverence I mean when, in naming the Creator and Lord, one acts with
   consideration, so as to render Him the honor and reverence due.

   It is to be noted that, though in an idle oath one sins more when he
   swears by the Creator than by the creature, it is more difficult to
   swear in the right way with truth, necessity and reverence by the
   creature than by the Creator, for the following reasons.

   First Reason. The first: When we want to swear by some creature,
   wanting to name the creature does not make us so attentive or
   circumspect as to telling the truth, or as to affirming it with
   necessity, as would wanting to name the Lord and Creator of all things.

   Second Reason. The second is that in swearing by the creature it is not
   so easy to show reverence and respect to the Creator, as in swearing
   and naming the same Creator and Lord, because wanting to name God our
   Lord brings with it more respect and reverence than wanting to name the
   created thing. Therefore swearing by the creature is more allowable to
   the perfect than to the imperfect, because the perfect, through
   continued contemplation and enlightenment of intellect, consider,
   meditate and contemplate more that God our Lord is in every creature,
   according to His own essence, presence and power, and so in swearing by
   the creature they are more apt and prepared than the imperfect to show
   respect and reverence to their Creator and Lord.

   Third Reason. The third is that in continually swearing by the
   creature, idolatry is to be more feared in the imperfect than in the
   perfect.

   One must not speak an idle word. By idle word I mean one which does not
   benefit either me or another, and is not directed to that intention.
   Hence words spoken for any useful purpose, or meant to profit one's own
   or another's soul, the body or temporal goods, are never idle, not even
   if one were to speak of something foreign to one's state of life, as,
   for instance, if a religious speaks of wars or articles of trade; but
   in all that is said there is merit in directing well, and sin in
   directing badly, or in speaking idly.

   Nothing must be said to injure another's character or to find fault,
   because if I reveal a mortal sin that is not public, I sin mortally; if
   a venial sin, venially; and if a defect, I show a defect of my own.

   But if the intention is right, in two ways one can speak of the sin or
   fault of another:

   First Way. The first: When the sin is public, as in the case of a
   public prostitute, and of a sentence given in judgment, or of a public
   error which is infecting the souls with whom one comes in contact.

   Second Way. Second: When the hidden sin is revealed to some person that
   he may help to raise him who is in sin--supposing, however, that he has
   some probable conjectures or grounds for thinking that he will be able
   to help him.

  ACT

   Taking the Ten Commandments, the Precepts of the Church and the
   recommendations of Superiors, every act done against any of these three
   heads is, according to its greater or less nature, a greater or a
   lesser sin.

   By recommendations of Superiors I mean such things as Bulls de Cruzadas
   and other Indulgences, as for instance for peace, granted under
   condition of going to Confession and receiving the Blessed Sacrament.
   For one commits no little sin in being the cause of others acting
   contrary to such pious exhortations and recommendations of our
   Superiors, or in doing so oneself.

  METHOD FOR MAKING THE GENERAL EXAMEN

   It contains in it five Points.

   First Point. The first Point is to give thanks to God our Lord for the
   benefits received.

   Second Point. The second, to ask grace to know our sins and cast them
   out.

   Third Point. The third, to ask account of our soul from the hour that
   we rose up to the present Examen, hour by hour, or period by period:
   and first as to thoughts, and then as to words, and then as to acts, in
   the same order as was mentioned in the Particular Examen.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to ask pardon of God our Lord for the faults.

   Fifth Point. The fifth, to purpose amendment with His grace.

   Our Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

GENERAL CONFESSION WITH COMMUNION

   Whoever, of his own accord, wants to make a General Confession, will,
   among many other advantages, find three in making it here.

   First. The first: Though whoever goes to Confession every year is not
   obliged to make a General Confession, by making it there is greater
   profit and merit, because of the greater actual sorrow for all the sins
   and wickedness of his whole life.

   Second. The second: In the Spiritual Exercises, sins and their malice
   are understood more intimately, than in the time when one was not so
   giving himself to interior things. Gaining now more knowledge of and
   sorrow for them, he will have greater profit and merit than he had
   before.

   Third. The third is: In consequence, having made a better Confession
   and being better disposed, one finds himself in condition and prepared
   to receive the Blessed Sacrament: the reception of which is an aid not
   only not to fall into sin, but also to preserve the increase of grace.

   This General Confession will be best made immediately after the
   Exercises of the First Week.
     __________________________________________________________________

FIRST EXERCISE

  IT IS A MEDITATION WITH THE THREE POWERS ON THE FIRST, THE SECOND AND THE
  THIRD SIN

   It contains in it, after one Preparatory Prayer and two Preludes, three
   chief Points and one Colloquy.

   Prayer. The Preparatory Prayer is to ask grace of God our Lord that all
   my intentions, actions and operations may be directed purely to the
   service and praise of His Divine Majesty.

   First Prelude. The First Prelude is a composition, seeing the place.

   Here it is to be noted that, in a visible contemplation or
   meditation--as, for instance, when one contemplates Christ our Lord,
   Who is visible--the composition will be to see with the sight of the
   imagination the corporeal place where the thing is found which I want
   to contemplate. I say the corporeal place, as for instance, a Temple or
   Mountain where Jesus Christ or Our Lady is found, according to what I
   want to contemplate. In an invisible contemplation or meditation--as
   here on the Sins--the composition will be to see with the sight of the
   imagination and consider that my soul is imprisoned in this corruptible
   body, and all the compound in this valley, as exiled among brute
   beasts: I say all the compound of soul and body.

   Second Prelude. The second is to ask God our Lord for what I want and
   desire.

   The petition has to be according to the subject matter; that is, if the
   contemplation is on the Resurrection, one is to ask for joy with Christ
   in joy; if it is on the Passion, he is to ask for pain, tears and
   torment with Christ in torment.

   Here it will be to ask shame and confusion at myself, seeing how many
   have been damned for only one mortal sin, and how many times I deserved
   to be condemned forever for my so many sins.

   Note. Before all Contemplations or Meditations, there ought always to
   be made the Preparatory Prayer, which is not changed, and the two
   Preludes already mentioned, which are sometimes changed, according to
   the subject matter.

   First Point. The first Point will be to bring the memory on the First
   Sin, which was that of the Angels, and then to bring the intellect on
   the same, discussing it; then the will, wanting to recall and
   understand all this in order to make me more ashamed and confound me
   more, bringing into comparison with the one sin of the Angels my so
   many sins, and reflecting, while they for one sin were cast into Hell,
   how often I have deserved it for so many.

   I say to bring to memory the sin of the Angels, how they, being created
   in grace, not wanting to help themselves with their liberty to
   reverence and obey their Creator and Lord, coming to pride, were
   changed from grace to malice, and hurled from Heaven to Hell; and so
   then to discuss more in detail with the intellect: and then to move the
   feelings more with the will.

   Second Point. The second is to do the same--that is, to bring the Three
   Powers--on the sin of Adam and Eve, bringing to memory how on account
   of that sin they did penance for so long a time, and how much
   corruption came on the human race, so many people going the way to
   Hell.

   I say to bring to memory the Second Sin, that of our First Parents; how
   after Adam was created in the field of Damascus and placed in the
   Terrestrial Paradise, and Eve was created from his rib, being forbidden
   to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, they ate and so sinned, and afterwards
   clothed in tunics of skins and cast from Paradise, they lived, all
   their life, without the original justice which they had lost, and in
   many labors and much penance. And then to discuss with the
   understanding more in detail; and to use the will as has been said.

   Third Point. The third is likewise to do the same on the Third
   particular Sin of any one who for one mortal sin is gone to Hell--and
   many others without number, for fewer sins than I have committed.

   I say to do the same on the Third particular Sin, bringing to memory
   the gravity and malice of the sin against one's Creator and Lord; to
   discuss with the understanding how in sinning and acting against the
   Infinite Goodness, he has been justly condemned forever; and to finish
   with the will as has been said.

   Colloquy. Imagining Christ our Lord present and placed on the Cross,
   let me make a Colloquy, how from Creator He is come to making Himself
   man, and from life eternal is come to temporal death, and so to die for
   my sins.

   Likewise, looking at myself, what I have done for Christ, what I am
   doing for Christ, what I ought to do for Christ.

   And so, seeing Him such, and so nailed on the Cross, to go over that
   which will present itself.

   The Colloquy is made, properly speaking, as one friend speaks to
   another, or as a servant to his master; now asking some grace, now
   blaming oneself for some misdeed, now communicating one's affairs, and
   asking advice in them.

   And let me say an Our Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

SECOND EXERCISE

   IT IS A MEDITATION ON THE SINS AND CONTAINS IN IT AFTER THE PREPARATORY
   PRAYER AND TWO PRELUDES, FIVE POINTS AND ONE COLLOQUY

   Prayer. Let the Preparatory Prayer be the same.

   First Prelude. The First Prelude will be the same composition.

   Second Prelude. The second is to ask for what I want. It will be here
   to beg a great and intense sorrow and tears for my sins.

   First Point. The first Point is the statement of the sins; that is to
   say, to bring to memory all the sins of life, looking from year to
   year, or from period to period. For this three things are helpful:
   first, to look at the place and the house where I have lived; second,
   the relations I have had with others; third, the occupation in which I
   have lived.

   Second Point. The second, to weigh the sins, looking at the foulness
   and the malice which any mortal sin committed has in it, even supposing
   it were not forbidden.

   Third Point. The third, to look at who I am, lessening myself by
   examples:

   First, how much I am in comparison to all men;

   Second, what men are in comparison to all the Angels and Saints of
   Paradise;

   Third, what all Creation is in comparison to God: (--Then I alone, what
   can I be?)

   Fourth, to see all my bodily corruption and foulness;

   Fifth, to look at myself as a sore and ulcer, from which have sprung so
   many sins and so many iniquities and so very vile poison.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to consider what God is, against Whom I have
   sinned, according to His attributes; comparing them with their
   contraries in me--His Wisdom with my ignorance; His Omnipotence with my
   weakness; His Justice with my iniquity; His Goodness with my malice.

   Fifth Point. The fifth, an exclamation of wonder with deep feeling,
   going through all creatures, how they have left me in life and
   preserved me in it; the Angels, how, though they are the sword of the
   Divine Justice, they have endured me, and guarded me, and prayed for
   me; the Saints, how they have been engaged in interceding and praying
   for me; and the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and elements, fruits, birds,
   fishes and animals--and the earth, how it has not opened to swallow me
   up, creating new Hells for me to suffer in them forever!

   Colloquy. Let me finish with a Colloquy of mercy, pondering and giving
   thanks to God our Lord that He has given me life up to now, proposing
   amendment, with His grace, for the future.

   Our Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

THIRD EXERCISE

   IT IS A REPETITION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND EXERCISE, MAKING THREE
   COLLOQUIES

   After the Preparatory Prayer and two Preludes, it will be to repeat the
   First and Second Exercise, marking and dwelling on the Points in which
   I have felt greater consolation or desolation, or greater spiritual
   feeling.

   After this I will make three Colloquies in the following manner:

   First Colloquy. The first Colloquy to Our Lady, that she may get me
   grace from Her Son and Lord for three things: first, that I may feel an
   interior knowledge of my sins, and hatred of them; second, that I may
   feel the disorder of my actions, so that, hating them, I may correct
   myself and put myself in order; third, to ask knowledge of the world,
   in order that, hating it, I may put away from me worldly and vain
   things.

   And with that a Hail Mary.

   Second Colloquy. The second: The same to the Son, begging Him to get it
   for me from the Father.

   And with that the Soul of Christ.

   Third Colloquy. The third: The same to the Father, that the Eternal
   Lord Himself may grant it to me.

   And with that an Our Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

FOURTH EXERCISE

  IT IS A SUMMARY OF THIS SAME THIRD

   I said a summary, that the understanding, without wandering, may
   assiduously go through the memory of the things contemplated in the
   preceding Exercises.

   I will make the same three Colloquies.
     __________________________________________________________________

FIFTH EXERCISE

  IT IS A MEDITATION ON HELL

   It contains in it, after the Preparatory Prayer and two Preludes, five
   Points and one Colloquy:

   Prayer. Let the Preparatory Prayer be the usual one.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is the composition, which is here to
   see with the sight of the imagination the length, breadth and depth of
   Hell.

   Second Prelude. The second, to ask for what I want: it will be here to
   ask for interior sense of the pain which the damned suffer, in order
   that, if, through my faults, I should forget the love of the Eternal
   Lord, at least the fear of the pains may help me not to come into sin.

   First Point. The first Point will be to see with the sight of the
   imagination the great fires, and the souls as in bodies of fire.

   Second Point. The second, to hear with the ears wailings, howlings,
   cries, blasphemies against Christ our Lord and against all His Saints.

   Third Point. The third, to smell with the smell smoke, sulphur, dregs
   and putrid things.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to taste with the taste bitter things, like
   tears, sadness and the worm of conscience.

   Fifth Point. The fifth, to touch with the touch; that is to say, how
   the fires touch and burn the souls.

   Colloquy. Making a Colloquy to Christ our Lord, I will bring to memory
   the souls that are in Hell, some because they did not believe the
   Coming, others because, believing, they did not act according to His
   Commandments; making three divisions:

   First, Second, and Third Divisions. The first, before the Coming; the
   second, during His life; the third, after His life in this world; and
   with this I will give Him thanks that He has not let me fall into any
   of these divisions, ending my life.

   Likewise, I will consider how up to now He has always had so great pity
   and mercy on me.

   I will end with an Our Father.

   Note. The first Exercise will be made at midnight; the second
   immediately on rising in the morning; the third, before or after Mass;
   in any case, before dinner; the fourth at the hour of Vespers; the
   fifth, an hour before supper.

   This arrangement of hours, more or less, I always mean in all the four
   Weeks, according as his age, disposition and physical condition help
   the person who is exercising himself to make five Exercises or fewer.
     __________________________________________________________________

ADDITIONS

  TO MAKE THE EXERCISES BETTER AND TO FIND BETTER WHAT ONE DESIRES

   First Addition. The first Addition is, after going to bed, just when I
   want to go asleep, to think, for the space of a Hail Mary, of the hour
   that I have to rise and for what, making a resume of the Exercise which
   I have to make.

   Second Addition. The second: When I wake up, not giving place to any
   other thought, to turn my attention immediately to what I am going to
   contemplate in the first Exercise, at midnight, bringing myself to
   confusion for my so many sins, setting examples, as, for instance, if a
   knight found himself before his king and all his court, ashamed and
   confused at having much offended him, from whom he had first received
   many gifts and many favors: in the same way, in the second Exercise,
   making myself a great sinner and in chains; that is to say going to
   appear bound as in chains before the Supreme Eternal Judge; taking for
   an example how prisoners in chains and already deserving death, appear
   before their temporal judge. And I will dress with these thoughts or
   with others, according to the subject matter.

   Third Addition. The third: A step or two before the place where I have
   to contemplate or meditate, I will put myself standing for the space of
   an Our Father, my intellect raised on high, considering how God our
   Lord is looking at me, etc.; and will make an act of reverence or
   humility.

   Fourth Addition. The fourth: To enter on the contemplation now on my
   knees, now prostrate on the earth, now lying face upwards, now seated,
   now standing, always intent on seeking what I want.

   We will attend to two things. The first is, that if I find what I want
   kneeling, I will not pass on; and if prostrate, likewise, etc. The
   second; in the Point in which I find what I want, there I will rest,
   without being anxious to pass on, until I content myself.

   Fifth Addition. The fifth: After finishing the Exercise, I will, during
   the space of a quarter of an hour, seated or walking leisurely, look
   how it went with me in the Contemplation or Meditation; and if badly, I
   will look for the cause from which it proceeds, and having so seen it,
   will be sorry, in order to correct myself in future; and if well, I
   will give thanks to God our Lord, and will do in like manner another
   time.

   Sixth Addition. The sixth: Not to want to think on things of pleasure
   or joy, such as heavenly glory, the Resurrection, etc. Because whatever
   consideration of joy and gladness hinders our feeling pain and grief
   and shedding tears for our sins: but to keep before me that I want to
   grieve and feel pain, bringing to memory rather Death and Judgment.

   Seventh Addition. The seventh: For the same end, to deprive myself of
   all light, closing the blinds and doors while I am in the room, if it
   be not to recite prayers, to read and eat.

   Eighth Addition. The eighth: Not to laugh nor say a thing provocative
   of laughter.

   Ninth Addition. The ninth: To restrain my sight, except in receiving or
   dismissing the person with whom I have spoken.

   Tenth Addition. The tenth Addition is penance.

   This is divided into interior and exterior. The interior is to grieve
   for one's sins, with a firm purpose of not committing them nor any
   others. The exterior, or fruit of the first, is chastisement for the
   sins committed, and is chiefly taken in three ways.

   First Way. The first is as to eating. That is to say, when we leave off
   the superfluous, it is not penance, but temperance. It is penance when
   we leave off from the suitable; and the more and more, the greater and
   better--provided that the person does not injure himself, and that no
   notable illness follows.

   Second Way. The second, as to the manner of sleeping. Here too it is
   not penance to leave off the superfluous or delicate or soft things,
   but it is penance when one leaves off from the suitable in the manner:
   and the more and more, the better--provided that the person does not
   injure himself and no notable illness follows. Besides, let not
   anything of the suitable sleep be left off, unless in order to come to
   the mean, if one has a bad habit of sleeping too much.

   Third Way. The third, to chastise the flesh, that is, giving it
   sensible pain, which is given by wearing haircloth or cords or iron
   chains next to the flesh, by scourging or wounding oneself, and by
   other kinds of austerity.

   Note. What appears most suitable and most secure with regard to penance
   is that the pain should be sensible in the flesh and not enter within
   the bones, so that it give pain and not illness. For this it appears to
   be more suitable to scourge oneself with thin cords, which give pain
   exteriorly, rather than in another way which would cause notable
   illness within.

   First Note. The first Note is that the exterior penances are done
   chiefly for three ends: First, as satisfaction for the sins committed;

   Second, to conquer oneself--that is, to make sensuality obey reason and
   all inferior parts be more subject to the superior;

   Third, to seek and find some grace or gift which the person wants and
   desires; as, for instance, if he desires to have interior contrition
   for his sins, or to weep much over them, or over the pains and
   sufferings which Christ our Lord suffered in His Passion, or to settle
   some doubt in which the person finds himself.

   Second Note. The second: It is to be noted that the first and second
   Addition have to be made for the Exercises of midnight and at daybreak,
   but not for those which will be made at other times; and the fourth
   Addition will never be made in church in the presence of others, but in
   private, as at home, etc.

   Third Note. The third: When the person who is exercising himself does
   not yet find what he desires--as tears, consolations, etc.,--it often
   helps for him to make a change in food, in sleep and in other ways of
   doing penance, so that he change himself, doing penance two or three
   days, and two or three others not. For it suits some to do more penance
   and others less, and we often omit doing penance from sensual love and
   from an erroneous judgment that the human system will not be able to
   bear it without notable illness; and sometimes, on the contrary, we do
   too much, thinking that the body can bear it; and as God our Lord knows
   our nature infinitely better, often in such changes He gives each one
   to perceive what is suitable for him.

   Fourth Note. The fourth: Let the Particular Examen be made to rid
   oneself of defects and negligences on the Exercises and Additions. And
   so in the Second, Third and Fourth Weeks.

     __________________________________________________________________

THE CALL OF THE TEMPORAL KING

  IT HELPS TO CONTEMPLATE THE LIFE OF THE KING ETERNAL

   Prayer. Let the Preparatory Prayer be the usual one.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is a composition, seeing the place: it
   will be here to see with the sight of the imagination, the synagogues,
   [5] villages and towns through which Christ our Lord preached.

   Second Prelude. The second, to ask for the grace which I want: it will
   be here to ask grace of our Lord that I may not be deaf to His call,
   but ready and diligent to fulfill His most Holy Will.

   First Point. The first Point is, to put before me a human king chosen
   by God our Lord, whom all Christian princes and men reverence and obey.

   Second Point. The second, to look how this king speaks to all his
   people, saying: "It is my Will to conquer all the land of unbelievers.
   Therefore, whoever would like to come with me is to be content to eat
   as I, and also to drink and dress, etc., as I: likewise he is to labor
   like me [6] in the day and watch in the night, etc., that so afterwards
   he may have part with me in the victory, as he has had it in the
   labors."

   Third Point. The third, to consider what the good subjects ought to
   answer to a King so liberal and so kind, and hence, if any one did not
   accept the appeal of such a king, how deserving he would be of being
   censured by all the world, and held for a mean-spirited knight.

  IN PART 2

   The second part of this Exercise consists in applying the above parable
   of the temporal King to Christ our Lord, conformably to the three
   Points mentioned.

   First Point. And as to the first Point, if we consider such a call of
   the temporal King to his subjects, how much more worthy of
   consideration is it to see Christ our Lord, King eternal, and before
   Him all the entire world, which and each one in particular He calls,
   and says: "It is My will to conquer all the world and all enemies and
   so to enter into the glory of My Father; therefore, whoever would like
   to come with Me is to labor with Me, that following Me in the pain, he
   may also follow Me in the glory."

   Second Point. The second, to consider that all those who have judgment
   and reason will offer their entire selves to the labor.

   Third Point. The third, those who will want to be more devoted and
   signalise themselves in all service of their King Eternal and universal
   Lord, not only will offer their persons to the labor, but even, acting
   against their own sensuality and against their carnal and worldly love,
   will make offerings of greater value and greater importance, saying:

   "Eternal Lord of all things, I make my oblation with Thy favor and
   help, in presence of Thy infinite Goodness and in presence of Thy
   glorious Mother and of all the Saints of the heavenly Court; that I
   want and desire, and it is my deliberate determination, if only it be
   Thy greater service and praise, to imitate Thee in bearing all injuries
   and all abuse and all poverty of spirit, and actual poverty, too, if
   Thy most Holy Majesty wants to choose and receive me to such life and
   state."

   First Note. This Exercise will be made twice in the day; namely, in the
   morning on rising and an hour before dinner or before supper.

   Second Note. For the Second Week and so on, it is very helpful to read
   at intervals in the books of the Imitation of Christ, or of the
   Gospels, and of lives of Saints.

     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FIRST DAY AND FIRST CONTEMPLATION

  IT IS ON

THE INCARNATION

  AND CONTAINS THE PREPARATORY PRAYER,

  THREE PRELUDES, THREE POINTS

  AND ONE COLLOQUY

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is to bring up the narrative of the
   thing which I have to contemplate.

   Here, it is how the Three Divine Persons looked at all the plain or
   circuit of all the world, full of men, and how, seeing that all were
   going down to Hell, it is determined in Their Eternity, [7] that the
   Second Person shall become man to save the human race, and so, the
   fullness of times being come, [8] They sent the Angel St. Gabriel to
   Our Lady (p. 133).

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place: here it
   will be to see the great capacity and circuit of the world, in which
   are so many and such different people: then likewise, in particular,
   the house and rooms of Our Lady in the city of Nazareth, in the
   Province of Galilee.

   Third Prelude. The third, to ask for what I want: it will be to ask for
   interior knowledge of the Lord, Who for me has become man, that I may
   more love and follow Him.

   Note. It is well to note here that this same Preparatory Prayer,
   without changing it, as was said in the beginning, and the same three
   Preludes, are to be made in this Week and in the others following,
   changing the form according to the subject matter.

   First Point. The first Point is, to see the various persons: and first
   those on the surface of the earth, in such variety, in dress as in
   actions: some white and others black; some in peace and others in war;
   some weeping and others laughing; some well, others ill; some being
   born and others dying, etc.

   2. To see and consider the Three Divine Persons, as on their royal
   throne or seat of Their Divine Majesty, how They look on all the
   surface and circuit of the earth, and all the people in such blindness,
   and how they are dying and going down to Hell.

   3. To see Our Lady, and the Angel who is saluting her, and to reflect
   in order to get profit from such a sight.

   Second Point. The second, to hear what the persons on the face of the
   earth are saying, that is, how they are talking with one another, how
   they swear and blaspheme, etc.; and likewise what the Divine Persons
   are saying, that is: "Let Us work the redemption of the Human race,"
   etc.; and then what the Angel and Our Lady are saying; and to reflect
   then so as to draw profit from their words.

   Third Point. The third, to look then at what the persons on the face of
   the earth are doing, as, for instance, killing, going to Hell etc.;
   likewise what the Divine Persons are doing, namely, working out the
   most holy Incarnation, etc.; and likewise what the Angel and Our Lady
   are doing, namely, the Angel doing his duty as ambassador, and Our Lady
   humbling herself and giving thanks to the Divine Majesty; and then to
   reflect in order to draw some profit from each of these things.

   Colloquy. At the end a Colloquy is to be made, thinking what I ought to
   say to the Three Divine Persons, or to the Eternal Word incarnate, or
   to our Mother and Lady, asking according to what I feel in me, in order
   more to follow and imitate Our Lord, so lately incarnate.

   I will say an Our Father.

     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SECOND CONTEMPLATION

  IS ON

THE NATIVITY

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is the narrative and it will be here
   how Our Lady went forth from Nazareth, about nine months with child, as
   can be piously meditated, [9] seated on an ass, and accompanied by
   Joseph and a maid, taking an ox, to go to Bethlehem to pay the tribute
   which Caesar imposed on all those lands (p. 135).

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be
   here to see with the sight of the imagination the road from Nazareth to
   Bethlehem; considering the length and the breadth, and whether such
   road is level or through valleys or over hills; likewise looking at the
   place or cave of the Nativity, [10] how large, how small, how low, how
   high, and how it was prepared.

   Third Prelude. The third will be the same, and in the same form, as in
   the preceding Contemplation.

   First Point. The first Point is to see the persons; that is, to see Our
   Lady and Joseph and the maid, and, after His Birth, the Child Jesus, I
   making myself a poor creature and a wretch of an unworthy slave,
   looking at them and serving them in their needs, with all possible
   respect and reverence, as if I found myself present; and then to
   reflect on myself in order to draw some profit.

   Second Point. The second, to look, mark and contemplate what they are
   saying, and, reflecting on myself, to draw some profit.

   Third Point. The third, to look and consider what they are doing, as
   going a journey and laboring, that the Lord may be born in the greatest
   poverty; and as a termination of so many labors--of hunger, of thirst,
   of heat and of cold, of injuries and affronts--that He may die on the
   Cross; and all this for me: then reflecting, to draw some spiritual
   profit.

   Colloquy. I will finish with a Colloquy as in the preceding
   Contemplation, and with an Our Father.

  THE THIRD CONTEMPLATION

  WILL BE A REPETITION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND EXERCISE

   After the Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, the repetition of
   the first and second Exercise will be made, noting always some more
   principal parts, where the person has felt some knowledge, consolation
   or desolation, making likewise one Colloquy at the end, and saying an
   Our Father.

   In this repetition, and in all the following, the same order of
   proceeding will be taken as was taken in the repetitions of the First
   Week, changing the matter and keeping the form.

  THE FOURTH CONTEMPLATION

  WILL BE A REPETITION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND

   In the same way as was done in the above-mentioned repetition.

  THE FIFTH CONTEMPLATION

  WILL BE TO BRING THE FIVE SENSES ON THE FIRST AND SECOND CONTEMPLATION

   Prayer. After the Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, it is
   helpful to pass the five senses of the imagination through the first
   and second Contemplation, in the following way:

   First Point. The first Point is to see the persons with the sight of
   the imagination, meditating and contemplating in particular the details
   about them and drawing some profit from the sight.

   Second Point. The second, to hear with the hearing what they are, or
   might be, talking about and, reflecting on oneself, to draw some profit
   from it.

   Third Point. The third, to smell and to taste with the smell and the
   taste the infinite fragrance and sweetness of the Divinity, of the
   soul, and of its virtues, and of all, according to the person who is
   being contemplated; reflecting on oneself and drawing profit from it.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to touch with the touch, as for instance, to
   embrace and kiss the places where such persons put their feet and sit,
   always seeing to my drawing profit from it.

   Colloquy. One has to finish with one Colloquy as in the first and
   second Contemplation, and with an Our Father.

   First Note. The first note is to remark for all this and the other
   following Weeks, that I have only to read the Mystery of the
   Contemplation which I have immediately to make, so that at any time I
   read no Mystery which I have not to make that day or at that hour, in
   order that the consideration of one Mystery may not hinder the
   consideration of the other.

   Second Note. The second: The first Exercise, on the Incarnation, will
   be made at midnight; the second at dawn; the third at the hour of Mass;
   the fourth at the hour of Vespers, and the fifth before the hour of
   supper, being for the space of one hour in each one of the five
   Exercises; and the same order will be taken in all the following.

   Third Note. The third: It is to be remarked that if the person who is
   making the Exercises is old or weak, or, although strong, has become in
   some way less strong from the First Week, it is better for him in this
   Second Week, at least sometimes, not rising at midnight, to make one
   Contemplation in the morning, and another at the hour of Mass, and
   another before dinner, and one repetition on them at the hour of
   Vespers, and then the Application of the Senses before supper.

   Fourth Note. The fourth: In this Second Week, out of all the ten
   Additions which were mentioned in the First Week, the second, the
   sixth, the seventh and in part the tenth have to be changed.

   In the second it will be, immediately on waking up, to put before me
   the contemplation which I have to make, desiring to know more the
   Eternal Word incarnate, in order to serve and to follow Him more.

   The sixth will be to bring frequently to memory the Life and Mysteries
   of Christ our Lord, from His Incarnation down to the place or Mystery
   which I am engaged in contemplating.

   The seventh will be, that one should manage as to keeping darkness or
   light, making use of good weather or bad, according as he feels that it
   can profit and help him to find what the person desires who is
   exercising himself.

   And in the tenth Addition, he who is exercising himself ought to manage
   himself according to the Mysteries which he is contemplating; because
   some demand penance and others not.

   All the ten Additions, then, are to be made with great care.

   Fifth Note. The fifth note: In all the Exercises, except in that of
   midnight and in that of the morning, the equivalent of the second
   Addition will be taken in the following way:--Immediately on
   recollecting that it is the time of the Exercise which I have to make,
   before I go, putting before myself where I am going and before Whom,
   and summarizing a little the Exercise which I have to make, and then
   making the third Addition, I will enter into the Exercise.

  THE SECOND DAY

   Second Day. For first and second Contemplation to take the Presentation
   in the Temple (p. 137) and the Flight to Egypt as into exile (p. 138),
   and on these two Contemplations will be made two repetitions and the
   Application of the Five Senses to them, in the same way as was done the
   preceding day.

   Note. Sometimes, although the one who is exercising himself is strong
   and disposed, it helps to make a change, from this second day up to the
   fourth inclusively, in order better to find what he desires, taking
   only one Contemplation at daybreak, and another at the hour of Mass,
   and to repeat on them at the hour of Vespers and apply the senses
   before supper.

  THE THIRD DAY

   Third Day. How the Child Jesus was obedient to His Parents at Nazareth
   (p. 139), and how afterwards they found Him in the Temple (p. 140), and
   so then to make the two repetitions and apply the five senses.

     __________________________________________________________________

PREAMBLE TO CONSIDER STATES

   First Preamble. The example which Christ our Lord, being under
   obedience to His parents, has given us for the first state, -- which
   consists in the observance of the Commandments--having been now
   considered; and likewise for the second,--which is that of evangelical
   perfection,--when He remained in the Temple, leaving His adoptive
   father and His natural Mother, to attend to the pure service of His
   eternal Father; we will begin, at the same time contemplating His life,
   to investigate and to ask in what life or state His Divine Majesty
   wants to be served by us.

   And so, for some introduction of it, we will, in the first Exercise
   following, see the intention of Christ our Lord, and, on the contrary,
   that of the enemy of human nature, and how we ought to dispose
   ourselves in order to come to perfection in whatever state of life God
   our Lord would give us to choose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE FOURTH DAY

  MEDITATION ON

TWO STANDARDS

   The one of Christ, our Commander-in-chief and Lord; the other of
   Lucifer, mortal enemy of our human nature.

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The First Prelude is the narrative. It will be here how
   Christ calls and wants all under His standard; and Lucifer, on the
   contrary, under his.

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be
   here to see a great field of all that region of Jerusalem, where the
   supreme Commander-in-chief of the good is Christ our Lord; another
   field in the region of Babylon, where the chief of the enemy is
   Lucifer.

   Third Prelude. The third, to ask for what I want: and it will be here
   to ask for knowledge of the deceits of the bad chief and help to guard
   myself against them, and for knowledge of the true life which the
   supreme and true Captain shows and grace to imitate Him.

   First Point. The first Point is to imagine as if the chief of all the
   enemy seated himself in that great field of Babylon, as in a great [11]
   chair of fire and smoke, in shape horrible and terrifying.

   Second Point. The second, to consider how he issues a summons to
   innumerable demons and how he scatters them, some to one city and
   others to another, and so through all the world, not omitting any
   provinces, places, states, nor any persons in particular.

   Third Point. The third, to consider the discourse which he makes them,
   and how he tells them to cast out nets and chains; that they have first
   to tempt with a longing for riches--as he is accustomed to do in most
   cases [12] --that men may more easily come to vain honor of the world,
   and then to vast pride. So that the first step shall be that of riches;
   the second, that of honor; the third, that of pride; and from these
   three steps he draws on to all the other vices.

   So, on the contrary, one has to imagine as to the supreme and true
   Captain, Who is Christ our Lord.

   First Point. The first Point is to consider how Christ our Lord puts
   Himself in a great field of that region of Jerusalem, in lowly place,
   beautiful and attractive.

   Second Point. The second, to consider how the Lord of all the world
   chooses so many persons--Apostles, Disciples, etc.,--and sends them
   through all the world spreading His sacred doctrine through all states
   and conditions of persons.

   Third Point. The third, to consider the discourse which Christ our Lord
   makes to all His servants and friends whom He sends on this expedition,
   recommending them to want to help all, by bringing them first to the
   highest spiritual poverty, and--if His Divine Majesty would be served
   and would want to choose them--no less to actual poverty; the second is
   to be of contumely and contempt; because from these two things humility
   follows. So that there are to be three steps; the first, poverty
   against riches; the second, contumely or contempt against worldly
   honor; the third, humility against pride. And from these three steps
   let them induce to all the other virtues.

   First Colloquy. One Colloquy to Our Lady, that she may get me grace
   from Her Son and Lord that I may be received under His standard; and
   first in the highest spiritual poverty, and--if His Divine Majesty
   would be served and would want to choose and receive me--not less in
   actual poverty; second, in suffering contumely and injuries, to imitate
   Him more in them, if only I can suffer them without the sin of any
   person, or displeasure of His Divine Majesty; and with that a Hail
   Mary.

   Second Colloquy. I will ask the same of the Son, that He may get it for
   me of the Father; and with that say the Soul of Christ.

   Third Colloquy. I will ask the same of the Father, that He may grant it
   to me; and say an Our Father.

   Note. This Exercise will be made at midnight and then a second time in
   the morning, and two repetitions of this same will be made at the hour
   of Mass and at the hour of Vespers, always finishing with the three
   Colloquies, to Our Lady, to the Son, and to the Father; and that on The
   Pairs which follows, at the hour before supper.

     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SAME FOURTH DAY LET MEDITATION BE MADE ON

THREE PAIRS OF MEN

  IN ORDER TO EMBRACE WHAT IS BEST

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is the narrative, which is of three
   pairs of men, and each one of them has acquired ten thousand ducats,
   not solely or as they ought [13] for God's love, and all want to save
   themselves and find in peace God our Lord, ridding themselves of the
   weight and hindrance to it which they have in the attachment for the
   thing acquired.

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be
   here to see myself, how I stand before God our Lord and all His Saints,
   to desire and know what is more pleasing to His Divine Goodness.

   Third Prelude. The third, to ask for what I want. Here it will be to
   ask grace to choose what is more to the glory of His Divine Majesty and
   the salvation of my soul.

   First Pair. The first Pair would want to rid themselves of the
   attachment which they have to the thing acquired, in order to find in
   peace God our Lord, and be able to save themselves, and they do not
   place the means up to the hour of death.

   Second Pair. The second want to rid themselves of the attachment, but
   want so to rid themselves of it as to remain with the thing acquired,
   so that God should come where they want, and they do not decide to
   leave it in order to go to God, although it would be the best state for
   them

   Third Pair. The third want to rid themselves of the attachment, but
   want so to rid themselves of it that they have even no liking for it,
   to keep the thing acquired or not to keep it, but only want to want it
   or not want it according as God our Lord will put in their will and as
   will appear to them better for the service and praise of His Divine
   Majesty; and meanwhile they want to reckon that they quit it all in
   attachment, forcing themselves not to want that or any other thing,
   unless only the service of God our Lord move them: so that the desire
   of being better able to serve God our Lord moves them to take the thing
   or leave it.

   Three Colloquies. I will make the same three Colloquies which were made
   in the Contemplation preceding, on the Two Standards.

   Note. It is to be noted that when we feel a tendency or repugnance
   against actual poverty, when we are not indifferent to poverty or
   riches, it is very helpful, in order to crush such disordered tendency,
   to ask in the Colloquies (although it be against the flesh) that the
   Lord should choose one to actual poverty, and that one wants, asks and
   begs it, if only it be the service and praise of His Divine Goodness.

  THE FIFTH DAY

   Fifth Day. Contemplation on the Departure of Christ our Lord from
   Nazareth to the River Jordan, and how He was baptized (p. 140).

   First Note. This Contemplation will be made once at midnight and a
   second time in the morning, and two repetitions on it at the hour of
   Mass and Vespers, and the five senses will be applied on it before
   supper; in each of these five Exercises, putting first the usual
   Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, as all this was explained in
   the Contemplation of the Incarnation and of the Nativity; and finishing
   with the three Colloquies of the three Pairs, or according to the note
   which follows after the Pairs.

   Second Note. The Particular Examen, after dinner and after supper, will
   be made on the faults and negligences about the Exercises and Additions
   of this day; and so in the days that follow.

  THE SIXTH DAY

   Sixth Day. Contemplation how Christ our Lord went forth from the River
   Jordan to the Desert inclusive, taking the same form in everything as
   on the fifth.

  THE SEVENTH DAY

   Seventh Day. How St. Andrew and others followed Christ our Lord (p.
   142).

  THE EIGHTH DAY

   Eighth Day. On the Sermon on the Mount, which is on the Eight
   Beatitudes (P. 144).

  THE NINTH DAY

   Ninth Day. How Christ our Lord appeared to His disciples on the waves
   of the sea (p. 145).

  THE TENTH DAY

   Tenth Day. How the Lord preached in the [14] Temple (p. 151).

  THE ELEVENTH DAY

   Eleventh Day. On the raising of Lazarus (p. 149).

  THE TWELFTH DAY

   Twelfth Day. On Palm Sunday (p. 151).

   First Note. The first note is that in the Contemplations of this Second
   Week, according to the time each one wants to spend, or according as he
   gets profit, he can lengthen or shorten: if he lengthens, taking the
   Mysteries of the Visitation of Our Lady to St. Elizabeth, the
   Shepherds, the Circumcision of the Child Jesus, and the Three Kings,
   and so of others; and if he shortens, he can even omit some of those
   which are set down. Because this is to give an introduction and way to
   contemplate better and more completely afterwards.

   Second Note. The second: The matter of the Elections will be begun from
   the Contemplation on Nazareth to the Jordan, taken inclusively, which
   is the fifth day, as is explained in the following.

   Third Note. The third: Before entering on the Elections, that a man may
   get attachment to the true doctrine of Christ our Lord, it is very
   helpful to consider and mark the following three Manners of Humility,
   reflecting on them occasionally through all the day, and also making
   the Colloquies, as will be said later.

   First Humility. The first manner of Humility is necessary for eternal
   salvation; namely, that I so lower and so humble myself, as much as is
   possible to me, that in everything I obey the law of God, so that, even
   if they made me lord of all the created things in this world, nor for
   my own temporal life, I would not be in deliberation about breaking a
   Commandment, whether Divine or human, which binds me under mortal sin.

   Second Humility. The second is more perfect Humility than the first;
   namely, if I find myself at such a stage that I do not want, and feel
   no inclination to have, riches rather than poverty, to want honor
   rather than dishonor, to desire a long rather than a short life--the
   service of God our Lord and the salvation of my soul being equal; and
   so not for all creation, nor because they would take away my life,
   would I be in deliberation about committing a venial sin.

   Third Humility. The third is most perfect Humility; namely,
   when--including the first and second, and the praise and glory of the
   Divine Majesty being equal--in order to imitate and be more actually
   like Christ our Lord, I want and choose poverty with Christ poor rather
   than riches, opprobrium with Christ replete with it rather than honors;
   and to desire to be rated as worthless and a fool for Christ, Who first
   was held as such, rather than wise or prudent in this world.

   Note. So, it is very helpful for whoever desires to get this third
   Humility, to make the three already mentioned Colloquies of The Pairs,
   asking that Our Lord would be pleased to choose him to this third
   greater and better Humility, in order more to imitate and serve Him, if
   it be equal or greater service and praise to His Divine Majesty.

PRELUDE FOR MAKING ELECTION

   First Point. In every good election, as far as depends on us, the eye
   of our intention ought to be simple, only looking at what we are
   created for, namely, the praise of God our Lord and the salvation of
   our soul. And so I ought to choose whatever I do, that it may help me
   for the end for which I am created, not ordering or bringing the end to
   the means, but the means to the end: as it happens that many choose
   first to marry--which is a means--and secondarily to serve God our Lord
   in the married life--which service of God is the end. So, too, there
   are others who first want to have benefices, and then to serve God in
   them. So that those do not go straight to God, but want God to come
   straight to their disordered tendencies, and consequently they make a
   means of the end, and an end of the means. So that what they had to
   take first, they take last; because first we have to set as our aim the
   wanting to serve God,--which is the end,--and secondarily, to take a
   benefice, or to marry, if it is more suitable to us,--which is the
   means for the end. So, nothing ought to move me to take such means or
   to deprive myself of them, except only the service and praise of God
   our Lord and the eternal salvation of my soul.

   TO GET KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT MATTERS AN ELECTION OUGHT TO BE MADE ABOUT,
   AND IT CONTAINS FOUR POINTS AND ONE NOTE

   First Point. The first Point: It is necessary that everything about
   which we want to make an election should be indifferent, or good, in
   itself, and should be allowed within our Holy Mother the hierarchical
   Church, and not bad nor opposed to her.

   Second Point. Second: There are some things which fall under
   unchangeable election, such as are the priesthood, marriage, etc. There
   are others which fall under an election that can be changed, such as
   are to take benefices or leave them, to take temporal goods or rid
   oneself of them.

   Third Point. Third: In the unchangeable Election which has already been
   once made--such as marriage, the priesthood, etc.--there is nothing
   more to choose, because one cannot release himself; only it is to be
   seen to that if one have not made his election duly and ordinately and
   without disordered tendencies, repenting let him see to living a good
   life in his election. It does not appear that this election is a Divine
   vocation, [15] as being an election out of order and awry. Many err in
   this, setting up a perverse or bad election as a Divine [16] vocation;
   for every Divine vocation is always pure and clear, without mixture of
   flesh, or of any other inordinate tendency.

   Fourth Point. Fourth: If some one has duly and ordinately made election
   of things which are under election that can be changed, and has not
   yielded to flesh or world, there is no reason for his making election
   anew, but let him perfect himself as much as he can in that already
   chosen.

   Note. It is to be remarked that if such election that can be changed
   was not made sincerely and well in order, then it helps to make the
   election duly, if one has a desire that fruits notable and very
   pleasing to God our Lord should come from him.

  THREE TIMES

  FOR MAKING, IN ANY ONE OF THEM, A SOUND

  AND GOOD ELECTION

   First Time. The first time is, when God our Lord so moves and attracts
   the will, that without doubting, or being able to doubt, such devout
   soul follows what is shown it, as St. Paul and St. Matthew did in
   following Christ our Lord.

   Second Time. The second, when enough light and knowledge is received by
   experience of consolations and desolations, and by the experience of
   the discernment of various spirits.

   Third Time. The third time is quiet, when one considers, first, for
   what man is born--namely, to praise God our Lord and save his soul--and
   desiring this chooses as means a life or state within the limits of the
   Church, in order that he may be helped in the service of his Lord and
   the salvation of his soul.

   I said time of quiet, when the soul is not acted on by various spirits,
   and uses its natural powers freely and tranquilly.

   If election is not made in the first or the second time, two ways
   follow as to this third time for making it.

  THE FIRST WAY

  TO MAKE A SOUND AND GOOD ELECTION

   It contains six Points.

   First Point. The first Point is to put before me the thing on which I
   want to make election, such as an office or benefice, either to take or
   leave it; or any other thing whatever which falls under an election
   that can be changed.

   Second Point. Second: It is necessary to keep as aim the end for which
   I am created, which is to praise God our Lord and save my soul, and,
   this supposed, to find myself indifferent, without any inordinate
   propensity; so that I be not more inclined or disposed to take the
   thing proposed than to leave it, nor more to leave it than to take it,
   but find myself as in the middle of a balance, to follow what I feel to
   be more for the glory and praise of God our Lord and the salvation of
   my soul.

   Third Point. Third: To ask of God our Lord to be pleased to move my
   will and put in my soul what I ought to do regarding the thing
   proposed, so as to promote more His praise and glory; discussing well
   and faithfully with my intellect, and choosing agreeably to His most
   holy pleasure and will.

   Fourth Point. Fourth: To consider, reckoning up, how many advantages
   and utilities follow for me from holding the proposed office or
   benefice for only the praise of God our Lord and the salvation of my
   soul, and, to consider likewise, on the contrary, the disadvantages and
   dangers which there are in having it. Doing the same in the second
   part, that is, looking at the advantages and utilities there are in not
   having it, and likewise, on the contrary, the disadvantages and dangers
   in not having the same.

   Fifth Point. Fifth: After I have thus discussed and reckoned up on all
   sides about the thing proposed, to look where reason more inclines: and
   so, according to the greater inclination of reason, and not according
   to any inclination of sense, deliberation should be made on the thing
   proposed.

   Sixth Point. Sixth, such election, or deliberation, made, the person
   who has made it ought to go with much diligence to prayer before God
   our Lord and offer Him such election, that His Divine Majesty may be
   pleased to receive and confirm it, if it is to His greater service and
   praise.

  THE SECOND WAY

  TO MAKE A GOOD ANY SOUND ELECTION

   It contains four Rules and one Note.

   First Rule. The first is that that love which moves me and makes me
   choose such thing should descend from above, from the love of God, so
   that he who chooses feel first in himself that that love, more or less,
   which he has for the thing which he chooses, is only for his Creator
   and Lord.

   Second Rule. The second, to set before me a man whom I have never seen
   nor known, and I [17] desiring all his perfection, to consider what I
   would tell him to do and elect for the greater glory of God our Lord,
   and the greater perfection of his soul, and I, doing likewise, to keep
   the rule which I set for the other.

   Third Rule. The third, to consider, as if I were at the point of death,
   the form and measure which I would then want to have kept in the way of
   the present election, and regulating myself by that election, let me
   make my decision in everything.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth, looking and considering how I shall find
   myself on the Day of Judgment, to think how I would then want to have
   [18] deliberated about the present matter, and to take now the rule
   which I would then wish to have kept, in order that I may then find
   myself in entire pleasure and joy.

   Note. The above-mentioned rules for my eternal salvation and peace
   having been taken, I will make my election and offering to God our
   Lord, conformably to the sixth Point of the First Way of making
   election.

  TO AMEND AND REFORM ONE'S OWN LIFE

  AND STATE

   It is to be noted that as to those who are settled in ecclesiastical
   office or in matrimony--whether they abound much or not in temporal
   goods--when they have no opportunity or have not a very prompt will to
   make election about the things which fall under an election that can be
   changed, it is very helpful, in place of making election, to give them
   a form and way to amend and reform each his own life and state. That
   is, putting his creation, life and state for the glory and praise of
   God our Lord and the salvation of his own soul, to come and arrive at
   this end, he ought to consider much and ponder through the Exercises
   and Ways of Election, as has been explained, how large a house and
   household he ought to keep, how he ought to rule and govern it, how he
   ought to teach and instruct it by word and by example; likewise of his
   means, how much he ought to take for his household and house; and how
   much to dispense to the poor and to other pious objects, not wanting
   nor seeking any other thing except in all and through all the greater
   praise and glory of God our Lord.

   For let each one think that he will benefit himself in all spiritual
   things in proportion as he goes out of his self-love, will and
   interest.

                                   THIRD WEEK
     __________________________________________________________________

  FIRST DAY

  THE FIRST CONTEMPLATION AT MIDNIGHT IS

HOW CHRIST OUR LORD WENT FROM BETHANY TO

JERUSALEM TO THE LAST SUPPER INCLUSIVELY

   (p. 152); and it contains the Preparatory Prayer, three Preludes, six
   Points and one Colloquy.

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is to bring to memory the narrative;
   which is here how Christ our Lord sent two Disciples from Bethany to
   Jerusalem to prepare the Supper, and then He Himself went there with
   the other Disciples; and how, after having eaten the Paschal Lamb, and
   having supped, He washed their feet and gave His most Holy Body and
   Precious Blood to His Disciples, and made them a discourse, after Judas
   went to sell his Lord.

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be
   here to consider the road from Bethany to Jerusalem, whether broad,
   whether narrow, whether level, etc.; likewise the place of the Supper,
   whether large, whether small, whether of one kind or whether of
   another.

   Third Prelude. The third, to ask for what I want. It will be here
   grief, feeling and confusion because for my sins the Lord is going to
   the Passion.

   First Point. The first Point is to see the persons of the Supper, and,
   reflecting on myself, to see to drawing some profit from them.

   Second Point. The second, to hear what they are talking about, and
   likewise to draw some profit from it.

   Third Point. The third, to look at what they are doing, and draw some
   profit.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to consider that which Christ our Lord is
   suffering in His Humanity, [19] or wants to suffer, according to the
   passage which is being contemplated, and here to commence with much
   vehemence and to force myself to grieve, be sad and weep, and so to
   labor through the other points which follow.

   Fifth Point. The fifth, to consider how the Divinity hides Itself, that
   is, how It could destroy Its enemies and does not do it, and how It
   leaves the most sacred Humanity to suffer so very cruelly.

   Sixth Point. The sixth, to consider how He suffers all this for my
   sins, etc.; and what I ought to do and suffer for Him.

   Colloquy. I will finish with a Colloquy to Christ our Lord, and, at the
   end, with an Our Father.

   Note. It is to be noted, as was explained before and in part, that in
   the Colloquies I ought to discuss and ask according to the subject
   matter, that is, according as I find myself tempted or consoled, and
   according as I desire to have one virtue or another, as I want to
   dispose of myself in one direction or another, as I want to grieve or
   rejoice at the thing which I am contemplating; in fine, asking that
   which I more efficaciously desire as to any particular things. And in
   this way I can make one Colloquy only, to Christ our Lord, or, if the
   matter or devotion move me, three Colloquies, one to the Mother,
   another to the Son, another to the Father, in the same form as was said
   in the Second Week, in the meditation of the Three Pairs, with the Note
   which follows The Pairs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] In His Humanity is in St. Ignatius' hand, correcting the Humanity
   of before Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECOND DAY

  SECOND CONTEMPLATION

  IN THE MORNING

  IT WILL BE

FROM THE SUPPER TO THE

GARDEN INCLUSIVELY

   Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is the narrative and it will be here
   how Christ our Lord went down with His eleven Disciples from Mount
   Sion, where He made the Supper, to the Valley of Josaphat. Leaving the
   eight in a part of the Valley and the other three in a part of the
   Garden, and putting Himself in prayer, He sweats sweat as drops of
   blood, [20] and after He prayed three times to the Father and wakened
   His three Disciples, and after the enemies at His voice fell down,
   Judas giving Him the kiss of peace, and St. Peter cutting off the ear
   of Malchus, and Christ putting it in its place; being taken as a
   malefactor, they lead Him down the valley, and then up the side, to the
   house of Annas.

   Second Prelude. The second is to see the place. It will be here to
   consider the road from Mount Sion to the Valley of Josaphat, and
   likewise the Garden, whether wide, whether large, whether of one kind,
   whether of another.

   Third Prelude. The third is to ask for what I want. It belongs to the
   Passion to ask for grief with Christ in grief, anguish with Christ in
   anguish, tears and interior pain at such great pain which Christ
   suffered for me.

   First Note. In this second Contemplation, after the Preparatory Prayer
   is made, with the three Preludes already mentioned, the same form of
   proceeding will be kept through the Points and Colloquy as was kept in
   the first Contemplation, on the Supper.

   And at the hour of Mass and Vespers two repetitions will be made on the
   first and second Contemplation, and then, before supper, the senses
   will be applied on the two above-said Contemplations, always prefixing
   the Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, according to the subject
   matter, in the same form as was said and explained in the Second Week.

   Second Note. According as age, disposition and physical condition help
   the person who is exercising himself, he will make each day the five
   Exercises or fewer.

   Third Note. In this Third Week the second and sixth Additions will in
   part be changed.

   The second will be, immediately on awaking, to set before me where I am
   going and to what, and summing up a little the contemplation which I
   want to make, according as the Mystery shall be, to force myself, while
   I am getting up and dressing, to be sad and grieve over such great
   grief and such great suffering of Christ our Lord.

   The sixth will be changed, so as not to try to bring joyful thoughts,
   although good and holy, as, for instance, are those on the Resurrection
   and on heavenly glory, but rather to draw myself to grief and to pain
   and anguish, bringing to mind frequently the labors, fatigues and pains
   of Christ our Lord, which He suffered from the moment when He was born
   up to the Mystery of the Passion in which I find myself at present.

   Fourth Note. The Particular Examen on the Exercises and present
   Additions, will be made as it was made in the past Week.

   Second Day. The second day at midnight, the Contemplation will be from
   the Garden to the house of Annas inclusive (P. 154), and in the morning
   from the house of Annas to the house of Caiphas inclusive (P. 155), and
   then the two repetitions and the application of the senses, as has been
   already said.

   Third Day. The third day, at midnight, from the house of Caiphas to
   Pilate, inclusive (p. 155); and in the morning, from Pilate to Herod
   inclusive (p. 156); and then the repetitions and senses, in the same
   form as has been already said.

   Fourth Day. The fourth day, at midnight, from Herod to Pilate (p. 157),
   doing and contemplating up to half through the Mysteries of the same
   house of Pilate, and then, in the Exercise of the morning, the other
   Mysteries which remained of the same house; and the repetitions and the
   senses, as has been said.

   Fifth Day. The fifth day, at midnight, from the house of Pilate up to
   the Crucifixion (p. 158), and in the morning from His being raised on
   the Cross until He expired (p. 158), then the two repetitions, and the
   senses.

   Sixth Day. The sixth day, at midnight, from the Descent from the Cross
   to the Tomb, exclusive (p. 159) and in the morning from the Tomb,
   inclusive, to the house where Our Lady was, after her Son was buried.

   Seventh Day. The seventh day, a Contemplation on the whole Passion
   together, in the Exercise of midnight and of the morning, and in place
   of the two repetitions and of the senses one will consider all that
   day, as frequently as he can, how the most holy Body of Christ our Lord
   remained separated and apart from the Soul: and where and how It
   remained buried. Likewise, one will consider the loneliness of Our
   Lady, whose grief and fatigue were so great: then, on the other side,
   the loneliness of the Disciples.

   Note. It is to be noted that whoever wants to dwell more on the
   Passion, has to take in each Contemplation fewer Mysteries; that is to
   say, in the first Contemplation, the Supper only; in the second, the
   Washing of the Feet; in the third, the giving of the Blessed Sacrament
   to them; in the fourth, the discourse which Christ made to them; and so
   through the other Contemplations and Mysteries.

   Likewise, after having finished the Passion, let him take for an entire
   day the half of the whole Passion, and the second day the other half,
   and the third day the whole Passion.

   On the contrary, whoever would want to shorten more in the Passion, let
   him take at midnight the Supper, in the morning the Garden, at the hour
   of Mass the house of Annas, at the hour of Vespers the house of
   Caiphas, in place of the hour before supper the house of Pilate; so
   that, not making repetitions, nor the Application of the Senses, he
   make each day five distinct Exercises, and in each Exercise take a
   distinct Mystery of Christ our Lord. And after thus finishing the whole
   Passion, he can, another day, do all the Passion together in one
   Exercise, or in different ones, as it will seem to him that he will be
   better able to help himself.

     __________________________________________________________________

  RULES TO PUT ONESELF IN ORDER FOR THE FUTURE

AS TO EATING

   First Rule. The first rule is that it is well to abstain less from
   bread, because it is not a food as to which the appetite is used to act
   so inordinately, or to which temptation urges as in the case of the
   other foods.

   Second Rule. The second: Abstinence appears more convenient as to
   drinking, than as to eating bread. So, one ought to look much what is
   helpful to him, in order to admit it, and what does him harm, in order
   to discard it.

   Third Rule. The third: As to foods, one ought to have the greatest and
   most entire abstinence, because as the appetite is more ready to act
   inordinately, so temptation is more ready in making trial, on this
   head. And so abstinence in foods, to avoid disorder, can be kept in two
   ways, one by accustoming oneself to eat coarse foods; the other, if one
   takes delicate foods, by taking them in small quantity.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth: Guarding against falling into sickness, the
   more a man leaves off from what is suitable, the more quickly he will
   reach the mean which he ought to keep in his eating and drinking; for
   two reasons: the first, because by so helping and disposing himself, he
   will many times experience more the interior knowledge, consolations
   and Divine inspirations to show him the mean which is proper for him;
   the second, because if the person sees himself in such abstinence not
   with so great corporal strength or disposition for the Spiritual
   Exercises, he will easily come to judge what is more suitable to his
   bodily support.

   Fifth Rule. The fifth: While the person is eating, let him consider as
   if he saw Christ our Lord eating with His Apostles, and how He drinks
   and how He looks and how He speaks; and let him see to imitating Him.
   So that the principal part of the intellect shall occupy itself in the
   consideration of Christ our Lord, and the lesser part in the support of
   the body; because in this way he will get greater system and order as
   to how he ought to behave and manage himself.

   Sixth Rule. The sixth: Another time, while he is eating, he can take
   another consideration, either on the life of Saints, or on some pious
   Contemplation, or on some spiritual affair which he has to do, because,
   being intent on such thing, he will take less delight and feeling in
   the corporal food.

   Seventh Rule. The seventh: Above all, let him guard against all his
   soul being intent on what he is eating, and in eating let him not go
   hurriedly, through appetite, but be master of himself, as well in the
   manner of eating as in the quantity which he eats.

   Eighth Rule. The eighth: To avoid disorder, it is very helpful, after
   dinner or after supper, or at another hour when one feels no appetite
   for eating, to decide with oneself for the coming dinner or supper, and
   so on, each day, the quantity which it is suitable that he should eat.
   Beyond this let him not go because of any appetite or temptation, but
   rather, in order to conquer more all inordinate appetite and temptation
   of the enemy, if he is tempted to eat more, let him eat less.

                                  FOURTH WEEK

  THE FIRST CONTEMPLATION

HOW CHRIST OUR LORD APPEARED

TO OUR LADY

   (p. 160); Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is the narrative, which is here how,
   after Christ expired on the Cross, and the Body, always united with the
   Divinity, remained separated from the Soul, the blessed Soul, likewise
   united with the Divinity, went down to Hell, and taking from there the
   just souls, and coming to the Sepulchre and being risen, He appeared to
   His Blessed Mother in Body and in Soul.

   Second Prelude. The second, a composition, seeing the place; which will
   be here to see the arrangement of the Holy Sepulchre and the place or
   house of Our Lady, looking at its parts in particular; likewise the
   room, the oratory, etc.

   Third Prelude. The third, to ask for what I want, and it will be here
   to ask for grace to rejoice and be glad intensely at so great glory and
   joy of Christ our Lord.

   First Point, Second Point, and Third Point. Let the first, second and
   third Points be the same usual ones which we took in the Supper of
   Christ our Lord.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to consider how the Divinity, which seemed to
   hide Itself in the Passion, now appears and shows Itself so
   marvellously in the most holy Resurrection by Its true and most holy
   effects.

   Fifth Point. The fifth is to consider the office of consoling which
   Christ our Lord bears, and to compare how friends are accustomed to
   console friends.

   Colloquy. I will finish with a Colloquy, or Colloquies, according to
   the subject matter, and an Our Father.

   First Note. In the following Contemplations let one go on through all
   the Mysteries of the Resurrection, in the manner which follows below,
   up to the Ascension inclusive, taking and keeping in the rest the same
   form and manner in all the Week of the Resurrection which was taken in
   all the Week of the Passion. So that, for this first Contemplation, on
   the Resurrection, let one guide himself as to the Preludes according to
   the subject matter; and as to the five Points, let them be the same;
   and let the Additions which are below be the same; and so in all which
   remains, he can guide himself by the method of the Week of the Passion,
   as in repetitions, the five Senses, in shortening or lengthening the
   Mysteries.

   Second Note. The second note: Commonly in this Fourth Week, it is more
   suitable than in the other three past to make four Exercises, and not
   five: the first, immediately on rising in the morning; the second, at
   the hour of Mass, or before dinner, in place of the first repetition;
   the third, at the hour of Vespers, in place of the second repetition;
   the fourth, before supper, bringing the five Senses on the three
   Exercises of the same day, noting and lingering on the more principal
   parts, and where one has felt greater spiritual movements and relish.

   Third Note. The third: Though in all the Contemplations so many Points
   were given in certain number--as three, or five, etc., the person who
   is contemplating can set more or fewer Points, according as he finds it
   better for him. For which it is very helpful, before entering on the
   Contemplation, to conjecture and mark in certain number the Points
   which he is to take.

   Fourth Note. In this fourth week, in all the ten Additions the second,
   the sixth, the seventh and the tenth are to be changed.

   The second will be, immediately on awaking, to put before me the
   Contemplation which I have to make, wanting to arouse feeling and be
   glad at the great joy and gladness of Christ our Lord.

   The sixth, to bring to memory and think of things that move to
   spiritual pleasure, gladness and joy, as of heavenly glory.

   The seventh, to use light or temporal comforts--as, in summer, the
   coolness; and in winter, the sun or heat--as far as the soul thinks or
   conjectures that it can help it to be joyful in its Creator and
   Redeemer.

   The tenth: in place of penance, let one regard temperance and all
   moderation; except it is question of precepts of fasting or of
   abstinence which the Church commands; because those are always to be
   fulfilled, if there is no just impediment.
     __________________________________________________________________

                           CONTEMPLATION TO GAIN LOVE

   Note. First, it is well to remark two things: the first is that love
   ought to be put more in deeds than in words.

   The second, love consists in interchange between the two parties; that
   is to say in the lover's giving and communicating to the beloved what
   he has or out of what he has or can; and so, on the contrary, the
   beloved to the lover. So that if the one has knowledge, he give to the
   one who has it not. The same of honors, of riches; and so the one to
   the other.

CONTEMPLATION TO GAIN LOVE

   Prayer. The usual Prayer.

   First Prelude. The first Prelude is a composition, which is here to see
   how I am standing before God our Lord, and of the Angels and of the
   Saints interceding for me.

   Second Prelude. The second, to ask for what I want. It will be here to
   ask for interior knowledge of so great good received, in order that
   being entirely grateful, I may be able in all to love and serve His
   Divine Majesty.

   First Point. The First Point is, to bring to memory the benefits
   received, of Creation, Redemption and particular gifts, pondering with
   much feeling how much God our Lord has done for me, and how much He has
   given me of what He has, and then the same Lord desires to give me
   Himself as much as He can, according to His Divine ordination.

   And with this to reflect on myself, considering with much reason and
   justice, what I ought on my side to offer and give to His Divine
   Majesty, that is to say, everything that is mine, and myself with it,
   as one who makes an offering with much feeling:

   Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my intellect, and
   all my will--all that I have and possess. Thou gavest it to me: to
   Thee, Lord, I return it! All is Thine, dispose of it according to all
   Thy will. Give me Thy love and grace, for this is enough for me.

   Second Point. The second, to look how God dwells in creatures, in the
   elements, giving them being, in the plants vegetating, in the animals
   feeling in them, in men giving them to understand: [21] and so in me,
   giving me being, animating me, giving me sensation and making me to
   understand; [22] likewise making a temple of me, being created to the
   likeness and image of His Divine Majesty; reflecting as much on myself
   in the way which is said in the first Point, or in another which I feel
   to be better. In the same manner will be done on each Point which
   follows.

   Third Point. The third, to consider how God works and labors for me in
   all things created on the face of the earth--that is, behaves like one
   who labors--as in the heavens, elements, plants, fruits, cattle, etc.,
   giving them being, preserving them, giving them vegetation and
   sensation, etc.

   Then to reflect on myself.

   Fourth Point. The fourth, to look how all the good things and gifts
   descend from above, as my poor power from the supreme and infinite
   power from above; and so justice, goodness, pity, mercy, etc.; as from
   the sun descend the rays, from the fountain the waters, etc.

   Then to finish reflecting on myself, as has been said.

   I will end with a Colloquy and an Our Father.

                            THREE METHODS OF PRAYER

  AND FIRST ON THE COMMANDMENTS
     __________________________________________________________________

  FIRST METHOD

   The first Method of Prayer is on the Ten Commandments, and on the Seven
   Deadly Sins, on the Three Powers of the Soul and on the Five Bodily
   Senses. This method of prayer is meant more to give form, method and
   exercises, how the soul may prepare itself and benefit in them, and
   that the prayer may be acceptable, rather than to give any form or way
   of praying.
     __________________________________________________________________

    I. The Ten Commandments

   First let the equivalent of the second Addition of the Second Week be
   made; that is, before entering on the prayer, let the spirit rest a
   little, the person being seated or walking about, as may seem best to
   him, considering where he is going and to what. And this same addition
   will be made at the beginning of all Methods of Prayer.

   Prayer. A Preparatory Prayer, as, for example, to ask grace of God our
   Lord that I may be able to know in what I have failed as to the Ten
   Commandments; and likewise to beg grace and help to amend in future,
   asking for perfect understanding of them, to keep them better and for
   the greater glory and praise of His Divine Majesty.

   For the first Method of Prayer, it is well to consider and think on the
   First Commandment, how I have kept it and in what I have failed,
   keeping to the rule of spending the space of time one says the Our
   Father and the Hail Mary three times; and if in this time I find faults
   of mine, to ask pardon and forgiveness for them, and say an Our Father.
   Let this same method be followed on each one of the Ten Commandments.

   First Note. It is to be noted that when one comes to think on a
   Commandment on which he finds he has no habit of sinning, it is not
   necessary for him to delay so much time, but according as one finds in
   himself that he stumbles more or less on that Commandment so he ought
   to keep himself more or less on the consideration and examination of
   it. And the same is to be observed on the Deadly Sins.

   Second Note. After having finished the discussion already mentioned on
   all the Commandments, accusing myself on them and asking grace and help
   to amend hereafter, I am to finish with a Colloquy to God our Lord,
   according to the subject matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

    II. On Deadly Sins

   About the Seven Deadly Sins, after the Addition, let the Preparatory
   Prayer be made in the way already mentioned, only with the difference
   that the matter here is of sins that have to be avoided, and before of
   Commandments that have to be kept: and likewise let the order and rule
   already mentioned be kept, and the Colloquy.

   In order to know better the faults committed in the Deadly Sins, let
   their contraries be looked at: and so, to avoid them better, let the
   person purpose and with holy exercises see to acquiring and keeping the
   seven virtues contrary to them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    III. On the Powers of the Soul

   Way. On the three powers of the soul let the same order and rule be
   kept as on the Commandments, making its Addition, Preparatory Prayer
   and Colloquy.
     __________________________________________________________________

    IV. On the Bodily Senses

   Way. About the five bodily senses the same order always will be kept,
   but changing their matter.

   Note. Whoever wants to imitate Christ our Lord in the use of his
   senses, let him in the Preparatory Prayer recommend himself to His
   Divine Majesty, and after considering on each sense, say a Hail Mary or
   an Our Father.

   And whoever wants to imitate Our Lady in the use of the senses, let him
   in the Preparatory Prayer recommend himself to her, that she may get
   him grace from Her Son and Lord for it; and after considering on each
   sense, say a Hail Mary.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECOND METHOD OF PRAYER

   It is by contemplating the meaning of each word of the Prayer.

   Addition. The same Addition which was in the First Method of Prayer
   will be in this second.

   Prayer. The Preparatory Prayer will be made according to the person to
   whom the prayer is addressed.

   Second Method of Prayer. The Second Method of Prayer is that the
   person, kneeling or seated, according to the greater disposition in
   which he finds himself and as more devotion accompanies him, keeping
   the eyes closed or fixed on one place, without going wandering with
   them, says Father, and is on the consideration of this word as long as
   he finds meanings, comparisons, relish and consolation in
   considerations pertaining to such word. And let him do in the same way
   on each word of the Our Father, or of any other prayer which he wants
   to say in this way.

   First Rule. The first Rule is that he will be an hour on the whole Our
   Father in the manner already mentioned. Which finished, he will say a
   Hail Mary, Creed, Soul of Christ, and Hail, Holy Queen, vocally or
   mentally, according to the usual way.

   Second Rule. The Second Rule is that, should the person who is
   contemplating the Our Father find in one word, or in two, matter so
   good to think over, and relish and consolation, let him not care to
   pass on, although the hour ends on what he finds. The hour finished, he
   will say the rest of the Our Father in the usual way.

   Third Rule. The third is that if on one word or two of the Our Father
   one has lingered for a whole hour, when he will want to come back
   another day to the prayer, let him say the above-mentioned word, or the
   two, as he is accustomed; and on the word which immediately follows let
   him commence to contemplate, according as was said in the second Rule.

   First Note. It is to be noted that, the Our Father finished, in one or
   in many days, the same has to be done with the Hail Mary and then with
   the other prayers, so that for some time one is always exercising
   himself in one of them.

   Second Note. The second note is that, the prayer finished, turning, in
   few words, to the person to whom he has prayed, let him ask for the
   virtues or graces of which he feels he has most need.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THIRD METHOD OF PRAYER

   It will be by rhythm.

   Addition. The Addition will be the same as in the First and Second
   Methods of Prayer.

   Prayer. The Preparatory Prayer will be as in the Second Method of
   Prayer.

   Third Method of Prayer. The Third Method of Prayer is that with each
   breath in or out, one has to pray mentally, saying one word of the Our
   Father, or of another prayer which is being recited: so that only one
   word be said between one breath and another, and while the time from
   one breath to another lasts, let attention be given chiefly to the
   meaning of such word, or to the person to whom he recites it, or to his
   own baseness, or to the difference from such great height to his own so
   great lowness. And in the same form and rule he will proceed on the
   other words of the Our Father; and the other prayers, that is to say,
   the Hail Mary, the Soul of Christ, the Creed, and the Hail, Holy Queen,
   he will make as he is accustomed.

   First Rule. The First Rule is, on the other day, or at another hour,
   that he wants to pray, let him say the Hail Mary in rhythm, and the
   other prayers as he is accustomed; and so on, going through the others.

   Second Rule. The second is that whoever wants to dwell more on the
   prayer by rhythm, can say all the above-mentioned prayers or part of
   them, keeping the same order of the breath by rhythm, as has been
   explained.
     __________________________________________________________________

                  THE MYSTERIES OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST OUR LORD

   Note. It is to be noted in all the following Mysteries, that all the
   words which are inclosed in parentheses [23] are from the Gospel itself
   and not those which are outside.

   And in each Mystery, for the most part, three Points will be found to

     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] It appears that is in the Saint's handwriting, inserted before He
   exercised.

   St. John, and Matthew as Matthew himself says in the ninth Chapter.

   Third Point. Third: He called the other Apostles, of whose special call
   the Gospel does not make mention.

   And three other things also would be to be considered:

   The first, how the Apostles were of uneducated and low condition;

   The second, the dignity to which they were so sweetly called;

   The third, the gifts and graces by which they were raised above all the
   Fathers of the New and Old Testaments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and
   glorify your Father Who is in the heavens.'"

   Third Point. Third: He shows Himself not a transgressor, but a
   perfector of the law; explaining the precept of not killing, not

  OF HOW CHRIST WALKED ON THE SEA

   St. Matthew writes Chapter 14 [22-34].

   commenced to wash them with tears and dried them with the hairs of her
   head, and kissed His feet and anointed them with ointment.

   tabernacles, a voice from heaven sounded, which said: "This is My

   fell for fear on their faces; and Christ our Lord touched them and said
   to them: " Arise and fear not. Tell this vision to no one until the Son
   of Man be risen.'"
     __________________________________________________________________

  OF THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARUS

   John, Chapter 11 [1-46].

   First Point. First: Martha and Mary sent word to Christ our Lord of the
   illness of Lazarus. Knowing it, He delayed for two days, that the
   miracle might be more evident.

   other to believe, saying: "I am the resurrection and life; he who
   believeth in Me, although he be dead, shall live.'"

  OF THE SUPPER

   Matthew 26; John 13.

   First Point. First: He ate the Paschal Lamb with His twelve Apostles,
   to whom He foretold His death. "In truth, I say to you that one of you
   is to sell Me.'"

   Second Point. Second: He washed the Disciples' feet, even those of
   Judas, commencing from St. Peter, who, considering the Majesty of the
   Lord and his own baseness, not wanting to consent, said: "Lord, dost
   Thou wash my feet?" But St. Peter did not know that in that He gave an
   example of humility, and for this He said: "I have given you an
   example, that you may do as I did.'"

   Third Point. Third: He instituted the most sacred sacrifice of the
   Eucharist, to be the greatest mark of His love, saying: "Take and
   eat.'" The Supper finished, Judas went forth to sell Christ our Lord.

   First Point. First: The Supper finished, and singing the hymn, the Lord

   to pray.'"

   Second Point. Second: Accompanied by St. Peter, St. James and St. John,
   He prayed three times to the Lord, saying: "Father, if it be possible,
   let this chalice pass from Me. Nevertheless, let not My will be done,
   but Thine.'" And being in agony, He prayed the longer.

   Third Point. Third: He came into such fear, that He said: "My soul is
   sorrowful unto death,'" and He sweated blood so plentiful, that St.
   Luke says: "His sweat was as drops of blood which were running on the
   earth;" which supposes that the garments were already full of blood.

   ye?" the enemies fell on the earth.

  OF THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST OUR LORD

   Acts 1 [1-12].

                                     RULES
     __________________________________________________________________

FOR PERCEIVING AND KNOWING IN SOME MANNER THE DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE
CAUSED IN THE SOUL

  THE GOOD, TO RECEIVE THEM, AND THE BAD

  TO REJECT THEM. AND THEY ARE MORE

  PROPER FOR THE FIRST WEEK.

   First Rule. The first Rule: In the persons who go from mortal sin to
   mortal sin, the enemy is commonly used to propose to them apparent
   pleasures, making them imagine sensual delights and pleasures in order
   to hold them more and make them grow in their vices and sins. In these
   persons the good spirit uses the opposite method, pricking them and
   biting their consciences through the process of reason.

   Second Rule. The second: In the persons who are going on intensely
   cleansing their sins and rising from good to better in the service of
   God our Lord, it is the method contrary to that in the first Rule, for
   then it is the way of the evil spirit to bite, sadden and put
   obstacles, disquieting with false reasons, that one may not go on; and
   it is proper to the good to give courage and strength, consolations,
   tears, inspirations and quiet, easing, and putting away all obstacles,
   that one may go on in well doing.

   Third Rule. The third: Of Spiritual Consolation. I call it consolation
   when some interior movement in the soul is caused, through which the
   soul comes to be inflamed with love of its Creator and Lord; and when
   it can in consequence love no created thing on the face of the earth in
   itself, but in the Creator of them all.

   Likewise, when it sheds tears that move to love of its Lord, whether
   out of sorrow for one's sins, or for the Passion of Christ our Lord, or
   because of other things directly connected with His service and praise.

   Finally, I call consolation every increase of hope, faith and charity,
   and all interior joy which calls and attracts to heavenly things and to
   the salvation of one's soul, quieting it and giving it peace in its
   Creator and Lord.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth: Of Spiritual Desolation. I call desolation all
   the contrary of the third [36] rule, such as darkness [37] of soul,
   disturbance in it, movement to things low and earthly, the unquiet of
   different agitations and temptations, moving to want of confidence,
   without hope, without love, when one finds oneself all lazy, tepid,
   sad, and as if separated from his Creator and Lord. Because, as
   consolation is contrary to desolation, in the same way the thoughts
   which come from consolation are contrary to the thoughts which come
   from desolation.

   Fifth Rule. The fifth: In time of desolation never to make a change;
   but to be firm and constant in the resolutions and determination in
   which one was the day preceding such desolation, or in the
   determination in which he was in the preceding consolation. Because, as
   in consolation it is rather the good spirit who guides and counsels us,
   so in desolation it is the bad, with whose counsels we cannot take a
   course to decide rightly.

   Sixth Rule. The sixth: Although in desolation we ought not to change
   our first resolutions, it is very helpful intensely to change ourselves
   against the same desolation, as by insisting more on prayer,
   meditation, on much examination, and by giving ourselves more scope in
   some suitable way of doing penance.

   Seventh Rule. The seventh: Let him who is in desolation consider how
   the Lord has left him in trial in his natural powers, in order to
   resist the different agitations and temptations of the enemy; since he
   can with the Divine help, which always remains to him, though he does
   not clearly perceive it: because the Lord has taken from him his great
   fervor, great love and intense grace, leaving him, however, grace
   enough for eternal salvation.

   Eighth Rule. The eighth: Let him who is in desolation labor to be in
   patience, which is contrary to the vexations which come to him: and let
   him think that he will soon be consoled, employing against the
   desolation the devices, as is said in the sixth Rule. [38]

   Ninth Rule. The ninth: There are three principal reasons why we find
   ourselves desolate.

   The first is, because of our being tepid, lazy or negligent in our
   spiritual exercises; and so through our faults, spiritual consolation
   withdraws from us.

   The second, to try us and see how much we are and how much we let
   ourselves out in His service and praise without such great pay of
   consolation and great graces.

   The third, to give us true acquaintance and knowledge, that we may
   interiorly feel that it is not ours to get or keep great devotion,
   intense love, tears, or any other spiritual consolation, but that all
   is the gift and grace of God our Lord, and that we may not build a nest
   in a thing not ours, raising our intellect into some pride or
   vainglory, attributing to us devotion or the other things of the
   spiritual consolation.

   Tenth Rule. The tenth: Let him who is in consolation think how he will
   be in the desolation which will come after, taking new strength for
   then.

   Eleventh Rule. The eleventh: Let him who is consoled see to humbling
   himself and lowering himself as much as he can, thinking how little he
   is able for in the time of desolation without such grace or
   consolation.

   On the contrary, let him who is in desolation think that he can do much
   with the grace sufficient to resist all his enemies, taking strength in
   his Creator and Lord.

   Twelfth Rule. The twelfth: The enemy acts like a woman, in being weak
   against vigor and strong of will. Because, as it is the way of the
   woman when she is quarrelling with some man to lose heart, taking
   flight when the man shows her much courage: and on the contrary, if the
   man, losing heart, begins to fly, the wrath, revenge, and ferocity of
   the woman is very great, and so without bounds; in the same manner, it
   is the way of the enemy to weaken and lose heart, his temptations
   taking flight, when the person who is exercising himself in spiritual
   things opposes a bold front against the temptations of the enemy, doing
   diametrically the opposite. And on the contrary, if the person who is
   exercising himself commences to have fear and lose heart in suffering
   the temptations, there is no beast so wild on the face of the earth as
   the enemy of human nature in following out his damnable intention with
   so great malice.

   Thirteenth Rule. The thirteenth: Likewise, he acts as a licentious
   lover in wanting to be secret and not revealed. For, as the licentious
   man who, speaking for an evil purpose, solicits a daughter of a good
   father or a wife of a good husband, wants his words and persuasions to
   be secret, and the contrary displeases him much, when the daughter
   reveals to her father or the wife to her husband his licentious words
   and depraved intention, because he easily gathers that he will not be
   able to succeed with the undertaking begun: in the same way, when the
   enemy of human nature brings his wiles and persuasions to the just
   soul, he wants and desires that they be received and kept in secret;
   but when one reveals them to his good Confessor or to another spiritual
   person that knows his deceits and evil ends, it is very grievous to
   him, because he gathers, from his manifest deceits being discovered,
   that he will not be able to succeed with his wickedness begun.

   Fourteenth Rule. The fourteenth: Likewise, he behaves as a chief bent
   on conquering and robbing what he desires: for, as a captain and chief
   of the army, pitching his camp, and looking at the forces or defences
   of a stronghold, attacks it on the weakest side, in like manner the
   enemy of human nature, roaming about, looks in turn at all our virtues,
   theological, cardinal and moral; and where he finds us weakest and most
   in need for our eternal salvation, there he attacks us and aims at
   taking us.

   Rule.
     __________________________________________________________________

RULES FOR THE SAME EFFECT WITH GREATER DISCERNMENT OF SPIRITS

  AND THEY HELP MORE FOR THE SECOND WEEK

   First Rule. The first: It is proper to God and to His Angels in their
   movements to give true spiritual gladness and joy, taking away all
   sadness and disturbance which the enemy brings on. Of this latter it is
   proper to fight against the spiritual gladness and consolation,
   bringing apparent reasons, subtleties and continual fallacies.

   Second Rule. The second: It belongs to God our Lord to give consolation
   to the soul without preceding cause, for it is the property of the
   Creator to enter, go out and cause movements in the soul, bringing it
   all into love of His Divine Majesty. I say without cause: without any
   previous sense or knowledge of any object through which such
   consolation would come, through one's acts of understanding and will.

   Third Rule. The third: With cause, as well the good Angel as the bad
   can console the soul, for contrary ends: the good Angel for the profit
   of the soul, that it may grow and rise from good to better, and the
   evil Angel, for the contrary, and later on to draw it to his damnable
   intention and wickedness.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth: It is proper to the evil Angel, who forms
   himself under the appearance of an angel of light, to enter with the
   devout soul and go out with himself: that is to say, to bring good and
   holy thoughts, conformable to such just soul, and then little by little
   he aims at coming out drawing the soul to his covert deceits and
   perverse intentions.

   Fifth Rule. The fifth: We ought to note well the course of the
   thoughts, and if the beginning, middle and end is all good, inclined to
   all good, it is a sign of the good Angel; but if in the course of the
   thoughts which he brings it ends in something bad, of a distracting
   tendency, or less good than what the soul had previously proposed to
   do, or if it weakens it or disquiets or disturbs the soul, taking away
   its peace, tranquillity and quiet, which it had before, it is a clear
   sign that it proceeds from the evil spirit, enemy of our profit and
   eternal salvation.

   Sixth Rule. The sixth: When the enemy of human nature has been
   perceived and known by his serpent's tail and the bad end to which he
   leads on, it helps the person who was tempted by him, to look
   immediately at the course of the good thoughts which he brought him at
   their beginning, and how little by little he aimed at making him
   descend from the spiritual sweetness and joy in which he was, so far as
   to bring him to his depraved intention; in order that with this
   experience, known and noted, the person may be able to guard for the
   future against his usual deceits.

   Seventh Rule. The seventh: In those who go on from good to better, the
   good Angel touches such soul sweetly, lightly and gently, like a drop
   of water which enters into a sponge; and the evil touches it sharply
   and with noise and disquiet, as when the drop of water falls on the
   stone.

   And the above-said spirits touch in a contrary way those who go on from
   bad to worse.

   The reason of this is that the disposition of the soul is contrary or
   like to the said Angels. Because, when it is contrary, they enter
   perceptibly with clatter and noise; and when it is like, they enter
   with silence as into their own home, through the open door.

   Eighth Rule. The eighth: When the consolation is without cause,
   although there be no deceit in it, as being of God our Lord alone, as
   was said; still the spiritual person to whom God gives such
   consolation, ought, with much vigilance and attention, to look at and
   distinguish the time itself of such actual consolation from the
   following, in which the soul remains warm and favored with the favor
   and remnants of the consolation past; for often in this second time,
   through one's own course of habits and the consequences of the concepts
   and judgments, or through the good spirit or through the bad, he forms
   various resolutions and opinions which are not given immediately by God
   our Lord, and therefore they have need to be very well examined before
   entire credit is given them, or they are put into effect.
     __________________________________________________________________

IN THE MINISTRY OF DISTRIBUTING ALMS

  THE FOLLOWING RULES SHOULD BE KEPT

   First Rule. The first: If I make the distribution to relatives or
   friends, or to persons for whom I have an affection, I shall have four
   things to see to, of which mention was made, in part, in the matter of
   Election.

   The first is, that that love which moves me and makes me give the alms,
   should descend from above, from the love of God our Lord, so that I
   feel first in me that the love, more or less, which I have to such
   persons is for God; and that in the reason why I love them more, God
   appears.

   Second Rule. The second: I want to set before me a man whom I have
   never seen or known, and desiring all his perfection in the ministry
   and condition which he has, as I would want him to keep the mean in his
   manner of distributing, for the greater glory of God our Lord and the
   greater perfection of his soul; I, doing so, neither more nor less,
   will keep the rule and measure which I should want and judge to be
   right for the other.

   Third Rule. The third: I want to consider, as if I were at the point of
   death, the form and measure which then I should want to have kept in
   the office of my administration, and regulating myself by that, to keep
   it in the acts of my distribution.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth: Looking how I shall find myself on the Day of
   Judgment, to think well how then I should want to have used this office
   and charge of administration; and the rule which then I should want to
   have kept, to keep it now.

   Fifth Rule. The fifth: When some person feels himself inclined and
   drawn to some persons to whom he wants to distribute alms, let him hold
   himself back and ponder well the above-mentioned four Rules, examining
   and testing his affection by them; and not give the alms until,
   conformably to them, he has in all dismissed and cast out his
   disordered inclination.

   Sixth Rule. The sixth: Although there is no fault in taking the goods
   of God our Lord to distribute them, when the person is called by God
   our Lord to such ministry; still in the quantity of what he has to take
   and apply to himself out of what he has to give to others, there may be
   doubt as to fault and excess. Therefore, he can reform in his life and
   condition by the above-mentioned Rules.

   Seventh Rule. The seventh: For the reasons already mentioned and for
   many others, it is always better and more secure in what touches one's
   person and condition of life to spare more and diminish and approach
   more to our High Priest, our model and rule, who is Christ our Lord;
   conformably to what the third Council of Carthage, in which St.
   Augustine was, determines and orders--that the furniture of the Bishop
   be cheap and poor. The same should be considered in all manners of
   life, looking at and deciding according to the condition and state of
   the persons; as in married life we have the example of St. Joachim and
   of St. Ann, who, dividing their means into three parts, gave the first
   to the poor, and the second to the ministry and service of the Temple,
   and took the third for the support of themselves and of their
   household.

THE FOLLOWING NOTES HELP TO PERCEIVE AND UNDERSTAND SCRUPLES

  AND PERSUASIONS OF OUR ENEMY

   First Note. The first: They commonly call a scruple what proceeds from
   our own judgment and freedom: that is to say, when I freely decide that
   that is sin which is not sin, as when it happens that after some one
   has accidentally stepped on a cross of straw, he decides with his own
   judgment that he has sinned.

   This is properly an erroneous judgment and not a real scruple.

   Second Note. The second: After I have stepped on that cross, or after I
   have thought or said or done some other thing, there comes to me a
   thought from without that I have sinned, and on the other hand it
   appears to me that I have not sinned; still I feel disturbance in this;
   that is to say, in as much as I doubt and in as much as I do not doubt.

   That is a real scruple and temptation which the enemy sets.

   Third Note. Third: The first scruple--of the first note--is much to be
   abhorred, because it is all error; but the second--of the second
   note--for some space of time is of no little profit to the soul which
   is giving itself to spiritual exercises; [39] rather in great manner it
   purifies and cleanses such a soul, separating it much from all
   appearance of sin: according to that saying of Gregory: "It belongs to
   good minds to see a fault where there is no fault."

   Fourth Note. The fourth: The enemy looks much if a soul is gross or
   delicate, and if it is delicate, he tries to make it more delicate in
   the extreme, to disturb and embarrass it more. For instance, if he sees
   that a soul does not consent to either mortal sin or venial or any
   appearance of deliberate sin, then the enemy, when he cannot make it
   fall into a thing that appears sin, aims at making it make out sin
   where there is not sin, as in a word or very small thought.

   If the soul is gross, the enemy tries to make it more gross; for
   instance, if before it made no account of venial sins, he will try to
   have it make little account of mortal sins, and if before it made some
   account, he will try to have it now make much less or none.

   Fifth Note. The fifth: The soul which desires to benefit itself in the
   spiritual life, ought always to proceed the contrary way to what the
   enemy proceeds; that is to say, if the enemy wants to make the soul
   gross, let it aim at making itself delicate. Likewise, if the enemy
   tries to draw it out to extreme fineness, let the soul try to establish
   itself in the mean, in order to quiet itself in everything.

   Sixth Note. The sixth: When such good soul wants to speak or do
   something within the Church, within the understanding of our Superiors,
   and which should be for the glory of God our Lord, and there comes to
   him a thought or temptation from without that he should neither say nor
   do that thing--bringing to him apparent reasons of vainglory or of
   another thing, etc.,--then he ought to raise his understanding to his
   Creator and Lord, and if he sees that it is His due service, or at the
   least not contrary to it, he ought to act diametrically against such
   temptation, according to St. Bernard, answering the same: "Neither for
   thee did I begin, nor for thee will I stop."

TO HAVE THE TRUE SENTIMENT

  WHICH WE OUGHT TO HAVE IN THE CHURCH

  MILITANT

   Let the following Rules be observed.

   First Rule. The first: All judgment laid aside, we ought to have our
   mind ready and prompt to obey, in all, the true Spouse of Christ our
   Lord, which is our holy Mother the Church Hierarchical.

   Second Rule. The second: To praise confession to a Priest, and the
   reception of the most Holy Sacrament of the Altar once in the year, and
   much more each month, and much better from week to week, with the
   conditions required and due.

   Third Rule. The third: To praise the hearing of Mass often, likewise
   [40] hymns, psalms, and long prayers, in the church and out of it;
   likewise the hours set at the time fixed for each Divine Office and for
   all prayer and all Canonical Hours.

   Fourth Rule. The fourth: To praise much Religious Orders, virginity and
   continence, and not so much marriage as any of these.

   Fifth Rule. The fifth: To praise vows of Religion, of obedience, of
   poverty, of chastity and of other perfections of supererogation. And it
   is to be noted that as the vow is about the things which approach to
   Evangelical perfection, a vow ought not to be made in the things which
   withdraw from it, such as to be a merchant, or to be married, etc.

   Sixth Rule. To praise relics of the Saints, giving veneration to them
   and praying to the Saints; and to praise Stations, pilgrimages,
   Indulgences, pardons, Cruzadas, and candles lighted in the churches.

   Seventh Rule. To praise Constitutions about fasts and abstinence, as of
   Lent, Ember Days, Vigils, Friday and Saturday; likewise penances, not
   only interior, but also exterior.

   Eighth Rule. To praise the ornaments and the buildings of churches;
   likewise images, and to venerate them according to what they represent.

   Ninth Rule. Finally, to praise all precepts of the Church, keeping the
   mind prompt to find reasons in their defence and in no manner against
   them.

   Tenth Rule. We ought to be more prompt to find good and praise as well
   the Constitutions and recommendations as the ways of our Superiors.
   Because, although some are not or have not been such, to speak against
   them, whether preaching in public or discoursing before the common
   people, would rather give rise to fault-finding and scandal than
   profit; and so the people would be incensed against their Superiors,
   whether temporal or spiritual. So that, as it does harm to speak evil
   to the common people of Superiors in their absence, so it can make
   profit to speak of the evil ways to the persons themselves who can
   remedy them.

   Eleventh Rule. To praise positive and scholastic learning. Because, as
   it is more proper to the Positive Doctors, as St. Jerome, St. Augustine
   and St. Gregory, etc., to move the heart to love and serve God our Lord
   in everything; so it is more proper to the Scholastics, as St. Thomas,
   St. Bonaventure, and to the Master of the Sentences, etc., to define or
   explain for our times [41] the things necessary for eternal salvation;
   and to combat and explain better all errors and all fallacies. For the
   Scholastic Doctors, as they are more modern, not only help themselves
   with the true understanding of the Sacred Scripture and of the Positive
   and holy Doctors, but also, they being enlightened and clarified by the
   Divine virtue, help themselves by the Councils, Canons and
   Constitutions of our holy Mother the Church.

   Twelfth Rule. We ought to be on our guard in making comparison of those
   of us who are alive to the blessed passed away, because error is
   committed not a little in this; that is to say, in saying, this one
   knows more than St. Augustine; he is another, or greater than, St.
   Francis; he is another St. Paul in goodness, holiness, etc.

   Thirteenth Rule. To be right in everything, we ought always to hold
   that the white which I see, is black, if the Hierarchical Church so
   decides it, believing that between Christ our Lord, the Bridegroom, and
   the Church, His Bride, there is the same Spirit which governs and
   directs us for the salvation of our souls. Because by the same Spirit
   and our Lord Who gave the ten Commandments, our holy Mother the Church
   is directed and governed.

   Fourteenth Rule. Although there is much truth in the assertion that no
   one can save himself without being predestined and without having faith
   and grace; we must be very cautious in the manner of speaking and
   communicating with others about all these things.

   Fifteenth Rule. We ought not, by way of custom, to speak much of
   predestination; but if in some way and at some times one speaks, let
   him so speak that the common people may not come into any error, as
   sometimes happens, saying: Whether I have to be saved or condemned is
   already determined, and no other thing can now be, through my doing
   well or ill; and with this, growing lazy, they become negligent in the
   works which lead to the salvation and the spiritual [42] profit of
   their souls.

   Sixteenth Rule. In the same way, we must be on our guard that by
   talking much and with much insistence of faith, without any distinction
   and explanation, occasion be not given to the people to be lazy and
   slothful in works, whether before faith is formed in charity or after.

   Seventeenth Rule. Likewise, we ought not to speak so much with
   insistence on grace that the poison of discarding liberty be
   engendered.

   So that of faith and grace one can speak as much as is possible with
   the Divine help for the greater praise of His Divine Majesty, but not
   in such way, nor in such manners, especially in our so dangerous times,
   that works and free will receive any harm, or be held for nothing.

   Eighteenth Rule. Although serving God our Lord much out of pure love is
   to be esteemed above all; we ought to praise much the fear of His
   Divine Majesty, because not only filial fear is a thing pious and most
   holy, but even servile fear--when the man reaches nothing else better
   or more useful--helps much to get out of mortal sin. And when he is
   out, he easily comes to filial fear, which is all acceptable and
   grateful to God our Lord: as being at one with the Divine Love.
