   The Latin of this edition of the life of St. Benedict by St. Gregory
   the Great, is from that used by dom. Edmund Mart√†ne, the English is
   almost exactly that of the quaint translation published in 1638. The
   test used for the Holy Rule is that of an ancient MS. existing at Monte
   Cassino, first published in 1659 by Dom. Paul de Ferrariis, a monk of
   that Abbey. The English is, as far as is consistent with the original,
   from the time honoured translation of 1638, as edited in 1875 by "one
   of the Benedictine Fathers of St. Michael's, near Hereford."

  INTRODUCTION.

   THERE was a man of venerable life, Benedict by name and grace, who from
   the time of his very childhood carried the heart of an old man. His
   demeanour indeed surpassing his age, he gave himself no disport or
   pleasure, but living here upon earth he despised the world with all the
   glory thereof, at such time as he might have most freely enjoyed it. He
   was born in the province of Nursia of honourable parentage and sent to
   Rome to study the liberal sciences. But when he saw there many through
   the uneven paths of vice run headlong to their own ruin, he drew back
   his foot, but new-set in the world, lest, in the search of human
   knowledge, he might also fall into the same dangerous precipice.
   Contemning therefore learning and studies and abandoning his father's
   house and goods, he desired only to please God in a virtuous life.
   Therefore he departed skilfully ignorant and wisely unlearned. I have
   not attained unto all this man did, but the few things which I here set
   down, were related to me by four of his disciples; namely, Constantine,
   a very reverend man, who succeeded him in the government of the
   Monastery; Valentinian, who for many years bore rule in the Monastery
   of Lateran; Simplicius, who was the third superior of that congregation
   after him; and Honoratus who yet governeth the Monastery which he first
   inhabited.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   Benedict having now left the schools resolved to betake himself to the
   desert, accompanied only by his nurse who most tenderly loved him.
   Coming therefore to a place called Affile, and remaining for some time
   in the Church of St. Peter by the charitable invitement of many
   virtuous people who lived there for devotion, so it chanced that his
   nurse borrowed of a neighbour a sieve to cleanse wheat, which being
   left carelessly upon the table was found broken in two pieces.
   Therefore on her return finding it broke, she began to weep bitterly
   because it was only lent her. But the religious and pious boy,
   Benedict, seeing his nurse lament was moved with compassion, and taking
   with him the two pieces of the broken sieve, with tears he gave himself
   to prayer, which no sooner ended, but he found the sieve whole, and
   found not any sign that it had been broken. Then presently he restored
   the sieve which had been broken, whole to his nurse, to her exceeding
   comfort. This matter was divulged unto all that lived thereabout, and
   so much admired by all, that the inhabitants of that place caused the
   sieve to be hanged up in the Church porch, that not only those present,
   but all posterity might know with how great gifts of grace Benedict had
   been endowed from the beginning of his conversion. The sieve remained
   to be seen for many years after, and hung over the Church door even
   until the times of the Longobards.

   But Benedict more desirous to suffer afflictions than covetous of
   praise; and rather willing to undergo labours for the honour of God,
   than to be extolled with the favours of this world, fled secretly from
   his nurse to a remote place in the desert called Subiaco, distant about
   forty miles from Rome, in which a fountain springing with cool and
   crystal waters, extendeth itself at first into a broad lake, and
   running farther with increase of waters becometh at the last a river.
   As he was travelling to this place, a certain monk called Romanus met
   him and asked whither he was going. Having understood his intention, he
   both kept it secret and afforded him help, moreover he gave him a
   religious habit and assisted him in all things. The man of God being
   come to this place lived for the space of three years in an obscure
   cave, unknown to any man except Romanus the Monk, who lived not far off
   in a Monastery governed by Father Deodatus. But he would piously steal
   forth, and on certain days bring to Benedict a loaf of bread which he
   had spared from his own allowance. But there being no way to the cave
   from Romanus his cell by reason of a steep and high rock which hung
   over it, Romanus used to let down the loaf by a long cord to which also
   he fastened a little bell, that by the sound of it, the man of God
   might know when Romanus brought him the bread, and going out may
   receive it. But the old enemy, envying the charity of the one and the
   refection of the other, when on a certain day he beheld the bread let
   down in this manner, threw a stone and brake the bell. Notwithstanding,
   Romanus afterwards failed not to assist him in the best manner he was
   able. Now when it pleased Almighty God that Romanus should rest from
   his labours, and that the life of Benedict should be manifest to the
   world for an example to all men, that the candle set upon a candlestick
   might shine and give light to the whole Church of God, our Lord
   vouchsafed to appear to a certain Priest living far off, who had make
   ready his dinner for Easter Day, saying to him: "Thou hast prepared
   good cheer for thyself, and My servant in such a place is famished for
   hunger." Who presently rose up, and on the solemn day of Easter went
   towards the place with such meat as he had provided for himself, where
   seeking the man of God, amongst craggy rocks, winding valleys and
   hollow pits he found him hid in a cave. Then after prayers, and
   blessing the Almighty Lord, they sat down, and after some spiritual
   discourse the Priest said: "Rise, and let us take our refection, for
   this is Easter Day." To whom the man of God answered: "I know it is
   Easter, because I have found so much favour as to see thee." (For not
   having a long time conversed with men, he did not know it was Easter
   Day.) The good Priest did therefore again affirm it, saying: "Truly
   this is the day of our Lord's Resurrection, and therefore it is not fit
   that you should keep abstinence, and for this cause I am sent that we
   may eat together that which Almighty God hath bestowed on us."
   Whereupon blessing God, they fell to their meat. Their discourse and
   dinner ended, the Priest returned to his Church.

   About the same time certain shepherds found him hid in a cave; who, at
   the first, spying him among the bushes, clothed in the skins of beasts,
   took him for some wild beast, but afterwards knowing him to be a
   servant of God, many of them were converted from their savage life to
   virtue. By this means his name began to be famous in the country, and
   many did resort unto him, bringing with them necessaries for his body,
   while they received from his lips the food of life.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   How he overcame a temptation of the flesh.

   The holy man being on a certain day alone, the tempter was at hand; for
   a little black bird, commonly called an ousel, began to fly about his
   face, and that so near as the holy man, if he would. might have taken
   it with his hand; but no sooner had he made the sign of the cross than
   the bird vanished. When presently so great a carnal temptation assailed
   him, that before the holy man had never felt the like. For the
   remembrance of a woman which some time he had seen, was so lively
   represented to his fancy by the wicked spirit, and so vehemently did
   her image inflame his breast with lustful desires, that almost overcome
   by pleasure, he was determining to leave the wilderness. But suddenly
   assisted with divine grace he came to himself, and, seeing near him a
   thicket full of nettles and briars, he threw off his garments and cast
   himself naked into the midst of those sharp thorns and nettles, where
   he rolled himself so long, that, when he rose up, all his body was
   pitifully rent; thus by the wounds of his flesh he cured those of his
   soul, by turning pleasure into pain; and by the vehemence of outward
   torments he extinguished the unlawful flame which burnt within
   overcoming sin by changing the fire. After which time, as he himself
   related to his disciples, he was so free from the like temptation, that
   he never felt any such motion.

   Many after this began to forsake the world and to hasten to put
   themselves under his government. Being now altogether free from vice,
   he worthily deserved to be made a master of virtue. As it is commanded
   by Moses that the Levites should serve from five and twenty years and
   upward, and after fifty years they should be appointed to keep the holy
   vessels.

   PETER.

   I have already understood something of this testimony alleged, yet I
   pray make it more plain unto me.

   GREGORY.

   It is manifest, Peter, that in youth the temptations of the flesh are
   great, but after fifty natural heat waxeth cold: now the souls of good
   men are the holy vessels. Therefore while the elect are in temptation,
   it is necessary that they live under obedience, and be wearied with
   labours, but when, by reason of their age, the fervour of temptations
   is assuaged, they are ordained keepers of holy vessels, that is become
   instructors of souls.

   PETER.

   I confess what you say has given me full satisfaction, and therefore
   this place of Scripture being clearly expounded, I pray you hasten on
   with the holy man's life which you have begun.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER III.

   How St. Benedict brake a glass by the sign of the cross.

   Having thus vanquished this temptation, the man of God like a good soil
   well manured and weeded, brought forth abundant fruit of the seed of
   virtue, so that his fame began to spread itself more largely. Not far
   off was a Monastery, whose Abbot being dead, the whole Convent repaired
   to the venerable man Benedict, and with earnest persuasions requested
   him for their Abbot, which he refused for a long time, forewarning them
   that his manner of life and theirs were not agreeable; yet at length
   overcome with importunity he gave consent. But when in the same
   Monastery he began to observe regular discipline, so that none of the
   Monks (as in former time) were permitted by their disorder to swerve
   any way form the path of virtue, which receiving they fell into a great
   rage, and began accusing themselves of their choice in receiving him
   for a Superior, whose integrity of life was disproportionate to their
   perverseness.

   And therefore, when they perceived themselves restrained from unlawful
   acts, it grieved them to leave their desires, and hard it was to
   relinquish old customs and begin a new life, besides the conversation
   of good men is always odious to the wicked, they began therefore to
   plot his death, and after consultation had together, they poisoned his
   wine. So when the glass which contained the empoisoned drink was,
   according to the custom of the Monastery, presented at table to be
   blessed by the Abbot, Benedict putting forth his hand and making the
   sign of the Cross, the glass which was held far off brake in pieces, as
   if instead of blessing the vase of death, he had thrown a stone against
   it. By this the man of God perceived that the glass had in it the drink
   of death which could not endure the sign of life. So presently rising
   up with a mild countenance and tranquil mind, having called the
   Brethren together, he thus spake unto them: "Almighty God of His mercy
   forgive you, Brethren, why have you dealt thus with me? Did not I
   foretell you that my manner of life and yours would not agree? Go, and
   seek a Superior to your liking; for you can have me no longer with
   you." This said, he forthwith returned to the solitude he loved so
   well, and lived there with himself, in the sight of Him who seeth all
   things.

   PETER.

   I do not well understand what you mean: "He lived with himself."

   GREGORY.

   If the holy man had been longer constrained to govern those who had
   unanimously conspired against him, and were so contrary to him in life
   and manners, it might, peradventure, have diminished his own vigour and
   fervour of devotion, withdrawing his mind from the light of
   contemplation. So that over much busied in correcting the faults of
   others, he might have neglected his own; and so perhaps lost himself,
   and yet not gained others. For as often as by contagious motions we are
   transported out of ourselves we remain the same, but not with
   ourselves, because not looking into our own actions, we are wandering
   about other things. For do we think that he was with himself who went
   into a far country, consumed the portion allotted to him, and, after he
   had put himself into the service of a citizen of that country, kept his
   hogs, and was glad to eat the husks which they are: notwithstanding,
   when he began to consider what he had lost, as the Scripture
   testifieth: "Being come to himself, he said: how many hirelings in my
   father's house have plenty of bread." If, therefore, he were before
   with himself, how was it true that he returned to himself?

   I may well say, therefore, that his holy man lived with himself,
   because he never turned the eye of his soul from himself, but standing
   always on his guard with great circumspection, he kept himself
   continually in the all-seeing eye of his Creator.

   PETER.

   How is it then to be understood, which is written of the Apostle Peter,
   when he was led by the Angel out of the prison? Who returning to
   himself said: "Now I know assuredly that the Lord hath sent his Angel,
   and hath delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the
   expectation of the people of the Jews."

   GREGORY.

   Two ways, Peter, we are carried out of ourselves: for either by
   sinfulness of thought we fall beneath ourselves, or by the grace of
   contemplation we are raised above ourselves. He therefore, that kept
   the hogs, by his inconstancy of mind and uncleanness, fell beneath
   himself: but he, whom the Angel loosed and ravished into an ecstasy,
   was indeed out of himself, but yet above himself. But both of them
   returned to themselves, the one when, reclaiming his lewd life, he was
   converted at heart, the other when from the height of contemplation, he
   returned to his natural and ordinary understanding. Thus venerable
   Benedict in that solitude dwelt with himself, for as much as he kept
   himself within his thoughts: for as often as by the fervour of
   contemplation he was elevated, without doubt he left himself as it were
   beneath himself.

   PETER.

   I like well this you say but resolve me, I pray you, should he have
   left those Monks of whom he had once taken charge?

   GREGORY.

   In my opinion, Peter, a bad community may be tolerated where there are
   found at least some good which may be helped. But where there is no
   benefit to be expected of any good, labour is many times lost upon the
   bad. Especially if there be any present occasions wherein we may do God
   better service. Now whom was there whom the holy man should have stayed
   to govern, when they had all conspired against him? And many things are
   considered by the soul of the perfect which ought not to be passed in
   silence, for they, perceiving their endeavours to be without effect,
   depart to some other place, there to employ themselves more profitably.
   Wherefore that famous preacher who desired to be dissolved and to be
   with Christ, unto whom to live is Christ, and to die is gain, did not
   only desire himself to suffer, but did also animate others to do the
   like. He being persecuted at Damascus, caused himself to be let down
   from the wall by a cord and basket whereby he escaped privately. Shall
   we say then that Paul feared death which he earnestly desired for the
   love of Christ, as appeareth by his own testimony? But as he foresaw
   that his endeavours there would profit little, with much difficulty he
   reserved himself to labour in another place with better success. For
   this valiant champion of God would not be confined to so narrow limits,
   but sought battles in the open field. So you may observe that the
   venerable Benedict, left not so many incorrigible in that place as he
   converted to a spiritual life elsewhere.

   PETER.

   You say true, as both reason and the example alleged prove, but I pray
   return to prosecute the life of this holy Father.

   GREGORY.

   The holy man for many years in that desert increased wonderfully in
   virtues and miracles, whereby a great number in those parts were
   gathered together in the service of Almighty God: so that, by the
   assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, he built there twelve monasteries,
   in each of which he put twelve Monks with their superiors, and retained
   a few with himself whom he thought to instruct further.

   Now began divers noble and devout personages from Rome to resort to
   him, and commended their children to be brought up by him in the
   service of Almighty God. At the same time, Equitius brought unto him
   Maurus, and Tertullus a Senator his son Placidus, both very hopeful
   children, of which two, Maurus, although young, yet by reason of his
   forwardness in the school of virtue, began to assist his master, but
   Placidus was as yet a child of tender years.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IV.

   How he reclaimed an indevout Monk.

   In one of those Monasteries which he had built thereabout, was a
   certain Monk that could not stay at his prayers, but, so soon as he saw
   his brethren kneel and dispose themselves for their mental prayer, he
   would go out, and there spend his wandering thoughts upon worldly and
   transitory things. For which, having been often admonished by his
   Abbot, he was brought before the man of God, who also sharply
   reprehended him for his folly; but, returning to his Monastery, he
   scarce remembered two days what the man of God had said to him, for the
   third day he fell to his old custom, and at the time of prayer went out
   again: whereof when the servant of God was informed by the Abbot the
   second time, he said: "I will come myself and reform him." And when he
   was come to the same Monastery, and the Brethren after the Psalms
   ended, at the accustomed time betook themselves to prayer, he perceived
   a little black boy, who pulled this Monk (who could not remain at his
   prayers) out by the hem of his garment. This he insinuated secretly to
   Pompeianus Abbot of the Monastery, and to Maurus: "See you not there
   who it is that draweth this Monk out?" Who answered, "No." "Let us
   pray", replied he, "that you may likewise see whom this Monk
   followeth." After prayer continued for two days, Maurus the monk saw,
   but Pompeianus the Abbot of the Monastery could not perceive anything.
   The next day when the man of God had finished his prayer he went out of
   the Oratory, and found the Monk standing without, whom he forthwith
   strake with a wand, and from that time ever after the Monk was free
   form the wicked suggestion of the black boy, and remained constant at
   his prayers. For the old enemy, as if himself had been beaten with the
   whip, dared no more to take command of his thoughts.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   How by the prayer of the man of God a spring issued from the top of a
   mountain.

   Three of the Monasteries, which he founded in that place, were built
   upon the cliffs of a mountain, which was very troublesome to the Monks
   always to be forced to descend to the lake to fetch up their water,
   for, on account of the steepness of the mountain side, it was very
   difficult and dangerous to descend. Hereupon the Brethren of these
   three Monasteries came together to the servant of God Benedict saying:
   "It is very troublesome to us to have daily to go down for water as far
   as the lake, and therefore the Monasteries must of necessity be removed
   to some more commodious place." He dismissed them with comfortable
   words, and at night with little Placidus, whom we mentioned before,
   went up to the rock and there prayed a long time. Having ended his
   prayers, he put three stones for a mark in the same place, and so
   unknown to all he returned to his Monastery. Next day, when the
   Brethren came again to him for want of water he said: "Go, and on the
   rock where you shall find three stones one upon another, dig a little,
   for Almighty God is able to make water spring from the top of that
   mountain, that you may be eased of this labour." When they had made a
   hollow in that place, it was immediately filled with water, which
   issueth forth so plentifully that to this day it continueth running
   down to the floor of the mountain.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VI.

   How the iron head of a bill from the bottom of the water returned to
   the handle again.

   At another time, a certain Goth poor of spirit, desirous to lead a
   religious life, repaired to the man of God, Benedict, who most
   willingly received him. One day he ordered a bill to be given to him to
   cut up brambles in a place which he intended for a garden. This place,
   which the Goth had undertaken to accommodate, was over the lake's side.
   While the Goth laboured amain in the cutting up the thick briars, the
   iron, slipping out of the handle, fell into the lake in a place so
   deep, that there was no hope to recover it. The Goth, having lost his
   bill, ran trembling to the Monk Maurus, and told him the mischance,
   confessing his fault penitently, who presently advertised Benedict the
   servant of God thereof. Immediately the man of God came himself to the
   lake, took the haft out of the Goth's hand, and cast it into the lake,
   when, behold, the iron rose up from the bottom and entered into the
   haft as before. Which he there rendered to the Goth saying: "Behold!
   work on and be not discomforted."
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VII.

   How his disciple Maurus walked on the water.

   One day as venerable Benedict was in his cell, the aforesaid young
   Placidus, a Monk of the holy man, went out to the lake to fetch water,
   and letting down the bucket to take up water, by chance fell in himself
   after it, and was presently carried away by the stream, a bow's shoot
   from the side. This accident was at the same time revealed to the man
   of God in his cell, who quickly called Maurus, saying: "Run, brother
   Maurus, for the child who went to fetch water is fallen into the lake,
   and the stream hath carried him a great way." A wonderful thing and not
   heard of since the time of Peter the Apostle! Maurus having asked and
   received his benediction, upon the command of his Superior went forth
   in haste, and, being come to the place to which the child was driven by
   the stream, thinking still he went upon the dry land, he ran upon the
   water, took him by the hair of the head, and returned speedily back. No
   sooner had he set foot upon firm ground but he came to himself, and
   perceiving that he had gone upon the water, much astonished, he
   wondered how he had done that which wittingly he durst not adventure.
   So, returning to his Superior, he related what had happened, which the
   venerable man Benedict ascribed to Maurus his prompt obedience, and not
   to his own merits; but contrariwise Maurus attributed it wholly to his
   command, not imputing any virtue to himself in that which he had done
   unwittingly. This humble and charitable contention, the child who was
   saved, was to decide, for he said: "When I was drawn out of the water,
   methought I saw my Abbot's garments over my head and imagined that he
   had drawn me out."

   PETER.

   These are wonderful things you report, and may be to the edification of
   many: for my own part, the more I drink of this good man's miracles,
   the more I thirst.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER VIII.

   Of the poisoned loaf which the crow carried away.

   When, as now, the places far and wide were very zealous in the love of
   our Lord God Jesus Christ, many abandoning the vanities of the world
   and putting themselves under the sweet yoke of our Redeemer; as it is
   the custom of the wicked to repine at the virtues of others, which
   themselves desire not to follow, one Florentius, the Priest of a Church
   hard by, and grandfather to Florentius our subdeacon, began by the
   instigation of the devil to be envious of the virtuous proceedings of
   the holy man, to derogate from his course of living hindering also as
   many as he could from resorting to him. But seeing that he could not
   stop his progress, the fame of his virtues still more increasing, and
   many upon the report of his sanctity reforming their lives daily, he
   became more and more envious, and constantly grew worse, for he desired
   himself the commendations of Benedict's life, but would not live
   commendably. Thus, blinded with envy, he sent to the servant of
   Almighty God a poisoned loaf for an offering, which the man of God
   received thankfully, although he was not ignorant of the poison in it.
   There used to come to him at the time of dinner a crow from the next
   forest, which took bread from his hand. Coming therefore, as she was
   wont, the man of God case before her the bread that the Priest had sent
   him, saying: "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ take this bread and
   cast it in some place where no man may find it." The crow, gaping and
   spreading her wings, run croaking about it, as though she would have
   said, I would willingly fulfil thy command, but I am not able. The man
   of God commanded again saying: "Take it up, take it up, and cast it
   where no man may find it." So at length the crow took it up in her beak
   and flew away with it and three hours after returned again to receive
   from his hand her ordinary allowance. But the venerable Father, seeing
   the Priest so perversely bent to seek his life, was more sorry for him
   than grieved for himself. When the aforesaid Florentius saw that he
   could not kill the body of his master, he attempted what he could
   against the souls of his disciples, in so much that he sent seven naked
   girls into the garden of the Cloister where Benedict lived, that so
   playing for a long time hand in hand, they might entice their souls to
   naughtiness, which when the holy man espied out of his cell, to prevent
   the fall of his younger disciples, and considering that all this was
   done only for the persecuting of himself, he gave place to envy, and
   after he had disposed of the Oratories and other buildings, leaving in
   them a competent number of Brethren with Superiors, he took with him a
   few monks and removed to another place. Thus the man of God with
   humility avoided his hatred, whom Almighty God struck with a terrible
   judgment: for when the aforesaid Priest, standing in his summer house,
   heard to his great joy, that Benedict was gone, the room wherein he was
   fell down and crushed and killed the enemy of Benedict, all the rest of
   the house remaining immovable. This Maurus, the disciple of the man of
   God, thought fit to signify forthwith to the venerable Father Benedict,
   who was yet scarce gone ten miles saying: "Return for the Priest that
   did persecute you is slain." Which the man of God hearing took very
   heavily, both because his enemy was dead and because his disciple
   rejoiced thereat. Whereupon he enjoined him a penance for presuming in
   a joyful manner to bring such news to him.

   PETER.

   These are wonderful strange things which thou sayest. For in the
   drawing water out of a rock methinks I behold in him Moses; in raising
   the iron from the bottom of the water he representeth Eliseus; in
   walking on the water Peter; in the obedience of the crow I conceive him
   another Elias; in bewailing his enemy's death I see David. In my
   opinion, this man was filled with the spirit of all the just.

   GREGORY.

   The man of God, Benedict, had in him, Peter, the spirit of God alone,
   which by the grace of free redemption replenished the hearts of all the
   elect, of which St. John saith: "There was true light which
   illuminateth every man that cometh into this world." Of which again it
   is written: "Of his plentitude and fulness we have all received." For
   the holy ones of God could indeed receive graces from God, but they
   could not impart them to others. He then gave signs of power to the
   lowly, who promised that He would shew the miracle of Jonas to His
   enemies, deigning in their sight to die, and in the sight of the humble
   to arise. So that the one should have what they would contemn, and the
   other what reverence and love. By which mystery it came to pass, that
   while the proud were spectators of His ignominious death, the humble
   contrariwise, against death, lay hold of the power of His glory.

   PETER.

   But declare, I pray, whither the holy man removed or if he wrought
   miracles in any other place?

   GREGORY.

   The holy man by removing changed his habitation, but not his adversary.
   For afterwards he endured so much the more grievous battles, by how
   much he had now the master of wickedness fighting openly against him.
   The castle called Cassino is situated upon the side of a high mountain,
   which containeth as it were, in the lap thereof, the same castle, and
   riseth into the air three miles high so that the top seemeth to touch
   the very heavens: on this stood an old temple where Apollo was
   worshipped by the foolish country people, according to the custom of
   the ancient heathens. Round about it, likewise, grew groves, in which
   even until that time, the mad multitude of infidels offered their
   idolatrous sacrifices. The man of God coming to that place brake down
   the idol, overthrew the altar, burnt the groves, and, of the temple of
   Apollo, made a chapel to St. Martin, and, where the profane altar had
   stood, he built a chapel of St. John; and, by continual preaching,
   converted many of the people thereabout. But the old enemy not bearing
   this silently, did present himself, not covertly or in a dream but
   openly and visibly in the sight of the Father, and with great cries
   complained of the violence he suffered, in so much that the brethren
   heard him though they could see nothing. For, as the venerable Father
   told his disciples, the wicked fiend represented himself to his sight
   all on fire, and, with flaming mouth and flashing eyes, seemed to rage
   against him. And, then, they all heard what he said, for, first, he
   called him by his name, and, when the man of God would make him no
   answer, he fell to reviling him. And whereas before he cried:
   "Benedict, Benedict," and saw he could get no answer, then he cried:
   "Maledict, not Benedict, what hast thou to do with me, and why dost
   thou persecute me?" But now we shall behold new assaults of the old
   enemy against the servant of God, against whom willingly did he make
   war, but against his will did he give him occasions of many victories.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER IX.

   How the man of God by his prayer, removed a huge stone.

   One day, as the brethren were building the cells of the Cloister, there
   lay a stone in the midst which they determined to lift up and put into
   the building. When two or three were not able to move it, they set more
   to it, but it remained as immoveable as if it had been held by roots to
   the ground, so that it was easy to conceive that the old enemy sat upon
   it, since that so many men were not able to lift it. After much labour
   in vain, they sent to the man of God to help them with his prayers to
   drive away the enemy, who presently came, and having first prayed, he
   gave his blessing, when behold the stone was as easily lifted as if it
   had not weight at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER X.

   Of the fantastical fire which burned the kitchen.

   Then the man of God thought good that they should dig in that place.
   When they had entered a good deepness, the Brethren found a brazen
   idol, which happening for the present to be cast in the kitchen,
   suddenly there seemed a flame to rise out of it, and, to the sight of
   all the Monks it appeared that all the kitchen was on fire. As they
   were casting on water to quench this fire, the man of God, hearing the
   tumult, came, and perceiving that there appeared fire in the eyes of
   the Brethren and not in his, he forthwith bowed his head in prayer, and
   calling upon those whom he saw deluded with an imaginary fire, he bade
   them sign their eyes that they might behold the kitchen entire, and not
   those fantastical flames which the enemy had counterfeited.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   How a boy crushed by the fall of a wall was healed by the servant of
   God.

   Again, when the Brethren were raising the wall a little higher for more
   convenience, the man of God was at his devotions in his cell, to whom
   the old enemy appeared in an insulting manner and told him he was going
   to his Brethren at work; the man of God straightway by a messenger
   advertized the Brethren thereof saying: "Brethren, have a care of
   yourselves, for the wicked spirit at this hour is coming to molest
   you." Scarce had the messenger told his errand when the malignant
   spirit overthrew the wall that was abuilding, and with the fall thereof
   crushed a young monk, son to a certain Senator. Hereat all of them much
   grieved and discomforted, not for the loss of the wall but for the harm
   to their brother, brought the heavy tidings to their venerable Father
   Benedict, who bid them bring the boy to him, who could not be carried
   but in a sheet, by reason that not only his body was bruised but also
   his bones crushed with the fall. Then the man of God willed them to lay
   him in his cell upon his mat where he used to pray; so causing the
   Brethren to go out he shut the door, and with more than ordinary
   devotion fell to his prayers. A wonder to hear, the very same hour he
   sent him to his work again, whole and sound as ever he was before, to
   help his Brethren in making up the wall; whereas the old enemy hoped to
   have had occasion to insult over Benedict for his death.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   Of Monks who had eaten out of their monastery.

   Now began the man of God, by the spirit of prophecy, to foretell things
   to come, and to certify those that were present with him of things that
   passed far off. It was the custom of the Monastery that the Brethren,
   sent abroad about any business, should neither eat nor drink anything
   outside their Cloister. This in the practice of the Rule being
   carefully observed, one day some Brethren upon occasion went abroad,
   and were forced to stay later than usual, so they rested and refreshed
   themselves in the house of a certain devout woman of their
   acquaintance. Returning late to the Monastery, they asked, as was the
   custom, the Abbot's blessing, of whom he straightway demanded, saying:
   "Where dined you?" they answered: "Nowhere." To whom he said: "Why do
   you lie? Did you not go into such a woman's house? Eat you not there
   such and such meats? Drank you not so many cups?" When the venerable
   Father had told them both the woman's lodging, the several sorts of
   meats, with the number of their draughts, they, in great terror fell
   down at his feet, and with acknowledgment of all that they had done
   confessed their fault. But he straightway pardoned them, persuading
   himself they would never afterwards attempt the like in his absence
   knowing he was always present with them in spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   How he reproved the brother of Valentinian the Monk for eating by the
   way.

   Moreover, the brother of Valentinian, the Monk, whom we mentioned in
   the beginning, was very devout although but a secular; and he used to
   go to the Monastery from his dwelling once every year and that fasting,
   that he might partake of the prayers of the servant of God, and see his
   brother. As he was on his way to the Monastery, another traveller, who
   carried meat with him, put himself into his company After they had
   travelled a good while, he said to him: "Come, Brother, let us refresh
   ourselves, lest we faint by the way." "God forbid!" answered the other,
   "by no means, Brother, for my custom is always to go to the venerable
   Father Benedict fasting." At which answer, his fellow-traveller, for
   the present, said no more; but, when they had gone a little further, he
   moved him again to ear, but he would not consent because he resolved to
   keep his fast. So the other was awhile silent, and went forward with
   him without taking any thing himself. After they had gone a great way,
   wearied with long travel, in their way they came to a meadow and a
   spring, with what else might delight them, there to take their repast.
   Then said his fellow-traveller: "So! Here is water, here is a meadow,
   here is a pleasant place for us to refresh and rest us awhile, that we
   may safely make an end of our journey." So, at the third motion, these
   words pleasing his ear and the place his eye, he was overcome,
   consented and ate. In the evening he came to the Monastery, where,
   conducted to the venerable Father Benedict, he craved his prayers, but
   soon the holy man reproved him for what he had done in the way, saying:
   "What was it, Brother, the malignant enemy suggested to thee by they
   fellow traveller? The first time he could not persuade nor yet the
   second, but the third time he prevailed and obtained his desire." Then
   the man acknowledging his fault fell at his feet, and began all the
   more to weep and to be ashamed, by reason that he perceived he had
   offended, although absent, in the sight of Father Benedict.

   PETER.

   I discover in the breast of the holy man the spirit of Eliseus, who was
   present with his disciple though far from him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   How he discovered the dissimulation of King Totila.

   GREGORY.

   You must, Peter, for a little while be silent, that you may know
   matters far more important. For, in the time of the Goths, their king,
   informed that the holy man had the gift of prophecy, went towards his
   Monastery and made some stay a little way off, and gave notice of his
   coming. To whom answer was made from the Monastery that he might come
   at his pleasure. The king, being of a treacherous nature, attempted to
   try whether the man of God had the spirit of prophecy. There was one of
   his guards called Riggo, upon whom he caused his own buskins to be put
   and so commanded him taking on him the king's person to go forward to
   the man of God, three of his chief pages attending upon him, to wit
   Vulderic, Ruderic and Blindin, to the end they should wait upon him in
   the presence of the servant of God, that so, by reason of his
   attendants and purple robes, he might be taken for the king. When the
   said Riggo, with his brave apparel and attendance, entered the cloister
   the man of God sat a little distance off, and seeing him come so nigh
   as he might hear him, he cried to him, saying: "Put off, son, put off
   that which thou carriest, for it is not thine." Riggo straightway fell
   to the ground and was much afraid, for having presumed to delude so
   holy a man; all his followers likewise fell down astonished, and
   rising, they durst not approach unto him, but returned to their king,
   and trembling related unto him how soon they were discovered.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   How he prophesied to king Totila and to the Bishop of Canosa.

   Then Totila came himself to the man of God, whom as soon as he saw
   sitting afar off, he durst not come nigh, but fell prostrate to the
   ground. The holy man twice of three bade him rise, but he durst not get
   up, then Benedict, the servant of Jesus Christ our Lord, deigned
   himself to come to the prostrate king, whom, raising from the ground,
   he rebuked for his deeds, and foretold in a few words all that should
   befall him saying: "Much evil dost thou do, and much wickedness hast
   thou done, as least now give over thy iniquity. Into Rome shalt thou
   enter, thou wilt cross over the sea, nine years shalt thou reign, and
   die the tenth." At the hearing whereof, the king sore appalled, craved
   his prayers and departed, but from that time he was less cruel. Not
   long after he went to Rome, sailed thence to Sicily, and in the tenth
   year of his reign, by the judgment of Almighty God, lost both crown and
   life.

   Moreover, the Bishop of the Church of Canosa used to come to the
   servant of God, who much loved him for his virtuous life. He,
   therefore, conferring with him concerning the coming of king Totila and
   the taking of the City of Rome, said: "The city doubtless will be
   destroyed by this king, so that it will never more be inhabited." To
   whom the man of God replied: "Rome shall never be destroyed by the
   Pagans, but shall be so shaken by tempests, lightnings and earthquakes
   that it will decay of itself." The mysteries of which prophecy we now
   behold as clear as day, for, in this city, we see the walls ruined,
   houses overturned, churches destroyed by tempestuous winds, and
   buildings rotten with old age, decay and falling into ruins. Although
   Honoratus, his disciple, from whose relation I had it, told me heard it
   not himself from his own mouth but was told it by the Brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   How venerable Benedict dispossessed a certain clerk from the Devil.

   At that time one of the clergy of the church of Aquin was molested with
   an evil spirit, whom the venerable man, Constantius, Bishop of that
   Diocese, had sent to divers martyrs' shrines to be cured; but the holy
   martyrs would not cure him, that the gifts of grace in Benedict might
   be made manifest. He was therefore brought to the servant of Almighty
   God, Benedict, who, by pouring forth prayers to our Lord Jesus Christ,
   presently drove out the enemy. Having cured him, he commanded him,
   saying: "Go! And hereafter never eat flesh, and presume not to take
   Holy Orders, for what time soever you shall presume to take Holy
   Orders, you shall again become a slave to the devil." The Clerk
   therefore went his way healed, and as present punishments make deep
   impressions, he carefully for a while observed the man of God's
   command. But when, after many years, all his seniors were dead and he
   saw his juniors preferred before him in Holy Orders, he neglected the
   words of the man of God, as though forgotten through length of time,
   and took upon him Holy Orders; whereupon, presently, the devil, who
   before had left him, took power of him, and never ceased to torment him
   till he severed his soul from his body.

   PETER.

   This holy man, I perceive, understood the secret decrees of God, in
   that he knew this Clerk to be delivered to the power of the devil, lest
   he should presume to receive Holy Orders.

   GREGORY.

   Why should not he know the secret decrees of Divine Providence, who
   kept the commandments of God, whence it is written that "he who
   adhereth to God is one spirit with Him."

   PETER.

   If he who adhereth to our Lord become one spirit with Him, how comes
   the same excellent Preacher to say: "Who hath known the mind of the
   Lord, or who has been His counsellor?" For it seems altogether unlikely
   that he, who is made one with another, should not know his mind.

   GREGORY.

   Holy men, so far as they are united with God, are not ignorant of His
   meaning, for the same Apostle saith; "For what man knoweth the things
   of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also,
   that are of God, no man knoweth but the spirit of God." And to shew
   that he knew things of God, he addeth: "But we have not received the
   spirit of this world, but the spirit which is of God." And again: "That
   eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it ascended into the
   heart of man, what things God hath prepared for those that love Him,
   but to us God hath revealed by His spirit."

   PETER.

   If then those things which appertained to God were revealed to the said
   Apostle by the spirit of God, what meaneth he to make this preamble,
   saying: "O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God;
   how incomprehensible are His judgments and His ways unsearchable." But
   as I am saying this, another question arises: for the Prophet David
   says to our Lord: "With my lips I have uttered all the judgments of Thy
   mouth." And, whereas, it is less to comprehend or know than to
   pronounce, what is the reason that St. Paul should affirm the judgments
   of God to be incomprehensible, while David professeth not only to know
   them but also to pronounce them with his lips?

   GREGORY.

   To both these difficulties -- I briefly answered before, when I said:
   that holy men, as far as they are one with God, are not ignorant of the
   mind of our Lord, for all such as do devoutly follow the Lord are also
   by devotion one with God; and yet, in that they are laden with the
   burden of this corruptible flesh, they are not with God. Therefore, for
   as much as they are united with God they know His secret judgments, of
   which likewise they are ignorant for as much as in respect separated
   from Him: and so they pronounce His judgments incomprehensible which
   they cannot as yet thoroughly understand. But they who in spirit adhere
   to Him, in this adhesion know His judgments, either by the sacred words
   of Scripture, or by hidden revelations, as far as they are capable;
   these therefore they know and declare, but they are ignorant of those
   which God concealeth. Whereupon the prophet David when he had said: "In
   my lips I will pronounce all Thy judgments," as if he had said plainly:
   "Those judgments I could both know and pronounce which Thou didst tell
   me, for those which Thou speakest not, without doubt Thou concealest
   from our knowledge. Thus, the saying of the Prophet agreeth with that
   of the Apostle, for the judgments of God are both incomprehensible, and
   yet those which proceed from His mouth are uttered with the lips of
   men, for being so manifested by God they may be conceived by men, nor
   can they be concealed.

   PETER.

   By occasion of the difficulty I propounded, I have obtained a clear
   solution. But if there remain aught concerning the virtue of this man,
   I pray you declare it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVII.

   How he prophecied the destruction of his Monastery.

   A certain nobleman, named Theoprobus, was by the admonition of Father
   Benedict converted, and for the merit of his life was very familiar and
   intimate with him. He one day entered into the cell of the man of God,
   found him weeping bitterly; when he had waited a good while and saw he
   did not give over, (though it was his custom in prayer mildly to weep
   and not to use any doleful lamentations) he boldly demanded of him the
   cause of so great grief. To whom the man of God presently replied: "All
   this Monastery which I have built, with whatsoever I have prepared for
   my Brethren, are, by the judgment of Almighty God, delivered over to
   the heathen: and I could scarce obtain to save the lives of those in
   this place. His words Theoprobus heard, but we see them verified in the
   destruction of his Monastery by the Longobards. For of late these
   Lombards, by night, when the Brethren were at rest, entered the
   Monastery and ransacked all, yet had not the power to lay hand on any
   man. But Almighty God fulfilled what he had promised to His faithful
   servant, Benedict, that although he gave their goods into the hands of
   the Paynims, yet he preserved their lives. In this Benedict did most
   clearly resemble St. Paul, whose ship with all its goods being lost,
   yet, for his comfort, he had the lives of all that were in his company
   bestowed upon him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   How St. Benedict discovered the hiding of a flagon of wine.

   Our monk Exhilaratus, whom you know well, on a time was sent by his
   master with two wooden vessels (which we call flagons) full of wine, to
   the man of God in his Monastery. He brought one but hid the other in
   the way, notwithstanding, the man of God, although he was not ignorant
   of anything done in his absence, received it thankfully, and advised
   the boy as he was returning back, in this manner: "Take care, son, thou
   drink not of that flagon which thou hast hid, but turn the mouth of it
   downward and then thou wilt perceive what is in it." He departed from
   the holy man much ashamed, and desirous to make further trial of what
   he had heard, held the flagon downwards, and presently there came forth
   a snake, at which the boy was sore affrighted and terrified for the
   evil he had committed.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   How the man of God reproved a Monk for receiving certain napkins.

   Not far distant from the monastery was a certain town in which no small
   number of people, by the exhortations of Benedict, were converted from
   the worship of idols to the faith of God. In that place were certain
   religious women, and the servant of God, Benedict, used to send often
   some of his Brethren thither to instruct and edify their souls. One
   day, as his custom was, he appointed one to go; but the Monk who was
   sent, after his exhortation, by the entreaty of the Nuns, took some
   small napkins and hid them in his bosom. As soon as he came back, the
   man of God began very sharply to rebuke him, saying: "How hath iniquity
   entered thy breast?" The Monk was amazed, and because he had forgotten
   what he had done, he wondered why he was so reprehended. To whom the
   holy Father said: "What! Was not I present when thou tookest the
   napkins of the handmaids of God and didst put them in thy bosom?"
   Whereupon he presently fell at his feet, and repenting of his folly
   threw away the napkins which he had hid in his bosom.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XX.

   How the man of God understood the proud thought of one of his Monks.

   One day as the venerable Father late in the evening was at his repast,
   it happened that one of his Monks, the son of a lawyer, held the candle
   to him; and whilst the man of God was eating, he standing in that
   manner, began by the suggestion of pride to say within himself, "Who is
   he whom I should wait upon at table, or hold the candle unto with such
   attendance? Who am I who should serve him?" To whom the man of God
   presently turning, checked him sharply saying: "Sign thy breast,
   Brother, what is this you say? Sign thy breast." Then he forthwith
   called upon the Brethren and willed them to take the candle out of his
   hand, and bade him for that time to leave his attendance and sit down
   quietly by him. The Monk being asked afterward of the Brethren
   concerning his thoughts at that time, told them how he was puffed up
   with a spirit of pride, and what he spake against the man of God
   secretly in his own heart. By this it was easily to be perceived that
   nothing could be kept from the knowledge of venerable Benedict, in
   whose ears the words of unspoken thoughts resounded.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   Of two hundred measures of meal found before the man of God's cell.

   At another time also in the country of Campania began a great famine,
   and all people suffered from great scarcity of food, so that all the
   wheat in Benedict's Monastery was spent, and likewise almost all the
   bread, so that but five loaves remained for the Brethren's refection.
   When the venerable Father perceived them sad, he endeavoured by a mild
   and gentle reproach to reprehend their pusillanimity, and with fair
   promises to comfort them, saying: "Why is your soul sad for want of
   bread? To day you are in want but to-morrow you shall have plenty." The
   next day there were found two hundred sacks of meal before the
   Monastery gates, by whom God Almighty sent it as yet no man knoweth.
   Which when the Monks beheld, they gave thanks to God, and by this were
   taught in their greatest want to hope for plenty.

   PETER.

   Tell me, I pray you, is it to be thought that this servant of God had
   continually the spirit of prophecy, when himself pleased, or only at
   certain times with some discontinuance.

   GREGORY.

   The spirit of prophecy, Peter, doth not always cast his beams upon the
   understanding of the Prophets, for as it is written of the Holy Ghost:
   "He breatheth where He will." So likewise must we conceive, also, when
   He pleaseth. And, therefore, Nathan being asked by the king if he might
   build the Temple, first allowed him to do it, and afterwards forbade
   him. This was the reason that Eliseus knew not the cause why the woman
   wept but said to his servant who did oppose her: "Let her alone for her
   soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath concealed it from me and hath not
   made it known." Thus Almighty God of His great mercy so disposeth in
   His providence, for the end that by giving the spirit of prophecy
   sometimes, and at other times withdrawing it, the minds of the Prophets
   be both elevated above themselves, and also be kept in humility, for by
   receiving the spirit they may know they are inspired by God, and again
   they receive it not, they may consider what they are of themselves.

   PETER.

   It standeth with good reason what you have said. But, I beseech you,
   prosecute what else you remember of the venerable Father Benedict.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   How by a vision, he gave order to construct

   The Monastery of Terracina.

   At another time, he was requested by a certain devout man to send some
   of his disciples to build a Monastery on his estate near the city of
   Terracina. To which request he consented, and sent some Monks,
   appointing an Abbot and Prior over them. As they were setting forward,
   he promised, saying: "Go, and upon such a day I will come and shew you
   where to build the Oratory, where the Refectory and lodging for the
   guests, or what else shall be necessary." So they received his blessing
   and departed, in hope to see him at the appointed day, for which they
   prepared all things they thought fit and necessary for their Father and
   his company. The night before the appointed day the man of God appeared
   in sleep to him whom he had constituted Abbot and to his Prior, and
   described to them most exactly how he would have the building ordered.
   When they awaked, they related to each other what they had seen, yet
   not altogether relying upon that vision, they expected the man of God
   according to his promise, but seeing he came not at his appointed time,
   they returned to him very pensive, saying: "We have expected, Father,
   your coming, as you promised, but you came not to shew us where and
   what we should build." To whom he said: "Why, Brethren, why do you say
   so? Did not I come according to my promise?" And when they said: "When
   came you?" he replied: "Did I not appear to each of you in your sleep
   and describe every place? Go, and according to the direction given you
   in that vision construct the Monastery." Hearing this they were much
   astonished, and so, returning to the manor, they erected the whole
   building according to the revelation.

   PETER.

   I would gladly be informed how and in what manner he could express his
   mind to them so far off, so they should both hear and understand by an
   apparition.

   GREGORY.

   What is the reason, Peter, thou dost so curiously search out the manner
   how it was done? It is evident that the spirit is of more mobile nature
   than the body. And we are taught by Scripture how the Prophet was taken
   up in Judea and set down, with the dinner he carried, in Chaldea, and,
   after he had refreshed another Prophet with his dinner, found himself
   again in Judea. If then Habacuc in a moment could corporally go so far
   and carry his dinner, what wonder if Father Benedict obtained to go in
   spirit and intimate to the spirits of his Brethren what was necessary;
   that as the other went corporally to convey corporal food, so he might
   go in spirit to inform them of things concerning a spiritual life?

   PETER.

   I confess that by this your discourse you have given full satisfaction
   to my doubtful mind; but I would gladly know what kind of man he was in
   his common conversation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   How certain Religious women were absolved

   After their death.

   GREGORY.

   Even his ordinary discourse, Peter, had a certain efficacious virtue,
   for his heart being elevated in contemplation, he would not allow a
   word to pass from his mouth in vain. If at any time he spake aught, yet
   not as one that determined what was best to be done, but by way of
   threatening, his words had the same force as if he had absolutely
   decreed it. For, not far from his Monastery, two Nuns of noble race and
   parentage lived in a place of their own: and a certain Religious man
   provided them with all things for their exterior. But as in some,
   nobility of birth causeth baseness in mind, so those, who bear in mind
   their own greatness do less humble themselves in this world. There
   aforesaid Nuns had not, as yet, refrained their tongues by a Religious
   habit, but, by their unadvised speeches, oftentimes provoked to anger
   the Religious man who had care over them. Wherefore, after he had for a
   long time endured their contumelious language, he complained to the man
   of God of the injuries he suffered. Which as soon as he heard he
   commanded them forthwith, saying: "Have a care of your tongues, for if
   you do not amend I excommunicate you." Which sentence of
   excommunication notwithstanding, he did not pronounce but threaten. Yet
   for all this, they nothing changed in their former conditions. Within a
   few days after they departed this life, and were buried in the Church.
   At such time as a Solemn Mass was sung, and the Deacon, as the custom
   is, cried aloud: "If there be any that communicateth not, let him go
   forth," then their nurse, who used to make offerings to our Lord for
   them, saw them rise out of their graves and go forth. This she often
   observed, that, when the Deacon cried in that manner, they went out,
   not able to remain in the Church, and, calling to mind what the man of
   God had said to them whilst they were living, (for he excluded them
   from communion unless they amended their language and manners) she,
   with great sorrow, informed the servant of God what she had seen. He
   presently with his own hands gave the offering saying: "Go and cause
   this oblation to be offered to our Lord, and they shall be no longer
   excommunicated." When therefore, this offering was made, and the
   Deacon, according to custom, cried out that such as did not communicate
   should go out of the Church, they were not seen to go forth any more.
   Whereby it was apparent that, whereas they went not forth with the
   excommunicated, they were admitted by our Lord to communion.

   PETER.

   It is marvellous strange that this man, although venerable and most
   holy, as yet living in the mortal body, should be able to release those
   who were standing at the invisible tribunal.

   GREGORY.

   And was not he, Peter, yet in this flesh who heard; "Whatsoever thou
   shalt bind upon earth shall be bound also in Heave, and whatsoever thou
   shalt loose on earth shall be loosed also in Heaven." Whose place and
   authority in binding and loosing they possess, who, by faith and
   virtuous life, obtain the dignity of holy government. And that man, an
   earthly creature, might receive this power, the Creator of Heaven and
   earth came down from Heaven to earth and that flesh might judge of
   spiritual things He became man for the redemption of mankind. For God
   thus condescending beneath Himself raised our weakness above itself.

   PETER.

   For the virtue of his miracles your words do yield a very good reason.

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   Of a boy who was cast out of his grave.

   GREGORY.

   Upon a certain day, a young Monk of his, who was over-much affected
   towards his parents, went from the Monastery to their abode without his
   benediction, and the very same day, as soon as he was come to them he
   died. The day following his burial they found his body cast up, which
   they interred the second time, and the next day after it was found in
   like manner lying above ground as before. Hereupon they ran straight
   way and fell at the feet of the most mild Father Benedict imploring his
   aid, to whom the man of God with his own hand gave the communion of the
   Lord's Body saying: "Go, and lay the Body of the Lord upon his breast
   and so bury him." This done, the earth kept his body, and never after
   cast it up. You perceive, Peter, of what merit this man was with our
   Lord Jesus Christ, seeing that the very earth cast forth the body of
   him who had not received the blessing of Benedict.

   PETER.

   I do plainly perceive it, and am much astonished thereat.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

   Of the Monk, who leaving his Monastery

   met a dragon in the way.

   One of his Monks of a wandering and inconstant disposition, would by no
   means abide in the Monastery. Although the man of God had often
   reproved and admonished him of it, he would in no wise consent to
   remain in the congregation, and often entreated earnestly to be
   released. So the venerable Father, overcome with his importunity in
   anger bade him begone. Scarce was he got out of the Monastery, when he
   met in the way a dragon who, with open mouth made towards him. Seeing
   it ready to devour him, he began to quake and tremble, crying out
   aloud: "Help, help, for this dragon will devour me." The Brethren upon
   this ran out, yet saw no dragon, but took the panting and afrightened
   Monk back again to the Monastery, who forthwith promised never to
   depart and from that time he remained always constant in his promise.
   He, by the prayers of the holy man, was made to see the dragon ready to
   devour him, which before he had followed unperceived.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

   Of the boy cured of the Leprosy.

   But I must not pass over in silence what I heard of a very honourable
   man named Anthony, who affirmed that a servant of his father fell into
   a leprosy, insomuch that his hair fell off, and his skin was swollen so
   that he could no longer hide the increase of his disease. Who being
   sent by the gentleman's father to the man of God, he was by him quickly
   restored to his former health.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

   How St. Benedict miraculously procured money

   for a poor man to discharge his debt.

   Nor will I conceal that which his disciple Peregrine was wont to
   relate: how, on a certain day, an honest man, constrained by the
   necessity of a debt, thought his only remedy was to have recourse to
   the man of God, and acquaint him with his necessity. So he came to the
   Monastery, where finding the servant of Almighty God, told him how he
   was extremely urged by his creditor for the payment of twelve
   shillings. The venerable father answered him that, in very deed, he had
   not twelve shillings, but yet he comforted his want with good words,
   saying: "Go, and after two days return hither again for today I have it
   not to give thee." These two days, as his custom was, he spent in
   prayer, and, on the third day, when the poor debtor came again,
   thirteen shillings were found upon a chest of the Monastery that was
   full of corn. These the man of God caused to be brought to him, and
   gave them to the distressed man, saying that he might pay twelve, and
   have one to defray his charges.

   But to return to those things which I learned of his disciples of whom
   I spoke in the beginning of this book, there was a certain man had an
   adversary who bore him deadly hatred, and so great was his malice that
   he gave him poison in his drink; which potion, although it procured not
   his death, yet so altered his colour that his body became all speckled
   like a leper. This man was brought to the man of God and was quickly
   restored to his former health; for as soon as he touched him, the
   diversity of colours vanished from his skin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

   How a bottle was cast down upon the

   Stones and not broken.

   At such time as the great famine was in Campania, the man of God gave
   all he had in his Monastery to those in want, insomuch as there was
   almost nothing left in the cellar save only a little oil in a glass
   vessel. When one Agapitus, a Subdeacon, came earnestly entreating to
   have a little oil given him, the man of God (who had resolved to give
   all upon earth that he might have all in Heaven) commanded this little
   oil that was left to be given him. The Monk, who was Cellarer, heard
   his command but was loath to fulfill it. And the holy man a little
   while after demanded whether he had done what he willed him, and the
   Monk answered that he had not given it, because if he had given it,
   there would be nothing left for the Brothers. Hereat, much displeased,
   the good father bade some other take the glass bottle in which there
   remained a little oil, and cast it out of the window, to the end that
   nothing of the fruits of disobedience might remain in the Monastery.
   This was accordingly done; under the window was a steep fall, full of
   huge rough stones, upon which the glass fell, yet it remained as whole
   and entire as if it had not been thrown down, so that neither was the
   glass broke nor the oil spilt. Then the man of God commanded it to be
   taken up and given to him that asked it. Then calling the Brothers
   together, he rebuked the disobedient Monk before them all for his pride
   and unfaithfulness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIX.

   How an empty barrel was filled with oil.

   Having ended the Chapter, he and all the Brethren fell to their
   prayers. In the place where they prayed was an empty oil-barrel close
   covered. As the holy man continued his prayer, the cover of the said
   tun began to be heaved up by the oil increasing under it, which ran
   over the brim of the vessel upon the floor in great abundance. Which so
   soon as the servant of God, Benedict, beheld, he forthwith ended his
   prayer, and the oil ceased to run over. Then he admonished the
   distrustful and disobedient brother to have confidence and learn
   humility. So the brother thus reprehended was much ashamed, because the
   venerable Father had by his admonition and by his miracle shewn the
   power of Almighty God, nor could anyone afterwards doubt of what he
   promised, since, as it were in a moment, for a glass bottle almost
   empty, he had restored a tun full of oil.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXX.

   How he delivered a Monk from the devil.

   One day as he was going to St. John's Oratory, which stands upon the
   very top of the mountain, he met the old enemy upon a mule, in the
   habit and comportment of a physician, carrying a horn and a mortar;
   who, being demanded whither he went, answered he was going to the monks
   to minister a potion. So the venerable Father Benedict went forward to
   the chapel to pray, and, having finished, returned back in great haste,
   for the wicked spirit found one of the ancient Monks drawing water, and
   presently he entered into him, threw him on to the ground and tortured
   him pitifully. As soon as the man of God, returning from prayer, found
   him thus cruelly tormented, he only gave him a blow on the cheek with
   his hand, and immediately drave the wicked spirit out of him, so that
   he durst never after return.

   PETER.

   I would know whether he obtained these great miracles always by prayer,
   or did them some times only by the intimation of his will?

   GREGORY.

   They who are perfectly united with God, when necessity requireth, work
   miracles both ways, sometimes they do wonders by prayer, sometimes by
   power. For since St. John saith: "As many as received Him, to them He
   gave power to become sons of God." What wonder is it if they have the
   privilege and power to work miracles who are exalted to the dignity of
   children of God. And that they work miracles in both ways is manifest
   in St. Peter, who by prayer, raised Tabitha from death, and punished
   with death Ananias and Sapphira for their falsehood. For we do not read
   that he prayed when they fell down dead, but only that he rebuked them
   for their fault committed. It is evident therefore that these things
   are done sometimes by power, sometimes by petition: since that by
   reproof he deprived these of their life, and by prayer revived the
   other.

   But now I will produce two other acts of the faithful servant of God,
   Benedict, in which it shall clearly appear that some things he could do
   by power received from Heaven, and others by prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXI.

   How a country man was loosed by only the

   sight of the man of God.

   A certain Goth named Galla was of the impious sect of the Arians, and
   he, in the time of their king Totila did, with such monstrous cruelty,
   persecute religious men of the Catholic Church, insomuch that if any
   cleric or monk came in his sight, he was sure not to escape from his
   hands alive. This man enraged with an insatiable covetousness of spoil
   and pillage, lighted one day upon a husbandman whom he tortured with
   cruel torments. The rustic, overcome with pain, professed that he had
   committed his goods to the custody of the servant of God, Benedict.
   This he feigned that he might free himself from torments and prolong
   his life for some time. Then this Galla gave over tormenting him, and
   tying his arms together with a strong cord, made him run before his
   horse to shew him who this Benedict was, that had received his goods.
   Thus the man went in front, having his arms bound, and brought him to
   the holy man's Monastery, whom he found sitting alone at the Monastery
   gate reading. Then the countryman said to Galla, who followed furiously
   after him: "See! This is Father Benedict whom I told you of." The
   barbarous ruffian, looking upon him with enraged fury, thought to
   affright him with his usual threats, and began to cry out with a loud
   voice, saying: "Rise, rise and deliver up this rustic's goods which
   thou hast received." At whose voice the man of God suddenly lifted up
   his eyes from reading, and saw him and also the countryman whom he kept
   bound: thus, as he cast his eyes upon his arms, in a wonderful manner
   the cords began to fall off so quickly, that no man could possibly have
   so soon untied them.

   When Galla perceived the man whom he brought bound, so suddenly
   loosened and at liberty, struck into fear at the sight of so great
   power, he fell prostrate, and bowing his stiff and cruel neck at the
   holy man's feet, begged his prayers. But the holy man rose not from his
   reading but called upon the Brethren to bring him to receive his
   benediction. When he was brought to him, he exhorted him to leave his
   barbarous and inhuman cruelty. So, vanquished, he departed, never after
   presuming to ask anything of the countryman, whom the man of God
   unloosed not by touching but by casting his eye upon. Thus you see,
   Peter, as I said, that those who are the true servants of Almighty God,
   sometimes do work miracles by a commanding power, for he who sitting
   still abated the fury of that terrible Goth and with his only look
   unloosed the cords wherewith the innocent man's arms were fast
   pinioned, sheweth, evidently, by the swiftness of the miracle, that he
   wrought it by a power received. Now I will also shew you how great and
   strange a miracle he obtained by prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXII.

   How he raised a child from the dead.

   As he was one day in the field labouring with his Brethren, a certain
   peasant came to the Monastery, carrying in his arms the dead body of
   his son, and pitifully lamenting his loss, asked for the holy Father
   Benedict. When they said that he was in the field, he presently laid
   down the dead body of his son at the Monastery gate, and, as one
   distracted with grief, began running to find out the venerable father.
   At the same time the man of God was coming home with his Brethren from
   labouring in the field, whom, when the distressed countryman espied, he
   began to cry out: "Restore me my son, restore me my son." But the man
   of God amazed at this voice said: "What! have I taken your son from
   you?" To whom the man replied: "He is dead, come and raise him." When
   the servant of God heard this he was much grieved, and said: "Go,
   Brethren, go! This is not a work for us, but such as were the holy
   Apostles. Why will you impose burdens upon us which we cannot bear?"
   Notwithstanding, the man enforced with excessive grief, persisted in
   his petition, swearing that he would not depart unless he raised his
   son to life. Then the servant of God enquired, saying: "Where is he?"
   He answered: "Lo! his body lieth at the Monastery Gate." Whither, when
   the man of God with his Brethren was come, he knelt down and laid
   himself on the body of the child; then, raising himself and with his
   hands held up towards Heaven, he prayed: "O Lord, regard not my sins,
   but the faith of this man who craveth to have his son restored to life,
   and restore again to this body the soul which thou hast taken from it."
   Scarce had he finished these words, but all the body of the boy began
   to tremble at the re-entry of the soul, so that in the sight of all who
   were present he was seen with wonderful quaking to pant and breathe.
   Whom he presently took by the hand and delivered alive and sound to his
   father.

   It seemeth to me, Peter, he had not this miracle actually in his power,
   which he prostrated himself to obtain by prayer.

   PETER.

   What you have said is undoubtedly true, because you prove by deeds what
   was said in words. But I pray, certify me, whether holy men can effect
   and obtain whatsoever they will or desire?
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIII.

   Of the miracle wrought by his sister Scholastica.

   GREGORY.

   Who was ever, Peter, in this life more sublime than St. Paul, who,
   notwithstanding, three times craved of our Lord to be free from the
   pricks of the flesh, yet could not obtain it? To this purpose, I must
   tell you a passage concerning the venerable Father Benedict, that there
   was something he desired and was not able to accomplish.

   His sister Scholastica, who was consecrated to God from her very
   childhood, used to come once a year to see him; unto whom the man of
   God was wont to go to a house not far from the gate, within the
   possession of the Monastery. Thither she came one day according to her
   custom, and her venerable brother likewise with his disciples: where,
   after they had spent the whole day in the praise of God and pious
   discourses, the night drawing on, they took their refection together.
   As they were yet sitting at table, and protracting the time with holy
   conference, the religious woman, his sister, entreated him saying: "I
   beseech you, leave me not this night, that we may talk until morning of
   the joys of the heavenly life." To whom he answered: "What is this you
   say, sister? By no means can I stay out of my Monastery." At this time
   the sky was serene, and not a cloud was to be seen in the air. The holy
   woman, therefore, hearing her brother's refusal, clasped her hands
   together upon the table, and bowing her head upon them she prayed to
   Almighty God. As she raised up her head from the table, there began
   such vehement lightning and thunder, with such abundance of rain, that
   neither venerable Benedict nor his Brethren were able to put foot out
   of doors. For the holy woman when she leaned her head upon her hands,
   poured forth a flood of tears upon the table by which she changed the
   fair weather into foul and rainy. For, immediately after her prayers,
   followed the inundation, and the two did so concur that, as she lifted
   up her head, the crack of thunder was heard, so that in one and the
   same instant she lifted up her head and brought down the rain. Then the
   man of God perceiving that, by reason of thunder and lightening with
   continual showers of rain, he could not possibly return to his
   monastery, was sad and began to complain, saying: "God Almighty forgive
   you, sister, what is this you have done?" To whom she made answer: "I
   prayed you to stay and you would not hear me; I prayed to Almighty God
   and He heard me! Now, therefore, if you can, go forth to the Monastery
   and leave me." But he not able to go forth, was forced to stay against
   his will.

   Thus it fell out that they spent the night in watching, and received
   full content in spiritual discourse of heavenly matters. By this it
   appears, as I said before, that he desired something which he could not
   obtain; for if we consider the mind of the venerable man, he would,
   without doubt, have had the fair weather to continue in which he set
   out. But, contrary to what he willed, he found a miracle worked by the
   courage of a woman in the strength of Almighty God. And no wonder if at
   that time a woman were more powerful than he, considering she had long
   desired to see her brother. For according to the saying of St. John:
   "God is charity," and with good reason she was more powerful who loved
   more.

   PETER.

   I confess that I am wonderfully pleased with that which you tell me.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIV.

   In what manner St. Benedict saw the soul

   Of his sister go forth from her body.

   GREGORY.

   The next day, the venerable woman returned to her Cloister and the man
   of God to his Monastery. When, behold, three days after, while standing
   in his cell, he saw the soul of his sister depart out of her body, and,
   in the form of a dove, ascend and enter into the celestial mansions.
   Who rejoicing much to see her great glory, gave thanks to God Almighty
   in hymns and praises, and announced her death to the Brethren. Whom he
   forthwith sent to bring her body to the Monastery, and caused it to be
   buried in the same tomb that he had prepared for himself. By means of
   which it fell out, that as their minds were always one in God, so also
   their bodies were not separated in their burial.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXV.

   How the whole world was repesented before his

   Eyes: and the soul of Germanus, Bishop of Capua.

   Another time, Servandus, Deacon and Abbot of that Monastery which was
   built by Liberius, sometime a senator, in the Campania, used often to
   visit him, for being also illuminated with grace and heavenly doctrine,
   he repaired divers times to the Monastery that they might mutually
   communicate one to another, and, at least with sighs and longing
   desires, taste of that sweet food of the celestial country whose
   perfect fruition they were not as yet permitted to enjoy. When it was
   time to go to rest, venerable Benedict went up to the top of the tower
   in the lower part of which Servandus the Deacon had his lodging, and
   from which there was an open passage to ascend to the higher. Over
   against the said tower was a large building in which the disciples of
   both reposed. While as yet the Monks were at rest, the man of God,
   Benedict, being diligent in watching, rose up before the night office
   and stood at the window making his prayer to Almighty God about
   midnight, when suddenly, looking forth, he saw a light glancing from
   above, so bright and resplendent that it not only dispersed the
   darkness of the night, but shined more clear than the day itself. Upon
   this sight a marvellous strange thing followed, for, as he afterwards
   related, the whole world, compacted as it were together, was
   represented to his eyes in one ray of light. As the venerable Father
   had his eyes fixed upon this glorious lustre, he beheld the soul of
   Germanus, Bishop of Capua, carried by angels to Heaven in a fiery
   globe. Then, for the testimony of so great a miracle, with a loud voice
   he called upon Servandus the Deacon, twice or thrice by his name, who,
   troubled at such an unusual crying out of the man of God, came up,
   looked forth, and saw a little stream of light then disappearing, and
   wondered greatly at this miracle. Whereupon the man of God told him in
   order all that he had seen, and sent presently to Theoprobus, a
   Religious man in the town of Cassino, ordering him to go the same night
   to Capua, and learn what had happened to Germanus the Bishop. It fell
   out so, that he who was sent found the most reverend Bishop Germanus
   dead, and on enquiring more exactly, he learned that his departure was
   the very same moment in which the man of God had seen him ascend.

   PETER.

   A wonderful thing and much to be admired, but, whereas you said that
   the whole world, as it were, under one sunbeam, was represented to his
   sight, as I never experienced the like, so I cannot imagine how or in
   what manner this was possible that the whole world should be seen of
   any one man.

   GREGORY.

   Assure yourself, Peter, of that which I speak: that in a soul that
   beholdeth the Creator, all creatures appear but narrow; for, should we
   partake never so little of the light of the Creator, whatsoever is
   created would seem very little; because the soul is enlarged by this
   Beatific vision, and so dilated in the Divine perfections, that it far
   transcends the world and itself also. The soul thus rapt in the light
   of God is in her interior lifted up, and enabled above itself, and
   while thus elevated it contemplates itself, and it easily comprehendeth
   how little that is which before it was not able to conceive. So the
   blessed man who saw the globe of fire with the Angels returning to
   Heaven could not possibly have beheld those things but only in the
   light of God. What wonder then if he saw the world at one view who was
   in mind exalted above the world? But whereas I said that the whole
   world compacted as it were together was represented before his eyes, it
   is not meant that heaven and earth were straitened by contraction, but
   that the mind of the beholder was dilated, which, rapt in the sight of
   God might, without difficulty, see all that is under God. Therefore, in
   that light which appeared to his outward eyes, the inward light which
   was in his soul ravished the mind of the beholder with higher things,
   and shewed how mean are all inferior things.

   PETER.

   I perceive that it was to my profit that I understood you not before,
   for my slowness has been the occasion of so long and profitable a
   discourse. But, since you have clearly explained these things to me, I
   beseech you continue your former narration.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVI.

   How he wrote a Rule for Monks.

   I would willingly, Peter, relate many things concerning this venerable
   Father, but some of purpose I omit, because I hasten to speak of the
   acts of others. Only this I would not have you to be ignorant of, that
   the man of God, among so many miracles wherewith he shined to the
   world, was also eminent for his doctrine, for he wrote a Rule for Monks
   both excellent for discretion and eloquent in style. Of whose life and
   conversation if any wish to know further, he may in the institution of
   that Rule understand all his manner of life and discipline, for the
   holy man could not possibly teach otherwise than he lived.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVII.

   How he prophetically foretold his death

   To his Brethren.

   The same year in which he departed out of this life, he foretold the
   day of his most holy death to some of his disciples who conversed with
   him, and to others who were far off; giving strict charge to those who
   were present to keep in silence what they had heard, and declaring to
   the absent by what sign they should know when his soul departed out of
   his body. Six days before his departure he caused his grave to be
   opened, and immediately after he fell into a fever, by the violence
   whereof his strength began to wax faint, and the infirmity daily
   increasing, the sixth day he caused his disciples to carry him into the
   Oratory, where he did arm himself for his going forth by receiving the
   Body and Blood of the Lord; then, supporting his weak limbs by the
   hands of his disciples, he stood up, his hands lifted towards Heaven,
   and with words of prayer at last breathed forth his soul. The same day
   two of his Brethren, the one living in the Monastery and the other in a
   place far remote, had a revelation in one and the self-same manner. For
   they beheld a way, spread with garments and shining with innumerable
   lamps, stretching directly eastwards from his cell up to Heaven; a man
   of venerable aspect stood above and asked them whose way that was. But
   they professing they knew not, he said to them: "This is the way by
   which the beloved of the Lord, Benedict, ascended." Thus the disciples
   who were present knew of the death of the holy man, and so also those
   who were absent understood it by the sign foretold them. He was buried
   in the Oratory of St. John the Baptist which he himself had built upon
   the ruins of Apollo's altar.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVIII.

   How a mad woman was cured in his cave.

   In the cave also in which he formerly lived in Subiaco, even to this
   day, miracles are wrought upon such as repair thither with true faith.
   For very lately happened that which I now relate. A certain woman
   bereft of reason, and altogether distracted in her senses, roamed over
   mountains and valleys, through woods and fields by day and night, never
   resting, except when forced from weariness to lie down. One day, as she
   raged thus madly up and down, she lighted upon the cave of blessed
   Benedict, and by chance entered and remained there. The next morning
   she came out as sound and perfect in her senses as if she had never
   been out of them, and from that time remained all her life in the
   health which she had there recovered.

   PETER.

   What should be the reason that we experience, even in the patronage of
   martyrs, that they do not bestow so great favours by their bodies as by
   their relics: yea, and do greater miracles where themselves be not?

   GREGORY.

   Where the bodies of holy martyrs lie, no doubt, Peter, but there they
   are able to shew many miracles, as they do; for to such as have
   recourse unto them, with pure mind, they shew many marvellous favours.
   But forasmuch as weak souls might doubt whether they be present to hear
   them or no in those places where their bodies be not, it is necessary
   to shew more miracles where weak souls may doubt of their presence. For
   they whose minds are fixed in God have so much the greater merit of
   faith, that though their bodies lie not there, yet they be there
   present to hear our prayers. Wherefore Truth Itself to increase the
   faith of His disciples said: "If I go not away the Paraclete will not
   come unto you." For whereas it is certain, that the Holy Ghost, the
   Comforter, always proceedeth from the Father and the Son: why doth the
   Son say that He will go from them that the Paraclete may come, who
   never departeth from the Son? But because the Disciples beholding our
   Lord in the flesh, did desire always to behold Him with their corporeal
   eyes, it was rightly said unto them: "Unless I go away the Paraclete
   will not come." As if He had said plainly: If I withdraw not My bodily
   presence, I do not shew you the love of the Spirit: and, unless you
   cease to see Me carnally, you will never learn to love spiritually.

   PETER.

   What you say pleaseth me.

   GREGORY.

   Let us now for a while cease our discourse, that by silence we may be
   the better enabled to prosecute the miracles of other saints.

                                   CHRONOLOGY

  OF THE

                        LIFE OF THE MOST HOLY PATRIARCH

                                 SAINT BENEDICT

   (from Haften's Disgnis. Monast.)

   "His memory shall not depart away; and his Name shall be in request
   from generation to generation." (Ecclus. 39)

   (The figures in parenthesis denote the age of St. Benedict.)

   YEAR.

   480. (--) St. Benedict and his twin-sister St. Scholastica are born in
   Nursia, a town in the south of Italy: their Father, Anicius Eupropius:
   their Mother, Abundantia.

   487. (7.) St; Benedict is sent to Rome to study, his nurse Cyrilla
   accompanies him.

   493. (13.) God, calling him to higher things, and the dangers of the
   world prompting him to leave it, he quits Rome to seek salvation and
   perfection in solitude. On their way in a little village, 30 miles from
   Rome, he works a miracle to console Cyrilla.

   494. (14.) He leaves Cyrilla and goes alone to Subiaco, a mountainous
   district, 40 miles distant from Rome: meets a holy Hermit named
   Romanus, from whom he asks and receives the Religious Habit: then going
   into a little Cave amidst the rocks, dwells there in union with his God
   in prayer, unknown to all, excepting St. Romanus who brought him food.

   497. (17.) On the Easter Sunday of this year, a Priest receives a
   command from God to visit this Cave, and honour the youthful hermit.

   Some neighbouring Shepherds discover the Saint.

   He gains the noble victory over the spirit of impurity and placing the
   lily of his Chastity amidst thorns and nettles, he secures it against
   every temptation for the remainder of his life.

   509. (29.) His sanctity becoming noised abroad many men leave the
   world, and put themselves under his spiritual guidance.

   510. (30.) After frequent refusals he, at last, yields to the request
   of the Monks of Vico-Varro, who besought him to become their Abbot. As
   he had foretold them they grew angry at his corrections: they seek to
   poison him: he returns to his dear solitude of Subiaco.

   St. Maurus is born.

   511. (31.) During the next 19 years St. Benedict builds 12 monasteries
   on the Subiaco mountains.

   515. (35.) St Placid is born.

   522. (42.) Sts. Maurus and Placid are brought to Subiaco by their
   Parents, and receive from St. Benedict the Monastic Habit.

   523. (43.) St. Maurus in obedience to St. Benedict walks on the waters
   of the lake, into which St. Placid had fallen, and saves him from being
   drowned.

   529. (49.) St. Benedict leaves Subiaco, and goes to Mount Cassino
   (about 50 miles south of Subiaco).

   530. (50.) He begins to build the Monastery of Mount Cassino.

   536. (56.) He sends St. Placid into Sicily.

   St. Benedict has the mysterious vision, in which God grants him the
   sight of the whole world, brought together in one ray of the sun.

   537. (57.) St. Placid begins the Monastery at Messina in Sicily: he
   finishes it in 4 years.

   539. (59.) During a famine St. Benedict distributes to the poor all the
   corn of the Monastery: on the following day he receives from Heaven, in
   return, 200 bushels of flour.

   In hatred of Disobedience and out of love for Charity he works the
   miracle of the glass oil-jar.

   Whilst he is at prayer with some of his Brethren, an empty vessel which
   was in the room is miraculously filled with oil, even to over-flowing.

   541. (61.) St. Placid is martyred (probably in this year).

   543. (63.) King Totila the Barbarian visits St. Benedict: receives his
   paternal reproach and prophecy.

   On the 10^th of January, St. Benedict sends St. Maurus into France.

   On the 6^th of February he has the last conference with his sister St.
   Scholastica.

   On the 10^th of February, he sees the soul of his Sister, St.
   Scholastica, ascending to heaven under the form of a Dove.

   On the 16^th of March, knowing that the hour of his Death is near he
   orders his grave to be opened.

   On the 21^st of March at 3 o'clock in the morning, standing in the
   chapel of his Monastery of Mount Cassino, supported by his Religious,
   he dies, in the 63^rd year of his age.

    OF OUR

  MOST HOLY FATHER SAINT BENEDICT.

Pax multa diligentibus legem tuam.

   Mark a monk,

   Disciple of the Holy Father Benedict.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

   While the blind crowd at idol shrines profane devotions paid,

   Believing that by mortal hands immortal gods were made,

   This fane with altars ruinous by them was whilom built,

   Who offered to the impure Jove a sacrifice of guilt;

   But holy Benedict, by God called from the desert lone,

   Made pure this port, the statues broke, threw down the sculptur'd
   stone.

   A temple for the living God this idol fane is now:

   Let not the faithful soul delay to pay his pious vow;

   But hither haste, spite of rough ways; his recompense shall be

   That he the heavens opened wide with eye of faith may see.

   With hard and toilsome labour'tis that great things are attained:

   Within the narrow path alone the blessed life is gained.

   While hither coming penitent bow'd down with load of sin,

   I felt its weight was gone from me, I felt at peace within;

   And I believe in bliss above I too shall have my share,

   If thou for Marcus, Benedict, wilt breathe an earnest prayer.

   The foolish people once had called this place a citadel

   And dedicated, for their gods of marble there to dwell;

   But had they wished to find true words with which to stamp the same,

   Tartarean Chaos blank, confused, had been its rightful name.

   Hither they wandered, blinded fools, unceasing vows to pay

   To the death-dealing thundering Jove, acknowledging his sway.

   The hall's high summit, I suppose, he once had struck in vain,

   Giving the name of citadel to this now sacred fane.

   Against it now shall not prevail gates of eternal Hell:

   That which the stronghold was of Death is now Life's citadel.

   From here is stormed the golden gate of the bright starry heaven

   While the bless'd crowd sing angel strains to angel voices given.

   From here, O Hermit thou dost speak to God the Thunderer true

   On mountain heights leading thy quire, the faithful chosen few.

   When from a mountain far away to this mount thou didst come

   Christ wast thy guide, thy path, whilst thou the desert drear didst
   roam.

   He angels sent to keep thy feet at every cross-way

   Lest from the rightful destin'd path thy faltering steps should stray.

   He had foretold to thee, just man, alone in desert land,

   Avoid these spots, another friend to guide thee is at hand.

   Now thou art taken home to him, the mountain's lurid dye

   Takes colour from the lowering clouds which hide its top from view.

   The caves drip down with copious tears, the barren grottoes mourn,

   The beasts their denizens lament--thou hast left all forlorn.

   Thee too the lakes and brooks have wept with deep and unfeign'd grief.

   The wood unkempt hath shed for thee each rent and withered leaf.

   Fables I speak not when I tell that, following thee anear,

   To bear thee faithful company three ravens did appear.

   The peoples seek thee out, where thou hast found thy place of rest,

   Where thou await'st the holy night, eve of the pious feast.

   Like orphans destitute they mourn with hoarse and bitter plaint

   Bereft of thy sweet fellowship, thou gentle, perfect Saint.

   When thou wert hither brought, behold! the rocks and thorns divide,

   And wonder-working fountains spring from the earth's parched side.

   Surely the mount of Christ, is Lord o'er all the mountains round;

   And yet beneath thy feet it placed its top--twice-hallow'd ground.

   For thee with head submiss it makes all its rough places plain

   That thou, O holy Saint of Christ, should'st herald forth His reign.

   That they who seek thee, Benedict, should not grow faint and tire,

   Its gentle slope spreads out for those who upward do aspire.

   Tis meet that unto thee the mount itself this honour bring,

   Since with thy healing presence thou dost winter turn to spring.

   Thou dost lay out its places dry with gardens fair to view;

   Thou coverest its sterile rocks with flowers of every hue.

   The crags amazed bring forth their crops and harvests not their own,

   The greenwood trees bend down with fruits where once was arid stone.

   Thus thou dost water hearts of men with healthful streams of prayer

   Bidding their vain and barren acts the fruit of grace to bear.

   So now, I pray thee, turn the thorns which rend thy Marcus' breast

   To fruits unfading of good works, earnest of endless rest.

THE PROLOGUE

    OF OUR

                        MOST HOLY FATHER SAINT BENEDICT

  TO HIS RULE

   Hearken, my son, to the precepts of thy Master, and incline the ear of
   thy heart willingly to hear, and effectually to accomplish, the
   admonition of thy living Father, that by the labour of obedience thou
   mayest return to Him, from Whom thou didst depart by the sloth of
   disobedience. To thee therefore is my speech now directed, who,
   renouncing thy own will, dost take upon thee the strong and bright
   armour of obedience, to fight under the Lord Christ our true King.

   First of all whatever good work thou dost begin, beg of Him with most
   earnest prayer to perfect; that He Who hath now vouchsafed to reckon us
   in the number of His children, may not be saddened by our evil deeds.
   For we must at all times so serve Him with the goods He hath bestowed
   upon us, that He may not either as an angry Father disinherit us His
   children, or as a dread Lord, exasperated by our offences, deliver us
   up to perpetual punishment as wicked servants, who would not follow Him
   to glory.

   Let us therefore arise, the Scripture stirring us up and saying, "It is
   now the hour for us to rise from sleep", [1] and our eyes being opened
   to the deifying light, let us with wondering ears attend to the
   admonition with the Divine Voice daily addresseth to us, saying:
   "To-day if you shall hear His voice, harden not your hearts". [2] And
   again: "He that hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the
   Churches." [3] And what saith He? "Come, ye children, and hearken unto
   Me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord." [4] "Run while ye have the
   light of life, that the darkness of death overtake ye not." [5]

   And our Lord seeking His labourer among the multitude to whom He here
   speaketh, saith again: "Who is the man that will have life, and
   desireth to see good days?" [6] If thou, hearing this, dost answer: "I
   am he": God saith unto thee: "If thou wilt have true and everlasting
   life, refrain thy tongue from evil, and thy lips, that they speak no
   guile. Decline from evil, and do good; seek after peace and pursue it."
   [7] And when you have done this: My eyes shall be upon you, and My ears
   shall be open to your prayers. And before you can call upon Me, I will
   say: "Behold I am present." [8] What, dearest brethren, can be sweeter,
   than this voice of the Lord, inviting us? Behold how in His loving
   Kindness He showeth unto us the way of life! Our loins therefore being
   girt with faith and the observance of good works, and our feet shod
   with the guidance of the Gospel of peace, let us walk in His ways, that
   we may deserve to see in His kingdom Him Who has called us. [9]

   If we desire to dwell in the tabernacle of this kingdom, it can only be
   by running the way of good works, whereby alone it can be reached. But
   let us ask our Lord with the Prophet saying to Him: "Lord, who shall
   dwell in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy hill?" [10]
   After this question, Brethren, let us hear our Lord answering and
   showing us the way to His tabernacle, saying: "He that walketh without
   spot and worketh justice. He that speaketh truth in his heart, that
   hath not forged guile with his tongue. He that hath not forged guile
   with his tongue. He that hath not done evil to his neighbour and hath
   not received reproach against him." [11]

   He that rejecting out of his mind the malignant devil with his
   suggestions, hath brought them all to nought, and taking his thoughts
   while they are still young, hath dashed them against the rock Christ.
   [12] All they who fearing the Lord, take not pride in their good
   observance, but knowing that all the good they have, or can do,
   proceedeth not from themselves, but from the Lord, magnify Him, thus
   working in them, and say with the Prophet: "Not to us O Lord, not to
   us, but to Thy Name give glory." [13] Thus the Apostle Paul imputed not
   anything of his preaching to himself, saying: "By the grace of God I am
   what I am." [14] And again he saith: "He that glorieth, let him glory
   in the Lord." [15]

   Hence also our Lord saith in the Gospel: "He that heareth these My
   words and doth them,--I will liken him to a wise man that hath built
   his house upon a rock. The floods came, the winds blew, and beat
   against that house, and it fell not; because it was founded upon a
   rock." [16] Our Lord fulfilling these things, daily waiteth for us to
   answer by our deeds, these His holy admonitions. Therefore the days of
   our life are prolonged for the amendment of our evil deeds, according
   to those words of the Apostle: "Knowest thou not that the patience of
   God leadeth thee to repentance?" [17] For our loving Lord saith: "I
   will not the death of the sinner, but that he be converted and live."
   [18]

   Having therefore, my Brethren, enquired of our Lord who shall be the
   dweller in this tabernacle, we have heard the precept to the one
   dwelling, and if we fulfil the functions of this habitation we shall
   become heirs of the kingdom of heaven. Therefore our hearts and bodies
   must be prepared to fight under the holy obedience of His commands, and
   we must beg our Lord to supply that, by the assistance of His grace,
   which our nature is unable to perform. And if flying the pains of hell
   we will to attain to everlasting life, we must, while yet time serves,
   and we live in this flesh, perform all these things by the light of
   faith, and haste to do that now which will be expedient for us for ever
   hereafter.

   We are therefore now about to institute a school of the service of God;
   in which we hope nothing will be ordained rigorous or burdensome. But
   if in some things we proceed with a little severity, sound reason so
   advising, for the amendment of vices or preserving of charity; do not
   straightway for fear thereof, flee from the way of salvation which is
   always strait and difficult in the beginning. [19] But in process of
   time and growth of faith, when the heart has once been enlarged, the
   way of God's commandments is run with unspeakable sweetness of love; so
   that, never departing from His teaching, but persevering in the
   Monastery in His doctrine until death, we share now by patience in the
   sufferings of Christ, that we may deserve afterwards to be partakers of
   His kingdom. [20]

  CHAPTER I.

   Of the several kinds of Monks.

   It is well known that there are four kinds of Monks. The first are
   Cenobites, that is Monastics, living under a Rule or Abbot. The second
   are Anchorites or Hermits, who, not in the first fervour of conversion,
   but after long probation in the monastic life, have learnt to fight
   against the devil, and taught by the encouragement of others, are now
   able by God's assistance to strive hand to hand against the flesh and
   evil thoughts, and so go forth well prepared, from the army of the
   Brotherhood, to the single combat of the wilderness. The third and
   worst kind of Monks are the Sarabiaites, who have never been tried
   under any Rule, nor by the experience of a master, as gold is tried in
   the furnace, but being soft as lead, and by their works still cleaving
   to the world, are known by their tonsure to lie to God.

   These in twos or threes, or perhaps singly, and without a shepherd, are
   shut up, not in our Lord's sheepfolds, but in their own: the pleasure
   of their desires is to them a law; and whatever they like or make
   choice of, they will have to be holy, but what they like not, that they
   consider unlawful.

   The fourth kind of Monks are called "Gyrovagi," or wanderers, who
   travel about all their lives through divers provinces, and stay for two
   or three days as guests, first in one monastery, then in another; they
   are always roving, and never settled, giving themselves up altogether
   to their own pleasures and to the enticements of gluttony, and are in
   all things worse that the Sarabites. Of their miserable way of life it
   is better to be silent than to speak. Therefore leaving these, let us,
   by God's assistance, set down a Rule for Cenobites, or Conventuals, who
   are the most steadfast class of Monks.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER II.

   What kind of man the Abbot ought to be.

   An Abbot who is worthy to have charge of a Monastery ought always to
   remember what he is called, and in his actions show forth the character
   of Ancient. For in the Monastery he is considered to represent the
   person of Christ, seeing that he is called by His name, as the Apostle
   saith: "Ye have received the spirit of the adoption of children, in
   which we cry, Abba, Father." [21] Therefore the Abbot ought not (God
   forbid) to teach, ordain, or command but what is conformable to the
   commands of our Lord: but let his commands and doctrine be mingled in
   the minds of his disciples with the leaven of diving justice.

   Let the Abbot always be mindful that, in the dreadful judgment of God,
   he must give an account both of his doctrine and of the obedience of
   his disciples, and let the Abbot know that any lack of profit which the
   Master of the family shall find in his sheep, will be laid to the
   shepherd's fault. But if he have bestowed all diligence on his unquiet
   and disobedient flock, and employed the utmost care to cure their
   corrupt manners, he shall then be acquitted in the judgment of the
   Lord, and may say with the Prophet: "I have not hidden thy justice in
   my heart, I have told thy truth and thy salvation, [22] but they
   contemned and despised me." [23] And then finally, death shall be
   inflicted as a just punishment upon the disobedient sheep.

   When, therefore, anyone receives the name of Abbot, he ought to govern
   his disciples with a twofold doctrine; that is, he ought first to show
   them all virtue and sanctity, more by deeds than by words: hence, to
   such as are intelligent, he may declare the commandments of God by
   words; but to the hard-hearted, and to those of the ruder sort, he must
   make the divine precepts manifest by his actions. In the next place,
   let him show by his own deeds, that they ought not to do anything which
   he has taught them to be unfitting, lest, having preached well to
   others, "he himself become a castaway," [24] and God say unto him thus
   sinning: "Why dost thou declare My justices, and take My testament in
   thy mouth? Thou hast hated discipline, and cast My speeches behind
   thee, [25] And,--"Thou, who didst see the mote in thy brother's eye,
   hast thou not seen the beam that is in thine own?" [26]

   Let him make no distinction of persons in the Monastery. Let not one be
   loved more than another, except he be found to surpass the rest in good
   works and in obedience. Let not one of noble parentage, on coming to
   Religion, be put before him who is of servile extraction, except there
   be some other reasonable cause for it. If, upon just consideration, the
   Abbot shall think there is such a just cause, let him put him in any
   rank he shall please, but otherwise, let every one keep his own place;
   because "whether bondman or freeman, we are all one in Christ" [27] ,
   and bear an equal burthen of servitude under one Lord: "for with God
   there is no accepting of persons." [28] On one condition only are we
   preferred by Him, and that is, if in good works and in humility we are
   found better than others. Therefore let the Abbot bear equal love to
   all; and let all be subject to the same discipline, according to their
   deserts.

   For the Abbot ought always, in his doctrine, to observe that apostolic
   form wherein it is said; "Reprove, entreat, rebuke." [29] That is to
   say, he ought, as occasions require, to temper fair speeches with
   threats: let him show the severity of a master and the loving affection
   of a father: those who are undisciplined and restless he must reprove
   sternly, but with such as are obedient, mild and patient, he should
   deal by entreaty, exhorting them to go forward in virtue. But the
   stubborn and negligent we charge him to severely reprove and chastise.
   Let him not shut his eyes to the sins of offenders, but, as soon as
   they show themselves, use all possible endeavours utterly to root them
   out, remembering the fate of Heli, the Priest of Silo. [30] With the
   more virtuous and intelligent, let him for the first or second time use
   words of admonition; but the stubborn, the hard-hearted, the proud and
   the disobedient, even in the very beginning of their sin, let him
   chastise with stripes and bodily punishment, knowing that it is
   written: "The fool is not corrected with words." [31] And again:
   "Strike thy son with the rod, and thou shalt deliver his soul from
   death." [32]

   The Abbot ought always to remember what he is, and what he is called,
   and know that unto whom more is entrusted, from him more is exacted,
   and let him consider how difficult and hard a task he hath undertaken,
   to govern souls, and to accommodate himself to the humours of many,
   some of whom must be led by fair speeches, others by sharp
   reprehensions, and others by persuasion. Therefore let him so adapt
   himself to the character and intelligence of each one, that he may not
   only suffer no loss in the flock committed to him, but may even rejoice
   in the increase and profit of his virtuous flock.

   Above all things, let him take heed not to slight or make little
   account of the souls committed to his keeping, and have more care for
   fleeting, worldly things than for them; but let him always consider
   that he hath undertaken the government of souls for which he shall also
   have to give an account. And that he may not complain for want of
   temporal means, let him remember that it is written: "Seek ye first the
   kingdom of God and His justice, and all things shall be given ye." [33]
   And again: "Nothing is wanting to such as fear Him." [34]

   Let him know that the man who undertakes the government of souls must
   prepare himself to give an account of them. And how great soever the
   number of brethren may, let him know certain that at the day of
   judgment he will have to give to the Lord an account for all their
   souls as well as for his own. Thus, by fearing the examination which
   the shepherd must undergo for the flock committed to his charge, he is
   made solicitous on other men's account as well as careful on his own;
   and while reclaiming them by his admonitions, he is himself freed from
   all defects.

  CHAPTER III.

   Of calling the brethren to council.

   As often as any weighty matters have to be debated in the monastery,
   let the Abbot call together all the Brethren, and himself declare what
   is the point under deliberation. Having heard their counsel, let him
   prudently weigh it with himself, and then do what he shall judge most
   expedient. The reason why we ordain that all be called to Council, is
   because the Lord often revealeth to the younger what is best. And let
   the Brethren give their advice with all subjection and humility, and
   presume not stiffly to defend their own opinion, but rather leave it to
   the discretion of the Abbot; and what he shall think more expedient, to
   that, let them all submit; for, as it becometh the disciples to obey
   their master, so doth it behove the master to dispose all things with
   forethought and justice.

   In all things, therefore, let all follow the Rule as their master, and
   from it let no man rashly swerve. Let no one in the monastery follow
   his own will. Neither let anyone presume, within or without the
   monastery, to contend insolently with his Abbot. If he do so, let him
   be subjected to regular discipline. Let the Abbot, however, do all
   things with the fear of God, and in observance of the Rule, knowing
   that he shall undoubtedly give an account of all his judgments to God,
   the most just Judge. If any matters of less moment have to be done for
   the benefit of the monastery, let him take counsel with the seniors
   only, as it is written: "Do all things with counsel, and thou shalt not
   afterwards repent thee of it." [35]

  CHAPTER V.

   Of the obedience of disciples.

   The first degree of humility is obedience without delay. This beseemeth
   those who, either on account of the holy servitude they have professed,
   through fear of hell or for the glory of life everlasting, count
   nothing more dear to them than Christ. These, presently, as soon as
   anything is commanded them by the Superior, make no delay in doing it,
   just as if the command had come from God. Of such, our Lord saith: "At
   the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed me." [109] And to teachers He
   saith: "He that heareth you, heareth me." [110] Therefore, such as
   these, leaving immediately everything, and forsaking their own will,
   leave unfinished what they were about, and with the speedy foot of
   obedience follow by deeds the voice of him who commands. And thus, as
   it were in one and the same moment the command of the master and the
   perfect work of the disciple in the speed of the fear of God, go both
   jointly together, and are quickly effected by those who ardently desire
   to advance in the way of eternal life. These take the narrow way, of
   which the Lord saith: "Narrow is the way which leadeth to life." [111]
   They live not according to their own will, nor follow their own desires
   and pleasures, but, abiding in monasteries, walk according to the
   command and direction of another, and will to have an Abbot over them.
   Without doubt these fulfil that saying of our Lord: "I came not to do
   my own will, but the will of Him Who sent me." [112]

   This obedience will then be acceptable to God and pleasing to men, if
   what is commanded be not done fearfully, slowly, coldly, or with
   murmuring, or an answer showing unwillingness; because the obedience
   which is given to superiors is given to God, Who hath said: "He that
   heareth you, heareth Me." [113] Hence it ought to be done by the
   disciples with a good will, because God "loveth a cheerful giver" [114]
   If the disciple obey with ill-will, and murmur, not only in words, but
   also in heart, although he fulfil what is commanded him, it will not be
   acceptable to God, Who considereth the heart of the murmurer. For such
   a work he shall not have any reward, but rather incurreth the penalty
   of murmurers, unless he amend and make satisfaction.

  CHAPTER VI.

   Of Silence.

   Let us act in accordance with that saying of the Prophet; "I have said:
   I will keep my ways, that I offend not with my tongue. I have been
   watchful over my mouth: I held my peace and humbled myself, and was
   silent from speaking even good things." [115] If therefore, according
   to this saying of the Prophet we are at times to abstain, for silence
   sake, even from good talk, how much more ought we to refrain from evil
   words, on account of the penalty of sin. Therefore, because of the
   importance of silence, let leave to speak be seldom given, even to
   perfect disciples, although their words be of good and holy matters,
   tending unto edification; because it is written: "In much speaking,
   thou shalt not escape sin." [116] And in another place: "Death and life
   are in the hands of the tongue." [117] For it befitteth a master to
   speak and teach; and it beseemeth a disciple to hold his peace and
   listen.

   If, therefore, anything must be asked of the Prior, let it be done with
   all fitting humility and the subjection of reverence. But as for
   buffoonery, idle words, or such as move to laughter, we utterly condemn
   and exclude them in all places, nor do we allow a disciple to open his
   mouth to five them utterance.

  CHAPTER VII.

   Of Humility.

   The Holy Scripture crieth to us, Brethren, saying: "Everyone who
   exalteth himself shall be humbled, and he who humbleth himself shall be
   exalted." [118] By these words it declares to us, that all exaltation
   is a kind of pride, which the Prophet showeth must carefully be avoided
   when he says: "Lord, my heart is nor exalted, neither are my eyes
   lifted up: neither have I walked in great things, nor in wonders above
   myself." But why? "If I did not think humbly, by exalted my soul: as a
   child weaned from his mother, so wilt Thou reward my soul." [119]

   Wherefore, Brethren, if we would attain to the highest summit of
   humility, and speedily reach that heavenly exaltation, which is won
   through the lowliness of this present life; by our ascending actions a
   ladder must be set up, such as appeared in sleep to Jacob, whereon he
   saw Angels descending and ascending.

   That descent and ascent signifieth nothing else, but that we descend by
   exalting, and ascend by humbling ourselves.

   The latter thus erected, is our life here in this world, which through
   humility of heart is lifted up by our Lord to heaven. The sides of this
   ladder we understand to be our body and soul, in which the Divine
   Vocation hath placed divers degree of humility and discipline, which we
   must ascend.

   The first degree, then, of humility is that a man always have the fear
   of God before his eyes, and altogether fly forgetfulness. Moreover to
   be mindful of all that God hath commanded, and remember that such as
   contemn God fall into hell for their sins, and that everlasting life is
   prepared for such as fear Him. And keeping himself every moment from
   all sin and vice, of thought, word, eyes, hands, feet, and self will,
   let him thus hasten to cut off the desires of the flesh.

   Let him think that he is always beheld from Heaven by God; that all his
   actions, wheresoever he may be, lie open to the eye of God, and are at
   every hour presented before Him by His Angels. The Prophet declareth
   this, when, in these words, he saith that God is always present to out
   thoughts: "God searcheth the heart and reins." [120] And again: "The
   Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vain." [121] He also
   saith: "Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off," [122] and: "The
   thought of man shall confess to Thee." [123] In order therefore that
   the humble Brother may be careful to avoid evil thoughts, let him
   always say in his heart: "Then shall I be without spot before Him, if I
   shall keep me from my iniquity." [124]

   The Scripture also forbiddeth us to do our own will, saying: "Leave thy
   own will and desire." [125] And again: "We beg of God in prayer, that
   His Will may be done in us." [126]

   With good reason, therefore, are we taught to beware of doing our own
   will, when we keep in mind that which the Scripture saith: "There are
   ways which to men seem right, and end whereof plungeth even into the
   deep pit of hell." [127] And again when we fear that which is said of
   the negligent: "They are corrupted, and made abominable in their
   pleasures." [128] But in the desires of the flesh, we ought to believe
   God to be always present with us, according to that saying of the
   Prophet, speaking to the Lord: "O Lord, all my desire is before Thee."
   [129]

   Let us then take heed of evil desires, because death sitteth close to
   the entrance of delight. Wherefore the Scripture commandeth us: "Follow
   not thy concupiscences." [130] If then the eyes of the Lord behold both
   good and bad; if He ever looketh down from heaven upon the sons of men
   to see who is understanding or seeking God: if our works are told to
   Him day and night by our Angels; we must always take heed, Brethren,
   lest, as the Prophet saith in the Psalm, "God behold us some time
   declining to evil, and become unprofitable;" [131] and though He spare
   us for the present, because He is merciful, and expecteth our
   conversion, He may yet say to us hereafter: "These things thou hast
   done, and I have held My peace." [132]

   The second degree of humility is, if anyone, not wedded to his own
   will, seeks not to satisfy his desires, but carries out that saying of
   our Lord: "I came not to do My own Will, but the Will of Him Who sent
   Me." [133] The scripture likewise saith: "Self-will engendereth
   punishment, and necessity purchaseth a crown."

   The third degree of humility is, that a man submit himself for the love
   of God, with all obedience to his superior, imitating thereby our Lord,
   of Whom the Apostle saith: "He was made obedient even unto death."
   [134]

   The fourth degree of humility is, that if, in obedience, things that
   are hard, contrary, and even unjust be done to him, he embrace them
   with a quiet conscience, and in suffering them, grow not weary, nor
   give over, since the Scripture saith: "He only that persevereth to the
   end shall be saved." [135] And again, "Let thy heart be comforted, and
   expect the Lord." [136] And showing that the faithful man ought to bear
   all things for our Lord, be they never so contrary, it saith in the
   person of the sufferers: "For Thee we suffer death all the day long; we
   are esteemed as sheep for the slaughter." [137] And being assured by
   hope of a reward from God's Hands they go on rejoicing and saying: "But
   in all things we overcome by the help of Him Who hath loved us." [138]
   Likewise in another place the Scripture saith: "Thou hast proved us, O
   Lord, Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried, with fire. Thou hast
   brought us into the snare; Thou hast laid tribulation upon our backs."
   [139] And to shew that we ought to be under a Prior it goes on to say:
   "Thou hast placed men over our heads." [140] Moreover, in order to
   fulfil the precepts of the Lord by patience in adversities and
   injuries: "When struck on one cheek, they offer the other; to him who
   taketh away their coat, they leave their cloak also; and being
   constrained to carry a burthen one mile, they go two." [141] With Paul
   the Apostle they suffer false Brethren and persecutions, and bless
   those who speak ill of them. [142]

   The fifth degree of humility is to manifest to the Abbot, by humble
   confession, all the evil thoughts of his heart, and the secret faults
   committed by him. The Scripture exhorteth us thereunto, saying: "Reveal
   thy way to the Lord, and hope in Him." [143] And again: "Confess thy
   way to the Lord because He is good, because His mercy endureth for
   ever." [144] Furthermore the Prophet saith: "I have made known unto
   Thee mine offence, and mine injustices I have not hidden. I have said,
   I will declare openly against myself mine injustices to the Lord; and
   Thou hast pardoned the wickedness of my heart." [145]

   The sixth degree of humility is, if a Monk be content with all that is
   meanest and poorest, and in everything enjoined him, think himself an
   evil and worthless servant, saying with the Prophet: "I have been
   brought to nothing, and knew it not. I have become as a beast before
   Thee, and I am always with Thee." [146]

   The seventh degree of humility is, not only to pronounce with his
   tongue, but also in his very heart to believe himself to be the most
   abject, and inferior to all; and humbling himself, to say with the
   Prophet: "I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast
   of the people. [147] I have been exalted, humbled, and confounded."
   [148] And again: "It is good for me that Thou hast humbled me, that I
   may learn thy commandments." [149]

   The eighth degree of humility is, that a Monk do nothing but what the
   common rule of the Monastery, or the examples of his seniors, exhort
   him to do.

   The ninth degree of humility is, for a Monk to refrain his tongue from
   speaking, and be silent till a question be asked him, remembering the
   saying of the Scripture: "In many words thou shalt not avoid sin,"
   [150] and "a talkative man shall not be directed upon the earth." [151]

   The tenth degree of humility is, not to be easily moved and prompt to
   laugh, for it is written: "The fool exalteth his voice to laughter."
   [152]

   The eleventh degree of humility is that when a Monk speaketh, he do so,
   gently and without laughter; humbly, with gravity or few words, and
   discreetly; and be not clamorous in his voice; for it is written: "A
   wise man is known by few words." [153]

   The twelfth degree of humility is, that a Monk not only have humility
   in his heart, but show it also in his exterior, to all the behold him;
   so that whether he be at the work of God, in the Oratory, the
   monastery, the garden, on the way, in the field or wherever he may be,
   whether he sit, walk, or stand, let him always, with head bent down,
   and eyes fixed upon the earth, think of himself guilty for his sins,
   and about to be presented before the dreadful judgment of God, ever
   saying to himself with the Publican in the Gospel: "Lord, I a sinner am
   not worthy to lift up mine eyes to heaven." [154] And again with the
   Prophet: "I am bowed down and humbled on every side." [155]

   Thus, when all these degrees of humility have been ascended, the Monk
   will presently come to that love of God which is perfect and casteth
   our fear; to that love, whereby everything, which at the beginning he
   observed through fear, he shall now begin to do by custom, without any
   labour, and as it were naturally; not now through fear of hell, but for
   the love of Christ, our of a good custom, and a delight in virtue. All
   this our Lord will vouchsafe to work by the Holy Ghost in His servant,
   now that he is cleansed from defects and sins.

  CHAPTER VIII.

   Of the Divine Office at night-time.

   In winter, that is from the first of November till Easter, they shall
   rise at that time which reasonable calculation shall indicate as the
   eighth hour of the night, in order that having rested till a little
   after midnight, they may rise refreshed. As for the time that remains
   after Matins, let it be employed in study, by those Brethren who are
   somewhat behind-hand in the psalter and lessons. But from Easter till
   the first of November, let the hour for Matins be so arranged, that
   after a short interval during which they may go forth for the
   necessities of nature, Lauds may presently follow about the break of
   day.

   In winter, having first said the verse, "O God incline unto mine aid, O
   Lord make haste to help me," [156] the words, "O Lord open my lips, and
   my mouth shall declare Thy praise," [157] are next to be repeated three
   times After this the third Psalm is said, with a "Glory be to the
   Father," at the end. Then the ninety-fourth Psalm is to be recited or
   sung with an antiphon. Let hymn follow next, and then six psalms with
   antiphons. These being said, and a versicle added, let the Abbot give a
   blessing, and then, all being seated, let three lessons be read by the
   Brethren in turns, from the book lying on the lectern. After every
   lesson, let a responsory be sung. Let two of them be without a
   "Gloria," but after the third let it be added by the Cantor, and as
   soon as he has begun it, let all rise from their seats our of honour
   and reverence to the Holy Trinity.

   Let the divinely inspired books, both of the Old and New Testament, be
   read at Matins, together with the expositions made upon them by the
   most famous, orthodox, and Catholic Fathers. After these three lessons
   and their responsories, let six other psalms follow, to be sung with an
   Alleluia. Then let a lesson from the Apostle be said by heart, and
   after that a verse and the supplication of the Litanies, that is,
   "Kyrie eleison." And thus let the Matins or Night-watches be brought to
   an end.

  CHAPTER X.

   How Matins, or Night-office, is to be celebrated in Summer.

   From Easter till the first of November, let the same number of psalms
   be recited, as we have before appointed; but let not the lessons be
   read, because of the shortness of the nights. Instead of these three
   lessons, let one out of the Old Testament be said by heart, followed by
   a short responsory, and let all the rest be performed as we have before
   arranged, so that without counting the third, and the ninety-fourth
   psalms, there be never fewer than twelve psalms said at Matins.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XI.

   How Matins, or Night-office, is to be celebrated on Sundays.

   On Sunday, let them rise more seasonably for Matins, and therein
   observe the following order. When six psalms and the versicle have been
   sung, as we before arranged, let all sit down in a becoming and orderly
   manner, and let four lessons with the responsories be read from the
   book; to the forth responsory only, let the Cantor add a "Gloria," at
   the beginning of which all shall rise out of reverence. After these
   lessons, let six more psalms follow in order, with their antiphons and
   versicle as before. Then let four other lessons with their responsories
   be read in the same way as the former. Next, let three canticles be
   said our of the Prophets, such as the Abbot shall appoint; these must
   be sung with "Alleluia."

   When the versicle has been said, and the Abbot has given his blessing,
   let four other lessons out of the New Testament be read, in the same
   order as before.

   After the fourth responsory, let the Abbot begin the Hymn "Te Deum
   laudamus," and this being said, let him read a lesson from the Gospel,
   with reverential fear while all stand. At the end of this let all
   answer "Amen", and then let the Abbot go on with the Hymn: "Te decet
   alus." Then, after the giving of the blessing, let Lauds begin. This
   order is always to be observed in singing Matins on Sundays, both in
   summer and in Winter, except perchance (which God forbid) they rise
   late, for then the lessons or responsories must be somewhat shortened.
   But let good care be taken that this do not happen; and if it do, let
   him, by whose negligence it comes to pass, make satisfaction for it in
   the Oratory.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XII.

   How the solemnity of Lauds is to be performed.

   For Sunday's Lauds, first, let the sixtieth Psalm be said plainly,
   without an antiphon; after which, say the fiftieth with an "Alleluia;"
   then the hundred-and-seventeenth, and the sixty-second; then the
   "Blessings," [158] and "Praises" [159] , one lesson out of the
   Apocalypse said by heart, a responsory, a hymn, a versicle with a
   canticle out of the Gospel, and the Litanies, and so conclude.

   [159] Pss. cxlviii. cxlix, cl. of which almost every verse begins by
   the word "Laudate," were called "Laudes".
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIII.

   How Lauds are to celebrated on ferial or week days.

   On ferial days, let Lauds be celebrated thus: Let the sixty-sixth Psalm
   be said as on Sunday, plainly and without an antiphon, and also
   somewhat more slowly, in order that all may be in their places for the
   fiftieth, which must be said with an antiphon. After which, let two
   other psalms be said according to custom; that is, on Monday, the fifth
   and thirty-fifth. On Tuesday, the forty-second and fifty-sixth. On
   Wednesday, the sixty-third and sixty-fourth. On Thursday, the
   eighty-seventy and eighty-ninth. On Friday, the seventy-fifth and
   ninety-first. On Saturday, the hundred-and-forty-second and the
   Canticle of Deuteronomy, which must be divided into two "Glorias." But
   on other days, let the Canticle out of the Prophets be said, each on
   its own day, according to the practice of the Roman Church. After
   these, let the Praises follow; then a lesson from the Apostles, to be
   said by heart, a responsory, hymn, and versicle, a Canticle out of the
   Gospel, the Litanies, and so conclude.

   Let not the celebration of Lauds, or Evensong, ever terminate, unless
   at the end, the Lord's prayer be said by the Prior, in the hearing of
   all, because of the thorns of scandal which are wont to arise; that the
   Brethren, being reminded by the covenant of this prayer, in which they
   say: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them the trespass against
   us", may purge themselves from these faults. But in celebrating the
   other hours let the last part only be said aloud, that all may answer:
   "But deliver us from evil."
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIV.

   In what manner the Office of Matins is to be celebrated on the Feast
   days of Saints.

   On Saints' days, and upon all solemnities, let the same order be
   observed as upon Sundays, only that psalms, antiphons, and lessons be
   said, proper to the day itself. Their method, however, shall remain the
   same as before determined.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XV.

   At what seasons "Alleluia" must be said.

   From the holy feast of Easter until Whitsuntide, let "Alleluia" be said
   without intermission, as well with the psalms, as with the
   responsories. From Whitsuntide till the beginning of Lent, let it be
   said at all the Night-Offices, with the six last psalms only. But on
   every Sunday out of Lent, let the Canticles, Lauds, Prime, Tierce, Sext
   and None, be said with "Alleluia." Let Even-song, however, be said with
   antiphons. Let the responsories never be said with "Alleluia," except
   from Easter till Whitsuntide.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVI.

   In what manner the Work of God is to be done in the day time.

   "Seven times a day", saith the Prophet. "have I sung praises unto
   Thee." [160] This sacred number of seven shall be accomplished by us if
   at the times of Lauds, Prime, Tierce, Sext, None, Even-song, and
   Complin, we perform the duties of our service. It was of these hours
   the Prophet said: "

   Seven times in the day I have sung praises to Thee." For of the
   Night-watches, the same Prophet says: "At midnight I did arise to
   confess to Thee." [161] At these times therefore, let us give praise to
   our Creator for the judgments of His justice; that is at Lauds, Prime,
   Tierce, Sext, None, Even-song, and Complin; and in the night let us
   rise to confess unto Him.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   How many psalms are to be said during the aforesaid hours.

   We have already arranged the order of the Office for the Nocturns, or
   Lauds; let us now dispose of the Hours that follow. At Prime, let three
   psalms be said separately, and not under one "Gloria." Presently after
   the verse: "O God incline unto mine aid," let the hymn of the same Hour
   follow, before the psalms be begun. At the end of the psalms, let there
   be recited one lesson, a versicle, and "Kyrie eleison," and let that
   Hour conclude with a collect. Tierce, Sext, and None, are to be recited
   in the same way; that is, the prayer, versicle, and hymns of these same
   Hours, three psalms, then a lesson, versicle, and "Kyrie eleison", and
   let the Hour conclude with a collect. If the community be great, let
   the Hours be sung with antiphons; if, however, it be small, let them be
   only recited. Let Even-Song be said with four psalms and antiphons;
   after these let a less on be recited, then a responsory, the hymn,
   versicle, and canticle, our of the Gospel--the Litany, the Lord's
   Prayer, and a collect to conclude. For Complin, let three psalms be
   recited straight on without antiphons. After these, the hymn for that
   Hour, the lesson, versicle, "Kyrie eleison", and blessing, and so let
   the Hour terminate.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XVIII.

   In what order the psalms are to be said.

   In the day Hours, let the verse "O God incline unto mine aid, O Lord
   make haste to help me," always be said first, and after it a "Gloria."
   Then the hymn proper to each Hour. On Sundays, at Prime, there must be
   said four divisions of the hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm. At the rest of
   the Hours, to wit, at Tierce, Sext and None, let there be said three
   divisions of the same hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm. But on Monday at
   Prime, let three psalms be said, that is, the first, second, and sixth.
   In the same way at Prime, let three psalms be said in order every day,
   till Sunday, as far as the nineteenth Psalm: yet in such a way that the
   ninth and seventeenth Psalms be divided into two "Glorias." Thus it
   will fall out that on Sunday at Matins we shall always begin from the
   twentieth Psalm.

   At Tierce, Sext, and None, on Mondays, let the remaining nine divisions
   of the hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm be said, three at a time, during
   these same Hours. On two days therefore, to wit, Sunday and Monday, the
   hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm being gone through, let the psalms at
   Tierce, Sext, and None, on Tuesdays be sung in order, three at a time,
   from the hundred-and nineteenth to the hundred-and-twentyseventh, that
   is nine psalms. These psalms are always to be repeated at the same
   Hours for the rest of the week till Sunday; a uniform order also of the
   hymns, lessons, and versicles, being sung every day observed, so that
   every Sunday they may being with the hundred-and-eighteenth Psalm.

   Even song is to be sung every day with four psalms, which are to begin
   from the hundred-and-ninth, and go on to the hundred-and-forty-seventh,
   such only being excepted as are set apart for other Hours, that is,
   from the hundred-and-seventeenth, to the hundred-and-twenty-seventh,
   and from the hundred-and-thirty-third to the hundred-and-forty-second;
   all the rest are to be said in Even-song. And because there fall three
   psalms short, those of the aforesaid number that are longer, must be
   divided, that is, the hundred-and-thirty-eighth, the hundred-and-forty
   third, and the hundred-and-forty-fourth. But let the
   hundred-and-sixteenth, because it is short, be joined with the
   hundred-and-fifteenth.

   The order, therefore, of the psalms for Evensong being set down, let
   other matters such as lessons, responsories, hymns, versicles, and
   canticles, be arranged as before. At Complin let the same psalms be
   repeated every day: the is, the fourth, ninetieth, and the
   hundred-and-thirty-third. The order of the day office being thus
   disposed of, let all the psalms which remain be equally portioned out
   into seven Night-Watches, or Matins, and such of them as are too long,
   divided into two. Let twelve psalms be appointed for every night. If
   this arrangement and distribution of the psalms displease anyone, let
   him, if he think good, order them otherwise, provided however he take
   care, that every week the whole psalter of one hundred-and-fifty psalms
   be sung; and that on Sunday at Matins, they begin it again; for Monks
   show themselves to be over negligent and indevout, who do not in the
   course of a week sing over the psalter with the usual canticles, since
   we read that our holy Fathers courageously performed in one day, what,
   God grant, that we who are negligent and tepid, may perform in a whole
   week.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XIX.

   Of the order and discipline of singing.

   We believe that the Divine Presence is everywhere, and that the eyes of
   the Lord behold both the good and the bad, in all places; but we
   believe this especially and without any doubt, when we assist at the
   Word of God. Let us, therefore, always be mindful of what the Prophet
   saith: "Serve ye the Lord in fear." [162] And again: "Sing ye His
   praises with understanding." [163] And: "In the sight of Angels I will
   sing praise unto Thee." [164] Therefore, let us consider in what manner
   it behoveth us to be in the sight of God and of the Angels, and so let
   us sing in choir, that mind and voice may accord together.

  CHAPTER XX.

   Of reverence at prayer.

   If, when we wish to make some suggestion to the powerful, we presume
   not to speak to them except with humility and reverence; with how much
   greater reason ought we to present our supplications in all humility
   and purity of devotion, to the Lord God of all things? And let us bear
   in mind, that we shall be heard, not for our many words, but for our
   purity of heart, and our penitential tears. [165] Our prayer,
   therefore, ought to be short and pure, unless perchance it be prolonged
   by the inspiration of Diving Grace. Yet, let all prayer made in common
   be short, and when the sign has been given by the Prior, let all rise
   together.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [165] Matth. vi. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXI.

   Of the Deans of the Monastery.

   If the Community be large, let men of good repute and saintly lives be
   chosen from among the Brethren and appointed Deans, to be careful over
   their Deaneries in all things, according to the command of God, and the
   precepts of their Abbot. Let such men be chosen for Deans as the Abbot
   may safely rely upon to share his burthens; and let them not be chosen
   by order, but according to the merit of their lives and learning. And
   if perchance any of them, being puffed up with pride, shall be found
   blameworthy, and being thrice rebuked, shall show no sign of amendment,
   let him be put out of office, and a more worthy man substituted in his
   place. Concerning the Provost, we make the same ordinance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXII.

   How the Monks are to sleep.

   Let them sleep, each in separate beds, and receive, according to the
   appointment of the Abbot, bedclothes befitting their condition. If it
   be possible, let them all sleep in one place; but if the number do not
   allow of this, let them repose by tens or twenties in one place with
   their Seniors who have care of them. And let a candle burn constantly
   in that same cell until morning. Let them sleep clothed, and girt with
   girdles or cords, but let them not have knives by their sides while
   they sleep, lest perchance they be hurt therewith; and thus let the
   Monks always be ready, that when the sign is given they may rise
   speedily, and hasten, each one, to come before his Brother to the Work
   of God, but yet with all gravity and modesty.

   Let not the younger Brethren have beds in a place apart by themselves,
   but separated among the Elders. And when they rise to the work of God,
   let them gently encourage one another, because of the excuses of those
   who are sluggish.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIII.

   Of excommunication for offences.

   If any Brother be found stubborn, disobedient, proud, murmuring, or in
   any way gainsaying the holy Rule, or contemning the orders of his
   Elders, let him, in accordance with the precept of the Lord, be once or
   twice secretly admonished by them. If he amend not, let him be
   reprehended publicly before all. But if in spite of all this he do not
   correct himself, let his be subjected to excommunication, provided he
   understand the nature of the punishment. But if he remain obstinate,
   let him undergo corporal chastisement.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXIV.

   What the manner of excommunication ought to be.

   The measure of excommunication or punishment should be meted out
   according to the quality of the faults; but the estimation of their
   gravity shall depend upon the judgment of the Abbot. If any Brother be
   found guilty of small faults, let him be deprived of eating at table
   with the rest. The manner of his punishment shall be as follows: In the
   Oratory he shall not intone a psalm or antiphon, nor read a lesson,
   until he has made satisfaction. He shall take his portion of food after
   the Brethren have taken theirs, in such quantity, and at such time as
   the Abbot shall deem fit. If, for example, the Brethren take their
   refection at the sixth hour, let him take his at the ninth; if the
   Brethren take theirs at the ninth, let him take his in the evening,
   until by due satisfaction he obtain pardon.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXV.

   Of more grievous faults.

   Let that Brother who is guilty of more grievous faults be denied both
   the table and the Oratory. Let none of the Brethren discourse with him
   not keep him company. Let him be alone at the work enjoined him,
   continuing in penance and sorrow, knowing that terrible sentence of the
   Apostle, who saith, "That such a one is delivered over to Satan for the
   destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of
   our Lord." [166] Let him take his portion of food alone, in such
   measure and at such time as the Abbot shall think fit: let not anyone
   bless him as he passes by, not the food that is given to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [166] I. Cor. v. 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVI.

   Of those who keep company with the excommunicated without the command
   of the Abbot.

   If any Brother shall presume, without the command of the Abbot, to join
   himself in any way to the excommunicated Brother, or to talk with him,
   or send him a message, let him incur the same penalty of
   excommunication.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVII.

   How the Abbot ought to care for the excommunicated.

   Let the Abbot have a special care of the offending Brethren, for, "They
   that are well need not the physician, but they that are sick." [167] He
   ought, therefore, like a wise physician, to use every means in their
   regard, and covertly send them as comforters, some elderly and discreet
   Brothers to console, as it were secretly, the wavering one, and win him
   to make humble satisfaction. Let them comfort him, that he be not
   swallowed up by overmuch sorrow, but as the Apostle saith: "Let charity
   be confirmed towards him, and let all pray for him." [168]

   The Abbot ought especially to have care, and with all prudence and
   industry, to see that he lose none of the sheep committed to his
   charge. Let him know that he hath undertaken the care of sick souls,
   and not a tyrannical authority over such as are well. Let him fear the
   threat of the Prophet, by whom God saith; "What ye saw to be fat, that
   ye took to yourselves, and what was diseased, that ye threw away."
   [169] Let him imitate the loving kindness of the "Good Shepherd," Who
   "leaving ninety-nine sheep in the mountains, went to seek one that had
   gone astray, on whose infirmity He took such compassion, that He
   vouchsafed to lay it on His own sacred shoulder, and thus carry it back
   to the flock." [170]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXVIII.

   Of those who, being often corrected, do not amend.

   If any Brother after being corrected, or even excommunicated for any
   fault, doth not amend, let a sharper correction be administered to him:
   that is to say, let him be punished with stripes. But if for all that
   he do not correct himself, or being puffed up with pride (which God
   forbid) shall also defend his doings; then let the Abbot act like a
   wise physician, and after applying the fomentations and ointments of
   exhortation, the medicines of the Divine Scriptures, and last of all
   the punishment of excommunication and of scourging; then, if he find
   that his labours have no effect,--let him add what is more that all
   this,--his own prayer, and the prayer of the Brethren for him, that the
   Lord, Who can do all things, would vouchsafe to work a cure upon the
   infirm Brother. If he be not healed and corrected by this means, then
   let the Abbot use the sword of separation, according to that saying of
   the Apostle: "Put away the evil one from among you." [171] And again:
   "If the faithless one depart, let him depart," [172] lest one diseased
   sheep should infect the whole flock.

  CHAPTER XXIX.

   Whether the Brethren who leave the monastery ought to be received
   again.

   If that Brother, who through his own fault leaveth, or is cast out of
   the Monastery, be willing to return, he shall first promise to amend
   the fault for which he went forth; then let him be received into the
   lowest rank, that by this, his humility may be tried. If he go out
   again, let him be received back till the third time. But after this let
   him know that all entrance will be denied him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXX.

   How children are to be corrected.

   Every age and understanding ought to have a measure of government
   suitable to it. As often therefore as children, or those under age,
   commit faults, and are incapable of understanding the greatness of the
   punishment of excommunication, let them be punished by rigorous
   fasting, or sharp stripes, that so they may be corrected.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXI.

   What kind of man the Cellarer of the monastery ought to be.

   Let there be chosen out of the Community as Cellarer of the Monastery,
   a man who is wise, ripe in manners, and sober; not a great eater, not
   haughty, nor hasty, nor insulting; not slow, nor wasteful, but fearing
   God, and acting as a father to the whole Brotherhood. Let him have care
   of all things, and without the command of the Abbot do nothing. Let him
   take heed of all that is ordered, and not sadden his Brethren. But if
   any Brother shall perchance ask anything of him that is not reasonable,
   let him not, by contemptuously spurning, grieve him, but reasonable and
   with all humility refuse what he asks for amiss.

   Let him have regard for his own soul, mindful of that rule of the
   Apostle: "They that have ministered well, shall purchase for themselves
   a good degree." [173] Let him care diligently for the sick, the
   children, the guests, and the poor; knowing, without doubt, that for
   all these he shall give an account on the judgment day. Let him look
   upon all the vessels and goods of the Monastery as if they were the
   sacred vessels of the Altar. Let him neglect nothing; neither let him
   be covetous, nor prodigal, not wasteful of the goods of the Monastery,
   but do all things with moderation, and according to the command of his
   Abbot.

   Above all things, let him have humility, and give at least a gentle
   answer unto him, on whom he hath nothing else to bestow; for it is
   written: "A good word is above the best gift." [174] Let him have under
   his care all that the Abbot shall appoint, and presume not to meddle
   with anything from which he shall forbid him. Let him give to the
   Brethren their appointed allowance of food, without arrogance or delay,
   that they be not scandalised; mindful of that divine word which tells
   what punishment he deserves "Who shall scandalise one of these little
   ones." [175] If the Community be large, let there be given to him
   helpers, by whose aid he may quietly perform the office committed to
   his charge. Let such things as are to be given or asked for, be given
   and asked for at suitable hours, that no one may be troubled or
   saddened in the House of God.

  CHAPTER XXXII.

   Of the iron tools, or goods of the monastery.

   For keeping the iron tools, clothes, or other goods belonging to the
   Monastery, let the Abbot appoint Brethren, of whose life and
   conversation he may be sure, and to them let him allot all things to be
   kept, as he shall judge most expedient. Of these let the Abbot keep a
   list, that as the Brethren succeed each other in their various
   occupations, he may know what he gives and what he receives. If any one
   shall use the property of the Monastery in a slovenly or negligent
   manner, let him be rebuked. If he does not amend, let him be subjected
   to regular discipline.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIII.

   Whether monks ought to have anything of their own.

   Especially let this vice be cut away from the Monastery by the very
   roots, that no one presume, without leave of the Abbot, to give, or
   receive, or hold as his own, anything whatsoever, either book, or
   tablets, or pen, or anything at all; because they are men whose very
   bodies and wills are not in their own power. But all that is necessary
   they may hope for from the Father of the Monastery; nor can they keep
   anything which the Abbot has not given or allowed. Let all things be
   common to all, as it is written: "Neither did any one say to think that
   aught was his own." [176] If any one shall be found given to this most
   wicked vice, let him be admonished once or twice, and if he do not
   amend, let him be subjected to correction.

  CHAPTER XXXIV.

   Whether all ought equally to receive what is needful.

   As it is written: "Distribution was made to every one, according as he
   had need." [177] By this, we do not say that there should be accepting
   of persons, which God forbid, but that due consideration should be
   shown to each one's infirmities. Therefore, let him who needeth less,
   give God thanks, and be not grieved; and let him who needeth more, be
   humbled for his infirmity, and not lifted up for the mercy that is
   shown him; and thus all the members shall be in peace. Above all
   things, take heed there be no murmuring, by word or sign, upon any
   occasion whatsoever, If any one shall be found faulty in this respect,
   let him be subjected to most severe discipline.

  CHAPTER XXXV.

   Of the weekly servers in the kitchen.

   The Brethren are so to serve each other, that no one be excused from
   the office of the kitchen, unless he be hindered by sickness or other
   business of more profit; because a greater reward is gotten thence. But
   let the weaker Brethren have help, that they may do their work without
   sadness; and let all generally have help according as the number of the
   Community, and the situation of the place, shall require. If the
   Community be great, let the Cellarer be excused from the kitchen, and
   as we have said before, such as are employed in matters of greater
   profit. Let the rest serve each other in charity. On Saturday, let him
   who endeth his week in the kitchen make all things clean. Let him wash
   the towels wherewith the Brethren wipe their hands and feet, and let
   both him who goeth out and him who cometh in, wash the feet of all. He
   shall hand over to the Cellarer, clean and whole, all the vessels of
   his office, and the Cellarer shall deliver them to him who entereth
   upon his office, that he may know what he giveth and what he receiveth.
   Let these weekly Officers, one hour before refection, take each a
   draught of drink and a piece of bread over and above the appointed
   allowance, that at the hour of refection they may serve their Brethren
   without murmuring or great labour. Nevertheless, on solemn days let all
   forbear till after Mass. On Sunday, immediately after Lauds both the
   out-going and the in-coming officers for the week, shall cast
   themselves upon their knees before all, and ask to be prayed for. Let
   him that hath ended his office say the verse: "Blessed art Thou, O Lord
   God, Who didst help me, and console me," [178] which being thrice
   repeated, he shall receive the blessing. Let him who entereth upon his
   office follow immediately after and say: "O God incline unto mine aid,
   O Lord make haste to help me." [179] Let this likewise be thrice
   repeated by all, and having received the blessing, let him enter upon
   his office.

  CHAPTER XXXVI.

   Of the sick Brethren.

   Before all things, and above all things, special care must be taken of
   the sick, so that they may be served in very deed, as Christ Himself,
   for He saith: "I was sick, and ye visited Me." [180] And "What ye did
   to one of these My least Brethren, ye did to Me." [181] But let the
   sick themselves bear in mind that they are served for the honour of
   God, and must not grieve the Brethren who serve them by their
   extravagant demands. Nevertheless, they must patiently be borne with,
   because there is gotten from such a more abundant reward. Therefore let
   the Abbot take special care they be not neglected.

   Let a separate cell be set apart for their use, and an attendant that
   is God-fearing, diligent and careful. As often as it shall be
   expedient, let the use of baths be allowed the sick; but to such as are
   in health, and especially to the young, let it be seldom granted.
   Moreover the sick and weakly may be allowed the use of flesh meat for
   their recovery. As soon, however, as they get better, they must all,
   after the accustomed manner, abstain from meat. Let the Abbot take
   special care that the Cellarer or attendants neglect not the sick,
   because whatever is done amiss by his disciples, is imputed to himself.

  CHAPTER XXXVII.

   Of old men and children.

   Although man's nature is of itself drawn to feel pity for these two
   ages, that is, for the old and for children, yet it is fitting that the
   authority of the Rule should provide for them. Let their weakness
   therefore be always taken into account, and the rigour of the Rule with
   regard to food, be by no means kept with them. Let a kind consideration
   be had for them, and let leave be granted them, to eat before the
   regular hours.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXVIII.

   Of the weekly reader.

   Reading ought not to cease while the Brethren eat at table. Neither
   ought anyone presume to read, who shall take up the book at haphazard;
   but let him who is appointed to read for the whole week, enter upon his
   office on Sunday. After Mass and communion, let him ask all to pray for
   him, that God may keep from him the spirit of pride. And let this verse
   be thrice repeated in the Oratory by all, the Reader first beginning
   it: "O Lord Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy
   praise;" [182] and thus having received a blessing, let him enter upon
   his duty. The greatest silence shall be kept, so that no muttering, or
   voice, shall be heard, except the voice of the Reader.

   Such things as are necessary for meat and drink, let the Brethren so
   minister to each other, that no one need ask for anything. Yet should
   anything be wanted, let it be asked for rather by a sign than by a
   word. Nor let anyone presume to ask questions, about what is being
   read, or about anything else, lest occasion be given to the evil one.
   Should the Prior, however, think fit, he may make some brief
   exhortation for the edification of the Brethren. And let the Brother
   who is Reader for the week take a little pottage before he begin to
   read, on account of Holy communion, and lest perchance it be grievous
   for him to fast so long. Afterwards let him eat with the weekly
   Officers and servers of the kitchen. The Brethren must not read or sing
   in turns, but such only as may edify the hearers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] Ps. l. 17.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XXXIX

   Of the measure or quantity of meat.

   We think it sufficient for daily refection, both at the sixth and ninth
   hour, that there be at all seasons two dishes, because of the
   infirmities of different people; so that he who cannot eat of one, may
   make his meal of the other. Let therefore two dishes of hot food
   suffice for the Brethren, and if there be any apples or young
   vegetables, let them be added as a third dish. Let one pound weight of
   bread suffice for the day, whether there be one refection, or both
   dinner and supper. If they are to sup, let a third part of that pound
   be reserved by the Cellarer, to be put before them at supper.

   If their labour be great, it shall be in the power of the Abbot to add
   what he shall think fitting to their ordinary allowance; taking care
   always to avoid surfeiting, that the Monks be not overtaken with
   indigestion, because there is not sin more contrary to a Christian than
   gluttony, as our Lord saith: "Take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your
   hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness." [183] But to
   children to tender age, let not the same quantity be given, but less
   than to the older, in all things preserving frugality. Let all, except
   the very weak and the sick, abstain from eating the flesh of
   four-footed beasts.

  CHAPTER XL.

   Of the measure of drink.

   Every one hath his proper gift from God, one thus, another thus." [184]
   Therefore it is not without some misgiving, that we appoint the measure
   of other men's victuals. Yet considering the condition of those in weak
   health, we think that one pint of wine will be sufficient for each one
   every day. But let those upon whom God bestows the gift of abstinence
   know, that they shall receive the proper reward. It, however, the
   situation of the place, labour, or the heat of summer, require more,
   let the Prior do what he thinketh good; ever having a care that
   fullness, or gluttony creep not in. And although we read [185] :that
   wine is not at all the drink of Monks," yet, because in these our
   times, they will not be so persuaded, let us at least agree to this,
   not to drink to satiety, but sparingly, "Because wine maketh even the
   wise to fall away." [186] Where, however, the poverty of the place will
   not allow the appointed measure, but much less, or perhaps none at all,
   let those who live there praise God and murmur not. This we admonish
   above all things, that there never be any murmuring.

  CHAPTER XLI.

   At what hours the Brethren are to take their Refections.

   From the holy Feast of Easter until Whitsuntide, let the Brethren take
   their refection at the sixth hour, and their supper at night. But from
   Whitsuntide, throughout the whole summer, let them fast on Wednesdays
   and Fridays till the ninth hour, unless they have to labour in the
   fields, or the extremity of the heat oppress them; but on other days
   let them dine at the sixth hour. This hour for dinner shall be
   continued at the discretion of the Abbot, if they have work in the
   fields, or the heat of summer be great. Let him so moderate and dispose
   all things that souls may be saved, and that what the Brethren do, may
   be done without just complaint. But from the thirteenth of September
   till the beginning of Lent, let the Brethren always take their meal at
   the ninth hour.

   From the beginning of Lent till Easter, they shall take their meal in
   the evening; yet, let things be so ordered, that there be no need of
   lamps during the refection, but that all be done by daylight. At all
   times let the hour for supper and for dinner be so arranged that all
   things be done by daylight.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLII.

   That no one may speak after Complin.

   Monks ought to keep silence at all times, but especially during the
   hours of the night; and therefore on all days, whether of fast or not,
   let them all come together, presently after supper if it be not a
   fasting-day, and let one read the "Collations," or Lives of the
   Fathers, or something else which will edify the hearers; nor, however,
   the Heptateuch, or Book of Kings, for it will not be profitable for
   weak understandings to hear this part of Scripture at that hour; yet at
   other times it may be read. But if it be a fasting-day, let them, as we
   have said come to the reading of the Collations shortly after
   Even-song. Then let them read four or five pages, or as many as the
   time will allow, in order that during reading, all, even such as have
   had some work enjoined them, may have assembled together. All being
   gathered together, let them say Complin, after which no one shall be
   permitted to speak. If anyone shall be found to break this rule of
   silence, let him be liable to the most severe punishment; except there
   be some necessary cause, such as the arrival of guests, or the command
   of the Abbot. Yet, even in that case, let it be done with the greatest
   gravity and moderation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIII.

   Of those who come late to the work of God or to table.

   As soon as the signal for Divine Office shall be heard, each one,
   laying aside whatever occupation he may happen to be engaged in, shall
   hasten with all speed, and yet with gravity, lest an occasion be given
   for light behaviour. Let nothing, therefore, be preferred to the Work
   of God. If any one shall come to Matins after the "Gloria" of the
   ninety-fourth Psalm, which we would have said slowly and leisurely for
   this very purpose, let him not stand in his order in the choir, but
   last of all, or in a place which the Abbot shall have set apart for
   such negligent people; that he may be seen by him and by all the rest,
   till the Work of God be ended, thus and do penance and make public
   satisfaction.

   We have judged it fitting they should stand in the last place, or
   apart, for this reason; that being seen by all, they may for very
   shame's sake amend. For if they remain outside the Oratory, some one
   will perchance either return to his cell and sleep, or at least sit
   without, and, abandoning himself to idle talk, give an occasion to the
   evil one. Let him therefore enter in, that he may not lose all, and may
   be amended for the time to come. In the day Hours, let him that shall
   come to the Work of God, after the verse "Deus in adjutorium," and
   "Gloria" of the first Psalm, stand last, as directed above, and not
   presume to join himself to the choir of singers until he has made
   satisfaction, unless the Abbot shall, by his permission, give him
   leave; on condition, however, that he afterwards make amends for his
   fault.

   He that cometh not to table before the verse, "Oculi omnium," or,
   "Edent pauperes," so that all may say the verse and pray, and all at
   once sit down to table together, shall be corrected once or twice, if
   this have happened through his own fault or negligence. And if he do
   not afterwards amend, let him not be admitted to a share of the common
   table, but being separated from the company of his Brethren, let him
   eat alone, and let his portion of wine be taken away from him, till be
   make satisfaction and amend his ways. He shall suffer the like penalty,
   who is not present at the verse "Confiteantur," or. "Memoriam," that is
   said after meat. And let not any one presume to take meat or drink
   before or after the appointed time. Moreover, if anything be offered to
   a Brother by the Prior and that Brother refuse it, but afterwards have
   a mind for it, he shall receive neither that, nor anything else, until
   he have made suitable atonement.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIV.

   How those who are excommunicated, are to make satisfaction.

   At the hour when the Work of God is being celebrated in the Oratory,
   let him, who for more grievous offences is excommunicated from the
   table or Oratory, lie prostrate before the doors thereof saying
   nothing; only with his head upon the ground, let him lie at the feet of
   all who go out of the Oratory. This he shall do until the Abbot think
   he hath given sufficient satisfaction. When ordered by the Abbot, he
   shall cast himself at the Abbot's feet, and then at the feet of all the
   Brethren that they may pray for him.

   Then, if the Abbot shall order it, let him be received into the Choir,
   and stand in that rank which he shall appoint; yet so that he presume
   not to intone a psalm, or read a lesson in the Oratory, or do anything
   else unless the Abbot again order him. After each Hour, when the Work
   of God is finished, let him cast himself upon the earth in the place
   where he stands, and in this manner make satisfaction, until the Abbot
   commands him to cease therefrom. But let such as for slight faults are
   excommunicated only from the table, make satisfaction in the Oratory as
   long as the Abbot shall command, and let them continue their
   satisfaction until he bless them and say:--"It is enough."
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLV.

   Of those who commit any fault in the Oratory.

   If any one, while reciting a psalm, responsory, antiphon, or lesson,
   shall make any mistake and not forthwith atone for it before all, let
   him be liable to greater punishment, as one who will not correct by
   humility, what he hath done amiss through negligence. But for such a
   fault, let children be beaten.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVI.

   Of those who offend in lighter matters.

   If any one, while engaged in labour, either in the kitchen or the
   cellar, or in the service of others, in the bakehouse, the garden, or
   in any other occupation, shall do anything amiss, or break or lose
   anything, or offend in any other way, and do not come presently before
   the Abbot or Community, and of his own accord confess and make
   satisfaction for his offence; when that is made known by another, he
   shall be more severely punished. But if the fault be a secret sin, let
   him manifest it to the Abbot only, or to his spiritual Seniors, who
   know how to heal their own wounds, and not to disclose or publish those
   of others.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVII.

   Of making known the hour for the work of God.

   Let the Abbot take care, both night and day, to signify the hour for
   the Work of God, either by announcing it himself, or by intrusting the
   duty of so doing to some watchful Brother, in order that all things may
   be done at their appointed times. But after the Abbot, let such as have
   been appointed, each in his own order, intone the psalms or antiphons.
   Let not any one presume to sing or read unless he have skill enough to
   do so, unto the edification of the hearers. Whomsoever the Abbot shall
   appoint to do this, let him do it with humility, gravity, and the fear
   of God,
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLVIII.

   Of daily manual labour.

   Idleness is an enemy of the soul. Therefore the Brethren ought to be
   employed at certain times in labouring with their hands, and at other
   fixed times in holy reading. Wherefore we think that both these
   occasions may be well ordered thus: From Easter till the first of
   October, let them, on going forth from Prime, labour at whatever they
   are required till about the fourth hour. From the fourth, till close
   upon the sixth hour, let them be employed in reading. On rising from
   table after the sixth hour, let them rest on their beds with all
   silence, or if perchance any one shall desire to read, let him read in
   such a way as not to disturb any one else.

   Let None be said seasonable, at about the middle of the eighty hour,
   and after that let them work at what they have to do till the evening.
   If the situation of the place, or their poverty require them to labour
   in reaping their corn, let them not be saddened thereat, for then are
   they Monks in very deed, when they live by the labour of their hands,
   as our Fathers and the Apostles did before us. Yet let all things be
   done with moderation for the sake of the fainthearted.

   From the first of October till the beginning of Lent, they shall be
   employed in reading till the second hour complete, when Tierce shall be
   celebrated, and from that till the ninth hour, let them labour at
   whatever work is enjoined them. At the first signal of the ninth hour,
   let them all leave off work, so as to be ready when the second signal
   is given. After their refection they shall be employed in reading
   spiritual books, or the psalms.

   But in Lent they must read from morning till the third hour complete,
   then let them work till the end of the tenth hour, at what is enjoined
   them. In these days of Lent, let each one have a book from the Library,
   and read it all through in order. The books must be given at the
   beginning of Lent. Let one or two Seniors be specially appointed to go
   about the Monastery at the hours in which the Brethren are employed in
   reading, and see that no one be slothful or give himself up to idleness
   or foolish talk, and neglect his reading, being thus not only
   unprofitable to himself, but also a hindrance to others. If such a one
   be found (which God forbid!) let him be reprehended once or twice, and
   if he do not amend, let him be so severely corrected, that others may
   take warning by it. Neither let one Brother associate himself with
   another at unseasonable times.

   On Sunday all shall devote themselves to reading, except such as are
   deputed for the various offices. But if any one shall be so negligent
   and slothful as to be either unwilling or unable to meditate or read,
   let him have some work imposed upon him which he can do, and thus not
   be idle. To the Brethren who are of weak constitution or in delicate
   health, such work or art shall be given as shall keep them from
   idleness, and yet not oppress them with so much labour as to drive them
   away. Their weakness must be taken into consideration by the Abbot.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER XLIX.

   Of the observance of Lent.

   Although a Monk's life ought at all times to resemble a continual Lent,
   yet because few have such virtue, we exhort all in these days of Lent
   to live in all purity, and during this holy season to wash away all the
   negligences of other times. This we shall worthily accomplish if we
   refrain from all defects, and apply ourselves to tearful prayer, to
   reading, to compunction of heart, and abstinence. In these days,
   therefore, let us add something over and above to our wonted task, such
   as private prayers, and abstinence from meat and drink; let every one
   offer to God, of his own free will, with joy of the Holy Ghost,
   something above the measure appointed him; that is to say, let him
   withold from his body something in the way of food, drink, sleep, talk,
   laughter, and with spiritual joy and desire, await the holy feast of
   Easter. Nevertheless, let each one acquaint the Abbot with what he
   offers, and do it at his desire and with his consent; because whatever
   is done without the permission of the spiritual Father, shall be
   imputed to presumption and vain glory, and merit no reward. All things,
   therefore, must be done with the approbation of the Abbot.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER L.

   Of the Brethren who work at a great distance from the Oratory, or are
   on a journey.

   The Brethren who work at a great distance; and, in the Abbot's
   judgment, are unable to come to the Oratory in due time, shall fall
   upon their knees in the place where they are labouring, and there
   perform the Work of God with divine fear. Also, those who are sent on a
   journey shall not allow the appointed hours to pass by, but perform
   them on the way as they are best able, and omit not to accomplish their
   task of Divine Service.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LI.

   Of the Brethren who do not go far off.

   Let not the Brother who goes forth upon any errand, and intends to
   return that same day to the Monastery, presume to eat while abroad,
   even though invited to do so, unless perchance he has the Abbot's
   orders. If he do otherwise, let him be excommunicated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LII.

   Of the Oratory of the Monastery.

   Let the Oratory be what its name signifieth, and let nothing else be
   done or treated of there. When the Work of God is ended, let all go
   forth with exceeding great silence, and let respect be paid to the
   presence of God, in order that the Brother who wishes to pray
   privately, may not be hindered from so doing by the misconduct of
   another. If any other Brother should also wish to pray secretly, let
   him enter without ostentation and pray, not with a loud voice, but with
   tears and earnestness of heart. Therefore, let not any one remain in
   the Oratory after the Work of God is ended, except for the purpose of
   prayer, lest he be a hindrance to others.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LIII.

   Of the manner of entertaining guests.

   Let all guests who come to the Monastery be entertained like Christ
   Himself, because He will say: "I was a stranger and ye took Me in."
   [187] Let due honour be paid to all, especially to those who are of the
   household of the Faith, and to travellers. As soon, therefore, as a
   guest is announced, let the Prior or the Brethren go to meet him with
   all show of charity. First let them pray together, and so be associated
   to each other in peace. The kiss of peace shall not be offered till
   after prayer, because of the illusions of the devil. And in the
   salutation itself let all humility be shewn. By bowing the head or
   prostrating on the ground before all the guests who come or go, let
   Christ Who is received in their persons be also adored in them.

   When the guests have been received, let them be brought to prayer, and
   after that, the Prior, or any one whom he shall order, shall sit with
   them. Let the Divine Law be read before the guest, that he may be
   edified, and afterwards let all courtesy be shown them. For his sake,
   the Prior shall break the fast ordained by the Rule, unless perchance
   it be one of those special days, on which it cannot be broken. The
   Brethren, however, shall keep their accustomed fast. Let the Abbot pour
   water on the hands of the guests, and let both him and the whole
   Community wash the feet of the same, after which they shall say this
   verse: "We have received Thy mercy, O God, in the midst of Thy temple."
   [188] But let the poor, and strangers especially, be diligently
   entertained with all care, because in them Christ is more truly
   received. For the simple fear of the rich doth beget them honour.

   Let the kitchen for the Abbot and the guests stand apart, in order that
   the latter, who are never wanting in a monastery, may not disquiet the
   Brethren by their untimely arrivals. Into this kitchen let two
   Brothers, who can perform its duties well, enter for a year. They shall
   have assistance when they need it, in order that they may serve without
   murmuring. When they have less labour, let them go forth to work where
   they shall be appointed. And not only in these, but in all other
   offices of the Monastery, let consideration be shown them, so that when
   they need help, it be given, and when they are without work, they obey
   and do what is commanded them.

   Let the care of the guest-room be entrusted to a Brother, whose soul
   the fear of God possesseth. Let there be a sufficient number of beds
   there, and let the House of God be by wise men wisely governed. By no
   means let any one, unless appointed thereunto, either mix with, or
   speak to the guests; but if he shall meet or see them, after humbly
   saluting and asking their blessing, he shall pass on, saying that it is
   not lawful for him to talk with a guest.

  CHAPTER LIV.

   Whether it be lawful for a Monk to receive letters or presents.

   By no means let any Monk, without the Abbot's permission, receive from
   his parents or from anyone else, or give to another, letters, tokens,
   or any gifts whatsoever. And if anything be sent to him, even from his
   parents, let him not presume to receive it, unless it be first told the
   Abbot. If he order it to be received, it shall be in his power to
   appoint the person to whom it shall be given; and let not the Brother,
   to whom perchance it was sent, be grieved, lest an occasion be given to
   the devil. Whosoever shall presume to do otherwise, shall be subjected
   to regular discipline.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LV.

   Of the clothes and shoes of the Brethren.

   Let clothing be given to the Brethren suitable to the place where they
   live, and to the temperature of the air; because in cold countries more
   is needed, and in warm, less. The arrangement of all this shall be left
   to the discretion of the Abbot. Nevertheless we believe that for
   temperate places, it will be sufficient for each Monk to have a cowl
   and tunic: the cowl in winter to be of thicker stuff, but in summer
   finer and worn thin; also a scapular for work, and shoes and stockings
   to cover their feet. Let not the Monks find fault with the colour or
   coarseness of things; they shall be such as can be procured in the
   country where they live, or bought at the cheapest rate.

   Let the Abbot take care of their dimensions, that they be not too
   short, but of a size suitable to those who wear them. On receiving new
   clothes, let them always give up the old ones at once, to be laid by in
   the wardrobe for the poor. For it is sufficient for a Monk to have two
   tunics and two cowls, as well for change at nights, as for the
   convenience of washing. Anything beyond this is superfluous and must be
   cut off. Also, they shall give back their shoes, and whatever is worn
   out, when they receive anything new. When sent on a journey, they shall
   receive drawers from the wardrobe, and on their return shall restore
   them washed clean. Let their cowls and tunics on such occasions be
   somewhat better than those they ordinarily use. They shall receive them
   on setting out, and restore them to the wardrobe on their return.

   Let a straw mattress, a blanket, coverlet and pillow, suffice for their
   bedding. This the Abbot shall frequently examine, to prevent the vice
   of proprietorship; and if any one be discovered to possess anything
   which he hath not received from the Abbot, let him be subjected to the
   severest correction. To root out this vice, let all things be given
   them by the Abbot which shall be necessary, that is, a cowl, a tunic,
   shoes, and stockings, a girdle, a knife, a pen, a needle, a
   handkerchief, and tablets, that all pretence of necessity may be taken
   away. However let the Abbot always bear in mind that sentence from the
   Acts of the Apostles: "And distribution was made to every one according
   as he had need." [189] Let him, therefore, consider the infirmities of
   such as are in need, and pay no regard to the ill-will of the envious.
   In all his ordinances let him always think on the retribution of God.

  CHAPTER LVI.

   Of the Abbot's Table.

   The Abbot shall always take his meals with the guests and strangers.
   But as often as there are few guests, it shall be in his power to
   invite any of the Brethren he may choose. Let him take care, however,
   that one or two Seniors be always left with the Brethren, for the sake
   of discipline.

  CHAPTER LVII.

   Of the artificers of the Monastery.

   If there be Artificers in the Monastery, let them exercise their crafts
   with all humility, provided the Abbot shall have ordered them. But if
   any of them be proud of the skill he hath in his craft, because he
   thereby seemeth to gain something for the Monastery, let him be removed
   from it, and not exercise it again, unless, after humbling himself, the
   Abbot shall permit him.

   But if any of their work is to be sold, let those who make the bargain
   take heed and presume not to defraud the Monastery in any way. Let them
   remember Ananias and Saphira, [190] lest they, or any who defraud the
   Monastery, should incur the death of their soul, and these did the
   death of their body. And in the prices themselves, let not the vice of
   avarice creep in, but let things always be sold somewhat cheaper than
   by Seculars, that in all things God may be glorified.

  CHAPTER LVIII.

   Of the manner of receiving Brothers to Religion.

   Let not an easy entrance be granted to one who cometh newly to
   Religious life, but, as the Apostle saith: "Try the Spirits if they be
   of God." [191] If, therefore, the newcomer persevere knocking, and
   continue for four or five days patiently to endure both the injuries
   offered to him and the difficulty made about his entrance, and persist
   in his petition; leave to enter shall be granted him, and he shall be
   in the guest Hall for a few days. Afterwards he shall be in the
   Novitiate, where he shall meditate, and eat, and sleep.

   Let a Senior who has the address of winning souls, be appointed to
   watch over him narrowly and carefully, to discover whether he truly
   seeks God, and is eager for the Work of God, for obedience and for
   humiliation. Let all the rigour and austerity by which we tend towards
   God be laid before him. And if he promise stability and perseverance,
   at the end of two months, let the whole Rule be read to him, with the
   addition of these words: "Behold the law under which thou desirest to
   fight; if thou canst observe it, enter in; if thou canst not, freely
   depart." If he shall still persevere, let him then be brought back to
   the aforesaid cell of the Novices, and be again tried in all patience.
   After the lapse of six months, let the Rule be read to him again, that
   he may know unto what he has come. If he still persevere, after four
   months, let the same Rule be read to him once more. If he shall then
   promise, after due deliberation, to observe all things and to do
   everything commanded him, let him be received into the Community,
   knowing that he is from that time forward under the law of the Rule, so
   that he can neither leave the Monastery nor shake off the yoke of the
   Rule, which, after so long a deliberation, he might have accepted or
   refused.

   And when they admit him to profession, he shall, in the presence of
   all, make a promise before God and His saints, of stability, amendment
   of manners, and obedience, in order that if at any time he shall act
   contrariwise he may know that he shall be condemned by Him Whom he
   mocketh. He shall draw up the form of this promise in the name of the
   Saints whose relics are on the Altar, and of the Abbot there present.
   With his own hand shall he write it, or if he knoweth not how, another
   at his request shall write it for him, and the Novice shall put his
   mark to it, and lay it with his own hand upon the Altar.

   After doing this, let him presently begin the verse: "Uphold me O lord
   according to Thy Word, and I shall live, and let me not be confounded
   in my expectation." [192] Let the whole Community repeat this three
   times, adding at the end, "Glory be to the Father." Then let the new
   Brother cast himself at the feet of all, that they may pray for him,
   and from that hour he shall be counted as one of the Community. If he
   hath any property, he shall either first bestow it upon the poor, or by
   a formal gift, hand it over to the Monastery, without any reserve for
   himself; because for the future he must know that he hath not so much
   as power over his own body. Let him therefore presently, in the
   Oratory, be stripped of his own garments and be clothed in those of the
   Monastery. But the garments of which he is divested shall be kept in
   the wardrobe, that if (which God forbid) he should consent, by the
   persuasion of the devil, to leave the Monastery, he may be stripped of
   his habit and expelled. But he shall not have again the writing of his
   profession which the Abbot received from him at the Altar; that shall
   be kept in the Monastery.

  CHAPTER LIX.

   Of the sons of nobles, or of the poor that are offered.

   If any nobleman shall perchance offer his son to God in the Monastery,
   let the parents, if the child himself be under age, make the aforesaid
   promise for him, and together with the oblation [193] let them wrap
   that promise and the hand of the boy in the Altar Cloth, and thus
   dedicate him to God. But with regard to his property, they shall, in
   the said document, promise under oath, that they will never either give
   or furnish him with an occasion of having anything, either by
   themselves, or by any other person or means whatsoever. If they will
   not do this, but wish to offer something as an alms to the Monastery,
   by way of acknowledgment, let them make a donation of whatsoever they
   please, and reserve the income of it to themselves. Let matters be so
   managed that no expectation remain with the child, whereby being
   deceived he may perish (which God forbid). As we have learnt by
   experience in the case of others. Let those who are poorer act in the
   same way. But such as have nothing whatever, shall simply make the
   promise, and with the oblation give up their son, before witnesses.

  CHAPTER LX.

   Of priests who desire to dwell in the Monastery.

   If any one of the priestly order shall request to be received into the
   Monastery, let not permission be speedily granted even unto him.
   However, if he shall still persist in his request, let him know that he
   will have to keep all the discipline appointed by the Rule, and that no
   relaxation will be made in his favour, according to that which is
   written: "Friend, for what art thou come?" [194] Nevertheless he shall
   be allowed to stand next after the Abbot, to give the blessing, and to
   say Mass, provided the Abbot order him. Otherwise he shall presume to
   do nothing, knowing that he is subject to regular discipline, and
   particularly obliged to give unto all examples of humility. If his
   position in the Monastery shall have been given to him on account of
   his Order, or for any other reason whatsoever, let him remember that
   his true place is the one fixed by the time of his entrance, and not
   that which was yielded to him out of reverence for his Priesthood. But
   if any Cleric shall likewise desire to be admitted into the Monastery,
   let him be put in a middle rank, but only on condition that he promise
   observance of the Rule and stability in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXI.

   Of monks that are strangers, how they are to be received.

   If any Monk who is a stranger shall come from distant places and desire
   to dwell in the Monastery as a guest, and being content with the
   customs he findeth there, doth not trouble the Monastery by his
   superfluous wants, but is satisfied with what he findeth, let him be
   entertained for as long a time as he desireth. And if he reasonable,
   and with loving humility, reprehend or point out any abuse, let the
   Abbot prudently take notice of what he saith; for the Lord hath
   perchance sent him for that very reason. But if, after a time, he
   should desire to take up his abode there, let him not be refused;
   especially since they had ample opportunities for discovering his
   manner of life, during the time he lived among them as a guest.

   If, however, during that time he was found troublesome or faulty, not
   only shall he not be incorporated with the Community, but even be told
   with all civility to depart, lest others should be corrupted by his bad
   behaviour. But if he doth not deserve to be sent away, not only let him
   be received into the society of the community, when he makes the
   request, but let him even be persuaded to stay, that by his example
   others may be instructed; because in every place we serve one God, and
   fight under one King.

   The Abbot may also put him in a somewhat higher rank, if he shall find
   him well deserving of it. And not only may the Abbot exalt a Monk to a
   higher place than is his due, but also any of the aforesaid Priests or
   Clerics, if their lives be such as to deserve it. Let the Abbot,
   however, beware never at anytime to receive a Monk into his Community
   from a known Monastery, without the consent of his Abbot, or letters of
   commendation from him, because it is written: "What thou wilt not have
   done to thyself, do not thou to another." [195]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [195] Matth. vii. 12.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXII.

   Of the priests of the Monastery.

   If any Abbot desire to have a Priest or Deacon promoted to Holy Orders,
   let him choose from his Monks, one who is worthy to fill the office of
   Priesthood. But let him that is ordained beware of haughtiness and
   pride, and presume not to do anything except what is ordered by the
   Abbot; well aware, that he is now much more subject to the discipline
   of the Rule. Let him not, by reason of his priesthood, forget the
   obedience and discipline of the Rule, but rather strive to advance more
   and more in the service of God.

   He shall, however, take his rank from the time he entered the
   Monastery, except in his office at the Altar, and also, in case the
   Community's choice and the Abbot's desire be to advance him higher for
   his holiness of life. He must, nevertheless, observe the rules
   prescribed by the Deans or Provosts, and if he presume to act
   contrariwise, he shall be judged, not as a Priest, but as a rebel. If
   after frequent admonitions he do not amend, the Bishop shall be
   informed of his behaviour. If even after this he grow not better, and
   his faults become notorious, he shall be thrust out of the Monastery,
   provided his disobedience be such that he will not submit and obey the
   Rule.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXIII.

   Of the order of the Community.

   The Brethren shall hold that rank in the Monastery which is fixed for
   them by the time of their conversion, by the merit of their life, or by
   the appointment of the Abbot. And let not the Abbot disquiet the flock
   committed to him, not, as it were by an arbitrary use of power, arrange
   anything unjustly; but let him always consider that he is to give an
   account to God of all his judgments and of all his works.

   Therefore, let the Brethren receive the Pax, approach to Communion,
   intone a psalm, and stand in choir, according to that order which he
   shall appoint, or which they hold among themselves. In all places
   without exception, let not order be decided by age, neither let it be a
   prejudice to any man; for Samuel and Daniel, though mere youths, sat in
   judgment upon the elders. [196] With the exception, therefore, of those
   whom for special reasons the Abbot shall advance or loser, let all the
   rest keep the order of the conversion. For example: He who cometh to
   the Monastery at the second hour of the day must know that he is lower
   than the man who came at the first hour, no matter what his age or
   dignity may be. But with regard to children, let them be kept under
   discipline on all occasions, by all indiscriminately.

   Let the Juniors, therefore, honour their Seniors, and the Seniors love
   the Juniors. But in addressing each other by name, no one shall call
   another by his simple name; let the Seniors call the Juniors Brothers,
   and let the Juniors call the Seniors Fathers out of reverence.

   But because the Abbot representeth the person of Christ, he shall be
   called "Domnus," and "Abbot," not as if he took this title upon
   himself, but out of honour and love of Christ. Let him remember to
   conduct himself in such a way, as to be worthy of so great honour.

   Wheresoever the Brethren meet each other, let the Junior ask a blessing
   from the Senior. When the Senior passeth by, let the Junior rise, and
   give place to him to sit down. Nor shall the Junior presume to sit with
   him, unless his Senior bid him do so, in order to accomplish that which
   is written: "In honour preventing one another." [197] Little children,
   youths, shall keep their respective places in the oratory or at table
   with due discipline. Elsewhere, careful watch shall be kept over them,
   till they come to the age of understanding.

  CHAPTER LXIV.

   Of the election of the Abbot.

   In the election of an Abbot let the following method always be
   observed; that he be constituted Abbot whom either the whole Community
   by common consent shall elect in the fear of God, or whom a small part
   of the same, shall choose with greater wisdom. Let him who is to be
   raised to this dignity be chosen on account of his virtuous life, his
   learning, and his wisdom; even though he be the last in the Community.
   But although the entire Community (which God forbid) shall with one
   accord choose a man who supports them in their evil practices, and
   these, by some means become known to the Bishop in whose diocese that
   place is situated, or to the Abbots, or to the neighbouring Christians;
   let them nullify the election of these wicked men, and appoint a worthy
   steward over the House of God; knowing that for this they shall receive
   a good reward, if they do it with a pure intention, and through zeal
   for God; and, on the contrary, that they sin if the neglect to do so.

   When once established in his office, let the Abbot always reflect how
   weighty a burthen he hath received, and unto Whom he must give an
   account of his stewardship. Let him also know that it is more becoming
   in him to do good unto others, than to hold sway over them. He must
   therefore be learned in the Divine Law, that he may know whence to
   "bring forth new things and old;" [198] he must be chaste, sober, and
   merciful, and always prefer mercy to justice, that he himself may
   obtain mercy. He shall hate vice, and love the Brethren. Even in his
   corrections he shall act with prudence, and be guilty of no excess,
   lest, while too eagerly scouring off the rust, the vessel itself be
   broken. Let him bear in mind his own frailty, and remember that "the
   bruised reed must not be broken." [199]

   By this, we do not mean that he should allow vices to grow up, but, as
   we have said before, with prudence and charity, seek to root them out
   in such a way as shall be expedient for each case; and let his aim be
   rather to excite love, than to inspire fear. He must not be truculent
   and anxious; neither let him be over exacting, not headstrong, nor
   jealous, nor over suspicious, for then he will never be at rest. Even
   in what he orders, whether it pertain to God or to temporal matters,
   let him be prudent and considerate. Let him be discreet and moderate in
   the works which he enjoins, bearing in mind the discretion of holy
   Jacob who said; "If I shall cause my flocks to be overdriven, they will
   all die in one day." [200] Therefore adopting these and the like
   principles of discretion, which is the mother of all virtues, let him
   so temper all things that the strong may have somewhat to strive after,
   and the weak, nought from which they may flee away. Especially let him
   observe this present Rule in all things, that after having ministered
   well, he may hear from the Lord what the good servant heard, who gave
   corn to his fellow servants in due time; "Amen, I say unto you, over
   all his goods will he place him." [201]

  CHAPTER LXV.

   Of the Provost of the Monastery.

   It often happens that by the appointment of a Provost [202] great
   scandals arise in Monasteries; because some, so appointed, being puffed
   up with the malignant spirit of pride, and esteeming themselves to be
   second Abbots, take upon themselves to tyrannise over others, to foster
   scandals, and to promote dissensions in the Community; and especially
   in those places where the Provost is instituted by the same Bishops of
   Abbots as the Abbot himself. How foolish this custom is, may easily be
   perceived; for a handle for pride is given to the Provost from the very
   beginning of his appointment, because his thoughts suggest to him that
   he is now released from the power of his Abbot, since he is instituted
   by the very persons by whom the Abbot himself is instituted. Hence
   arise envy, quarrels, detractions, rivalries, dissensions, and
   disorders; and while the Abbot and Provost are at variance with each
   other, it must of necessity follow, that their souls are imperilled
   during this dissension; those also who are under their charge run to
   destruction by adhering, some to one side, and some to the other. The
   sin of this danger lieth principally upon those who were the authors of
   such an appointment.

   Therefore, we foresee that it is expedient for the preservation of
   peace and charity, that the entire government of the Monastery depend
   upon the will of the Abbot. As we have before arranged, let all the
   business of the Monastery be transacted, if possible, by the Deans,
   according as the Abbot shall have determined, in order that, many being
   sharers in the same office, no one may become proud.

   But if either the circumstances of the place require a Provost, or the
   Community with reason and humility ask for one, and the Abbot think it
   expedient, he shall with the advice of such of the Brethren as have the
   fear of God before them, nominate and appoint one himself. Let the
   Provost do with reverence what shall be enjoined him by the Abbot, in
   no way going against his will or ordinance; because the higher he is
   advanced above the rest, the more carefully ought he to observe all the
   precepts of the Rule. If the Provost be found viciously inclined, or
   deceived by the haughtiness of pride, or a contemner of the Holy Rule,
   let him be warned by word of mouth four times; if he do not amend, let
   the correction of regular discipline be applied to him. If with this he
   do not grow better, he shall be deposed from the dignity of the
   Provostship, and a worthier man put in his place. If after this he be
   not quiet and obedient in the Community, let him be expelled from the
   Monastery. The Abbot shall nevertheless bear in mind, that for all his
   judgments he shall have to give an account to God, lest perchance his
   soul burn with the flame of envy and jealousy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prior synonymously..
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVI.

   Of the porter of the Monastery.

   At the gate of the Monastery, let there be stationed a wise old man,
   who knows how to receive and to give an answer, and whose ripeness of
   age will not suffer him to wander from his post. He ought to have a
   cell near the gate, that such as come may always find him at hand,
   ready to give them an answer.

   As soon as any one shall knock, or a poor man cry for aid, let him
   presently answer: "Thanks be to God," or invoke a blessing; and with
   all mildness of the fear of God, let him reply speedily in the fervour
   of charity. If he need help, he shall have a junior Brother with him.
   The Monastery ought, if possible, to be so constructed as to contain
   within itself all necessaries, that is, water, a mill, a garden, and a
   bakehouse; also that the various crafts be exercised within it, so that
   there be no occasion for Monks to go abroad, because it is in no wise
   expedient for their souls. We wish this rule to be frequently read in
   the Community, that no Brother may excuse himself on the score of
   ignorance.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVII.

   Of brethren who are sent on a journey.

   Let those who are to be sent on a journey commend themselves to the
   prayers of all the Brethren and of the Abbot, and always at the last
   prayer of the Work of God let a commemoration be made of all the
   absent. When they come back, they shall, on the very day of their
   return, lie prostrate on the ground of the Oratory during all the
   Canonical Hours, while the Work of God is being fulfilled, and beg the
   prayers of all, on account of the faults they may have committed on the
   way, by sight or hearing of evil things, or by idle discourse. Let no
   one presume to relate unto others what he has seen or heard outside the
   Monastery; because this is a fruitful source of evil. If any one shall
   presume to do so, let him be liable to the penalty prescribed by the
   Rule. In like manner shall he be punished who shall presume to break
   the enclosure of the Monastery, or go anywhere, or do anything, how
   trifling soever without leave of the Abbot.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXVIII.

   If a Brother be ordered to do impossibilities.

   If any hard or impossible commands be enjoined a Brother, let him
   receive the injunctions of him who biddeth him with all mildness and
   obedience. But if he shall see that the burthen altogether exceedeth
   the measure of his strength, let him patiently and in due season state
   the cause of this inability unto his Superior, without manifesting any
   pride, resistance, or contradiction. If after his suggestion, the Prior
   shall still persist in his command, let the Brother know that it is for
   his good, and trusting in the assistance of God, let him obey through
   love for Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXIX.

   That no one presume to defend another in the Monastery.

   Special care must be taken, that on no occasion one Monk presume to
   uphold or defend another in the Monastery, even though they be very
   near of kin. In no way whatsoever let any Monk presume to do this,
   because exceeding great occasion of scandal may arise from thence. If
   anyone shall transgress in this point, let him be severely punished.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXX.

   That no one presume to strike another.

   Let every occasion of presumption be avoided in the Monastery. We
   ordain and decree, that no one, unless the Abbot hath given his
   authority, shall be allowed to excommunicate or to strike any of his
   Brethren. Such as trespass in this respect shall be reprehended in the
   presence of all, that the rest may be inspired with fear. But let all
   have strict discipline and care over children, until their fifteenth
   year; yet this also must be done with moderation and discretion. For he
   who shall, without the Abbot's leave, presume to chastise such as are
   above that age, or to be unduly severe even towards the children, shall
   be liable to regular discipline, because it is written: "What thou
   wouldst not have done to thyself, do not thou unto another." [203]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [203] Tob. iv. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXI.

   That the brethren be obedient to each other.

   The service of obedience by all is not to be rendered to the Abbot
   only, but the Brethren shall also mutually obey each other, knowing
   that by this path of obedience they shall to unto God. Therefore, when
   the command of the Abbot, or of other Superiors constituted by him,
   have been first obeyed, (to which we suffer no private orders to be
   preferred), the Juniors shall obey their Seniors with all charity and
   diligence. If anyone be found contentious, let him be rebuked.

   But if a Brother be rebuked for event he least thing by the Abbot, or
   by any of his Seniors; or if he shall perceive that the mind of his
   Senior is even slightly, be it never so little, moved against him, he
   shall, without delay, prostrate himself at his feet, and remain there
   till that commotion be appeased and he receive a blessing. If any one
   be too proud to do this, let him be liable either to corporal
   punishment, or if he prove contumacious, let him be expelled from the
   Monastery.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER LXXII.

   Of the good zeal which Monks ought to have.

   As there is an evil zeal of bitterness which separateth from God, and
   leadeth to hell, so there is a good zeal, which separateth from vices
   and leadeth to God and life everlasting. Let Monks, therefore, exercise
   this zeal with most fervent love; that is to say, let them "in honour
   prevent one another." [204] Let them bear patiently with each other's
   infirmities, whether of body or of mind. Let them contend with one
   another in the virtue of obedience. Let no one follow what he thinketh
   profitable to himself, but rather that which is profitable to another;
   let them show unto each other all brotherly charity with a chaste love.
   Let them fear God, love their Abbot with sincere and humble affection,
   and prefer nothing whatever to Christ, and may He bring us to life
   everlasting. Amen.

  CHAPTER LXXIII.

   That the whole observance of perfection is not contained in this Rule.

   We have written this Rule, that by its observance in Monasteries we may
   show that we possess, in some measure, uprightness of manners, or the
   beginning of a good Religious life. But for such as hasten forward to
   the perfection of holy living, there are the precepts of the holy
   Fathers, the observance whereof leadeth a man to the height of
   perfection. For what page, or what passage is there in the divinely
   inspired books of the Old and New Testament, that is not a most perfect
   rule of man's life? Or what book is there of the holy Catholic Fathers
   that doth not proclaim this; that we may by a direct course reach our
   Creator? Moreover, what else are the Collations of the Fathers, their
   Institutes, their Lives, also the Rule of our Holy Father Basil, but
   examples of the good living and obedience of Monks, and so many
   instruments of virtue? But to us who are slothful and lead bad and
   negligent lives, they are matter for shame and confusion.

   Therefore whosoever thou art that dost hasten to the heavenly country,
   first accomplish, by the help of Christ, this little Rule written for
   beginners: and then at length thou shalt come, under the guidance of
   God, to those loftier heights of doctrine and of virtue, which we have
