                                  Introduction

   The documents contained herein are foundational to basic Christian
   doctrine and are, for the most part, claimed across denominational
   boundaries. These classic documents are not simply of historical value,
   but they are immensely valuable for believers today to read, consider,
   and understand. They deal in real terms with what it means to live as a
   Christian. They struggle to quantify complex and confusing ideas in
   clear, undeniable terminology.

   Hopefully the reader will find this to be a valuable resource. There is
   very little explanatory matter, as the creeds and confessions speak
   quite well for themselves.

                                Apostles' Creed

   Philip Schaff, in his Creeds of Christendom, writes of the Apostles'
   Creed, "As the Lord's Prayer is the Prayer of prayers, the Decalogue is
   the Law of laws, so the Apostles' Creed is the Creed of creeds. It
   contains all the fundamental articles of the Christian faith necessary
   to salvation, in the form of facts, in simple Scripture language, and
   in the most natural order--the order of revelation--from God and the
   creation down to the resurrection and life everlasting." [1] The simple
   doctrinal statements within this creed are clear and concise, and their
   meaning cannot be misconstrued.


   I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth

   And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord

   Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary

   Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead and buried; He
   descended into hell

   The third day he rose again from the dead

   He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father
   Almighty

   From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead

   I believe in the Holy Ghost

   I believe a holy catholic church; the communion of saints

   The forgiveness of sins

   The resurrection of the body

   And the life everlasting. Amen.

                                  Nicene Creed

   The Nicene Creed was originally the result of the Council of Nicea in
   325 a.d. While there are similarities between the text of the Nicene
   Creed and the text of the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, according
   to Schaff, is "more definite and explicit than the Apostles' Creed in
   the statement of the divinity of Christ and the Holy Ghost." [2] The
   Nicene Creed provided the needed clarification to combat the heresies
   of the Nicene age, and is useful to combat those same heresies today
   which invariably reoccur in differing forms.

   I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,
   and of all things visible and invisible.

   And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of
   the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of
   very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father,
   by whom all things were made.

   Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was
   incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and
   was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was
   buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures;
   and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and
   He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose
   kingdom shall have no end.

   And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who
   proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son
   together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.

   And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one
   baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of
   the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

                                Athanasian Creed

   The Athanasian Creed is noted for its strong focus on the doctrine of
   the Trinity. Schaff notes that "the Athanasian Creed, in strong
   contrast with the uncontroversial and peaceful tone of the Apostles'
   Creed, begins and ends with the solemn declaration that the catholic
   faith in the Trinity and the Incarnation herein set forth is the
   indispensable condition of salvation, and that those who reject it will
   be lost forever." [3]

   Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold
   the catholic faith; Which faith except every one do keep whole and
   undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

   And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and
   Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the
   substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son,
   and another of the Holy Spirit.

   But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is
   all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is,
   such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit. The Father uncreated, the
   Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated. The Father
   incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit
   incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy
   Spirit eternal. And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal. As
   also there are not three untreated nor three incomprehensible, but one
   untreated and one incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is almighty,
   the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty. And yet they are not
   three almighties, but one almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is
   God, and the Holy Spirit is God; And yet they are not three Gods, but
   one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy
   Spirit Lord; And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord. For like as
   we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by
   himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the catholic
   religion to say; There are three Gods or three Lords. The Father is
   made of none, neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father
   alone; not made nor created, but begotten. The Holy Spirit is of the
   Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but
   proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not
   three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits. And in this
   Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or less than
   another. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal. So
   that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity
   in Unity is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved must thus
   think of the Trinity.

   Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also
   believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right
   faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, is God and man. God of the substance of the Father,
   begotten before the worlds; and man of substance of His mother, born in
   the world. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human
   flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and
   inferior to the Father as touching His manhood. Who, although He is God
   and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ. One, not by conversion of
   the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of that manhood into God. One
   altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For
   as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one
   Christ; Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again
   the third day from the dead; He ascended into heaven, He sits on the
   right hand of the Father, God, Almighty; From thence He shall come to
   judge the quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again
   with their bodies; and shall give account of their own works. And they
   that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they that have
   done evil into everlasting fire.

   This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he
   cannot be saved.

                            The Heidelberg Catechism

   The catechism was composed at the request of Elector Frederick III for
   the purpose of instructing the youth of the day, and guiding pastors
   and teachers in their teaching duties. Of the Heidelberg Catechism,
   Schaff writes, "The Catechism is a work of religious enthusiasm, based
   on solid theological learning, and directed by excellent judgement....
   It is the product of the heart as well as the head, full of faith and
   unction from above. It is fresh, lively, glowing, yet clear, sober,
   self-sustained. The ideas are Biblical and orthodox, and well fortified
   by apt Scripture proofs. The language is dignified, terse, nervous,
   popular, and often truly eloquent. It is the language of devotion as
   well as instruction. Altogether the Heidelberg Catechism is more than a
   book, it is an institution, and will live as long as the Reformed
   Church." [4]

    Question 1

   What is thy only comfort in life and death?

   That I with body and soul, both in life and death, [5] am not my own,
   [6] but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; [7] who, with his
   precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, [8] and delivered
   me from all the power of the devil; [9] and so preserves me [10] that
   without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my
   head; [11] yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation,
   [12] and therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also assures me of eternal
   life, [13] and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to
   live unto him. [14]

    Question 3

   Whence knowest thou thy misery?

   [19] Rom. 3:20.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 4

   What does the law of God require of us?

   Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, "Thou shalt love the
   Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and the great
   commandment; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and
   the prophets." [20]

    Question 5

   Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?

   In no wise; [21] for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 6

   Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?

   By no means; but God created man good, [23] and after his own image,
   [24] in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God
   his Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness
   to glorify and praise him. [25]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 7

   Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?

   From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in
   Paradise; [26] hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all
   conceived and born in sin. [27]

    Question 8

   Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good,
   and inclined to all wickedness?

   Indeed we are; [28] except we are regenerated by the Spirit of God.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 9

   Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his
   law, that which he cannot perform?

   Not at all; [30] for God made man capable of performing it; but man, by
   the instigation of the devil, [31] and his own wilful disobedience,
   [32] deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 10

   Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?

   By no means; but is terribly displeased [33] with our original as well
   as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally
   and eternally, [34] as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law,
   to do them." [35]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 11

   Is not God then also merciful?

   God is indeed merciful, [36] but also just; [37] therefore his justice
   requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of
   God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting
   punishment of body and soul.

    Question 12

   Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and
   eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that
   punishment, and be again received into favour?

   God will have his justice satisfied: [38] and therefore we must make
   this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another. [39]

   [39] Rom. 8:3, 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 13

   Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?

   By no means; but on the contrary we daily increase our debt. [40]

   Matt. 18:25; Matt. 16:26.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 14

   Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to
   satisfy for us?

   None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin
   which man has committed; [41] and further, no mere creature can sustain
   the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others
   from it. [42]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 15

   What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?

   For one who is very man, and perfectly [43] righteous; [44] and yet
   more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Lord's Day 6
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 16

   Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?

   Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which
   has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; [46] and one,
   who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others. [47]
     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 17

   Why must he in one person be also very God?

   That he might, by the power of his Godhead [48] sustain in his human
   nature, [49] the burden of God's wrath; [50] and might obtain for, and
   restore to us, righteousness and life. [51]

   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." [56]

   all that God has revealed to us in his word, [64] but also an assured
   confidence, [65] which the Holy Ghost [66] works by the gospel in my
   heart; [67] that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin,
   everlasting righteousness and salvation, [68] are freely given by God,
   merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits. [69]

   heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty: 7.
   From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead: 8. I believe
   in the Holy Ghost: 9. I believe a holy catholic church: the communion

    Question 25

   Since there is but one only divine essence, [71] why speakest thou of

    Question 26

   What believest thou when thou sayest, "I believe in God the Father,
   Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth"?

   That the eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (who of nothing made
   heaven and earth, with all that is in them; [73] who likewise upholds
   and governs the same by his eternal counsel and providence) [74] is for
   the sake of Christ his Son, my God and my Father; [75] on whom I rely
   so entirely, that I have no doubt, but he will provide me with all
   things necessary for soul and body [76] and further, that he will make
   whatever evils he sends upon me, in this valley of tears turn out to my
   advantage; [77] for he is able to do it, being Almighty God, [78] and
   willing, being a faithful Father. [79]

    Question 27

   What dost thou mean by the providence of God?

   The almighty and everywhere present power of God; [80] whereby, as it
   were by his hand, he upholds and governs [81] heaven, earth, and all
   creatures; so that herbs and grass, rain and drought, [82] fruitful and

   That we may be patient in adversity; [86] thankful in prosperity; [87]
   and that in all things, which may hereafter befall us, we place our
   firm trust in our faithful God and Father, [88] that nothing shall
   separate us from his love; [89] since all creatures are so in his hand,
   that without his will they cannot so much as move. [90]

    Question 29

   Why is the Son of God called "Jesus", that is a Saviour?

   Because he saveth us, and delivereth us from our sins; [91] and
   likewise, because we ought not to seek, neither can find salvation in
   any other. [92]

    Question 30

   Do such then believe in Jesus the only Saviour, who seek their
   salvation and welfare of saints, of themselves, or anywhere else?

   They do not; for though they boast of him in words, yet in deeds they
   deny Jesus the only deliverer and Saviour; [93] for one of these two
   things must be true, that either Jesus is not a complete Saviour; or
   that they, who by a true faith receive this Saviour, must find all
   things in him necessary to their salvation. [94]

   Why is he called "Christ", that is anointed?

   Because he is ordained of God the Father, and anointed with the Holy
   Ghost, [95] to be our chief Prophet and Teacher, [96] who has fully
   revealed to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our
   redemption; [97] and to be our only High Priest, [98] who by the one
   sacrifice of his body, has redeemed us, [99] and makes continual
   intercession with the Father for us; [100] and also to be our eternal
   King, who governs us by his word and Spirit, and who defends and
   preserves us in that salvation, he has purchased for us. [101]

    Question 32

   But why art thou called a Christian? [102]

   Because I am a member of Christ by faith, [103] and thus am partaker of

   myself a living sacrifice of thankfulness to him: [106] and also that
   with a free and good conscience I may fight against sin and Satan in
   this life [107] and afterwards I reign with him eternally, over all

   Why is Christ called the "only begotten Son" of God, since we are also

    Question 34

   Wherefore callest thou him "our Lord"?

   What is the meaning of these words "He was conceived by the Holy Ghost,

   That God's eternal Son, who is, and continues [112] true and eternal
   God, [113] took upon him the very nature of man, of the flesh and blood
   of the virgin Mary, [114] by the operation of the Holy Ghost; [115]

    Question 37

   What dost thou understand by the words, "He suffered"?

   That he, all the time that he lived on earth, but especially at the end
   of his life, sustained in body and soul, the wrath of God against the
   sins of all mankind: [121] that so by his passion, as the only
   propitiatory sacrifice, [122] he might redeem our body and soul from

    Question 38

   Why did he suffer "under Pontius Pilate, as judge"?

   That he, being innocent, and yet condemned by a temporal judge, [125]
   might thereby free us from the severe judgement of God to which we were
   exposed. [126]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 39

   Is there anything more in his being "crucified", than if he had died
   some other death?

   Yes there is; for thereby I am assured, that he took on him the curse
   which lay upon me; [127] for the death of the cross was accursed of
   God. [128]

    Question 40

   Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself even "unto death"?

   Because with respect to the justice and truth of God, [129]

    Question 42

   Since then Christ died for us, why must we also die?

   Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, [132] but only an

    Question 43

   What further benefit do we receive from the sacrifice and death of
   Christ on the cross?

   That by virtue thereof, our old man is crucified, dead and buried with
   him; [134] that so the corrupt inclinations of the flesh may no more
   reign in us; [135] but that we may offer ourselves unto him a sacrifice

   How dost thou understand these words, "he ascended into heaven"?

   That Christ, in sight of his disciples, was taken up from earth into

   he comes again to judge the quick and the dead. [144]

    Question 47

   Is not Christ then with us even to the end of the world, as he has
   promised? [145]

   Christ is very man and very God; with respect to his human nature, he

   grace and spirit, he is at no time absent from us. [147]

    Question 48

   But if his human nature is not present, wherever his Godhead is, are
   not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?

   Not as all, for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent, [148]
   it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the
   human nature he assumed, [149] and yet is nevertheless in this human
   nature, and remains personally united to it.

    Question 49

   Of what advantage to us is Christ's ascension into heaven?

   First, that he is our advocate in the presence of his Father in heaven;
   [150] secondly, that we have our flesh in heaven as a sure pledge that
   he, as the head, will also take up to himself, us, his members; [151]

   appear as head of his church, [154] by whom the Father governs all
   things. [155]

   That not only my soul after this life shall be immediately taken up to

   to all evil; [187] notwithstanding, God, without any merit of mine,

   perfect satisfaction, [191] righteousness and holiness of Christ; [192]
   even so, as if I never had had, nor committed any sin: yea, as if I had
   fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ has accomplished for
   me; [193] inasmuch as I embrace such benefit with a believing heart.

    Question 65

   Since then we are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by

    Question 66

   What are the sacraments?

   The sacraments are holy visible signs and seals, appointed of God for
   this end, that by the use thereof, he may the more fully declare and
   seal to us the promise of the gospel, viz., that he grants us freely
   the remission of sin, and life eternal, for the sake of that one
   sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross. [203]

    Question 67

   Are both word and sacraments, then, ordained and appointed for this

   Yes, indeed: for the Holy Ghost teaches us in the gospel, and assures
   us by the sacraments, that the whole of our salvation depends upon that
   one sacrifice of Christ which he offered for us on the cross.

   How art thou admonished and assured by holy baptism, that the one

   Thus: That Christ appointed this external washing with water, [205]
   adding thereto this promise, [206] that I am as certainly washed by his
   blood and Spirit from all the pollution of my soul, that is, from all
   my sins, [207] as I am washed externally with water, by which the
   filthiness of the body is commonly washed away.

    Question 70

   What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?

   It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely, for the sake of
   Christ's blood, which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross;
   [208] and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be
   members of Christ, that so we may more and more die unto sin, and lead
   holy and unblamable lives. [209]

    Question 71

   Where has Christ promised us, that he will as certainly wash us by his
   blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?

   In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed: "Go ye,
   therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost", Matt. 28:19. And "he
   that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
   not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16. This promise is also repeated,
   where the scripture calls baptism "the washing of regenerations" and
   the washing away of sins. Tit. 3:5, Acts 22:16. [210]

    Question 72

   Is then the external baptism with water the washing away of sin itself?

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 73

   Why then does the Holy Ghost call baptism "the washing of
   regeneration," and "the washing away of sins"?

   God speaks thus not without great cause, to-wit, not only thereby to
   teach us, that as the filth of the body is purged away by water, so our
   sins are removed by the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; [213] but
   especially that by this divine pledge and sign he may assure us, that
   we are spiritually cleansed from our sins as really, as we are
   externally washed with water. [214]

    Question 74

   Are infants also to be baptized?

   Yes: for since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant
   and church of God; [215] and since redemption from sin [216] by the
   blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the author of faith, is promised
   to them no less than to the adult; [217] they must therefore by
   baptism, as a sign of the covenant, be also admitted into the christian
   church; and be distinguished from the children of unbelievers [218] as
   was done in the old covenant or testament by circumcision, [219]
   instead of which baptism is instituted [220] in the new covenant.

    Question 75

   How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper, that thou art
   a partaker of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross,
   and of all his benefits?

   Thus: That Christ has commanded me and all believers, to eat of this
   broken bread, and to drink of this cup, in remembrance of him, adding
   these promises: [221] first, that his body was offered and broken on
   the cross for me, and his blood shed for me, as certainly as I see with
   my eyes, the bread of the Lord broken for me, and the cup communicated
   to me; and further, that he feeds and nourishes my soul to everlasting
   life, with his crucified body and shed blood, as assuredly as I receive
   from the hands of the minister, and taste with my mouth the bread and
   cup of the Lord, as certain signs of the body and blood of Christ.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 76

   What is it then to eat the crucified body, and drink the shed blood of
   Christ?

   It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and
   death of Christ and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin, and life
   eternal; [222] but also, besides that, to become more and more united
   to his sacred body, [223] by the Holy Ghost, who dwells both in Christ
   and in us; so that we, though Christ is in heaven [224] and we on
   earth, are notwithstanding "flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone"
   [225] and that we live, and are governed forever by one spirit, [226]
   as members of the same body are by one soul.

    Question 77

   Where has Christ promised that he will as certainly feed and nourish
   believers with his body and bleed, as they eat of this broken bread,
   and drink of this cup?

   In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: [227] "The
   Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and
   when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said: eat, this is my body,
   which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the same
   manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying: this cup is
   the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in
   remembrance of me. For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this
   cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come." 1 Cor. 11:23-26. This
   promise is repeated by the holy apostle Paul, where he says "The cup of
   blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
   Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body
   of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread." 1 Cor. 10:16, 17.

    Question 78

   Do then the bread and wine become the very body and blood of Christ?

   Not at all: [228] but as the water in baptism is not changed into the
   blood of Christ, neither is the washing away of sin itself, being only
   the sign and confirmation thereof appointed of God; [229] so the bread
   in the Lord's supper is not changed into the very body of Christ; [230]
   though agreeably to the nature and properties of sacraments, [231] it
   is called the body of Christ Jesus.

    Question 79

   Why then doth Christ call the bread "his body", and the cup "his
   blood", or "the new covenant in his blood"; and Paul the "communion of
   body and blood of Christ"?

   Christ speaks thus, not without great reason, namely, not only thereby
   to teach us, that as bread and wine support this temporal life, so his
   crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and drink, whereby our
   souls are fed to eternal life; [232] but more especially by these
   visible signs and pledges to assure us, that we are as really partakers
   of his true body and blood by the operation of the Holy Ghost as we
   receive by the mouths of our bodies these holy signs in remembrance of
   him; [233] and that all his sufferings and obedience are as certainly
   ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction
   for our sins to God.

    Question 80

   What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the popish mass?

   The Lord's supper testifies to us, that we have a full pardon of all
   sin by the only sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which he himself has once
   accomplished on the cross; [234] and, that we by the Holy Ghost are
   ingrafted into Christ, [235] who, according to his human nature is now
   not on earth, but in heaven, at the right hand of God his Father, [236]
   and will there be worshipped by us. [237] But the mass teaches, that
   the living and dead have not the pardon of sins through the sufferings
   of Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them by the priests;
   and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and wine,
   and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at bottom,
   is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of
   Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry. [238]

    Question 81

   For whom is the Lord's supper instituted?

   For those who are truly sorrowful for their sins, and yet trust that
   these are forgiven them for the sake of Christ; and that their
   remaining infirmities are covered by his passion and death; and who
   also earnestly desire to have their faith more and more strengthened,
   and their lives more holy; but hypocrites, and such as turn not to God
   with sincere hearts, eat and drink judgment to themselves. [239]

    Question 82

   Are they also to be admitted to this supper, who, by confession and
   life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly?

   No; for by this, the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath
   kindled against the whole congregation; [240] therefore it is the duty
   of the christian church, according to the appointment of Christ and his
   apostles, to exclude such persons, by the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven, till they show amendment of life.

    Question 83

   What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?

   The preaching of the holy gospel, and christian discipline, or
   excommunication out of the christian church; by these two, the kingdom
   of heaven is opened to believers, and shut against unbelievers.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 84

   How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of the
   holy gospel?

   Thus: when according to the command of Christ, it is declared and
   publicly testified to all and every believer, that, whenever they
   receive the promise of the gospel by a true faith, all their sins are
   really forgiven them of God, for the sake of Christ's merits; and on
   the contrary, when it is declared and testified to all unbelievers, and
   such as do not sincerely repent, that they stand exposed to the wrath
   of God, and eternal condemnation, so long as they are unconverted:
   [241] according to which testimony of the gospel, God will judge them,
   both in this, and in the life to come.

    Question 85

   How is the kingdom of heaven shut and opened by christian discipline?

   Thus: when according to the command of Christ, those, who under the
   name of christians, maintain doctrines, or practices inconsistent
   therewith, and will not, after having been often brotherly admonished,
   renounce their errors and wicked course of life, are complained of to
   the church, or to those, who are thereunto appointed by the church; and
   if they despise their admonition, are by them forbidden the use of the
   sacraments; whereby they are excluded from the christian church, and by
   God himself from the kingdom of Christ; and when they promise and show
   real amendment, are again received as members of Christ and his church.

    Question 86

   Since then we are delivered from our misery, merely of grace, through
   Christ, without any merit of ours, why must we still do good works?

   Because Christ, having redeemed and delivered us by his blood, also
   renews us by his Holy Spirit, after his own image; that so we may
   testify, by the whole of our conduct, our gratitude to God for his
   blessings, [243] and that he may be praised by us; [244] also, that
   every one may be assured in himself of his faith, [245] by the fruits
   thereof; and that, by our godly conversation others may be gained to
   Christ. [246]

    Question 92

   What is the law of God?

   God spake all these words, Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21,
   saying: I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
   of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

   1st commandment: Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

   2nd commandment: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
   likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
   beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow
   down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the LORD thy God am a
   jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
   unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shewing
   mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

   3rd commandment: Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in
   vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
   vain.

   4th commandment: Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days
   shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the
   sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
   nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor
   thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days
   the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
   rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and
   hallowed it.

   5th commandment: Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be
   long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

   6th commandment: Thou shalt not kill.

   7th commandment: Thou shalt not commit adultery.

   8th commandment: Thou shalt not steal.

   9th commandment: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
   neighbour.

   10th commandment: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou
   shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
   maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy
   neighbour's.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 93

   How are these commandments divided?

   Into two tables; [256] the first of which teaches us how we must behave
   towards God; the second, what duties we owe to our neighbour. [257]

    Question 94

   What does God enjoin in the first commandment?

   That I, as sincerely as I desire the salvation of my own soul, avoid
   and flee from all idolatry, [258] sorcery, soothsaying, superstition,
   [259] invocation of saints, or any other creatures; [260] and learn
   rightly to know the only true God; [261] trust in him alone, [262] with
   humility [263] and patience submit to him; [264] expect all good things
   from him only; [265] love, [266] fear, [267] and glorify him with my
   whole heart; [268] so that I renounce and forsake all creatures, rather
   than commit even the least thing contrary to his will. [269]

   What is required in the third commandment?

   That we, not only by cursing [277] or perjury, [278] but also by rash
   swearing, [279] must not profane or abuse the name of God; nor by
   silence or connivance be partakers of these horrible sins in others;
   [280] and, briefly, that we use the holy name of God no otherwise than
   with fear and reverence; [281] so that he may be rightly confessed

    Question 100

   Is then the profaning of God's name, by swearing and cursing, so
   heinous a sin, that his wrath is kindled against those who do not
   endeavour, as much as in them lies, to prevent and forbid such cursing
   and swearing?

   It undoubtedly is, [285] for there is no sin greater or more provoking
   to God, than the profaning of his name; and therefore he has commanded
   this sin to be punished with death. [286]

    Question 101

   May we then swear religiously by the name of God?

   Yes: either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when
   necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the
   glory of God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is
   founded on God's word, [287] and therefore was justly used by the

   swear falsely; [289] which honour is due to no creature. [290]

   [293] to use the sacraments, [294] publicly to call upon the Lord,
   [295] and contribute to the relief of the poor. [296] Secondly, that

   That neither in thoughts, nor words, nor gestures, much less in deeds,

    Question 106

   But this commandment seems only to speak of murder?

   In forbidding murder, God teaches us, that he abhors the causes

   revenge; and that he accounts all these as murder. [308]

   love our neighbour as ourselves; [309] to show patience, peace,
   meekness, mercy, and all kindness, towards him, [310] and prevent his
   hurt as much as in us lies; [311] and that we do good, even to our

   temperately, [315] whether in holy wedlock, or in single life. [316]

    Question 109

   Does God forbid in this commandment, only adultery, and such like gross
   sins?

   Since both our body and soul are temples of the holy Ghost, he commands
   us to preserve them pure and holy: therefore he forbids all unchaste
   actions, gestures, words, [317] thoughts, desires, [318] and whatever
   can entice men thereto. [319]

    Question 110

   What does God forbid in the eighth commandment?

   God forbids not only those thefts, [320] and robberies, [321] which are
   punishable by the magistrate; but he comprehends under the name of
   theft all wicked tricks and devices, whereby we design to appropriate
   to ourselves the goods which belong to our neighbour: [322] whether it
   be by force, or under the appearance of right, as by unjust weights,
   ells, measures, fraudulent merchandise, [323] false coins, usury, [324]
   or by any other way forbidden by God; as also all covetousness, [325]
   all abuse and waste of his gifts. [326]

   that I avoid all sorts of lies and deceit, as the proper works of the
   devil, [333] unless I would bring down upon me the heavy wrath of God;
   [334] likewise, that in judgment and all other dealings I love the
   truth, speak it uprightly and confess it; [335] also that I defend and

    Question 113

   What does the tenth commandment require of us?

   That even the smallest inclination or thought, contrary to any of God's
   commandments, never rise in our hearts; but that at all times we hate
   all sin with our whole heart, and delight in all righteousness. [337]

   commandments?

   No: but even the holiest men, while in this life, have only a small
   beginning of this obedience; [338] yet so, that with a sincere
   resolution they begin to live, not only according to some, but all the
   commandments of God. [339]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Question 115

   Why will God then have the ten commandments so strictly preached, since
   no man in this life can keep them?

   First, that all our lifetime we may learn more and more to know [340]
   our sinful nature, and thus become the more earnest in seeking the
   remission of sin, and righteousness in Christ; [341] likewise, that we
   constantly endeavour and pray to God for the grace of the Holy Spirit,
   that we may become more and more conformable to the image of God, till
   we arrive at the perfection proposed to us, in a life to come. [342]

    Question 116

   Why is prayer necessary for christians?

   Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us:
   [343] and also, because God will give his grace and Holy Spirit to
   those only, who with sincere desires continually ask them of him, and
   are thankful for them. [344]

    Question 117

   What are the requisites of that prayer, which is acceptable to God, and
   which he will hear?

   First, that we from the heart pray [345] to the one true God only, who
   has manifested himself in his word, [346] for all things, he has
   commanded us to ask of him; [347] secondly, that we rightly and
   thoroughly know our need and misery, [348] that so we may deeply humble
   ourselves in the presence of his divine majesty; [349] thirdly, that we
   be fully persuaded that he, notwithstanding that we are unworthy of it,
   will, for the sake of Christ our Lord, certainly hear our prayer, [350]
   as he has promised us in his word. [351]

    Question 120

   Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: "Our Father"?

   That immediately, in the very beginning of our prayer, he might excite

   foundation of our prayer: namely, that God is become our Father in
   Christ, and will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith,

                              The Canons of Dordt

   In 1610, the Armenians prepared a document, comprised of five articles,
   known as the Remonstrance. This Remonstrance was the source of much
   controversy, and as such, the National Synod of Dordt was convened in
   1618 to examine the problem and arrive at a resolution. The Canons of
   Dordt are the outcome of the Synod of Dordt, and the outcome was
   thoroughly against Armenian doctrine. The structure of the Canons of
   Dordt is similar to the Remonstrance, laid out in five articles, each
   rebutting one of the five articles of the Remonstrance. Of the Canons,
   Schaff writes, "The Canons of Dordt have for Calvinism the same
   significance which the Formula of Concord has for Lutheranism. Both
   betray a very high order of theological ability and care. Both are
   consistent and necessary developments. Both exerted a powerful
   conservative influence on these Churches." [384]
     __________________________________________________________________

First Head of Doctrine

Divine Election and Reprobation
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 1

   As all men have sinned in Adam, lie under the curse, and are deserving
   of eternal death, God would have done no injustice by leaving them all
   to perish and delivering them over to condemnation on account of sin,
   according to the words of the apostle: That every mouth may be stopped,
   and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God (Rom. 3:19).
   And: For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God (Rom.
   3:23). And: For the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 2

   But in this the love of God was manifested, that He sent his only
   begotten Son into the world, that whosoever believeth on him should not
   perish, but have eternal life (1 John 4:9; John 3:16).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 3

   And that men may be brought to believe, God mercifully sends the
   messengers of these most joyful tidings to whom He will and at what
   time He pleases; by whose ministry men are called to repentance and
   faith in Christ crucified. How then shall they call on him in whom they
   have not believed? And how shall they believe in him whom they have not
   heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they
   preach except they be sent? (Rom. 10:14, 15).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 4

   The wrath of God abides upon those who believe not this gospel. But
   such as receive it and embrace Jesus the Savior by a true and living
   faith are by Him delivered from the wrath of God and from destruction,
   and have the gift of eternal life conferred upon them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 5

   The cause or guilt of this unbelief as well as of all other sins is no
   wise in God, but in man himself; whereas faith in Jesus Christ and
   salvation through Him is the free gift of God, as it is written: By
   grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it
   is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8). Likewise: To you it hath been granted in
   the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, etc. (Phil. 1:29).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 6

   That some receive the gift of faith from God, and others do not receive
   it, proceeds from Gods eternal decree. For known unto God are all his
   works from the beginning of the world (Acts 15:18, A.V.). Who worketh
   all things after the counsel of his will (Eph. 1:11). According to
   which decree He graciously softens the hearts of the elect, however
   obstinate, and inclines them to believe; while He leaves the non- elect
   in His just judgment to their own wickedness and obduracy. And herein
   is especially displayed the profound, the merciful, and at the same
   time the righteous discrimination between men equally involved in ruin;
   or that decree of election and reprobation, revealed in the Word of
   God, which, though men of perverse, impure, and unstable minds wrest it
   to their own destruction, yet to holy and pious souls affords
   unspeakable consolation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 7

   Election is the unchangeable purpose of God, whereby, before the
   foundation of the world, He has out of mere grace, according to the
   sovereign good pleasure of His own will, chosen from the whole human
   race, which had fallen through their own fault from their primitive
   state of rectitude into sin and destruction, a certain number of
   persons to redemption in Christ, whom He from eternity appointed the
   Mediator and Head of the elect and the foundation of salvation. This
   elect number, though by nature neither better nor more deserving than
   others, but with them involved in one common misery, God has decreed to
   give to Christ to be saved by Him, and effectually to call and draw
   them to His communion by His Word and Spirit; to bestow upon them true
   faith, justification, and sanctification; and having powerfully
   preserved them in the fellowship of His Son, finally to glorify them
   for the demonstration of His mercy, and for the praise of the riches of
   His glorious grace; as it is written: Even as he chose us in him before
   the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish
   before him in love: having foreordained us unto adoption as sons
   through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of
   his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely
   bestowed on us in the Beloved (Eph. 1:4, 5, 6). And elsewhere: Whom he
   foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Rom. 8:30).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 8

   There are not various decrees of election, but one and the same decree
   respecting all those who shall be saved, both under the Old and the New
   Testament; since the Scripture declares the good pleasure, purpose, and
   counsel of the divine will to be one, according to which He has chosen
   us from eternity, both to grace and to glory, to salvation and to the
   way of salvation, which He has ordained that we should walk therein (
   Eph. 1:4, 5; 2:10).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 9

   This election was not founded upon foreseen faith and the obedience of
   faith, holiness, or any other good quality or disposition in man, as
   the prerequisite, cause, or condition on which it depended; but men are
   chosen to faith and to the obedience of faith, holiness, etc. Therefore
   election is the fountain of every saving good, from which proceed
   faith, holiness, and the other gifts of salvation, and finally eternal
   life itself, as its fruits and effects, according to the testimony of
   the apostle: He hath chosen us (not because we were, but) that we
   should be holy, and without blemish before him in love (Eph. 1:4).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 10

   The good pleasure of God is the sole cause of this gracious election;
   which does not consist herein that out of all possible qualities and
   actions of men God has chosen some as a condition of salvation, but
   that He was pleased out of the common mass of sinners to adopt some
   certain persons as a peculiar people to Himself, as it is written: For
   the children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or
   bad, etc., it was said unto her (namely, to Rebekah), The elder shall
   serve the younger. Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I
   hated (Rom. 9:11, 12, 13). And as many as were ordained to eternal life
   believed (Acts 13:48).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 11

   And as God Himself is most wise, unchangeable, omniscient, and
   omnipotent, so the election made by Him can neither be interrupted nor
   changed, recalled, or annulled; neither can the elect be cast away, nor
   their number diminished.

  Article 12

   The elect in due time, though in various degrees and in different
   measures, attain the assurance of this their eternal and unchangeable
   election, not by inquisitively prying into the secret and deep things
   of God, but by observing in themselves with a spiritual joy and holy
   pleasure the infallible fruits of election pointed out in the Word of
   God such as, a true faith in Christ, filial fear, a godly sorrow for
   sin, a hungering and thirsting after righteousness, etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 13

   The sense and certainty of this election afford to the children of God
   additional matter for daily humiliation before Him, for adoring the
   depth of His mercies, for cleansing themselves, and rendering grateful
   returns of ardent love to Him who first manifested so great love
   towards them. The consideration of this doctrine of election is so far
   from encouraging remissness in the observance of the divine commands or
   from sinking men in carnal security, that these, in the just judgment
   of God, are the usual effects of rash presumption or of idle and wanton
   trifling with the grace of election, in those who refuse to walk in the
   ways of the elect.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 14

   As the doctrine of divine election by the most wise counsel of God was
   declared by the prophets, by Christ Himself, and by the apostles, and
   is clearly revealed in the Scriptures both of the Old and the New
   Testament, so it is still to be published in due time and place in the
   Church of God, for which it was peculiarly designed, provided it be
   done with reverence, in the spirit of discretion and piety, for the
   glory of Gods most holy Name, and for enlivening and comforting His
   people, without vainly attempting to investigate the secret ways of the
   Most High (Acts 20:27; Rom. 11:33, 34; 12:3; Heb. 6:17, 18).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 15

   What peculiarly tends to illustrate and recommend to us the eternal and
   unmerited grace of election is the express testimony of sacred
   Scripture that not all, but some only, are elected, while others are
   passed by in the eternal decree; whom God, out of His sovereign, most
   just, irreprehensible, and unchangeable good pleasure, has decreed to
   leave in the common misery into which they have wilfully plunged
   themselves, and not to bestow upon them saving faith and the grace of
   conversion; but, permitting them in His just judgment to follow their
   own ways, at last, for the declaration of His justice, to condemn and
   punish them forever, not only on account of their unbelief, but also
   for all their other sins. And this is the decree of reprobation, which
   by no means makes God the Author of sin (the very thought of which is
   blasphemy), but declares Him to be an awful, irreprehensible, and
   righteous Judge and Avenger thereof.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 16

   Those in whom a living faith in Christ, an assured confidence of soul,
   peace of conscience, an earnest endeavor after filial obedience, a
   glorying in God through Christ, is not as yet strongly felt, and who
   nevertheless make use of the means which God has appointed for working
   these graces in us, ought not to be alarmed at the mention of
   reprobation, nor to rank themselves among the reprobate, but diligently
   to persevere in the use of means, and with ardent desires devoutly and
   humbly to wait for a season of richer grace. Much less cause to be
   terrified by the doctrine of reprobation have they who, though they
   seriously desire to be turned to God, to please Him only, and to be
   delivered from the body of death, cannot yet reach that measure of
   holiness and faith to which they aspire; since a merciful God has
   promised that He will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the
   bruised reed. But this doctrine is justly terrible to those who,
   regardless of God and of the Savior Jesus Christ, have wholly given
   themselves up to the cares of the world and the pleasures of the flesh,
   so long as they are not seriously converted to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 17

   Since we are to judge of the will of God from His Word, which testifies
   that the children of believers are holy, not by nature, but in virtue
   of the covenant of grace, in which they together with the parents are
   comprehended, godly parents ought not to doubt the election and
   salvation of their children whom it pleases God to call out of this
   life in their infancy (Gen. 17:7; Acts 2:39; 1 Cor. 7:14).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 18

   To those who murmur at the free grace of election and the just severity
   of reprobation we answer with the apostle: Nay but, O man, who art thou
   that repliest against God? (Rom. 9:20), and quote the language of our
   Savior: Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? (Matt.
   20:15). And therefore, with holy adoration of these mysteries, we
   exclaim in the words of the apostle: O the depth of the riches both of
   the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his
   judgments, and his ways past tracing out! For who hath known the mind
   of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor? or who hath first given
   to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and
   through him, and unto him are all things. To him be the glory for ever.
   Amen. (Rom. 11:33-36 ).
     __________________________________________________________________

Rejection of Errors

   The true doctrine concerning election and reprobation having been
   explained, the Synod rejects the errors of those:
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 1

   Who teach: That the will of God to save those who would believe and
   would persevere in faith and in the obedience of faith is the whole and
   entire decree of election unto salvation, and that nothing else
   concerning this decree has been revealed in Gods Word.

   For these deceive the simple and plainly contradict the Scriptures,
   which declare that God will not only save those who will believe, but
   that He has also from eternity chosen certain particular persons to
   whom, above others, He will grant, in time, both faith in Christ and
   perseverance; as it is written: I manifested thy name unto the men whom
   thou gavest me out of the world (John 17:6). And as many as were
   ordained to eternal life believed (Acts 13:48). And: Even as he chose
   us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy
   and without blemish before him in love (Eph. 1:4).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 2

   Who teach: That there are various kinds of election of God unto eternal
   life: the one general and indefinite, the other particular and
   definite; and that the latter in turn is either incomplete, revocable,
   non-decisive, and conditional, or complete, irrevocable, decisive, and
   absolute. Likewise: That there is one election unto faith and another
   unto salvation, so that election can be unto justifying faith, without
   being a decisive election unto salvation.

   For this is a fancy of mens minds, invented regardless of the
   Scriptures, whereby the doctrine of election is corrupted, and this
   golden chain of our salvation is broken: And whom he foreordained, them
   he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he
   justified, them he also glorified (Rom. 8:30).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 3

   Who teach: That the good pleasure and purpose of God, of which
   Scripture makes mention in the doctrine of election, does not consist
   in this, that God chose certain persons rather than others, but in
   this, that He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are
   also the works of the law), or out of the whole order of things, the
   act of faith which from its very nature is undeserving, as well as its
   incomplete obedience, as a condition of salvation, and that He would
   graciously consider this in itself as a complete obedience and count it
   worthy of the reward of eternal life.

   For by this injurious error the pleasure of God and the merits of
   Christ are made of none effect, and men are drawn away by useless
   questions from the truth of gracious justification and from the
   simplicity of Scripture, and this declaration of the apostle is charged
   as untrue: Who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not
   according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
   which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal (2 Tim. 1:9).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 4

   Who teach: That in the election unto faith this condition is beforehand
   demanded that man should use his innate understanding of God aright, be
   pious, humble, meek, and fit for eternal life, as if on these things
   election were in any way dependent.

   For this savors of the teaching of Pelagius, and is opposed to the
   doctrine of the apostle when he writes: Among whom we also all once
   lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of
   the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but
   God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together
   with Christ (by grace have ye been saved), and raised us up with him,
   and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus;
   that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his
   grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus; for by grace have ye been
   saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;
   not of works, that no man should glory (Eph. 2:3-9).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 5

   Who teach: That the incomplete and non-decisive election of particular
   persons to salvation occurred because of a foreseen faith, conversion,
   holiness, godliness, which either began or continued for some time; but
   that the complete and decisive election occurred because of foreseen
   perseverance unto the end in faith, conversion, holiness, and
   godliness; and that this is the gracious and evangelical worthiness,
   for the sake of which he who is chosen is more worthy than he who is
   not chosen; and that therefore faith, the obedience of faith, holiness,
   godliness, and perseverance are not fruits of the unchangeable election
   unto glory, but are conditions which, being required beforehand, were
   foreseen as being met by those who will be fully elected, and are
   causes without which the unchangeable election to glory does not occur.

   This is repugnant to the entire Scripture, which constantly inculcates
   this and similar declara tions: Election is not of works, but of him
   that calleth (Rom. 9:11). And as many as were ordained to eternal life
   believed ( Acts 13:48). He chose us in him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy (Eph. 1:4). Ye did not choose me, but I
   chose you (John 15:16). But if it is by grace, it is no more of works
   (Rom. 11:6). Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us, and sent his Son (1 John 4:10).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 6

   Who teach: That not every election unto salvation is unchangeable, but
   that some of the elect, any decree of God notwithstanding, can yet
   perish and do indeed perish.

   By this gross error they make God to be changeable, and destroy the
   comfort which the godly obtain out of the firmness of their election,
   and contradict the Holy Scripture, which teaches that the elect can not
   be led astray (Matt. 24:24), that Christ does not lose those whom the
   Father gave him (John 6:39), and that God also glorified those whom he
   foreordained, called, and justified (Rom. 8:30).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 7

   Who teach: That there is in this life no fruit and no consciousness of
   the unchangeable election to glory, nor any certainty, except that
   which depends on a changeable and uncertain condition.

   For not only is it absurd to speak of an uncertain certainty, but also
   contrary to the experience of the saints, who by virtue of the
   consciousness of their election rejoice with the apostle and praise
   this favor of God (Eph. 1); who according to Christs admonition rejoice
   with his disciples that their names are written in heaven (Luke 10:20);
   who also place the consciousness of their election over against the
   fiery darts of the devil, asking: Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of Gods elect? (Rom. 8:33 ).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 8

   Who teach: That God, simply by virtue of His righteous will, did not
   decide either to leave anyone in the fall of Adam and in the common
   state of sin and condemnation, or to pass anyone by in the
   communication of grace which is necessary for faith and conversion.

   For this is firmly decreed: He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he
   will he hardeneth (Rom. 9:18). And also this: Unto you it is given to
   know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
   given (Matt. 13:11). Likewise: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
   and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and
   understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes; yea, Father, for so it
   was well-pleasing in thy sight (Matt. 11:25, 26).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 9

   Who teach: That the reason why God sends the gospel to one people
   rather than to another is not merely and solely the good pleasure of
   God, but rather the fact that one people is better and worthier than
   another to which the gospel is not communicated.

   For this Moses denies, addressing the people of Israel as follows:
   Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of
   heavens, the earth, with all that is therein. Only Jehovah had a
   delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after
   them, even you above all peoples, as at this day(Deut. 10:14, 15). And
   Christ said: Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if
   the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in
   you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Matt.
   11:21).
     __________________________________________________________________

Second Head of Doctrine

The Death of Christ, and the Redemption of Men Thereby
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 1

   God is not only supremely merciful, but also supremely just. And His
   justice requires (as He has revealed Himself in His Word) that our sins
   committed against His infinite majesty should be punished, not only
   with temporal but with eternal punishments, both in body and soul;
   which we cannot escape, unless satisfaction be made to the justice of
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 2

   Since, therefore, we are unable to make that satisfaction in our own
   persons, or to deliver ourselves from the wrath of God, He has been
   pleased of His infinite mercy to give His only begotten Son for our
   Surety, who was made sin, and became a curse for us and in our stead,
   that He might make satisfaction to divine justice on our behalf.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 3

   The death of the Son of God is the only and most perfect sacrifice and
   satisfaction for sin, and is of infinite worth and value, abundantly
   sufficient to expiate the sins of the whole world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 4

   This death is of such infinite value and dignity because the person who
   submitted to it was not only really man and perfectly holy, but also
   the only begotten Son of God, of the same eternal and infinite essence
   with the Father and the Holy Spirit, which qualifications were
   necessary to constitute Him a Savior for us; and, moreover, because it
   was attended with a sense of the wrath and curse of God due to us for
   sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 5

   Moreover, the promise of the gospel is that whosoever believes in
   Christ crucified shall not perish, but have eternal life. This promise,
   together with the command to repent and believe, ought to be declared
   and published to all nations, and to all persons promiscuously and
   without distinction, to whom God out of His good pleasure sends the
   gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 6

   And, whereas many who are called by the gospel do not repent nor
   believe in Christ, but perish in unbelief, this is not owing to any
   defect or insufficiency in the sacrifice offered by Christ upon the
   cross, but is wholly to be imputed to themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 7

   But as many as truly believe, and are delivered and saved from sin and
   destruction through the death of Christ, are indebted for this benefit
   solely to the grace of God given them in Christ from everlasting, and
   not to any merit of their own.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 8

   For this was the sovereign counsel and most gracious will and purpose
   of God the Father that the quickening and saving efficacy of the most
   precious death of His Son should extend to all the elect, for bestowing
   upon them alone the gift of justifying faith, thereby to bring them
   infallibly to salvation; that is, it was the will of God that Christ by
   the blood of the cross, whereby He confirmed the new covenant, should
   effectually redeem out of every people, tribe, nation, and language,
   all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen to salvation
   and given to Him by the Father; that He should confer upon them faith,
   which, together with all the other saving gifts of the Holy Spirit, He
   purchased for them by His death; should purge them from all sin, both
   original and actual, whether committed before or after believing; and
   having faithfully preserved them even to the end, should at last bring
   them, free from every spot and blemish, to the enjoyment of glory in
   His own presence forever.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 9

   This purpose, proceeding from everlasting love towards the elect, has
   from the beginning of the world to this day been powerfully
   accomplished, and will henceforward still continue to be accomplished,
   notwithstanding all the ineffectual opposition of the gates of hell; so
   that the elect in due time may be gathered together into one, and that
   there never may be wanting a Church composed of believers, the
   foundation of which is laid in the blood of Christ; which may
   steadfastly love and faithfully serve Him as its Savior (who, as a
   bridegroom for his bride, laid down His life for them upon the cross);
   and which may celebrate His praises here and through all eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

Rejection of Errors

   The true doctrine having been explained, the Synod rejects the errors
   of those:
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 1

   Who teach: That God the Father has ordained His Son to the death of the
   cross without a certain and definite decree to save any, so that the
   necessity, profitableness, and worth of what Christ merited by His
   death might have existed, and might remain in all its parts complete,
   perfect, and intact, even if the merited redemption had never in fact
   been applied to any person.

   For this doctrine tends to the despising of the wisdom of the Father
   and of the merits of Jesus Christ, and is contrary to Scripture. For
   thus says our Savior: I lay down my life for the sheep, and I know them
   (John 10:15, 27). And the prophet Isaiah says concerning the Savior:
   When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his
   seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall
   prosper in his hand (Is. 53:10). Finally, this contradicts the article
   of faith according to which we believe the catholic Christian Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 2

   Who teach: That it was not the purpose of the death of Christ that He
   should confirm the new covenant of grace through His blood, but only
   that He should acquire for the Father the mere right to establish with
   man such a covenant as He might please, whether of grace or of works.

   For this is repugnant to Scripture which teaches that Christ hath
   become the surety and mediator of a better, that is, the new covenant,
   and that a testament is of force where there hath been death (Heb.
   7:22; 9:15, 17).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 3

   Who teach: That Christ by His satisfaction merited neither salvation
   itself for anyone, nor faith, whereby this satisfaction of Christ unto
   salvation is effectually appropriated; but that He merited for the
   Father only the authority or the perfect will to deal again with man,
   and to prescribe new conditions as He might desire, obedience to which,
   however, depended on the free will of man, so that it therefore might
   have come to pass that either none or all should fulfill these
   conditions.

   For these adjudge too contemptuously of the death of Christ, in no wise
   acknowledge the most important fruit or benefit thereby gained, and
   bring again out of hell the Pelagian error.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 4

   Who teach: That the new covenant of grace, which God the Father,
   through the mediation of the death of Christ, made with man, does not
   herein consist that we by faith, inasmuch as it accepts the merits of
   Christ, are justified before God and saved, but in the fact that God,
   having revoked the demand of perfect obedience of faith, regards faith
   itself and the obedience of faith, although imperfect, as the perfect
   obedience of the law, and does esteem it worthy of the reward of
   eternal life through grace.

   For these contradict the Scriptures: Being justified freely by his
   grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God set
   forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood (Rom. 3:24,
   25). And these proclaim, as did the wicked Socinus, a new and strange
   justification of man before God, against the consensus of the whole
   Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 5

   Who teach: That all men have been accepted unto the state of
   reconciliation and unto the grace of the covenant, so that no one is
   worthy of condemnation on account of original sin, and that no one
   shall be condemned because of it, but that all are free from the guilt
   of original sin.

   For this opinion is repugnant to Scripture which teaches that we are by
   nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3 ).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 6

   Who use the difference between meriting and appropriating, to the end
   that they may instil into the minds of the imprudent and inexperienced
   this teaching that God, as far as He is concerned, has been minded to
   apply to all equally the benefits gained by the death of Christ; but
   that, while some obtain the pardon of sin and eternal life, and others
   do not, this difference depends on their own free will, which joins
   itself to the grace that is offered without exception, and that it is
   not dependent on the special gift of mercy, which powerfully works in
   them, that they rather than others should appropriate unto themselves
   this grace.

   For these, while they feign that they present this distinction in a
   sound sense, seek to instil into the people the destructive poison of
   the Pelagian errors.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 7

   Who teach: That Christ neither could die, nor needed to die, and also
   did not die, for those whom God loved in the highest degree and elected
   to eternal life, since these do not need the death of Christ.

   For they contradict the apostle, who declares: Christ loved me, and
   gave himself up for me (Gal. 2:20). Likewise: Who shall lay anything to
   the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifieth; who is he that
   condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died (Rom. 8:33, 34), namely, for
   them; and the Savior who says: I lay down my life for the sheep (John
   10:15). And: This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as
   I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
   down his life for his friends (John 15:12, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine

The Corruption of Man, His Conversion to God, and the Manner Thereof
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 1

   Man was originally formed after the image of God. His understanding was
   adorned with a true and saving knowledge of his Creator, and of
   spiritual things; his heart and will were upright, all his affections
   pure, and the whole man was holy. But, revolting from God by the
   instigation of the devil and by his own free will, he forfeited these
   excellent gifts; and in the place thereof became involved in blindness
   of mind, horrible darkness, vanity, and perverseness of judgment;
   became wicked, rebellious, and obdurate in heart and will, and impure
   in his affections.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 2

   Man after the fall begat children in his own likeness. A corrupt stock
   produced a corrupt offspring. Hence all the posterity of Adam, Christ
   only excepted, have derived corruption from their original parent, not
   by imitation, as the Pelagians of old asserted, but by the propagation
   of a vicious nature, in consequence of the just judgment of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 3

   Therefore all men are conceived in sin, and are by nature children of
   wrath, incapable of saving good, prone to evil, dead in sin, and in
   bondage thereto; and without the regenerating grace of the Holy Spirit,
   they are neither able nor willing to return to God, to reform the
   depravity of their nature, or to dispose themselves to reformation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 4

   There remain, however, in man since the fall, the glimmerings of
   natural understanding, whereby he retains some knowledge of God, of
   natural things, and of the difference between good and evil, and shows
   some regard for virtue and for good outward behavior. But so far is
   this understanding of nature from being sufficient to bring him to a
   saving knowledge of God and to true conversion that he is incapable of
   using it aright even in things natural and civil. Nay further, this
   understanding, such as it is, man in various ways renders wholly
   polluted, and hinders in unrighteousness, by doing which he becomes
   inexcusable before God.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 5

   Neither can the decalogue delivered by God to His peculiar people, the
   Jews, by the hands of Moses, save men. For though it reveals the
   greatness of sin, and more and more convinces man thereof, yet, as it
   neither points out a remedy nor imparts strength to extricate him from
   this misery, but, being weak through the flesh, leaves the transgressor
   under the curse, man cannot by this law obtain saving grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 6

   What, therefore, neither the innate understanding nor the law could do,
   that God performs by the operation of the Holy Spirit through the word
   or ministry of reconciliation; which is the glad tidings concerning the
   Messiah, by means whereof it has pleased God to save such as believe,
   as well under the Old as under the New Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 7

   This mystery of His will God revealed to but a small number under the
   Old Testament; under the New Testament (the distinction between various
   peoples having been removed) He reveals it to many. The cause of this
   dispensation is not to be ascribed to the superior worth of one nation
   above another, nor to their better use of the innate understanding of
   God, but results wholly from the sovereign good pleasure and unmerited
   love of God. Hence they to whom so great and so gracious a blessing is
   communicated, above their desert, or rather notwithstanding their
   demerits, are bound to acknowledge it with humble and grateful hearts,
   and with the apostle to adore, but in no wise curiously to pry into,
   the severity and justice of God's judgments displayed in others to whom
   this grace is not given.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 8

   As many as are called by the gospel are unfeignedly called. For God has
   most earnestly and truly declared in His Word what is acceptable to
   Him, namely, that those who are called should come unto Him. He also
   seriously promises rest of soul and eternal life to all who come to Him
   and believe.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 9

   It is not the fault of the gospel, nor of Christ offered therein, nor
   of God, who calls men by the gospel and confers upon them various
   gifts, that those who are called by the ministry of the Word refuse to
   come and be converted. The fault lies in themselves; some of whom when
   called, regardless of their danger, reject the Word of life; others,
   though they receive it, suffer it not to make a lasting impression on
   their heart; therefore, their joy, arising only from a temporary faith,
   soon vanishes, and they fall away; while others choke the seed of the
   Word by perplexing cares and the pleasures of this world, and produce
   no fruit. This our Savior teaches in the parable of the sower (Matt.
   13).

  Article 10

   But that others who are called by the gospel obey the call and are
   converted is not to be ascribed to the proper exercise of free will,
   whereby one distinguishes himself above others equally furnished with
   grace sufficient for faith and conversion (as the proud heresy of
   Pelagius maintains); but it must be wholly ascribed to God, who, as He
   has chosen His own from eternity in Christ, so He calls them
   effectually in time, confers upon them faith and repentance, rescues
   them from the power of darkness, and translates them into the kingdom
   of His own Son; that they may show forth the praises of Him who has
   called them out of darkness into His marvelous light, and may glory not
   in themselves but in the Lord, according to the testimony of the
   apostles in various places.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 11

   But when God accomplishes His good pleasure in the elect, or works in
   them true conversion, He not only causes the gospel to be externally
   preached to them, and powerfully illuminates their minds by His Holy
   Spirit, that they may rightly understand and discern the things of the
   Spirit of God; but by the efficacy of the same regenerating Spirit He
   pervades the inmost recesses of man; He opens the closed and softens
   the hardened heart, and circumcises that which was uncircumcised;
   infuses new qualities into the will, which, though heretofore dead, He
   quickens; from being evil, disobedient, and refractory, He renders it
   good, obedient, and pliable; actuates and strengthens it, that like a
   good tree, it may bring forth the fruits of good actions.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 12

   And this is that regeneration so highly extolled in Scripture, that
   renewal, new creation, resurrection from the dead, making alive, which
   God works in us without our aid. But this is in no wise effected merely
   by the external preaching of the gospel, by moral suasion, or such a
   mode of operation that, after God has performed His part, it still
   remains in the power of man to be regenerated or not, to be converted
   or to continue unconverted; but it is evidently a supernatural work,
   most powerful, and at the same time most delightful, astonishing,
   mysterious, and ineffable; not inferior in efficacy to creation or the
   resurrection from the dead, as the Scripture inspired by the Author of
   this work declares; so that all in whose heart God works in this
   marvelous manner are certainly, infallibly, and effectually
   regenerated, and do actually believe. Whereupon the will thus renewed
   is not only actuated and influenced by God, but in consequence of this
   influence becomes itself active. Wherefore also man himself is rightly
   said to believe and repent by virtue of that grace received.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 13

   The manner of this operation cannot be fully comprehended by believers
   in this life. Nevertheless, they are satisfied to know and experience
   that by this grace of God they are enabled to believe with the heart
   and to love their Savior.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 14

   Faith is therefore to be considered as the gift of God, not on account
   of its being offered by God to man, to be accepted or rejected at his
   pleasure, but because it is in reality conferred upon him, breathed and
   infused into him; nor even because God bestows the power or ability to
   believe, and then expects that man should by the exercise of his own
   free will consent to the terms of salvation and actually believe in
   Christ, but because He who works in man both to will and to work, and
   indeed all things in all, produces both the will to believe and the act
   of believing also.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 15

   God is under no obligation to confer this grace upon any; for how can
   He be indebted to one who had no previous gifts to bestow as a
   foundation for such recompense? Nay, how can He be indebted to one who
   has nothing of his own but sin and falsehood? He, therefore, who
   becomes the subject of this grace owes eternal gratitude to God, and
   gives Him thanks forever. Whoever is not made partaker thereof is
   either altogether regardless of these spiritual gifts and satisfied
   with his own condition, or is in no apprehension of danger, and vainly
   boasts the possession of that which he has not. Further, with respect
   to those who outwardly profess their faith and amend their lives, we
   are bound, after the example of the apostle, to judge and speak of them
   in the most favorable manner; for the secret recesses of the heart are
   unknown to us. And as to others who have not yet been called, it is our
   duty to pray for them to God, who calls the things that are not as if
   they were. But we are in no wise to conduct ourselves towards them with
   haughtiness, as if we had made ourselves to differ.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 16

   But as man by the fall did not cease to be a creature endowed with
   understanding and will, nor did sin which pervaded the whole race of
   mankind deprive him of the human nature, but brought upon him depravity
   and spiritual death; so also this grace of regeneration does not treat
   men as senseless stocks and blocks, nor take away their will and its
   properties, or do violence thereto; but it spiritually quickens, heals,
   corrects, and at the same time sweetly and powerfully bends it, that
   where carnal rebellion and resistance formerly prevailed, a ready and
   sincere spiritual obedience begins to reign; in which the true and
   spiritual restoration and freedom of our will consist. Wherefore,
   unless the admirable Author of every good work so deal with us, man can
   have no hope of being able to rise from his fall by his own free will,
   by which, in a state of innocence, he plunged himself into ruin.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 17

   As the almighty operation of God whereby He brings forth and supports
   this our natural life does not exclude but require the use of means by
   which God, of His infinite mercy and goodness, has chosen to exert His
   influence, so also the aforementioned supernatural operation of God by
   which we are regenerated in no wise excludes or subverts the use of the
   gospel, which the most wise God has ordained to be the seed of
   regeneration and food of the soul. Wherefore, as the apostles and the
   teachers who succeeded them piously instructed the people concerning
   this grace of God, to His glory and to the abasement of all pride, and
   in the meantime, however, neglected not to keep them, by the holy
   admoni tions of the gospel, under the influence of the Word, the
   sacraments, and ecclesiastical discipline; so even now it should be far
   from those who give or receive instruction in the Church to presume to
   tempt God by separating what He of His good pleasure has most
   intimately joined together. For grace is conferred by means of
   admonitions; and the more readily we perform our duty, the more clearly
   this favor of God, working in us, usually manifests itself, and the
   more directly His work is advanced; to whom alone all the glory, both
   for the means and for their saving fruit and efficacy, is forever due.
   Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

Rejection of Errors

   The true doctrine having been explained, the Synod rejects the errors
   of those:
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 1

   Who teach: That it cannot properly be said that original sin in itself
   suffices to condemn the whole human race or to deserve temporal and
   eternal punishment.

   For these contradict the apostle, who declares: Therefore, as through
   one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death
   passed unto all men, for that all sinned (Rom. 5:12). And: The judgment
   came of one unto condemnation (Rom. 5:16). And: The wages of sin is
   death (Rom. 6:23).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 2

   Who teach: That the spiritual gifts or the good qualities and virtues,
   such as goodness, holiness, righteousness, could not belong to the will
   of man when he was first created, and that these, therefore, cannot
   have been separated therefrom in the fall.

   For such is contrary to the description of the image of God which the
   apostle gives in Eph. 4:24, where he declares that it consists in
   righteousness and holiness, which undoubtedly belong to the will.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 3

   Who teach: That in spiritual death the spiritual gifts are not separate
   from the will of man, since the will in itself has never been
   corrupted, but only hindered through the darkness of the understanding
   and the irregularity of the affections; and that, these hindrances
   having been removed, the will can then bring into operation its native
   powers, that is, that the will of itself is able to will and to choose,
   or not to will and not to choose, all manner of good which may be
   presented to it.

   This is an innovation and an error, and tends to elevate the powers of
   the free will, contrary to the declaration of the prophet: The heart is
   deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt (Jer. 17:9);
   and of the apostle: Among whom (sons of disobedience) we also all once
   lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of
   the mind ( Eph. 2:3).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 4

   Who teach: That the unregenerate man is not really nor utterly dead in
   sin, nor destitute of all powers unto spiritual good, but that he can
   yet hunger and thirst after righteousness and life, and offer the
   sacrifice of a contrite and broken spirit, which is pleasing to God.

   For these things are contrary to the express testimony of Scripture: Ye
   were dead through your trespasses and sins ( Eph. 2:1, 5). And: Every
   imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
   (Gen. 6:5; 8:21). Moreover, to hunger and thirst after deliverance from
   misery and after life, and to offer unto God the sacrifice of a broken
   spirit, is peculiar to the regenerate and those that are called blessed
   (Ps. 51:17; Matt. 5:6).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 5

   Who teach: That the corrupt and natural man can so well use the common
   grace (by which they understand the light of nature), or the gifts
   still left him after the fall, that he can gradually gain by their good
   use a greater, that is, the evangelical or saving grace, and salvation
   itself; and that in this way God on His part shows Himself ready to
   reveal Christ unto all men, since He applies to all sufficiently and
   efficiently the means necessary to conversion.

   For both the experience of all ages and the Scriptures testify that
   this is untrue. He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his
   ordinances unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as
   for his ordinances, they have not known them (Ps. 147:19, 20). Who in
   the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own
   way (Acts 14:16). And: And they (Paul and his companions) having been
   forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia, when they were
   come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia, and the
   Spirit of Jesus suffered them not (Acts 16:6, 7).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 6

   Who teach: That in the true conversion of man no new qualities, powers,
   or gifts can be infused by God into the will, and that therefore faith,
   through which we are first converted and because of which we are called
   believers, is not a quality or gift infused by God but only an act of
   man, and that it cannot be said to be a gift, except in respect of the
   power to attain to this faith.

   For thereby they contradict the Holy Scriptures, which declare that God
   infuses new qualities of faith, of obedience, and of the consciousness
   of His love into our hearts: I will put my law in their inward parts,
   and in their heart will I write it (Jer. 31:33). And: I will pour water
   upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour
   my Spirit upon thy seed ( Is. 44:3). And: The love of God hath been
   shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto
   us (Rom. 5:5). This is also repugnant to the constant practice of the
   Church, which prays by the mouth of the prophet thus: Turn thou me, and
   I shall be turned (Jer. 31:18).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 7

   Who teach: That the grace whereby we are converted to God is only a
   gentle advising, or (as others explain it) that this is the noblest
   manner of working in the conversion of man, and that this manner of
   working, which consists in advising, is most in harmony with mans
   nature; and that there is no reason why this advising grace alone
   should not be sufficient to make the natural man spiritual; indeed,
   that God does not produce the consent of the will except through this
   manner of advising; and that the power of the divine working, whereby
   it surpasses the working of Satan, consists in this that God promises
   eternal, while Satan promises only temporal goods.

   But this is altogether Pelagian and contrary to the whole Scripture,
   which, besides this, teaches yet another and far more powerful and
   divine manner of the Holy Spirits working in the conversion of man, as
   in Ezekiel: A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
   put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,
   and I will give you a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 8

   Who teach: That God in the regeneration of man does not use such powers
   of His omnipotence as potently and infallibly bend mans will to faith
   and conversion; but that all the works of grace having been
   accomplished, which God employs to convert man, man may yet so resist
   God and the Holy Spirit, when God intends mans regeneration and wills
   to regenerate him, and indeed that man often does so resist that he
   prevents entirely his regeneration, and that it therefore remains in
   mans power to be regenerated or not.

   For this is nothing less than the denial of all the efficiency of Gods
   grace in our conversion, and the subjecting of the working of Almighty
   God to the will of man, which is contrary to the apostles, who teach
   that we believe according to the working of the strength of his might
   (Eph. 1:19); and that God fulfills every desire of goodness and every
   work of faith with power (2 Thess. 1:11); and that his divine power
   hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness (2
   Peter 1:3).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 9

   Who teach: That grace and free will are partial causes which together
   work the beginning of conversion, and that grace, in order of working,
   does not precede the working of the will; that is, that God does not
   efficiently help the will of man unto conversion until the will of man
   moves and determines to do this.

   For the ancient Church has long ago condemned this doctrine of the
   Pelagians according to the words of the apostle: So then it is not of
   him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy
   (Rom. 9:16). Likewise: For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast
   thou that thou didst not receive? (1 Cor. 4:7). And: For it is God who
   worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure (Phil.
   2:13).
     __________________________________________________________________

Fifth Head of Doctrine

The Perseverance of the Saints
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 1

   Those whom God, according to His purpose, calls to the communion of His
   Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and regenerates by the Holy Spirit, He also
   delivers from the dominion and slavery of sin, though in this life He
   does not deliver them altogether from the body of sin and from the
   infirmities of the flesh.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 2

   Hence spring forth the daily sins of infirmity, and blemishes cleave
   even to the best works of the saints. These are to them a perpetual
   reason to humiliate themselves before God and to flee for refuge to
   Christ crucified; to mortify the flesh more and more by the spirit of
   prayer and by holy exercises of piety; and to press forward to the goal
   of perfection, until at length, delivered from this body of death, they
   shall reign with the Lamb of God in heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 3

   By reason of these remains of indwelling sin, and also because of the
   temptations of the world and of Satan, those who are converted could
   not persevere in that grace if left to their own strength. But God is
   faithful, who, having conferred grace, mercifully confirms and
   powerfully preserves them therein, even to the end.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 4

   Although the weakness of the flesh cannot prevail against the power of
   God, who confirms and preserves true believers in a state of grace, yet
   converts are not always so influenced and actuated by the Spirit of God
   as not in some particular instances sinfully to deviate from the
   guidance of divine grace, so as to be seduced by and to comply with the
   lusts of the flesh; they must, therefore, be constant in watching and
   prayer, that they may not be led into temptation. When these are
   neglected, they are not only liable to be drawn into great and heinous
   sins by the flesh, the world, and Satan, but sometimes by the righteous
   permission of God actually are drawn into these evils. This, the
   lamentable fall of David, Peter, and other saints described in Holy
   Scripture, demonstrates.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 5

   By such enormous sins, however, they very highly offend God, incur a
   deadly guilt, grieve the Holy Spirit, interrupt the exercise of faith,
   very grievously wound their consciences, and sometimes for a while lose
   the sense of Gods favor, until, when they change their course by
   serious repentance, the light of Gods fatherly countenance again shines
   upon them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 6

   But God, who is rich in mercy, according to His unchangeable purpose of
   election, does not wholly withdraw the Holy Spirit from His own people
   even in their grievous falls; nor suffers them to proceed so far as to
   lose the grace of adoption and forfeit the state of justification, or
   to commit the sin unto death or against the Holy Spirit; nor does He
   permit them to be totally deserted, and to plunge themselves into
   everlasting destruction.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 7

   For in the first place, in these falls He preserves in them the
   incorruptible seed of regeneration from perishing or being totally
   lost; and again, by His Word and Spirit He certainly and effectually
   renews them to repentance, to a sincere and godly sorrow for their
   sins, that they may seek and obtain remission in the blood of the
   Mediator, may again experience the favor of a reconciled God, through
   faith adore His mercies, and henceforward more diligently work out
   their own salvation with fear and trembling.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 8

   Thus it is not in consequence of their own merits or strength, but of
   Gods free mercy, that they neither totally fall from faith and grace
   nor continue and perish finally in their backslidings; which, with
   respect to themselves is not only possible, but would undoubtedly
   happen; but with respect to God, it is utterly impossible, since His
   counsel cannot be changed nor His promise fail; neither can the call
   according to His purpose be revoked, nor the merit, inter- cession, and
   preservation of Christ be rendered ineffectual, nor the sealing of the
   Holy Spirit be frustrated or obliterated.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 9

   Of this preservation of the elect to salvation and of their
   perseverance in the faith, true believers themselves may and do obtain
   assurance according to the measure of their faith, whereby they surely
   believe that they are and ever will continue true and living members of
   the Church, and that they have the forgiveness of sins and life
   eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 10

   This assurance, however, is not produced by any peculiar revelation
   contrary to or independent of the Word of God, but springs from faith
   in Gods promises, which He has most abundantly revealed in His Word for
   our comfort; from the testimony of the Holy Spirit, witnessing with our
   spirit that we are children and heirs of God (Rom. 8:16); and lastly,
   from a serious and holy desire to preserve a good conscience and to
   perform good works. And if the elect of God were deprived of this solid
   comfort that they shall finally obtain the victory, and of this
   infallible pledge of eternal glory, they would be of all men the most
   miserable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 11

   The Scripture moreover testifies that believers in this life have to
   struggle with various carnal doubts, and that under grievous
   temptations they do not always feel this full assurance of faith and
   certainty of persevering. But God, who is the Father of all
   consolation, does not suffer them to be tempted above that they are
   able, but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that
   they may be able to endure it (1 Cor. 10:13), and by the Holy Spirit
   again inspires them with the comfortable assurance of persevering.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 12

   This certainty of perseverance, however, is so far from exciting in
   believers a spirit of pride, or of rendering them carnally secure, that
   on the contrary it is the real source of humility, filial reverence,
   true piety, patience in every tribulation, fervent prayers, constancy
   in suffering and in confessing the truth, and of solid rejoicing in
   God; so that the consideration of this benefit should serve as an
   incentive to the serious and constant practice of gratitude and good
   works, as appears from the testimonies of Scripture and the examples of
   the saints.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 13

   Neither does renewed confidence of persevering produce licentiousness
   or a disregard of piety in those who are recovered from backsliding;
   but it renders them much more careful and solicitous to continue in the
   ways of the Lord, which He has ordained, that they who walk therein may
   keep the assurance of persevering; lest, on account of their abuse of
   His fatherly kindness, God should turn away His gracious countenance
   from them (to behold which is to the godly dearer than life, and the
   withdrawal of which is more bitter than death) and they in consequence
   thereof should fall into more grievous torments of conscience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 14

   And as it has pleased God, by the preaching of the gospel, to begin
   this work of grace in us, so He preserves, continues, and perfects it
   by the hearing and reading of His Word, by meditation thereon, and by
   the exhortations, threatenings, and promises thereof, and by the use of
   the sacraments.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Article 15

   The carnal mind is unable to comprehend this doctrine of the
   perseverance of the saints and the certainty thereof, which God has
   most abundantly revealed in His Word, for the glory of His Name and the
   consolation of pious souls, and which He impresses upon the hearts of
   the believers. Satan abhors it, the world ridicules it, the ignorant
   and hypocritical abuse it, and the heretics oppose it. But the bride of
   Christ has always most tenderly loved and constantly defended it as an
   inestimable treasure; and God, against whom neither counsel nor
   strength can prevail, will dispose her so to continue to the end. Now
   to this one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, be honor and glory
   forever. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

Rejection of Errors

   The true doctrine having been explained, the Synod rejects the errors
   of those:
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 1

   Who teach: That the perseverance of the true believers is not a fruit
   of election, or a gift of God gained by the death of Christ, but a
   condition of the new covenant, which (as they declare) man before his
   decisive election and justification must fulfil through his free will.

   For the Holy Scripture testifies that this follows out of election, and
   is given the elect in virtue of the death, the resurrection, and
   intercession of Christ: But the election obtained it, and the rest were
   hardened (Rom. 11:7). Likewise: He that spared not his own Son, but
   delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give
   us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of Gods elect? It
   is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus
   that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the
   right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall
   separate us from the love of Christ? (Rom. 8:32-35).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 2

   Who teach: That God does indeed provide the believer with sufficient
   powers to persevere, and is ever ready to preserve these in him if he
   will do his duty; but that, though all things which are necessary to
   persevere in faith and which God will use to preserve faith are made
   use of, even then it ever depends on the pleasure of the will whether
   it will persevere or not.

   For this idea contains an outspoken Pelagianism, and while it would
   make men free, it makes them robbers of Gods honor, contrary to the
   prevailing agreement of the evangelical doctrine, which takes from man
   all cause of boasting, and ascribes all the praise for this favor to
   the grace of God alone; and contrary to the apostle, who declares that
   it is God, who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be
   unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:8).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 3

   Who teach: That the true believers and regenerate not only can fall
   from justifying faith and likewise from grace and salvation wholly and
   to the end, but indeed often do fall from this and are lost forever.

   For this conception makes powerless the grace, justification,
   regeneration, and continued preservation by Christ, contrary to the
   expressed words of the apostle Paul: That, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood,
   shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him (Rom. 5:8, 9). And
   contrary to the apostle John: Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no
   sin, because his seed abideth in him; and he can not sin, because he is
   begotten of God (1 John 3:9). And also contrary to the words of Jesus
   Christ: I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and
   no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who hath given them
   to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of
   the Fathers hand (John 10:28, 29).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 4

   Who teach: That true believers and regenerate can sin the sin unto
   death or against the Holy Spirit.

   Since the same apostle John, after having spoken in the fifth chapter
   of his first epistle, vs. 16 and 17, of those who sin unto death and
   having forbidden to pray for them, immediately adds to this in vs. 18:
   We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not (meaning a sin of
   that character), but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and
   the evil one toucheth him not (1 John 5:18).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 5

   Who teach: That without a special revelation we can have no certainty
   of future perseverance in this life.

   For by this doctrine the sure comfort of the true believers is taken
   away in this life, and the doubts of the papist are again introduced
   into the Church, while the Holy Scriptures constantly deduce this
   assurance, not from a special and extraordinary revelation, but from
   the marks proper to the children of God and from the very constant
   promises of God. So especially the apostle Paul: No creature shall be
   able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord (Rom. 8:39). And John declares: And he that keepeth his
   commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he
   abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us (1 John 3:24).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 6

   Who teach: That the doctrine of the certainty of perseverance and of
   salvation from its own character and nature is a cause of indolence and
   is injurious to godliness, good morals, prayers, and other holy
   exercises, but that on the contrary it is praiseworthy to doubt.

   For these show that they do not know the power of divine grace and the
   working of the indwelling Holy Spirit. And they contradict the apostle
   John, who teaches the opposite with express words in his first epistle:
   Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest
   what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be
   like him; for we shall see him even as he is. And every one that hath
   this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure (1 John 3:2,
   3). Furthermore, these are contradicted by the example of the saints,
   both of the Old and the New Testament, who though they were assured of
   their perseverance and salvation, were nevertheless constant in prayers
   and other exercises of godliness.

  Paragraph 7

   Who teach: That the faith of those who believe for a time does not
   differ from justifying and saving faith except only in duration.

   For Christ Himself, in Matt. 13:20, Luke 8:13, and in other places,
   evidently notes, besides this duration, a threefold difference between
   those who believe only for a time and true believers, when He declares
   that the former receive the seed in stony ground, but the latter in the
   good ground or heart; that the former are without root, but the latter
   have a firm root; that the former are without fruit, but that the
   latter bring forth their fruit in various measure, with constancy and
   steadfastness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 8

   Who teach: That it is not absurd that one having lost his first
   regeneration is again and even often born anew.

   For these deny by this doctrine the incorruptibleness of the seed of
   God, whereby we are born again; contrary to the testimony of the
   apostle Peter: Having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but
   of incorruptible (1 Peter 1:23).
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paragraph 9

   Who teach: That Christ has in no place prayed that believers should
   infallibly continue in faith.

   For they contradict Christ Himself, who says: I made supplication for
   thee (Simon), that thy faith fail not ( Luke 22:32), and the evangelist
   John, who declares that Christ has not prayed for the apostles only,
   but also for those who through their word would believe: Holy Father,
   keep them in thy name, and: I pray not that thou shouldest take them
   from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
   one(John 17:11, 15, 20 ).
     __________________________________________________________________

Conclusion

   And this is the perspicuous, simple, and ingenuous declaration of the
   orthodox doctrine respecting the five articles which have been
   controverted in the Belgic Churches; and the rejection of the errors,
   with which they have for some time been troubled. This doctrine the
   Synod judges to be drawn from the Word of God, and to be agreeable to
   the confession of the Reformed Churches. Whence it clearly appears that
   some, whom such conduct by no means became, have violated all truth,
   equity, and charity, in wishing to persuade the public:

   That the doctrine of the Reformed Churches concerning predestination,
   and the points annexed to it, by its own genius and necessary tendency,
   leads off the minds of men from all piety and religion; that it is an
   opiate administered by the flesh and the devil; and the stronghold of
   Satan, where he lies in wait for all, and from which he wounds
   multitudes, and mortally strikes through many with the darts both of
   despair and security; that it makes God the author of sin, unjust,
   tyrannical, hypocritical; that it is nothing more than an interpolated
   Stoicism, Manicheism, Libertinism, Turcism; that it renders men
   carnally secure, since they are persuaded by it that nothing can hinder
   the salvation of the elect, let them live as they please; and,
   therefore, that they may safely perpetrate every species of the most
   atrocious crimes; and that, if the reprobate should even perform truly
   all the works of the saints, their obedience would not in the least
   contribute to their salvation; that the same doctrine teaches that God,
   by a mere arbitrary act of his will, without the least respect or view
   to any sin, has predestinated the greatest part of the world to eternal
   damnation, and has created them for this very purpose; that in the same
   manner in which the election is the fountain and cause of faith and
   good works, reprobation is the cause of unbelief and impiety; that many
   children of the faithful are torn, guiltless, from their mothers
   breasts, and tyrannically plunged into hell: so that neither baptism
   nor the prayers of the Church at their baptism can at all profit them ;
   and many other things of the same kind which the Reformed Churches not
   only do not acknowledge, but even detest with their whole soul.

   Wherefore, this Synod of Dort, in the name of the Lord, conjures as
   many as piously call upon the name of our Savior Jesus Christ to judge
   of the faith of the Reformed Churches, not from the calumnies which on
   every side are heaped upon it, nor from the private expressions of a
   few among ancient and modern teachers, often dishonestly quoted, or
   corrupted and wrested to a meaning quite foreign to their intention;
   but from the public confessions of the Churches themselves, and from
   this declaration of the orthodox doctrine, confirmed by the unanimous
   consent of all and each of the members of the whole Synod. Moreover,
   the Synod warns calumniators themselves to consider the terrible
   judgment of God which awaits them, for bearing false witness against
   the confessions of so many Churches; for distressing the consciences of
   the weak; and for laboring to render suspected the society of the truly
   faithful.

   Finally, this Synod exhorts all their brethren in the gospel of Christ
   to conduct themselves piously and religiously in handling this
   doctrine, both in the universities and churches; to direct it, as well
   in discourse as in writing, to the glory of the Divine name, to
   holiness of life, and to the consolation of afflicted souls; to
   regulate, by the Scripture, according to the analogy of faith, not only
   their sentiments, but also their language, and to abstain from all
   those phrases which exceed the limits necessary to be observed in
   ascertaining the genuine sense of the Holy Scriptures, and may furnish
   insolent sophists with a just pretext for violently assailing, or even
   vilifying, the doctrine of the Reformed Churches. May Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, who, seated at the Fathers right hand, gives gifts to men,
   sanctify us in the truth; bring to the truth those who err; shut the
   mouths of the calumniators of sound doctrine, and endue the faithful
   ministers of his Word with the spirit of wisdom and discretion, that
   all their discourses may tend to the glory of God, and the edification
   of those who hear them. Amen.

                             The Belgic Confession

   The Belgic Confession was originally composed in 1561 by Guido de Bres
   for the churches in Flanders and the Netherlands. It was adopted by a
   Reformed Synod at Emden, in 1571. During the Synod of Dordt in
   1618-1619, several editions of the Confession in differing languages
   (French, Dutch, and Latin) were carefully examined and an official,
   revised edition was produced. According to Schaff, "It is, upon the
   whole, the best symbolical statement of the Calvinistic system of
   doctrine, with the exception of the Westminster Confession." [385]
     __________________________________________________________________

Article I

There Is Only One God

   We all believe with the heart and confess with the mouth that there is
   one only simple and spiritual Being, which we call God; and that He is
   eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty,
   perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article II

By What Means God Is Made Known unto Us

   We know Him by two means: First, by the creation, preservation, and
   government of the universe; which is before our eyes as a most elegant
   book, wherein all creatures, great and small, are as so many characters
   leading us to see clearly the invisible things of God, even his
   everlasting power and divinity, as the apostle Paul says (Rom. 1:20).
   All which things are sufficient to convince men and leave them without
   excuse. Second, He makes Himself more clearly and fully known to us by
   His holy and divine Word, that is to say, as far as is necessary for us
   to know in this life, to His glory and our salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article III

The Written Word of God

   We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will
   of man, but that men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as
   the apostle Peter says; and that afterwards God, from a special care
   which He has for us and our salvation, commanded His servants, the
   prophets and apostles, to commit His revealed word to writing; and He
   Himself wrote with His own finger the two tables of the law. Therefore
   we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article IV

Canonical Books of the Holy Scripture

   We believe that the Holy Scriptures are contained in two books, namely,
   the Old and the New Testament, which are canonical, against which
   nothing can be alleged. These are thus named in the Church of God.

   The books of the Old Testament are the five books of Moses, to wit:
   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the book of Joshua,
   Judges, Ruth, the two books of Samuel, the two of the Kings, two books
   of the Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther; Job, the Psalms, the three
   books of Solomon, namely, the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of
   Songs; the four great prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah (Lamentations),
   Ezekiel, and Daniel; and the twelve lesser prophets, namely, Hosea,
   Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
   Zechariah, and Malachi.

   Those of the New Testament are the four evangelists, to wit: Matthew,
   Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the thirteen epistles
   of the apostle Paul, namely, one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians,
   one to the Galatians, one to the Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one
   to the Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, one to
   Titus, one to Philemon; Hebrews; the seven epistles of the other
   apostles, namely, one of James, two of Peter, three of John, one of
   Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article V

Whence the Holy Scriptures Derive Their Dignity and Authority

   We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for
   the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith; believing
   without any doubt all things contained in them, not so much because the
   Church receives and approves them as such, but more especially because
   the Holy Spirit witnesses in our hearts that they are from God, and
   also because they carry the evidence thereof in themselves. For the
   very blind are able to perceive that the things foretold in them are
   being fulfilled.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article VI

The Difference Between the Canonical and Apocryphal Books

   We distinguish those sacred books from the apocryphal, viz: the third
   and fourth books of Esdras, the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus
   Sirach, Baruch, the Appendix to the book of Esther, the Song of the
   Three Children in the Furnace, the History of Susannah, of Bel and the
   Dragon, the Prayer of Manasseh, and the two books of the Maccabees. All
   of which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they
   agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power
   and efficacy that we may from their testimony confirm any point of
   faith or of the Christian religion; much less may they be used to
   detract from the authority of the other, that is, the sacred books.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article VII

The Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures to Be the Only Rule of Faith

   We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God,
   and that whatsoever man ought to believe unto salvation is sufficiently
   taught therein. For since the whole manner of worship which God
   requires of us is written in them at large, it is unlawful for any one,
   though an apostle, to teach otherwise than we are now taught in the
   Holy Scriptures: nay, though it were an angel from heaven, as the
   apostle Paul says. For since it is forbidden to add unto or take away
   anything from the Word of God, it does thereby evidently appear that
   the doctrine thereof is most perfect and complete in all respects.

   Neither may we consider any writings of men, however holy these men may
   have been, of equal value with those divine Scriptures, nor ought we to
   consider custom, or the great multitude, or antiquity, or succession of
   times and persons, or councils, decrees or statutes, as of equal value
   with the truth of God, since the truth is above all; for all men are of
   themselves liars, and more vain than vanity itself. Therefore we reject
   with all our hearts whatsoever does not agree with this infallible
   rule, as the apostles have taught us, saying, Prove the spirits,
   whether they are of God. Likewise: If any one cometh unto you, and
   bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article VIII

God Is One in Essence, Yet Distinguished in Three Persons

   According to this truth and this Word of God, we believe in one only
   God, who is the one single essence, in which are three persons, really,
   truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable
   properties; namely, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The
   Father is the cause, origin, and beginning of all things visible and
   invisible; the Son is the word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the
   Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father
   and the Son. Nevertheless, God is not by this distinction divided into
   three, since the Holy Scriptures teach us that the Father, and the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit have each His personality, distinguished by Their
   properties; but in such wise that these three persons are but one only
   God.

   Hence, then, it is evident that the Father is not the Son, nor the Son
   the Father, and likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the
   Son. Nevertheless, these persons thus distinguished are not divided,
   nor intermixed; for the Father has not assumed the flesh, nor has the
   Holy Spirit, but the Son only. The Father has never been without His
   Son, or without His Holy Spirit. For They are all three co-eternal and
   co-essential. There is neither first nor last; for They are all three
   one, in truth, in power, in goodness, and in mercy.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article IX

The Proof of the Foregoing Article of the Trinity of Persons in One God

   All this we know as well from the testimonies of Holy Writ as from
   their operations, and chiefly by those we feel in ourselves. The
   testimonies of the Holy Scriptures that teach us to believe this Holy
   Trinity are written in many places of the Old Testament, which are not
   so necessary to enumerate as to choose them out with discretion and
   judgment.

   In Genesis, chap. 1:26, 27, God says: Let us make man in our image,
   after our likeness, etc. And God created man in his own image, male and
   female created he them. And Gen. 3:22 , Behold, the man is become as
   one of us. From this saying, Let us make man in our image, it appears
   that there are more persons than one in the Godhead; and when He says,
   God created, He signifies the unity. It is true, He does not say how
   many persons there are, but that which appears to us somewhat obscure
   in the Old Testament is very plain in the New. For when our Lord was
   baptized in Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard, saying, This is
   my beloved Son; the Son was seen in the water, and the Holy Spirit
   appeared in the shape of a dove. This form is also instituted by Christ
   in the baptism of all believers: Make disciples of all the nations,
   baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
   Holy Spirit. In the Gospel of Luke the angel Gabriel thus addressed
   Mary, the mother of our Lord: The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and
   the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; wherefore also the
   holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God. Likewise:
   The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
   communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. And (A.V.): There are
   three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
   Ghost: and these three are one.

   In all these places we are fully taught that there are three persons in
   one only divine essence. And although this doctrine far surpasses all
   human understanding, nevertheless we now believe it by means of the
   Word of God, but expect hereafter to enjoy the perfect knowledge and
   benefit thereof in heaven.

   Moreover, we must observe the particular offices and operations of
   these three persons towards us. The Father is called our Creator, by
   His power; the Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by His blood; the Holy
   Spirit is our Sanctifier, by His dwelling in our hearts.

   This doctrine of the Holy Trinity has always been affirmed and
   maintained by the true Church since the time of the apostles to this
   very day against the Jews, Mohammedans, and some false Christians and
   heretics, as Marcion, Manes, Praxeas, Sabellius, Samosatenus, Arius,
   and such like, who have been justly condemned by the orthodox fathers.
   Therefore, in this point, we do willingly receive the three creeds,
   namely, that of the Apostles, of Nicea, and of Athanasius; likewise
   that which, conformable thereunto, is agreed upon by the ancient
   fathers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article X

Jesus Christ Is True and Eternal God

   We believe that Jesus Christ according to His divine nature is the only
   begotten Son of God, begotten from eternity, not made, nor created (for
   then He would be a creature), but co-essential and co- eternal with the
   Father, the very image of his substance and the effulgence of his
   glory, equal unto Him in all things. He is the Son of God, not only
   from the time that He assumed our nature but from all eternity, as
   these testimonies, when compared together, teach us. Moses says that
   God created the world; and St. John says that all things were made by
   that Word which he calls God. The apostle says that God made the world
   by His Son; likewise, that God created all things by Jesus Christ.
   Therefore it must needs follow that He who is called God, the Word, the
   Son, and Jesus Christ, did exist at that time when all things were
   created by Him. Therefore the prophet Micah says: His goings forth are
   from of old, from everlasting. And the apostle: He hath neither
   beginning of days nor end of life. He therefore is that true, eternal,
   and almighty God whom we invoke, worship, and serve.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XI

The Holy Spirit Is True and Eternal God

   We believe and confess also that the Holy Spirit from eternity proceeds
   from the Father and the Son; and therefore neither is made, created,
   nor begotten, but only proceeds from both; who in order is the third
   person of the Holy Trinity; of one and the same essence, majesty, and
   glory with the Father and the Son; and therefore is the true and
   eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XII

The Creation of All Things, Especially the Angels

   We believe that the Father by the Word, that is, by His Son, has
   created of nothing the heaven, the earth, and all creatures, when it
   seemed good unto Him; giving unto every creature its being, shape,
   form, and several offices to serve its Creator; that He also still
   upholds and governs them by His eternal providence and infinite power
   for the service of mankind, to the end that man may serve his God.

   He also created the angels good, to be His messengers and to serve His
   elect; some of whom are fallen from that excellency in which God
   created them into everlasting perdition, and the others have by the
   grace of God remained steadfast and continued in their first state. The
   devils and evil spirits are so depraved that they are enemies of God
   and every good thing; to the utmost of their power as murderers
   watching to ruin the Church and every member thereof, and by their
   wicked stratagems to destroy all; and are, therefore, by their own
   wickedness adjudged to eternal damnation, daily expecting their
   horrible torments.

   Therefore we reject and abhor the error of the Sadducees, who deny the
   existence of spirits and angels; and also that of the Manichees, who
   assert that the devils have their origin of themselves, and that they
   are wicked of their own nature, without having been corrupted.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XIII

The Providence of God and His Government of All Things

   We believe that the same good God, after He had created all things, did
   not forsake them or give them up to fortune or chance, but that He
   rules and governs them according to His holy will, so that nothing
   happens in this world without His appointment; nevertheless, God
   neither is the Author of nor can be charged with the sins which are
   committed. For His power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible
   that He orders and executes His work in the most excellent and just
   manner, even when devils and wicked men act unjustly. And as to what He
   does surpassing human understanding, we will not curiously inquire into
   farther than our capacity will admit of; but with the greatest humility
   and reverence adore the righteous judgments of God, which are hid from
   us, contenting ourselves that we are pupils of Christ, to learn only
   those things which He has revealed to us in His Word, without
   transgressing these limits.

   This doctrine affords us unspeakable consolation, since we are taught
   thereby that nothing can befall us by chance, but by the direction of
   our most gracious and heavenly Father; who watches over us with a
   paternal care, keeping all creatures so under His power that not a hair
   of our head (for they are all numbered), nor a sparrow can fall to the
   ground without the will of our Father, in whom we do entirely trust;
   being persuaded that He so restrains the devil and all our enemies that
   without His will and permission they cannot hurt us.

   And therefore we reject that damnable error of the Epicureans, who say
   that God regards nothing but leaves all things to chance.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XIV

The Creation and Fall of Man, and His Incapacity to Perform What Is Truly Good

   We believe that God created man out of the dust of the earth, and made
   and formed him after His own image and likeness, good, righteous, and
   holy, capable in all things to will agreeably to the will of God. But
   being in honor, he understood it not, neither knew his excellency, but
   wilfully subjected himself to sin and consequently to death and the
   curse, giving ear to the words of the devil. For the commandment of
   life, which he had received, he transgressed; and by sin separated
   himself from God, who was his true life; having corrupted his whole
   nature; whereby he made himself liable to corporal and spiritual death.
   And being thus become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways, he
   has lost all his excellent gifts which he had received from God, and
   retained only small remains thereof, which, however, are sufficient to
   leave man without excuse; for all the light which is in us is changed
   into darkness, as the Scriptures teach us, saying: The light shineth in
   the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not; where St. John calls
   men darkness.

   Therefore we reject all that is taught repugnant to this concerning the
   free will of man, since man is but a slave to sin, and can receive
   nothing, except it have been given him from heaven. For who may presume
   to boast that he of himself can do any good, since Christ says: No man
   can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him? Who will glory
   in his own will, who understands that the mind of the flesh is enmity
   against God? Who can speak of his knowledge, since the natural man
   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God? In short, who dares
   suggest any thought, since he knows that we are not sufficient of
   ourselves to account anything as of ourselves, but that our sufficiency
   is of God? And therefore what the apostle says ought justly to be held
   sure and firm, that God worketh in us both to will and to work, for his
   good pleasure. For there is no understanding nor will conformable to
   the divine understanding and will but what Christ has wrought in man;
   which He teaches us, when He says: Apart from me ye can do nothing.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XV

Original Sin

   We believe that through the disobedience of Adam original sin is
   extended to all mankind; which is a corruption of the whole nature and
   a hereditary disease, wherewith even infants in their mothers womb are
   infected, and which produces in man all sorts of sin, being in him as a
   root thereof, and therefore is so vile and abominable in the sight of
   God that it is sufficient to condemn all mankind. Nor is it altogether
   abolished or wholly eradicated even by regeneration; since sin always
   issues forth from this woeful source, as water from a fountain;
   notwithstanding it is not imputed to the children of God unto
   condemnation, but by His grace and mercy is forgiven them. Not that
   they should rest securely in sin, but that a sense of this corruption
   should make believers often to sigh, desiring to be delivered from this
   body of death.

   Wherefore we reject the error of the Pelagians, who assert that sin
   proceeds only from imitation.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XVI

Eternal Election

   We believe that, all the posterity of Adam being thus fallen into
   perdition and ruin by the sin of our first parents, God then did
   manifest Himself such as He is; that is to say, merciful and just;
   merciful, since He delivers and preserves from this perdition all whom
   He in His eternal and unchangeable counsel of mere goodness has elected
   in Christ Jesus our Lord, without any respect to their works; just, in
   leaving others in the fall and perdition wherein they have involved
   themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XVII

The Recovery of Fallen Man

   We believe that our most gracious God, in His admirable wisdom and
   goodness, seeing that man had thus thrown himself into physical and
   spiritual death and made himself wholly miserable, was pleased to seek
   and comfort him, when he trembling fled from His presence, promising
   him that He would give His Son (who would be born of a woman) to bruise
   the head of the serpentand to make him blessed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XVIII

The Incarnation of Jesus Christ

   We confess, therefore, that God has fulfilled the promise which He made
   to the fathers by the mouth of His holy prophets, when He sent into the
   world, at the time appointed by Him, His own only- begotten and eternal
   Son, who took upon Him the form of a servant and became like unto man,
   really assuming the true human nature with all its infirmities, sin
   excepted; being conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary by the
   power of the Holy Spirit without the means of man; and did not only
   assume human nature as to the body, but also a true human soul, that He
   might be a real man. For since the soul was lost as well as the body,
   it was necessary that He should take both upon Him, to save both.

   Therefore we confess (in opposition to the heresy of the Anabaptists,
   who deny that Christ assumed human flesh of His mother) that Christ
   partook of the flesh and blood of the children; that He is a fruit of
   the loins of David after the flesh; born of the seed of David according
   to the flesh; a fruit of the womb of Mary; born of a woman; a branch of
   David; a shoot of the root of Jesse; sprung from the tribe of Judah;
   descended from the Jews according to the flesh; of the seed of Abraham,
   since (A.V.) he took on him the seed of Abraham, and was made like unto
   his brethren in all things, sin excepted; so that in truth He is our
   IMMANUEL, that is to say, God with us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XIX

The Union and Distinction of the Two Natures in the Person of Christ

   We believe that by this conception the person of the Son is inseparably
   united and connected with the human nature; so that there are not two
   Sons of God, nor two persons, but two natures united in one single
   person; yet each nature retains its own distinct properties. As, then,
   the divine nature has always remained uncreated, without beginning of
   days or end of life, filling heaven and earth, so also has the human
   nature not lost its properties but remained a creature, having
   beginning of days, being a finite nature, and retaining all the
   properties of a real body. And though He has by His resurrection given
   immortality to the same, nevertheless He has not changed the reality of
   His human nature; forasmuch as our salvation and resurrection also
   depend on the reality of His body. But these two natures are so closely
   united in one person that they were not separated even by His death.
   Therefore that which He, when dying, commended into the hands of His
   Father, was a real human spirit, departing from His body. But in the
   meantime the divine nature always remained united with the human, even
   when He lay in the grave; and the Godhead did not cease to be in Him,
   any more than it did when He was an infant, though it did not so
   clearly manifest itself for a while. Wherefore we confess that He is
   very God and very man: very God by His power to conquer death; and very
   man that He might die for us according to the infirmity of His flesh.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XX

God Has Manifested His Justice and Mercy in Christ

   We believe that God, who is perfectly merciful and just, sent His Son
   to assume that nature in which the disobedience was committed, to make
   satisfaction in the same, and to bear the punishment of sin by His most
   bitter passion and death. God therefore manifested His justice against
   His Son when He laid our iniquities upon Him, and poured forth His
   mercy and goodness on us, who were guilty and worthy of damnation, out
   of mere and perfect love, giving His Son unto death for us, and raising
   Him for our justification, that through Him we might obtain immortality
   and life eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXI

The Satisfaction of Christ, Our Only High Priest, for Us

   We believe that Jesus Christ is ordained with an oath to be an
   everlasting High Priest, after the order of Melchizedek; and that He
   has presented Himself in our behalf before the Father, to appease His
   wrath by His full satisfaction, by offering Himself on the tree of the
   cross, and pouring out His precious blood to purge away our sins, as
   the prophets had foretold. For it is written: He was wounded for our
   transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of
   our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. He was led
   as a lamb to the slaughter, and numbered with the transgressors; and
   condemned by Pontius Pilate as a malefactor, though he had first
   declared Him innocent. Therefore, He restored that which he took not
   away, and suffered, the righteous for the unrighteous, as well in His
   body as in His soul, feeling the terrible punishment which our sins had
   merited; insomuch that his sweat became as it were great drops of blood
   falling down upon the ground. He called out: My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me? and has suffered all this for the remission of our
   sins.

   Wherefore we justly say with the apostle Paul that we know nothing save
   Jesus Christ, and him crucified; we count all things but loss and
   refuse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, in
   whose wounds we find all manner of consolation. Neither is it necessary
   to seek or invent any other means of being reconciled to God than this
   only sacrifice, once offered, by which he hath perfected forever them
   that are sanctified. This is also the reason why He was called by the
   angel of God, JESUS, that is to say, SAVIOR, because He would save his
   people from their sins.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXII

Our Justification Through Faith in Jesus Christ

   We believe that, to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery,
   the Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces
   Jesus Christ with all His merits, appropriates Him, and seeks nothing
   more besides Him. For it must needs follow, either that all things
   which are requisite to our salvation are not in Jesus Christ, or if all
   things are in Him, that then those who possess Jesus Christ through
   faith have complete salvation in Him. Therefore, for any to assert that
   Christ is not sufficient, but that something more is required besides
   Him, would be too gross a blasphemy; for hence it would follow that
   Christ was but half a Savior.

   Therefore we justly say with Paul, that we are justified by faith
   alone, or by faith apart from works. However, to speak more clearly, we
   do not mean that faith itself justifies us, for it is only an
   instrument with which we embrace Christ our righteousness. But Jesus
   Christ, imputing to us all His merits, and so many holy works which He
   has done for us and in our stead, is our righteousness. And faith is an
   instrument that keeps us in communion with Him in all His benefits,
   which, when they become ours, are more than sufficient to acquit us of
   our sins.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXIII

Wherein Our Justification Before God Consists

   We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for
   Jesus Christ's sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is
   implied; as David and Paul teach us, declaring this to be the
   blessedness of man that God imputes righteousness to him apart from
   works. And the same apostle says that we are justified freely by his
   grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

   And therefore we always hold fast this foundation, ascribing all the
   glory to God, humbling ourselves before Him, and acknowledging
   ourselves to be such as we really are, without presuming to trust in
   anything in ourselves, or in any merit of ours, relying and resting
   upon the obedience of Christ crucified alone, which becomes ours when
   we believe in Him. This is sufficient to cover all our iniquities, and
   to give us confidence in approaching to God; freeing the conscience of
   fear, terror, and dread, without following the example of our first
   father, Adam, who, trembling, attempted to cover himself with
   fig-leaves. And, verily, if we should appear before God, relying on
   ourselves or on any other creature, though ever so little, we should,
   alas! be consumed. And therefore every one must pray with David: O
   Jehovah, enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight no
   man living is righteous.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXIV

Mans Sanctification and Good Works

   We believe that this true faith, being wrought in man by the hearing of
   the Word of God and the operation of the Holy Spirit, sanctifies him
   and makes him a new man, causing him to live a new life, and freeing
   him from the bondage of sin. Therefore it is so far from being true
   that this justifying faith makes men remiss in a pious and holy life,
   that on the contrary without it they would never do anything out of
   love to God, but only out of self-love or fear of damnation. Therefore
   it is impossible that this holy faith can be unfruitful in man; for we
   do not speak of a vain faith, but of such a faith which is called in
   Scripture a faith working through love, which excites man to the
   practice of those works which God has commanded in His Word.

   These works, as they proceed from the good root of faith, are good and
   acceptable in the sight of God, forasmuch as they are all sanctified by
   His grace. Nevertheless they are of no account towards our
   justification, for it is by faith in Christ that we are justified, even
   before we do good works; otherwise they could not be good works, any
   more than the fruit of a tree can be good before the tree itself is
   good.

   Therefore we do good works, but not to merit by them (for what can we
   merit?); nay, we are indebted to God for the good works we do, and not
   He to us, since it is He who worketh in us both to will and to work,
   for his good pleasure. Let us therefore attend to what is written: When
   ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are
   unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
   In the meantime we do not deny that God rewards good works, but it is
   through His grace that He crowns His gifts.

   Moreover, though we do good works, we do not found our salvation upon
   them; for we can do no work but what is polluted by our flesh, and also
   punishable; and although we could perform such works, still the
   remembrance of one sin is sufficient to make God reject them. Thus,
   then, we would always be in doubt, tossed to and fro without any
   certainty, and our poor consciences would be continually vexed if they
   relied not on the merits of the suffering and death of our Savior.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXV

The Abolishing of the Ceremonial Law

   We believe that the ceremonies and symbols of the law ceased at the
   coming of Christ, and that all the shadows are accomplished; so that
   the use of them must be abolished among Christians; yet the truth and
   substance of them remain with us in Jesus Christ, in whom they have
   their completion. In the meantime we still use the testimonies taken
   out of the law and the prophets to confirm us in the doctrine of the
   gospel, and to regulate our life in all honorableness to the glory of
   God, according to His will.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXVI

Christ's Intercession

   We believe that we have no access unto God but alone through the only
   Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous; who therefore became
   man, having united in one person the divine and human natures, that we
   men might have access to the divine Majesty, which access would
   otherwise be barred against us. But this Mediator, whom the Father has
   appointed between Him and us, ought in no wise to affright us by His
   majesty, or cause us to seek another according to our fancy. For there
   is no creature, either in heaven or on earth, who loves us more than
   Jesus Christ; who, though existing in the form of God, yet emptied
   himself, being made in the likeness of men and of a servant for us, and
   in all things was made like unto his brethren. If, then, we should seek
   for another mediator who would be favorably inclined towards us, whom
   could we find who loved us more than He who laid down His life for us,
   even while we were his enemies? And if we seek for one who has power
   and majesty, who is there that has so much of both as He who sits at
   the right hand of God and to whom hath been given all authority in
   heaven and on earth? And who will sooner be heard than the own well
   beloved Son of God?

   Therefore it was only through distrust that this practice of
   dishonoring, instead of honoring, the saints was introduced, doing that
   which they never have done nor required, but have on the contrary
   steadfastly rejected according to their bounden duty, as appears by
   their writings. Neither must we plead here our unworthiness; for the
   meaning is not that we should offer our prayers to God on the ground of
   our own worthiness, but only on the ground of the excellency and
   worthiness of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose righteousness is become ours
   by faith.

   Therefore the apostle, to remove this foolish fear, or rather distrust,
   from us, rightly says that Jesus Christ in all things was made like
   unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high
   priest, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that he
   himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are
   tempted. And further to encourage us to go to Him, he says: Having then
   a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son
   of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest
   that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one
   that hath been in all points tempted like aswe are, yet without sin.
   Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that
   we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.
   The same apostle says: Having boldness to enter into the holy place by
   the blood of Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of
   faith, etc. Likewise: Christ hath his priesthood unchangeable;
   wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near
   unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
   them.

   What more can be required? since Christ Himself says: I am the way, and
   the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me. To
   what purpose should we, then, seek another advocate, since it has
   pleased God to give us His own Son as an Advocate? Let us not forsake
   Him to take another, or rather to seek after another, without ever
   being able to find him; for God well knew, when He gave Him to us, that
   we were sinners.

   Therefore, according to the command of Christ, we call upon the
   heavenly Father through Jesus Christ our only Mediator, as we are
   taught in the Lords Prayer; being assured that whatever we ask of the
   Father in His Name will be granted us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXVII

The Catholic Christian Church

   We believe and profess one catholic or universal Church, which is a
   holy congregation of true Christian believers, all expecting their
   salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed by His blood, sanctified and
   sealed by the Holy Spirit.

   This Church has been from the beginning of the world, and will be to
   the end thereof; which is evident from this that Christ is an eternal
   King, which without subjects He cannot be. And this holy Church is
   preserved or supported by God against the rage of the whole world;
   though it sometimes for a while appears very small, and in the eyes of
   men to be reduced to nothing; as during the perilous reign of Ahab the
   Lord reserved unto Him seven thousand men who had not bowed their knees
   to Baal.

   Furthermore, this holy Church is not confined, bound, or limited to a
   certain place or to certain persons, but is spread and dispersed over
   the whole world; and yet is joined and united with heart and will, by
   the power of faith, in one and the same Spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXVIII

Every One Is Bound to Join Himself to the True Church

   We believe, since this holy congregation is an assembly of those who
   are saved, and outside of it there is no salvation, that no person of
   whatsoever state or condition he may be, ought to withdraw from it,
   content to be by himself; but that all men are in duty bound to join
   and unite themselves with it; maintaining the unity of the Church;
   submitting themselves to the doctrine and discipline thereof; bowing
   their necks under the yoke of Jesus Christ; and as mutual members of
   the same body, serving to the edification of the brethren, according to
   the talents God has given them.

   And that this may be the more effectually observed, it is the duty of
   all believers, according to the Word of God, to separate themselves
   from all those who do not belong to the Church, and to join themselves
   to this congregation, wheresoever God has established it, even though
   the magistrates and edicts of princes were against it, yea, though they
   should suffer death or any other corporal punishment. Therefore all
   those who separate themselves from the same or do not join themselves
   to it act contrary to the ordinance of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXIX

The Marks of the True Church, and Wherein it Differs from the False Church

   We believe that we ought diligently and circumspectly to discern from
   the Word of God which is the true Church, since all sects which are in
   the world assume to themselves the name of the Church. But we speak not
   here of hypocrites, who are mixed in the Church with the good, yet are
   not of the Church, though externally in it; but we say that the body
   and communion of the true Church must be distinguished from all sects
   that call themselves the Church.

   The marks by which the true Church is known are these: If the pure
   doctrine of the gospel is preached therein; if it maintains the pure
   administration of the sacraments as instituted by Christ; if church
   discipline is exercised in chastening of sin; in short, if all things
   are managed according to the pure Word of God, all things contrary
   thereto rejected, and Jesus Christ acknowledged as the only Head of the
   Church. Hereby the true Church may certainly be known, from which no
   man has a right to separate himself.

   With respect to those who are members of the Church, they may be known
   by the marks of Christians; namely, by faith, and when, having received
   Jesus Christ the only Savior, they avoid sin, follow after
   righteousness, love the true God and their neighbor, neither turn aside
   to the right or left, and crucify the flesh with the works thereof. But
   this is not to be understood as if there did not remain in them great
   infirmities; but they fight against them through the Spirit all the
   days of their life, continually taking their refuge in the blood,
   death, passion, and obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom they
   have remission of sins, through faith in Him.

   As for the false Church, it ascribes more power and authority to itself
   and its ordinances than to the Word of God, and will not submit itself
   to the yoke of Christ. Neither does it administer the sacra ments as
   appointed by Christ in His Word, but adds to and takes from them, as it
   thinks proper; it relies more upon men than upon Christ; and persecutes
   those who live holily according to the Word of God and rebuke it for
   its errors, covetousness, and idolatry.

   These two Churches are easily known and distinguished from each other.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXX

The Government of the Church and its Offices

   We believe that this true Church must be governed by that spiritual
   polity which our Lord has taught us in His Word; namely, that there
   must be ministers or pastors to preach the Word of God and to
   administer the sacraments; also elders and deacons, who, together with
   the pastors, form the council of the Church; that by these means the
   true religion may be preserved, and the true doctrine everywhere
   propagated, likewise transgressors chastened and restrained by
   spiritual means; also that the poor and distressed may be relieved and
   comforted, according to their necessities. By these means everything
   will be carried on in the Church with good order and decency, when
   faithful men are chosen, according to the rule prescribed by St. Paul
   in his Epistle to Timothy.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXI

The Ministers, Elders, and Deacons

   We believe that the ministers of Gods Word, the elders, and the deacons
   ought to be chosen to their respective offices by a lawful election by
   the Church, with calling upon the name of the Lord, and in that order
   which the Word of God teaches. Therefore every one must take heed not
   to intrude himself by improper means, but is bound to wait till it
   shall please God to call him; that he may have testimony of his
   calling, and be certain and assured that it is of the Lord.

   As for the ministers of Gods Word, they have equally the same power and
   authority wheresoever they are, as they are all ministers of Christ,
   the only universal Bishop and the only Head of the Church.

   Moreover, in order that this holy ordinance of God may not be violated
   or slighted, we say that every one ought to esteem the ministers of
   Gods Word and the elders of the Church very highly for their works
   sake, and be at peace with them without murmuring, strife, or
   contention, as much as possible.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXII

The Order and Discipline of the Church

   In the meantime we believe, though it is useful and beneficial that
   those who are rulers of the Church institute and establish certain
   ordinances among themselves for maintaining the body of the Church, yet
   that they ought studiously to take care that they do not depart from
   those things which Christ, our only Master, has instituted. And
   therefore we reject all human inventions, and all laws which man would
   introduce into the worship of God, thereby to bind and compel the
   conscience in any manner whatever. Therefore we admit only of that
   which tends to nourish and preserve concord and unity, and to keep all
   men in obedience to God. For this purpose, excommunication or church
   discipline is requisite, with all that pertains to it, according to the
   Word of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXIII

The Sacraments

   We believe that our gracious God, taking account of our weakness and
   infirmities, has ordained the sacraments for us, thereby to seal unto
   us His promises, and to be pledges of the good will and grace of God
   towards us, and also to nourish and strengthen our faith; which He has
   joined to the Word of the gospel, the better to present to our senses
   both that which He declares to us by His Word and that which He works
   inwardly in our hearts, thereby confirming in us the salvation which He
   imparts to us. For they are visible signs and seals of an inward and
   invisible thing, by means whereof God works in us by the power of the
   Holy Spirit. Therefore the signs are not empty or meaningless, so as to
   deceive us. For Jesus Christ is the true object presented by them,
   without whom they would be of no moment.

   Moreover, we are satisfied with the number of sacraments which Christ
   our Lord has instituted, which are two only, namely, the sacrament of
   baptism and the holy supper of our Lord Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXIV

Holy Baptism

   We believe and confess that Jesus Christ, who is the end of the law,
   has made an end, by the shedding of His blood, of all other sheddings
   of blood which men could or would make as a propitiation or
   satisfaction for sin; and that He, having abolished circumcision, which
   was done with blood, has instituted the sacrament of baptism instead
   thereof; by which we are received into the Church of God, and separated
   from all other people and strange religions, that we may wholly belong
   to Him whose mark and ensign we bear; and which serves as a testimony
   to us that He will forever be our gracious God and Father.

   Therefore He has commanded all those who are His to be baptized with
   pure water, into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
   Spirit , thereby signifying to us, that as water washes away the filth
   of the body when poured upon it, and is seen on the body of the
   baptized when sprinkled upon him, so does the blood of Christ by the
   power of the Holy Spirit internally sprinkle the soul, cleanse it from
   its sins, and regenerate us from children of wrath unto children of
   God. Not that this is effected by the external water, but by the
   sprinkling of the precious blood of the Son of God; who is our Red Sea,
   through which we must pass to escape the tyranny of Pharaoh, that is,
   the devil, and to enter into the spiritual land of Canaan.

   The ministers, therefore, on their part administer the sacrament and
   that which is visible, but our Lord gives that which is signified by
   the sacrament, namely, the gifts and invisible grace; washing,
   cleansing, and purging our souls of all filth and unrighteousness;
   renewing our hearts and filling them with all comfort; giving unto us a
   true assurance of His fatherly goodness; putting on us the new man, and
   putting off the old man with all his deeds.

   We believe, therefore, that every man who is earnestly studious of
   obtaining life eternal ought to be baptized but once with this only
   baptism, without ever repeating the same, since we cannot be born
   twice. Neither does this baptism avail us only at the time when the
   water is poured upon us and received by us, but also through the whole
   course of our life.

   Therefore we detest the error of the Anabaptists, who are not content
   with the one only baptism they have once received, and moreover condemn
   the baptism of the infants of believers, who we believe ought to be
   baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as the children in
   Israel formerly were circumcised upon the same promises which are made
   unto our children. And indeed Christ shed His blood no less for the
   washing of the children of believers than for adult persons; and
   therefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament of that which
   Christ has done for them; as the Lord commanded in the law that they
   should be made partakers of the sacrament of Christ's suffering and
   death shortly after they were born, by offering for them a lamb, which
   was a sacrament of Jesus Christ. Moreover, what circumcision was to the
   Jews, baptism is to our children. And for this reason St. Paul calls
   baptism the circumcision of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXV

The Holy Supper of Our Lord Jesus Christ

   We believe and confess that our Savior Jesus Christ did ordain and
   institute the sacrament of the holy supper to nourish and support those
   whom He has already regenerated and incorporated into His family, which
   is His Church.

   Now those who are regenerated have in them a twofold life, the one
   corporal and temporal, which they have from the first birth and is
   common to all men; the other, spiritual and heavenly, which is given
   them in their second birth, which is effected by the Word of the
   gospel, in the communion of the body of Christ; and this life is not
   common, but is peculiar to Gods elect. In like manner God has given us,
   for the support of the bodily and earthly life, earthly and common
   bread, which is subservient thereto and is common to all men, even as
   life itself. But for the support of the spiritual and heavenly life
   which believers have He has sent a living bread, which descended from
   heaven, namely, Jesus Christ, who nourishes and strengthens the
   spiritual life of believers when they eat Him, that is to say, when
   they appropriate and receive Him by faith in the spirit.

   In order that He might represent unto us this spiritual and heavenly
   bread, Christ has instituted an earthly and visible bread as a
   sacrament of His body, and wine as a sacrament of His blood, to testify
   by them unto us that, as certainly as we receive and hold this
   sacrament in our hands and eat and drink the same with our mouths, by
   which our life is afterwards nourished, we also do as certainly receive
   by faith (which is the hand and mouth of our soul) the true body and
   blood of Christ our only Savior in our souls, for the support of our
   spiritual life.

   Now, as it is certain and beyond all doubt that Jesus Christ has not
   enjoined to us the use of His sacraments in vain, so He works in us all
   that He represents to us by these holy signs, though the manner
   surpasses our understanding and cannot be comprehended by us, as the
   operations of the Holy Spirit are hidden and incomprehensible. In the
   meantime we err not when we say that what is eaten and drunk by us is
   the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ. But the
   manner of our partaking of the same is not by the mouth, but by the
   spirit through faith. Thus, then, though Christ always sits at the
   right hand of His Father in the heavens, yet does He not therefore
   cease to make us partakers of Himself by faith. This feast is a
   spiritual table, at which Christ communicates Himself with all His
   benefits to us, and gives us there to enjoy both Himself and the merits
   of His sufferings and death: nourishing, strengthening, and comforting
   our poor comfortless souls by the eating of His flesh, quickening and
   refreshing them by the drinking of His blood.

   Further, though the sacraments are connected with the thing signified
   nevertheless both are not received by all men. The ungodly indeed
   receives the sacrament to his condemnation, but he does not receive the
   truth of the sacrament, even as Judas and Simon the sorcerer both
   indeed received the sacrament but not Christ who was signified by it,
   of whom believers only are made partakers.

   Lastly, we receive this holy sacrament in the assembly of the people of
   God, with humility and reverence, keeping up among us a holy
   remembrance of the death of Christ our Savior, with thanksgiving,
   making there confession of our faith and of the Christian religion.
   Therefore no one ought to come to this table without having previously
   rightly examined himself, lest by eating of this bread and drinking of
   this cup he eat and drink judgment to himself. In a word, we are moved
   by the use of this holy sacrament to a fervent love towards God and our
   neighbor.

   Therefore we reject all mixtures and damnable inventions which men have
   added unto and blended with the sacraments, as profanations of them;
   and affirm that we ought to rest satisfied with the ordinance which
   Christ and His apostles have taught us, and that we must speak of them
   in the same manner as they have spoken.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXVI

The Magistracy (Civil Government)

   We believe that our gracious God, because of the depravity of mankind,
   has appointed kings, princes, and magistrates; willing that the world
   should be governed by certain laws and policies; to the end that the
   dissoluteness of men might be restrained, and all things carried on
   among them with good order and decency. For this purpose He has
   invested the magistracy with the sword for the punishment of evil-doers
   and for the protection of them that do well .

   Their office is not only to have regard unto and watch for the welfare
   of the civil state, but also to protect the sacred ministry, that the
   kingdom of Christ may thus be promoted. They must therefore countenance
   the preaching of the Word of the gospel everywhere, that God may be
   honored and worshipped by every one, as He commands in His Word.

   Moreover, it is the bounden duty of every one, of whatever state,
   quality, or condition he may be, to subject himself to the magistrates;
   to pay tribute, to show due honor and respect to them, and to obey them
   in all things which are not repugnant to the Word of God; to supplicate
   for them in their prayers that God may rule and guide them in all their
   ways, and that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness
   and gravity.

   Wherefore we detest the Anabaptists and other seditious people, and in
   general all those who reject the higher powers and magistrates and
   would subvert justice, introduce community of goods, and confound that
   decency and good order which God has established among men.
     __________________________________________________________________

Article XXXVII

The Last Judgment

   Finally, we believe, according to the Word of God, when the time
   appointed by the Lord (which is unknown to all creatures) is come and
   the number of the elect complete, that our Lord Jesus Christ will come
   from heaven, corporally and visibly, as He ascended, with great glory
   and majesty to declare Himself Judge of the living and the dead,
   burning this old world with fire and flame to cleanse it.

   Then all men will personally appear before this great Judge, both men
   and women and children, that have been from the beginning of the world
   to the end thereof, being summoned by the voice of the archangel, and
   by the sound of the trump of God. For all the dead shall be raised out
   of the earth, and their souls joined and united with their proper
   bodies in which they formerly lived. As for those who shall then be
   living, they shall not die as the others, but be changed in the
   twinkling of an eye, and from corruptible become incorruptible. Then
   the books shall be opened, and the dead judged according to what they
   shall have done in this world, whether it be good or evil. Nay, all men
   shall give account of every idle word they have spoken , which the
   world only counts amusement and jest; and then the secrets and
   hypocrisy of men shall be disclosed and laid open before all.

   And therefore the consideration of this judgment is justly terrible and
   dreadful to the wicked and ungodly, but most desirable and comfortable
   to the righteous and elect; because then their full deliver ance shall
   be perfected, and there they shall receive the fruits of their labor
   and trouble which they have borne. Their innocence shall be known to
   all, and they shall see the terrible vengeance which God shall execute
   on the wicked, who most cruelly persecuted, oppressed, and tormented
   them in this world, and who shall be convicted by the testimony of
   their own consciences, and shall become immortal, but only to be
   tormented in the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his
   angels.

   But on the contrary, the faithful and elect shall be crowned with glory
   and honor; and the Son of God will confess their names before God His
   Father and His elect angels; all tears shall be wiped from their eyes;
   and their cause which is now condemned by many judges and magistrates
   as heretical and impious will then be known to be the cause of the Son
   of God. And for a gracious reward, the Lord will cause them to possess
   such a glory as never entered into the heart of man to conceive.

   Therefore we expect that great day with a most ardent desire, to the
   end that we may fully enjoy the promises of God in Christ Jesus our
   Lord. AMEN. Amen, come, Lord Jesus. Rev. 22:20 .
