PREFACE

  WILLIAM BROWN

   Of this work as published by the Author, the following was the title:
   Gildas Salvianus: The Reformed Pastor, showing the nature of the
   Pastoral work; especially in Private Instruction and Catechizing; with
   an open CONFESSION of our too open SINS: Prepared for a Day of
   Humiliation kept at Worcester, December 4, 1655, by the Ministers of
   that County, who subscribed the Agreement for Catechizing and Personal
   Instruction at their entrance upon that work, By their unworthy fellow
   Servant, Richard Baxter, Teacher of the Church at Kederminster.'

   Of the excellence of this work, it is scarcely possible to speak in too
   high terms. It is not a directory relative to the various parts of the
   ministerial office, and in this respect it may, by some, be considered
   as defective; but, for powerful, pathetic, pungent, heartpiercing
   address, we know of no work on the pastoral office to be compared with
   it. Could we suppose it to be read by an angel, or by some other being
   possessed of an unfallen nature, the reasonings and expostulations of
   our author would be felt to be altogether irresistible; and hard must
   be the heart of that minister, who can read it without being moved,
   melted, and overwhelmed, under a sense of his own shortcomings; hard
   must be his heart, if he be not mused to greater faithfulness,
   diligence, and activity in winning souls to Christ. It is a work worthy
   of being printed in letters of gold: it deserves, at least, to be
   engraven on the heart of every minister.

   But, with all its excellencies, the Reformed Pastor,' as originally
   published by our author, labors under considerable defects, especially
   as regards its usefulness in the present day. With the view of
   remedying the imperfections of the original work, the Rev Samuel
   Palmer, of Hackney, published, in 1766, an Abridgement of it; but
   though it was scarcely possible to present the work in any form,
   without furnishing powerful and impressive appeals to the consciences
   of ministers, he essentially failed in presenting it in an improved
   form. In fact, the work in its original state was, with all its faults,
   greatly to be preferred to Palmer's abridgement of it: if the latter
   was freed from some of its defects, it also lost much of its
   excellence. We may often, with advantage, throw out extraneous matter
   from the writings of Baxter; but there are few men's works which less
   admit of abridgement. This sacrifices their fullness and richness of
   illustration, enervates their energy, and evaporates their power and
   pathos.

   The work which is now presented to the public, is not, strictly
   speaking, an abridgement. Though considerably less than the original,
   it has been reduced in size, chiefly by the omission of extraneous and
   controversial matter, which, however useful it might be when the work
   was originally published, is for the most part inapplicable to the
   circumstances of the present age. I have also in some instances changed
   the order of particular parts. The Motives to the Oversight of the
   Flock,' which our author had placed in his Application, I have
   introduced in that part of the discourse to which they refer, just as
   we have Motives to the Oversight of Ourselves,' in the preceding part
   of the treatise. Some of the particulars which he has under the head of
   Motives, I have introduced in other parts of the body of the discourse,
   to which they appeared more naturally to belong. But though I have used
   some freedom in the way of transposition, I have been anxious not to
   sacrifice the force and fullness of our author's illustrations to mere
   logical arrangement. Many of the same topics, for instance, are still
   retained in the Application, which had occurred in the body of the
   discourse, and are there touched with a master's hand, but which would
   have lost much of their appropriateness and energy, had I separated
   them from that particular connection in which they stand, and
   introduced them in a different part of the work. I have also corrected
   the language of our author; but I have been solicitous not to modernise
   it. Though to adopt the phraseology and forms of speech employed by the
   writers of that age, would be a piece of silly affectation in an author
   of the present day, yet there is something simple, venerable, and
   impressive in it, as used by the writers themselves.

   While, however, I have made these changes from the original, I trust I
   have not injured, but on the contrary, improved the work; that the
   spirit of its great author is so much preserved, that those who are
   most familiar with his writings would scarcely be sensible of the
   alterations I have made, had I not stated them in this place. Before I
   conclude, I cannot help suggesting to the friends of religion, that
   they could not perhaps do more good at less expense, than by presenting
   copies of this work to the ministers of Christ throughout the country.
   There is no class of the community on whom the prosperity of the church
   of Christ so much depends as on its ministers. If their zeal and
   activity languish, the interests of religion are likely to languish in
   proportion; while, on the other hand, whatever is calculated to
   stimulate their zeal and activity, is likely to promote, in a
   proportional degree, the interests of religion. They are the chief
   instruments through whom good is to be effected in any country. How
   important, then, must it be to stir them up to holy zeal and activity
   in the cause of the Redeemer! A tract given to a poor man may be the
   means of his conversion; but a work such as this, presented to a
   minister, may, through his increased faithfulness and energy, prove the
   conversion of multitudes. Ministers themselves are not perhaps
   sufficiently disposed to purchase works of this kind: they are more
   ready to purchase books which will assist them, than such as will
   stimulate them in their work. If, therefore, any plan could be devised
   for presenting a copy of it to every minister of the various
   denominations throughout the United Kingdom, what incalculable good
   might be effected! There are many individuals to whom it would be no
   great burden to purchase twenty, fifty, or a hundred copies of such a
   work as this, and to send it to ministers in different parts of the
   country; or several individuals might unite together for this purpose.
   I can scarcely conceive any way in which they would be likely to be
   more useful. To the different Missionary Societies, I trust I may be
   allowed to make a similar suggestion. To furnish every missionary, or
   at least every Missionary Station, with a copy of the Reformed Pastor,
   would, I doubt not, be a powerful means of promoting the grand object
   of Christian Missions. Sure I am of this, there is no work so much
   calculated to stimulate a missionary to holy zeal and activity in his
   evangelistic labors.

DEDICATION

   To my bretheren and dearly-beloved brethren, the faithful ministers of
   Christ, in Britain and Ireland, Grace and Peace in Jesus Christ be
   increase

  REVEREND BRETHREN

   The subject of this treatise so nearly concerneth yourselves, and the
   churches committed to your care, that it emboldeneth me to this
   address, notwithstanding the imperfections in the manner of handling
   it, and the consciousness of my great unworthiness to be your monitor.

   Before I come to my principal errand, I shall give you an account of
   the reasons of the following work, and of the freedom of speech I have
   used, which to some may be displeasing. When the Lord had awakened his
   ministers in the county of Worcestershire, and some neighboring parts,
   to a sense of their duty in the work of catechizing, and private
   instruction of all in their parishes who would not obstinately refuse
   their help, and when they had subscribed an agreement, containing their
   resolutions for the future performance of it, they judged it unmeet to
   enter upon the work, without a solemn humbling of their souls before
   the Lord, for their long neglect of so great and necessary a duty; and,
   therefore, they agreed to meet together at Worcester, December 4, 1655,
   and there to join in humiliation and in earnest prayer to God, for the
   pardon of our neglects, and for his special assistance in the work
   which we had undertaken, and for the success of it with the people whom
   we had engaged to instruct; at which time, among others, I was desired
   by them to preach. In compliance with their wishes, I prepared the
   following Discourse; which, though it proved longer than could be
   delivered in one or two sermons, yet I intended to have entered upon it
   at that time, and to have delivered that which was most pertinent to
   the occasion, and to have reserved the rest to another season. But,
   before the meeting, by the increase of my ordinary pain and weakness, I
   was disabled from going thither; to recompense which unwilling
   omission, I easily yielded to the request of divers of the brethren,
   forthwith to publish the things which I had prepared, that they might
   read that which they could not hear. If it be objected, that I should
   not have spoken so plainly and sharply against the sins of the
   ministry, or that I should not have published it to the view of the
   world; or, at least, that I should have done it in another tongue, and
   not in the ears of the vulgar; especially, at such a time, when Quakers
   and Papists are endeavoring to bring the ministry into contempt, and
   the people are too prone to hearken to their suggestions -- I confess I
   thought the objection very considerable; but that it prevailed not to
   alter my resolution, is to be ascribed, among others, to the following
   reasons:

   1. It was a proposed solemn humiliation that we agreed on, and that
   this was prepared and intended for. And how should we be humbled
   without a plain confession of our sin? 2. It was principally our own
   sins that the confession did concern; and who can be offended with us
   for confessing our own sins, and taking the blame and shame to
   ourselves, which our consciences told us we ought to do? 3. Having
   necessarily prepared it in the English tongue, I had no spare time to
   translate it into Latin. 4. When the sin is open in the sight of the
   world, it is vain to attempt to hide it; all such attempts will but
   aggravate and increase our shame. 5. A free confession is a condition
   of a full remission; and when the sin is public, the confession should
   also be public.

   If the ministers of England had sinned only in Latin, I would have made
   shift to admonish them in Latin, or else have said nothing to them. But
   if they will sin in English, they must hear of it in English.
   Unpardoned sin will never let us rest or prosper, though we be at ever
   so much care and cost to cover it: our sin will surely find us out,
   though we find not it out. The work of confession is purposely to make
   known our sin, and freely to take the shame to ourselves; and if he
   that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall have mercy,' no wonder if
   he that covereth them shall not prosper.' If we be so tender of
   ourselves, and so loath to confess, God will be the less tender of us,
   and he will indite our confessions for us. He will either force our
   consciences to confession, or his judgments shall proclaim our
   iniquities to the world.

   6. Too many who have undertaken the work of the ministry do so
   obstinately proceed in self-seeking, negligence, pride, and other sins,
   that it is become our necessary duty to admonish them. If we saw that
   such would reform without reproof, we would gladly forbear the
   publishing of their faults. But when reproofs themselves prove so
   ineffectual, that they are more offended at the reproof than at the
   sin, and had rather that we should cease reproving than that themselves
   should cease sinning, I think it is time to sharpen the remedy. For
   what else should we do? To give up our brethren as incurable were
   cruelty, as long as there are further means to he used.

   We must not hate them, but plainly rebuke them, and not suffer sin upon
   them. To bear with the vices of the ministry is to promote the ruin of
   the Church; for what speedier way is there for the depraving and
   undoing of the people, than the depravity of their guides? And how can
   we more effectually further a reformation, than by endeavoring to
   reform the leaders of the Church? For my part, I have done as I would
   be done by; and it is for the safety of the Church, and in tender love
   to the brethren, whom I venture to reprehend -- not to make them
   contemptible and odious, but to heal the evils that would make them so
   -- that so no enemy may find this matter of reproach among us. But,
   especially, because our faithful endeavors are of so great necessity to
   the welfare of the Church, and the saving of men's souls, that it will
   not consist with a love to either, to be negligent ourselves, or
   silently to connive at negligence in others. If thousands of you were
   in a leaking ship, and those that should pump out the water, and stop
   the leaks, should be sporting or asleep, or even but favoring
   themselves in their labors, to the hazarding of you all, would you not
   awaken them to their work and call on them to labor as for your lives?
   And if you used some sharpness and importunity with the slothful, would
   you think that man was in his wits who would take it ill of you, and
   accuse you of pride, selfconceitedness, or unmannerliness, to presume
   to talk so saucily to your fellow-workmen, or that should tell you that
   you wrong them by diminishing their reputation? Would you not say, The
   work must be done, or we are all dead men. Is the ship ready to sink,
   and do you talk of reputation? or had you rather hazard yourself and
   us, than hear of your slothfullness?' This is our case, brethren, The
   work of God must needs be done! Souls must not perish, while you mind
   your worldly business or worldly pleasure, and take your ease, or
   quarrel with your brethren! Nor must we be silent while men are
   hastened by you to perdition, and the Church brought into greater
   danger and confusion, for fear of seeming too uncivil and unmannerly
   with you, or displeasing your impatient souls! Would you be but as
   impatient with your sins as with our reproofs, you should hear no more
   from us, but we should be all agreed! But, neither God nor good men
   will let you alone in such sins. Yet if you had betaken yourselves to
   another calling, and would sin to yourselves only, and would perish
   alone, we should not have so much necessity of molesting you, as now we
   have: but if you will enter into the office of the ministry, which is
   for the necessary preservation of us all, so that by letting you alone
   in your sin, we must give up the Church to loss and hazard, blame us
   not if we talk to you more freely than you would have us to do. If your
   own body were sick, and you will despise the remedy, or if your own
   house were on fire, and you will be singing or quarrelling in the
   streets, I could possibly bear it, and let you alone, (which yet, in
   charity, I should not easily do,) but, if you will undertake to be the
   physician of an hospital, or to a whole town that is infected with the
   plague, or will undertake to quench all the fires that shall be kindled
   in the town, there is no bearing with your remissness, how much soever
   it may displease you. Take it how you will, you must be told of it; and
   if that will not serve, you must be told of it yet more plainly; and,
   if that will not serve, if you be rejected as well as reprehended, you
   may thank yourselves. I speak all this to none but the guilty.

   And, thus, I have given you those reasons which forced me to publish,
   in plain English, so much of the sins of the ministry as in the
   following Treatise I have done. And I suppose the more penitent and
   humble any are, and the more desirous of the true reformation of the
   Church, the more easily and fully will they approve such free
   confessions and reprehensions. But I find it will be impossible to
   avoid offending those who are at once guilty and impenitent; for there
   is no way of avoiding this, but by our silence, or their patience: and
   silent we cannot be, because of God's commands; and patient they will
   not be, because of their guilt and impenitence. But plain dealers will
   always be approved in the end; and the time is at hand when you will
   confess that they were your best friends. But my principal business is
   yet behind. I must now take the boldness, brethren, to become your
   monitor, concerning some of the necessary duties, of which I have
   spoken in the ensuing discourse. If any of you should charge me with
   arrogance or immodesty for this attempt, as if hereby I accused you of
   negligence, or judged myself sufficient to admonish you, I crave your
   candid interpretation of my boldness, assuring you that I obey not the
   counsel of my flesh herein, but displease myself as much as some of
   you; and would rather have the ease and peace of silence, if it would
   stand with my duty, and the churches' good. But it is the mere
   necessity of the souls of men, and my desire of their salvation, and of
   the prosperity of the Church, which forceth me to this arrogance and
   immodesty, if so it must be called. For who, that hath a tongue, can be
   silent, when it is for the honor of God, the welfare of his Church, and
   the everlasting happiness of so many souls?

   The first, and main point, which I have to propound to you, is this,
   Whether it be not the unquestionable duty of the generality of
   ministers of these three nations, to set themselves presently to the
   work of catechizing, and instructing individually, all that are
   committed to their care, who will be persuaded to submit thereunto? I
   need not here stand to prove it, having sufficiently done this in the
   following discourse. Can you think that holy wisdom will gainsay it?
   Will zeal for God; will delight in his service, or love to the souls of
   men, gainsay it

   1. That people must be taught the principles of religion, and matters
   of greatest necessity to salvation, is past doubt among us.

   2. That they must be taught it in the most edifying, advantageous way,
   I hope we are agreed.

   3. That personal conference, and examination, and instruction, hath
   many excellent advantages for their good, is no less beyond dispute.

   4. That personal instruction is recommended to us by Scripture, and by
   the practice of the servants of Christ, and approved by the godly of
   all ages, is, so far as I can find, without contradiction.

   5. It is past doubt, that we should perform this great duty to all the
   people, or as many as we can; for our love and care of their souls must
   extend to all. If there are five hundred or a thousand ignorant people
   in your parish or congregation, it is a poor discharge of your duty,
   now and then to speak to some few of them, and to let the rest alone in
   their ignorance, if you are able to afford them help.

   6. It is no less certain, that so great a work as this is should take
   up a considerable part of our time. Lastly, it is equally certain that
   all duties should be done in order, as far as may be, and therefore
   should have their appointed times. And if we are agreed to practice,
   according to these commonly acknowledged truths, we need not differ
   upon any doubtful circumstances.

   I do now, in the behalf of Christ, and for the sake of his Church, and
   the immortal souls of men, beseech all the faithful ministers of
   Christ, that they will presently and effectually fall upon this work.
   Combine for the unanimous performance of it, that it may more easily
   procure the submission of your people. I must confess, I find, by some
   experience, that this is the work that, through the grace of God, which
   worketh by means, must reform indeed; that must expel our common
   prevailing ignorance; that must bow the stubborn hearts of sinners;
   that must answer their vain objections, and take off their prejudices;
   that must reconcile their hearts to faithful ministers, and help on the
   success of our public preaching; and make true godliness a commoner
   thing than it has hitherto been. I find that we never took the best
   course for demolishing the kingdom of darkness, till now. I wonder at
   myself, how I was so long kept off from so clear and excellent a duty.
   But the case was with me, as I suppose it is with others. I was long
   convinced of it, but my apprehensions of the difficulties were too
   great, and my apprehensions of the duty too small, and so I was long
   hindered from the performance of it. I imagined the people would scorn
   it, and none but a few, who had least need, would submit to it, and I
   thought my strength would never go through with it, having so great
   burdens on me before; and thus I long delayed it, which I beseech the
   Lord of mercy to forgive. Whereas, upon trial, I find the difficulties
   almost nothing (save only through my extraordinary bodily weakness) to
   that which I imagined; and I find the benefits and comforts of the work
   to be such, that I would not wish I had forborne it, for all the riches
   in the world. We spend Monday and Tuesday, from morning almost to
   night, in the work, taking about fifteen or sixteen families in a week,
   that we may go through the parish, in which there are upwards of eight
   hundred families, in a year; and I cannot say yet that one family hath
   refused to come to me, and but few persons excused themselves, and
   shifted it off. And I find more outward signs of success with most that
   do come, than from all my public preaching to them. If you say, It is
   not so in most places, I answer, I wish that the blame of this may not
   lie much with ourselves. If, however, some refuse your help, that will
   not excuse you for not affording it to them that would accept of it. If
   you ask me what course I take for order and expedition, I may here
   mention, that, at the delivery of the Catechisms, I take a catalogue of
   all the persons of understanding in the parish, and the clerk goeth a
   week before, to every family, to tell them what day to come, and at
   what hour, (one family at eight o'clock, the next at nine, and the next
   at ten, etc.) And I am forced by the number to deal with a whole family
   at once; but ordinarily I admit not any of another family to be
   present. Brethren, do I now invite you to this work, without the
   authority of God, without the consent of all antiquity, without the
   consent of the Reformed Divines, or without the conviction of your own
   consciences? See what the Westminster Assembly speak occasionally in
   the Directory, about the visitation of the sick: It is the duty of the
   minister not only to teach the people committed to his charge in
   public, but privately, and particularly to admonish, exhort, reprove,
   and comfort them upon all seasonable occasions, so far as his time,
   strength, and personal safety will permit. He is to admonish them in
   time of health to prepare for death. And for that purpose, they are
   often to confer with their minister about the estate of their souls,'
   etc. Read this over again, and consider it. Hearken to God, if you
   would have peace with God. Hearken to conscience, if you would have
   peace of conscience. I am resolved to deal plainly with you, though I
   should displease you. It is an unlikely thing that there should be a
   heart sincerely devoted to God in that man, who, after advertisements
   and exhortations, will not resolve on so clear and great a duty. I
   cannot conceive that he who hath one spark of saving grace, and so hath
   that love to God, and delight to do his will, which is in all the
   sanctified, could possibly be drawn to oppose or refuse such a work as
   this; except under the power of such a temptation as Peter was, when he
   denied Christ, or when he dissuaded him from suffering, and heard a
   half excommunication, Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offense
   unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those
   that be of men.' You have put your hand to the plough; you are doubly
   devoted to him, as Christians, and as pastors; and dare you, after
   this, draw back, and refuse his work? You see the work of reformation
   at a stand; and you are engaged by many obligations to promote it: and
   dare you now neglect the means by which it must be done? Will you show
   your faces in a Christian congregation, as ministers of the gospel, and
   there pray for a reformation, and for the conversion and salvation of
   your hearers, and for the prosperity of the Church; and when you have
   done, refuse to use the means by which all this must be effected? I
   know carnal wit will never want words and show of reason, to gainsay
   that truth and duty which it abhors. It is easier now to cavil against
   duty than to perform it: but wait the end, before you pass your final
   judgment. Can you make yourselves believe that you will have a
   comfortable review of these neglects, or make a comfortable account of
   them to God? I dare prognosticate, from the knowledge of the nature of
   grace, that all the godly ministers in England will make conscience of
   this duty, and address themselves to it, except those who, by some
   extraordinary accident, are disabled, or who are under such temptations
   as aforesaid. I do not hopelessly persuade you to it, but take it for
   granted that it will be done. And if any lazy, or jealous, or malicious
   hypocrites, do cavil against it, or hold off, the rest will not do so;
   but they will take the opportunity, and not resist the warnings of the
   Lord. And God will uncase the hypocrites ere long, and make them know,
   to their sorrow, what it was to trifle with him. Woe to them, when they
   must account for the blood of souls! The reasons which satisfied them
   here against duty, will not then satisfy them against duty; but will be
   manifested to have been the effects of their folly, and to have
   proceeded radically from their corrupted wills, and carnal interest.
   Nor will their consciences own those reasons at a dying hour, which now
   they seem to own. Then they shall feel to their sorrow, that there is
   not that comfort to be had for a departing soul, in the review of such
   neglected duty, as there is to them that have wholly devoted themselves
   to the service of the Lord. I am sure my arguments for this duty will
   appear strongest at the last when they shall be viewed at the hour of
   death at the day of judgment and, especially, in the light of eternity.

   And now, brethren, I earnestly beseech you, in the name of God, and for
   the sake of your people's souls, that you will not slightly slubber
   over this work, but do it vigorously, and with all your might; and make
   it your great and serious business. Much judgment is required for the
   managing of it. Study, therefore, beforehand, how to do it, as you
   study for your sermons. I remember how earnest I was with some of the
   last parliament, that they would settle catechists in our assemblies;
   but truly I am not sorry that it took not effect, unless for a few of
   the larger congregations. For I perceive, that all the life of the
   work, under God, doth lie in the prudent effectual management of it, in
   searching men's hearts, and setting home the truth to their
   consciences; and the ablest minister is weak enough for this, and few
   of inferior parts would be found competent to it. For I fear nothing
   more, than that many ministers, who preach well, will be found but
   imperfectly qualified for this work, especially to manage it with old,
   ignorant, dead-hearted sinners. And, indeed, if the ministers be not
   reverenced by the people, they will rather slight them, and contest
   with them, than humbly learn and submit to them: how much more would
   they do so by inferior men? Seeing, then, the work is cast upon us, and
   it is we that must do it, or else it must be undone, let us be up and
   doing with all our might. When you are speaking to your people, do it
   with the greatest prudence and seriousness, and be as earnest with them
   as for life or death; and follow it as closely as you do your public
   exhortations in the pulpit. I profess again, it is to me the most
   comfortable work, except public preaching, (for there I speak to more,
   though yet with less advantage to each individual,) that ever I yet did
   set my hand to. And I doubt not but you will find it so too, if you
   only perform it faithfully.

   My second request to the ministers in these kingdoms, is, that they
   would at last, without any more delay, unanimously set themselves to
   the practice of those parts of Church discipline which are
   unquestionably necessary, and part of their work. It is a sad case,
   that good men should settle themselves so long in the constant neglect
   of so great a duty. The common cry is, Our people are not ready for it;
   they will not bear it.' But is not the fact rather, that you will not
   bear the trouble and hatred which it will occasion? If indeed, you
   proclaim our churches incapable of the order and government of Christ,
   what do you but give up the cause to them that withdraw from us, and
   encourage men to look out for better societies, where that discipline
   may be had For though preaching and sacraments may be omitted in some
   cases, till a fitter season, and accordingly so may discipline; yet it
   is a hard case to settle in a constant neglect, for so many years
   together, as we have done, unless there were an absolute impossibility
   of the work. And if it were so, because of our incapable materials, it
   would plainly call us to alter our constitution, that the matter may be
   capable. I have spoken plainly afterwards of this, which I hope you
   will conscientiously consider of. I now only beseech you, if you would
   give a comfortable account to the chief Shepherd, and would not be
   found unfaithful in the house of God, that you do not wilfully or
   negligently delay it, as if it were a needless thing; nor shrink from
   it, because of the trouble to the flesh that doth attend it; for as
   that is a sad sign of hypocrisy, so the costliest duties are usually
   the most comfortable; and you may be sure that Christ will bear the
   cost.

   My last request is, that all the faithful ministers of Christ would,
   without any more delay, unite and associate for the furtherance of each
   other in the work of the Lord, and the maintaining of unity and concord
   in his churches. And that they would not neglect their brotherly
   meetings to those ends, nor yet spend them unprofitably, but improve
   them to their edification, and the effectual carrying on the work. Read
   that excellent letter of Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury to
   Queen Elizabeth, for ministerial meetings and exercises. You will find
   it in Fuller's History of the Church of England.

   Brethren, I crave your pardon for the infirmities of this address; and
   earnestly longing for the success of your labors, I shall daily beg of
   God, that he would persuade you to those duties which I have here
   recommended to you, and would preserve and prosper you therein, against
   all the serpentine subtlety and rage that are now engaged to oppose and
   hinder you.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

   Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the
   which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of
   God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. Acts 20.28

   Though some think that Paul's exhortation to these elders doth prove
   him their ruler, we who are this day to speak to you from the Lord,
   hope that we may freely do the like, without any jealousies of such a
   conclusion. Though we teach our people, as officers set over them in
   the Lord, yet may we teach one another, as brethren in office, as well
   as in faith. If the people of our charge must teach and admonish and
   exhort each other daily,' no doubt teachers may do it to one another,
   without any super-eminency of power or degree. We have the same sins to
   mortify, and the same graces to be quickened and strengthened, as our
   people have: we have greater works to do than they have, and greater
   difficulties to overcome, and therefore we have need to be warned and
   awakened, if not to be instructed, as well as they. So that I confess I
   think such meetings together should be more frequent, if we had nothing
   else to do but this. And we should deal as plainly and closely with one
   another, as the most serious among us do with our flocks, lest if they
   only have sharp admonitions and reproofs, they only should be sound and
   lively in the faith. That this was Paul's judgment, I need no other
   proof, than this rousing, heart-melting exhortation to the Ephesian
   elders. A short sermon, but not soon learned! Had the bishops and
   teachers of the Church but thoroughly learned this short exhortation,
   though to the neglect of many a volume which hath taken up their time,
   and helped them to greater applause in the world, how happy had it been
   for the Church, and for themselves! In further discoursing on this
   text, I propose to pursue the following method:
     * First, To consider what it is to take heed to ourselves.
     * Secondly, To show why we must take heed to ourselves.
     * Thirdly, To inquire what it is to take heed to all the flock.
     * Fourthly, To illustrate the manner in which we must take heed to
       all the flock.
     * Fifthly, To state some motives why we should take heed to all the
       flock.
     * Lastly, To make some application of the whole.

CHAPTER 1

THE OVERSIGHT OF OURSELVES
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 1 -- THE NATURE OF THIS OVERSIGHT

   Let us consider, what it is to take heed to ourselves.

   1. See that the work of saving grace be thoroughly wrought in your own
   souls. Take heed to yourselves, lest you be void of that saving grace
   of God which you offer to others, and be strangers to the effectual
   working of that gospel which you preach; and lest, while you proclaim
   to the world the necessity of a Savior, your own hearts should neglect
   him, and you should miss of an interest in him and his saving benefits.
   Take heed to yourselves, lest you perish, while you call upon others to
   take heed of perishing; and lest you famish yourselves while you
   prepare food for them. Though there is a promise of shining as the
   stars, to those who turn many to righteousness,' that is but on
   supposition that they are first turned to it themselves. Their own
   sincerity in the faith is the condition of their glory, simply
   considered, though their great ministerial labors may be a condition of
   the promise of their greater glory. Many have warned others that they
   come not to that place of torment, while yet they hastened to it
   themselves: many a preacher is now in hell, who hath a hundred times
   called upon his hearers to use the utmost care and diligence to escape
   it. Can any reasonable man imagine that God should save men for
   offering salvation to others, while they refuse it themselves; and for
   telling others those truths which they themselves neglect and abuse?
   Many a tailor goes in rags, that maketh costly clothes for others; and
   many a cook scarcely licks his fingers, when he hath dressed for others
   the most costly dishes. Believe it, brethren, God never saved any man
   for being a preacher, nor because he was an able preacher; but because
   he was a justified, sanctified man, and consequently faithful in his
   Master's work. Take heed, therefore, to ourselves first, that you be
   that which you persuade your hearers to be, and believe that which you
   persuade them to believe, and heartily entertain that Savior whom you
   offer to them. He that bade you love your neighbors as yourselves, did
   imply that you should love yourselves, and not hate and destroy
   yourselves and them.

   It is a fearful thing to be an unsanctified professor, but much more to
   be an unsanctified preacher. Doth it not make you tremble when you open
   the Bible, lest you should there read the sentence of your own
   condemnation? When you pen your sermons, little do you think that you
   are drawing up indictments against your own souls! When you are arguing
   against sin, that you are aggravating your own! When you proclaim to
   your hearers the unsearchable riches of Christ and his grace, that you
   are publishing your own iniquity in rejecting them, and your
   unhappiness in being destitute of them! What can you do in persuading
   men to Christ, in drawing them from the world, in urging them to a life
   of faith and holiness, but conscience, if it were awake, would tell
   you, that you speak all this to your own confusion? If you speak of
   hell, you speak of your own inheritance: if you describe the joys of
   heaven, you describe your own misery, seeing you have no right to the
   inheritance of the saints in light.' What can you say, for the most
   part, but it will be against your own souls? O miserable life! that a
   man should study and preach against himself, and spend his days in a
   course of self-condemnation! A graceless, inexperienced preacher is one
   of the most unhappy creatures upon earth and yet he is ordinarily very
   insensible of his unhappiness; for he hath so many counters that seem
   like the gold of saving grace, and so many splendid stones that
   resemble Christian jewels, that he is seldom troubled with the thoughts
   of his poverty; but thinks he is rich, and increased in goods, and
   stands in need of nothing, when he is poor, and miserable, and blind,
   and naked.' He is acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, he is exercised
   in holy duties, he liveth not in open disgraceful sin, he serveth at
   God's altar, he reproveth other men's faults, and preacheth up holiness
   both of heart and life; and how can this man choose but be holy? Oh
   what aggravated misery is this, to perish in the midst of plenty! - to
   famish with the bread of life in our hands, while we offer it to
   others, and urge it on them! That those ordinances of God should be the
   occasion of our delusion, which are instituted to be the means of our
   conviction and salvation! and that while we hold the looking-glass of
   the gospel to others, to show them the face and aspect of their souls,
   we should either look on the back part of it ourselves, where we can
   see nothing, or turn it aside, that it may misrepresent us to
   ourselves! If such a wretched man would take my counsel, he would make
   a stand, and call his heart and life to an account, and fall a
   preaching a while to himself, before he preach any more to others. He
   would consider, whether food in the mouth, that goeth not into the
   stomach, will nourish; whether he that nameth the name of Christ should
   not depart from iniquity," whether God will hear his prayers, if he
   regard iniquity in his heart," whether it will serve the turn at the
   day of reckoning to say, Lord, Lord, we have prophesied in thy name,'
   when he shall hear these awful words, Depart from me, I know you not,'
   and what comfort it will be to Judas, when he has gone to his own
   place, to remember that he preached with the other apostles, or that he
   sat with Christ, and was called by him, Friend.' When such thoughts as
   these have entered into their souls, and kindly worked a while upon
   their consciences, I would advise them to go to their congregation, and
   preach over Origen's sermon on Psalm 50.16-17. But unto the wicked God
   saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou
   shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth seeing thou hatest
   instruction, and castest my words behind thee.' And when they have read
   this text, to sit down, and expound and apply it by their tears; and
   then to make a full and free confession of their sin, and lament their
   case before the whole assembly, and desire their earnest prayers to God
   for pardoning and renewing grace; that hereafter they may preach a
   Savior whom they know, and may feel what they speak, and may commend
   the riches of the gospel from their own experience. Alas! it is the
   common danger and calamity of the Church, to have unregenerate and
   inexperienced pastors, and to have so many men become preachers before
   they are Christians; who are sanctified by dedication to the altar as
   the priests of God, before they are sanctified by hearty dedication as
   the disciples of Christ; and so to worship an unknown God, and to
   preach an unknown Christ, to pray through an unknown Spirit, to
   recommend a state of holiness and communion with God, and a glory and a
   happiness which are all unknown, and like to be unknown to them for
   ever. He is like to be but a heartless preacher, that hath not the
   Christ and grace that he preacheth, in his heart. O that all our
   students in our universities would well consider this! What a poor
   business is it to themselves, to spend their time in acquiring some
   little knowledge of the works of God, and of some of those names which
   the divided tongues of the nations have imposed on them, and not to
   know God himself, nor exalt him in their hearts, nor to be acquainted
   with that one renewing work that should make them happy! They do but
   walk in a vain show,' and spend their lives like dreaming men, while
   they busy their wits and tongue about abundance of names and notions,
   and are strangers to God and the life of saints. If ever God awaken
   them by his saving grace, they will have cogitations and employments so
   much more serious than their unsanctified studies and disputations,
   that they will confess they did but dream before. A world of business
   they make themselves about nothing, while they are wilful strangers to
   the primitive, independent, necessary Being, who is all in all. Nothing
   can be rightly known, if God be not known; nor is any study well
   managed, nor to any great purpose, if God is not studied. We know
   little of the creature, till we know it as it stands related to the
   Creator: single letters, and syllables uncomposed, are no better than
   nonsense. He who overlooketh him who is the Alpha and Omega, the
   beginning and the ending,' and seeth not him in all who is the All of
   all, doth see nothing at all. All creatures, as such, are broken
   syllables; they signify nothing as separated from God. Were they
   separated actually, they would cease to be, and the separation would be
   an annihilation; and when we separate them in our fancies, we make
   nothing of them to ourselves. It is one thing to know the creatures as
   Aristotle, and another thing to know them as a Christian. None but a
   Christian can read one line of his Physics so as to understand it
   rightly. It is a high and excellent study, and of greater use than many
   apprehend; but it is the smallest part of it that Aristotle can teach
   us.

   When man was made perfect, and placed in a perfect world, where all
   things were in perfect order, the whole creation was then man's book,
   in which he was to read the nature and will of his great Creator. Every
   creature had the name of God so legibly engraven on it, that man might
   run and read it. He could not open his eyes, but he might see some
   image of God; but no where so fully and lively as in himself. It was,
   therefore, his work to study the whole volume of nature, but first and
   most to study himself. And if man had held on in this course, he would
   have continued and increased in the knowledge of God and himself; but
   when he would needs know and love the creature and himself in a way of
   separation from God, he lost the knowledge both of the creature and of
   the Creator, so far as it could beatify and was worth the name of
   knowledge; and instead of it, he hath got the unhappy knowledge which
   he affected, even the empty notions and fantastic knowledge of the
   creature and himself, as thus separated. And thus, he that lived to the
   Creator, and upon him, doth now live to and upon the other creatures,
   and on himself; and thus, Every man at his best estate' (the learned as
   well as the illiterate) is altogether vanity. Surely every man walketh
   in a vain show; surely they are disquieted in vain.' And it must be
   well observed, that as God laid not aside the relation of a Creator by
   becoming our Redeemer, relation, but the work of redemption standeth,
   in some respect, in subordination to that of creation, and the law of
   the Redeemer to the law of the Creator; so also the duties which we
   owed to God as Creator have not ceased, but the duties that we owe to
   the Redeemer, as such, are subordinate thereto. It is the work of
   Christ to bring us back to God, and to restore us to the perfection of
   holiness and obedience; and as he is the way to the Father, so faith in
   him is the way to our former employment and enjoyment of God. I hope
   you perceive what I aim at in all this, namely, that to see God in his
   creatures, and to love him, and converse with him, was the employment
   of man in his upright state; that this is so far from ceasing to be our
   duty, that it is the work of Christ to bring us, by faith, back to it;
   and therefore the most holy men are the most excellent students of
   God's works, and none but the holy can rightly study them or know them.
   His works are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure
   therein,' but not for themselves, but for him that made them. Your
   study of physics and other sciences is not worth a rush, if it be not
   God that you seek after in them. To see and admire, to reverence and
   adore, to love and delight in God, as exhibited in his works - this is
   the true and only philosophy; the contrary is mere foolery, and is so
   called again and again by God himself. This is the sanctification of
   your studies, when they are devoted to God, and when he is the end, the
   object, and the life of them all.

   And, therefore, I shall presume to tell you, by the way, that it is a
   grand error, and of dangerous consequence in Christian academies,
   (pardon the censure from one so unfit to pass it, seeing the necessity
   of the case commandeth it,) that they study the creature before the
   Redeemer, and set themselves to physics, and metaphysics, and
   mathematics, before they set themselves to theology; whereas, no man
   that hath not the vitals of theology, is capable of going beyond a fool
   in philosophy. Theology must lay the foundation, and lead the way of
   all our studies. If God must be searched after, in our search of the
   creature, (and we must affect no separated knowledge of them) then
   tutors must read God to their pupils in all; and divinity must be the
   beginning, the middle, the end, the life, the all, of their studies.
   Our physics and metaphysics must be reduced to theology; and nature
   must be read as one of God's books, which is purposely written for the
   revelation of himself. The Holy Scripture is the easier book: when you
   have first learned from it God, and his will, as to the most necessary
   things, address yourselves to the study of his works, and read every
   creature as a Christian and a divine. If you see not yourselves, and
   all things, as living, and moving, and having being in God, you see
   nothing, whatever you think you see. If you perceive not, in your study
   of the creatures, that God is all, and in all, and that of him, and
   through him, and to him, are all things,' you may think, perhaps, that
   you know something; but you know nothing as you ought to know.' Think
   not so basely of your physics, and of the works of God, as that they
   are only preparatory studies for boys. It is a most high and noble part
   of holiness, to search after, behold admire, and love the great Creator
   in all his works. How much have the saints of God been employed in this
   high and holy exercise! The book of Job, and the Psalms, may show us
   that our physics are not so little kin to theology as some suppose.

   I do, therefore, in zeal for the good of the Church, and their own
   success in their most necessary labors, propound it for the
   consideration of all pious tutors, whether they should not as timely,
   and as diligently, read to their pupils, or cause them to read, the
   chief parts of practical divinity (and there is no other), as any of
   the sciences; and whether they should not go together from the very
   first? It is well that they hear sermons; but that is not enough. If
   tutors would make it their principal business to acquaint their pupils
   with the doctrine of salvation, and labor to set it home upon their
   hearts, that all might be received according to its weight, and read to
   their hearts as well as to their heads, and so carry on the rest of
   their instructions, that it may appear they make them but subservient
   unto this, and that their pupils may feel what they aim at in them all;
   and so that they would teach all their philosophy in habitu theologico,
   - this might be a happy means to make a happy Church and a happy
   country. But, when languages and philosophy have almost all their time
   and diligence, and, instead of reading philosophy like divines, they
   read divinity like philosophers, as if it were a thing of no more
   moment than a lesson of music, or arithmetic, and not the doctrine of
   everlasting life; - this it is that blasteth so many in the bud, and
   pestereth the Church with unsanctified teachers! Hence it is, that we
   have so many worldlings to preach of the invisible felicity, and so
   many carnal men to declare the mysteries of the Spirit; and I would I
   might not say, so many infidels to preach Christ, or so many atheists
   to preach the living God: and when they are taught philosophy before or
   without religion, what wonder if their philosophy be all or most of
   their religion!

   Again, therefore, I address myself to all who have the charge of the
   education of youth, especially in order to preparation for the
   ministry. You, that are schoolmasters and tutors, begin and end with
   the things of God. Speak daily to the hearts of your scholars those
   things that must be wrought into their hearts, or else they are undone.
   Let some piercing words fall frequently from your mouths, of God, and
   the state of their souls, and the life to come. Do not say, they are
   too young to understand and entertain them. You little know what
   impressions they may make. Not only the soul of the boy, but many souls
   may have cause to bless God, for your zeal and diligence, yea, for one
   such seasonable word. You have a great advantage above others to do
   them good; you have them before they are grown to maturity, and they
   will hear you when they will not hear another. If they are destined to
   the ministry, you are preparing them for the special service of God,
   and must they not first have the knowledge of him whom they have to
   serve? Oh think with yourselves, what a sad thing it will be to their
   own souls, and what a wrong to the Church of God, if they come out from
   you with common and carnal hearts, to so great and holy and spiritual a
   work! Of a hundred students in one of our colleges, how many may there
   be that are serious, experienced, godly young men! If you should send
   one half of them on a work which they are unfit for, what cruel work
   will they make in the Church or country! Whereas, if you be the means
   of their conversion and sanctification, how many souls may bless you,
   and what greater good can you do the Church? When once their hearts are
   savingly affected with the doctrine which they study and preach, they
   will study it more heartily, and preach it more heartily: their own
   experience will direct them to the fittest subjects, and will furnish
   them with matter, and quicken them to set it home to the conscience of
   their hearers. See, therefore, that you make not work for the groans
   and lamentation of the Church, nor for the great tormentor of the
   murderers of souls.

   2. Content not yourselves with being in a state of grace, but be also
   careful that your graces are kept in vigorous and lively exercise, and
   that you preach to yourselves the sermons which you study, before you
   preach them to others. If you did this for your own sakes, it would not
   be lost labor; but I am speaking to you upon the public account, that
   you would do it for the sake of the Church. When your minds are in a
   holy, heavenly frame, your people are likely to partake of the fruits
   of it. Your prayers, and praises, and doctrine will be sweet and
   heavenly to them. They will likely feel when you have been much with
   God: that which is most on your hearts, is like to be most in their
   ears. I confess I must speak it by lamentable experience, that I
   publish to my flock the distempers of my own soul. When I let my heart
   grow cold, my preaching is cold; and when it is confused, my preaching
   is confused; and so I can oft observe also in the best of my hearers,
   that when I have grown cold in preaching, they have grown cold too; and
   the next prayers which I have heard from them have been too like my
   preaching. We are the nurses of Christ's little ones. If we forbear
   taking food ourselves, we shall famish them; it will soon be visible in
   their leanness, and dull discharge of their several duties. If we let
   our love decline, we are not like to raise up theirs. If we abate our
   holy care and fear, it will appear in our preaching: if the matter show
   it not, the manner will. If we feed on unwholesome food, either errors
   or fruitless controversies, our hearers are like to fare the worse for
   it. Whereas, if we abound in faith, and love, and zeal, how would it
   overflow to the refreshing of our congregations, and how would it
   appear in the increase of the same graces in them! O brethren, watch
   therefore over your own hearts: keep out lusts and passions, and
   worldly inclinations; keep up the life of faith, and love, and zeal: be
   much at home, and be much with God. If it be not your daily business to
   study your own hearts, and to subdue corruption, and to walk with God -
   if you make not this a work to which you constantly attend, all will go
   wrong, and you will starve your hearers; or, if you have an affected
   fervency, you cannot expect a blessing to attend it from on high. Above
   all, be much in secret prayer and meditation. Thence you must fetch the
   heavenly fire that must kindle your sacrifices: remember, you cannot
   decline and neglect your duty, to your own hurt alone; many will be
   losers by it as well as you. For your people's sakes, therefore, look
   to your hearts. If a pang of spiritual pride should overtake you, and
   you should fall into any dangerous error, and vent your own inventions
   to draw away disciples after you, what a wound may this prove to the
   Church, of which you have the oversight; and you may become a plague to
   them instead of a blessing, and they may wish they had never seen your
   faces. Oh, therefore, take heed to your own judgments and affections.
   Vanity and error will slyly insinuate, and seldom come without fair
   pretences: great distempers and apostasies have usually small
   beginnings. The prince of darkness doth frequently personate an angel
   of light, to draw the children of light again into darkness. How easily
   also will distempers creep in upon our affections and our first love,
   and fear and care abate! Watch, therefore, for the sake of yourselves
   and others.

   But, besides this general course of watchfulness, methinks a minister
   should take some special pains with his heart, before he is to go to
   the congregation: if it be then cold, how is he likely to warm the
   hearts of his hearers? Therefore, go then specially to God for life:
   read some rousing, awakening book, or meditate on the weight of the
   subject of which you are to speak, and on the great necessity of your
   people's souls, that you may go in the zeal of the Lord into his house.
   Maintain, in this manner, the life of grace in yourselves, that it may
   appear in all your sermons from the pulpit, - that every one who comes
   cold to the assembly, may have some warmth imparted to him before he
   depart.

   3. Take heed to yourselves, lest your example contradict your doctrine,
   and lest you lay such stumbling-blocks before the blind, as may be the
   occasion of their ruin; lest you unsay with your lives, what you say
   with your tongues; and be the greatest hinderers of the success of your
   own labors. It much hindereth our work, when other men are all the week
   long contradicting to poor people in private, that which we have been
   speaking to them from the Word of God in public, because we cannot be
   at hand to expose their folly; but it will much more hinder your work,
   if you contradict yourselves, and if your actions give your tongue the
   lie, and if you build up an hour or two with your mouths, and all the
   week after pull down with your hands! This is the way to make men think
   that the Word of God is but an idle tale, and to make preaching seem no
   better than prating. He that means as he speaks, will surely do as he
   speaks. One proud, surly, lordly word, one needless contention, one
   covetous action, may cut the throat of many a sermon, and blast the
   fruit of all that you have been doing. Tell me, brethren, in the fear
   of God, do you regard the success of your labors, or do you not? Do you
   long to see it upon the souls of your hearers? If you do not, what do
   you preach for; what do you study for; and what do you call yourselves
   the ministers of Christ for? But if you do, then surely you cannot find
   in your heart to mar your work for a thing of nought. What! do you
   regard the success of your labors, and yet will not part with a little
   to the poor, nor put up with an injury, or a foul word, nor stoop to
   the meanest, nor forbear your passionate or lordly carriage, - no, not
   for the winning of souls, and attaining the end of all your labors! You
   little value success, indeed, that will sell it at so cheap a rate, or
   will not do so small a matter to attain it. It is a palpable error of
   some ministers, who make such a disproportion between their preaching
   and their living; who study hard to preach exactly, and study little or
   not at all to live exactly. All the week long is little enough, to
   study how to speak two hours; and yet one hour seems too much to study
   how to live all the week. They are loath to misplace a word in their
   sermons, or to be guilty of any notable infirmity, (and I blame them
   not, for the matter is holy and weighty,) but they make nothing of
   misplacing affections, words, and actions, in the course of their
   lives. Oh how curiously have I heard some men preach; and how
   carelessly have I seen them live! They have been so accurate as to the
   preparation of their sermons, that seldom preaching seemed to them a
   virtue, that their language might be the more polite, and all the
   rhetorical writers they could meet with were pressed to serve them for
   the adorning of their style, (and gauds were oft their chiefest
   ornaments.) They were so nice in hearing others, that no man pleased
   them that spoke as he thought, or that drowned not affections, or
   dulled not, or distempered not the heart by the predominant strains of
   a fantastic wit. And yet, when it came to matter of practice, and they
   were once out of church, how incurious were the men, and how little did
   they regard what they said or did, so it were not so palpably gross as
   to dishonor them! They that preach precisely, would not live precisely!
   What a difference was there between their pulpit speeches and their
   familiar discourse? They that were most impatient of barbarisms,
   solecisms, and paralogisms in a sermon, could easily tolerate them in
   their life and conversation.

   Certainly, brethren, we have very great cause to take heed what we do,
   as well as what we say: if we will be the servants of Christ indeed, we
   must not be tongue servants only, but must serve him with our deeds,
   and be doers of the work, that we may be blessed in our deed.' As our
   people must be doers of the word, and not hearers only,' so we must be
   doers and not speakers only, lest we deceive our own selves.' A
   practical doctrine must be practically preached. We must study as hard
   how to live well, as how to preach well. We must think and think again,
   how to compose our lives, as may most tend to men's salvation, as well
   as our sermons.

   When you are studying what to say to your people, if you have any
   concern for their souls, you will oft be thinking with yourself, How
   shall I get within them? and what shall I say, that is most likely to
   convince them, and convert them, and promote their salvation!' And
   should you not as diligently think with yourself, How shall I live, and
   what shall I do, and how shall I dispose of all that I have, as may
   most tend to the saving of men's souls?' Brethen, if the saving of
   souls be your end, you will certainly intend it out of the pulpit as
   well as in it! If it be your end, you will live for it, and contribute
   all your endeavors to attain it. You will ask concerning the money in
   your purse, as well as concerning the word of your mouth, In what way
   shall I lay it out for the greatest good, especially to men's souls?'
   Oh that this were your daily study, how to use your wealth, your
   friends, and all you have for God, as well as your tongues! Then should
   we see that fruit of your labors, which is never else like to be seen.
   If you intend the end of the ministry in the pulpit only, it would seem
   you take yourselves for ministers no longer than you are there. And, if
   so, I think you are unworthy to be esteemed ministers at all.

   Let me then entreat you, brethren, to do well, as well as say well. Be
   zealous of good works.' Spare not for any cost, if it may promote your
   Master's work.

   (1) Maintain your innocency, and walk without offense. Let your lives
   condemn sin, and persuade men to duty. Would you have your people more
   careful of their souls, than you are of yours? If you would have them
   redeem their time, do not you mis-spend yours. If you would not have
   them vain in their conference, see that you speak yourselves the things
   which may edify, and tend to minister grace to the hearers.' Order your
   own families well, if you would have them do so by theirs. Be not proud
   and lordly, if you would have them to be lowly. There are no virtues
   wherein your example will do more, at least to abate men's prejudice,
   than humility and meekness and self-denial. Forgive injuries; and be
   not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.' Do as our Lord,
   who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.' If sinners be stubborn
   and stout and contemptuous, flesh and blood will persuade you to take
   up their weapons, and to master them by their carnal means: but that is
   not the way, (further than necessary self-preservation or public good
   may require,) but overcome them with kindness and patience and
   gentleness. The former may show that you have more worldly power than
   they (wherein yet they are ordinarily too hard for the faithful); but
   it is the latter only that will tell them that you excel them in
   spiritual excellency. If you believe that Christ is more worthy of
   imitation than Caesar or Alexander, and that it is more glory to be a
   Christian than to be a conqueror, yea to be a man than a beast - which
   often exceed us in strength - contend with charity, and not with
   violence; set meekness and love and patience against force, and not
   force against force. Remember, you are obliged to be the servants of
   all. Condescend to men of low estate.' Be not strange to the poor of
   your flock; they are apt to take your strangeness for contempt.
   Familiarity, improved to holy ends, may do abundance of good. Speak not
   stoutly or disrespectfully to any one; but be courteous to the meanest,
   as to your equal in Christ. A kind and winning carriage is a cheap way
   of doing men good.

   (2) Let me entreat you to abound in works of charity and benevolence.
   Go to the poor, and see what they want, and show your compassion at
   once to their soul and body. Buy them a catechism, and other small
   books that are likely to do them good, and make them promise to read
   them with care and attention. Stretch your purse to the utmost, and do
   all the good you can. Think not of being rich; seek not great things
   for yourselves or your posterity. What if you do impoverish yourselves
   to do a greater good; will this be loss or gain? If you believe that
   God is the safest purse-bearer, and that to expend in his service is
   the greatest usury, show them that you do believe it. I know that flesh
   and blood will cavil before it will lose its prey, and will never want
   somewhat to say against this duty that is against its interest; but
   mark what I say (and the Lord set it home upon your hearts), that man
   who hath any thing in the world so dear to him, that he cannot spare it
   for Christ, if he call for it, is no true Christian. And because a
   carnal heart will not believe that Christ calls for it when he cannot
   spare it, and, therefore, makes that his self-deceiving shift, I say
   further, that the man who will not be persuaded that duty is duty,
   because he cannot spare that for Christ which is therein to be
   expended, is no true Christian; for a false heart corrupteth the
   understanding, and that again increaseth the delusions of the heart. Do
   not take it, therefore, as an undoing, to make friends of the mammon of
   unrighteousness and to lay up treasure in heaven, though you leave
   yourselves but little on earth. You lose no great advantage for heaven,
   by becoming poor: In pursuing one's way, the lighter one travels the
   better.'

   I know, where the heart is carnal and covetous, words will not wring
   men's money out of their hands; they can say all this, and more to
   others; but saying is one thing, and believing is another. But with
   those that are true believers, methinks such considerations should
   prevail. O what abundance of good might ministers do, if they would but
   live in contempt of the world, and the riches and glory thereof, and
   expend all they have in their Master's service, and pinch their flesh,
   that they may have wherewith to do good! This would unlock more hearts
   to the reception of their doctrine, than all their oratory; and,
   without this, singularity in religion will seem but hypocrisy; and it
   is likely that it is so. He who practises disinterestedness prays to
   the Lord; he who snatches a man from peril offers a rich sacrifice;
   these are our sacrifices; these are holy to God. Thus he who is more
   devout among us is he who is more self-effacing,' saith Minucius Felix.
   Though we need not do as the papists, who betake themselves to
   monasteries, and cast away property, yet we must have nothing but what
   we have for God.

   4. Take heed to yourselves, lest you live in those sins which you
   preach against in others, and lest you be guilty of that which daily
   you condemn. Will you make it your work to magnify God, and, when you
   have done, dishonor him as much as others? Will you proclaim Christ's
   governing power, and yet contemn it, and rebel yourselves? Will you
   preach his laws, and wilfully break them? If sin be evil, why do you
   live in it? If it be not, why do you dissuade men from it? If it be
   dangerous, how dare you venture on it? if it be not, why do you tell
   men so? If God's threatenings be true, why do you not fear them? if
   they be false, why do you needlessly trouble men with them, and put
   them into such frights without a cause? Do you know the judgment of
   God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death,' and yet
   will you do them? Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not
   thyself? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery,' or be
   drunk, or covetous, art thou such thyself? Thou that makest thy boast
   of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God?' What! shall
   the same tongue speak evil that speakest against evil? Shall those lips
   censure, and slander, and backbite your neighbor, that cry down these
   and the like things in others? Take heed to yourselves, lest you cry
   down sin, and yet do not overcome it; lest, while you seek to bring it
   down in others, you bow to it, and become its slaves yourselves: For of
   whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought into bondage.' To
   whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom
   ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
   righteousness.' O brethren! it is easier to chide at sin, than to
   overcome it.

   Lastly, take heed to yourselves, that you want not the qualifications
   necessary for your work. He must not be himself a babe in knowledge,
   that will teach men all those mysterious things which must be known in
   order to salvation. O what qualifications are necessary for a man who
   hath such a charge upon him as we have! How many difficulties in
   divinity to be solved! and these, too, about the fundamental principles
   of religion! How many obscure texts of Scripture to be expounded! How
   many duties to be performed, wherein ourselves and others may miscarry,
   if in the matter, and manner, and end, we be not well informed! How
   many sins to be avoided, which, without understanding and foresight
   cannot be done! What a number of sly and subtle temptations must we
   open to our people's eyes, that they may escape them! How many weighty
   and yet intricate cases of conscience have we almost daily to resolve!
   And can so much work, and such work as this, be done by raw,
   unqualified men? O what strong holds have we to batter, and how many of
   them! What subtle and obstinate resistance must we expect from every
   heart we deal with! Prejudice hath so blocked up our way, that we can
   scarcely procure a patient hearing. We cannot make a breach in their
   groundless hopes and carnal peace, but they have twenty shifts and
   seeming reasons to make it up again; and twenty enemies, that are
   seeming friends, are ready to help them. We dispute not with them upon
   equal terms. We have children to reason with, that cannot understand
   us. We have distracted men (in spirituals) to argue with, that will
   bawl us down with raging nonsense. We have wilful, unreasonable people
   to deal with, who, when they are silenced, are never the more
   convinced, and who, when they can give you no reason, will give you
   their resolution; like the man that Salvian had to deal with, who,
   being resolved to devour a poor man's substance, and being entreated by
   him to forbear, replied, He could not grant his request, for he had
   made a vow to take it,' so that the preacher, by reason of this most
   religious evil deed, was fain to depart. We dispute the case against
   men's wills and passions, as much as against their understandings; and
   these have neither reason nor ears. Their best arguments are, I will
   not believe you, nor all the preachers in the world, in such things. I
   will not change my mind, or life; I will not leave my sins; I will
   never be so precise, come of it what will.' We have not one, but
   multitudes of raging passions, and contradicting enemies, to dispute
   against at once, whenever we go about the conversion of a sinner; as if
   a man were to dispute in a fair or a tumult, or in the midst of a crowd
   of violent scolds. What equal dealing, and what success, could here be
   expected? Yet such is our work; and it is a work that must be done.

   O brethren! what men should we be in skill, resolution, and unwearied
   diligence, who have all this to do? Did Paul cry out, Who is sufficient
   for these things?' And shall we be proud, or careless, or lazy, as if
   we were sufficient? As Peter saith to every Christian, in consideration
   of our great approaching change, What manner of persons ought we to be
   in all holy conversation and godliness!' so may I say to every
   minister, Seeing all these things lie upon our hands, what manner of
   persons ought we to be in all holy endeavors and resolutions for our
   work!' This is not a burden for the shoulders of a child. What skill
   doth every part of our work require! - and of how much moment is every
   part! To preach a sermon, I think, is not the hardest part; and yet
   what skill is necessary to make the truth plain; to convince the
   hearers, to let irresistible light in to their consciences, and to keep
   it there, and drive all home; to screw the truth into their minds, and
   work Christ into their affections; to meet every objection, and clearly
   to resolve it; to drive sinners to a stand, and make them see that
   there is no hope, but that they must unavoidably either be converted or
   condemned - and to do all this, as regards language and manner, as
   beseems our work, and yet as is most suitable to the capacities of our
   hearers. This, and a great deal more that should be done in every
   sermon, must surely require a great deal of holy skill. So great a God,
   whose message we deliver, should be honored by our delivery of it. It
   is a lamentable case, that in a message from the God of heaven, of
   everlasting moment to the souls of men, we should behave ourselves so
   weakly, so unhandsomely, so imprudently, or so slightly, that the whole
   business should miscarry in our hands, and God should be dishonored,
   and his work disgraced, and sinners rather hardened than converted; and
   all this through our weakness or neglect! How often have carnal hearers
   gone home jeering at the palpable and dishonorable failings of the
   preacher! How many sleep under us, because our hearts and tongues are
   sleepy, and we bring not with us so much skill and zeal as to awake
   them! Moreover, what skill is necessary to defend the truth against
   gainsayers, and to deal with disputing cavillers, according to their
   several modes and case! And if we fail through weakness, how will they
   exult over us! Yet that is the smallest matter: but who knows how many
   weak ones may thereby be perverted, to their own undoing, and to the
   trouble of the Church? What skill is necessary to deal in private with
   one poor ignorant soul for his conversion! O brethren! do you not
   shrink and tremble under the sense of all this work? Will a common
   measure of holy skill and ability, of prudence and other
   qualifications, serve for such a task as this? I know necessity may
   cause the Church to tolerate the weak; but woe to us, if we tolerate
   and indulge our own weakness! Do not reason and conscience tell you,
   that if you dare venture on so high a work as this, you should spare no
   pains to be qualified for the performance of it? It is not now and then
   an idle snatch or taste of studies that will serve to make an able and
   sound divine. I know that laziness hath learned to allege the vanity of
   all our studies, and how entirely the Spirit must qualify us for, and
   assist us in our work; as if God commanded us the use of means, and
   then warranted us to neglect them; as if it were his way to cause us to
   thrive in a course of idleness, and to bring us to knowledge by dreams
   when we are asleep, or to take us up into heaven, and show us his
   counsels, while we think of no such matter, but are idling away our
   time on earth! O that men should dare, by their laziness, to quench the
   Spirit,' and then pretend the Spirit for the doing of it! O outrageous,
   shameful and unnatural deed!' God hath required us, that we be not
   slothful in business,' but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.' Such
   we must provoke our hearers to be, and such we must be ourselves. O,
   therefore, brethren, lose no time! Study, and pray, and confer, and
   practice; for in these four ways your abilities must be increased. Take
   heed to yourselves, lest you are weak through your own negligence, and
   lest you mar the work of God by your weakness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 2 THE MOTIVES TO THIS OVERSIGHT

   Having showed you what it is to take heed to ourselves, I shall next
   lay before you some motives to awaken you to this duty.

   1. Take heed to yourselves, for you have a heaven to win or lose, and
   souls that must be happy or miserable for ever; and therefore it
   concerneth you to begin at home, and to take heed to yourselves as well
   as to others. Preaching well may succeed to the salvation of others,
   without the holiness of your own hearts and lives; it is, at least,
   possible, though less usual; but it is impossible it should save
   yourselves. Many will say in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
   prophesied in thy name?' to whom he will answer, I never knew you;
   depart from me, ye that work iniquity.' O sirs, how many men have
   preached Christ, and yet have perished for want of a saving interest in
   him! How many, who are now in hell, have told their people of the
   torments of hell, and warned them to escape from it! How many have
   preached of the wrath of God against sinners, who are now enduring it!
   O what sadder case can there be in the world, than for a man, who made
   it his very trade and calling to proclaim salvation, and to help others
   to heaven, yet after all to be himself shut out! Alas! that we should
   have so many books in our libraries which tell us the way to heaven;
   that we should spend so many years in reading these books, and studying
   the doctrine of eternal life, and after all this to miss it! -- that we
   should study so many sermons of salvation, and yet fall short of it! --
   that we should preach so many sermons of damnation, and yet fall into
   it? And all because we preached so many sermons of Christ, while we
   neglected him; of the Spirit, while we resisted him; of faith, while we
   did not ourselves believe; of repentance and conversion, while we
   continued in an impenitent and unconverted state; and of a heavenly
   life, while we remained carnal and earthly ourselves. If we will be
   divines only in tongue and title, and have not the Divine image upon
   our souls, nor give up ourselves to the Divine honor and will, no
   wonder if we be separated from the Divine presence, and denied the
   fruition of God for ever. Believe it, sirs, God is no respecter of
   persons: he saveth not men for their coats or callings; a holy calling
   will not save an unholy man. If you stand at the door of the kingdom of
   grace, to light others in, and will not go in yourselves, you shall
   knock in vain at the gates of glory, that would not enter at the door
   of grace. You shall then find that your lamps should have had the oil
   of grace, as well as of ministerial gifts -- of holiness, as well as of
   doctrine -- if you would have had a part in the glory which you
   preached. Do I need to tell you, that preachers of the gospel must be
   judged by the gospel; and stand at the same bar, and be sentenced on
   the same terms, and dealt with as severely, as any other men? Can you
   think to be saved, then, by your clergy; and to come off by a He passed
   for a clergyman,' when there is wanting the He believed and lived as a
   Christian.' Alas, it will not be! You know it will not be. Take heed
   therefore to yourselves, for your own sakes; seeing you have souls to
   save or lose, as well as others.

   2. Take heed to yourselves, for you have a depraved nature, and sinful
   inclinations, as well as others. If innocent Adam had need of heed, and
   lost himself and us for want of it, how much more need have such as we!
   Sin dwelleth in us, when we have preached ever so much against it; and
   one degree prepareth the heart for another, and one sin inclineth the
   mind to more. If one thief be in the house, he will let in the rest;
   because they have the same disposition and design. A spark is the
   beginning of a flame; and a small disease may cause a greater. A man
   who knows himself to be purblind, should take heed to his feet. Alas!
   in our hearts, as well as in our hearers, there is an averseness to
   God, a strangeness to him, unreasonable and almost unruly passions! In
   us there are, at the best, the remnants of pride, unbelief,
   self-seeking, hypocrisy, and all the most hateful, deadly sins. And
   doth it not then concern us to take heed to ourselves? Is so much of
   the fire of hell yet unextinguished, that was at first kindled in us?
   Are there so many traitors in our very hearts, and is it not necessary
   for us to take heed? You will scarcely let your little children go
   themselves while they are weak, without calling upon them to take heed
   of falling. And, alas! how weak are those of us that seem strongest!
   How apt to stumble at a very straw! How small a matter will cast us
   down, by enticing us to folly; or kindling our passions and inordinate
   desires, by perverting our judgments, weakening our resolutions,
   cooling our zeal, and abating our diligence! Ministers are not only
   sons of Adam, but sinners against the grace of Christ, as well as
   others; and so have increased their radical sin. These treacherous
   hearts of yours will, one time or other, deceive you, if you take not
   heed. Those sins that seem now to lie dead will revive: your pride, and
   worldliness, and many a noisome vice, will spring up, that you thought
   had been weeded out by the roots. It is most necessary, therefore, that
   men of so much infirmity should take heed to themselves, and be careful
   in the oversight of their own souls.

   3. Take heed to yourselves, because the tempter will more ply you with
   his temptations than other men. If you will be the leaders against the
   prince of darkness, he will spare you no further than God restraineth
   him. He beareth the greatest malice to those that are engaged to do him
   the greatest mischief. As he hateth Christ more than any of us, because
   he is the General of the field, the Captain of our salvation, and doth
   more than all the world besides against his kingdom; so doth he hate
   the leaders under him, more than the common soldiers: he knows what a
   rout he may make among them, if the leaders fall before their eyes. He
   hath long tried that way of fighting, neither against great nor small
   comparatively, but of smiting the shepherds, that he may scatter the
   flock: and so great hath been his success this way, that he will
   continue to follow it as far as he is able. Take heed, therefore,
   brethren, for the enemy hath a special eye upon you. You shall have his
   most subtle insinuations, and incessant solicitations, and violent
   assaults. As wise and learned as you are, take heed to yourselves, lest
   he outwit you. The devil is a greater scholar than you, and a nimbler
   disputant; he can transform himself into an angel of light to deceive:
   he will get within you, and trip up your heels before you are aware: he
   will play the juggler with you undiscerned, and cheat you of your faith
   or innocency, and you shall not know that you have lost it; nay, he
   will make you believe it is multiplied or increased, when it is lost.
   You shall see neither hook nor line, much less the subtle angler
   himself, while he is offering you his bait. And his bait shall be so
   fitted to your temper and disposition, that he will be sure to find
   advantages within you, and make your own principles and inclinations
   betray you; and whenever he ruineth you, he will make you the
   instruments of ruin to others. O what a conquest will he think he hath
   got, if he can make a minister lazy and unfaithful, if he can tempt a
   minister into covetousness or scandal! He will glory against the
   Church, and say, These are your holy preachers! See what their
   preciseness is, and whither it brings them.' He will glory against
   Jesus Christ himself, and say, These are thy champions! I can make thy
   chiefest servants abuse thee; I can make the stewards of thy house
   unfaithful.' If he did so insult God upon a false surmise, and tell him
   he could make Job curse him to his face, what will he do if he should
   prevail against you? And at last he will insult as much over you, that
   he could draw you to be false to your great trust, and to blemish your
   holy profession, and to do so much service to him that was your enemy.
   O, do not so far gratify Satan; do not make him so much sport; suffer
   him not to use you as the Philistines did Samson, first to deprive you
   of your strength, and then to put out your eyes, and so to make you the
   matter of his triumph and derision.

   4. Take heed to yourselves, because there are many eyes upon you, and
   there will be many to observe your falls. You cannot miscarry but the
   world will ring of it. The eclipses of the sun by day are seldom
   without witnesses. As you take yourselves for the lights of the
   churches, you may expect that men's eyes will be upon you. If other men
   may sin without observation, so cannot you. And you should thankfully
   consider how great a mercy this is, that you have so many eyes to watch
   over you, and so many ready to tell you of your faults; and thus have
   greater helps than others, at least for restraining you from sin.
   Though they may do it with a malicious mind, yet you have the advantage
   of it. God forbid that we should prove so impudent as to do evil in the
   public view of all, and to sin wilfully while the world is gazing on
   us! They that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are
   drunken in the night.' Why, consider that you are ever in the open
   light: even the light of your own doctrine will expose your evil
   doings. While you are as lights set upon a hill, think not to lie hid.
   Take heed therefore to yourselves, and do your work as those that
   remember that the world looks on them, and that with the quick-sighted
   eye of malice, ready to make the worst of all, to find the smallest
   fault where it is, to aggravate it where they find it, to divulge it
   and to take advantage of it to their own designs, and to make faults
   where they cannot find them. How cautiously, then, should we walk
   before so many ill-minded observers!

   5. Take heed to yourselves, for your sins have more heinous
   aggravations than other men's. It was a saying of king Alphonsus, that
   a great man cannot commit a small sin,' much more may we say, that a
   learned man, or a teacher of others, cannot commit a small sin; or, at
   least, that the sin is great as committed by him, which is smaller as
   committed by another.

   (1) You are more likely than others to sin against knowledge, because
   you have more than they; at least, you sin against more light, or means
   of knowledge. What! do you not know that covetousness and pride are
   sins? do you not know what it is to be unfaithful to your trust, and,
   by negligence or self-seeking, to betray men's souls? You know your
   Master's will; and, if you do it not, you shall be beaten with many
   stripes.' There must needs be the more wilfulness, by how much there is
   the more knowledge.

   (2) Your sins have more hypocrisy in them than other men's, by how much
   the more you have spoken against them. O what a heinous thing is it in
   us, to study how to disgrace sin to the utmost, and make it as odious
   in the eyes of our people as we can, and when we have done, to live in
   it, and secretly cherish that which we publicly disgrace! What vile
   hypocrisy is it, to make it our daily work to cry it down, and yet to
   keep to it; to call it publicly all naught, and privately to make it
   our bed-fellow and companion; to bind heavy burdens on others, and not
   to touch them ourselves with a finger! What can you say to this in
   judgment? Did you think as ill of sin as you spoke, or did you not? If
   you did not, why would you dissemblingly speak against it? If you did,
   why would you keep it and commit it? O bear not that badge of a
   hypocritical Pharisee, They say, but do not.' Many a minister of the
   gospel will be confounded, and not be able to look up, by reason of
   this heavy charge of hypocrisy.

   (3) Your sins have more perfidiousness in them than other men's, by how
   much the more you have engaged yourselves against them. Besides all
   your common engagements as Christians, you have many more as ministers.
   How oft have you proclaimed the evil and danger of sin, and called
   sinners from it? How oft have you denounced against it the terrors of
   the Lord? All this surely implied that you renounced it yourselves.
   Every sermon that you preached against it, every exhortation, every
   confession of it in the congregation, did lay an engagement upon you to
   forsake it. Every child that you baptized, and every administration of
   the supper of the Lord, did import your own renouncing of the world and
   the flesh, and your engagement to Christ. How oft, and how openly, have
   you borne witness to the odiousness and damnable nature of sin? and yet
   will you entertain it, notwithstanding all these professions and
   testimonies of your own? O what treachery is it to make such a stir
   against it in the pulpit, and, after all, to entertain it in thy heart,
   and give it the room that is due to God, and even prefer it before the
   glory of the saints!

   6. Take heed to yourselves, because such great works as ours require
   greater grace than other men's. Weaker gifts and graces may carry a man
   through in a more even course of life, that is not liable to so great
   trials. Smaller strength may serve for lighter works and burdens. But
   if you will venture on the great undertakings of the ministry; if you
   will lead on the troops of Christ against Satan and his followers; if
   you will engage yourselves against principalities and powers, and
   spiritual wickednesses in high places; if you will undertake to rescue
   captive sinners out of the devil's paws; do not think that a heedless,
   careless course will accomplish so great a work as this. You must look
   to come off with greater shame and deeper wounds of conscience, than if
   you had lived a common life, if you think to go through such momentous
   things as these with a careless soul. It is not only the work that
   calls for heed, but the workman also, that he may be fit for business
   of such weight. We have seen many men who lived as private Christians,
   in good reputation for parts and piety, when they took upon them either
   the magistracy or military employment, where the work was above their
   gifts, and temptations did overmatch their strength, they proved
   scandalous disgraced men. And we have seen some private Christians of
   good esteem, who, having thought too highly of their parts, and thrust
   themselves into the ministerial office, have proved weak and empty men,
   and have become greater burdens to the Church than some whom we
   endeavored to cast out. They might have done God more service in the
   higher rank of private men, than they do among the lowest of the
   ministry. If, then, you will venture into the midst of enemies, and
   bear the burden and heat of the day, take heed to yourselves.

   7. Take heed to yourselves, for the honor of your Lord and Master, and
   of his holy truth and ways, doth lie more on you than on other men. As
   you may render him more service, so you may do him more disservice than
   others. The nearer men stand to God, the greater dishonor hath he by
   their miscarriages; and the more will they be imputed by foolish men to
   God himself. The heavy judgments executed on Eli and on his house were
   because they kicked at his sacrifice and offering: Therefore was the
   sin of the young men very great before the Lord, for men abhorred the
   offering of the Lord.' It was that great aggravation, of causing the
   enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,' which provoked God to deal more
   sharply with David, than he would otherwise have done. If you be indeed
   Christians, the glory of God will be dearer to you than your lives.
   Take heed therefore what you do against it, as you would take heed what
   you do against your lives. Would it not wound you to the heart to hear
   the name and truth of God reproached for your sakes; to see men point
   to you, and say, There goes a covetous priest, a secret tippler, a
   scandalous man; these are they that preach for strictness, while they
   themselves can live as loose as others; they condemn us by their
   sermons, and condemn themselves by their lives; notwithstanding all
   their talk, they are as bad as we.' O brethren, could your hearts
   endure to hear men cast the dung of your iniquities in the face of the
   holy God, and in the face of the gospel, and of all that desire to fear
   the Lord? Would it not break your hearts to think that all the godly
   Christians about you should suffer reproach for your misdoings? Why, if
   one of you that is a leader of the flock, should be ensnared but once
   into some scandalous crime, there is scarcely a man or woman that
   seeketh diligently after their salvation, within the hearing of it,
   but, besides the grief of their hearts for your sin, are likely to have
   it cast in their teeth by the ungodly about them, however much they may
   detest it, and lament it. The ungodly husband will tell his wife, and
   the ungodly parents will tell their children, and ungodly neighbors and
   fellow-servants will be telling one another of it, saying, These are
   your godly preachers! See what comes of all your stir. What better are
   you than others? You are even all alike.' Such words as these must all
   the godly in the country hear for your sakes. It must needs be that
   offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!' O take
   heed, brethren, of every word you speak, and of every step you tread,
   for you bear the ark of the Lord, -- you are entrusted with his honor!
   If you that know his will, and approve the things that are more
   excellent, being instructed out of the law, and are confident that ye
   yourselves are guides of the blind, and lights to them that are in
   darkness, instructors of the foolish, teachers of babes,' -- if you, I
   say, should live contrary to your doctrine, and by breaking the law
   should dishonor God, the name of God will be blasphemed' among the
   ignorant and ungodly through you.' And you are not unacquainted with
   that standing decree of heaven, Them that honor me I will honor; and
   they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.' Never did man dishonor
   God, but it proved the greatest dishonor to himself. God will find out
   ways enough to wipe off any stain that is cast upon him; but you will
   not so easily remove the shame and sorrow from yourselves.

   8. Lastly, Take heed to yourselves, for the success of all your labors
   doth very much depend upon this. God useth to fit men for great works,
   before he employs them as his instruments in accomplishing them. Now,
   if the work of the Lord be not soundly done upon your own hearts, how
   can you expect that he will bless your labors for effecting it in
   others? He may do it, if he please, but you have much cause to doubt
   whether he will. I shall here mention some reasons which may satisfy
   you, that he who would be a means of saving others, must take heed to
   himself, and that God doth more seldom prosper the labors of
   unsanctified men.

   (1) Can it be expected that God will bless that man's labors, (I mean
   comparatively, as to other ministers) who worketh not for God, but for
   himself? Now, this is the case with every unsanctified man. None but
   converted men do make God their chief end, and do all or any thing
   heartily for his honor; others make the ministry but a trade to live
   by. They choose it rather than another calling, because their parents
   did destine them to it, or because it affordeth them a competent
   maintenance; because it is a life wherein they have more opportunity to
   furnish their intellects with all kind of science; or because it is not
   so toilsome to the body, to those that have a mind to favor their
   flesh; because it is accompanied with some reverence and respect from
   men, and because they think it a fine thing to be leaders and teachers,
   and have others receive the law at their mouth.' For such ends as these
   are they ministers, and for these do they preach; and, were it not for
   these, or similar objects, they would soon give over. And can it be
   expected, that God should much bless the labors of such men as these?
   It is not for him they preach, but themselves, and their own reputation
   or gain. It is not him, but themselves, that they seek and serve; and,
   therefore, no wonder if he leave them to themselves for the success,
   and if their labors have no greater a blessing than themselves can
   give, and if the word reach no further than their own strength can make
   it reach.

   (2) Can you think that he is likely to be as successful as others, who
   dealeth not heartily and faithfully in his work, who believeth not what
   he saith, and is not truly serious when he seemeth to be most diligent?
   And can you think that any unsanctified man can be hearty and serious
   in the ministerial work? A kind of seriousness indeed he may have, such
   as proceedeth from a common faith or opinion, that the Word is true; or
   he may be actuated by a natural fervor, or by selfish ends: but the
   seriousness and fidelity of a sound believer, who ultimately intendeth
   God's glory, and men's salvation, this he hath not. O sirs, all your
   preaching and persuading of others, will be but dreaming and vile
   hypocrisy, till the work be thoroughly done upon your own hearts. How
   can you set yourselves, day and night, to a work that your carnal
   hearts are averse to? How can you call, with serious fervor, upon poor
   sinners to repent and return to God, that never repented or returned
   yourselves? How can you heartily follow poor sinners, with importunate
   solicitations to take heed of sin, and to lead a holy life, that never
   felt yourselves the evil of sin, or the worth of holiness?

   These things are never well known till they are felt, nor well felt
   till they are possessed; and he that feeleth them not himself, is not
   likely to speak feelingly of them to others, nor to help others to the
   feeling of them. How can you follow sinners, with compassion in your
   hearts and tears in your eyes, and beseech them, in the name of the
   Lord, to stop their course, and return and live, and never had so much
   compassion on your own soul, as to do this much for yourselves? What!
   can you love other men better than yourselves? Can you have pity on
   them, who have no pity upon yourselves? Sirs, do you think they will be
   heartily diligent to save men from hell, that be not heartily persuaded
   that there is a hell? Or to bring men to heaven, that do not truly
   believe that there is a heaven? As Calvin saith on my text; For never
   will the man take diligent care for the salvation of others who
   neglects his own salvation.' He that hath not so strong a belief of the
   Word of God, and of the life to come, as will withdraw his own heart
   from the vanities of this world, and excite him to holy diligence for
   salvation, cannot be expected to be faithful in seeking the salvation
   of other men. Surely he that dare damn himself, dare let others alone
   in the way to damnation; he that, like Judas, will sell his Master for
   silver, will not stick to make merchandise of the flock; he that will
   let go his hopes of heaven, rather than leave his worldly and fleshly
   delights, will hardly leave them for the saving of others. We may
   naturally conceive, that he will have no pity on others, that is
   wilfully cruel to himself; that he is not to be trusted with other
   men's souls, who is unfaithful to his own, and will sell it to the
   devil for the short pleasures of sin. I confess that man shall never
   have my consent to have the charge of other men's souls and to oversee
   them in order to their salvation that takes not heed to himself but is
   careless of his own, except it were in case of absolute necessity, that
   no better could be had.

   (3) Do you think it is a likely thing, that he will fight against Satan
   with all his might, who is himself a servant to Satan? Will he do any
   great harm to the kingdom of the devil, who is himself a member and a
   subject of that kingdom? Will he be true to Christ who is in covenant
   with his enemy? Now, this is the case of all unsanctified men, of
   whatsoever rank or profession they be. They are the servants of Satan,
   and the subjects of his kingdom; it is he that ruleth in their hearts;
   and are they like to be true to Christ that are ruled by the devil?
   What prince will choose the friends and servants of his enemy to lead
   his armies in war against him? This is it that hath made so many
   preachers of the gospel to be enemies to the work of the gospel which
   they preach. No wonder if such deride the holy obedience of the
   faithful; and if while they take on them to preach a holy life, they
   cast reproaches on them that practice it! O how many such traitors have
   been in the Church of Christ in all ages, who have done more against
   him, under his colors, than they could have done in the open field!
   They speak well of Christ and of godliness in the general, and yet
   slyly do what they can to bring them into disgrace, and make men
   believe that those who set themselves to seek God with all their hearts
   are a company of enthusiasts or hypocrites. And when they cannot for
   shame speak that way in the pulpit, they will do it in private among
   their acquaintance. Alas! how many such wolves have been set over the
   sheep! If there was a traitor among the twelve in Christ's family, no
   wonder if there be many now. It cannot be expected that a slave of
   Satan, whose god is his belly, and who mindeth earthly things,' should
   be any better than an enemy to the cross of Christ.' What though he
   live civilly, and preach plausibly, and maintain outwardly a profession
   of religion? He may be as fast in the devil's snares, by worldliness,
   pride, a secret distaste of diligent godliness, or by an unsound heart
   that is not rooted in the faith, nor unreservedly devoted to Christ, as
   others are by drunkenness, uncleanness, and similar disgraceful sins.
   Publicans and harlots do sooner enter heaven than Pharisees, because
   they are sooner convinced of their sin and misery.

   And, though many of these men may seem excellent preachers, and may cry
   down sin as loudly as others, yet it is all but an affected fervency,
   and too commonly but a mere useless bawling; for he who cherisheth sin
   in his own heart doth never fall upon it in good earnest in others. I
   know, indeed, that a wicked man may be more willing of the reformation
   of others than of his own, and hence may show a kind of earnestness in
   dissuading them from their evil ways; because he can preach against sin
   at an easier rate than he can forsake it, and another man's reformation
   may consist with his own enjoyment of his lusts. And, therefore, many a
   wicked minister or parent may be earnest with their people or children
   to amend, because they lose not their own sinful profits or pleasures
   by another's reformation, nor doth it call them to that self-denial
   which their own doth. But yet for all this, there is none of that zeal,
   resolution, and diligence, which are found in all that are true to
   Christ. They set not against sin as the enemy of Christ, and as that
   which endangereth their people's souls. A traitorous commander, that
   shooteth nothing against the enemy but powder, may cause his guns to
   make as great a sound or report as those that are loaded with bullets;
   but he doth no hurt to the enemy. So one of these men may speak as
   loudly, and mouth it with an affected fervency, but he seldom doth any
   great execution against sin and Satan. No man can fight well, but where
   he hateth, or is very angry; much less against them whom he loveth, and
   loveth above all. Every unrenewed man is so far from hating sin to
   purpose, that it is his dearest treasure. Hence you may see, that an
   unsanctified man, who loveth the enemy, is very unfit to be a leader in
   Christ's army; and to draw others to renounce the world and the flesh,
   seeing he cleaveth to them himself as his chief good.

   (4) It is not likely that the people will much regard the doctrine of
   such men, when they see that they do not live as they preach. They will
   think that he doth not mean as he speaks, if he do not live as he
   speaks. They will hardly believe a man that seemeth not to believe
   himself. If one bid you run for your lives, because a bear, or an enemy
   is at your backs, and yet do not mend his own pace, you will be tempted
   to think that he is but in jest, and that there is really no such
   danger as he alleges. When preachers tell people of the necessity of
   holiness, and that without it no man shall see the Lord, and yet remain
   unholy themselves, the people will think that they do but talk to pass
   away the hour, and because they must say somewhat for their money, and
   that all these are but words of course. Long enough may you lift up
   your voice against sin, before men will believe that there is any such
   evil or danger in it as you talk of, while they see the same man that
   reproacheth it, cherishing it in his bosom, and making it his delight.
   You rather tempt them to think that there is some special good in it,
   and that you dispraise it as gluttons do a dish which they love, that
   they may have it all to themselves. As long as men have eyes as well as
   ears, they will think they see your meaning as well as hear it; and
   they are apter to believe their sight than their hearing, as being the
   more perfect sense of the two. All that a minister doth, is a kind of
   preaching; and if you live a covetous or a careless life, you preach
   these sins to your people by your practice. If you drink, or game, or
   trifle away your time in vain discourse, they take it as if you said to
   them, Neighbours, this is the life you should all live; on this course
   you may venture without any danger.' If you are ungodly, and teach not
   your families the fear of God, nor contradict the sins of the company
   you are in, nor turn the stream of their vain talking, nor deal with
   them plainly about their salvation, they will take it as if you
   preached to them that such things are needless, and that they may
   boldly do so as well as you. Nay, you do worse than all this, for you
   teach them to think evil of others that are better than yourselves. How
   many a faithful minister, and private Christian, is hated and
   reproached for the sake of such as you! What say the people to them?
   You are so precise, and tell us so much of sin, and duty, and make such
   a stir about these matters, while such or such a minister, that is as
   great a scholar as you, and as good a preacher, will be merry and jest
   with us, and let us alone, and never trouble himself or us with such
   discourse. You can never be quiet, but make more ado than needs; and
   love to frighten men with talk of damnation, when sober, learned,
   peaceable divines are quiet, and live with us like other men.' Such are
   the thoughts and talk of people, which your negligence doth occasion.
   They will give you leave to preach against their sins, and to talk as
   much as you will for godliness in the pulpit, if you will but let them
   alone afterwards, and be friendly and merry with them when you have
   done, and talk as they do, and live as they, and be indifferent with
   them in your conversation. For they take the pulpit to be but a stage;
   a place where preachers must show themselves, and play their parts;
   where you have liberty for an hour to say what you list; and what you
   say they regard not, if you show them not, by saying it personally to
   their faces, that you were in good earnest, and did indeed mean them,
   Is that man then likely to do much good, or fit to be a minister of
   Christ, that will speak for him an hour on the Sabbath, and, by his
   life, will preach against him all the week besides, yea, and give his
   public words the lie?

   And if any of the people be wiser than to follow the examples of such
   men, yet the loathsomeness of their lives will make their doctrine the
   less effectual. Though you know the meat to be good and wholesome, yet
   it may make a weak stomach rise against it, if the cook or the servant
   that carrieth it have leprous or even dirty hands. Take heed therefore
   to yourselves, if ever you mean to do good to others.

   Lastly, Consider whether the success of your labors depends not on the
   assistance and blessing of the Lord. And where hath he made any promise
   of his assistance and blessing to ungodly men? If he do promise his
   Church a blessing even by such, yet doth he not promise them any
   blessing. To his faithful servants he hath promised that he will be
   with them, that he will put his Spirit upon them, and his word into
   their mouths, and that Satan shall fall before them as lightning from
   heaven. But where is there any such promise to ungodly ministers? Nay,
   do you not, by your hypocrisy and your abuse of God, provoke him to
   forsake you, and to blast all your endeavors, at least as to
   yourselves,' though he may bless them to his chosen? For I do not deny
   but that God may do good to his Church by wicked men; yet doth he it
   not so ordinarily, nor so eminently, as by his own servants. And what I
   have said of the wicked themselves, doth hold in part of the godly,
   while they are scandalous and backsliding, in proportion to the measure
   of their sin.

CHAPTER 2

THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FLOCK
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 1 -- THE NATURE OF THIS OVERSIGHT

   Having showed you, What it is to take heed to ourselves, I am to show
   you, next, What it is to take heed to all the flock.

   It was first necessary to take into consideration, what we must be, and
   what we must do for our own souls, before we come to that which must be
   done for others: He cannot succeed in healing the wounds of others who
   is himself unhealed by reason of neglecting himself. He neither
   benefits his neighbors nor himself. He does not raise up others, but
   himself falls.' Yea, lest all his labors come to naught, because his
   heart and life are naught that doth perform them. For some persons
   there are who, though expert in spiritual ministry, go about it in a
   headstrong manner, and while acting intelligently, tread underfoot any
   good they do. They teach too hurriedly what can only be rendered holy
   by meditation; and what they proclaim in public they impugn by their
   conduct. Whence it is that as pastors they walk in paths too rugged for
   the flock to follow.' When we have led them to the living waters, if we
   muddy it by our filthy lives, we may lose our labor, and they be never
   the better. Before we speak of the work itself, we shall notice
   somewhat that is pre-supposed in the words before us.

   1. It is here implied, that every flock should have its own pastor, and
   every pastor his own flock. As every troop or company in a regiment of
   soldiers must have its own captain and other officers, and every
   soldier knows his own commander and colors; so it is the will of God,
   that every church should have its own pastor, and that all Christ's
   disciples should know their teachers that are over them in the Lord.'
   Though a minister is an officer in the Church universal, yet is he in a
   special manner the overseer of that particular church which is
   committed to his charge. When we are ordained ministers without a
   special charge, we are licensed and commanded to do our best for all,
   as we shall have opportunity for the exercise of our gifts: but when we
   have undertaken a particular charge, we have restrained the exercise of
   our gifts so specially to that congregation, that we must allow others
   no more than it can spare of our time and help, except where the public
   good requireth it, which must, no doubt, be first regarded. From this
   relation of pastor and flock, arise all the duties which they mutually
   owe to each other.

   2. When we are commanded to take heed to all the flock, it is plainly
   implied, that flocks must ordinarily be no greater than we are capable
   of overseeing, or taking heed to.' God will not lay upon us natural
   impossibilities: he will not bind men to leap up to the moon, to touch
   the stars, or to number the sands of the sea. If the pastoral office
   consists in overseeing all the flock, then surely the number of souls
   under the care of each pastor must not be greater than he is able to
   take such heed to as is here required. Will God require one bishop to
   take the charge of a whole county, or of so many parishes or thousands
   of souls, as he is not able to know or to oversee? Yea, and to take the
   sole government of them, while the particular teachers of them are free
   from that undertaking? Will God require the blood of so many parishes
   at one man's hands, if he do not that which ten, or twenty, or a
   hundred, or three hundred men can no more do, than I can move a
   mountain Then woe to poor prelates! Is it not, then, a most doleful
   case, that learned, sober men should plead for this as a desirable
   privilege; that they should wilfully draw on themselves such a burden;
   and that they do not rather tremble at the thoughts of so great an
   undertaking? O, happy had it been for the Church, and happy for the
   bishops themselves, if this measure, that is intimated by the apostle
   here, had still been observed: that the diocese had been no greater
   than the elders or bishops could oversee and rule, so that they might
   have taken heed to all the Rock: or that pastors had been multiplied as
   churches increased, and the number of overseers been proportioned to
   the number of souls, that they might not have let the work be undone,
   while they assumed the empty titles, and undertook impossibilities! And
   that they had rather prayed the Lord of the harvest to send forth more
   laborers, even so many as were proportioned to the work, and not to
   have undertaken all themselves. I should scarcely commend the prudence
   or humility of that laborer, let his parts be ever so great, that would
   not only undertake to gather in all the harvest in this county himself,
   and that upon pain of death, yea, of damnation, but would also
   earnestly contend for this prerogative.

   But it may be said, there are others to teach, though one only have the
   rule.

   To this I answer: Blessed be God it is so; and no thanks to some of
   them. But is not government of great concernment to the good of souls,
   as well as preaching? If it be no, then what use is there for church
   governors? If it be, then they that nullify it by undertaking
   impossibilities, do go about to ruin the churches and themselves. If
   only preaching be necessary, let us have none but mere preachers: what
   needs there then such a stir about government? But if discipline, in
   its place, be necessary too, what is it but enmity to men's salvation
   to exclude it? and it is unavoidably excluded, when it is made to be
   his work that is naturally incapable of performing it. The general that
   will command an army alone, may as well say, Let it be destroyed for
   want of command: and the schoolmaster that will oversee or govern all
   the schools in the county alone, may as well say, Let them all be
   ungoverned: and the physician that will undertake the care of all the
   sick people in a whole nation, or county, when he is not able to visit
   the hundredth man of them, may as well say, Let them perish. Yet still
   it must be acknowledged, that in case of necessity, where there are not
   more to be had, one man may undertake the charge of more souls than he
   is well able to oversee particularly. But then he must undertake only
   to do what he can for them, and not to do all that a pastor ordinarily
   ought to do. This is the case of some of us, who have greater parishes
   than we are able to take that special heed to which their state
   requireth. I profess for my own part, I am so far from their boldness
   that dare venture on the sole government of a county, that I would not,
   for all England, have undertaken to be one of the two that should do
   all the pastoral work that God requireth, in the parish where I live,
   had I not this to satisfy my conscience, that, through the Church's
   necessities, more cannot be had; and therefore, I must rather do what I
   can, than leave all undone because I cannot do all. But cases of
   unavoidable necessity are not to be the ordinary condition of the
   Church; or at least, it is not desirable that it should so be. O happy
   Church of Christ, were the laborers but able and faithful, and
   proportioned in number to the number of souls; so that the pastors were
   so many, or the particular churches so small, that we might be able to
   take heed to all the flock.' Having noticed these things, which are
   presupposed, we shall now proceed to consider the duty which is
   recommended in the text, Take heed to all the flock. It is, you see,
   all the flock, or every individual member of our charge. To this end it
   is necessary, that we should know every person that belongeth to our
   charge; for how can we take heed to them, if we do not know them? We
   must labor to be acquainted, not only with the persons, but with the
   state of all our people, with their inclinations and conversations;
   what are the sins of which they are most in danger, and what duties
   they are most apt to neglect, and what temptations they are most liable
   to; for if we know not their temperament or disease, we are not likely
   to prove successful physicians.

   Being thus acquainted with all the flock, we must afterward take heed
   to them. One would imagine that every reasonable man would be satisfied
   of this, and that it would need no further proof. Doth not a careful
   shepherd look after every individual sheep? and a good schoolmaster
   after every individual scholar? and a good physician after every
   particular patient? and a good commander after every individual
   soldier? Why then should not the shepherds, the teachers, the
   physicians, the guides of the churches of Christ, take heed to every
   individual member of their charge? Christ himself, the great and good
   Shepherd, that hath the whole to look after, doth yet take care of
   every individual; like him whom he describes in the parable, who left
   the ninety and nine sheep in the wilderness, to seek after one that was
   lost.' The prophets were often sent to single men. Ezekiel was made a
   watchman over individuals, and was commanded to say to the wicked, Thou
   shalt surely die.' Paul taught his hearers not only publicly but from
   house to house,' and in another place he tells us, that he warned every
   man, and taught every man, in all wisdom, that he might present every
   man perfect in Christ Jesus.' Many other passages of Scripture make it
   evident that it is our duty to take heed to every individual of our
   flock; and many passages in the ancient Councils do plainly show that
   this was the practice of the primitive times. But I shall quote only
   one from Ignatius: Let assemblies,' says he, be often gathered; inquire
   after all by name: despise not servant-men or maids.' You see it was
   then considered as a duty to look after every member of the flock by
   name, not excepting the meanest servant-man or maid. But, some one may
   object, The congregation that I am set over is so great that it is
   impossible for me to know them all, much more to take heed to all
   individually.' To this answer, Is it necessity or is it not, that hath
   cast you upon such a charge? If it be not, you excuse one sin by
   another. How durst you undertake that which you knew yourself unable to
   perform, when you were not forced to it? It would seem you had some
   other ends in undertaking it, and never intended to be faithful to your
   trust. But if you think that you were necessitated to undertake it, I
   would ask you, might you not have procured assistance for so great a
   charge? Have you done all that you could with your friends and
   neighbors, to get maintenance for another to help you? Have you not as
   much maintenance yourself, as might serve yourself and another? What
   though it will not serve to maintain you in fullness? Is it not more
   reasonable that you should pinch your flesh and family, then undertake
   a work that you cannot perform, and neglect the souls of so many of
   your flock? I know, that what I say will seem hard to some; but to me
   it is an unquestionable thing, that, if you have but a hundred pounds a
   year, it is your duty to live upon part of it, and allow the rest to a
   competent assistant, rather than that the flock which you are over
   should be neglected. If you say, that is a hard measure, and that your
   wife and children cannot so live, I answer, Do not many families in
   your parish live on less? Have not many able ministers in the prelates'
   days been glad of less, with liberty to preach the gospel? There are
   some yet living, as I have heard, who have offered the bishops to enter
   into bond to preach for nothing, if they might but have liberty to
   preach the gospel. If you shall still say, that you cannot live so
   meanly as poor people do, I further ask, Can your parishioners better
   endure damnation, than you can endure want and poverty? What! do you
   call yourselves ministers of the gospel, and yet are the souls of men
   so base in your eyes, that you had rather they should eternally perish,
   than that you and your family should live in a low and poor condition?
   Nay, should you not rather beg your bread, than put so great a matter
   as men's salvation upon a hazard, or disadvantage? Yea, as hazard the
   damnation of but one soul? O sirs, it is a miserable thing when men
   study and talk of heaven and hell, and the fewness of the saved, and
   the difficulty of salvation, and be not all the while in good earnest.
   If you were, you could never surely stick at such matters as these, and
   let your people go down to hell, that you might live in higher style in
   this world. Remember this, the next time you are preaching to them,
   that they cannot be saved without knowledge; and hearken whether
   conscience does not tell you, It is likely they might be brought to
   knowledge, if they had but diligent instruction and exhortation
   privately, man by man; and if there were another minister to assist me,
   this might be done: and if I would live sparingly and deny my flesh, I
   might have an assistant. Dare I, then, let my people live in that
   ignorance which I myself have told them is damning, rather than put
   myself and family to a little want?'

   Must I turn to my Bible to show a preacher where it is written, that a
   man's soul is worth more than a world, much more therefore than a
   hundred pounds a year, much more are many souls more worth? Or that
   both we and all that we have are God's, and should be employed to the
   utmost for his service? Or that it is inhuman cruelty to let souls go
   to hell, for fear my wife and children should fare somewhat the harder,
   or live at lower rates; when, according to God's ordinary way of
   working by means, I might do much to prevent their misery, if I would
   but a little displease my flesh, which all, who are Christ's, have
   crucified with its lusts? Every man must render to God the things that
   are God's, and that, let it be remembered, is all he is and all he
   possesses. How are all things sanctified to us, but in the separation
   and dedication of them to God? Are they not all his talents, and must
   be employed in his service? Must not every Christian first ask, In what
   way may I most honor God with my substance? Do we not preach these
   things to our people? Are they true as to them, and not as to us? Yea
   more, is not the church-maintenance devoted, in a special manner, to
   the service of God for the church? And should we not then use it for
   the utmost furtherance of that end? If any minister who hath two
   hundred pounds a year can prove that a hundred pounds of it may do God
   more service, if it be laid out on himself, or wife and children, than
   if it maintain one or two suitable assistants to help forward the
   salvation of the flock, I shall not presume to reprove his expenses;
   but where this cannot be proved, let not the practice be justified. And
   I must further say, that this poverty is not so intolerable and
   dangerous a thing as it is pretended to be. If you have but food and
   raiment, must you not therewith be content? and what would you have
   more than that which may fit you for the work of God? It is not being
   clothed in purple and fine linen, and faring sumptuously every day,'
   that is necessary for this end. A man's life consisteth not in the
   abundance of the things that he possesseth.' If your clothing be warm,
   and your food be wholesome, you may be as well supported by it to do
   God service as if you had the fullest satisfaction to your flesh. A
   patched coat may be warm, and bread and water are wholesome food. He
   that wanteth not these, hath but a poor excuse to make for hazarding
   men's souls, that he may live on dainties.

   But, while it is our duty to take heed to all the flock, we must pay
   special attention to some classes in particular. By many, this is very
   imperfectly understood, and therefore I shall dwell a little upon it.

   1. We must labor, in a special manner, for the conversion of the
   unconverted.

   The work of conversion is the first and great thing we must drive at;
   after this we must labor with all our might. Alas! the misery of the
   unconverted is so great, that it calleth loudest to us for compassion.
   If a truly converted sinner do fall, it will be but into sin which will
   be pardoned, and he is not in that hazard of damnation by it as others
   are. Not but that God hateth their sins as well as others', or that he
   will bring them to heaven, let them live ever so wickedly; but the
   spirit that is within them will not suffer them to live wickedly, nor
   to sin as the ungodly do. But with the unconverted it is far otherwise.
   They are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity,' and
   have yet no part nor fellowship in the pardon of their sins, or the
   hope of glory. We have, therefore, a work of greater necessity to do or
   them, even to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
   and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness
   of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified.' He that
   seeth one man sick of a mortal disease, and another only pained with
   the toothache, will be moved more to compassionate the former, than the
   latter; and will surely make more haste to help him, though he were a
   stranger, and the other a brother or a son. It is so sad a case to see
   men in a state of damnation, wherein, if they should die, they are lost
   for ever, that methinks we should not be able to let them alone, either
   in public or private, whatever other work we may have to do. I confess,
   I am frequently forced to neglect that which should tend to the further
   increase of knowledge in the godly, because of the lamentable necessity
   of the unconverted. Who is able to talk of controversies, or of nice
   unnecessary points, or even of truths of a lower degree of necessity,
   how excellent soever, while he seeth a company of ignorant, carnal,
   miserable sinners before his eyes, who must be changed or damned?
   Methinks I even see them entering upon their final woe! Methinks I hear
   them crying out for help, for speediest help! Their misery speaks the
   louder, because they have not hearts to ask for themselves. Many a time
   have I known, that I had some hearers of higher fancies, that looked
   for rarities, and were addicted to despise the ministry, if I told them
   not somewhat more than ordinary; and yet I could not find in my heart
   to turn from the necessities of the impenitent, for the humouring of
   them; nor even to leave speaking to miserable sinners for their
   salvation, in order to speak to such novelists; no, nor so much as
   should otherwise be done, to weak saints for their confirmation and
   increase in grace. Methinks, as Paul's spirit was stirred within him,
   when he saw the Athenians wholly given to idolatry,' so it should cast
   us into one of his paroxysms, to see so many men in the utmost danger
   of being everlastingly undone. Methinks, if by faith we did indeed look
   upon them as within a step of hell, it would more effectually untie our
   tongues, than Croesus' danger, as they tell us, did his son's. He that
   will let a sinner go down to hell for want of speaking to him, doth set
   less by souls than did the Redeemer of souls; and less by his neighbor,
   than common charity will allow him to do by his greatest enemy. O,
   therefore, brethren, whomsoever you neglect, neglect not the most
   miserable! Whatever you pass over, forget not poor souls that are under
   the condemnation and curse of the law, and who may look every hour for
   the infernal execution, if a speedy change do not prevent it. O call
   after the impenitent, and ply this great work of converting souls,
   whatever else you leave undone.

   2. We must be ready to give advice to inquirers, who come to us with
   cases of conscience; especially the great case which the Jews put to
   Peter, and the gaoler to Paul and Silas, What must we do to be saved?'
   A minister is not to be merely a public preacher, but to be known as a
   counsellor for their souls, as the physician is for their bodies, and
   the lawyer for their estates: so that each man who is in doubts and
   straits, may bring his case to him for resolution; as Nicodemus came to
   Christ, and as it was usual with the people of old to go to the priest,
   whose lips must keep knowledge, and at whose mouth they must ask the
   law, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.' But as the
   people have become unacquainted with this office of the ministry, and
   with their own duty and necessity in this respect, it belongeth to us
   to acquaint them with it, and publicly to press them to come to us for
   advice about the great concerns of their souls. We must not only be
   willing to take the trouble, but should draw it upon ourselves, by
   inviting them to come. What abundance of good might we do, could we but
   bring them to this! And, doubtless, much might be done in it, if we did
   our duty. How few have I ever heard of, who have heartily pressed their
   people to their duty in this way! Oh! it is a sad case that men's souls
   should be so injured and hazarded by the total neglect of so great a
   duty, and that ministers should scarcely ever tell them of it, and
   awaken them to it. Were your hearers but duly sensible of the need and
   importance of this, you would have them more frequently knocking at
   your doors, and making known to you their sad complaints, and begging
   your advice. I beseech you, then, press them more to this duty for the
   future; and see that you perform it carefully when they do seek your
   help. To this end it is very necessary that you be well acquainted with
   practical cases, and especially that you be acquainted with the nature
   of saving grace, and able to assist them in trying their state, and in
   resolving the main question that concerns their everlasting life or
   death. One word of seasonable, prudent advice, given by a minister to
   persons in necessity, may be of more use than many sermons. A word
   fitly spoken,' says Solomon, how good is it!'

   3. We must study to build up those who are already truly converted. In
   this respect our work is various, according to the various states of
   Christians.

   (1) There are many of our flock that are young and weak, who, though
   they are of long standing, are yet of small proficiency or strength.
   This, indeed, is the most common condition of the godly. Most of them
   content themselves with low degrees of grace, and it is no easy matter
   to get them higher. To bring them to higher and stricter opinions is
   easy, that is, to bring them from the truth into error, on the right
   hand as well as on the left; but to increase their knowledge and gifts
   is not easy, and to increase their graces is the hardest of all. It is
   a very sad thing for Christians to be weak: it exposeth us to dangers;
   it abateth our consolations and delight in God, and taketh off the
   sweetness of wisdom's ways; it maketh us less serviceable to God and
   man, to bring less honor to our Master, and to do less good to all
   about us. We get small benefit in the use of the means of grace. We too
   easily play with the serpent's baits, and are ensnared by his wiles. A
   seducer will easily shake us, and evil may be made to appear to us as
   good, truth as falsehood, sin as duty; and so on the contrary. We are
   less able to resist and stand in an encounter; we sooner fall; we
   hardlier rise; and are apter to prove a scandal and reproach to our
   profession. We less know ourselves, and are more apt to be mistaken as
   to our own estate, not observing corruptions when they have got
   advantage of us. We are dishonorable to the gospel by our very
   weakness, and little useful to any about us. In a word, though we live
   to less profit to ourselves or others, yet are we unwilling and too
   unready to die.

   Now, seeing the case of weakness in the converted is so sad, how
   diligent should we be to cherish and increase their grace! The strength
   of Christians is the honor of the Church. When they are inflamed with
   the love of God, and live by a lively working faith, and set light by
   the profits and honors of the world, and love one another with a pure
   heart fervently, and can bear and heartily forgive a wrong, and suffer
   joyfully for the cause of Christ, and study to do good, and walk
   inoffensively and harmlessly in the world, are ready to be servants to
   all men for their good, becoming all things to all men in order to win
   them to Christ, and yet abstaining from the appearance of evil, and
   seasoning all their actions with a sweet mixture of prudence, humility,
   zeal, and heavenly mindedness - oh, what an honor are such to their
   profession! What an ornament to the Church; and how serviceable to God
   and man! Men would sooner believe that the gospel is from heaven, if
   they saw more such effects of it upon the hearts and lives of those who
   profess it. The world is better able to read the nature of religion in
   a man's life than in the Bible. They that obey not the word, may be won
   by the conversation' of such as are thus eminent for godliness. It is,
   therefore, a most important part of our work, to labor more in the
   polishing and perfecting of the saints, that they may be strong in the
   Lord, and fitted for their Master's service.

   (2) Another class of converts that need our special help, are those who
   labor under some particular corruption, which keeps under their graces,
   and makes them a trouble to others, and a burden to themselves. Alas!
   there are too many such persons. Some are specially addicted to pride,
   and others to worldly-mindedness; some to sensual desires, and others
   to frowardness or other evil passions. Now it is our duty to give
   assistance to all these; and partly by dissuasions, and clear
   discoveries of the odiousness of the sin, and partly by suitable
   directions about the remedy, to help them to a more complete conquest
   of their corruptions. We are leaders of Christ's army against the
   powers of hell, and must resist all the works of darkness wherever we
   find them, even though it should be in the children of light. We must
   be no more tender of the sins of the godly, than of the ungodly, nor
   any more befriend them or favor them. By how much more we love their
   persons, by so much the more must we manifest it, by making opposition
   to their sins. And yet we must look to meet with some tender persons
   here, especially when iniquity hath got any head, and made a party, and
   many have fallen in love with it; they will be as pettish and as
   impatient of reproof as some worse men, and perhaps will interest even
   piety itself in their faults. But the ministers of Christ must do their
   duty, notwithstanding their peevishness; and must not so far hate their
   brother, as to forbear rebuking him, or suffer sin to lie upon his
   soul. It must, no doubt, be done with much prudence, yet done it must
   be.

   (3) Another class who demand special help are declining Christians,
   that are either fallen into some scandalous sin, or else abate their
   zeal and diligence, and show that they have lost their former love. As
   the case of backsliders is very sad, so our diligence must be very
   great for their recovery. It is sad to them to lose so much of their
   life, and peace, and serviceableness to God; and to become so
   serviceable to Satan and his cause. It is sad to us to see that all our
   labor is come to this; and that, when we have taken so much pains with
   them, and have had so much hopes of them, all should be so far
   frustrated. It is saddest of all, to think that God should be so
   dishonored by those whom he hath so loved, and for whom he hath done so
   much; and that Christ should be so wounded in the house of his friends.
   Besides, partial backsliding hath a natural tendency to total apostasy,
   and would effect it, if special grace did not prevent it. Now, the more
   sad the case of such Christians is, the more must we exert ourselves
   for their recovery. We must restore those that are overtaken in a
   fault, in the spirit of meekness,' and yet see that the sore be
   thoroughly searched and healed, and the joint be well set again, what
   pain soever it may cost. We must look especially to the honor of the
   gospel, and see that they give such evidence of true repentance, and
   make such free and full confession of their sin, that some reparation
   be thereby made to the Church and their holy profession, for the wound
   they have given to religion. Much skill is required for restoring such
   a soul.

   (4) The last class whom I shall here notice, as requiring our
   attention, are the strong; for they, also, have need of our assistance:
   partly to preserve the grace they have; partly to help them in making
   further progress; and partly to direct them in improving their strength
   for the service of Christ, and the assistance of their brethren; and,
   also, to encourage them to persevere, that they may receive the crown.

   All these are the objects of the ministerial work, and in respect to
   each of them, we must take heed to all the flock.'

   4. We must have a special eye upon families, to see that they are well
   ordered, and the duties of each relation performed. The life of
   religion, and the welfare and glory of both the Church and the State,
   depend much on family government and duty. If we suffer the neglect of
   this, we shall undo all. What are we like to do ourselves to the
   reforming of a congregation, if all the work be cast on us alone; and
   masters of families neglect that necessary duty of their own, by which
   they are bound to help us? If any good be begun by the ministry in any
   soul, a careless, prayerless, worldly family is like to stifle it, or
   very much hinder it; whereas, if you could but get the rulers of
   families to do their duty, to take up the work where you left it, and
   help it on, what abundance of good might be done! I beseech you,
   therefore, if you desire the reformation and welfare of your people, do
   all you can to promote family religion. To this end, let me entreat you
   to attend to the following things:

   (1) Get information how each family is ordered, that you may know how
   to proceed in your endeavors for their further good.

   (2) Go occasionally among them, when they are likely to be most at
   leisure, and ask the master of the family whether he prays with them,
   and reads the Scripture, or what he doth? Labor to convince such as
   neglect this, of their sin; and if you have opportunity, pray with them
   before you go, and give them an example of what you would have them do.
   Perhaps, too, it might be well to get a promise from them, that they
   will make more conscience of their duty for the future.

   (3) If you find any, through ignorance and want of practice, unable to
   pray, persuade them to study their own wants, and to get their hearts
   affected with them, and, in the meanwhile, advise them to use a form of
   prayer, rather than not pray at all. Tell them, however, that it is
   their sin and shame that they have lived so negligently, as to be so
   unacquainted with their own necessities as not to know how to speak to
   God in prayer, when every beggar can find words to ask an alms; and,
   therefore, that a form of prayer is but for necessity, as a crutch to a
   cripple, while they cannot do well without it; but that they must
   resolve not to be content with it, but to learn to do better as
   speedily as possible, seeing that prayer should come from the feelings
   of the heart, and be varied according to our necessities and
   circumstances.

   (4) See that in every family there are some useful moving books, beside
   the Bible. If they have none, persuade them to buy some: if they be not
   able to buy them, give them some if you can. If you are not able
   yourself, get some gentlemen, or other rich persons, that are ready to
   good works, to do it. And engage them to read them at night, when they
   have leisure, and especially on the Lord's day.

   (5) Direct them how to spend the Lord's day; how to despatch their
   worldly business, so as to prevent encumbrances and distractions; and
   when they have been at church, how to spend the time in their families.
   The life of religion dependeth much on this, because poor people have
   no other free considerable time; and, therefore, if they lose this,
   they lose all, and will remain ignorant and brutish. Persuade the
   master of every family to cause his children and servants to repeat the
   Catechism to him, every Sabbath evening, and to give him some account
   of what they have heard at church during the day. Neglect not, I
   beseech you, this important part of your work. Get masters of families
   to do their duty, and they will not only spare you a great deal of
   labor, but will much further the success of your labors. If a captain
   can get the officers under him to do their duty, he may rule the
   soldiers with much less trouble, than if all lay upon his own
   shoulders. You are not like to see any general reformation, till you
   procure family reformation. Some little religion there may be, here and
   there; but while it is confined to single persons, and is not promoted
   in families, it will not prosper, nor promise much future increase.

   5. We must be diligent in visiting the sick, and helping them to
   prepare either for a fruitful life, or a happy death. Though this
   should be the business of all our life and theirs, yet doth it, at such
   a season, require extraordinary care both of them and us. When time is
   almost gone, and they must now or never be reconciled to God, oh, how
   doth it concern them to redeem those hours, and to lay hold on eternal
   life! And when we see that we are like to have but a few days or hours
   more to speak to them, in order to their everlasting welfare, who, that
   is not a block or an infidel, would not be much with them, and do all
   he can for their salvation in that short space? Will it not awaken us
   to compassion, to look on a languishing man, and to think that within a
   few days his soul will be in heaven or in hell? Surely it will try the
   faith and seriousness of ministers, to be much about dying men! They
   will thus have opportunity to discern whether they themselves are in
   good earnest about the matters of the life to come. So great is the
   change that is made by death, that it should awaken us to the greatest
   sensibility to see a man so near it, and should excite in us the
   deepest pangs of compassion, to do the office of inferior angels for
   the soul, before it departs from the body, that it may be ready for the
   convoy of superior angels to the inheritance of the saints in light.'
   When a man is almost at his journey's end, and the next step brings him
   to heaven or hell, it is time for us, while there is hope, to help him
   if we can.

   And as their present necessity should move us to embrace that
   opportunity for their good, so should the advantage that sickness and
   the prospect of death affordeth. Even the stoutest sinners will hear us
   on their death-bed, though they scorned us before. They will then let
   fall their fury, and be as gentle as lambs, who were before as
   untractable as lions. I find not one in ten, of the most obstinate
   scornful wretches in my parish, but when they come to die, will humble
   themselves, confess their faults, and seem penitent, and promise, if
   they should recover, to reform their lives. Cyprian saith to those in
   health, He who everyday reminds himself that he is dying, despises the
   present and hastens to things to come. Much more he who feels himself
   to be in the very act of dying.' O how resolvedly will the worst of
   sinners seem to cast away their sins and promise reformation, and cry
   out of their folly, and of the vanity of this world, when they see that
   death is in good earnest with them, and away they must without delay!
   Perhaps you will say, that these forced changes are not cordial, and
   that, therefore, we have no great hope of doing them any saving good. I
   confess it is very common for sinners to be frightened into ineffectual
   purposes, but not so common to be at such a season converted to the
   Savior. It is a remark of Augustine, He cannot die badly who lives
   well; and scarcely shall he die well who lives badly.' Yet scarcely'
   and never' are not all one. It should make both them and us the more
   diligent in the time of health, because it is scarcely'; but yet we
   should bestir us at the last, in the use of the best remedies, because
   it is not never'.

   But as I do not intend to furnish a directory for the whole ministerial
   work, I will not stop to tell you particularly what must be done for
   men in their last extremity; but shall notice only three or four
   things, as specially worthy of your attention.

   (1) Stay not till their strength and understanding are gone, and the
   time so short that you scarcely know what to do; but go to them as soon
   as you hear they are sick, whether they send for you or not.(2) When
   the time is so short, that there is no opportunity to instruct them in
   the principles of religion in order, be sure to ply the main points,
   and to dwell on those truths which are most calculated to promote their
   conversion, showing them the glory of the life to come, and the way by
   which it was purchased for us, and the great sin and folly of their
   having neglected it in time of health; but yet the possibility that
   remaineth of their still obtaining it, if they will believe in Christ,
   the only Savior, and repent of their sins.(3) If they recover, be sure
   to remind them of their promises and resolutions in time of sickness.
   Go to them purposely to set these home to their consciences; and
   whenever, afterwards, you see them remiss, go to them, and put them in
   mind of what they said when they were stretched on a sick-bed. And
   because it is of such use to them who recover, and hath been the means
   of the conversion of many a soul, it is very necessary that you go to
   them whose sickness is not mortal, as well as to those who are dying,
   that so you may have some advantage to move them to repentance, and may
   afterward have this to plead against their sins; as a bishop of Cologne
   is said to have answered the Emperor Sigismund, when he asked him what
   was the way to be saved, He must be what he purposed, or promised to
   be, when he was last troubled with the stone and the gout.'

   6. We must reprove and admonish those who live offensively or
   impenitently. Before we bring such matters before the church, or its
   rulers, it is ordinarily most fit for the minister to try himself what
   he can do in private to bow the sinner to repentance, especially if it
   be not a public crime. Here there is required much skill, and a
   difference must be made, according to the various tempers of the
   offenders; but with the most it will be necessary to speak with the
   greatest plainness and power, to shake their careless hearts, and make
   them see what it is to dally with sin; to let them know the evil of it,
   and its sad effects as regards both God and themselves.

   7. The last part of our oversight, which I shall notice, consisteth in
   the exercise of Church discipline. This consisteth, after the aforesaid
   private reproofs, in more public reproof, combined with exhortation to
   repentance, in prayer for the offender, in restoring the penitent, and
   in excluding and avoiding the impenitent.

   (1) In the case of public offenses, and even of those of a more private
   nature, when the offender remains impenitent, he must be reproved
   before all, and again invited to repentance. This is not the less our
   duty, because we have made so little conscience of the practice of it.
   It is not only Christ's command to tell the church, but Paul's to
   rebuke before all,' and the Church did constantly practice it, till
   selfishness and formality caused them to be remiss in this and other
   duties. There is no room to doubt whether this be our duty, and as
   little is there any ground to doubt whether we have been unfaithful as
   to the performance of it. Many of us, who would be ashamed to omit
   preaching or praying half so much, have little considered what we are
   doing, while living in the wilful neglect of this duty, and other parts
   of discipline, so long as we have done. We little think how we have
   drawn the guilt of swearing, and drunkenness, and fornication, and
   other crimes upon our own heads, by neglecting to use the means which
   God has appointed for the cure of them.

   If any shall say, There is little likelihood that public reproof will
   do them good, that they will rather be enraged by the shame of it; I
   answer -

   [a] It ill becomes a creature to implead the ordinances of God as
   useless, or to reproach God's service instead of doing it, and to set
   his wits in opposition to his Maker. God can render useful his own
   ordinances, or else he would never have appointed them.

   [b] The usefulness of discipline is apparent, in the shaming of sin and
   humbling the sinner, and in manifesting the holiness of Christ, and of
   his doctrine and Church, before all the world.

   [c] What will you do with such sinners? Will you give them up as
   hopeless? That would be more cruel than administering reproof to them.
   Will you use other means? Why, it is supposed that all other means have
   been used without success; for this is the last remedy.

   [d] The principal use of this public discipline is not for the offender
   himself, but for the Church. It tendeth exceedingly to deter others
   from the like crimes, and so to keep the congregation and their worship
   pure. Seneca could say, He who excuses present evils transmits them to
   posterity.' And elsewhere, He who spares the guilty harms the good.'(2)
   With reproof we must join exhortation of the offender to repentance,
   and to the public profession of it for the satisfaction of the church.
   As the church is bound to avoid communion with impenitent scandalous
   sinners, so, when they have had evidence of their sin, they must also
   have some evidence of their repentance; for we cannot know them to be
   penitent without evidence; and what evidence can the church have but
   their profession of repentance, and afterwards their actual reformation
   Much prudence, I confess, is to be exercised in such proceedings, lest
   we do more hurt than good; but it must be such Christian prudence as
   ordereth duties, and suiteth them to their ends, not such carnal
   prudence as shall enervate or exclude them. In performing this duty, we
   should deal humbly, even when we deal most sharply, and make it appear
   that it is not from any ill will, nor any lordly disposition, nor from
   revenge for any injury, but a necessary duty which we cannot
   conscientiously neglect; and, therefore, it may be meet to show the
   people the commands of God obliging us to do what we do, in some such
   words as the following: Brethren, sin is so hateful an evil in the eyes
   of the most holy God, how light soever impenitent sinners make of it,
   that he hath provided the everlasting torments of hell for the
   punishment of it; and no lesser means can prevent that punishment than
   the sacrifice of the Son of God, applied to those who truly repent of
   and forsake it; and therefore God, who calleth all men to repentance,
   hath commanded us to "exhort one another daily, while it is called
   To-day, lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,"
   (Hebrews 3.13) and that we do not hate our brother in our heart, but in
   any wise rebuke our neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him, (Leviticus
   19.17) and that if our brother offend us, we should tell him his fault
   between him and us; and if he hear us not, we should take two or three
   more with us; and if he hear not them, we should tell the church; and
   if he hear not the church, he must be to us as a heathen man and a
   publican; (Matthew 18.15-17) and those that sin, we must rebuke before
   all, that others may fear, (1 Timothy 5.20) and rebuke with all
   authority: (Titus 2.15) yea, were it an apostle of Christ that should
   sin openly, he must be reproved openly, as Paul did Peter; (Galatians
   2.11,14) and if they repent not, we must avoid them, and with such not
   so much as eat, (2 Thessalonians 3.6, 11, 12, 14; 1 Corinthians
   5:11-13.)

   Having heard of the scandalous conduct of A. B. of this church, or
   parish, and having received sufficient proof that he hath committed the
   odious sin of -, we have seriously dealt with him to bring him to
   repentance; but, to the grief of our hearts, we perceive no
   satisfactory result of our endeavors; but he seemeth still to remain
   impenitent (or he still liveth in the same sin, though he verbally
   professes repentance). We therefore judge it our duty to proceed to the
   use of that further remedy which Christ hath commanded us to try; and
   hence we beseech him, in the name of the Lord, without further delay,
   to lay to heart the greatness of his sin, the wrong he hath done to
   Christ and to himself, and the scandal and grief that he hath caused to
   others. And I do earnestly beseech him, for the sake of his own soul,
   that he will consider, what it is that he can gain by his sin and
   impenitency, and whether it will pay for the loss of everlasting life;
   and how he thinks to stand before God in judgment, or to appear before
   the Lord Jesus, when death shall snatch his soul from his body, if he
   be found in this impenitent state. And I do beseech him, for the sake
   of his own soul, and, as a messenger of Jesus Christ, require him, as
   he will answer the contrary at the bar of God, that he lay aside the
   stoutness and impenitency of his heart, and unfeignedly confess and
   lament his sin before God and this congregation. And this desire I here
   publish, not out of any ill will to his person, as the Lord knoweth,
   but in love to his soul, and in obedience to Christ, who hath made it
   my duty; desiring that, if it be possible, he may be saved from his
   sin, and from the power of Satan, and from the everlasting wrath of
   God, and may be reconciled to God and to his church; and, therefore,
   that he may be humbled by true contrition, before he be humbled by
   remediless condemnation.'

   To this purpose I conceive our public admonitions should proceed; and,
   in some cases, where the sinner considereth his sin to be small, it may
   be necessary to point out the aggravations of it, particularly by
   citing some passages of Scripture which speak of its evil and its
   danger.

   (3) With these reproofs and exhortations, we must join the prayers of
   the congregation in behalf of the offender. This should be done in
   every case of discipline, but particularly if the offender will not be
   present to receive admonition, or gives no evidence of repentance, and
   shows no desire for the prayers of the congregation. In such cases,
   especially, it will be meet that we beg the prayers of the congregation
   for him ourselves, entreating them to consider what a fearful condition
   the impenitent are in, and to have pity on a poor soul that is so
   blinded and hardened by sin and Satan, that he cannot pity himself; and
   to think what it is for a man to appear before the living God in such a
   case, and, therefore, that they would join in earnest prayer to God,
   that he would open his eyes, and soften, and humble his stubborn heart,
   before he be in hell beyond remedy. And, accordingly, let us be very
   earnest in prayer for him, that the congregation may be excited
   affectionately to join with us; and who knows but God may hear our
   prayers, and the sinner's heart may relent under them, more than under
   all our exhortations?It is, in my judgment, a very laudable course of
   some churches, that use, for the next three days together, to desire
   the congregation to join in earnest prayer to God for the opening of
   the sinner's eyes, and the softening of his heart, and the saving of
   him from impenitency and eternal death. If ministers would be
   conscientious in performing this duty entirely and self-denyingly, they
   might make something of it, and expect a blessing upon it; but when we
   shrink from all that is dangerous or ungrateful in our work, and shift
   off all that is costly or troublesome, we cannot expect that any great
   good should be effected by such a carnal, partial use of means; and
   though some may here and there be wrought upon, yet we cannot look that
   the gospel should run and be glorified when we do our duty so lamely
   and so defectively.(4) We must restore the penitent to the fellowship
   of the church. As we must not teach an offender to make light of
   discipline by too much facility, so neither must we discourage him by
   too much severity. If he appear to be truly sensible of the sinfulness
   of his conduct, and penitent on account of it, we must see that he
   confess his guilt, and that he promise to fly from such sins for the
   time to come, to watch more narrowly and to walk more warily, to avoid
   temptation, to distrust his own strength, and to rely on the grace
   which is in Christ Jesus.

   We must assure him of the riches of God's love, and the sufficiency of
   Christ's blood to pardon his sins, if he believe and repent.

   We must see that he begs to be restored to the communion of the church,
   and desires their prayers to God for his pardon and salvation.

   We must charge the church that they imitate Christ, in forgiving and in
   retaining the penitent person; or, if he were cast out, in restoring
   him to their communion; and that they must never reproach him with his
   sins, nor cast them in his teeth, but forgive them, even as Christ
   doth. Finally, we must give God thanks for his recovery, and pray for
   his confirmation and future preservation.

   (5) The last part of discipline is the excluding from the communion of
   the church those who, after sufficient trial, remain impenitent.

   Exclusion from church communion, commonly called excommunication, is of
   divers sorts or degrees, which are not to be confounded; but that which
   is most commonly to be practiced amongst us, is, only to remove an
   impenitent sinner from our communion, till it shall please the Lord to
   give him repentance.

   In this exclusion or removal, the minister or governors of the church
   are authoritatively to charge the people, in the name of the Lord, to
   have no communion with him, and to pronounce him one whose communion
   the church is bound to avoid; and it is the people's duty carefully to
   avoid him, provided the pastor's charge contradict not the Word of God.
   Nevertheless, we must pray for the repentance and restoration even of
   the excommunicated; and if God shall give them repentance, we must
   gladly receive them again into the communion of the church.

   Would we were but so far faithful in the practice of this discipline,
   as we are satisfied both of the matter and manner of it; and did not
   dispraise and reproach it by our negligence, while we write and plead
   for it with the highest commendations! It is worthy of our
   consideration, who is like to have the heavier charge about this matter
   at the bar of God - whether those who have reproached and hindered
   discipline by their tongues, because they knew not its nature and
   necessity; or we who have so vilified it by our constant omission,
   while with our tongues we have magnified it? If hypocrisy be no sin, or
   if the knowledge of our Master's will by no aggravation of
   disobedience, then we may be in a better case than they; but if these
   be great evils, we must be much worse than the very persons whom we so
   loudly condemn. I will not advise the zealous maintainers, and
   obstinate neglecters of discipline, to unsay all that they have said,
   till they are ready to do as they say; nor to recant their defences of
   discipline, till they mean to practice it; nor to burn all the books
   which they have written for it, and all the records of their cost and
   hazards for it, lest they rise up in judgment against them, to their
   confusion. But I would persuade them, without any more delay, to
   conform their practice to these testimonies which they have given, lest
   the more they are proved to have commended discipline, the more they
   are proved to have condemned themselves for neglecting it. It hath
   somewhat amazed me to hear some, that I took for reverend, godly
   divines, reproach, as a sect, the Sacramentarians and Disciplinarians.
   And, when I desired to know whom they meant, they told me they meant
   them that will not give the sacrament to all the parish, and them that
   will make distinctions by their discipline. I had thought the tempter
   had obtained a great victory, if he had got but one godly pastor of a
   church to neglect discipline, as well as if he had got him to neglect
   preaching; much more if he had got him to approve of that neglect: but
   it seems that he hath got some to scorn at the performers of the duty
   which they neglect. Sure I am, if it were well understood how much of
   the pastoral authority and work consisteth in church guidance, it would
   be also discerned, that to be against discipline, is near to being
   against the ministry; and to be against the ministry is near to being
   absolutely against the church; and to be against the church, is near to
   being absolutely against Christ. Blame not the harshness of the
   inference, till you can avoid it, and free yourselves from the charge
   of it before the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 2 - THE MANNER OF THIS OVERSIGHT

   Having thus considered the nature of this oversight, we shall next
   speak of the manner; not of each part distinctly, lest we be tedious,
   but of the whole in general.

   1. The ministerial work must be carried on purely for God and the
   salvation of souls, not for any private ends of our own. A wrong end
   makes all the work bad as from us, how good soever it may be in its own
   nature. It is not serving God, but ourselves, if we do it not for God,
   but for ourselves. They who engage in this as a common work, to make a
   trade of it for their worldly livelihood, will find that they have
   chosen a bad trade, though a good employment. Self-denial is of
   absolute necessity in every Christian, but it is doubly necessary in a
   minister, as without it he cannot do God an hour's faithful service.
   Hard studies, much knowledge, and excellent preaching, if the ends be
   not right, is but more glorious hypocritical sinning. The saying of
   Bernard is commonly known: Some desire to know merely for the sake of
   knowing, and that is shameful curiosity. Some desire to know that they
   may sell their knowledge, and that too is shameful. Some desire to know
   for reputation's sake, and that is shameful vanity. But there are some
   who desire to know that they may edify others, and that is
   praiseworthy; and there are some who desire to know that they
   themselves may be edified, and that is wise.'

   2. The ministerial work must be carried on diligently and laboriously,
   as being of such unspeakable consequence to ourselves and others. We
   are seeking to uphold the world, to save it from the curse of God, to
   perfect the creation, to attain the ends of Christ's death, to save
   ourselves and others from damnation, to overcome the devil, and
   demolish his kingdom, to set up the kingdom of Christ, and to attain
   and help others to the kingdom of glory. And are these works to be done
   with a careless mind, or a lazy hand? O see, then, that this work be
   done with all your might! Study hard, for the well is deep, and our
   brains are shallow; and, as Cassiodorus says: Here the common level of
   knowledge is not to be the limit; here a true ambition is demonstrated;
   the more a deep knowledge is sought after, the greater the honor in
   attaining it.' But especially be laborious in the practice and exercise
   of your knowledge. Let Paul's words ring continually in your ears,
   Necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the
   gospel!' Ever think with yourselves what lieth upon your hands: If I do
   not bestir myself, Satan may prevail, and the people everlastingly
   perish, and their blood be required at my hand. By avoiding labor and
   suffering, I shall draw on myself a thousand times more than I avoid;
   whereas, by present diligence, I shall prepare for future blessedness.'
   No man was ever a loser by God.

   3. The ministerial work must be carried on prudently and orderly. Milk
   must go before strong meat; the foundation must be laid before we
   attempt to raise the superstructure. Children must not be dealt with as
   men of full stature. Men must be brought into a state of grace, before
   we can expect from them the works of grace. The work of conversion, and
   repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ, must be first and
   frequently and thoroughly taught. We must not ordinarily go beyond the
   capacities of our people, nor teach them the perfection, that have not
   learned the first principles of religion: for, as Gregory of Nyssa
   saith: We teach not infants the deep precepts of science, but first
   letters, and then syllables, etc. So the guides of the Church do first
   propound to their hearers certain documents, which are as the elements;
   and so by degrees do open to them the more perfect and mysterious
   matters.' Therefore did the Church take so much pains with their
   catechumens, before they baptized them, and would not lay unpolished
   stones into the building.

   4. Throughout the whole course of our ministry, we must insist chiefly
   upon the greatest, most certain, and most necessary truths, and be more
   seldom and sparing upon the rest. If we can but teach Christ to our
   people, we shall teach them all. Get them well to heaven, and they will
   have knowledge enough. The great and commonly acknowledged truths of
   religion are those that men must live upon, and which are the great
   instruments of destroying men's sins, and raising the heart to God. We
   must, therefore, ever have our people's necessities before our eyes. To
   remember the one thing needful' will take us off gauds and needless
   ornaments, and unprofitable controversies. Many other things are
   desirable to be known; but this must be known, or else our people are
   undone for ever. I confess I think NECESSITY should be the great
   disposer of a minister's course of study and labor. If we were
   sufficient for everything, we might attempt everything, and take in
   order the whole Encyclopaedia: but life is short, and we are dull, and
   eternal things are necessary, and the souls that depend on our teaching
   are precious. I confess, necessity hath been the conductor of my
   studies and life. It chooseth what book I shall read, and tells me
   when, and how long. It chooseth my text, and makes my sermon, both for
   matter and manner, so far as I can keep out my own corruption. Though I
   know the constant expectation of death hath been a great cause of this,
   yet I know no reason why the most healthy man should not make sure of
   the most necessary things first, considering the uncertainty and
   shortness of all men's lives. Xenophon thought, there was no better
   teacher than necessity, which teacheth all things most diligently.' Who
   can, in studying, preaching, or laboring, be doing other matters, if he
   do but know that this MUST be done? Who can trifle or delay, that
   feeleth the urgent spurs of necessity? As the soldier saith, No lengthy
   discussing, but speedy and strong contending is needed where necessity
   urges on', so much more must we, as our business is more important.
   Doubtless this is the best way to redeem time, to see that we lose not
   an hour, when we spend it only on necessary things. This is the way to
   be most profitable to others, though not always to be most pleasing and
   applauded; because, through men's frailty, it is true what Seneca says,
   that We are attracted to novelties rather than to great things.'

   Hence it is, that a preacher must be oft upon the same things, because
   the matters of necessity are few. We must not either feign necessaries,
   or fall much upon unnecessaries, to satisfy them that look for
   novelties, though we must clothe the same truths with a grateful
   variety in the manner of our delivery. The great volumes and tedious
   controversies that so much trouble us and waste our time, are usually
   made up more of opinions than of necessary verities; for, as Ficinus
   saith, Necessity is shut up within narrow limits; not so with opinion':
   and, as Gregory Nazianzen and Seneca often say, Necessaries are common
   and obvious; it is superfluities that we waste our time for, and labor
   for, and complain that we attain them not.' Ministers, therefore, must
   be observant of the case of their flocks, that they may know what is
   most necessary for them, both for matter and for manner; and usually
   the matter is to be first regarded, as being of more importance than
   the manner. If you are to choose what authors to read yourselves, will
   you not rather take those that tell you what you know not, and that
   speak the most necessary truths in the clearest manner, though it be in
   barbarous or unhandsome language, than those that will most learnedly
   and elegantly tell you that which is false or vain, and by a great
   effort say nothing.' I purpose to follow Augustine's counsel: Give
   first place to the meaning of the Word, so that the soul is given
   preference over the body; from which it follows that we seek the more
   true as much as the more discerning discourses to be met with, just as
   we seek the more sensible, as much as the more handsome, to be our
   friends.' And surely, as I do in my studies for my own edification, I
   should do in my teaching for other men's. It is commonly empty,
   ignorant men who want the matter and substance of true learning, that
   are over curious and solicitous about words and ornaments, when the
   old, experienced, and most learned men, abound in substantial verities
   delivered usually in the plainest dress. As Aristotle makes it the
   reason why women are more addicted to pride in apparel than men, that,
   being conscious of little inward worth, they seek to make it up with
   outward borrowed ornaments; so is it with empty, worthless preachers,
   who affect to be esteemed that which they are not, and have no other
   way to procure that esteem.

   5. All our teaching must be as plain and simple as possible. This doth
   best suit a teacher's ends. He that would be understood must speak to
   the capacity of his hearers. Truth loves the light, and is most
   beautiful when most naked. It is the sign of an envious enemy to hide
   the truth; and it is the work of a hypocrite to do this under pretense
   of revealing it; and therefore painted obscure sermons (like painted
   glass in windows which keeps out the light) are too oft the marks of
   painted hypocrites. If you would not teach men, what do you in the
   pulpit? If you would, why do you not speak so as to be understood? I
   know the height of the matter may make a man not understood, when he
   hath studied to make it as plain as he can; but that a man should
   purposely cloud the matter in strange words, and hide his mind from the
   people, whom he pretendeth to instruct, is the way to make fools admire
   his profound learning, and wise men his folly, pride, and hypocrisy.
   Some men conceal their sentiments, under the pretense of necessity,
   because of men's prejudices, and the unpreparedness of common
   understandings to receive the truth. But truth overcomes prejudice by
   the mere light of evidence, and there is no better way to make a good
   cause prevail, than to make it as plain, and as generally and
   thoroughly known as we can; it is this light that will dispose an
   unprepared mind. It is, at best, a sign that a man hath not well
   digested the matter himself, if he is not able to deliver it plainly to
   others. I mean as plainly as the nature of the matter will bear, in
   regard of capacities prepared for it by prerequisite truths; for I know
   that some men cannot at present understand some truths, if you speak
   them as plainly as words can express them; as the easiest rules in
   grammar, most plainly taught, will not be understood by a child that is
   but learning his alphabet.

   6. Our work must be carried on with great humility. We must carry
   ourselves meekly and condescendingly to all; and so teach others, as to
   be as ready to learn of any that can teach us, and so both teach and
   learn at once; not proudly venting our own conceits, and disdaining all
   that any way contradict them, as if we had attained to the height of
   knowledge, and were destined for the chair, and other men to sit at our
   feet. Pride is a vice that ill beseems them that must lead men in such
   an humble way to heaven: let us, therefore, take heed, lest, when we
   have brought others thither, the gate should prove too strait for
   ourselves. For, as Grotius saith, Pride is born in heaven, but as if
   unmindful that the way from that place is closed, it is impossible for
   it to return afterwards!' God, that thrust out a proud angel, will not
   entertain there a proud preacher. Methinks we should remember, at least
   the title of a Minister, which, though the popish priests disdain, yet
   so do not we. It is this pride at the root that feedeth all the rest of
   our sins. Hence the envy, the contention, and unpeaceableness of
   ministers; hence the stops to all reformation; all would lead, and few
   will follow or concur. Hence, also, is the non-proficiency of too many
   ministers, because they are too proud to learn. Humility would teach
   them another lesson. I may say of ministers as Augustine to Jerome,
   even of the aged among them, Although it is more fitting for the aged
   to teach than to learn, much more is it fitting to learn than to be
   ignorant.'

   7. There must be a prudent mixture of severity and mildness both in our
   preaching and discipline; each must be predominant, according to the
   quality or character of the person, or matter, that we have in hand. If
   there be no severity, our reproofs will be despised. If all severity,
   we shall be taken as usurpers of dominion, rather than persuaders of
   the minds of men to the truth.

   8. We must be serious, earnest, and zealous in every part of our work.
   Our work requireth greater skill, and especially greater life and zeal
   than any of us bring to it. It is no small matter to stand up in the
   face of a congregation, and to deliver a message of salvation or
   damnation, as from the living God, in the name of the Redeemer. It is
   no easy matter to speak so plainly, that the most ignorant may
   understand us; and so seriously that the deadest hearts may feel us;
   and so convincingly, that the contradicting cavillers may be silenced.
   The weight of our matter condemneth coldness and sleepy dullness. We
   should see that we be well awakened ourselves, and our spirits in such
   a plight as may make us fit to awaken others. If our words be not
   sharpened, and pierce not as nails, they will hardly be felt by stony
   hearts. To speak slightly and coldly of heavenly things is nearly as
   bad as to say nothing of them at all.

   9. The whole of our ministry must be carried on in tender love to our
   people. We must let them see that nothing pleaseth us but what
   profiteth them; and that what doeth them good doth us good; and that
   nothing troubleth us more than their hurt. We must feel toward our
   people, as a father toward his children: yea, the tenderest love of a
   mother must not surpass ours. We must even travail in birth, till
   Christ be formed in them. They should see that we care for no outward
   thing, neither wealth, nor liberty, nor honor, nor life, in comparison
   of their salvation; but could even be content, with Moses, to have our
   names blotted out of the book of life, i. e. to be removed from the
   number of the living: rather than they should not be found in the
   Lamb's book of life. Thus should we, as John saith, be ready to lay
   down our lives for the brethren,' and, with Paul, not count our lives
   dear to us, so we may but finish our course with joy, and the ministry
   which we have received of the Lord Jesus.' When the people see that you
   unfeignedly love them, they will hear any thing and bear any thing from
   you; as Augustine saith, Love God, and do what you please.' We
   ourselves will take all things well from one that we know doth entirely
   love us. We will put up with a blow that is given us in love, sooner
   than with a foul word that is spoken to us in malice or in anger. Most
   men judge of the counsel, as they judge of the a affection of him that
   gives it: at least, so far as to give it a fair hearing. Oh, therefore,
   see that you feel a tender love to your people in your breasts, and let
   them perceive it in your speeches, and see it in your conduct. Let them
   see that you spend, and are spent, for their sakes; and that all you do
   is for them, and not for any private ends of your own. To this end the
   works of charity are necessary, as far as your estate will reach; for
   bare words will hardly convince men that you have any great love to
   them. But, if you are not able to give, show that you are willing to
   give if you had it, and do that sort of good you can. But see that your
   love be not carnal, flowing from pride, as one that is a suitor for
   himself rather than for Christ, and, therefore, doth love because he is
   loved, or that he may be loved. Take heed, therefore, that you do not
   connive at the sins of your people, under pretense of love, for that
   were to cross the nature and end of love. Friendship must be cemented
   by piety. A wicked man cannot be a true friend; and, if you befriend
   their wickedness, you show that you are wicked yourselves. Pretend not
   to love them, if you favor their sins, and seek not their salvation. By
   favoring their sins, you will show your enmity to God; and then how can
   you love your brother? If you be their best friends, help them against
   their worst enemies. And think not all sharpness inconsistent with
   love: parents correct their children, and God himself chastens every
   son whom he receiveth.' Augustine saith, Better it is to love even with
   the accompaniment of severity, than to mislead by (excess of) lenity.'

   10. We must carry on our work with patience. We must bear with many
   abuses and injuries from those to whom we seek to do good. When we have
   studied for them, and prayed for them, and exhorted them, and beseeched
   them with all earnestness and condescension, and given them what we are
   able, and tended them as if they had been our children, we must look
   that many of them will requite us with scorn and hatred and contempt,
   and account us their enemies, because we tell them the truth.' Now, we
   must endure all this patiently, and we must unweariedly hold on in
   doing good, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if
   God, peradventure, will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
   the truth.' We have to deal with distracted men who will fly in the
   face of their physician, but we must not, therefore, neglect their
   cure. He is unworthy to be a physician, who will be driven away from a
   frenetic patient by foul words. Yet, alas, when sinners reproach and
   slander us for our love, and are more ready to spit in our faces, than
   to thank us for our advice, what heart-risings will there be, and how
   will the remnants of old Adam (pride and passion) struggle against the
   meekness and patience of the new man! And how sadly do many ministers
   come off under such trials!

   11. All our work must be managed reverently, as beseemeth them that
   believe the presence of God, and use not holy things as if they were
   common. Reverence is that affection of the soul which proceedeth from
   deep apprehensions of God and indicateth a mind that is much conversant
   with him. To manifest irreverence in the things of God is to manifest
   hypocrisy, and that the heart agreeth not with the tongue. I know not
   how it is with others, but the most reverent preacher, that speaks as
   if he saw the face of God, doth more affect my heart, though with
   common words, than an irreverent man with the most exquisite
   preparations. Yea, though he bawl it out with never so much seeming
   earnestness, if reverence be not answerable to fervency, it worketh but
   little. Of all preaching in the world, (that speaks not stark lies) I
   hate that preaching which tends to make the hearers laugh, or to move
   their minds with tickling levity, and affect them as stage-plays used
   to do, instead of affecting them with a holy reverence of the name of
   God. Jerome says, Teach in thy church, not to get the applause of the
   people, but to set in motion the groan; the tears of the hearers are
   thy praises.' The more of God appeareth in our duties, the more
   authority will they have with men. We should, as it were, suppose we
   saw the throne of God, and the millions of glorious angels attending
   him, that we may be awed with his majesty when we draw near him in holy
   things, lest we profane them and take his name in vain.

   12. All our work must be done spiritually, as by men possessed of the
   Holy Ghost. There is in some men's preaching a spiritual strain, which
   spiritual hearers can discern and relish; whereas, in other men's, this
   sacred tincture is so wanting, that, even when they speak of spiritual
   things, the manner is such as if they were common matters. Our evidence
   and illustrations of divine truth must also be spiritual, being drawn
   from the Holy Scriptures, rather than from the writings of men. The
   wisdom of the world must not be magnified against the wisdom of God;
   philosophy must be taught to stoop and serve, while faith doth bear the
   chief sway. Great scholars in Aristotle's school must take heed of
   glorying too much in their master, and despising those that are below
   them, lest they themselves prove lower in the school of Christ, and
   least in the kingdom of God,' while they would be great in the eyes of
   men. As wise a man as any of them would glory in nothing but the cross
   of Christ, and determined to know nothing but him crucified. They that
   are so confident that Aristotle is in hell, should not too much take
   him for their guide in the way to heaven. It is an excellent memorandum
   that Gregory hath left: God in the first place gathers together the
   unlearned; afterwards the wise ones. And not of orators does he make
   fishermen, but of fishermen he produces orators.' The most learned men
   should think of this.

   Let all writers have their due esteem, but compare none of them with
   the Word of God. We will not refuse their service, but we must abhor
   them as rivals or competitors. It is the sign of a distempered heart
   that loseth the relish of Scripture excellency. For there is in a
   spiritual heart a co-naturality to the Word of God, because this is the
   seed which did regenerate him. The Word is that seal which made all the
   holy impressions that are in the hearts of true believers, and stamped
   the image of God upon them; and, therefore, they must needs be like
   that Word and highly esteem it as long as they live.

   13. If you would prosper in your work, be sure to keep up earnest
   desires and expectations of success. If your hearts be not set on the
   end of your labors, and you long not to see the conversion and
   edification of your hearers, and do not study and preach in hope, you
   are not likely to see much success. As it is a sign of a false,
   self-seeking heart, that can be content to be still doing, and yet see
   no fruit of his labor; so I have observed that God seldom blesseth any
   man's work so much as his, whose heart is set upon the success of it.
   Let it be the property of a Judas to have more regard to the bag than
   to his work, and not to care much for what they pretend to care; and to
   think, if they have their salaries, and the love and commendations of
   their people, they have enough to satisfy them: but, let all who preach
   for Christ and men's salvation, be unsatisfied till they have the thing
   they preach for. He never had the right ends of a preacher, who is
   indifferent whether he obtain them, and is not grieved when he misseth
   them, and rejoiced when he can see the desired issue. When a man doth
   only study what to say, and how, with commendation, to spend the hour,
   and looks no more after it, unless it be to know what people think of
   his abilities, and thus holds on from year to year, I must needs think
   that this man doth preach for himself, and not for Christ, even when he
   preacheth Christ, how excellently soever he may seem to do it. No wise
   or charitable physician is content to be always giving physic, and to
   see no amendment among his patients, but to have them all die upon his
   hands: nor will any wise and honest schoolmaster be content to be still
   teaching, though his scholars profit not by his instructions; but both
   of them would rather be weary of the employment.

   I know that a faithful minister may have comfort when he wants success;
   and though Israel be not gathered, our reward is with the Lord," and
   our acceptance is not according to the fruit, but according to our
   labor: but then, he that longeth not for the success of his labors can
   have none of this comfort, because he was not a faithful laborer. What
   I say is only for them that are set upon the end, and grieved if they
   miss it. Nor is this the full comfort that we must desire, but only
   such a part as may quiet us, though we miss the rest. What if God will
   accept a physician, though the patient die? He must, notwithstanding
   that, work in compassion, and long for a better issue, and be sorry if
   he miss it. For it is not merely our own reward that we labor for, but
   other men's salvation. I confess, for my part, I marvel at some ancient
   reverend men, that have lived twenty, thirty, or forty years with an
   unprofitable people, among whom they have scarcely been able to discern
   any fruits of their labors, how they can, with so much patience,
   continue among them. Were it my case, though I durst not leave the
   vineyard, nor quit my calling, yet I should suspect that it was God's
   will I should go somewhere else, and another come in my place that
   might be fitter for them; and I should not be easily satisfied to spend
   my days in such a manner.

   14. Our whole work must be carried on under a deep sense of our own
   insufficiency, and of our entire dependence on Christ. We must go for
   light, and life, and strength to him who sends us on the work. And when
   we feel our own faith weak, and our hearts dull, and unsuitable to so
   great a work as we have to do, we must have recourse to him, and say,
   Lord, wilt thou send me with such an unbelieving heart to persuade
   others to believe? Must I daily plead with sinners about everlasting
   life and everlasting death, and have no more belief or feeling of these
   weighty things myself? O, send me not naked and unprovided to the work;
   but, as thou commandest me to do it, furnish me with a spirit suitable
   thereto.' Prayer must carry on our work as well as preaching: he
   preacheth not heartily to his people, that prayeth not earnestly for
   them. If we prevail not with God to give them faith and repentance, we
   shall never prevail with them to believe and repent. When our own
   hearts are so far out of order, and theirs so far out of order, if we
   prevail not with God to mend and help them, we are like to make but
   unsuccessful work.

   15. Having given you these concomitants of our ministerial work, as
   singly to be performed by every minister, let me conclude with one
   other, that is necessary to us as we are fellow-laborers in the same
   work; and that is this, we must be very studious of union and communion
   among ourselves, and of the unity and peace of the churches that we
   oversee. We must be sensible how needful this is to the prosperity of
   the whole, the strengthening of our common cause, the good of the
   particular members of our flock, and the further enlargement of the
   kingdom of Christ. And, therefore, ministers must smart when the Church
   is wounded, and be so far from being the leaders in divisions, that
   they should take it as a principal part of their work to prevent and
   heal them. Day and night should they bend their studies to find out
   means to close such breaches. They must not only hearken to motions for
   unity, but propound them and prosecute them; not only entertain an
   offered peace, but even follow it when it flieth from them. They must,
   therefore, keep dose to the ancient simplicity of the Christian faith,
   and the foundation and center of catholic unity. They must abhor the
   arrogancy of them that frame new engines to rack and tear the Church of
   Christ under pretense of obviating errors and maintaining the truth.
   The Scripture sufficiency must be maintained, and nothing beyond it
   imposed on others; and if papists, or others, call to us for the
   standard and rule of our religion, it is the Bible that we must show
   them, rather than any confessions of churches, or writings of men. We
   must learn to distinguish between certainties and uncertainties,
   necessaries and unnecessaries, catholic verities and private opinions;
   and to lay the stress of the Church's peace upon the former, not upon
   the latter. We must avoid the common confusion of speaking of those who
   make no difference between verbal and real errors, and hate that
   madness formerly among theologians,' who tear their brethren as
   heretics, before they understand them. And we must learn to see the
   true state of controversies, and reduce them to the very point where
   the difference lieth, and not make them seem greater than they are.
   Instead of quarrelling with our brethren, we must combine against the
   common adversaries; and all ministers must associate and hold
   communion, and correspondence, and constant meetings to these ends; and
   smaller differences of judgment are not to interrupt them. They must do
   as much of the work of God, in unity and concord, as they can, which is
   the use of synods; not to rule over one another, and make laws, but to
   avoid misunderstandings, and consult for mutual edification, and
   maintain love and communion, and go on unanimously in the work that God
   hath already commanded us. Had the ministers of the gospel been men of
   peace, and of catholic, rather than factious spirits, the Church of
   Christ had not been in the case it now is. The nations of Lutherans and
   Calvinists abroad, and the differing parties here at home, would not
   have been plotting the subversion of one another, nor remain at that
   distance, and in that uncharitable bitterness, nor strengthen the
   common enemy, and hinder the building and prosperity of the Church as
   they have done.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 3 -- MOTIVES TO THE OVERSIGHT OF THE FLOCK

   Having considered the manner in which we are to take heed to the flock,
   I shall now proceed to lay before you some motives to this oversight;
   and here I shall confine myself to those contained in my text.

   1. The first consideration which the text suggesteth to us, is drawn
   from our relation to the flock: We are overseers of it.

   (1) The nature of our office requireth us to take heed to the flock.'
   What else are we overseers for "Bishop" is a title which intimates more
   of 'labor than of honor,' says Polydore Virgil. To be a bishop, or
   pastor, is not to be set up as an idol for the people to bow to, or as
   idle slow bellies,' to live to our fleshly delight and ease; but it is
   to be the guide of sinners to heaven. It is a sad case that men should
   be of a calling of which they know not the nature, and undertake they
   know not what. Do these men consider what they have undertaken, that
   live in ease and pleasure, and have time to take their superfluous
   recreations and to spend an hour and more at once, in loitering, or in
   vain discourse, when so much work doth lie upon their hands? Brethren,
   do you consider what you have taken upon you? Why, you have undertaken
   the conduct, under Christ, of a band of his soldiers against
   principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places.'
   You must lead them on to the sharpest conflicts; you must acquaint them
   with the enemies' stratagems and assaults; you must watch yourselves,
   and keep them watching. If you miscarry, they and you may perish. You
   have a subtle enemy, and therefore you must be wise. You have a
   vigilant enemy, and therefore you must be vigilant. You have a
   malicious and violent and unwearied enemy, and therefore you must be
   resolute, courageous and indefatigable. You are in a crowd of enemies,
   encompassed by them on every side, and if you heed one and not all, you
   will quickly fall. And oh, what a world of work have you to do! Had you
   but one ignorant old man or woman to teach, what a hard task would it
   be, even though they should be willing to learn! But if they be as
   unwilling as they are ignorant, how much more difficult will it prove!
   But to have such a multitude of ignorant persons, as most of us have,
   what work will it find us! What a pitiful life is it to have to reason
   with men that have almost lost the use of reason, and to argue with
   them that neither understand themselves nor you! O brethren, what a
   world of wickedness have we to contend against in one soul; and what a
   number of these worlds! And when you think you have done something, you
   leave the seed among the fowls of the air; wicked men are at their
   elbows to rise up and contradict all you have said. You speak but once
   to a sinner, for ten or twenty times that the emissaries of Satan speak
   to them.

   Moreover, how easily do the business and cares of the world choke the
   seed which you have sown. And if the truth had no enemy but what is in
   themselves, how easily will a frozen carnal heart extinguish those
   sparks which you have been long in kindling! yea, for want of fuel, and
   further help, they will go out of themselves. And when you think your
   work doth happily succeed, and have seen men confessing their sins, and
   promising reformation, and living as new creatures and zealous
   converts, alas! they may, after all this, prove unsound and false at
   the heart, and such as were but superficially changed and took up new
   opinions and new company, without a new heart. O how many, after some
   considerable change, are deceived by the profits and honors of the
   world, and are again entangled by their former lusts! How many do but
   change a disgraceful way of flesh-pleasing, for a way that is less
   dishonorable, and maketh not so great a noise in their consciences! How
   many grow proud before they acquire a thorough knowledge of religion;
   and, confident in the strength of their unfurnished intellects,
   greedily snatch at every error that is presented to them under the name
   of truth; and, like chickens that straggle from the hen, are carried
   away by that infernal kite, while they proudly despise the guidance and
   advice of those that Christ hath set over them for their safety! O
   brethren, what a field of work is there before us! Not a person that
   you see but may find you work. In the saints themselves, how soon do
   the Christian graces languish if you neglect them; and how easily are
   they drawn into sinful ways, to the dishonor of the gospel, and to
   their own loss and sorrow! If this be the work of a minister, you may
   see what a life he hath to lead. Let us, then, be up and doing, with
   all our might; difficulties must quicken, not discourage us in so
   necessary a work. If we cannot do all, let us do what we can; for, if
   we neglect it, woe to us, and to the souls committed to our care!
   Should we pass over all these other duties, and, by a plausible sermon
   only, think to prove ourselves faithful ministers, and to put off God
   and man with such a shell and vizor, our reward will prove as
   superficial as our work.

   (2) Consider that it is by your own voluntary undertaking and
   engagement that all this work is laid upon you. No man forced you to be
   overseers of the Church. And doth not common honesty bind you to be
   true to your trust?

   (3) Consider that you have the honor to encourage you to the labor. And
   a great honor it is to be the ambassadors of God, and the instruments
   of men's conversion, to save their souls from death, and to cover a
   multitude of sins.' The honor, indeed, is but the attendant of the
   work. To do, therefore, as the prelates of the Church in all ages have
   done, to strive for precedency, and fill the world with contentions
   about the dignity and superiority of their seats, doth show that we
   much forget the nature of that office which we have undertaken. I
   seldom see ministers strive so furiously, who shall go first to a poor
   man's cottage to teach him and his family the way to heaven; or who
   shall first endeavor the conversion of a sinner, or first become the
   servant of all. Strange, that notwithstanding all the plain expressions
   of Christ, men will not understand the nature of their office! If they
   did, would they strive who would be the pastor of a whole county and
   more, when there are so many thousand poor sinners in it that cry for
   help, and they are neither able nor willing to engage for their relief?
   Nay, when they can patiently live in the house with profane persons,
   and not follow them seriously and incessantly for their conversion? And
   that they would have the name and honor of the work of a county, who
   are unable to do all the work of a parish, when the honor is but the
   appendage of the work. Is it names and honor, or the work and end, that
   they desire? Oh! if they would faithfully, humbly, and self-denyingly
   lay out themselves for Christ and his Church, and never think of titles
   and reputation, they should then have honor whether they would or not;
   but by gaping after it, they lose it: for, this is the case of virtue's
   shadow, What follows I fly; what flies, the same I follow.'

   (4) Consider that you have many other excellent privileges of the
   ministerial office to encourage you to the work. If therefore you will
   not do the work, you have nothing to do with the privileges. It is
   something that you are maintained by other men's labors. This is for
   your work, that you may not be taken off from it, but, as Paul
   requireth, may give yourselves wholly to these things,' and not be
   forced to neglect men's souls, whilst you are providing for your own
   bodies. Either do the work, then, or take not the maintenance. But you
   have far greater privileges than this. Is it nothing to be brought up
   to learning, when others are brought up to the cart and plough? and to
   be furnished with so much delightful knowledge, when the world lieth in
   ignorance? Is it nothing to converse with learned men, and to talk of
   high and glorious things, when others must converse with almost none
   but the most vulgar and illiterate? But especially, what an excellent
   privilege is it, to live in studying and preaching Christ! to be
   continually searching into his mysteries, or feeding on them! to be
   daily employed in the consideration of he blessed nature, works, and
   ways of God! Others are glad of the leisure of the Lord's day, and now
   and then of an hour besides, when they can lay hold upon it. But we may
   keep a continual Sabbath. We may do almost nothing else, but study and
   talk of God and glory, and engage in acts of prayer and praise, and
   drink in his sacred, saving truths. Our employment is all high and
   spiritual. Whether we be alone, or in company, our business is for
   another world. O that our hearts were but more tuned to this work! What
   a blessed, joyful life should we then live! How sweet would our study
   be to us! How pleasant the pulpit! And what delight would our
   conference about spiritual and eternal things afford us! To live among
   such excellent helps as our libraries afford, to have so many silent
   wise companions whenever we please - all these, and many other similar
   privileges of the ministry, bespeak our unwearied diligence in the
   work.

   (5) By your work you are related to Christ, as well as to the flock.
   You are the stewards of his mysteries, and rulers of his household; and
   he that entrusted you, will maintain you in his work. But then, it is
   required of a steward that a man be found faithful.' Be true to him,
   and never doubt but he will be true to you. Do you feed his flock, and
   he will sooner feed you as he did Elijah, than leave you to want. If
   you be in prison, he will open the doors; but then you must relieve
   imprisoned souls. He will give you "a tongue and wisdom that no enemy
   shall be able to resist," but then you must use it faithfully for him.
   If you will put forth your hand to relieve the distressed, he will
   wither the hand that is stretched out against you. The ministers of
   England, I am sure, may know this by large experience. Many a time hath
   God rescued them from the jaws of the devourer. Oh, the admirable
   preservations and deliverances that they have had from cruel Papists,
   from tyrannical persecutors, and from misguided, passionate men!
   Consider, brethren, why it is that God hath done all this. Is it for
   your persons, or for his Church? What are you to him more than other
   men, but for his work and people's sakes? Are you angels? Is your flesh
   formed of better clay than your neighbors? Are you not of the same
   generation of sinners, that need his grace as much as they? Up then,
   and work as the redeemed of the Lord, as those that are purposely
   rescued from ruin for his service. If you believe that God hath rescued
   you for himself, live to him, as being unreservedly his who hath
   delivered you.

   2. The second motive in the text is drawn from the efficient cause of
   this relation. It is the Holy Ghost that hath made us overseers of his
   Church, and, therefore, it behoveth us to take heed to it. The Holy
   Ghost makes men bishops or overseers of the Church in three several
   respects: By qualifying them for the office; by directing the ordainers
   to discern their qualifications, and know the fittest men; and by
   directing them, the people and themselves, for the affixing them to a
   particular charge. All these things were then done in an extraordinary
   way, by inspiration, or at least very often. The same are done now by
   the ordinary way of the Spirit's assistance. But it is the same Spirit
   still; and men are made overseers of the Church (when they are rightly
   called) by the Holy Ghost, now as well as then. It is a strange
   conceit, therefore, of the Papists, that ordination by the hands of man
   is of more absolute necessity in the ministerial office, than the
   calling of the Holy Ghost. God hath determined in his Word, that there
   shall be such an office, and what the work and power of that office
   shall be, and what sort of men, as to their qualifications, shall
   receive it. None of these can be undone by man, or made unnecessary.
   God also giveth men the qualifications which he requireth; so that, all
   that the Church hath to do, whether pastors or people, ordainers or
   electors, is but to discern and determine which are the men that God
   hath thus qualified, and to accept of them that are so provided, and,
   upon consent, to install them solemnly in this office. What an
   obligation, then, is laid upon us, by our call to the work! If our
   commission be sent from heaven, it is not to be disobeyed. When the
   apostles were called by Christ from their secular employments, they
   immediately left friends, and house, and trade, and all, and followed
   him. When Paul was called by the voice of Christ, he was not
   disobedient to the heavenly vision.' Though our call is not so
   immediate or extraordinary, yet it is from the same Spirit. It is no
   safe course to imitate Jonah, in turning our back upon the commands of
   God. If we neglect our work, he hath a spur to quicken us; if we run
   away from it, he hath messengers enough to overtake us, and bring us
   back, and make us do it; and it is better to do it at first than at
   last.

   3. The third motive in the text is drawn from the dignity of the object
   which is committed to our charge. It is the Church of God which we must
   oversee - that Church for which the world is chiefly upheld, which is
   sanctified by the Holy Ghost, which is the mystical body of Christ,
   that Church with which angels are present, and on which they attend as
   ministering spirits, whose little ones have their angels beholding the
   face of God in heaven. Oh what a charge is it that we have undertaken!
   And shall we be unfaithful to it? Have we the stewardship of God's own
   family, and shall we neglect it? Have we the conduct of those saints
   that shall live for ever with God in glory, and shall we neglect them?
   God forbid! I beseech you, brethren, let this thought awaken the
   negligent. You that draw back from painful, displeasing, suffering
   duties, and put off men's souls with ineffectual formalities, do you
   think this is honorable treatment of Christ's spouse? Are the souls of
   men thought meet by God to see his face, and live for ever in heaven,
   and are they not worthy of your utmost cost and labor on earth? Do you
   think so basely of the Church of God, as if it deserved not the best of
   your care and help? Were you the keepers of sheep or swine, you would
   scarcely let them go, and say, They are not worth the looking after;
   especially if they were your own. And dare you say so of the souls of
   men, of the Church of God? Christ walketh among them: remember his
   presence, and see that you are diligent in your work. They are a chosen
   generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, to
   show forth the praises of him that hath called them.' And yet will you
   neglect them? What a high honor is it to be but one of them, yea, but a
   door-keeper in the house of God'! But to be the priest of these
   priests, and the ruler of these kings - this is such an honor as
   multiplieth your obligations to diligence and fidelity in so noble an
   employment.

   4. The last motive that is mentioned in my text, is drawn from the
   price that was paid for the Church which we oversee: Which God,' says
   the apostle, hath purchased with his own blood.' Oh what an argument is
   this to quicken the negligent, and to condemn those who will not be
   quickened to their duty by it! Oh,' saith one of the ancient doctors,
   If Christ had but committed to my keeping one spoonful of his blood in
   a fragile glass, how curiously would I preserve it, and how tender
   would I be of that glass! If then he have committed to me the purchase
   of his blood, should I not as carefully look to my charge? What! sirs,
   shall we despise the blood of Christ? Shall we think it was shed for
   them who are not worthy of our utmost care? You may see here, it is not
   a little fault that negligent pastors are guilty of. As much as in them
   lieth, the blood of Christ would be shed in vain. They would lose him
   those souls which he hath so dearly purchased. Oh, then, let us hear
   these arguments of Christ, whenever we feel ourselves grow dull and
   careless: Did I die for these souls, and wilt not thou look after them?
   Were they worth my blood, and are they not worth thy labor? Did I come
   down from heaven to earth, "to seek and to save that which was lost;"
   and wilt thou not go to the next door, or street, or village, to seek
   them? How small is thy condescension and labor compared to mine! I
   debased myself to this, but it is thy honor to be so employed. Have I
   done and suffered so much for their salvation, and was I willing to
   make thee a fellow-worker with me, and wilt thou refuse to do that
   little which lieth upon thy hands?' Every time we look upon our
   congregations, let us believingly remember that they are the purchase
   of Christ's blood, and therefore should be regarded by us with the
   deepest interest and the most tender affection. Oh, think what a
   confusion it will be to a negligent minister, at the last day, to have
   this blood of the Son of God pleaded against him; and for Christ to
   say, It was the purchase of my blood of which thou didst make so light,
   and dost thou think to be saved by it thyself?' O brethren, seeing
   Christ will bring his blood to plead with us, let it plead us to our
   duty, lest it plead us to damnation.

   I have now done with the motives which I find in the text itself. There
   are many more that might be gathered from the rest of this exhortation
   of the apostle, but we must not stay to take in all. If the Lord set
   home but these few upon our hearts, I doubt not we shall see reason to
   mend our pace; and the change will be such on our hearts and in our
   ministry, that ourselves and our congregations will have cause to bless
   God for it. I know myself to be unworthy to be your monitor; but a
   monitor you must have; and it is better for us to hear of our sin and
   duty from anybody than from nobody. Receive the admonition, and you
   will see no cause in the monitor's unworthiness to repent of it. But if
   you reject it, the unworthiest messenger may bear that witness against
   you another day which will then confound you.

CHAPTER 3

APPLICATION
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION 1 - THE USE OF HUMILIATION

   Reverend and dear brethren, our business here this day is to humble our
   souls before the Lord for our past negligence, and to implore God's
   assistance in our work for the time to come. Indeed, we can scarcely
   expect the latter without the former. If God will help us in our future
   duty, he will first humble us for our past sin. He that hath not so
   much sense of his faults as unfeignedly to lament them, will hardly
   have so much more as to move him to reform them. The sorrow of
   repentance may exist without a change of heart and life; because a
   passion may be more easily wrought, than a true conversion. But the
   change cannot take place without some good measure of the sorrow.
   Indeed, we may here justly begin our confessions; it is too common with
   us to expect that from our people, which we do little or nothing in
   ourselves. What pains do we take to humble them, while we ourselves are
   unhumbled! How hard do we expostulate with them to wring out of them a
   few penitential tears, (and all too little) while yet our own eyes are
   dry! Alas! how we set them an example of hard-heartedness, while we are
   endeavoring by our words to melt and mollify them! Oh, if we did but
   study half as much to affect and amend our own hearts, as we do those
   of our hearers, it would not be with many of us as it is! It is a great
   deal too little that we do for their humiliation; but I fear it is much
   less that some of us do for our own, Too many do somewhat for other
   men's souls, while they seem to forget that they have souls of their
   own to regard. They so carry the matter, as if their part of the work
   lay in calling for repentance, and the hearers' in repenting; theirs in
   bespeaking tears and sorrow, and other men's in weeping and sorrowing;
   theirs in crying down sin, and the people's in forsaking it; theirs in
   preaching duty, and the hearers' in practising it.

   But we find that the guides of the Church in Scripture did confess
   their own sins, as well as the sins of the people. Ezra confessed the
   sins of the priests, as well as of the people, weeping and casting
   himself down before the house of God. Daniel confessed his own sin, as
   well as the people's. I think, if we consider well the duties already
   stated, and how imperfectly we have performed them, we need not demur
   upon the question, whether we have cause of humiliation? I must needs
   say, though I condemn myself in saying it, that he who readeth but this
   one exhortation of Paul to the elders of the church at Ephesus, and
   compareth his life with it, must be stupid and hard-hearted, if he do
   not melt under a sense of his neglects, and be not laid in the dust
   before God and forced to bewail his great omissions, and to fly for
   refuge to the blood of Christ, and to his pardoning grace. I am
   confident, brethren, that none of you do in judgment approve of the
   libertine doctrine, that crieth down the necessity of confession,
   contrition, and humiliation, yea, and in order to the pardon of sin! Is
   it not a pity, then, that our hearts are not as orthodox as our heads?
   But I see we have but half learned our lesson, when we know it, and can
   say it. When the understanding hath learned it, there is more ado to
   teach our wills and affections, our eyes, our tongues, and hands. It is
   a sad thing that so many of us preach our hearers asleep; but it is
   sadder still, if we have studied and preached ourselves asleep, and
   have talked so long against hardness of heart, till our own has grown
   hardened under the noise of our own reproofs. And that you may see that
   it is not a causeless sorrow that God requireth of us, I shall call to
   your remembrance our manifold sins, and set them in order before you,
   that we may deal plainly and faithfully in a free confession of them,
   and that God who is faithful and just may forgive them, and cleanse us
   from all iniquity.' In this I suppose I have your hearty consent, and
   that you will be so far from being offended with me, though I should
   disgrace your persons, and others in this office, that you will readily
   subscribe the charge, and be humble self-accusers; and so far am I from
   justifying myself by the accusation of others, that I do unfeignedly
   put my name with the first in the bill of indictment. For how can a
   wretched sinner, one chargeable with so many and so great
   transgressions, presume to justify himself before God? Or how can he
   plead guiltless, whose conscience hath so much to say against him? If I
   cast shame upon the ministry, it is not on the office, but on our
   persons, by opening that sin which is our shame. The glory of our high
   employment doth not communicate any glory to our sin; for sin is a
   reproach to any people.' And be they pastors or people, it is only they
   that confess and forsake their sins that shall have mercy,' while he
   that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.'

   The great sins that we are guilty of, I shall not undertake to
   enumerate; and therefore my passing over any particular one, is not to
   be taken as a denial or justification of it. But I shall consider it as
   my duty, to instance some few which cry loud for humiliation and speedy
   reformation.

   Only I must needs first premise this profession, that, notwithstanding
   all the faults which are now amongst us, I do not believe that ever
   England had so able and faithful a ministry since it was a nation, as
   it hath at this day; and I fear that few nations on earth, if any, have
   the like. Sure I am, the change is so great within these twelve years,
   that it is one of the greatest joys that ever I had in the world to
   behold it. Oh, how many congregations are now plainly and frequently
   taught, that lived then in great obscurity! How many able, faithful men
   are there now in a county, in comparison of what were then! How
   graciously hath God prospered the studies of many young men, who were
   little children in the beginning of the late troubles, so that now they
   cloud the most of their seniors! How many miles would I have gone
   twenty years ago, and less, to have heard one of those ancient reverend
   divines, whose congregations are now grown thin, and their parts
   esteemed mean, by reason of the notable improvement of their juniors!
   And in particular, how mercifully hath the Lord dealt with this poor
   county of Worcester, in raising up so many who do credit to the sacred
   office, and self-denyingly and freely, zealously and unweariedly, lay
   out themselves for the good of souls! I bless the Lord that hath placed
   me in such a neighborhood, where I may have the brotherly fellowship of
   so many able, faithful, humble, unanimous, and peaceable men. Oh that
   the Lord would long continue this admirable mercy to this unworthy
   county! And I hope I shall rejoice in God while I have a being, for the
   common change in other parts, that I have lived to see: that so many
   hundred faithful men are so hard at work for the saving of souls,
   although with the muttering and gnashing of teeth of the enemy; and
   that more are springing up apace. I know there are some men, whose
   parts I reverence, who being, in point of government, of another mind
   from them, will be offended at my very mention of this happy
   alteration: but I must profess, if I were absolutely prelatical, if I
   knew my heart, I could not choose for all that but rejoice. What! not
   rejoice at the prosperity of the Church, because the men do differ in
   one opinion about its order. Should I shut my eyes against the mercies
   of the Lord? The souls of men are not so contemptible to me, that I
   should envy them the bread of life, because it is broken to them by a
   hand that had not the prelatical approbation. O that every congregation
   were thus supplied! But every thing cannot be done at once. They had a
   long time to settle a corrupted ministry; and when the ignorant and
   scandalous are cast out, we cannot create abilities in others for the
   supply; we must stay the time of their preparation and growth; and
   then, if England drive not away the gospel by their abuse, even by
   their wilful unreformedness, and hatred of the light, they are like to
   be the happiest nation under heaven. For, as for all the sects and
   heresies that are creeping in and daily troubling us, I doubt not but
   the gospel, managed by an able self-denying ministry, will effectually
   disperse and shame them all.

   But you may say, this is not confessing sin, but applauding those whose
   sins you pretend to confess. To this I answer, it is the due
   acknowledgment of God's kindness, and thanksgiving for his admirable
   mercies, that I may not seem unthankful in confession, much less to
   cloud or vilify God's graces, while I open the frailties that in many
   do accompany them; for many things are sadly out of order in the best,
   as will appear from the following particulars.

   1. One of our most heinous and palpable sins is PRIDE. This is a sin
   that hath too much interest in the best of us, but which is more
   hateful and inexcusable in us than in other men. Yet is it so prevalent
   in some of us, that it inditeth our discourses, it chooseth our
   company, it formeth our countenances, it putteth the accent and
   emphasis upon our words. It fills some men's minds with aspiring
   desires, and designs: it possesseth them with envious and bitter
   thoughts against those who stand in their light, or who by any means
   eclipse their glory, or hinder the progress of their reputation. Oh
   what a constant companion, what a tyrannical commander, what a sly and
   subtle insinuating enemy, is this sin of pride! It goes with men to the
   draper, the mercer, the tailor: it chooseth them their cloth, their
   trimming, and their fashion. Fewer ministers would ruffle it out in the
   fashion in hair and habit, if it were not for the command of this
   tyrannous vice. And I would that this were all, or the worst. But,
   alas! how frequently doth it go with us to our study, and there sit
   with us and do our work! How oft doth it choose our subject, and, more
   frequently still, our words and ornaments! God commandeth us to be as
   plain as we can, that we may inform the ignorant; and as convincing and
   serious as we are able, that we may melt and change their hardened
   hearts. But pride stands by and contradicteth all, and produceth its
   toys and trifles. It polluteth rather than polisheth; and, under
   pretense of laudable ornaments, dishonoreth our sermons with childish
   gauds: as if a prince were to be decked in the habit of a stage-player,
   or a painted fool. It persuadeth us to paint the window, that it may
   dim the light: and to speak to our people that which they cannot
   understand; to let them know that we are able to speak unprofitably. If
   we have a plain and cutting passage, it taketh off the edge, and dulls
   the life of our preaching, under pretense of filing off' the roughness,
   unevenness, and superfluity. When God chargeth us to deal with men as
   for their lives, and to beseech them with all the earnestness that we
   are able, this cursed sin controlleth all, and condemneth the most holy
   commands of God, and saith to us, What! will you make people think you
   are mad? will you make them say you rage or rave? Cannot you speak
   soberly and moderately?' And thus doth pride make many a man's sermons;
   and what pride makes, the devil makes; and what sermons the devil will
   make and to what end, we may easily conjecture. Though the matter be of
   God, yet if the dress, and manner, and end be from Satan, we have no
   great reason to expect success.

   And when pride hath made the sermon, it goes with us into the pulpit,
   it formeth our tone, it animateth us in the delivery, it takes us off
   from that which may be displeasing, how necessary soever, and setteth
   us in pursuit of vain applause. In short, the sum of all is this, it
   maketh men, both in studying and preaching, to seek themselves, and
   deny God, when they should seek God's glory, and deny themselves. When
   they should inquire, What shall I say, and how shall I say it, to
   please God best, and do most good it makes them ask, What shall I say,
   and how shall I deliver it, to be thought a learned able preacher, and
   to be applauded by all that hear me? When the sermon is done, pride
   goeth home with them, and maketh them more eager to know whether they
   were applauded, than whether they did prevail for the saving of souls.
   Were it not for shame, they could find in their hearts to ask people
   how they liked them, and to draw out their commendations. If they
   perceive that they are highly thought of, they rejoice, as having
   attained their end; but if they see that they are considered but weak
   or common men, they are displeased, as having missed the prize they had
   in view.

   But even this is not all, nor the worst, if worse may be. Oh, that ever
   it should be said of godly ministers, that they are so set upon popular
   air, and on sitting highest in men's estimation, that they envy the
   talents and names of their brethren who are preferred before them, as
   if all were taken from their praise that is given to another; and as if
   God had given them his gifts, to be the mere ornaments and trappings of
   their persons, that they may walk as men of reputation in the world,
   and as if all his gifts to others were to be trodden down and vilified,
   if they seem to stand in the way of their honor! What a saint, a
   preacher of Christ, and yet envy that which hath the image of Christ,
   and malign his gifts for which he should have the glory, and all
   because they seem to hinder our glory. Is not every true Christian a
   member of the body of Christ, and, therefore, partaketh of the
   blessings of the whole, and of each particular member thereof? and doth
   not every man owe thanks to God for his brethren's gifts, not only as
   having himself a part in them, as the foot hath the benefit of the
   guidance of the eye; but also because his own ends may be attained by
   his brethren's gifts, as well as by his own? For if the glory of God,
   and the Church's felicity, be not his end, he is not a Christian. Will
   any workman malign another, because he helpeth him to do his master's
   work Yet, alas! how common is this heinous crime among the ministers of
   Christ! They can secretly blot the reputation of those that stand in
   the way of their own; and what they cannot for shame do in plain and
   open terms, lest they be proved liars and slanderers, they will do in
   generals, and by malicious intimations, raising suspicions where they
   cannot fasten accusations. And some go so far, that they are unwilling
   that any one who is abler than themselves should come into their
   pulpits, lest they should be more applauded than themselves. A fearful
   thing it is, that any man, who hath the least of the fear of God,
   should so envy God's gifts, and had rather than his carnal hearers
   should remain unconverted, and the drowsy unawakened, than that it
   should be done by another who may be preferred before him. Yea, so far
   doth this cursed vice prevail, that in great congregations, which have
   need of the help of many preachers, we can scarcely, in many places,
   get two of equality to live together in love and quietness, and
   unanimously to carry on the work of God. But unless one of them be
   quite below the other in parts, and content to be so esteemed, or
   unless he be a curate to the other, and ruled by him, they are
   contending for precedency, and envying each other's interest, and
   walking with strangeness and jealousy towards one another, to the shame
   of their profession, and the great wrong of their people. I am ashamed
   to think of it, that when I have been laboring to convince persons of
   public interest and capacity, of the great necessity of more ministers
   than one in large congregations, they tell me, they will never agree
   together. I hope the objection is unfounded as to the most; but it is a
   sad case that it should be true of any. Nay, some men are so far gone
   in pride, that when they might have an equal assistant to further the
   work of God, they had rather take all the burden upon themselves,
   though more than they can bear, than that any one should share with
   them in the honor, or that their interest in the esteem of the people
   should be diminished.

   Hence also it is that men do so magnify their own opinions, and are as
   censorious of any that differ from them in lesser things, as if it were
   all one to differ from them and from God. They expect that all should
   conform to their judgment, as if they were the rulers of the Church's
   faith; and while we cry down papal infallibility, too many of us would
   be popes ourselves, and have all stand to our determination, as if we
   were infallible. It is true, we have more modesty than expressly to say
   so; we pretend that it is only the evidence of truth, that appeareth in
   our reasons, that we expect men should yield to, and our zeal is for
   the truth and not for ourselves: but as that must needs be taken for
   truth which is ours, so our reasons must needs be taken for valid; and
   if they be but freely examined, and be found fallacious, as we are
   exceedingly backward to see it ourselves, because they are ours, so we
   are angry that it should be disclosed to others. We so espouse the
   cause of our errors, as if all that were spoken against them were
   spoken against our persons, and we were heinously injured to have our
   arguments thoroughly confuted, by which we injured the truth and the
   souls of men. The matter is come to this pass, through our pride, that
   if an error or fallacious argument do fall under the patronage of a
   reverend name, (which is nothing rare,) we must either allow it the
   victory, and give away the truth, or else become injurious to that name
   that doth patronize it; for though you meddle not with their persons,
   yet do they put themselves under all the strokes which you give their
   arguments; and feel them as sensibly as if you had spoken of
   themselves, because they think it will follow in the eyes of others,
   that weak arguing is a sign of a weak man. If, therefore, you consider
   it your duty to shame their errors and false reasonings, by discovering
   their nakedness, they take it as if you shamed their persons; and so
   their names must be a garrison or fortress to their mistakes, and their
   reverence must defend all their sayings from attack.

   So high indeed are our spirits, that when it becomes the duty of any
   one to reprove or contradict us, we are commonly impatient both of the
   matter and the manner. We love the man who will say as we say, and be
   of our opinion, and promote our reputation, though, in other respects,
   he be less worthy of our esteem. But he is ungrateful to us who
   contradicteth us and differeth from us, and dealeth plainly with us as
   to our miscarriages and telleth us of our faults. Especially in the
   management of our public arguings, where the eye of the world is upon
   us, we can scarcely endure any contradiction or plain dealing. I know
   that railing language is to be abhorred, and that we should be as
   tender of each other's reputation, as our fidelity to the truth will
   permit. But our pride makes too many of us think all men contemn us,
   that do not admire us, yea, and admire all we say, and submit their
   judgments to our most palpable mistakes. We are so tender, that a man
   can scarcely touch us but we are hurt; and so high-minded, that a man
   who is not versed in complimenting, and skilled in flattery above the
   vulgar rate, can scarcely tell how to handle us so observantly, and fit
   our expectations at every turn, without there being some word, or some
   neglect, which our high spirits will fasten on, and take as injurious
   to our honor.

   I confess I have often wondered that this most heinous sin should be
   made so light of, and thought so consistent with a holy frame of heart
   and life, when far less sins are, by ourselves, proclaimed to be so
   damnable in our people. And I have wondered more, to see the difference
   between godly preachers and ungodly sinners, in this respect. When we
   speak to drunkards, worldlings, or ignorant unconverted persons, we
   disgrace them to the utmost, and lay it on as plainly as we can speak,
   and tell them of their sin, and shame, and misery; and we expect that
   they should not only bear all patiently, but take all thankfully. And
   most that I deal with do take it patiently, and many gross sinners will
   commend the closest preachers most, and will say that they care not for
   hearing a man that will not tell them plainly of their sins. But if we
   speak to godly ministers against their errors or their sins, if we do
   not honor them and reverence them, and speak as smoothly as we are able
   to speak, yea, if we mix not commendations with our reproofs, and if
   the applause be not predominant, so as to drown all the force of the
   reproof or confutation, they take it as almost an insufferable injury.
   Brethren, I know this is a sad confession, but that all this should
   exist among us, should be more grievous to us than to be told of it.
   Could the evil be hid, I should not have disclosed it, at least so
   openly in the view of all. But, alas! it is long ago open to the eyes
   of the world. We have dishonored ourselves by idolizing our honor; we
   print our shame, and preach our shame, thus proclaiming it to the whole
   world. Some will think that I speak overcharitably when I call such
   persons godly men, in whom so great a sin doth so much prevail. I know,
   indeed, that where it is predominant, not hated, and bewailed, and
   mortified in the main, there can be no true godliness; and I beseech
   every man to exercise a strict jealousy and search of his own heart.
   But if all be graceless that are guilty of any, or of most of the
   forementioned discoveries of pride, the Lord be merciful to the
   ministers of this land, and give us quickly another spirit; for grace
   is then a rarer thing than most of us have supposed it to be. Yet I
   must needs say, that I do not mean to involve all the ministers of
   Christ in this charge. To the praise of Divine grace be it spoken, we
   have some among us, who are eminent for humility and meekness, and who,
   in these respects, are exemplary to their flocks and to their brethren.
   It is their glory, and shall be their glory; and maketh them truly
   honorable and lovely in the eyes of God and of all good men, and even
   in the eyes of the ungodly themselves. O that the rest of us were but
   such! But, alas! this is not the case with all of us.

   O that the Lord would lay us at his feet, in the tears of unfeigned
   sorrow for this sin! Brethren, may I expostulate this case a little
   with my own heart and yours, that we may see the evil of our sin, and
   be reformed! Is not pride the sin of devils -- the first-born of hell?
   Is it not that wherein Satan's image doth much consist? and is it to be
   tolerated in men who are so engaged against him and his kingdom as we
   are? The very design of the gospel is to abase us; and the work of
   grace is begun and carried on in humiliation. Humility is not a mere
   ornament of a Christian, but an essential part of the new creature. It
   is a contradiction in terms, to be a Christian, and not humble. All who
   will be Christians must be Christ's disciples, and come to him to
   learn,' and the lesson which he teacheth them is, to be meek and
   lowly.' Oh, how many precepts and admirable examples hath our Lord and
   Master given us to this end! Can we behold him washing and wiping his
   servants' feet, and yet be proud and lordly still? Shall he converse
   with the meanest of the people, and shall we avoid them as below our
   notice, and think none but persons of wealth and honor fit for our
   society? How many of us are oftener found in the houses of gentlemen
   than in the cottages of the poor, who most need our help? There are
   many of us who would think it below us, to be daily with the most needy
   and beggarly people, instructing them in the way of life and salvation;
   as if we had taken charge of the souls of the rich only! Alas! what is
   it that we have to be proud of? Is it of our body? Why, is it not made
   of the like materials as the brutes; and must it not shortly be as
   loathsome and abominable as a carcass? Is it of our graces? Why, the
   more we are proud of them, the less we have to be proud of. When so
   much of the nature of grace consists in humility, it is a great
   absurdity to be proud of it. Is it of our knowledge and learning? Why,
   if we have any knowledge at all, we must needs know how much reason we
   have to be humble; and if we know more than others, we must know more
   reason than others to be humble. How little is it that the most learned
   know, in comparison of that of which they are ignorant! To know that
   things are past your reach, and to know how ignorant you are, one would
   think should be no great cause of pride. However, do not the devils
   know more than you? And will you be proud of that in which the devils
   excel you? Our very business is to teach the great lesson of humility
   to our people; and how unfit, then, is it that we should be proud
   ourselves? We must study humility, and preach humility; and must we not
   possess and practice humility? A proud preacher of humility is at least
   a self-condemning man. What a sad case is it, that so vile a sin is not
   more easily discerned by us, but many who are most proud, can blame it
   in others, and yet take no notice of it in themselves! The world takes
   notice of some among us, that they have aspiring minds, and seek for
   the highest room, and must be the rulers, and bear the sway wherever
   they come, or else there is no living or acting with them. In any
   consultations, they come not to search after truth, but to dictate to
   others, who, perhaps, are fit to teach them. In a word, they have such
   arrogant domineering spirits, that the world rings of it, and yet they
   will not see it in themselves!

   Brethren, I desire to deal closely with my own heart and yours. I
   beseech you consider whether it will save us to speak well of the grace
   of humility while we possess it not, or to speak against the sin of
   pride while we indulge in it? Have not many of us cause to inquire
   diligently, whether sincerity will consist with such a measure of pride
   as we feel. When we are telling the drunkard that he cannot be saved
   unless he become temperate, and the fornicator that he cannot be saved
   unless he become chaste, have we not as great reason, if we are proud,
   to say to ourselves, that we cannot be saved unless we become humble.
   Pride, in fact, is a greater sin than drunkenness or whoredom; and
   humility is as necessary as sobriety and chastity. Truly, brethren, a
   man may as certainly, and more slyly, make haste to hell, in the way of
   earnest preaching of the gospel, and seeming zeal for a holy life, as
   in a way of drunkenness and filthiness. For what is holiness, but a
   devotedness to God and a living to him? and what is a damnable state,
   but a devotedness to carnal self and a living to ourselves? And doth
   any one live more to himself, or less to God, than the proud man? And
   may not pride make a preacher study for himself and pray and preach,
   and live to himself, even when he seemeth to surpass others in the
   work? It is not the work without the right principle and end that will
   prove us upright. The work may be God's, and yet we may do it, not for
   God, but for ourselves. I confess I feel such continual danger on this
   point, that if I do not watch, lest I should study for myself, and
   preach for myself, and write for myself, rather than for Christ, I
   should soon miscarry; and after all, I justify not myself, when I must
   condemn the sin. Consider, I beseech you, brethren, what baits there
   are in the work of the ministry, to entice a man to selfishness, even
   in the highest works of piety. The fame of a godly man is as great a
   snare as the fame of a learned man. But woe to him that takes up the
   fame of godliness instead of godliness! Verily I say unto you, they
   have their reward.' When the times were all for learning and empty
   formalities, the temptation of the proud did lie that way. But now,
   when, through the unspeakable mercy of God, the most lively practical
   preaching is in credit, and godliness itself is in credit, the
   temptation of the proud is to pretend to be zealous preachers and godly
   men. Oh, what a fine thing is it to have the people crowding to hear
   us, and affected with what we say, and yielding up to us their
   judgments and affections! What a taking thing is it to be cried up as
   the ablest and godliest man in the country, to be famed through the
   land for the highest spiritual excellencies! Alas, brethren, a little
   grace combined with such inducements, will serve to make you join
   yourselves with the forwardest, in promoting the cause of Christ in the
   world. Nay, pride may do it without special grace.

   Oh, therefore, be jealous of yourselves; and, amidst all your studies,
   be sure to study humility. He that exalteth himself shall be humbled,
   and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.' I commonly observe that
   almost all men, whether good or bad, do loathe the proud, and love the
   humble. So far indeed doth pride contradict itself, that, conscious of
   its own deformity, it often borrows the homely dress of humility. We
   have the more cause to be jealous of it, because it is a sin most
   deeply rooted in our nature, and as hardly as any extirpated from the
   soul.

   2. We do not so seriously, unreservedly, and laboriously lay out
   ourselves in the work of the Lord as beseemeth men of our profession
   and engagements. I bless the Lord that there are so many who do this
   work with all their might. But, alas! how imperfectly and how
   negligently do the most, even of those that we take for godly
   ministers, go through their work! How few of us do so behave ourselves
   in our office, as men that are wholly devoted thereto, and who have
   consecrated all they have to the same end! And because you shall see my
   grounds for this confession, I shall mention some instances of our
   sinful negligence.

   (1) If we were duly devoted to our work, we should not be so negligent
   in our studies. Few men are at the pains that are necessary for the
   right informing of their understanding, and fitting them for their
   further work. Some men have no delight in their studies, but take only
   now and then an hour, as an unwelcome task which they are forced to
   undergo, and are glad when they are from under the yoke. Will neither
   the natural desire of knowledge, nor the spiritual desire of knowing
   God and things Divine, nor the consciousness of our great ignorance and
   weakness, nor the sense of the weight of our ministerial work -- will
   none of all these things keep us closer to our studies, and make us
   more painful in seeking after truth? O what abundance of things are
   there that a minister should understand! and what a great defect is it
   to be ignorant of them! and how much shall we miss such knowledge in
   our work! Many ministers study only to compose their sermons, and very
   little more, when there are so many books to be read, and so many
   matters that we should not be unacquainted with. Nay, in the study of
   our sermons we are too negligent, gathering only a few naked truths,
   and not considering of the most forcible expressions by which we may
   set them home to men's consciences and hearts. We must study how to
   convince and get within men, and how to bring each truth to the quick,
   and not leave all this to our extemporary promptitude, unless in cases
   of necessity. Certainly, brethren, experience will teach you that men
   are not made learned or wise without hard study and unwearied labor and
   experience.

   (2) If we were heartily devoted to our work, it would be done more
   vigorously, and more seriously, than it is by the most of us. How few
   ministers do preach with all their might, or speak about everlasting
   joys and everlasting torments in such a manner as may make men believe
   that they are in good earnest! It would make a man's heart ache, to see
   a company of dead, drowsy sinners sitting under a minister, and not
   hear a word that is likely to quicken or awaken them. Alas! we speak so
   drowsily and so softly, that sleepy sinners cannot hear. The blow falls
   so light that hard-hearted sinners cannot feel. The most of ministers
   will not so much as exert their voice, and stir up themselves to an
   earnest utterance. But if they do speak loud and earnestly, how few do
   answer it with weight and earnestness of matter! And yet without this,
   the voice doth little good; the people will esteem it but mere bawling,
   when the matter doth not correspond. It would grieve one to the heart
   to hear what excellent doctrine some ministers have in hand, while yet
   they let it die in their hands for want of close and lively
   application; what fit matter they have for convincing sinners, and how
   little they make of it; what good they might do if they would set it
   home, and yet they cannot or will not do it.

   O sirs, how plainly, how closely, how earnestly, should we deliver a
   message of such moment as ours, when the everlasting life or
   everlasting death of our fellow-men is involved in it! Methinks we are
   in nothing so wanting as in this seriousness; yet is there nothing more
   unsuitable to such a business, than to be slight and dull. What! speak
   coldly for God, and for men's salvation? Can we believe that our people
   must be converted or condemned, and yet speak in a drowsy tone? In the
   name of God, brethren, labor to awaken your own hearts, before you go
   to the pulpit, that you may be fit to awaken the hearts of sinners.
   Remember they must be awakened or damned, and that a sleepy preacher
   will hardly awaken drowsy sinners. Though you give the holy things of
   God the highest praises in words, yet, if you do it coldly, you will
   seem by your manner to unsay what you said in the matter. It is a kind
   of contempt of great things, especially of so great things, to speak of
   them without much affection and fervency. The manner, as well as the
   words, must set them forth. If we are commanded, Whatsoever thy hand
   findeth to do, do it with all thy might,' then certainly such a work as
   preaching for men's salvation should be done with all our might. But,
   alas, how few in number are such men! It is only here and there, even
   among good ministers, that we find one who has an earnest, persuasive,
   powerful way of speaking, that the people can feel him preach when they
   hear him.

   Though I move you not to a constant loudness in your delivery (for that
   will make your fervency contemptible), yet see that you have a constant
   seriousness; and when the matter requireth it (as it should do, in the
   application at least), then lift up your voice, and spare not your
   spirits. Speak to your people as to men that must be awakened, either
   here or in hell. Look around upon them with the eye of faith, and with
   compassion, and think in what a state of joy or torment they must all
   be for ever; and then, methinks, it will make you earnest, and melt
   your heart to a sense of their condition. Oh, speak not one cold or
   careless word about so great a business as heaven or hell. Whatever you
   do, let the people see that you are in good earnest. Truly, brethren,
   they are great works which have to be done, and you must not think that
   trifling will despatch them. You cannot break men's hearts by jesting
   with them, or telling them a smooth tale, or pronouncing a gaudy
   oration. Men will not cast away their dearest pleasures at the drowsy
   request of one that seemeth not to mean as he speaks, or to care much
   whether his request be granted or not. If you say that the work is
   God's, and he may do it by the weakest means, I answer, It is true, he
   may do so; but yet his ordinary way is to work by means, and to make
   not only the matter that is preached, but also the manner of preaching
   instrumental to the work.

   With the most of our hearers, the very pronunciation and tone of speech
   is a great point. The best matter will scarcely move them, if it be not
   movingly delivered. See, especially, that there be no affectation, but
   that you speak as familiarly to them as you would do, if you were
   talking to any of them personally. The want of a familiar tone and
   expression is a great fault in most of our deliveries, and that which
   we should be very careful to amend. When a man hath a reading or
   declaiming tone, like a school-boy saying his lesson, or repeating an
   oration, few are moved with any thing that he says. Let us, therefore,
   rouse up ourselves to the work of the Lord, and speak to our people as
   for their lives, and save them as by violence, pulling them out of the
   fire.' Satan will not be charmed out of his possession: we must lay
   siege to the souls of sinners, which are his garrison, and find out
   where his chief strength lieth, and lay the battery of God's ordnance
   against it, and ply it close, till a breach is made; and then suffer
   them not by their shifts to repair it again. As we have reasonable
   creatures to deal with, and as they abuse their reason against the
   truth, we must see that our sermons be all convincing, and that we make
   the light of Scripture and Reason shine so bright in the faces of the
   ungodly, that it may even force them to see, unless they wilfully shut
   their eyes. A sermon full of mere words, how neatly soever it be
   composed, while it wants the light of evidence, and the life of zeal,
   is but an image or a well-dressed carcass.

   In preaching, there is a communion of souls, and a communication of
   somewhat from ours to theirs. As we and they have understandings and
   wills and affections, so must the bent of our endeavors be to
   communicate the fullest light of evidence from our understandings to
   theirs, and to warm their hearts, by kindling in them holy affections
   as by a communication from our own. The great things which we have to
   commend to our hearers have reason enough on their side, and lie plain
   before them in the Word of God. We should, therefore, be furnished with
   all kind of evidence, so that we may come as with a torrent upon their
   understandings, and with our reasonings and expostulations to pour
   shame upon all their vain objections, and bear down all before us, that
   they may be forced to yield to the power of truth.

   (3) If we are heartily devoted to the work of God, why do we not
   compassionate the poor unprovided congregations around us, and take
   care to help them to find able ministers; and, in the mean time, go out
   now and then to their assistance, when the business of our particular
   charge will give us any leave? A sermon in the more ignorant places,
   purposely for the work of conversion, delivered by the most lively,
   powerful preachers, might be a great help where constant means are
   wanting.

   3. Another sad discovery that we have not so devoted ourselves and all
   we have to the service of God as we ought, is our prevailing regard to
   our worldly interests in opposition to the interest and work of Christ.
   This I shall manifest in three instances:

   (1) The temporizing of ministers. I would not have any to be
   contentious with those that govern them, nor to be disobedient to any
   of their lawful commands. But it is not the least reproach of
   ministers, that the most of them, for worldly advantage, do always suit
   themselves to the party which is most likely to promote their ends. If
   they look for secular advantages, they suit themselves to the secular
   power; if for popular applause, they suit themselves to the Church
   party that is most in credit. This, alas! is an epidemical malady. In
   Constantine's days how prevalent were the Orthodox! In Constantius'
   days they almost all turned Arians, so that there were very few bishops
   that did not apostatize or betray the truth, even of the very men that
   had been in the Council of Nicaea. Indeed when not only Liberius, but
   great Ossius himself fell, who had been the president in so many
   orthodox councils, what better could be expected of weaker men Were it
   not for secular advantage, how should it come to pass that ministers,
   in all countries of the world, are either all, or almost all, of that
   religion that is most in credit, and most consistent with their worldly
   interests? Among the Greeks, they are all of the Greek profession:
   among the Papists, they are almost all Papists: in Norway, Sweden, and
   Denmark, they are almost all Lutherans: and so in other countries. It
   is strange that they should be all in the right in one country, and all
   in the wrong in another, if carnal advantages did not sway much with
   men, when they engage in the search of truth. The variety of intellect,
   and numberless other circumstances, would unavoidably occasion a great
   variety of opinions on various points. But let the prince, and the
   stream of men in power, go one way, and you shall have the generality
   of ministers agree with them to a hair, and that without any
   extraordinary search. How generally did the common sort of ministers
   change their religion with the prince, at several times, in this land!
   Not all, indeed, as our Martyrology can witness, but yet the most. And
   the same tractable distemper doth still follow us; so that it
   occasioneth our enemies to say, that reputation and preferment are our
   religion and our reward.

   (2) We too much mind worldly things, and shrink from duties that will
   injure or hinder our temporal interests. How common is it for ministers
   to drown themselves in worldly business! Too many are such as the
   sectaries would have us to be, who tell us that we should go to the
   plough and labor for our living, and preach without so much study. This
   is a lesson which is easily learned. Men show no anxiety to cast off
   care, that their own souls and the Church may have all their care.

   And especially, how commonly are those duties neglected, that are
   likely, if performed, to diminish our estates! Are there not many, for
   example, that dare not, that will not, set up the exercise of
   discipline in their churches, because it may hinder the people from
   paying them their dues? They will not offend sinners with discipline,
   lest they offend them in their estates. I find money is too strong an
   argument for some men to answer, that yet can proclaim the love of it
   to be the root of all evil,' and can make long orations of the danger
   of covetousness. I will at present say no more to them but this: If it
   was so deadly a sin in Simon Magus to offer to buy the gift of God with
   money, what is it to sell his gift, his cause, and the souls of men for
   money? And what reason have we to fear, lest our money perish with us!

   (3) Our barrenness in works of charity, and in improving all we have
   for our Master's service. If worldly interest did not much prevail
   against the interest of Christ and the Church, surely most ministers
   would be more fruitful in good works, and would more lay out what they
   have for his glory.

   Experience hath fully proved that works of charity do most powerfully
   remove prejudice, and open the heart to words of piety. If men see that
   you are addicted to do good, they will the more easily believe that you
   are good, and that it is good which you persuade them to. When they see
   that you love them, and seek their good, they will the more easily
   trust you. And when they see that you seek not the things of the world,
   they will the less suspect your intentions, and the more easily be
   drawn by you to seek that which you seek. Oh, how much good might
   ministers do, if they did set themselves wholly to do good, and would
   dedicate all their faculties and substance to that end! Say not that it
   is a small matter to do good to men's bodies, and that this will but
   win them to us, and not to God; for it is prejudice that is a great
   hindrance of men's conversion, and this will help to remove it. We
   might do men more good, if they were but willing to learn of us; and
   this will make them willing, and then our further diligence may profit
   them. I beseech you, brethren, do not think that it is ordinary charity
   that is expected from you, any more than ordinary piety. You must, in
   proportion to your talents, go much beyond others. It is not enough to
   give a little to a poor man: others do that as well as you. But what
   singular thing do you do with your estates for your Master's service? I
   know you cannot give away that which you have not; but methinks all
   that you have should be devoted to God. I know the great objection is,
   We have a wife and children to provide for: a little will not serve
   them at present, and we are not bound to leave them beggars.' To this I
   answer:

   [a] There are few texts of Scripture more abused than that of the
   apostle, He that provideth not for his own, and specially for those of
   his own house, hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.'
   This is made a pretense for gathering up portions, and providing a full
   estate for posterity, when the apostle speaketh only against them that
   did cast their poor kindred and family on the Church, to be maintained
   out of the common stock, when they were able to do it themselves; as if
   one that hath a widow in his house that is his mother or daughter, and
   would have her to be kept by the parish, when he hath enough himself.
   The following words show that it is present provision, and not future
   portions, that the apostle speaketh of, when he bids them that have
   widows relieve them, and let not the church be charged, that it may
   relieve them that are widows indeed.'

   [b] You may so educate your children as other persons do, that they may
   be able to gain their own livelihood by some honest trade or
   employment, without other great provisions. I know that your charity
   and care must begin at home, but it must not end there. You are bound
   to do the best you can to educate your children, so as they may be
   capable of being most serviceable to God, but not to leave them rich,
   nor to forbear other necessary works of charity, merely to make a
   larger provision for them. There must be some proportion between the
   provision we make for our families, and for the Church of Christ. A
   truly charitable self-denying heart, that hath devoted itself, and all
   that it hath, to God, would be the best judge of the due proportions,
   and would see which way of expense is likely to do God the greatest
   service, and that way it would take.

   [c] I confess I would not have men lie too long under temptations to
   incontinency, lest they wound themselves and their profession by their
   falls. But yet methinks it is hard that men can do no more to mortify
   the concupiscence of the flesh, that they may live in a single
   condition, and have none of those temptations from wife and children,
   to hinder them from furthering their ministerial ends by charitable
   works. If he that marrieth not doth better than he that doth marry,
   surely ministers should labor to do that which is best. And if he that
   can receive this saying,' must receive it, we should endeavor after it.
   This is one of the highest points of the Romish policy, which alleges
   that it is the duty of bishops, priests, and other religious orders,
   not to marry, by which means they have no posterity to drain the
   church's revenues, nor to take up their care; but they make the public
   cause to be their interest, and they lay out themselves for it while
   they live, and leave all they have to it when they die. It is a pity
   that for a better cause we can no more imitate them in self-denial,
   where it might be done.

   [d] But they that must marry, should take such as can maintain
   themselves and their children, or maintain them at the rate which their
   temporal means will afford, and devote as much of the church's means to
   the church's service as they can.

   I would put no man upon extremes. But in this case, flesh and blood
   doth even make good men so partial, that they take their duties, and
   duties of very great worth and weight, to be extremes. If worldly
   vanities did not blind us, we might see when a public, or other greater
   good, did call us to deny ourselves and our families. Why should we not
   live more nearly and poorer in the world, rather than leave those works
   undone, which may be of greater use than our plentiful provision? But
   we consult in points of duty with flesh and blood; and what counsel it
   will give us, we may easily know. It will tell us we must have a
   competency; and many pious men's competency is but little below the
   rich man's rates in the parable (Luke 16:19.). If they be not clothed
   in the best, and fare sumptuously every day,' they have not a
   competency. A man that preacheth an immortal crown, should not seek
   much after transitory vanity. And he that preacheth the contempt of
   riches should himself contemn them and show it by his life. And he that
   preacheth self-denial and mortification should practice these virtues
   in the eyes of them to whom he preacheth, if he would have his doctrine
   believed. All Christians are sanctified; and, therefore, themselves,
   and all that they have, are consecrated to the Master's use.' But
   ministers are doubly sanctified: they are devoted to God, both as
   Christians and as ministers; and, therefore, they are doubly obligated
   to honor him with all they have. Oh, brethren, what abundance of good
   works are before us, and to how few of them do we put our hands! I know
   the world expecteth more from us than we have; but if we cannot answer
   the expectations of the unreasonable, let us do what we can to answer
   the expectations of God, and of conscience, and of all just men. This
   is the will of God, that with well doing we should put to silence the
   ignorance of foolish men.' Those ministers especially, that have larger
   incomes, must be larger in doing good. I will give but one instance at
   this time. There are some ministers who have a hundred and fifty, two
   hundred, or three hundred pounds a-year of salary, and have so large
   parishes, that they are not able to do a quarter of the ministerial
   work, nor once in a year to deal personally with half their people for
   their instruction, and yet they will content themselves with public
   preaching, as if that were all that was necessary, and leave almost all
   the rest undone, to the everlasting danger or damnation of multitudes,
   rather than maintain one or two diligent men to assist them. Or if they
   have an assistant, it is but some young man who is but poorly qualified
   for the work, and not one that will faithfully and diligently watch
   over the flock, and afford them that personal instruction which is so
   necessary. If this be not serving ourselves of God, and selling men's
   souls for our fuller maintenance in the world, what is? Methinks such
   men should fear, lest, while they are accounted excellent preachers and
   godly ministers by men, they should be accounted cruel soul-murderers
   by Christ; and lest the cries of those souls which they have betrayed
   to damnation, should ring in their ears for ever and ever. Will
   preaching a good sermon serve the turn, while you never look more after
   them, but deny them that closer help that is necessary, and alienate
   that maintenance to your own flesh, which should provide relief for so
   many souls? How can you open your mouths against oppressors, when you
   yourselves are so great oppressors, not only of men's bodies, but of
   their souls? How can you preach against unmercifulness, while you are
   so unmerciful? And how can you talk against unfaithful ministers, while
   you are so unfaithful yourselves? The sin is not small because it is
   unobserved, and is not odious in the eyes of men, or because the
   charity which you withhold is such as the people blame you not for
   withholding. Satan himself, their greatest enemy, hath their consent
   all along in the work of their perdition. It is no extenuation,
   therefore, of your sin, that you have their consent: for that you may
   sooner have for their everlasting hurt, than for their everlasting
   good.

   And now, sirs, I beseech you to take what has been said into
   consideration; and see whether this be not the great and lamentable sin
   of the ministers of the gospel, that they be not fully devoted to God,
   and give not up themselves, and all that they have, to the carrying on
   of the blessed work which they have undertaken; and whether
   flesh-pleasing, and self-seeking, and an interest distinct from that of
   Christ, do not make us neglect much of our duty, and serve God in the
   cheapest and most applauded part of his work, and withdraw from that
   which would subject us to cost and sufferings? And whether this do not
   show, that too many of us are earthly that seem to be heavenly, and
   mind the things below, while they preach the things above, and idolize
   the world while they call men to contemn it? And as Salvian saith, No
   one neglects salvation more than he who prefers something above God':
   Despisers of God will prove despisers of their own salvation.

   4. We are sadly guilty of undervaluing the unity and peace of the whole
   Church. Though I scarcely meet with any one who will not speak for
   unity and peace, or, at least, that will expressly speak against it,
   yet is it not common to meet with those who are studious to promote it;
   but too commonly do we find men averse to it, and jealous of it, if not
   themselves the instruments of division. The Papists have so long abused
   the name of the catholic Church, that, in opposition to them, many
   either put it out of their creeds, or only retain the name while they
   understand not, or consider not the nature of the thing; or think it is
   enough to believe that there is such a body, though they behave not
   themselves as members of it. If the Papists will idolize the Church,
   shall we therefore deny it, disregard it, or divide it? It is a great
   and a common sin throughout the Christian world, to take up religion in
   a way of faction; and instead of a love and tender care of the
   universal Church, to confine that love and respect to a party. Not but
   that we must prefer, in our estimation and communion, the purer parts
   before the impure, and refuse to participate with any in their sins;
   yet the most infirm and diseased part should be compassionated and
   assisted to the utmost of our power; and communion must be held as far
   as is lawful, and nowhere avoided, but upon the urgency of necessity;
   as we must love those of our neighborhood that have the plague or
   leprosy, and afford them all the relief we can, and acknowledge all our
   just relations to them, and communicate to them, though we may not have
   local communion with them; and in other diseases which are not so
   infectious, we may be the more with them for their help, by how much
   the more they need it.

   Of the multitude that say they are of the catholic Church, it is rare
   to meet with men of a catholic spirit. Men have not a universal
   consideration of, and respect to, the whole Church, but look upon their
   own party as if it were the whole. If there be some called Lutherans,
   some Calvinists, some subordinate divisions among these, and so of
   other parties among us, most of them will pray hard for the prosperity
   of their party, and rejoice and give thanks when it goes well with
   them; but if any other party suffer, they little regard it, as if it
   were no loss at all to the Church. If it be the smallest parcel that
   possesseth not many nations, no, nor cities on earth, they are ready to
   carry it, as if they were the whole Church, and as if it went well with
   the Church when it goes well with them. We cry down the Pope as
   Antichrist, for including the Church in the Romish pale, and no doubt
   but it is abominable schism: but, alas! how many do imitate them too
   far, while they reprove them! And as the Papists foist the word Roman
   into their creed, and turn the catholic Church into the Roman Catholic
   church, as if there were no other catholics, and the Church were of no
   larger extent, so is it with many others as to their several parties.
   Some will have it to be the Lutheran catholic church, and some the
   Reformed catholic church; some the Anabaptist catholic church, and so
   of some others. And if they differ not among themselves, they are
   little troubled at differing from others, though it be from almost all
   the Christian world. The peace of their party they take for the peace
   of the Church. No wonder, therefore, if they carry it no further.

   How rare is it to meet with a man that smarteth or bleedeth with the
   Church's wounds, or sensibly taketh them to heart as his own, or that
   ever had solicitous thoughts of a cure! No; but almost every party
   thinks that the happiness of the rest consisteth in turning to them;
   and because they be not of their mind, they cry, Down with them! and
   are glad to hear of their fall, as thinking that is the way to the
   Church's rising, that is, their own. How few are there who understand
   the true state of controversies between the several parties; or that
   ever well discerned how many of them are but verbal, and how many are
   real! And if those that understand it do, in order to right information
   and accommodation, disclose it to others, it is taken as an extenuation
   of their error, and as a carnal compliance with them in their sin. Few
   men grow zealous for peace till they grow old, or have much experience
   of men's spirits and principles, and see better the true state of the
   Church, and the several differences, than they did before. And then
   they begin to write their Irenicons, and many such are extant at this
   day. As a young man in the heat of his lust and passion was judged to
   be no fit auditor of moral philosophy, so we find that those same young
   men who may be zealous for peace and unity, when they are grown more
   experienced, are zealous for their factions against these in their
   youthful heat. And therefore, such peace-makers as these
   before-mentioned do seldom do much greater good than to quiet their own
   consciences in the discharge of so great a duty, and to moderate some
   few, and save them from further guilt, and to leave behind them, when
   they are dead, a witness against a wilful, self-conceited, unpeaceable
   world. Nay, commonly it bringeth a man under suspicion either of
   favoring some heresy or abating his zeal, if he do but attempt a
   pacificatory work. As if there were no zeal necessary for the great
   fundamental verities of the Church's unity and peace, but only for
   parties, and some particular truths. And a great advantage the devil
   hath got this way, by employing his own agents, the unhappy Socinians,
   in writing so many treatises for catholic and arch-catholic unity and
   peace, which they did for their own ends; by which means the enemy of
   peace hath brought it to pass, that whoever maketh motion for peace, is
   presently under suspicion of being one that hath need of it for an
   indulgence to his own errors. A fearful case, that heresy should be
   credited, as if none were such friends to unity and peace as they; and
   that so great and necessary a duty, upon which the Church's welfare
   doth so depend, should be brought into such suspicion or disgrace.
   Brethren, I speak not all this without apparent reason. We have as sad
   divisions among us in England, considering the piety of the persons,
   and the smallness of the matter of our discord, as most nations under
   heaven have known. The most that keeps us at odds is but the right form
   and order of Church government. Is the distance so great, that
   Presbyterian, Episcopalian, and Independent might not be well agreed?
   Were they but heartily willing and forward for peace, they might. I
   know they might. I have spoken with some moderate men of all the
   parties, and I perceive, by their concessions, it were an easy work.
   Were men's hearts but sensible of the Church's case, and unfeignedly
   touched with love to one another, and did they but heartily set
   themselves to seek it, the settling of a safe and happy peace were an
   easy work. If we could not in every point agree, we might easily narrow
   our differences, and hold communion upon our agreement in the main;
   determining on the safest way for managing our few and small
   disagreements, without the danger or trouble of the Church. But is this
   much done? It is not done. To the shame of all our faces be it spoken,
   it is not done. Let each party flatter themselves now as they please,
   it will be recorded to the shame of the ministry of England while the
   gospel shall abide in the world.

   And oh what heinous aggravations do accompany this sin! Never men,
   since the apostles' days, I think, did make greater profession of
   godliness. The most of them are bound by solemn oaths and covenants,
   for unity and reformation: they all confess the worth of peace, and
   most of them will preach for it, and talk for it, while yet they sit
   still and neglect it, as if it were not worth the looking after. They
   will read and preach on those texts that command us to follow peace
   with all men,' and as much as in us lieth, to live peaceably with
   them,' and yet they are so far from following it, and doing all they
   possibly can for it, that many snarl at it, and malign and censure any
   that endeavor to promote it; as if all zeal for peace did proceed from
   an abatement of our zeal for holiness; and as if holiness and peace
   were so fallen out, that there were no reconciling them: when yet it
   has been found, by long experience, that concord is a sure friend to
   piety, and piety always moves to concord; while, on the other hand,
   errors and heresies are bred by discord, as discord is bred and fed by
   them. We have seen, to our sorrow, that where the servants of God
   should have lived together as one -- of one heart, and one soul, and
   one lip -- and should have promoted each other's faith and holiness,
   and admonished and assisted each other against sin, and rejoiced
   together in the hope of future glory, we have, on the contrary, lived
   in mutual jealousies, and drowned holy love in bitter contentions, and
   studied to disgrace and undermine one another, and to increase our own
   parties by right or wrong. We, that were wont to glory of our love to
   the brethren as a mark of our sincerity in the faith, have now turned
   it into the love of a party only; and those that are against that party
   have more of our spleen and envy and malice, than our love. I know this
   is not so with all, nor prevalently with any true believer; but yet it
   is so common, that it may cause us to question the sincerity of many
   that are thought by themselves and others to be most sincere. And it is
   not ourselves only that are scorched in this flame, but we have drawn
   our people into it, and cherished them in it, so that most of the godly
   in the nation are fallen into parties, and have turned much of their
   ancient piety into vain opinions and disputes and envyings and
   animosities. Yea, whereas it was wont to be made the certain mark of a
   graceless wretch to deride the godly, how few are there now that stick
   at secretly deriding and slandering those that are not of their
   opinions! A pious Prelatical man can reverently scorn and slander a
   Presbyterian; and a Presbyterian an Independent; and an Independent
   both. And, what is the worst of all, the common ignorant people take
   notice of all this, and do not only deride us, but are hardened by us
   against religion; and when we go about to persuade them to be
   religious, they see so many parties, that they know not which to join;
   and think that it is as good to be of none at all, as of any, since
   they are uncertain which is the right; and thus thousands are grown
   into a contempt of all religion, by our divisions; and many poor carnal
   wretches begin to think themselves in the better case of the two,
   because they hold to their old formalities, when we hold to nothing. I
   know that some of these men are learned and reverend, and intend not
   such mischievous ends as these. The hardening of men in ignorance is
   not their design. But this is the thing effected. To intend well in
   doing ill is no rarity. Who can, in reverence to any man on earth, sit
   still and hold his tongue, while he seeth people thus run to their own
   destruction, and the souls of men undone by the contentions of divines
   for their several parties and interests? The Lord that knows my heart,
   knows, (if I know it myself,) that as I am not of any one of these
   parties, so I speak not a word of this in a factious partiality for one
   party, or against another, as such, much less in spleen against any
   person; but if I durst in conscience, I would have silenced all this,
   for fear of giving them offense whom I must honor. But what am I but a
   servant of Christ? and what is my life worth, but to do him service?
   and whose favor can recompense me for the ruin of the Church? and who
   can be silent while souls are undone? Not I, for my part, while God is
   my Master, and his word my rule; his work my business; and the success
   of it, for the saving of souls, my end. Who can be reconciled to that
   which so lamentably crosseth his Master's interest, and his main end in
   life? Nor yet would I have spoken any of this, had it been only in
   respect to my own charge, where, I bless God, the sore is but small, in
   comparison of what it is in many other places. But the knowledge of
   some neighboring congregations, and of others more remote, hath drawn
   out these observations from me. We may talk of peace, indeed, as long
   as we live, but we shall never obtain it but by returning to the
   apostolical simplicity. The Papists' faith is too big for all men to
   agree upon, or even all their own, if they enforced it not with
   arguments drawn from the fire, the halter, and the strappado. And many
   Anti-papists do too much imitate them in the tedious length of their
   subscribed confessions, and the novelty of their impositions, when they
   go furthest from them in the quality of the things imposed. When we
   once return to the ancient simplicity of faith, then, and not till
   then, shall we return to the ancient love and peace. I would therefore
   recommend to all my brethren, as the most necessary thing to the
   Church's peace, that they unite in necessary truths, and bear with one
   another in things that may be borne with; and do not make a larger
   creed, and more necessaries, than God hath done. To this end, let me
   entreat you to attend to the following things:

   (1) Lay not too great a stress upon controverted opinions, which have
   godly men, and, especially, whole churches, on both sides.

   (2) Lay not too great a stress on those controversies that are
   ultimately resolvable into philosophical uncertainties, as are some
   unprofitable controversies about freewill, the manner of the Spirit's
   operations and the Divine decrees.

   (3) Lay not too great a stress on those controversies that are merely
   verbal, and which if they were anatomized, would appear to be no more.
   Of this sort are far more (I speak it confidently upon certain
   knowledge) that make a great noise in the world, and tear the Church,
   than almost any of the eager contenders that ever I spoke with do seem
   to discern, or are like to believe.

   (4) Lay not too much stress on any point of faith which was disowned by
   or unknown to the whole Church of Christ, in any age, since the
   Scriptures were delivered to us.

   (5) Much less should you lay great stress on those of which any of the
   more pure or judicious ages were wholly ignorant.

   (6) And least of all should you lay much stress on any point which no
   one age since the apostles did ever receive, but all commonly held the
   contrary.

   I know it is said that a man may subscribe the Scripture, and the
   ancient creeds, and yet maintain Socinianism, or other heresies. To
   which I answer, So he may another test which your own brains shall
   contrive: and while you make a snare to catch heretics, instead of a
   test for the Church's communion, you will miss your end; and the
   heretic, by the slipperiness of his conscience, will break through, and
   the tender Christian may possibly be ensnared. And by your new creed
   the Church is like to have new divisions, if you keep not close to the
   words of Scripture.

   He that shall live to that happy time when God will heal his broken
   churches, will see all this that I am pleading for reduced to practice,
   and this moderation takes place of the new-dividing zeal, and the
   doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture established; and all men's
   confessions and comments valued only as subservient helps, and not made
   the test of Church communion, any further than they are the same with
   Scripture. Till, however, the healing age come, we cannot expect that
   healing truths will be entertained, because there are not healing
   spirits in the leaders of the Church. But when the work is to be done,
   the workmen will be fitted for it; and blessed will be the agents of so
   glorious a work.

   5. Lastly, We are sadly negligent in performing acknowledged duties,
   for example, church discipline. If there be any work of reformation to
   be set afoot, how many are there that will go no further than they are
   drawn! It were well if all would do even that much. And when a work is
   like to prove difficult and costly, how backward are we to it, and how
   many excuses do we make for the omission of it! What hath been more
   talked of, and prayed for, and contended about in England, for many
   years past, than discipline? There are, in fact, but few men who do not
   seem zealous in disputing for one side or other; some for the
   Prelatical way, some for the Presbyterian, and some for the
   Congregational. And yet, when we come to the practice of it, for aught
   I see, we are quite agreed: most of us are for no way. It hath made me
   wonder, sometimes, to look on the face of England, and see how few
   congregations in the land have any considerable execution of
   discipline, and to think withal what volumes have been written for it,
   and how almost all the ministry of the nation are engaged for it. How
   zealously they have contended for it, and made many a just exclamation
   against the opposers of it, and yet, notwithstanding all this, they
   will do little or nothing in the exercise of it. I have marvelled what
   should make them so zealous in siding for that which their practice
   shows their hearts are against. But I see a disputing zeal is more
   natural than a holy, obedient, practising zeal. How many ministers are
   there in England that know not their own charge, and cannot tell who
   are the members of it; that never cast out one obstinate sinner, nor
   brought one to public confession and promise of reformation, nor even
   admonished one publicly to call him to such repentance! But they think
   they do their duty, if they give them not the sacrament of the Lord's
   supper, (when it is perhaps avoided voluntarily by the persons
   themselves); and in the mean time, we leave them stated members of our
   churches, (for church membership does not consist merely in partaking
   of the Lord's supper, else what are children who have been baptized in
   their infancy?) and grant them all other communion with the Church, and
   call them not to personal repentance for their sin. Is it not God's
   ordinance that they should be personally rebuked and admonished, and
   publicly called to repentance, and be cast out if they remain
   impenitent? If these be no duties, why have we made such a noise and
   stir in the world about them? If they be duties, why do we not practice
   them? Many of them avoid the very hearing of the Word. The ancient
   discipline of the Church was stricter, when the Sixth General Council
   at Trull ordained, that Whosoever was three days together from church,
   without urgent necessity, was to be excommunicated.'

   Brethren, I desire not to offend any party, but I must needs say that
   these sins are not to be cloaked over with excuses, extenuations, or
   denials. We have long cried up discipline, and every party its
   particular way. Would you have people value your form of government, or
   would you not? No doubt but you would. Now, if you would have them
   value it, it must be for some excellency. Show them then that
   excellency. What is it? Wherein doth it consist? And if you would have
   them believe you, show it to them, not merely on paper, but in
   practice; not simply in words, but in deeds. How can the people know
   the worth of discipline, without the thing? Is it a name and a shadow
   that you have made all this noise about? How can they think that to be
   good, which doth no good? Truly, I fear we take not the right way to
   maintain our cause; that we even betray it, while we are hot disputers
   for it. Speak truly: is it not these two things that keep up the
   reputation of the long-contended-for discipline among men; namely, with
   the godly, the mere reputation of their ministers that stand for it,
   and with many of the ungodly, the non-execution of it, because they
   find it to be toothless, and not so troublesome to them as they
   expected? If once our Government come to be upholden by the votes of
   those who should be corrected or ejected by it, and the worst men be
   friends to it because it is a friend to them in their ungodliness, we
   shall then engage the Lord against it, and he will appear as engaged
   against us. Set all the execution of discipline together that hath been
   practiced in a whole county, ever since it was so contended for, and I
   doubt it will not appear so observable as to draw godly people into a
   liking of it for its effects. How can you wonder, if many that desire
   deeds and not words, reformation, and not merely the name of
   reformation, do turn over to the separated congregations, when you show
   them nothing but the bare name of discipline in yours? All Christians
   value God's ordinances, and think them not vain things; and, therefore,
   are unwilling to live without them. Discipline is not a needless thing
   to the Church: if you will not make a difference between the precious
   and the vile, by discipline, people will do it by separation. If you
   will keep many scores or hundreds in your churches, that are
   notoriously ignorant, and utterly destitute of religion, and never
   publicly (nor, perhaps, privately) reprove them, nor call them to
   repentance, nor cast them out, you need not marvel if some timorous
   souls should run out of your churches, as from a ruinous edifice, which
   they fear is ready to fall upon their heads. Consider, I pray you, if
   you should act in the same manner with them as to the sacrament, as you
   do as to discipline, and should only show them the bread and wine, and
   never let them taste of these memorials of their Redeemer's love, could
   you expect that the name of a sacrament would satisfy them, or that
   they would like your communion? Why should you then think that they
   will be satisfied with the empty sound of the word church-government?

   Besides, consider what a disadvantage you cast upon your cause, in all
   your disputations with men of different views. If your principles be
   better than theirs, and their practice be better than yours, the people
   will suppose that the question is whether the name or the thing, the
   shadow or the substance, be more desirable, and they will take your way
   to be a mere delusive formality, because they see you but formal in the
   use of it, yea, that you use it not at all. In what I now say, I speak
   not against your form of government, but for it; and tell you, that it
   is you who are against it that seem so earnest for it, while you more
   disgrace it for want of exercise, than you credit it by all your
   arguments. And you will find, before you have done, that the faithful
   execution of it would be your strongest argument. Till then, the people
   will understand you, as if you openly proclaimed, We would have no
   public admonitions, confessions, or excommunications; our way is to do
   no good, but to set up the naked name of a government. I desire not to
   spur on any one to an unseasonable performance of this great duty. But
   will it never be a fit season? Would you forbear sermons and sacraments
   so many years on pretense of unseasonableness? Will you have a better
   season for it when you are dead? How many are dead already, before they
   ever did anything in this important work, though they were long
   preparing for it! I know some have more discouragements and hindrances
   than others; but what discouragements and hindrances can excuse us from
   such a duty? Besides the reasons which we have already stated, let
   these few be seriously considered:

   (1) How sad a sign do we make it to be in preaching to our people, to
   live in the wilful and continued omission of any known duty! And shall
   we do so year after year, nay, all our days? If excuses will take off
   the danger of this sign, what man will not find them as well as you?

   (2) We plainly manifest laziness and sloth, if not unfaithulness in the
   work of Christ. I speak from experience. It was laziness that kept me
   so long from this duty, and pleaded hard against it. It is indeed a
   troublesome and painful work, and such as calls for some self-denial,
   because it will bring upon us the displeasure of the wicked. But dare
   we prefer our carnal ease and quietness, or the love and peace of
   wicked men, before our service to Christ our Master? Can slothful
   servants expect a good reward? Remember, brethren, that we of this
   county have thus promised before God, in the second article of our
   agreement: We agree and resolve, by God's help, that so far as God doth
   make known our duty to us, we will faithfully endeavor to discharge it,
   and will not desist through any fears or losses in our estates, or the
   frowns and displeasure of men, or any the like carnal inducements
   whatsoever.' I pray you study this promise, and compare your
   performance with it. And do not think that you were ensnared by thus
   engaging; for God's law hath laid an obligation on you to the very same
   duty, before your engagement did it. Here is nothing but what others
   are bound to, as well as you.

   (3) The neglect of discipline hath a strong tendency to delude immortal
   souls, by making those think they are Christians that are not, while
   they are permitted to live with the character of such, and are not
   separated from the rest by God's ordinance: and it may make the
   scandalous think their sin a tolerable thing, which is so tolerated by
   the pastors of the church.

   (4) We corrupt Christianity itself in the eyes of the world, and do our
   part to make them believe that Christ is no more for holiness than
   Satan, or that the Christian religion exacteth holiness no more than
   the false religions of the world. For if the holy and unholy are all
   permitted to be sheep of the same fold, without any means being used to
   separate them, we defame the Redeemer, as if he were guilty of it, and
   as if this were the nature of his precepts.

   (5) We keep up separation, by permitting the worst to be uncensured in
   our churches, so that many honest Christians think they are obliged to
   withdraw from us. I have spoken with some members of the separated
   churches, who were moderate men, and have argued with them against
   separation; and they have assured me, that they were of the
   Presbyterian judgment, or had nothing to say against it, but they
   joined themselves to other churches from pure necessity, thinking that
   discipline, being an ordinance of Christ, must be used by all that can,
   and, therefore, they durst no longer live without it when they might
   have it; and they could find no Presbyterian churches that executed
   discipline, as they wrote for it: and they told me, that they separated
   only pro tempore, till the Presbyterians will use discipline, and then
   they will willingly return to them again. I confess I was sorry that
   such persons had any such occasion to withdraw from us. It is not
   keeping offenders from the sacrament that will excuse us from the
   further exercise of discipline, while they are members of our churches.

   (6) We do much to bring the wrath of God upon ourselves and our
   congregations, and so to blast the fruit of our labors. If the angel of
   the church of Thyatira was reproved for suffering seducers in the
   church, we may be reproved, on the same ground, for suffering open,
   scandalous, impenitent sinners.

   And what are the hindrances that now keep the ministers of England from
   the execution of that discipline, for which they have so much
   contended? The great reason, as far as I can learn, is, The difficulty
   of the work, and the trouble or suffering that we are like to incur by
   it. We cannot publicly reprehend one sinner, but he will storm at it,
   and bear us a deadly malice. We can prevail with very few to make a
   public profession of true repentance. If we proceed to excommunicate
   them, they will be raging mad against us. If we should deal as God
   requireth us, with all the obstinate sinners in the parish, there would
   be no living among them; we should be so hated of all, that, as our
   lives would be uncomfortable, so our labors would become unprofitable;
   for men would not hear us when they are possessed with a hatred of us:
   therefore duty ceaseth to be duty to us, because the hurt that would
   follow would be greater than the good.' These are the great reasons for
   the non-execution of discipline, together with the great labor that
   private admonition of each offender would cost us. Now, to all this I
   answer:

   [a] Are not these reasons as valid against Christianity itself,
   especially in some times and places, as they are against discipline?
   Christ came not to send peace on earth: We shall have his peace, but
   not the world's; for he hath told us that it will hate us. Might not
   Bradford, or Hooper, or any that were burned in Queen Mary's days) have
   alleged more than all his against the duty of owning the Reformation?
   Might they not have said, It will make us hated and it will expose our
   very lives to the flames?' He is concluded by Christ to be no
   Christian, who hateth not all that he hath, and his own life, for him;
   and yet we can take the hazard of worldly loss as a reason against his
   work! What is it but hypocrisy to shrink from sufferings, and to take
   up none but safe and easy works, and make ourselves believe that the
   rest are no duties? Indeed this is the common way of escaping
   suffering, to neglect the duty that would expose us to it. If we did
   our duty faithfully, ministers would find the same lot among professed
   Christians as their predecessors have done among Pagans and other
   infidels. But if you cannot suffer for Christ, why did you put your
   hand to his plough? Why did you not first sit down and count the cost?
   This makes the ministerial work so unfaithfully executed, because it is
   so carnally undertaken; men enter upon it as a life of ease, and honor,
   and respectability, and they resolve to attain their ends, and have
   what they expected by right or wrong. They looked not for hatred and
   suffering, and they will avoid it, though by the avoiding of their
   work.

   [b] As for the making yourselves incapable of doing them good, I
   answer, That reason is as valid against plain preaching, reproof, or
   any other duty which wicked men will hate us for. God will bless his
   own ordinances to do good, or else he would not have appointed them. If
   you publicly admonish and rebuke the scandalous, and call them to
   repentance, and cast out the obstinate, you may do good to many whom
   you reprove, and possibly to the excommunicated themselves. I am at
   least sure it is God's means; and it is his last means when reproofs
   will do no good. It is therefore perverse to neglect the last means,
   lest we frustrate the foregoing means, when the last are not to be used
   but upon supposition that the former were all frustrated before.
   However, those within and those without may receive good by it, if the
   offender should receive none; and God will have the honor, when his
   Church is manifestly distinguished from the world, and the heirs of
   heaven and hell are not totally confounded, nor the world made to think
   that Christ and Satan do but contend for superiority, and that they
   have the like inclination to holiness or to sin.

   [c] But yet let me tell you, that there are not such difficulties in
   the way, nor is discipline such a useless thing as you imagine. I bless
   God upon the small and too late trial which I have made of it myself. I
   can speak by experience, that it is not in vain; nor are the hazards of
   it such as may excuse our neglect.

   I confess, if I had my will, that man should be ejected as a negligent
   pastor, that will not rule his people by discipline, as well as he is
   ejected as a negligent preacher that will not preach; for ruling I am
   sure is as essential a part of the pastor's office as preaching.

   I shall proceed no further in these confessions. And now, brethren,
   what remaineth, but that we all cry guilty of these forementioned sins,
   and humble our souls for our miscarriages before the Lord? Is this
   taking heed to ourselves and to all the flock?' Is this like the
   pattern that is given us in the text? If we should now prove
   stout-hearted and unhumbled, how sad a symptom would it be to
   ourselves, and to the Church! The ministry hath oft been threatened and
   maligned by many sorts of adversaries; and though this may show their
   impious malice, yet may it also intimate to us God's just indignation.
   Believe it, brethren, the ministry of England are not the least nor the
   last in the sins of the land. It is time, therefore, for us to take our
   part of that humiliation to which we have been so long calling our
   people. If we have our wits about us, we may perceive that God hath
   been offended with us, and that the voice that called this nation to
   repentance, did speak to us as well others. He that hath ears to hear,
   let him hear' the precepts of repentance proclaimed in so many
   admirable deliverances and preservations; he that hath eyes to see, let
   him see them written in so many lines of blood. By fire and sword hath
   God been calling us to humiliation; and as judgment hath begun at the
   house of God,' so, if humiliation begin not there too, it will be a sad
   prognostication to us and to the land.

   What! shall we deny or extenuate our sins while we call our people to
   free and full confession? Is it not better to give glory to God by
   humble confession, than, in tenderness to ourselves, to seek for
   fig-leaves to cover our nakedness; and to put God to it to build his
   glory, which we denied him, upon the ruins of our own, which we
   preferred before him; and to distrain for that by yet sorer judgments
   which we refused voluntarily to surrender to him? Alas! if you put God
   to get his honor as he can, he may get it, to your everlasting sorrow
   and dishonor. Sins openly committed, are more dishonorable to us when
   we hide them, than when we confess them. It is the sin, and not the
   confession, that is our dishonor. We have committed them before the
   sun, so that they cannot be hid; and attempts to cloak them do but
   increase our guilt and shame. There is no way to repair the breaches in
   our honor, which our sin hath made, but by free confession and
   humiliation. I durst not but make confession of my own sins: and if any
   be offended that I have confessed theirs, let them know, that I do but
   what I have done by myself. And if they dare disown the confession of
   their sin, let them do it at their peril. But as for all the truly
   humble ministers of Christ, I doubt not but they will rather be
   provoked to lament their sins more solemnly in the face of their
   several congregations, and to promise reformation.

  SECTION 2 - THE DUTY OF PERSONAL CATECHIZING AND INSTRUCTING THE FLOCK
  PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED

   Having disclosed and lamented our miscarriages and neglects, our duty
   for the future lies plain before us. God forbid that we should now go
   on in the sins which we have confessed, as carelessly as we did before.
   Leaving these things, therefore, I shall now proceed to exhort you to
   the faithful discharge of the great duty which you have undertaken,
   namely, personal catechising and instructing every one in your parishes
   or congregations that will submit thereto.

   First, I shall state to you some motives to persuade you to this duty.

   Secondly, I shall answer some objections which may be made to this
   duty. Lastly, I shall give you some directions for performing this
   duty.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PART I

  MOTIVES TO THIS DUTY

   Agreeably to this plan, I shall proceed to state to you some motives to
   persuade you to this duty. The first reasons by which I shall persuade
   you to this duty, are taken from the benefits of it: The second, from
   its difficulty: And the third, from its necessity, and the many
   obligations that are upon us for the performance of it.

  ARTICLE I

  MOTIVES FROM THE BENEFITS OF THE WORK

   When I look before me, and consider what, through the blessing of God,
   this work, if well managed, is like to effect, it makes my heart leap
   for joy. Truly, brethren, you have begun a most blessed work, and such
   as your own consciences may rejoice in, and your parishes rejoice in,
   and the nation rejoice in, and the child that is yet unborn rejoice in.
   Yea, thousands and millions, for aught we know, may have cause to bless
   God for it, when we shall have finished our course. And though it is
   our business this day to humble ourselves for the neglect of it so
   long, as we have very great cause to do, yet the hopes of a blessed
   success are so great in me, that they are ready to turn it into a day
   of rejoicing.

   I bless the Lord that I have lived to see such a day as this, and to be
   present at so solemn an engagement of so many servants of Christ to
   such a work. I bless the Lord, that hath honored you of this county to
   be the beginners and awakeners of the nation to this duty. It is not a
   controverted point, as to which the exasperated minds of men might pick
   quarrels with us, nor is it a new invention, as to which envy might
   charge you as innovators, or pride might scorn to follow, because you
   had led the way. No; it is a well-known duty. It is but the more
   diligent and effectual management of the ministerial work. It is not a
   new invention, but simply the restoration of the ancient ministerial
   work. And because it is so pregnant with advantages to the Church, I
   will enumerate some of the particular benefits which we may hope to
   result from it, that when you see the excellency of it, you may be the
   more set upon it, and the more loath, by any negligence or failing of
   yours, to frustrate or destroy it. For certainly he who hath the true
   intentions of a minister of Christ will rejoice in the appearance of
   any further hope of attaining the ends of his ministry; and nothing
   will be more welcome to him than that which will further the very
   business of his life. That this work is calculated to accomplish this,
   I shall now show you more particularly.

   1. It will be a most hopeful means of the conversion of souls; for it
   unites those great things which most further such an end.

   (1) As to the matter of it; it is about the most necessary things, the
   principles or essentials of the Christian faith.

   (2) As to the manner of it: it will be by private conference, when we
   may have an opportunity to set all home to the conscience and the
   heart.

   The work of conversion consisteth of two parts: First, the informing of
   the judgment in the essential principles of religion; Second, The
   change of the will by the efficacy of the truth. Now in this work we
   have the most excellent advantages for both. For the informing of their
   understandings, it must needs be an excellent help to have the sum of
   Christianity fixed in their memory. And though bare words, not
   understood, will make no change, yet, when the words are plain English,
   he that hath the words is far more likely to understand the meaning and
   matter than another. For what have we by which to make known things
   which are themselves invisible, but words or other signs? Those,
   therefore, who deride all catechisms as unprofitable forms, may better
   deride themselves for talking and using the form of their own words to
   make known their minds to others. Why may not written words, which are
   constantly before their eyes, and in their memories, instruct them, as
   well as the transient words of a preacher? These forms of sound words'
   are, therefore, so far from being unprofitable, as some persons
   imagine, that they are of admirable use to all. Besides, we shall have
   the opportunity, by personal conference, to try how far they understand
   the catechism, and to explain it to them as we go along; and to insist
   on those particulars which the persons we speak to have most need to
   hear. These two conjoined -- a form of sound words, with a plain
   explication -- may do more than either of them could do alone.

   Moreover, we shall have the best opportunity to impress the truth upon
   their hearts, when we can speak to each individual's particular
   necessity, and say to the sinner, Thou art the man,' and plainly
   mention his particular case; and set home the truth with familiar
   importunity. If any thing in the world is likely to do them good, it is
   this. They will understand a familiar speech, who understand not a
   sermon; and they will have far greater help for the application of it
   to themselves. Besides, you will hear their objections, and know where
   it is that Satan hath most advantage of them, and so may be able to
   show them their errors, and confute their objections, and more
   effectually convince them. We can better bring them to the point, and
   urge them to discover their resolutions for the future, and to promise
   the use of means and reformation, than otherwise we could do. What more
   proof need we of this, than our own experience? I seldom deal with men
   purposely on this great business, in private, serious conference, but
   they go away with some seeming convictions, and promises of new
   obedience, if not some deeper remorse, and sense of their condition.

   O brethren, what a blow may we give to the kingdom of darkness, by the
   faithful and skillful managing of this work! If, then, the saving of
   souls, of your neighbours' souls, of many souls, from everlasting
   misery, be worth your labor, up and be doing! If you would be the
   fathers of many that are born again, and would see of the travail of
   your souls,' and would be able to say at last, Here am I, and the
   children whom thou hast given me' -- up and ply this blessed work! If
   it would do your heart good to see your converts among the saints in
   glory, and praising the Lamb before the throne; if it would rejoice you
   to present them blameless and spotless to Christ, prosecute with
   diligence and ardor this singular opportunity that is offered you. If
   you are ministers of Christ indeed, you will long for the perfecting of
   his body, and the gathering in of his elect; and you will travail as in
   birth' till Christ be formed in the souls of your people. You will
   embrace such opportunities as your harvest-time affords, and as the
   sunshine days in a rainy harvest, in which it is unreasonable and
   inexcusable to be idle. If you have a spark of Christian compassion in
   you, it will surely seem worth your utmost labor to save so many souls
   from death, and to cover' so great a multitude of sins.' If, then, you
   are indeed fellow-workers with Christ, set to his work, and neglect not
   the souls for whom he died. O remember, when you are talking with the
   unconverted, that now you have an opportunity to save a soul, and to
   rejoice the angels of heaven, and to rejoice Christ himself, to cast
   Satan out of a sinner, and to increase the family of God! And what is
   your hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?' Is it not your saved people
   in the presence of Christ Jesus at his coming?' Yes, doubtless they are
   your glory and your joy.'

   2. It will essentially promote the orderly building up of those who are
   converted, and the establishment of them in the faith. It hazardeth our
   whole work, or at least much hindereth it, if we do it not in the
   proper order. How can you build, if you first not lay a good foundation
   or how can you set on the top-stone, while the middle parts are
   neglected? Grace makes no leaps,' any more than nature. The second
   order of Christian truths have such a dependence upon the first, that
   they can never be well learned till the first are learned. This makes
   many labor so much in vain; they are ever learning, but never come to
   the knowledge of the truth,' because they would read before they learn
   to spell, or to know their letters. This makes so many fall away: they
   are shaken with every wind of temptation, because they were not well
   settled in the fundamental principles of religion. It is these
   fundamentals that must lead men to further truths; it is these they
   must build all upon; it is these that must actuate all their graces,
   and animate all their duties; it is these that must fortify them
   against temptations. He that knows not these, knows nothing; he that
   knows them well, doth know so much as will make him happy; and he that
   knows them best, is the best and most understanding Christian. The most
   godly people, therefore, in your congregations, will find it worth
   their labor to learn the very words of a catechism. If, then, you would
   safely edify them, and firmly establish them, be diligent in this work.

   3. It will make our public preaching better understood and regarded.
   When you have instructed them in the principles, they will the better
   understand all you say. They will perceive what you drive at, when they
   are once acquainted with the main points. This prepareth their minds,
   and openeth a way to their hearts; whereas, without this, you may lose
   the most of your labor; and the more pains you take in accurate
   preparation, the less good you may do. As you would not, therefore,
   lose your public labor, see that you be faithful in this private work.

   4. By means of it, you will come to be familiar with your people, and
   may thereby win their affections. The want of this, with those who have
   very numerous congregations, is a great impediment to the success of
   our labors. By distance and unacquaintedness, abundance of mistakes
   between ministers and people are fomented; while, on the other hand,
   familiarity will tend to beget those affections which may open their
   ears to further instruction. Besides, when we are familiar with them,
   they will be encouraged to open their doubts to us and deal freely with
   us. But when a minister knows not his people, or is as strange to them
   as if he did not know them, it must be a great hindrance to his doing
   any good among them.

   5. By means of it, we shall come to be better acquainted with each
   person's spiritual state, and so the better know how to watch over
   them. We shall know better how to preach to them, and carry ourselves
   to them, when we know their temper, and their chief objections, and so
   what they have most need to hear. We shall know better wherein to be
   jealous over them with a godly jealousy,' and what temptations to guard
   them most against. We shall know better how to lament for them, and to
   rejoice with them, and to pray for them. For as he that will pray
   rightly for himself must know his own wants, and the diseases of his
   own heart, so he that will pray rightly for others, should know theirs
   as far as possible.

   6. By means of this trial and acquaintance with our people's state we
   shall be much assisted in the admission of them to the sacraments.
   Though I doubt not a minister may require his people to come to him at
   any convenient season, to give an account of their faith and
   proficiency, and to receive instruction, and therefore he may do it as
   a preparation for the Lord's supper, yet because ministers have laid
   the stress of that examination upon the mere necessity of fitness for
   that ordinance, and not upon their common duty to see the state and
   proficiency of each member of their flock at all fit seasons, and upon
   the people's duty to submit to the guidance and instruction of their
   pastors at all times, they have occasioned people ignorantly to quarrel
   with their examinations. Now, by this course we shall discover their
   fitness or unfitness, in a way that is unexceptionable; and in a way
   far more effectual than by some partial examination of them before they
   are admitted to the Lord's table.

   7. It will show men the true nature of the ministerial office, and
   awaken them to the better consideration of it, than is now usual. It is
   too common for men to think that the work of the ministry is nothing
   but to preach, and to baptize, and to administer the Lord's supper, and
   to visit the sick. By this means the people will submit to no more; and
   too many ministers are such strangers to their own calling, that they
   will do no more. It hath oft grieved my heart to observe some eminent
   able preachers, how little they do for the saving of souls, save only
   in the pulpit; and to how little purpose much of their labor is, by
   this neglect. They have hundreds of people that they never spoke a word
   to personally for their salvation; and if we may judge by their
   practice, they consider it not as their duty; and the principal thing
   that hardeneth men in this oversight is the common neglect of the
   private part of the work by others. There are so few that do much in
   it, and the omission hath grown so common among pious, able men, that
   the disgrace of it is abated by their ability; and a man may now be
   guilty of it without any particular notice or dishonor. Never doth sin
   so reign in a church or state, as when it hath gained reputation, or,
   at least, is no disgrace to the sinner, nor a matter of offense to
   beholders. But I make no doubt, through the mercy of God, that the
   restoring of the practice of personal oversight will convince many
   ministers, that this is as truly their work as that which they now do,
   and may awaken them to see that the ministry is another kind of
   business than too many excellent preachers take it to be. Brethren, do
   but set yourselves closely to this work, and follow it diligently; and
   though you do it silently, without any words to them that are
   negligent, I am in hope that most of you who are present may live to
   see the day, when the neglect of private personal oversight of all the
   flock shall be taken for a scandalous and odious omission, and shall be
   as disgraceful to them that are guilty of it, as preaching but once a
   day was heretofore. A schoolmaster must take a personal account of his
   scholars, or else he is like to do little good. If physicians should
   only read a public lecture on physic, their patients would not be much
   the better of them; nor would a lawyer secure your estate by reading a
   lecture on law. Now, the charge of a pastor requireth personal dealing,
   as well as any of these. Let us show the world this by our practice;
   for most men are grown regardless of bare words.

   The truth is, we have been led to wrong the Church exceedingly in this
   respect, by the contrary extreme of the Papists, who bring all their
   people to auricular confession; for, in overthrowing this error of
   theirs, we have run into the opposite extreme, and have led our people
   much further into it than we have gone ourselves. It troubled me much
   to read, in an orthodox historian, that licentiousness, and a desire to
   be from under the strict inquiries of the priests in confession, did
   much further the entertainment of the reformed religion in Germany. And
   yet it is like enough to be true, that they who were against
   reformation in other respects, might, on this account, join with better
   men in crying down the Romish clergy. I have no doubt that the Popish
   auricular confession is a sinful novelty, which the ancient Church was
   unacquainted with. But, perhaps, some will think it strange that I
   should say, that our common neglect of personal instruction is much
   worse, if we consider their confessions in themselves, and not as they
   respect their linked doctrines of satisfaction and purgatory. If any
   among us should be guilty of so gross a mistake, as to think that, when
   he hath preached, he hath done all his work, let us show him, by our
   practice of the rest, that there is much more to be done; and that
   taking heed to all the flock,' is another business than careless, lazy
   ministers imagine. If a man have an apprehension that duty, and the
   chiefest duty, is no duty, he is like to neglect it, and to be
   impenitent in the neglect.

   8. It will help our people better to understand the nature of their
   duty toward their overseers, and, consequently, to discharge it better.
   This, indeed, were a matter of no consequence, if it were only for our
   sakes; but their own salvation is much concerned in it. I am convinced,
   by sad experience, that it is none of the least impediments to their
   salvation, and to a true reformation of the Church, that the people
   understand not what the work of a minister is, and what is their own
   duty towards him. They commonly think, that a minister hath no more to
   do with them, but to preach to them, and administer the sacraments to
   them, and visit them in sickness; and that, if they hear him, and
   receive the sacraments from him, they owe him no further obedience, nor
   can he require any more at their hands. Little do they know that the
   minister is in the church, as the schoolmaster in his school, to teach,
   and take an account of every one in particular; and that all
   Christians, ordinarily, must be disciples or scholars in some such
   school. They think not that a minister is in the church, as a physician
   in a town, for all people to resort to, for personal advice for the
   curing of all their diseases; and that the priest's lips should keep
   knowledge, and the people should ask the law at his mouth, because he
   is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.' They consider not, that all
   souls in the congregation are bound, for their own safety, to have
   personal recourse to him, for the resolving of their doubts, and for
   help against their sins, and for direction in duty, and for increase of
   knowledge and all saving grace; and that ministers are purposely
   settled in congregations to this end, to be still ready to advise and
   help the flock.

   If our people did but know their duty, they would readily come to us,
   when they are desired, to be instructed, and to give an account of
   their knowledge, faith, and life; and they would come of their own
   accord, without being sent for; and knock oftener at our doors; and
   call for advice and help for their souls; and ask, What shall we do to
   be saved?' Whereas now the matter is come to that sad pass, that they
   think a minister hath nothing to do with them: and if he admonish them,
   or if he call them to be catechized and instructed; or if he would take
   an account of their faith and profiting, they would ask him by what
   authority he doth these things? and think that he is a busy,
   pragmatical fellow, who loves to be meddling where he hath nothing to
   do; or a proud fellow, who would bear rule over their consciences;
   whereas they may as well ask, by what authority he preacheth, or
   prayeth, or giveth them the sacrament They consider not, that all our
   authority is but for our work; even a power to do our duty; and that
   our work is for them: so that it is but an authority to do them good.
   They talk not more wisely, than if they should quarrel with a man who
   would help to quench a fire in their houses, and ask him, by what
   authority he doth it? Or that would give money to relieve the poor, and
   they should ask him, By what authority do you require us to take this
   money? Or as if I offered my hand to one that is fallen, to help him
   up, or to one that is in the water, to save him from drowning, and he
   should ask me by what authority I do it? And what is it that hath
   brought our people to this ignorance of their duty, but custom? It is
   we, brethren, to speak truly and plainly, who are to blame, that have
   not accustomed them and ourselves to any more than common public work.
   We see how much custom doth with the people. Where it is the custom, as
   among the Papists, they hesitate not to confess all their sins to the
   priest; but, among us, they disdain to be catechized or instructed,
   because it is not the custom. They wonder at it, as a strange thing,
   and say, Such things were never done before. And if we can but prevail
   to make this duty as common as other duties, they will much more easily
   submit to it than now. What a happy thing would it be, if you might
   live to see the day, that it should be as ordinary for people of all
   ages to come in course to their ministers for personal advice and help
   for their salvation, as it is now usual for them to come to the church
   to hear a sermon, or receive the sacrament! Our diligence in this work,
   is the way to bring this about.

   9. It will give the governors of the nation more correct views about
   the nature and burden of the ministry, and so may procure from them
   further assistance. It is a lamentable impediment to the reformation of
   the Church, and the saving of souls, that, in most populous towns,
   there are but one or two men to oversee many thousand souls, and so
   there are not laborers in any degree equal to the work; but it becomes
   an impossible thing for them to do any considerable measure of that
   personal duty which should be done by faithful pastors to all the
   flock. I have often said it, and still must say it, that this is a
   great part of England's misery, that a great degree of spiritual famine
   reigns in most cities and large towns throughout the land, even where
   they are insensible of it, and think themselves well provided. Alas! we
   see multitudes of ignorant, carnal, sensual sinners around us -- here a
   family, and there a family, and there almost a whole street or village
   of them -- and our hearts pity them, and we see that their necessities
   cry loud for our speedy and diligent relief, so that he that hath ears
   to hear' must needs hear. Yet if we were never so fain, we cannot help
   them: and that not merely through their obstinacy, but also through our
   want of opportunity. We have found by experience, that if we could but
   have leisure to speak to them, and to open plainly to them their sin
   and danger, there were great hopes of doing good to many of them, that
   receive little by our public teaching. But we cannot come at them; more
   necessary work prohibits us: we cannot do both at once; and our public
   work must be preferred, because there we deal with many at once. And it
   is as much as we are able to do, to perform the public work, or some
   little more; and if we do take the time when we should eat or sleep,
   (besides the ruining of weakened bodies by it,) we shall not be able,
   after all, to speak to one of very many of them. So that we must stand
   by and see poor people perish, and can but be sorry for them, and
   cannot so much as speak to them to endeavor their recovery. Is not this
   a sad case in a nation that glorieth of the fullness of the gospel? An
   infidel will say, No: but, methinks, no man that believes an
   everlasting joy or torment should give such an answer.

   I will give you the instance of my own case. We are together two
   ministers, and a third at a chapel, willing to spend every hour of our
   time in Christ's work. Before we undertook this work, our hands were
   full, and now we are engaged to set apart two days every week, from
   morning to night, for private catechizing and instruction; so that any
   man may see that we must leave undone all that other work that we were
   wont to do at that time: and we are necessitated to run upon the public
   work of preaching with small preparation, and so must deliver the
   message of God so rawly and confusedly, and unanswerably to its dignity
   and the need of men's souls, that it is a great trouble to our minds to
   consider it, and a greater trouble to us when we are doing it. And yet
   it must be so; there is no remedy: unless we will omit this personal
   instruction, we must needs run thus unpreparedly into the pulpit. And
   to omit this we dare not -- it is so great and necessary a work. And
   when we have incurred all the forementioned inconveniences, and have
   set apart two whole days a week for this work, it will be as much as we
   shall be able to do, to go over the parish once in a year, (being about
   800 families,) and which is worse than that, we shall be forced to cut
   it short, and do it less effectually to those that we do it, having
   above fifteen families a week to deal with. And, alas! how small a
   matter is it to speak to a man only once in a year, and that so
   cursorily as we must be forced to do, in comparison of what their
   necessities require. Yet are we in hope of some fruit of this much; but
   how much more might it be, if we could but speak to them once a
   quarter, and do the work more fully and deliberately, as you that are
   in smaller parishes may do. And many ministers in England have ten
   times the number of parishioners which I have: so that if they should
   undertake the work which we have undertaken, they can go over the
   parish but once in ten years. So that while we are hoping for
   opportunities to speak to them, we hear of one dying after another, and
   to the grief of our souls, are forced to go with them to their graves,
   before we could ever speak a word to them personally to prepare them
   for their change. And what is the cause of all this misery? Why, our
   rulers have not seen the necessity of any more than one or two
   ministers in such parishes; and so they have not allowed any
   maintenance to that end. Some have alienated much from the Church, (the
   Lord humble all them that consented to it, lest it prove the
   consumption of the nation at last,) while they have left this famine in
   the chief parts of the land. It is easy to separate from the multitude,
   and to gather distinct churches, and to let the rest sink or swim; and
   if they will not be saved by public preaching, to let them be damned:
   but whether this be the most charitable and Christian course, one would
   think should be no hard question.

   But what is the matter that wise and godly rulers should be thus guilty
   of our misery, and that none of our cries will awaken them to
   compassion? What! are they so ignorant as not to know these things? Or
   are they grown cruel to the souls of men? Or are they false-hearted to
   the interest of Christ, and have a design to undermine his kingdom? No,
   I hope it is none of these; but, for aught I can find, it is we who are
   to blame, even we, the ministers of the gospel, whom they should thus
   maintain. For those ministers that have small parishes, and might do
   all this private part of the work, yet do it not, or at least few of
   them. And those in great towns and cities, that might do somewhat,
   though they cannot do all, will do just nothing but what accidentally
   falls in their way, or next to nothing; so that the magistrate is not
   awakened to the observance or consideration of the weight of our work.
   Or if they do apprehend the usefulness of it, yet if they see that
   ministers are so careless and lazy, that they will not do it, they
   think it in vain to provide them a maintenance for it -- it would be
   but to cherish idle drones -- and so they think, that if they maintain
   ministers enough to preach in the pulpit, they have done their part.
   And thus are they involved in heinous sin, and we are the occasion of
   it. Whereas, if we do but all heartily set ourselves to this work, and
   show the magistrate to his face, that it is a most weighty and
   necessary part of our business; and that we would do it thoroughly if
   we could; and that if there were hands enough, the work might go on:
   and, withal, when he shall see the happy success of our labors, then,
   no doubt, if the fear of God be in them, and they have any love to his
   truth and men's souls, they will set to their helping hand, and not let
   men perish because there is no man to speak to them to prevent it. They
   will one way or other raise maintenance in such populous places for
   laborers, proportioned to the number of souls, and greatness of the
   work. Let them but see us fall to the work, and behold it prosper in
   our hands; as, if it be well managed, there is no doubt it will,
   through God's blessing, and then their hearts will be drawn out to the
   promoting of it: and, instead of laying parishes together to diminish
   the number of teachers, they will either divide them, or allow more
   teachers to a parish. But when they see that many carnal ministers do
   make a greater stir to have more maintenance to themselves, than to
   have more help in the work of God, they are tempted by such worldlings
   to wrong the Church, that particular ministers may have ease and
   fullness.

   10. It will exceedingly facilitate the ministerial work in succeeding
   generations. Custom, as I said before, is the thing that sways much
   with the multitude; and they who first break a destructive custom, must
   bear the brunt of their indignation. Now, somebody must do this. If we
   do it not, it will lie upon our successors; and how can we expect that
   they will be more hardy, and resolute, and faithful than we? It is we
   that have seen the heavy judgments of the Lord, and heard him pleading
   by fire and sword with the land. It is we that have been ourselves in
   the furnace, and should be the most refined. It is we that are most
   deeply obliged by oaths and covenants, by wonderful deliverances,
   experiences, and mercies of all sorts. And if we yet flinch and turn
   our backs, and prove false-hearted, why should we expect better from
   them, that have not been driven by such scourges as we, nor drawn by
   such cords? But, if they do prove better than we, the same odium and
   opposition must befall them which we avoid, and that with some
   increase, because of our neglect; for the people will tell them that
   we, their predecessors did no such things. But if we would now break
   the ice for them that follow us, their souls will bless us, and our
   names will be dear to them, and they will feel the happy fruits of our
   labor every day of their ministry; when the people shall willingly
   submit to their private instructions and examinations, yea, and to
   discipline too, because we have acquainted them with it, and removed
   the prejudice, and broken the evil custom which our predecessors had
   been the cause of. Thus we may do much to the saving of many thousand
   souls, in all ages to come, as well as in the present age in which we
   live.

   11. It will much conduce to the better ordering of families, and the
   better spending of the Sabbath. When we have once got the masters of
   families to undertake that they will, every Lord's day, examine their
   children and servants, and make them repeat some catechism and passages
   of Scripture, this will find them most profitable employment; whereas
   many of them would otherwise be idle or ill-employed. Many masters, who
   know little themselves, may yet be brought to do this for others, and
   in this way they may even teach themselves.

   12. It will do good to many ministers, who are too apt to be idle, and
   to mis-spend their time in unnecessary discourse, business, journeys,
   or recreations. It will let them see that they have no time to spare
   for such things; and thus, when they are engaged in so much pressing
   employment of so high a nature, it will be the best cure for all that
   idleness, and loss of time. Besides, it will cut off that scandal,
   which usually followeth thereupon; for people are apt to say, Such a
   minister can spend his time at bowls, or other sports, or vain
   discourse; and why may not we do so as well as he? Let us all set
   diligently to this part of our work, and then see what time we can find
   to spare to live idly, or in a way of voluptuousness, or worldliness,
   if we can.

   13. It will be productive of many personal benefits to ourselves. It
   will do much to subdue our own corruptions, and to exercise and
   increase our own graces. It will afford much peace to our consciences,
   and comfort us when our past lives come to be reviewed.

   To be much in provoking others to repentance and heavenly-mindedness
   may do much to excite them in ourselves. To cry down the sin of others,
   and engage them against it, and direct them to overcome it, will do
   much to shame us out of our own; and conscience will scarcely suffer us
   to live in that which we make so much ado to draw others from. Even our
   constant employment for God, and busying our minds and tongues against
   sin, and for Christ and holiness, will do much to overcome our fleshly
   inclinations, both by direct mortification, and by diversion, leaving
   our fancies no room nor time for their old employment. All the
   austerities of monks and hermits, who addict themselves to unprofitable
   solitude, and who think to save themselves by neglecting to show
   compassion to others, will not do near so much in the true work of
   mortification, as this fruitful diligence for Christ.

   14. It will be some benefit, that by this means we shall take off
   ourselves and our people from vain controversies, and from expending
   our care and zeal on the lesser matters of religion, which least tend
   to their spiritual edification. While we are taken up in teaching, and
   they in learning the fundamental truths of the gospel, we shall divert
   our minds and tongues, and have less room for lower things; and so it
   will cure much wranglings and contentions between ministers and people.
   For we do that which we need not and should not, because we will not
   fall diligently to do that which we need and should.

   15. And then for the extent of the aforesaid benefits: The design of
   this work is, the reforming and saving of all the people in our several
   parishes. For we shall not leave out any man that will submit to be
   instructed; and though we can scarcely hope that every individual will
   be reformed and saved by it, yet have we reason to hope, that as the
   attempt is universal, so the success will be more general and extensive
   than we have hitherto seen of our other labors. Sure I am, it is most
   like to the spirit, and precept, and offers of the gospel, which
   requireth us to preach Christ to every creature, and promiseth life to
   every man, if he will accept it by believing. If God would have all men
   to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, (that is, as
   Rector and Benefactor of the world, he hath manifested himself willing
   to save all men, if they be willing themselves, though his elect he
   will also make willing,) then surely it beseems us to offer salvation
   unto all men, and to endeavor to bring them to the knowledge of the
   truth. And, if Christ tasted death for every man,' it is meet we should
   preach his death to every man. This work hath a more excellent design,
   than our accidental conferences with now and then a particular person.
   And I have observed, that in such occasional discourses men satisfy
   themselves with having spoken some good words, but seldom set plainly
   and closely home the matter, to convince men of sin and misery and
   mercy; as in this purposely appointed work we are more like to do.

   16. It is like to be a work that will reach over the whole land, and
   not stop with us that have now engaged in it. For though it be at
   present neglected, I suppose the cause is the same with our brethren as
   it hath been with us, namely, that inconsiderateness and laziness,
   which we are here bewailing this day, but especially, despair of the
   submission of the people to it. But when they shall be reminded of so
   clear and great a duty, and shall see the practicability of it, in a
   good measure, when it is done by common consent, they will, no doubt,
   universally take it up, and gladly concur with us in so blessed a work;
   for they are the servants of the same God, as sensible of the interests
   of Christ, and as compassionate to men's souls; as conscientious, and
   as self-denying, and ready to do or suffer for such excellent ends as
   we are. Seeing, therefore, they have the same spirit, rule, and Lord, I
   will not be so uncharitable as to doubt, whether all that are godly
   throughout the land (or at least the generality of them,) will gladly
   join with us. And oh, what a happy thing it will be to see such a
   general combination for Christ; and to see all England so seriously
   called upon, and importuned for Christ, and set in so fair a way to
   heaven! Methinks the consideration of it should make our hearts rejoice
   within us, to see so many faithful servants of Christ all over the
   land, addressing every particular sinner with such importunity, as men
   that will hardly take a denial. Methinks I even see all the godly
   ministers of England commencing the work already, and resolving to
   embrace the present opportunity, that unanimity may facilitate it.

   17. Lastly, Of so great weight and excellency is the duty which we are
   now recommending, that the chief part of Church reformation that is
   behind as to means consisteth in it; and it must be the chief means to
   answer the judgments, the mercies, the prayers, the promises, the cost,
   the endeavors, and the blood of the nation; and without this it will
   not be done; the ends of all these will never be well attained; a
   reformation to purpose will never be wrought; the Church will be still
   low; the interest of Christ will be much neglected; and God will still
   have a controversy with the land, and, above all, with the ministry
   that have been deepest in the guilt.

   How long have we talked of reformation, how much have we said and done
   for it in general, and how deeply and devoutly have we vowed it for our
   own parts; and, after all this, how shamefully have we neglected it,
   and neglect it to this day! We carry ourselves as if we had not known
   or considered what that reformation was which we vowed. As carnal men
   will take on them to be Christians, and profess with confidence that
   they believe in Christ, and accept of his salvation, and may contend
   for Christ, and fight for him, and yet, for all this, will have none of
   him, but perish for refusing him, who little dreamed that ever they had
   been refusers of him; and all because they understood not what his
   salvation is, and how it is carried on, but dream of a salvation
   without flesh-displeasing, and without self-denial and renouncing the
   world, and parting with their sins, and without any holiness, or any
   great pains and labor of their own in subserviency to Christ and the
   Spirit: even so did too many ministers and private men talk and write,
   and pray, and fight, and long for reformation, and would little have
   believed that man who should have presumed to tell them, that,
   notwithstanding all this, their very hearts were against reformation;
   and that they who were praying for it, and fasting for it, and wading
   through blood for it, would never accept it, but would themselves be
   the rejectors and destroyers of it. And yet so it is, and so it hath
   too plainly proved: and whence is all this strange deceit of heart,
   that good men should no better know themselves? Why, the case is plain;
   they thought of a reformation to be given by God, but not of a
   reformation to be wrought on and by themselves. They considered the
   blessing, but never thought of the means of accomplishing it. But as if
   they had expected that all things besides themselves should be mended
   without them, or that the Holy Ghost should again descend miraculously,
   or every sermon should convert its thousands, or that some angel from
   heaven or some Elias should be sent to restore all things, or that the
   law of the parliament, and the sword of the magistrate, would have
   converted or constrained all, and have done the deed; and little did
   they think of a reformation that must be wrought by their own diligence
   and unwearied labors, by earnest preaching and catechizing, and
   personal instructions, and taking heed to all the flock, whatever pains
   or reproaches it should cost them. They thought not that a thorough
   reformation would multiply their own work; but we had all of us too
   carnal thoughts, that when we had ungodly men at our mercy, all would
   be done, and conquering them was converting them, or such a means as
   would have frightened them to heaven. But the business is far
   otherwise, and had we then known how a reformation must be attained,
   perhaps some would have been colder in the prosecution of it. And yet I
   know that even foreseen labors seem small matters at a distance, while
   we do but hear and talk of them; but when we come nearer them, and must
   lay our hands to the work, and put on our armor, and charge through the
   thickest of opposing difficulties, then is the sincerity and the
   strength of men's hearts brought to trial, and it will appear how they
   purposed and promised before.

   Reformation is to many of us, as the Messiah was to the Jews. Before he
   came, they looked and longed for him, and boasted of him, and rejoiced
   in hope of him; but when he came they could not abide him, but hated
   him, and would not believe that he was indeed the person, and therefore
   persecuted and put him to death, to the curse and confusion of the main
   body of their nation. The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to
   his temple, even the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in. But
   who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he
   appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap: and
   he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify
   the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may
   offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.' And the reason was,
   because it was another manner of Christ that the Jews expected; it was
   one who would bring them riches and liberty, and to this day they
   profess that they will never believe in any but such. So it is with too
   many about reformation. They hoped for a reformation, that would bring
   them more wealth and honor with the people, and power to force men to
   do what they would have them: and now they see a reformation, that must
   put them to more condescension and pains than they were ever at before.
   They thought of having the opposers of godliness under their feet, but
   now they see they must go to them with humble entreaties, and put their
   hands under their feet, if they would do them good, and meekly beseech
   even those that sometime sought their lives, and make it now their
   daily business to overcome them by kindness, and win them with love. O
   how many carnal expectations are here crossed!

  ARTICLE 2

  MOTIVES FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE WORK

   Having stated to you the first class of reasons, drawn from the
   benefits of the work, I come to the second sort, which are taken from
   the difficulties. If these, indeed, were taken alone, I confess they
   might be rather discouragements than motives; but taking them with
   those that go before and follow, the case is far otherwise: for
   difficulties must excite to greater diligence in a necessary work.

   And difficulties we shall find many, both in ourselves and in our
   people; but because they are things so obvious, that your experience
   will leave you no room to doubt of them, I shall pass them over in a
   few words.

   1. Let me notice the difficulties in ourselves.

   (1) In ourselves there is much dulness and laziness, so that it will
   not be easy to get us to be faithful in so hard a work. Like a sluggard
   in bed, that knows he should rise, and yet delayeth and would lie as
   long as he can, so do we by duties to which our corrupt natures are
   averse. This will put us to the use of all our powers. Mere sloth will
   tie the hands of many.

   (2) We have a base man-pleasing disposition, which will make us let men
   perish lest we lose their love, and let them go quietly to hell, lest
   we should make them angry with us for seeking their salvation: and we
   are ready to venture on the displeasure of God, and risk the
   everlasting misery of our people, rather than draw on ourselves their
   ill-will. This distemper must be diligently resisted.

   (3) Many of us have also a foolish bashfulness, which makes us backward
   to begin with them, and to speak plainly to them. We are so modest,
   forsooth, that we blush to speak for Christ, or to contradict the
   devil, or to save a soul, while, at the same time, we are less ashamed
   of shameful works.

   (4) We are so carnal that we are drawn by our fleshly interests to be
   unfaithful in the work of Christ, lest we should lessen our income, or
   bring trouble upon ourselves, or set people against us, or such like.
   All these things require diligence in order to resist them.

   (5) We are so weak in the faith, that this is the greatest impediment
   of all. Hence it is, that when we should set upon a man for his
   conversion with all our might, if there be not the stirrings of
   unbelief within us, whether there be a heaven and a hell, yet at least
   the belief of them is so feeble, that it will hardly excite in us a
   kindly, resolute, constant zeal, so that our whole motion will be but
   weak, because the spring of faith is so weak. O what need, therefore,
   have ministers for themselves and their work, to look well to their
   faith, especially that their assent to the truth of Scripture, about
   the joys and torments of the life to come, be sound and lively.

   (6) Lastly, We have commonly a great deal of unskilfulness and
   unfitness for this work. Alas! how few know how to deal with an
   ignorant, worldly man, for his conversion! To get within him and win
   upon him; to suit our speech to his condition and temper; to choose the
   meetest subjects, and follow them with a holy mixture of seriousness,
   and terror, and love, and meekness, and evangelical allurements -- oh!
   who is fit for such a thing? I profess seriously, it seems to me, by
   experience, as hard a matter to confer aright with such a carnal
   person, in order to his change, as to preach such sermons as ordinarily
   we do, if not much more. All these difficulties in ourselves should
   awaken us to holy resolution, preparation, and diligence, that we may
   not be overcome by them, and hindered from or in the work.

   2. Having noticed these difficulties in ourselves, I shall now mention
   some which we shall meet with in our people.

   (1) Many of them will be obstinately unwilling to be taught; and scorn
   to come to us, as being too good to be catechized, or too old to learn,
   unless we deal wisely with them in public and private, and study, by
   the force of reason, and the power of love, to conquer their
   perverseness.

   (2) Many that are willing are so dull, that they can scarcely learn a
   leaf of a catechism in a long time, and therefore they will keep away,
   as ashamed of their ignorance, unless we are wise and diligent to
   encourage them.

   (3) And when they do come, so great is the ignorance and
   unapprehensiveness of many, that you will find it a very hard matter to
   get them to understand you; so that if you have not the happy art of
   making things plain, you will leave them as ignorant as before.

   (4) And yet harder will you find it to work things upon their hearts,
   and to set them so home to their consciences, as to produce that saving
   change, which is our grand aim, and without which our labor is lost. Oh
   what a block, what a rock, is a hardened, carnal heart! How strongly
   will it resist the most powerful persuasions, and hear of everlasting
   life or death, as a thing of nought! If, therefore, you have not great
   seriousness, and fervency, and powerful matter, and fitness of
   expression, what good can you expect. And when you have done all, the
   Spirit of grace must do the work. But as God and men usually choose
   instruments suitable to the nature of the work or end, so the Spirit of
   wisdom, life, and holiness doth not usually work by foolish, dead,
   carnal instruments, but by such persuasions of light and life and
   purity as are likest to itself, and to the work that is to be wrought
   thereby.

   (5) Lastly, When you have made some desirable impressions on their
   hearts, if you look not after them, and have a special care of them,
   their hearts will soon return to their former hardness, and their old
   companions and temptations will destroy all again. In short, all the
   difficulties of the work of conversion, which you use to acquaint your
   people with, are before us in our present work.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ARTICLE 3

  MOTIVES FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE WORK

   The third sort of motives are drawn from the necessity of the work. For
   if it were not necessary, the slothful might be discouraged rather than
   excited by the difficulties now mentioned. But because I have already
   been longer than I intended, I shall give you only a brief hint of some
   of the general grounds of this necessity.

   1. This duty is necessary for the glory of God. As every Christian
   liveth to the glory of God, as his end, so will he gladly take that
   course which will most effectually promote it. For what man would not
   attain his ends? O brethren, if we could set this work on foot in all
   the parishes of England, and get our people to submit to it, and then
   prosecute it skilfully and zealously ourselves, what a glory would it
   put upon the face of the nation, and what glory would, by means of it,
   redound to God! If our common ignorance were thus banished, and our
   vanity and idleness turned into the study of the way of life, and every
   shop and every house were busied in learning the Scriptures and
   catechisms, and speaking of the Word and works of God, what pleasure
   would God take in our cities and country! He would even dwell in our
   habitations, and make them his delight. It is the glory of Christ that
   shineth in his saints, and all their glory is his glory. That,
   therefore, which honoureth them, in number or excellency, honoureth
   him. Will not the glory of Christ be wonderfully displayed in the New
   Jerusalem, when it shall descend from heaven in all that splendor and
   magnificence with which it is described in the Book of Revelation? If,
   therefore, we can increase the number or strength of the saints, we
   shall thereby increase the glory of the King of saints; for he will
   have service and praise where before he had disobedience and dishonor.
   Christ will also be honored in the fruits of his blood shed, and the
   Spirit of grace in the fruit of his operations. And do not such
   important ends as these require that we use the means with diligence?

   Every Christian is obliged to do all he can for the salvation of
   others; but every minister is doubly obliged, because he is separated
   to the gospel of Christ, and is to give up himself wholly to that work.
   It is needless to make any further question of our obligation, when we
   know that this work is needful to our people's conversion and
   salvation, and that we are in general commanded to do all that is
   needful to these ends, as far as we are able. Whether the unconverted
   have need of conversion, I hope is not doubted among us. And whether
   this be a means, and a most needful means, experience may put beyond a
   doubt, if we had no more. Let them that have taken most pains in
   public, examine their people, and try whether many of them are not
   nearly as ignorant and careless as if they had never heard the gospel.
   For my part, I study to speak as plainly and movingly as I can, (and
   next to my study to speak truly, these are my chief studies,) and yet I
   frequently meet with those that have been my hearers eight or ten
   years, who know not whether Christ be God or man, and wonder when I
   tell them the history of his birth and life and death, as if they had
   never heard it before. And of those who know the history of the gospel,
   how few are there who know the nature of that faith, repentance, and
   holiness which it requireth, or, at least, who know their own hearts?
   But most of them have an ungrounded trust in Christ, hoping that he
   will pardon, justify, and save them, while the world hath their hearts,
   and they live to the flesh. And this trust they take for justifying
   faith. I have found by experience, that some ignorant persons, who have
   been so long unprofitable hearers, have got more knowledge and remorse
   of conscience in half an hour's close discourse, than they did from ten
   years' public preaching.

   I know that preaching the gospel publicly is the most excellent means,
   because we speak to many at once. But it is usually far more effectual
   to preach it privately to a particular sinner, as to himself: for the
   plainest man that is, can scarcely speak plain enough in public for
   them to understand; but in private we may do it much more. In public we
   may not use such homely expressions, or repetitions, as their dulness
   requires, but in private we may. In public our speeches are long, and
   we quite over-run their understandings and memories, and they are
   confounded and at a loss, and not able to follow us, and one thing
   drives out another, and so they know not what we said. But in private
   we can take our work gradatim, and take our hearers along with us; and,
   by our questions, and their answers, we can see how far they understand
   us, and what we have next to do. In public, by length and speaking
   alone we lose their attention; but when they are interlocutors, we can
   easily cause them to attend. Besides, we can better answer their
   objections, and engage them by promises before we leave them, which in
   public we cannot do. I conclude, therefore, that public preaching will
   not be sufficient: for though it may be an effectual means to convert
   many, yet not so many, as experience, and God's appointment of further
   means, may assure us. Long may you study and preach to little purpose,
   if you neglect this duty.

   2. This duty is necessary to the welfare of our people. Brethren, can
   you look believingly on your miserable people, and not perceive them
   calling to you for help? There is not a sinner whose case you should
   not so far compassionate, as to be willing to relieve them at a much
   dearer rate than this comes to. Can you see them, as the wounded man by
   the way, and unmercifully pass by? Can you hear them cry to you, as the
   man of Macedonia to Paul, in vision, Come and help us,' and yet refuse
   your help? Are you intrusted with the charge of an hospital, where one
   languisheth in one corner, and another groaneth in another, and crieth
   out, Oh, help me, pity me for the Lord's sake!' and where a third is
   raging mad, and would destroy himself and you; and yet will you sit
   idle and refuse your help. If it may be said of him that relieveth not
   men's bodies, how much more of him that relieveth not men's souls, If
   he see his brother have need, and shut up his bowels of compassion from
   him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?' You are not such monsters,
   such hard-hearted men, but you will pity a leper; you will pity the
   naked, the imprisoned, or the desolate; you will pity him that is
   tormented with grievous pain or sickness; and will you not pity an
   ignorant, hard-hearted sinner will you not pity one that must be shut
   out from the presence of the Lord, and lie under his remediless wrath,
   if thorough repentance speedily prevent it not? Oh what a heart is it
   that will not pity such a one! What shall I call the heart of such a
   man? A heart of stone, a very rock or adamant; the heart of a tiger; or
   rather the heart of an infidel: for surely if he believed the misery of
   the impenitent, it is not possible but he should take pity on him. Can
   you tell men in the pulpit that they shall certainly be damned, except
   they repent, and yet have no pity on them when you have proclaimed to
   them such a danger? And if you pity them, will you not do this much for
   their salvation?

   How many around you are blindly hastening to perdition, while your
   voice is appointed to be the means of arousing and reclaiming them! The
   physician hath no excuse who is doubly bound to relieve the sick, when
   even every neighbor is bound to help them. Brethren, what if you heard
   sinners cry after you in the streets, O sir, have pity on me, and
   afford me your advice! I am afraid of the everlasting wrath of God. I
   know I must shortly leave this world, and I am afraid lest I shall be
   miserable in the next.' Could you deny your help to such poor sinners?
   What if they came to your study-door, and cried for help, and would not
   go away till you had told them how to escape the wrath of God? Could
   you find in your hearts to drive them away without advice? I am
   confident you could not. Why, alas! such persons are less miserable
   than they who will not cry for help. It is the hardened sinner who
   cares not for your help, that most needs it: and he that hath not so
   much life as to feel that he is dead, nor so much light as to see his
   danger, nor so much sense left as to pity himself -- this is the man
   that is most to be pitied. Look upon your neighbors around you, and
   think how many of them need your help in no less a case than the
   apparent danger of damnation. Suppose that you heard every impenitent
   person whom you see and know about you crying to you for help, As ever
   you pitied poor wretches, pity us, lest we should be tormented in the
   flames of hell: if you have the hearts of men, pity us.' Now, do that
   for them that you would do if they followed you with such
   expostulations. Oh how can you walk, and talk, and be merry with such
   people, when you know their case? Methinks, when you look them in the
   face, and think how they must suffer everlasting misery, you should
   break forth into tears (as the prophet did when he looked upon Hazael),
   and then fall on with the most importunate exhortations. When you visit
   them in their sickness, will it not wound your hearts to see them ready
   to depart into misery, before you have ever dealt seriously with them
   for their conversion? Oh, then, for the Lord's sake, and for the sake
   of poor souls, have pity on them, and bestir yourselves, and spare no
   pains that may conduce to their salvation.

   3. This duty is necessary to your own welfare, as well as to your
   people's. This is your work, according to which, among others, you
   shall be judged. You can no more be saved without ministerial diligence
   and fidelity, than they or you can be saved without Christian diligence
   and fidelity. If, therefore, you care not for others, care at least for
   yourselves. Oh what a dreadful thing is it to answer for the neglect of
   such a charge! and what sin more heinous than the betraying of souls?
   Doth not that threatening make you tremble -- If thou dost not speak to
   warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his
   iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand?' I am afraid, nay,
   I have no doubt, that the day is near when unfaithful ministers will
   wish that they had never known the charge of souls; but that they had
   rather been colliers, or sweeps, or tinkers, than pastors of Christ's
   flock, when, besides all the rest of their sins, they shall have the
   blood of so many souls to answer for. O brethren, our death, as well as
   our people's, is at hand, and it is as terrible to an unfaithful pastor
   as to any. When we see that die we must, and that there is no remedy;
   that no wit, nor learning, nor popular applause, can avert the stroke,
   or delay the time; but, willing or unwilling, our souls must be gone,
   and that into a world which we never saw, where our persons and our
   worldly interest will not be respected; oh, then for a clear
   conscience, that can say, I lived not to myself but to Christ; I spared
   not my pains; I hid not my talents; I concealed not men's misery, nor
   the way of their recovery.' O sirs, let us therefore take time while we
   have it, and work while it is day; for the night cometh, when no man
   can work.' This is our day too; and by doing good to others, we must do
   good to ourselves. If you would prepare for a comfortable death, and a
   great and glorious reward, the harvest is before you. Gird up the loins
   of your minds, and quit yourselves like men, that you may end your days
   with these triumphant words: I have fought a good fight, I have
   finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up
   for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
   shall give unto me in that day.' If you would be blessed with those
   that die in the Lord, labor now, that you may rest from your labors
   then, and do such works as you would wish should follow you, and not
   such as will prove your terror in the review.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ARTICLE 4

  APPLICATION OF THESE MOTIVES

   Having found so many and so powerful reasons to move us to this work, I
   shall now apply them further for our humiliation and excitation.

   1. What cause have we to bleed before the Lord this day, that we have
   neglected so great and good a work so long; that we have been ministers
   of the gospel so many years, and done so little by personal instruction
   and conference for the saving of men's souls! If we had but set about
   this business sooner, who knows how many souls might have been brought
   to Christ, and how much happier our congregations might have been? And
   why might we not have done it sooner as well as now? I confess, there
   were many impediments in our way, and so there are still, and will be
   while there is a devil to tempt, and a corrupt heart in man to resist
   the light: but if the greatest impediment had not been in ourselves,
   even in our own darkness, and dulness, and indisposedness to duty, and
   our dividedness and unaptness to close for the work of God, I see not
   but much might have been done before this. We had the same God to
   command us, and the same miserable objects of compassion, and the same
   liberty from governors as now we have. We have sinned, and have no just
   excuse for our sin; and the sin is so great, because the duty is so
   great, that we should be afraid of pleading any excuse. The God of
   mercy forgive us, and all the ministry of England, and lay not this or
   any of our ministerial negligences to our charge! Oh that he would
   cover all our unfaithfulness, and, by the blood of the everlasting
   covenant, wash away our guilt of the blood of souls; that when the
   chief Shepherd shall appear, we may stand before him in peace, and may
   not be condemned for the scattering of his flock. And oh that he would
   put up his controversy, which he hath against the pastors of his
   Church, and not deal the worse with them for our sakes, nor suffer
   underminers or persecutors to scatter them, as they have suffered his
   sheep to be scattered; and that he will not care as little for us, as
   we have done for the souls of men; nor think his salvation too good for
   us, as we have thought our labor and sufferings too much for men's
   salvation!

   As we have had many days of humiliation in England for the sins of the
   land, and the judgments that have befallen us, I hope we shall hear
   that God will more thoroughly humble the ministry, and cause them to
   bewail their own neglects, and to set apart some days through the land
   to that end, that they may not think it enough to lament the sins of
   others, while they overlook their own; and that God may not abhor our
   solemn national humiliations, because they are managed by unhumbled
   guides; and that we may first prevail with him for a pardon for
   ourselves, that we may be the fitter to beg for the pardon of others.

   And oh that we may cast out the dung of our pride, contention,
   self-seeking, and idleness; lest God should cast our sacrifices as dung
   in our faces, and should cast us out as the dung of the earth, as of
   late he hath done many others for a warning to us; and that we may
   presently resolve in concord to mend our pace, before we feel a sharper
   spur than hitherto we have felt.

   2. And now, brethren, what have we to do for the time to come, but to
   deny our lazy flesh, and rouse up ourselves to the work before us. The
   harvest is great, the laborers are few; the loiterers and hinderers are
   many, the souls of men are precious, the misery of sinners is great,
   and the everlasting misery to which they are near is greater, the joys
   of heaven are inconceivable, the comfort of a faithful minister is not
   small, the joy of extensive success will be a full reward. To be
   fellow-workers with God and his Spirit is no little honor; to subserve
   the blood-shedding of Christ for men's salvation is not a light thing.
   To lead on the armies of Christ through the thickest of the enemy; to
   guide them safely through a dangerous wilderness; to steer the vessels
   through such storms and rocks and sands and shelves, and bring it safe
   to the harbour of rest, requireth no small skill and diligence. The
   fields now seem even white unto harvest; the preparations that have
   been made for us are very great; the season of working is more calm
   than most ages before us have ever seen. We have carelessly loitered
   too long already; the present time is posting away; while we are
   trifling, men are dying; oh how fast are they passing into another
   world! And is there nothing in all this to awaken us to our duty,
   nothing to resolve us to speedy and unwearied diligence? Can we think
   that a man can be too careful and painful under all these motives and
   engagements? Or can that man be a fit instrument for other men's
   illumination, who is himself so blind? or for the quickening of others,
   who is himself so senseless? What, sirs! are ye, who are men of wisdom,
   as dull as the common people? and do we need to heap up a multitude of
   words to persuade you to a known and weighty duty? One would think it
   should be enough to set you on work, to show a line in the Book of God;
   to prove it to be his will; or to prove to you that the work hath a
   tendency to promote men's salvation. One would think that the very
   sight of your miserable neighbors would be motive sufficient to draw
   out your most compassionate endeavors for their relief. If a cripple do
   but unlap his sores, and show you his disabled limbs, it will move you
   without words; and will not the case of souls, that are near to
   damnation, move you? O happy church, if the physicians were but healed
   themselves; and if we had not too much of that infidelity and stupidity
   against which we daily preach in others; and were more soundly
   persuaded of that of which we persuade others; and were more deeply
   affected with the wonderful things wherewith we would affect them!

   Were there but such clear and deep impressions upon our own souls of
   those glorious things which we daily preach, oh what a change would it
   make in our sermons, and in our private course of life! Oh what a
   miserable thing it is to the Church and to themselves, that men must
   preach of heaven and hell, before they soundly believe that there are
   such things, or have felt the weight of the doctrines which they
   preach! It would amaze a sensible man to think what matters we preach
   and talk of; what it is for the soul to pass out of this flesh, and
   appear before a righteous God, and enter upon unchangeable joy or
   unchangeable torment! Oh, with what amazing thoughts do dying men
   apprehend these things! How should such matters be preached and
   discoursed of! Oh the gravity, the seriousness, the incessant
   diligence, which these things require! I know not what others think of
   them; but for my part, I am ashamed of my stupidity, and wonder at
   myself that I deal not with my own and others' souls, as one that looks
   for the great day of the Lord; and that I can have room for almost any
   other thoughts or words; and that such astonishing matters do not
   wholly absorb my mind. I marvel how I can preach of them slightly and
   coldly, and how I can let men alone in their sins, and that I do not go
   to them, and beseech them, for the Lord's sake, to repent, however they
   may take it, and whatever pains or trouble it may cost me! I seldom
   come out of the pulpit, but my conscience smiteth me that I have been
   no more serious and fervent in such a case. It accuseth me not so much
   for want of ornaments or elegancy, nor for letting fall an unhandsome
   word; but it asketh me, How couldst thou speak of life and death with
   such a heart? How couldst thou preach of heaven and hell in such a
   careless, sleepy manner? Dost thou believe what thou sayest? Art thou
   in earnest or in jest? How canst thou tell people that sin is such a
   thing, and that so much misery is upon them and before them, and be no
   more affected with it? Shouldst thou not weep over such a people, and
   should not thy tears interrupt thy words? Shouldst not thou cry aloud,
   and show them their transgressions, and entreat and beseech them as for
   life and death?' Truly, this is the peal that conscience doth ring in
   my ears, and yet my drowsy soul will not be awakened.

   Oh what a thing is a senseless, hardened heart! O Lord, save us from
   the plague of infidelity and hard-heartedness ourselves, or else how
   shall we be fit instruments of saving others from it? Oh, do that on
   our own souls, which thou wouldst use us to do on the souls of others!
   I am even confounded to think what a difference there is between my
   sickbed apprehensions, and my pulpit apprehensions, of the life to
   come; that ever that can seem so light a matter to me now, which seemed
   so great and astonishing a matter then, and I know will do so again
   when death looks me in the face, when yet I daily know and think of
   that approaching hour; and yet these forethoughts will not recover such
   working apprehensions! O sirs, surely if you had all conversed with
   neighbor Death as oft as I have done, and as often received the
   sentence in yourselves, you would have an unquiet conscience, if not a
   reformed life, as to your ministerial diligence and fidelity; and you
   would have something within you that would frequently ask you such
   questions as these: Is this all thy compassion for lost sinners? Wilt
   thou do no more to seek and to save them? Is there not such and such --
   oh how many round about thee! -- that are yet the visible sons of
   death? What hast thou said to them, or done for their conversion? Shall
   they die and be in hell before thou wilt speak to them one serious word
   to prevent it? Shall they there curse thee for ever that didst no more
   in time to save them?'

   Such cries of conscience are daily ringing in mine ears, though, the
   Lord knows, I have too little obeyed them. The God of mercy pardon me,
   and awaken me, with the rest of his servants that have been thus
   sinfully negligent. I confess to my shame that I seldom hear the bell
   toll for one that is dead, but conscience asketh me, What hast thou
   done for the saving of that soul before it left the body? There is one
   more gone to judgment; what didst thou to prepare him for judgment?'
   and yet I have been slothful and backward to help them that survive.
   How can you choose, when you are laying a corpse in the grave, but
   think with yourselves, Here lieth the body; but where is the soul? and
   what have I done for it, before it departed? It was part of my charge;
   what account can I give of it?'

   O sirs, is it a small matter to you to answer such questions as these?
   It may seem so now, but the hour is coming when it will not seem so. If
   our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts,' and will
   condemn us much more, even with another kind of condemnation than
   conscience doth. The voice of conscience is a still voice, and the
   sentence of conscience is a gentle sentence, in comparison of the voice
   and the sentence of God. Alas! conscience seeth but a very little of
   our sin and misery, in comparison of what God seeth. What mountains
   would these things appear to your souls, which now seem molehills? What
   beams would these be in your eyes, that now seem motes, if you did but
   see them with a clearer light? (I dare not say, As God seeth them.) We
   can easily make shift to plead the cause with conscience, and either
   bribe it, or bear its sentence; but God is not so easily dealt with,
   nor his sentence so easily borne. Wherefore we receiving,' and
   preaching, a kingdom that cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we
   may serve God acceptably, with reverence, and godly fear; for our God
   is a consuming fire.' But because you shall not say that I affright you
   with bugbears, and tell you of dangers and terrors when there are none,
   I will here show you the certainty and sureness of that condemnation
   that is like to befall negligent pastors, particularly how many will be
   ready to rise up against us and condemn us, if we shall hereafter be
   wilful neglecters of this great work.

   (1) Our parents, that destined us to the ministry, will condemn us, and
   say, Lord, we devoted them to thy service, and they made light of it,
   and served themselves.'

   (2) Our masters that taught us, our tutors that instructed us, the
   schools and universities where we lived, and all the years that we
   spent in study, will rise up in judgment against us, and condemn us;
   for why was all this, but for the work of God

   (3) Our learning and knowledge and ministerial gifts will condemn us;
   for to what end were we made partakers of these, but for the work of
   God

   (4) Our voluntary undertaking the charge of souls will condemn us; for
   all men should be faithful to the trust which they have undertaken.

   (5) All the care of God for his Church, and all that Christ hath done
   and suffered for it, will rise up in judgment against us, if we be
   negligent and unfaithful, and condemn us; because by our neglect we
   destroyed them for whom Christ died.

   (6) All the precepts and charges of Holy Scripture, all the promises of
   assistance and reward, all the threatenings of punishment, will rise up
   against us and condemn us; for God did not speak all this in vain.

   (7) All the examples of the prophets and apostles, and other preachers
   recorded in Scripture, and all the examples of the faithful and
   diligent servants of Christ in these latter times, and in the places
   around us, will rise up in judgment and condemn us; for all these were
   for our imitation, and to provoke us to a holy emulation in fidelity
   and ministerial diligence.

   (8) The Holy Bible that lies open before us, and all the books in our
   studies that tell us of our duty, directly or indirectly, will condemn
   the lazy and unprofitable servant; for we have not all these helps and
   furniture in vain.

   (9) All the sermons that we preach to persuade our people to work out
   their salvation with fear and trembling, to lay violent hands upon the
   crown of life, and take the kingdom by force, to strive to enter in at
   the strait gate, and so to run as to obtain, will rise up against the
   unfaithful and condemn them; for if it so nearly concern them to labor
   for their salvation, doth it not concern us who have the charge of them
   to be also violent, laborious, and unwearied in striving to help on
   their salvation? Is it worth their labor, and patience, and is it not
   also worth ours?

   (10) All the sermons that we preach to them to set forth the evil of
   sin, the danger of a natural state, the need of a Savior, the joys of
   heaven, and the torments of hell, yea, and the truth of the Christian
   religion, will rise up in judgment against the unfaithful, and condemn
   them. And a sad review it will be to themselves, when they shall be
   forced to think, Did I tell them of such great dangers and hopes in
   public, and would I do no more, in private, to help them? What? tell
   them daily of damnation, and yet let them run into it so easily? Tell
   them of such a glory, and scarcely speak a word to them personally, to
   help them to it? Were these such great matters with me at church, and
   so small matters when I came home?' Ah! this will be dreadful
   self-condemnation.

   (11) All the sermons that we have preached to persuade other men to
   such duties -- as neighbors to exhort one another daily, and parents
   and masters to teach their children and servants the way to heaven --
   will rise up in judgment against the unfaithful, and condemn them; for
   will you persuade others to that which you will not do, as far as you
   can, yourselves? When you threaten them for neglecting their duty, how
   much more do you threaten your own souls!

   (12) All the maintenance which we take for our service, if we be
   unfaithful will condemn us; for who is it that will pay a servant to
   take his pleasure, or sit idle, or work for himself. If we have the
   fleece, surely it is that we may look after the flock; and, by taking
   the wages, we oblige ourselves to the work.

   (13) All the witness that we have borne against the scandalous,
   negligent ministers of this age, and all the endeavors that we have
   used for their removal, will condemn the unfaithful; for God is no
   respecter of persons. If we succeed them in their sins, we have spoken
   all that against ourselves; and, as we condemned them, God and others
   will condemn us, if we imitate them. And, though we should not be so
   bad as they, it will prove sad if we are even like them.

   (14) All the judgments that God hath, in this age, executed on
   negligent ministers, before our eyes, will condemn us, if we be
   unfaithful. Hath he made the idle shepherds and sensual drones to stink
   in the nostrils of the people? And will he honor us, if we be idle and
   sensual? Hath he sequestrated them, and cast them out of their
   habitations, and out of their pulpits, and laid them by as dead, while
   they are yet alive, and made them a hissing and a by-word in the land?
   And yet dare we imitate them Are not their sufferings our warnings? and
   did not all this befall them as an example to us? If any thing in the
   world would awaken ministers to self-denial and diligence, methinks we
   have seen enough to do it. Would you have imitated the old world if you
   had seen the flood that drowned it? Would you have indulged in the sins
   of Sodom -- idleness, pride, fullness of bread -- if you had stood by,
   and seen the flames which consumed it ascending up to heaven? Who would
   have been a Judas, that had seen him hanged and burst asunder? And who
   would have been a lying, sacrilegious hypocrite, that had seen Ananias
   and Sapphira die? And who would not have been afraid to contradict the
   gospel, that had seen Elymas smitten with blindness? And shall we prove
   idle, self-seeking ministers, when we have seen God scourging such out
   of his temple, and sweeping them away as dirt into the channels? God
   forbid! For then how great and how manifold will our condemnation be?

   (15) Lastly, All the days of fasting and prayer, which have, of late
   years, been kept in England for a reformation, will rise up in judgment
   against the unreformed, who will not be persuaded to the painful part
   of the work. This, I confess, is so heavy an aggravation of our sin,
   that it makes me ready to tremble to think of it. Was there ever a
   nation on the face of the earth, which so long and so solemnly followed
   God with fasting and prayer, as we have done? Before the parliament
   began, bow frequent and fervent were we in secret! After that, for many
   years together, we had a monthly fast commanded by the parliament,
   besides frequent private and public fasts on other occasions. And what
   was all this for? Whatever was, for some time, the means we looked at,
   yet still the end of all our prayers was Church-reformation, and,
   therein, especially these two things, a faithful ministry, and the
   exercise of discipline in the Church. And did it once enter then into
   the hearts of the people, or even into our own hearts, to imagine, that
   when we had all we would have, and the matter was put into our own
   hands, to be as painful as we could, and to exercise what discipline we
   would, that then we would do nothing but publicly preach? that we would
   not be at the pains of catechizing and instructing our people
   personally, nor exercise any considerable part of discipline at all? It
   astonisheth me to think of it. What a depth of deceit is the heart of
   man! What? are good men's hearts so deceitful? Are all men's hearts so
   deceitful? I confess, I then told many soldiers, and other sensual men,
   that though they had fought for a reformation, I was confident they
   would abhor it, and be enemies to it, when they saw and felt it;
   thinking that the yoke of discipline would have pinched their necks,
   and that, when they were catechized and personally dealt with, and
   reproved for their sin, in private and public, and brought to public
   confession and repentance, or avoided as impenitent, they would scorn
   and spurn at all this, and take the yoke of Christ for tyranny; but
   little did I think that the ministers would let all fall, and put
   almost none of this upon them; but let them alone for fear of
   displeasing them, and let all run on as it did before.

   Oh the earnest prayers which I have heard for a painful ministry, and
   for discipline! It was as if they had even wrestled for salvation
   itself. Yea, they commonly called discipline, the kingdom of Christ, or
   the exercise of his kingly office in his church, and so preached and
   prayed for it, as if the setting up of discipline had been the setting
   up of the kingdom of Christ. And did I then think that they would
   refuse to set it up when they might? What! is the kingdom of Christ now
   reckoned among things indifferent?

   If the God of heaven, who knew our hearts, had, in the midst of our
   prayers and cries, on one of our public monthly fasts, returned us this
   answer, with his dreadful voice, in the audience of the assembly: You
   deceitful-hearted sinners! What hypocrisy is this, to weary me with
   your cries for that which you will not have, if I would give it to you;
   and thus to lift up your voices for that which your souls abhor! What
   is reformation, but the instructing and importunate persuading of
   sinners to entertain my Christ and grace, as offered to them, and the
   governing of my Church according to my word? Yet these, which are your
   work, you will not be persuaded to, when you come to find it
   troublesome and ungrateful. When I have delivered you, it is not me,
   but yourselves, that you will serve; and I must be as earnest to
   persuade you to reform the Church, in doing your own duty, as you are
   earnest with me to grant you liberty for reformation. And, when all is
   done, you will leave it undone, and will be long before you will be
   persuaded to my work.' If the Lord, or any messenger of his, had given
   us such an answer, would it not have amazed us? Would it not have
   seemed incredible to us, that our hearts should be such as now they
   prove? And would we not have said, as Hazael, Is thy servant a dog,
   that he should do this thing' or as Peter, Though all men forsake thee,
   yet will not I?' Well, brethren, sad experience hath showed us our
   frailty. We have refused the troublesome and costly part of the
   reformation that we prayed for; but Christ yet turneth back, and
   looketh with a merciful eye upon us. Oh that we had yet the hearts
   immediately to go out and weep bitterly, and to do no more as we have
   done, lest a worse thing come upon us; and now to follow Christ, whom
   we have so far forsaken, through labor and suffering, even though it
   were to death!

   I have thus showed you what will come of it, if you will not set
   yourselves faithfully to this work, to which you are under so many
   obligations and engagements; and what an inexcusable thing our neglect
   will be, and how great and manifold a condemnation it will expose us
   to. Truly, brethren, if I did not apprehend the work to be of exceeding
   great moment to yourselves, to the people, and to the honor of God, I
   would not have troubled you with so many words about it, nor have
   presumed to speak so sharply as I have done. But when the question is
   about life and death, men are apt to forget their reverence and
   courtesy and compliments and good manners. For my own part I apprehend
   this is one of the best and greatest works I ever in my life put my
   hand to; and I verily think, that if your thoughts of it are as mine,
   you will not think my words too many or too keen. I can well remember
   the time when I was earnest for the reformation of matters of ceremony;
   and, if I should be cold in such substantial matter as this, how
   disorderly and disproportionable would my zeal appear! Alas! can we
   think that the reformation is wrought, when we cast out a few
   ceremonies, and changed some vestures, and gestures, and forms! Oh no,
   sirs! it is the converting and saving of souls that is our business.
   That is the chiefest part of reformation, that doth most good, and
   tendeth most to the salvation of the people.

   And now, brethren, the work is before you. In these personal
   instructions of all the flock, as well as in public preaching, doth it
   consist. Others have done their part, and borne their burden, and now
   comes in yours. You may easily see how great a matter lies upon your
   hands, and how many will be wronged by your failing of your duty, and
   how much will be lost by the sparing of your labor. If your labor be
   more worth than the souls of men, and than the blood of Christ, then
   sit still, and look not after the ignorant or the ungodly; follow your
   own pleasure or worldly business, or take your ease; displease not
   sinners, nor your own flesh, but let your neighbors sink or swim; and,
   if public preaching will not save them, let them perish. But, if the
   case be far otherwise, you had best look about you.

  PART II

  OBJECTIONS TO THIS DUTY

   I shall next answer some of those objections, which may be made to the
   practice I have been recommending.

    OBJECTION 1:

   We teach our people in public; and how then are we bound to teach them,
   man by man, besides?

    ANSWER:

   You pray for them in public: must you not also pray for them in
   private? Paul taught every man, and exhorted every man, and that both
   publicly, and from house to house, night and day, with tears. But what
   need we say more, when experience speaks so loudly on this subject? I
   am daily forced to wonder how lamentably ignorant many of our people
   are, who have seemed diligent hearers of me these ten or twelve years,
   while I spoke as plainly as I was able to speak. Some know not that
   each person in the Trinity is God; nor that Christ is God and man; nor
   that he took his human nature to heaven; nor what they must trust to
   for pardon and salvation; nor many similar important principles of our
   faith. Nay, some who come constantly to private meetings are grossly
   ignorant: whereas, in one hour's familiar instruction of them in
   private, they seem to understand more, and better entertain it than
   they did in all their lives before.

    OBJECTION 2:

   All the parish are not the church, nor do I take the pastoral charge of
   them, and therefore I am not satisfied that I am bound to take these
   pains with them.

    ANSWER:

   [a] The common maintenance which most receive is for teaching the whole
   parish, though you be not obliged to take them all for a church.

   [b] What need we look for a stronger obligation than the common bond
   that lieth on all Christians, to further the work of men's salvation
   and the good of the Church, and the honor of God, to the utmost of
   their power; together with the common bond that is on all ministers, to
   further these ends by ministerial teaching to the utmost of their
   power? Is it a work so good, and apparently conducing to so great
   benefits to the souls of men, and yet can you perceive no obligation to
   the doing of it?

    OBJECTION 3:

   This course will take up so much time, that a man will have no
   opportunity to follow his studies. Most of us are young and
   inexperienced, and have need of much time to improve our own abilities,
   and to increase our own knowledge, which this course will entirely
   prevent.

    ANSWER:

   (1): We suppose those whom we persuade to this work, to understand the
   substance of the Christian religion, and to be able to teach it to
   others; and the addition of lower and less necessary things, is not to
   be preferred before this needful communication of the fundamental
   principles of religion. I highly value common knowledge, and would not
   encourage any to set light by it; but I value the saving of souls more.
   That work which is our great end must be done, whatever be left undone.
   It is a very desirable thing for a physician to be thoroughly studied
   in his art; and to be able to see the reason of his practice, and to
   resolve such difficult controversies as are before him. But if he had
   the charge of a hospital, or lived in a city where the pestilence was
   raging, if he would be studying fermentation, the circulation of the
   blood, blisters, and the like, and such like excellent points, when he
   should be visiting his patients, and saving men's lives; if he should
   even turn them away, and let them perish, and tell them that he has not
   time to give them advice, because he must follow his own studies, I
   would consider that man as a most preposterous student, who preferred
   the remote means before the end itself of his studies: indeed, I would
   think him but a civil kind of murderer. Men's souls may be saved
   without knowing whether God did predetermine the creature in all its
   acts; whether the understanding necessarily determines the will;
   whether God works grace in a physical or in a moral way of causation;
   what freewill is; whether God have scientiam mediam,' or positive
   decrees concerning the blame for evil deeds; and a hundred similar
   questions, which are probably the things you would be studying when you
   should be saving souls. Get well to heaven, and help your people
   thither, and you shall know all these things in a moment, and a
   thousand more, which now, by all your studies, you can never know; and
   is not this the most expeditious and certain way to knowledge?

   (2) If you grow not extensively in knowledge, you will by this way of
   diligent practice obtain the intensive more excellent growth. If you
   know not so many things as others, you will know the great things
   better than they; for this serious dealing with sinners for their
   salvation, will help you to far deeper apprehensions of the saving
   principles of religion than you will get by any other means; and a
   little more knowledge of these is worth all the other knowledge in the
   world. Oh, when I am looking heavenward, and gazing towards the
   inaccessible light, and aspiring after the knowledge of God, and find
   my soul so dark and distant, that I am ready to say, I know not God -
   he is above me - quite out of my reach,' methinks I could willingly
   exchange all the other knowledge I have, for one glimpse more of the
   knowledge of God and of the life to come. Oh that I had never known a
   word in logic or metaphysics, nor known whatever schoolmen said, so I
   had but one spark more of that light which would show me the things
   that I must shortly see. For my part, I conceive, that by serious
   talking of everlasting things, and teaching the creed, or some short
   catechism, you may grow more in knowledge, (though not in the knowledge
   of more things,) and prove much wiser men, than if you spent that time
   in studying common or curious, yet less necessary things.

   And perhaps it will be found, before we have done, that this employment
   tends to make men much abler pastors for the Church, than private
   studies alone. He will be the ablest physician, lawyer, and divine too,
   that addeth practice and experience to his studies: while that man
   shall prove a useless drone, that refuseth God's service all his life,
   under pretense of preparing for it, and lets men's souls pass on to
   perdition, while he pretendeth to be studying how to recover them, or
   to get more ability to help and save them.

   (3) Yet let me add, that though I count this the chief, I would have
   you to have more, because these subservient sciences are very useful;
   and, therefore, I say, that you may have competent time for both, lose
   no time upon vain recreations and employments; consume it not in
   needless sleep; trifle not away a minute. Do what you do with all your
   might; and then see whether you have not competent time for these other
   pursuits. If you set apart but two days in a week to this great work,
   you may find some time for common studies out of the other four.

   Indeed, are not four days in the week, (after so many years spent in
   the university,) a fair proportion for men to study controversies and
   sermons? Though my weakness deprive me of abundance of time, and
   extraordinary works take up six, if not eight parts of my time, yet I
   bless God I can find time to provide for preaching two days a week,
   notwithstanding the two days for personal instruction. Now, for those
   that are not troubled with any extraordinary work, (I mean writings,
   and vocations of several sorts, besides the ordinary work of the
   ministry,) I cannot believe, but, if they are willing, they may find
   two half days a week at least for this work.

   (4) Duties are to be taken together: the greatest is to be preferred,
   but none are to be neglected that can be performed; no one is to be
   pleaded against another, but each is to know its proper place. But if
   there were such a case of necessity, that we could not carry on further
   studies, and instruct the ignorant too, I would throw aside all the
   libraries in the world, rather than be guilty of the perdition of one
   soul; or at least, I know that this would be my duty.

    OBJECTION 4:

   But this course will destroy the health of our bodies, by continual
   spending our spirits, and allowing us no time for necessary
   recreations; and it will wholly lock us up from friendly intercourse
   with others, so that we must never stir from home, nor enjoy ourselves
   a day with our friends, for the relaxation of our minds; but, as we
   shall seem uncourteous courteous and morose to others, so we shall tire
   ourselves, and the bow that is always bent will be in danger of
   breaking at last.

    ANSWER:

   (1): This is the plea of the flesh for its own interest. The sluggard
   saith, There is a lion in the way," nor will he plough because of the
   cold. There is no duty of moment and self-denial, but, if you consult
   with flesh and blood, it will give you as wise reasons as these against
   it. Who would ever have been burned at a stake for Christ, if this
   reasoning had been good? Yea, or who would ever have been a Christian?

   (2) We may take time for necessary recreation, and yet attend to this
   work. An hour, or half an hour's walk before meat, is as much
   recreation as is necessary for the health of most of the weaker sort of
   students. I have reason to know somewhat of this by long experience.
   Though I have a body that hath languished under great weaknesses for
   many years, and my diseases have been such as require as much exercise
   as almost any in the world, and I have found exercise the principal
   means of my preservation till now, and, therefore, have as great reason
   to plead for it as any man that I know, yet I have found that the
   foresaid proportion hath been blessed to my preservation, though I know
   that much more had been like to have tended to my greater health.
   Indeed, I do not know one minister in a hundred that needeth so much
   exercise as myself. Yea, I know abundance of ministers, that scarce
   ever use any exercise at all, though I commend them not in this. I
   doubt not but it is our duty to use so much exercise as is necessary
   for the preservation of our health, so far as our work requireth;
   otherwise, we should, for one day's work, lose the opportunity of many.
   But this may be done, and yet the work that we are engaged in, be done
   too. On those two days a week that you set apart for this work, what
   hinders but you may take an hour or two to walk for the exercise of
   your bodies? Much more on other days. But as for those men, who limit
   not their recreations to stated hours, but must have them for the
   pleasing of their voluptuous humor, and not merely to fit them for
   their work, such sensualists have need to study better the nature of
   Christianity, and to learn the danger of living after the flesh, and to
   get more mortification and self-denial before they preach these things
   to others. If you must needs have your pleasures, you should not have
   put yourselves into a calling that requireth you to make God and his
   service your pleasure, and restraineth you so much from fleshly
   pleasures. Is it not your baptismal engagement to fight against the
   flesh? and do you not know that much of the Christian warfare
   consisteth in the combat between the flesh and the spirit? and that
   this is the difference between a true Christian and an unconverted man,
   that the one liveth after the spirit, and mortifieth the deeds and
   desires of the body, and the other liveth after the flesh? And do you
   make it your calling to preach all this to others; and, notwithstanding
   this, must you needs have your pleasures? If you must, then, for shame,
   give over the preaching of the gospel, and the profession of
   Christianity, and profess yourselves to be what you are; and as you sow
   to the flesh, so of the flesh you shall reap corruption.' Doth even
   Paul say: I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as
   one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into
   subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
   myself should be a castaway?' And have not such sinners as we still
   more need to do so? What? shall we pamper our bodies and give them
   their desires in unnecessary pleasure, when Paul must keep under his
   body, and bring it into subjection? Must Paul do this, lest, after all
   his preaching, he should be a castaway? and have not we much more cause
   to fear it of ourselves I know that some pleasure is lawful; that is,
   when it is of use to fit us for our work. But for a man to be so far in
   love with his pleasures, as for the sake of them to waste unnecessarily
   his precious time, and to neglect the great work of men's salvation,
   yea, and to plead for this, as if it must or might be done, and so to
   justify himself in such a course, is a wickedness inconsistent with the
   common fidelity of a Christian, much more with the fidelity of a
   minister of Christ. Such wretches as are lovers of pleasure more than
   lovers of God,' must look to be loved of him accordingly, and are
   fitter to be cast out of Christian communion, than to be the chief in
   the Church; for we are commanded from such to turn away.' Recreations
   for a student must be specially for the exercise of his body, he having
   before him such variety of delights to his mind. And they must be used
   as whetting is by the mower, that is, only so far as is necessary to
   his work. We must be careful that they rob us not of our precious time,
   but be kept within the narrowest possible bounds.

   (3) The labor in which we are engaged is not likely much to impair our
   health. It is true, it must be serious; but that will but excite and
   revive our spirits, and not so much spend them. Men can talk all day
   long about other matters without any abatement of their health; and why
   may we not talk with men about their salvation without such great
   abatement of ours?

   (4) What have we our time and strength for, but to lay them out for
   God? What is a candle made for, but to burn? Burned and wasted we must
   be; and is it not fitter it should be in lighting men to heaven, and in
   working for God, than in living to the flesh? How little difference is
   there between the pleasure of a long and of a short life, when they are
   both at an end! What comfort will it be to you at death, that you
   lengthened your life by shortening your work? He that worketh much,
   liveth much. Our life is to be esteemed according to the ends and works
   of it, and not according to the mere duration. As Seneca says of a
   drone, There he lies, not there he lives; and long he abode, not long
   he lived.' Will it not comfort us more at death, to review a short time
   faithfully spent, than a long life spent unfaithfully?

   (5) As for visits and civilities, if they be of greater use than our
   ministerial employments, you may break the Sabbath for them; you may
   forbear preaching for them, and you may also forbear this private work.
   But if it be otherwise, how dare you make them a pretense for
   neglecting so great a duty? Must God wait on your friends? What though
   they be lords, or knights, or gentlemen; must they be served before
   God? Or is their displeasure or censure a greater hurt to you than
   God's displeasure or censure? Or dare you think, when God will question
   you for your neglects, to put him off with this excuse: Lord, I would
   have spent more of my time in seeking men's salvation; but such a
   gentleman, or such a friend, would have taken it ill, if I had not
   waited on them?' If you yet seek to please men,' you are no longer the
   servants of Christ. He that dare spend his life in flesh-pleasing, and
   man-pleasing, is bolder than I am. And he that dare waste his time in
   compliments, doth little consider what he hath to do with it. Oh that I
   could but improve my time, according to my convictions of the necessity
   of improving it! He that hath looked death in the face as oft as I have
   done, I will not thank him if he value his time. I profess I wonder at
   those ministers who have time to spare; who can hunt or shoot or bowl,
   or use the like recreations two or three hours, yea, whole days
   together; that can sit an hour together in vain discourse, and spend
   whole days in complimental visits, and journeys to such ends. Good
   Lord! What do these men think on, when so many souls around them cry
   for help, and death gives us no respite, and they know not how short a
   time their people and they may be together; when the smallest parish
   hath so much work that may employ all their diligence, night and day?

   Brethren, I hope you are content to be plainly dealt with. If you have
   no sense of the worth of souls, and of the preciousness of that blood
   which was shed for them, and of the glory to which they are going, and
   of the misery of which they are in danger, you are not Christians, and
   consequently are very unfit to be ministers. And if you have, how can
   you find time for needless recreations, visits or discourses? Dare you,
   like idle gossips, chat and trifle away your time, when you have such
   works as these to do, and so many of them? O precious time! How swiftly
   doth it pass away! How soon will it be gone! What are the forty years
   of my life that are past? Were every day as long as a month, methinks
   it were too short for the work of a day. Have we not already lost time
   enough, in the days of our vanity? Never do I come to a dying man that
   is not utterly stupid, but he better sees the worth of time. O then, if
   they could call time back again, how loud would they call! If they
   could but buy it, what would they not give for it? And yet we can
   afford to trifle it away; yea, and to allow ourselves in this, and
   wilfully to cast off the greatest works of God. O what a befooling
   thing is sin, that can thus distract men that seem so wise! Is it
   possible that a man of any compassion and honesty, or any concern about
   his ministerial duty, or any sense of the strictness of his account,
   should have time to spare for idleness and vanity?

   And I must tell you further, brethren, that, if another might take some
   time for mere delight, which is not necessary, yet so cannot you; for
   your undertaking binds you to stricter attendance than other men are
   bound to. May a physician, when the plague is raging, take any more
   relaxation or recreation than is necessary for his life, when so many
   are expecting his help in a case of life and death? As his pleasure is
   not worth men's lives, still less is yours worth men's souls. Suppose a
   city were besieged, and the enemy watching, on one side, all advantages
   to surprise it, and, on the other, seeking to fire it with grenades,'
   which they are throwing in continually, I pray you, tell me, if certain
   men undertake, as their office, to watch the ports, and others to
   quench the fire that may be kindled in the houses, what time will you
   allow these men for recreation or relaxation when the city is in
   danger, and the fire will burn on and prevail, if they intermit their
   diligence? Or would you excuse one of these men, if he come off his
   work, and say, I am but flesh and blood, I must have some relaxation
   and pleasure? Surely, at the utmost, you would allow him none but what
   was absolutely necessary. Do not grudge at this, and say, This is a
   hard saying; who can hear it?' For it is your mercy; and you are well,
   if you know when you are well, as I shall show you in answering the
   next objection.

    OBJECTION 5:

   I do not think that it is required of ministers that they make drudges
   of themselves. If they preach diligently, and visit the sick, and
   perform other ministerial duties, and occasionally do good to those
   they converse with, I do not think that God doth require that we should
   thus tie ourselves to instruct every person distinctly, and to make our
   lives a burden and a slavery.

    ANSWER:

   Of what use and weight the duty is, I have showed before, and how
   plainly it is commanded. And do you think God doth not require you to
   do all the good you can? Will you stand by, and see sinners gasping
   under the pangs of death, and say, God doth not require me to make
   myself a drudge to save them?' Is this the voice of Christian or
   ministerial compassion? Or rather is it not the voice of sensual
   laziness and diabolical cruelty? Doth God set you work to do, and will
   you not believe that he would have you do it? Is this the voice of
   obedience, or of rebellion? It is all one whether your flesh prevail
   with you to deny obedience to acknowledged duty, and say plainly, I
   will obey no further than it pleaseth me; or whether it may make you
   wilfully reject the evidence that should convince you that it is a
   duty, and say, I will not believe it to be my duty, unless it please
   me. It is the character of a hypocrite, to make a religion to himself
   of the cheapest part of God's service which will stand with his fleshly
   ends and felicity, and to reject the rest, which is inconsistent
   therewith. And to the words of hypocrisy, this objection superaddeth
   the words of gross impiety. For what a wretched calumny is this against
   the most high God, to call his service a slavery and drudgery! What
   thoughts have such men of their Master, their work, and their wages?
   the thoughts of a believer, or of an infidel. Are these men like to
   honor God, and promote his service, that have such base thoughts of it
   themselves? Do these men delight in holiness, that account it a slavish
   work? Do they believe indeed the misery of sinners, that account it
   such a drudgery to be diligent to save them? Christ saith, that he that
   denieth not himself, and forsaketh not all, and taketh not up his
   cross, and followeth him, cannot be his disciple.' But these men count
   it a slavery to labor hard in his vineyard, and to deny their ease, at
   a time when they have all accommodations and encouragements. How far is
   this from forsaking all! And how can these men be fit for the ministry,
   who are such enemies to self-denial, and so to true Christianity?

   I am, therefore, forced to say, that hence arises the chief misery of
   the Church, that so many are made ministers before they are Christians.
   If these men had seen the diligence of Christ in doing good, when he
   neglected his meat to talk with one woman, and when he had no time to
   eat bread, would they not have been of the mind of his carnal friends,
   who went to lay hold on him, and said, He is beside himself?' They
   would have told Christ he made a drudge or a slave of himself, and God
   did not require all this ado. If they had seen him all day in
   preaching, and all night in prayer, it seems he would have had this
   censure from them for his labor. I cannot but advise these men to
   search their own hearts, whether they unfeignedly believe that Word
   which they preach. Do you indeed believe that such glory awaiteth those
   who die in the Lord, and such torment those that die unconverted? If
   you do, how can you think any labor too much for such weighty ends? If
   you do not, say so, and get you out of the vineyard, and go with the
   prodigal to keep swine, and undertake not to feed the flock of Christ.

   Do you not know, brethren, that it is your own benefit which you grudge
   at? The more you do, the more you will receive: the more you lay out,
   the more you will have coming in. If you are strangers to these
   Christian paradoxes, you should not have undertaken to teach them to
   others. At present, our incomes of spiritual life and peace are
   commonly in the way of duty; so that he who is most in duty hath most
   of God. Exercise of grace increaseth it. And is it a slavery to be more
   with God, and to receive more from him, than other men? It is the chief
   solace of a gracious soul to be doing good, and receiving by doing; and
   to be much exercised about those Divine things which have his heart.
   Besides, we prepare for fuller receivings hereafter; we put out our
   talents to usury, and, by improving them, we shall make five become
   ten, and so be made rulers of ten cities. Is it a drudgery to send to
   the most distant parts of the world, to exchange our trifles for gold
   and jewels? Do not these men seek to justify the profane, who make all
   diligent godliness a drudgery, and reproach it as a precise and tedious
   life, and say they will never believe but a man may be saved without
   all this ado? Even so say these in respect to the work of the ministry.
   They take this diligence for ungrateful tediousness, and will not
   believe but a man may be a faithful minister without all this ado!

   It is a heinous sin to be negligent in so great a business; but to
   approve of that negligence, and so to be impenitent, and to plead
   against duty as if it were none, and when they should lay out
   themselves for the saving of souls, to say, I do not believe that God
   requireth it - this is so great an aggravation of the sin, that, where
   the Church's necessity doth not force us to make use of such men for
   want of better, I cannot but think them worthy to be cast out as
   rubbish, and as salt that hath lost its savor, that is neither fit for
   the land, nor yet for the dunghill.' He that hath ears to hear,' adds
   Christ, let him hear.' And if such ministers become a byword and a
   reproach, let them thank themselves; for it is their own sin that
   maketh them vile. And while they thus debase the service of Christ,
   they do but debase themselves, and prepare for a greater debasement at
   the last.

    OBJECTION 6:

   The times that Paul lived in required more diligence than ours. The
   churches were but in the planting, the enemies many, and persecution
   great. But now it is not so.

    ANSWER:

   This argument savours of a man locked up in a study and unacquainted
   with the world. Good Lord! Are there such multitudes round about us
   that know not whether Christ be God or man, whether he have taken his
   body to heaven or left it on earth, nor what he hath done for their
   salvation, nor what they must trust to for pardon and everlasting life?
   Are there so many thousands round about us who are drowned in
   presumption, security, and sensuality, and, when we have done all we
   can in the pulpit, will neither feel us nor understand us? Are there so
   many wilful drunkards, worldlings, self-seekers, railers, haters of a
   holy life, that want nothing but death to make them remediless? Are
   there so many ignorant dull and scandalous professors, so many
   dividers, seducers, and troublers of the Church. And yet is the
   happiness of our times so great, that we may excuse ourselves from
   personal instruction, because of the less necessity of the times? What
   needs there but faith and experience to answer this objection? Believe
   better within and look more without among the miserable, and I warrant
   you, you will not see cause to spare your pains for want of work, or of
   necessities to invite you. What conscientious minister finds not work
   enough to do from one end of the year to another, if he have not even
   an hundred souls to care for? Are ungodly men the less miserable,
   because they make profession of Christianity, or the more?

    OBJECTION 7:

   But if you make such severe laws for ministers, the Church will be left
   without them. For what man will choose such a toilsome life for
   himself? or what parents will impose such a burden on their children?
   Men will avoid it both for the bodily toil, and the danger to their
   consciences, if they should not well discharge it.

    ANSWER:

   (1): It is not we, but Christ, who hath made and imposed these laws
   which you call severe: and if I should silence them or misinterpret
   them, that would not relax them, nor excuse you. He that made them,
   knew why he did it, and will expect obedience to them. Is infinite
   goodness to be questioned or suspected by us, as making bad or
   unmerciful laws? Nay, it is pure mercy in him to impose this great duty
   upon us. If physicians were required to be as diligent as possible in
   hospitals, or pest-houses, or with other patients in order to save
   their lives, would there not be more of mercy than of rigour in this
   law? What! must God let the souls of your neighbors perish, to save you
   a little labor and suffering; and this in mercy to you? Oh, what a
   miserable world should we have, if blind, self-conceited man had the
   ruling of it!

   (2) As to a supply of pastors, Christ will take care of that. He who
   imposeth duty hath the fullness of the Spirit, and can give men hearts
   to obey his laws. Do you think Christ will suffer all men to be as
   cruel, unmerciful, fleshly, and self-seeking as you? He who himself
   undertook the work of our redemption, and bore our transgressions, and
   hath been faithful as the chief Shepherd of the Church, will not lose
   all his labor and suffering for want of instruments to carry on his
   work, nor will he come down again to do all himself, because no other
   will do it; but he will provide men to be his servants and ushers in
   his school, who shall willingly take the labor on them, and rejoice to
   be so employed, and account that the happiest life in the world which
   you account so great a toil, and would not exchange it for all your
   ease and carnal pleasure; but for the saving of souls, and the
   propagating of the gospel of Christ, will be content to bear the burden
   and heat of the day; and to fill up the measure of the sufferings of
   Christ in their bodies; and to work while it is day; and to do what
   they do with all their might; and to be the servants of all, and not to
   please themselves, but others, for their edification; and to become all
   things to all men, that they may save some; and to endure all things
   for the elect's sake; and to spend and be spent for their
   fellow-creatures; though the more they love, the less they should be
   beloved, and should be accounted their enemies for telling them the
   truth. Such pastors will Christ provide his people, after his own
   heart, who will feed them with knowledge and understanding," as men
   that seek not theirs, but them.' What? do you think Christ will have no
   servants, if such as you shall, with Demas, turn to the present world,
   and forsake him?

   If you dislike his service, you may seek a better where you can find
   it, and boast of your gain in the end; but do not threaten him with the
   loss of your service. He hath made such laws as you will call severe,
   for all who will be saved, as well as for his ministers; for all who
   will be his disciples must deny themselves, and mortify the flesh, and
   be crucified to the world, and take up their cross, and follow him.'
   And yet Christ will not be without disciples, nor will he conceal his
   seeming hard terms from men to entice them to his service; but he will
   tell them of the worst, and then let them come or not, as they choose.
   He will call to them beforehand to count the cost, and will tell them,
   that the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the
   Son of man hath not where to lay his head," that he comes not to give
   them worldly peace and prosperity, but to call them to suffer with him,
   that they may reign with him,' and in patience to possess their souls,"
   to conquer, that they may be crowned and sit down with him on his
   throne.' And all this he will cause his chosen to perform. If you be
   come to that pass with Christ, as the Israelites were once with David,
   and say, Will the son of Jesse give you fields and vineyards? Every man
   to your tents, O Israel!' And if you say Now look to thy own house,
   thou Son of David," you shall see that Christ will look to his own
   house; and do you look to yours as well as you can, and tell me, at the
   hour of death and judgment, which is the better bargain, and whether
   Christ had more need of you, or you of him.

   As to scruples of conscience, for fear of failing, let it be remarked:
   First, It is not involuntary imperfections that Christ will take so
   heinously; it is unfaithfulness and wilful negligence. Second, It will
   not serve your turn to run out of the vineyard, on pretense of scruples
   that you cannot do the work as you ought. He can follow you, and
   overtake you, as he did Jonah, with such a storm as shall lay you in
   the belly of hell.' To cast off a duty because you cannot be faithful
   in the performance of it will prove but a poor excuse at last. If men
   had but reckoned well at first the difference between things temporal
   and things eternal, and what they shall lose or get by Christ, and had
   possessed that faith which is the evidence of things not seen,' and had
   lived by faith, and not by sense, all these objections would be easily
   resolved by us; and all the pleas of flesh and blood for its interest
   would appear as the reasoning of children, or rather of men who had
   lost their senses.

    OBJECTION 8:

   But to what purpose is all this, when most of the people will not
   submit? They will not come to us to be catechized, and will tell us
   that they are now too old to go to school. And therefore it is better
   to let them alone, as trouble them and ourselves to no purpose.

    ANSWER:

   (1): It is not to be denied that too many people are obstinate in their
   wickedness, that the simple ones love simplicity, and the scorners
   delight in scorning, and fools hate knowledge.' But the worse they are,
   the sadder is their case, and the more to be pitied, and the more
   diligent should we be for their recovery.

   (2) I would it were not the blame of ministers, that a great part of
   the people are so obstinate and contemptuous. If we did but burn and
   shine before them as we ought; had we convincing sermons and convincing
   lives; did we set ourselves to do all the good we could, whatever it
   might cost us; were we more meek and humble, more loving and
   charitable, and let them see that we set light by all worldly things,
   in comparison of their salvation; much more might be done by us than is
   done, and the mouths of many would be stopped; and though the wicked
   will still do wickedly, yet more would be tractable, and the wicked
   would be fewer and calmer than they are. If you say that some of the
   ablest and godliest ministers in the country have had as untractable
   and scornful parishioners as others, I answer, that some able godly men
   have been too lordly, and strange, and some of them too uncharitable
   and worldly, and backward to costly though necessary good works, and
   some of them have done but little in private, when they have done
   excellently in public, and so have hindered the fruit of their labors.
   But where there are not these impediments, experience telleth us that
   the success is much greater, at least as to the bowing of people to
   more calmness and teachableness; yet we cannot expect they all will be
   brought to so much reason.

   (3) The wilfulness of the people will not excuse us from our duty. If
   we offer them not our help, how do we know who will refuse it? Offering
   it is our part, and accepting it is theirs. If we offer it not, we
   leave them excusable, for then they refuse it not; but then we are left
   without excuse. But if they refuse our help when it is offered, we have
   done our part, and delivered our own souls.

   (4) If some refuse our help, others will accept it; and the success
   with them may be so much as may reward all our labor, were it even
   greater. All our people are not wrought on by our public preaching, and
   yet we must not, on this account, give it over as unprofitable.

    OBJECTION 9:

   But what likelihood is there that men will be converted by this means,
   who are not converted by the preaching of the Word, when that is God's
   chief ordinance for that end Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by
   the preaching of the word.'

    ANSWER:

   (1) The advantages of this course I have showed you before, and
   therefore I will not now repeat them; only, lest any think that this
   will hinder them from preaching, I may add, to the many benefits before
   mentioned, that it will be an excellent means of helping you in
   preaching. For as the physician's work is half done when he understands
   the disease, so, when you are well acquainted with your people's case,
   you will know what to preach on; and it will furnish you with useful
   matter for your sermons, to talk an hour with an ignorant or obstinate
   sinner, as much as an hour's study will do, for you will learn what you
   have need to insist on, and what objections of theirs to repel.

   (2) I hope there are none so silly as to think this conference is not
   preaching. What? doth the number we speak to make it preaching? Or doth
   interlocution make it none Surely a man may as truly preach to one, as
   to a thousand. And, as we have already said, if you examine, you will
   find that most of the preaching recorded in the New Testament, was by
   conference, and frequently interlocutory, and that with one or two,
   fewer or more, as opportunity served. Thus Christ himself did most
   commonly preach. Besides, we must take account of our people's
   learning, if we regard the success of our work.

   There is, therefore, nothing from God, from the Scriptures, or from
   right reason, to cause us to make any question of our work, or to be
   unwilling to it. But from the world, from the flesh, and from the
   devil, we shall have much, and more, perhaps, than we anticipate. But
   against all temptations, if we have recourse to God, and look, on the
   one hand, to our great obligations, and to the hopeful effects, and the
   blessed reward, on the other, we shall see that we have little cause to
   draw back, or to faint.

   Let us set before us the pattern in our text, and learn thence our
   duty. O what a lesson is here before us! But how ill is it learned by
   those who still question whether these things be their duty! I confess,
   some of these words of Paul have been so often presented before my
   eyes, and impressed upon my conscience, that I have been much convinced
   by them of my duty and my neglect. And I think this one speech better
   deserveth a twelvemonth's study, than most things that young students
   spend their time upon. O brethren! write it on your study doors - set
   it in capital letters as your copy, that it may be ever before your
   eyes. Could we but well learn two or three lines of it, what preachers
   should we be!

   [a] Our general business - Serving the lord with all humility of mind
   and with many tears.

   [b] Our special work - Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock.

   [c] Our doctrine - Repentance toward god and faith toward our lord
   Jesus Christ.

   [d] The place and manner of teaching - I have taught you publicly and
   from house to house.

   [e] His diligence, earnestness, and affection - I ceased not to warn
   every one night and day with tears. This is that which must win souls,
   and preserve them.

   [f] His faithfulness - I kept back nothing that was profitable unto
   you, and have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god.

   [g] His disinterestedness and self-denial for the sake of the gospel -
   I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel: yea these hands have
   ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me
   remembering the words of the lord Jesus, how he said, it is more
   blessed to give than to receive.

   [h] His patience and perseverance - None of these things move me
   neither count I my life dear unto me, so that I might finish my course
   with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the lord Jesus.

   [i] His prayerfulness - I commend you to god and to the word of his
   grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance
   among all them which are sanctified.

   [j] His purity of conscience - Wherefore I take you to record this day
   that I am pure from the blood of all men.

   Write all this upon your hearts, and it will do yourselves and the
   Church more good than twenty years' study of those lower things, which,
   though they may get you greater applause in the world, yet, if
   separated from these, they will make you but as sounding brass and a
   tinkling cymbal.' The great advantage of ministers having a sincere
   heart, is this, that the glory of God and the salvation of souls are
   their very end; and where that end is truly intended, no labor or
   suffering will stop them, or turn them back; for a man must have his
   end, whatever it cost him. Whatever he forgets, he will still retain
   this lesson: One thing is needful; seek ye first the kingdom of God and
   his righteousness. Hence he says, Necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe
   is unto me if I preach not the gospel.' This is it that will most
   effectually make easy all our labors, and make light all our burdens,
   and make tolerable all our sufferings, and cause us to venture on any
   hazards, if we may only win souls to Christ. That which I once made the
   motto of my colors in another warfare, I desire may be still before my
   eyes in this; which yet, according to my intentions, is not altogether
   another. On one side, He that saveth his life shall lose it." - on the
   other, Ruin not the cause for the sake of keeping one's life.' He who
   knoweth that he serveth a God that will never suffer any man to be a
   loser by him, need not fear what hazards he runs in his cause: and he
   who knows that he seeks a prize, which, if obtained, will infinitely
   overbalance his cost, may boldly engage his whole estate on it, and
   sell all to purchase so rich a pearl. Well, brethren, I will spend no
   more words in exhorting wise merchants to such a bargain, nor telling
   teachers themselves such common truths; and if I have already said more
   than is needful, I shall be glad. I hope I may now take it for granted,
   that you are resolved on the utmost diligence and fidelity in the work;
   and, on this supposition, I shall now proceed to give you some
   directions for the right management of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  PART III

  DIRECTIONS FOR THIS DUTY

   It is so great a work which we have before us, that it is a thousand
   pities it should be destroyed in the birth, and perish in our hands.
   And though I know that we have a knotty generation to deal with, and
   that it is past the power of any of us to change a carnal heart without
   the effectual operation of the Holy Ghost; yet it is so usual with God
   to work by means, and to bless the right endeavors of his servants,
   that I cannot fear but great things will be accomplished, and a
   wonderful blow will be given to the kingdom of darkness by this work,
   if it do not miscarry through the fault of the ministers themselves.
   The main danger arises from the want either of diligence, or of skill.
   Of the former, I have spoken much already. As to the latter, I am so
   conscious of my own unskilfulness, that I am far from imagining that I
   am fit to give directions to any but the younger and more inexperienced
   of the ministry; and, therefore, I expect so much justice in your
   interpretation of what I say, as that you will suppose me now to speak
   to none but such. But yet something I shall say, and not pass over this
   part in silence, because the number of such is so great; and I am
   apprehensive that the welfare of the Church and nation doth so much
   depend on the right management of this work.

   The points as to which you need to be solicitous, are these two:

   1. To bring your people to submit to this course of private catechizing
   or instruction; for, if they will not come to you, or allow you to come
   to them, what good can they receive?

   2. To do the work in such a way as will most tend to the success of it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    ARTICLE 1

   I am first to give you some directions for bringing your people to
   submit to this course of catechizing and instruction.

   1. The chief means of all is this, for a minister so to conduct himself
   in the general course of his life and ministry, as to convince his
   people of his ability, sincerity, and unfeigned love to them. For if
   they take him to be ignorant, they will despise his teaching, and think
   themselves as wise as he; and if they think him self-seeking, or
   hypocritical, and one that doth not mean as he saith, they will suspect
   all he says and does for them, and will not regard him. Whereas, if
   they are convinced that he understandeth what he doth, and have high
   thoughts of his abilities, they will reverence him, and the more easily
   stoop to his advice; and when they are persuaded of his uprightness,
   they will the less suspect his motions; and when they perceive that he
   intendeth no private ends of his own, but merely their good, they will
   the more readily be persuaded by him. And because those to whom I write
   are supposed to be none of the ablest ministers, and may therefore
   despair of being reverenced for their parts, I would say to them, you
   have the more need to study and labor for their increase; and that
   which you want in ability, must be made up in other qualifications, and
   then your advice may be as successful as others.

   If ministers were content to purchase an interest in the affections of
   their people at the dearest rates to their own flesh, and would
   condescend to them, and be familiar, and affectionate, and prudent in
   their carriage, and abound, according to their ability, in good works,
   they might do much more with their people than ordinarily they do; not
   that we should much regard an interest in them for our own sakes, but
   that we may be more capable of promoting the interest of Christ, and of
   furthering their salvation. Were it not for their own sakes, it were no
   great matter whether they love or hate us; but what commander can do
   any great service with an army that hates him? And how can we think
   that they will much regard our counsel, while they abhor or disregard
   the persons that give it them? Labour, therefore, for some competent
   interest in the estimation and affection of your people, and then you
   may the better prevail with them. But perhaps some will say, What
   should a minister do who finds he hath lost the affections of his
   people? To this I answer, If they be so vile a people, that they hate
   him not for any weakness, or misconduct of his, but merely for
   endeavoring their good, and would hate any other that should do his
   duty; then must he with patience and meekness continue to instruct
   those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them
   repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth.' But if it be on account
   of any weakness of his, or difference about lesser opinions, or
   prejudice against his own person, let him first try to remove the
   prejudice by all lawful means; and if he cannot, let him say to them,
   It is not for myself, but for you that I labor; and therefore, seeing
   that you will not obey the Word from me, I desire that you will agree
   to accept of some other that may do you that good which I cannot,' and
   so leave them, and try whether another man may not be fitter for them,
   and he fitter for another people. For an ingenuous man can hardly stay
   with a people against their wills; and a sincere man can still more
   hardly, for any benefit of his own, remain in a place where he is like
   to be unprofitable, and to hinder the good which they might receive
   from another man, who hath the advantage of a greater interest in their
   affection and esteem. 2. Supposing this general preparation, the next
   thing to be done is, to use the most effectual means to convince them
   of the benefit and necessity of this course to their own souls. The way
   to win the consent of people to anything that you propose, is to prove
   that it is good and profitable for them. You must therefore preach to
   them some powerful convincing sermons to this purpose before hand, and
   show them the benefit and necessity of the knowledge of divine truths
   in general, and of knowing the first principles in particular; and that
   the aged have the same duty and need as others, and in some respects
   much more: e. g. from Hebrews 5:12: For when for the time ye ought to
   be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first
   principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of
   milk and not of strong meat,' which affordeth us many observations
   suitable to our present object:

   As,

   (1) That God's oracles must be a man's lessons.

   (2) Ministers must teach these, and people must learn them from them.

   (3) The oracles of God have some fundamental principles, which all must
   know who wish to be saved.

   (4) These principles must be first learned: that is the right order.

   (5) It may be reasonably expected that people should thrive in
   knowledge, according to the means of instruction which they possess;
   and if they do not, it is their great sin.

   (6) If any have lived long in the church, under the means of knowledge,
   and yet are ignorant of these first principles, they have need to be
   yet taught them, how old soever they may be.

   All this is plain from the text; whence we have a fair opportunity, by
   many clear convincing reasons, to show them: First, The necessity of
   knowing God's oracles. Secondly, And more especially of knowing the
   fundamental principles. Thirdly, And particularly for the aged, who
   have sinfully lost so much time already, and have so long promised to
   repent when they were old; who should be teachers of the young, and
   whose ignorance is a double sin and shame; who have now so little time
   in which to learn, and are so near to death and judgment; and who have
   souls to save or lose as well as others. Convince them how impossible
   it is to go the way to heaven without knowing it, when there are so
   many difficulties and enemies in the way; and when men cannot do their
   worldly business without knowledge, nor learn a trade without an
   apprenticeship. Convince them what a contradiction it is to be a
   Christian, and yet to refuse to learn; for what is a Christian but a
   disciple of Christ? And how can he be a disciple of Christ, that
   refuseth to be taught by him? And he that refuseth to be taught by his
   ministers, refuseth to be taught by him; for Christ will not come down
   from heaven again to teach them by his own mouth, but hath appointed
   his ministers to keep school and teach them under him. To say,
   therefore, that they will not be taught by his ministers, is to say,
   they will not be taught by Christ; and that is to say, they will not be
   his disciples, or no Christians.

   Make them understand that it is not an arbitrary business of our own
   devising and imposing; but that necessity is laid upon us, and that if
   we look not to every member of the flock according to our ability, they
   may perish in their iniquity; but their blood will be required at our
   hand. Show them that it is God, and not we, who is the contriver and
   imposer of the work; and that therefore they blame God more than us in
   accusing it. Ask them, would they be so cruel to their minister as to
   wish him to cast away his own soul, knowingly and wilfully, for fear of
   troubling them by trying to hinder their damnation? Acquaint them fully
   with the nature of the ministerial office, and the Church's need of it;
   how it consisteth in teaching and guiding all the flock; and that, as
   they must come to the congregation, as scholars to school, so must they
   be content to give an account of what they have learned, and to be
   further instructed, man by man. Let them know what a tendency this hath
   to their salvation, what a profitable improvement it will be of their
   time, and how much vanity and evil it will prevent. And when they once
   find that it is for their own good, they will the more easily yield to
   it.

   3. When this is done, it will be very necessary that we give one of the
   catechisms to every family in the parish, whether rich or poor, that so
   they may be without excuse: for if you leave it to themselves to buy
   them, perhaps the half of them will not get them; whereas, when they
   have copies put into their hands, the receiving of them will be a kind
   of engagement to learn them; and if they do but read the exhortation
   (as it is likely they will), it will perhaps convince them and incite
   them to submit. As to the delivery of them, the best way is for the
   minister first to give notice in the congregation, that they shall be
   brought to their houses, and then to go himself from house to house and
   deliver them, and take the opportunity of persuading them to the work;
   and, as he goes round, to take a list of all the persons who have come
   to years of discretion in the several families, that he may know whom
   he has to take care of and instruct, and whom he has to expect when it
   cometh to their turn. I have formerly, in distributing some other books
   among my people, desired every family to call for them; but I found
   more confusion and uncertainty in that way, and now adopt this as the
   better method. But in small congregations, either way may do.

   As to the expense of the catechisms, if the minister be able, it will
   be well for him to bear it: if not, the best affected of his people of
   the richer sort should bear it among them. Or, on a day of humiliation,
   in preparation for the work, let the collection that is made for the
   poor be employed in buying catechisms, and the people be desired to be
   more liberal than ordinary; and what is wanting, the well-affected to
   the work may make up.

   As to the order of proceeding, it will be necessary that we take the
   people in order, family by family, beginning a month or six weeks after
   the delivery of the catechisms, that they may have time to learn them.
   And thus, taking them together in common, they will be the more willing
   to come, and the backward will be the more ashamed to keep off.

   4. Be sure that you deal gently with them, and take off all
   discouragements as effectually as you can.

   (1) Tell them publicly, that if they have learned any other catechism
   already, you will not urge them to learn this, unless they desire it
   themselves: for the substance of all catechisms that are orthodox is
   the same; only that your reason for offering them this was its brevity
   and fullness that you might give them as much as possible in few words,
   and so make their work more easy. Or, if any of them would rather learn
   some other catechism, let them have their choice.

   (2) As for the old people who are of weak memories, and not likely to
   live long in the world, and who complain that they cannot remember the
   words; tell them that you do not expect them to perplex their minds
   overmuch about it, but to hear it often read over, and to see that they
   understand it, and to get the matter into their minds and hearts; and
   then they may be borne with, though they remember not the words.

   (3) Let your dealing with those you begin with be so gentle,
   convincing, and winning, that the report of it may be an encouragement
   to others to come.

   5. Lastly, If all this will not serve to bring any particular persons
   to submit, do not cast them off; but go to them and expostulate with
   them, and learn what their reasons are, and convince them of the
   sinfulness and danger of their neglect of the help that is offered
   them. A soul is so precious that we should not lose one for want of
   labor, but follow them while there is any hope, and not give them up as
   desperate, till there be no remedy. Before we give them over, let us
   try the utmost, that we may have the experience of their obstinate
   contempt, to warrant our forsaking them. Charity beareth and waiteth
   long.
     __________________________________________________________________

    ARTICLE 2

   Having used these means to procure them to come and submit to your
   instructions, we are next to consider how you may deal most effectually
   with them in the work. And again I must say, that I think it an easier
   matter by far to compose and preach a good sermon, than to deal rightly
   with an ignorant man for his instruction in the more essential
   principles of religion. As much as this work is contemned by some, I
   doubt not it will try the gifts and spirit of ministers, and show you
   the difference between one man and another, more fully than preaching
   will do. And here I shall, as fitting my purpose, transcribe the words
   of a most learned, orthodox, and godly man, Archbishop Ussher, in his
   sermon before King James at Wanstead on Ephesians 4:13: Your Majesty's
   care can never be sufficiently commended, in taking order that the
   chief heads of the catechism should, in the ordinary ministry, be
   diligently propounded and explained unto the people throughout the
   land; which I wish were as duly executed every where, as it was piously
   by you intended. Great scholars possibly may think, that it standeth
   not so well with their credit to stoop thus low, and to spend so much
   of their time in teaching these rudiments and first principles of the
   doctrine of Christ; but they should consider, that the laying of the
   foundation skilfully, as it is the matter of greatest importance in the
   whole building, so is it the very masterpiece of the wisest-building.
   "According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
   master-builder, I have laid the foundation," saith the great apostle.
   And let the most learned of us all try it whenever we please, we shall
   find, that to lay this groundwork rightly, (that is, to apply ourselves
   to the capacity of the common auditory, and to make an ignorant man to
   understand these mysteries in some good measure) will put us to the
   trial of our skill, and trouble us a great deal more, than if we were
   to discuss a controversy, or handle a subtle point of learning in the
   schools. Yet Christ did give as well his apostles, and prophets, and
   evangelists, as his ordinary pastors and teachers, to bring us all,
   both learned and unlearned, unto the unity of this faith and knowledge;
   and the neglecting of this is the frustrating of the whole work of the
   ministry. For, let us preach never so many sermons to the people, our
   labor is but lost, as long as the foundation is unlaid, and the first
   principles untaught, upon which all other doctrine must be builded.'

   The directions which I think it necessary to give for the right
   managing of the work, are the following:

   1. When your people come to you, one family or more, begin with a brief
   preface, to mollify their minds and to take off all offense,
   unwillingness, or discouragement, and to prepare them for receiving
   your instructions. My friends,' you may say, it may perhaps seem to
   some of you an unusual and a troublesome business that I put you upon;
   but I hope you will not think it needless: for if I had thought so, I
   would have spared both you and myself this labor. But my conscience
   hath told me, yea, God hath told me in his Word, so solemnly, what it
   is to have the charge of souls, and how the blood of them that perish
   will be required at the hands of a minister that neglecteth them, that
   I dare not be guilty of it as I have hitherto been. Alas! all our
   business in this world is to get well to heaven; and God hath appointed
   us to be guides to his people, to help them safe thither. If this be
   well done, all is done; and if this be not done, we are for ever
   undone. The Lord knows how short a time you and I may be together; and
   therefore it concerns us to do what we can for our own and your
   salvation before we leave you, or you leave the world. All other
   business in the world is but as toys and dreams in comparison of this.
   The labors of your calling are but to prop up a cottage of clay, while
   your souls are hastening to death and judgment, which may even now be
   near at hand. I hope, therefore, you will be glad of help in so needful
   a work, and not think it much that I put you to this trouble, when the
   trifles of the world cannot be got without much greater trouble.' This,
   or something to this purpose, may tend to make them more willing to
   hear you, and receive instruction, and to give you some account of
   their knowledge and practice.

   2. When you have spoken thus to them all, take them one by one, and
   deal with them as far as you can in private, out of the hearing of the
   rest; for some cannot speak freely before others, and some will not
   endure to be questioned before others, because they think that it will
   tend to their shame to have others hear their answers; and some persons
   that can make better answers themselves, will be ready, when they are
   gone, to talk of what they heard, and to disgrace those that speak not
   so well as themselves; and so people will be discouraged, and persons
   who are backward to the exercise, will have pretences to forbear and
   forsake it, and to say, They will not come to be made a scorn and a
   laughingstock.' You must, therefore, be very careful to prevent all
   these inconveniences. But the main reason is, as I find by experience,
   people will better take plain close dealing about their sin, and
   misery, and duty, when you have them alone, than they will before
   others; and, if you have not an opportunity to set home the truth, and
   to deal freely with their consciences, you will frustrate all. If,
   therefore, you have a convenient place, let the rest stay in one room,
   while you confer with each person by himself in another room; only, in
   order to avoid scandal, we must speak to the women only in presence of
   some others; and, if we lose some advantage by this there is no remedy.
   It is better to do so, than, by giving occasion of reproach to the
   malicious, to destroy all the work. Yet we may so contrive it, that,
   though some others be in the room, yet what things are less fit for
   their observance may be spoken in a low voice that they may not hear
   it; and therefore they may be placed at the remotest part of the room;
   or, at least, let none be present but the members of the same family,
   who are more familiar with each other, and not so likely to reproach
   one another. And then, in your most rousing examinations and reproofs,
   deal most with the ignorant, secure, and vicious, that you may have the
   clearer ground for your close dealing, and the hearing of it may awaken
   the bystanders, to whom you seem not so directly to apply it. These
   small things deserve attention, because they are in order to a work
   that is not small; and small errors may hinder a great deal of good.

   3. Begin your work by taking an account of what they have learned of
   the words of the catechism, and receiving their answer to each
   question; and, if they are able to repeat but little or none of it, try
   whether they can rehearse the creed and the decalogue.

   4. Then choose out some of the weightiest points, and try, by further
   questions, how far they understand them. And therein be careful of the
   following things:

   (1) That you do not begin with less necessary points, but with those
   which they themselves may perceive most nearly concern them. For
   example: What do you think becomes of men when they die? What shall
   become of us after the end of the world? Do you believe that you have
   any sin; or that you were born with sin? What doth every sin deserve?
   What remedy hath God provided for the saving of sinful, miserable
   souls? Hath any one suffered for our sins in our stead; or must we
   suffer for them ourselves? Who are they that God will pardon; and who
   shall be saved by the blood of Christ? What change must be made on all
   who shall be saved; and how is this change effected? Wherein lies our
   chief happiness? And what is it that our hearts must be most set upon?'
   And such like other questions.

   (2) Beware of asking them nice, or needless, or doubtful, or very
   difficult questions, though about those matters that are of greatest
   weight in themselves. Some self-conceited persons will be as busy with
   such questions which they cannot answer themselves, and as censorious
   of the poor people that cannot answer them, as if life and death
   depended on them.

   You will ask them perhaps, What is God?': and how defective an answer
   must you make yourselves! You may tell what he is not sooner than what
   he is. If you ask, What is repentance, what faith, or what is
   forgiveness of sin'?, how many ministers may you ask before you have a
   right answer, or else they would not be so disagreed in the point!
   Likewise if you ask them what regeneration is, what sanctification is.
   But you will perhaps say, If men know not what God is, what repentance,
   faith, conversion, justification, and sanctification are, how can they
   be true Christians and be saved?'. I answer, It is one thing to know
   exactly what they are, and another thing to know them in their nature
   and effects, though with a more general and indistinct knowledge; and
   it is one thing to know, and another thing to tell what this or that
   is. The very name as commonly used doth signify to them, and express
   from them the thing without a definition; and they partly understand
   what that name signifieth, when they cannot tell it you in other words;
   as they know what it is to repent, to believe, to be forgiven. By
   custom of speech they know what these mean, and yet cannot define them,
   but perhaps put you off with the country answer: To repent is to
   repent; and to be forgiven is to be forgiven'; or if they can say, It
   is to be pardoned,' it is fair. Yet do I not absolutely dissuade you
   from the use of such questions; but do it cautiously, in case you
   suspect some gross ignorance in the point; especially about God
   himself.

   (3) So contrive your questions, that they may perceive what you mean,
   and that it is not a nice definition, but simply a solution, that you
   expect; and look not after words, but things, and even leave them to a
   bare Yes, or No, or the mere election of one of the two descriptions
   which you yourself may have propounded. For example: What is God? Is he
   made of flesh and blood, as we are; or is he an invisible Spirit? Is he
   a man, or is he not? Had he any beginning? Can he die? What is faith?
   Is it a believing all the Word of God? What is it to believe in Christ?
   Is it all one as to become a true Christian or to believe that Christ
   is the Savior of sinners, and to trust in him, as your Savior, to
   pardon, sanctify, govern, and glorify you? What is repentance? Is it
   only to be sorry for sin or is it the change of the mind from sin to
   God, and a forsaking of it? or does it include both?'

   (4) When you perceive that they do not understand the meaning of your
   question, you must draw out their answer by an equivalent, or
   expository question; or, if that will not do, you must frame the answer
   into your question, and require in reply, but Yes, or No. I have often
   asked some very ignorant people, How do you think that your sins, which
   are so many and so great, can be pardoned?' And they tell me, By their
   repenting, and amending their lives,' and never mention Jesus Christ. I
   ask them further, But do you think that your amendment can make God any
   amends or satisfaction for the sin that is past They will answer, We
   hope so, or else we know not what will?' One would now think that these
   men had no knowledge of Christ at all, since they make no mention of
   him; and some I indeed find have no knowledge of him; and when I tell
   them the history of Christ, and what he is, and did, and suffered, they
   stand wondering at it as a strange thing; and some say, They never
   heard this much before, nor knew it, though they came to church every
   Lord's day. But some, I perceive, give such answers, because they
   understand not the scope of my question; but suppose that I take
   Christ's death for granted, and that I only ask them, What shall make
   God satisfaction, as their part under Christ?' - though in this, also,
   they reveal sad ignorance. And when I ask them, Whether their good
   deeds can merit any thing from God?' they answer, No; but they hope God
   will accept them.' And if I ask further, Can you be saved without the
   death of Christ?' they say, No.' And if I ask, still further, What hath
   he done or suffered for you?' they will say, He died for us; or he shed
   his blood for us," and will profess that they place their confidence in
   that for salvation. Many men have that in their minds which is not ripe
   for utterance; and, through an imperfect education and disuse, they are
   strangers to the expression of those things of which they yet have some
   conception. And, by the way, you may here see reason why you should
   deal very tenderly with the common people for matter of knowledge and
   defect of expression, if they are teachable and tractable, and willing
   to use the means; for many, even ancient godly persons, cannot express
   themselves with any tolerable propriety, nor yet learn when expressions
   are put into their mouths. Some of the most pious, experienced,
   approved Christians that I know (aged people), complain to me, with
   tears, that they cannot learn the words of the catechism; and when I
   consider their advantages - that they have enjoyed the most excellent
   helps, in constant duty, and in the best company, for forty, fifty, or
   sixty years together - it teacheth me what to expect from poor ignorant
   people, who never had such company and converse for one year or week;
   and not to reject them so hastily as some hot and too high professors
   would have us do.

   (5) If you find them at a loss, and unable to answer your questions, do
   not drive them too hard, or too long, with question after question,
   lest they conceive you intend only to puzzle them, and disgrace them;
   but when you perceive that they cannot answer, step in yourself, and
   take the burden off them, and answer the question yourselves; and do it
   thoroughly and plainly, and give a full explanation of the whole truth
   to them, that, by your teaching, they may be brought to understand it
   before you leave them. And herein it is commonly necessary that you
   fetch up the matter from the beginning, and take it in order, till you
   come to the point in question.

   5. When you have done what you see cause in the trial of their
   knowledge, proceed next to instruct them yourselves, and this must be
   according to their several capacities. If it be a professor that
   understandeth the fundamental principles of religion, fall upon
   somewhat which you perceive that he most needeth, either explaining
   further some of the mysteries of the gospel, or laying the grounds of
   some duty which he may doubt of, or showing the necessity of what he
   neglecteth, or pointing out his sins or mistakes, as may be most
   convincing and edifying to him. If, on the other hand, it be one who is
   grossly ignorant, give him a plain, familiar recital of the sum of the
   Christian religion in a few words; for though it be in the catechism
   already, yet a more familiar way may better help him to understand it.
   Thus: You must know, that from everlasting there was one God, who had
   no beginning, and will have no end, who is not a body as we are, but a
   most pure, spiritual Being, that knoweth all things, and can do all
   things; and hath all goodness and blessedness in himself. This God is
   but one, but yet Three Persons, the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost, in
   a manner that is above our understanding. And you must know, that this
   one God did make all the world by his Word; the heavens he made to be
   the place of his glory, and a multitude of holy angels to serve him.
   But some of these did, by pride or some other sin, fall from their high
   estate, and are become devils, and shall be miserable for ever. When he
   had created the earth, he made man, as his noblest creature here below,
   even one man and one woman, Adam and Eve; and he made them perfect,
   without any sin, and put them into the garden of Eden, and forbade them
   to eat of one tree in the garden, and told them that if they ate of it
   they should die. But the devil, who had first fallen himself, did tempt
   them to sin, and they yielded to his temptation, and thus fell under
   the curse of God's law. But God, of his infinite wisdom and mercy, did
   send his own Son, Jesus Christ, to be their Redeemer, who, in the
   fullness of time, was made man, being born of a virgin, by the power of
   the Holy Ghost, and lived on earth, among the Jews, about thirty-three
   years, during which time he preached the gospel himself, and wrought
   many miracles to prove his doctrine, healing the lame, the blind, the
   sick, and raising the dead by his Divine power; and in the end he was
   offered upon the cross as a sacrifice for our sins to bear that curse
   which we should have borne.

   And now, if sinners will but believe in him, and repent of their sins,
   he will freely pardon all that is past, and will sanctify their
   corrupted nature, and will at length bring them to his heavenly kingdom
   and glory. But if they make light of their sins and of his mercy, he
   will condemn them to everlasting misery in hell. This gospel, Christ,
   having risen from the dead on the third day, appointed his ministers to
   preach to all the world; and when he had given this in charge to all
   his apostles, he ascended up into heaven, before their faces, where he
   is now in glory, with God the Father, in our nature. And at the end of
   this world, he will come again in our nature, and will raise the dead
   to life again, and bring them all before him, that they may "give an
   account of all the deeds done in the body, whether they be good, or
   whether they be evil." If, therefore, you mean to be saved, you must
   believe in Christ, as the only Savior from the wrath to come; you must
   repent of your sins; you must, in short, be wholly new creatures, or
   there will be no salvation for you.' Some such short rehearsal of the
   principles of religion, in the most familiar manner that you can
   devise, with a brief touch of application in the end, will be necessary
   when you deal with the grossly ignorant. And if you perceive they
   understand you not, go over it again, and ask them whether they
   understand it, and try to fix it in their memories.

   6. Whether they be grossly ignorant or not, if you suspect them to be
   unconverted, endeavor next to make some prudent inquiry into their
   state. The best and least offensive way of doing this will be to
   prepare them for the inquiry by saying something that may mollify their
   minds, and convince them of the necessity of the inquiry, and then to
   take occasion from some article in the catechism to touch their
   consciences. For example: You see that the Holy Ghost doth, by the
   Word, enlighten men's minds, and soften and open their hearts, and turn
   them from the power of Satan unto God through faith in Christ, and
   "purifies them unto himself a peculiar people;" and that none but these
   shall be made partakers of everlasting life. Now, though I have no
   desire, needlessly, to pry into any man's secrets, yet, because it is
   the office of ministers to give advice to their people in matters of
   salvation, and because it is so dangerous a thing to be mistaken as to
   points which involve everlasting life or everlasting death, I would
   entreat you to deal honestly, and tell me, Whether or not you ever
   found this great change upon your own heart? Did you ever find the
   Spirit of God, by the Word, come in upon your understanding, with a new
   and heavenly life, which hath made you a new creature? The Lord, who
   seeth your heart, doth know whether it be so or not; I pray you,
   therefore, see that you speak the truth.' If he tell you that he hopes
   he is converted - all are sinners - but he is sorry for his sins, or
   the like; then tell him more particularly, in a few words, of some of
   the plainest marks of true conversion, and so renew and enforce the
   inquiry, thus: Because your salvation or damnation is involved in this,
   I would fain help you a little in regard to it, that you may not be
   mistaken in a matter of such moment, but may find out the truth before
   it be too late; for as God will judge us impartially, so we have his
   Word before us, by which we may judge ourselves; for this Word tells us
   most certainly who they are that shall go to heaven, and who to hell.
   Now the Scripture tells us that the state of an unconverted man is
   this: he seeth no great felicity in the love and communion of God in
   the life to come, which may draw his heart thither from this present
   world; but he liveth to his carnal self, or to the flesh; and the main
   bent of his life is, that it may go well with him on earth; and that
   religion which he hath is but a little by the by, lest he should be
   damned when he can keep the world no longer; so that the world and the
   flesh are highest in his esteem, and nearest to his heart, and God and
   glory stand below them, and all their service of God is but a giving
   him that which the world and flesh can spare. This is the case of every
   unconverted man; and all who are in this case are in a state of misery.
   But he that is truly converted, hath had a light shining into his soul
   from God, which hath showed him the greatness of his sin and misery,
   and made it a heavy load upon his soul; and showed him what Christ is,
   and what he hath done for sinners, and made him admire the riches of
   God's grace in him. Oh, what glad news it is to him, that yet there is
   hope for such lost sinners as he; that so many and so great sins may be
   pardoned; and that pardon is offered to all who will accept of it! How
   gladly doth he entertain this message and offer! And for the time to
   come, he resigneth himself and all that he hath to Christ, to be wholly
   his, and to be disposed of by him, in order to the everlasting glory
   which he hath promised. He hath now such a sight of the blessed state
   of the saints in glory, that he despiseth all this world as dross and
   dung, in comparison of it; and there he layeth up his happiness and his
   hopes, and takes all the affairs of this life but as so many helps or
   hindrances in the way to that; so that the main care and business of
   his life is to be happy in the life to come. This is the case of all
   who are truly converted and who shall be saved. Now, is this the case
   with you, or is it not Have you experienced such a change as this upon
   your soul?'

   If he say, he hopes he hath, descend to some particulars, thus: I pray
   you then answer me these two or three questions.

   (1) Can you truly say, that all the known sins of your past life are
   the grief of your heart, and that you have felt that everlasting misery
   is due to you for them; and that, under a sense of this heavy burden,
   you have felt yourself a lost man, and have gladly entertained the news
   of a Savior, and cast your soul upon Christ alone, for pardon by his
   blood?

   (2) Can you truly say, that your heart is so far turned from sin, that
   you hate the sins which you once have loved, and love that holy life
   which you had no mind to before; and that you do not now live in the
   wilful practice of any known sin? Is there no sin which you are not
   heartily willing to forsake, whatever it cost you; and no duty which
   you are not willing to perform?

   (3) Can you truly say, that you have so far taken the everlasting
   enjoyment of God for your happiness, that it hath the most of your
   heart, of your love, desire, and care; and that you are resolved, by
   the strength of Divine grace, to let go all that you have in the world,
   rather than hazard it; and that it is your daily, and your principal
   business to seek it? Can you truly say, that though you have your
   failings and sins, yet your main care, and the bent of your whole life,
   is to please God, and to enjoy him for ever; and that you give the
   world God's leavings, as it were, and not God the world's leavings; and
   that your worldly business is but as a traveller's seeking for
   provision in his journey, and heaven is the place that you take for
   your home?'

   If he answer in the affirmative to these questions, tell him how great
   a thing it is for a man's heart to abhor his sin, and to lay up his
   happiness unfeignedly in another world; and to live in this world for
   another that is out of sight; and, therefore, desire him to see that it
   be so indeed. Then turn to some of the articles in the catechism, which
   treat of those duties which you most suspect him to omit, and ask him,
   whether he performs such or such a duty; as for instance, prayer in his
   family, or in private, and the holy spending of the Lord's day.

   I would, however, advise you to be very cautious how you pass too hasty
   or absolute censures on any you have to do with; because, it is not so
   easy a matter to discern a man to be certainly graceless, as many
   imagine it to be; and you may do the work in hand as well without such
   an absolute conclusion as with it.

   7. If, however, you have, either by former discovery of gross
   ignorance, or by these later inquiries into his spiritual state,
   discerned an apparent probability that the person is yet in an
   unconverted state, your next business is, to employ all your skill to
   bring his heart to a sense of his condition. For example: Truly, my
   friends, I have no mind, the Lord knows, to make your condition worse
   than it is, nor to occasion you any causeless fear or trouble; but, I
   suppose, you would account me a treacherous enemy, and not a faithful
   minister, if I should flatter you, and not tell you the truth. If you
   seek a physician in your sickness, you would have him tell you the
   truth, though it were the worst. Much more here! For there the
   knowledge of your disease may, by your fears, increase it; but here you
   must know it, or else you can never be recovered from it. I much fear
   that you are yet a stranger to the Christian life. For if you we're a
   Christian indeed, and truly converted, your very heart would be set on
   God and the life to come, and you would make it your chief business to
   prepare for everlasting happiness; and you durst not, you would not,
   live in any wilful sin, nor in the neglect of any known duty.

   Alas! what have you done? how have you spent your time till now Did you
   not know that you had a soul to be saved or lost; and that you must
   live in heaven or in hell for ever; and that you had your life and time
   in this world chiefly for the purpose of preparing for another? Alas!
   what have you been doing all your days that you are so ignorant, or so
   unprepared for death, if it should now find you? If you had but as much
   mind of heaven as of earth, you would have known more of it, and done
   more for it, and inquired more diligently after it, than you have done.
   You can learn how to do your business in the world; and why could you
   not learn more of the will of God, if you had but attended to it? You
   have neighbors that could learn more, that have had as much to do in
   the world as you, and who have had as little time. Do you think that
   heaven is not worth your labor? or that it can be had without any care
   or pains, when you cannot have the trifles of this world without them,
   and when God hath bid you seek first his kingdom and the righteousness
   thereof? Alas! my friends, what if you had died before this hour in an
   unconverted state? what then had become of you, and where had you now
   been? Alas! that you were so cruel to yourselves as to venture your
   everlasting state so desperately as you have done! What did you think
   of? Did you not all this while know that you must shortly die, and be
   judged as you were then found? Had you any greater work to do, or any
   greater business to mind, than your everlasting salvation? Do you think
   that all that you can get in this world will comfort you in a dying
   hour, or purchase your salvation, or ease the pains of hell?'

   Set these things home with a peculiar earnestness; for if you get not
   to the heart, you do little or nothing; and that which affecteth not is
   soon forgotten.

   8. Conclude the whole with a practical exhortation, which must contain
   two parts; first, the duty of believing in Christ; and secondly, of
   using the external means of grace for the time to come, and the
   avoiding of former sins. For example: My friend, I am heartily sorry to
   find you in so sad a case, but I should be more sorry to leave you in
   it, and therefore let me entreat you, for the Lord's sake, and for your
   own sake, to regard what I shall say to you, as to the time to come. It
   is of the Lord's great mercy that he did not cut you off in your
   unconverted state, and that you have yet life and time, and that there
   is a remedy provided for you in the blood of Christ, and that pardon
   and sanctification and everlasting life are offered to you as well as
   to others. God hath not left sinful man to utter destruction, as he
   hath done the devils; nor hath he made any exception in the offer of
   pardon and eternal life against you any more than against any other.

   If you had yet but a bleeding heart for sin, and could come to Christ
   believingly for recovery, and resign yourself to him as your Savior and
   Lord, and would be a new man for the time to come, the Lord would have
   mercy on you in the pardon of your sins, and the everlasting salvation
   of your soul. And I must tell you that, as it must be the great work of
   God's grace to give you such a heart, so if ever he mean to pardon and
   save you, he will make this change upon you; he will make you feel your
   sin as the heaviest burden in the world, as that which is most odious
   in itself, and hath rendered you liable to his wrath and curse; he will
   make you see that you are a lost man, and that there is nothing for you
   but everlasting damnation, unless you are pardoned by the blood of
   Christ, and sanctified by his Spirit; he will make you see the need you
   have of Christ, and how all your hope and life is in him; he will make
   you see the vanity of this world and all that it can afford you, and
   that all your happiness is with God, in that everlasting life in
   heaven, where you may, with the saints and angels, behold his glory,
   and live in his love, and be employed in his praises. Let me tell you
   that, till this work be done upon you, you are a miserable man; and if
   you die before it is done, you are lost for ever. Now you have hope and
   help before you, but then there will be none.

   Let me therefore entreat you, as you love your soul, First, That you
   will not rest in the condition in which you at present are. Be not
   quiet in your mind till a saving change is wrought in your heart.
   Think, when you rise in the morning, Oh, what if this day should be my
   last, and death should find me in an unrenewed state? Think, when you
   are about your labor, Oh, how much greater a work have I yet to do, to
   get my soul reconciled to God, and sanctified by his Spirit! Think,
   when you are eating, or drinking, or looking on anything that you
   possess in the world, What good will all this do me, if I live and die
   an enemy to God, and a stranger to Christ and his Spirit, and so perish
   for ever? Let these thoughts be day and night upon your mind till your
   soul be changed. Secondly, I entreat you to bethink yourself seriously
   what a vain world this is, and how shortly it will leave you to a cold
   grave, and to everlasting misery, if you have not a better treasure
   than it. And consider what it is to live in the presence of God, and to
   reign with Christ, and be like the angels; and that this is the life
   that Christ hath procured you, and is preparing for you, and offereth
   you, if you will only accept of it; and oh think, whether it be not
   madness to slight such an endless glory, and to prefer these fleshly
   dreams and earthly shadows before it. Accustom yourself to such
   considerations as these when you are alone, and let them dwell upon
   your mind. Thirdly, I entreat, that you will presently, without any
   more delay, accept of this felicity, and this Savior. Close with the
   Lord Jesus that offereth you this eternal life: joyfully and thankfully
   accept his offer as the only way to make you happy: and then you may
   believe that all your sins will be done away by him. Fourthly, Resolve
   presently against your former sins; find out what hath defiled your
   heart and life, and cast it from you, as you would do poison out of
   your stomach, and abhor the thought of taking it again.

   My last request to you is, that you will set yourself to the diligent
   use of the means of grace till this change be wrought, and then
   continue the use of these means till you are confirmed, and at last
   perfected.

   (1) As you cannot of yourself effect this change upon your heart and
   life, betake yourself daily to God in prayer, and beg earnestly, as for
   your life, that he will pardon all your sins, and change your heart,
   and show you the riches of his grace in Christ, and the glory of his
   kingdom. Follow God day and night with these requests.

   (2) Fly from temptations and occasions of sin, and forsake your former
   evil company, and betake yourself to the company of those that fear
   God, and will help you in the way to heaven.

   (3) Be specially careful to spend the Lord's day in holy exercises,
   both public and private, and lose not one quarter of an hour of any of
   your time; but especially of that most precious time which God hath
   given you purposely, that you may set your mind upon him, and be
   instructed by him, and prepare yourself for your latter end. What say
   you to these things? Will you do this presently, or at least so much of
   it as you can? Will you give me a promise to this effect, and study
   henceforth to keep that promise?'

   And here be sure, if you can, to get their promise, and engage them to
   amendment, especially to use the means of grace, and to change their
   company, and to forsake their sins, because these are more within their
   reach; and in this way they may wait for the accomplishing of that
   change that is not yet wrought. And do this solemnly, reminding them of
   the presence of God who heareth their promises, and who will expect the
   performance of them; and when you afterward have opportunity, you may
   remind them of their promise.

   9. At the dismissing of them, do these two things:

   (1) Mollify their minds again by a few words, deprecating anything like
   offense. For example: I pray you, take it not ill that I have put you
   to this trouble, or dealt thus freely with you. It is as little
   pleasure to me as to you. If I did not know these things to be true and
   necessary, I would have spared this labor to myself and you; but I know
   that we shall be here together but a little while: We are almost at the
   world to come already; and therefore it is time for us all to look
   about us, and see that we be ready when God shall call us.'

   (2) As you may not soon have an opportunity to speak with the same
   persons, set them in the way of perfecting what you have begun. Engage
   the master of each family to call all his family to repeat, every
   Lord's day, what they have learned of the catechism; and to continue
   this practice till they have all learned it perfectly: and when they
   have done so, still to continue to hear them regularly recite it, that
   they may not forget it; for, even to the most judicious, it will be an
   excellent help to have in memory a Sum of the Christian Religion, as to
   matter, method, and words.

   As to the rulers of families themselves, or those that are under such
   masters as will not help them, if they have learned some part of the
   catechism only, engage them either to come again to you (though before
   their course) when they have learned the rest, or else to go to some
   able experienced neighbor, and repeat it to him; and do you take the
   assistance of such persons, when you cannot have time yourself.

   10. Have the names of all your parishioners by you in a book; and when
   they come and repeat the catechism, note in your book who come, and who
   do not; and who are so grossly ignorant as to be unfit for the Lord's
   supper and other holy communion, and who not: and as you perceive the
   necessities of each, so deal with them for the future. But as to those
   that are utterly obstinate, and will not come to you, nor be instructed
   by you, deal with them as the obstinate despisers of instruction should
   be dealt with, in regard to sealing and confirming ordinances; which
   is, to avoid them, and not to hold holy or familiar communion with them
   in the Lord's supper or other ordinances. And though some reverend
   brethren are for admitting their children to baptism (and offended with
   me for contradicting it), yet so cannot I, nor shall I dare to do it
   upon any pretences of their ancestors' faith, or of a dogmatical faith
   of these rebellious parents.

   11. Through the whole course of your conference with them, see that the
   manner as well as the matter be suited to the end.

   And concerning the manner observe these particulars:

   (1) That you make a difference according to the character of the
   persons whom you have to deal with. To the youthful, you must lay
   greater shame on sensual voluptuousness, and show them the nature and
   necessity of mortification. To the aged, you must do more to disgrace
   this present world, and make them apprehensive of the nearness of their
   change, and the aggravations of their sin, if they shall live and die
   in ignorance or impenitency. To inferiors and the young, you must be
   more free; to superiors and elders, more reverend. To the rich, you
   must show the vanity of this world; and the nature and necessity of
   self-denial; and the damnableness of preferring the present state to
   the next; together with the necessity of improving their talents in
   doing good to others. To the poor, you must show the great riches of
   glory which are offered to them in the gospel, and how well present
   comfort may be spared when everlasting joy may be got. Those sins must
   also be most insisted on which each one's age, or sex, or temperament,
   or calling and employment in the world, doth most incline them to; as
   in females, loquacity, evil speeches, passion, malice, pride; in males,
   drunkenness, ambition, etc.

   (2) Be as condescending, familiar, and plain as possible, with those
   that are of weaker capacity.

   (3) Give them Scripture proof of all you say, that they may see that it
   is not you only, but God by you that speaketh to them.

   (4) Be as serious as you can in the whole exercise, but especially in
   the applicatory part. I scarce fear anything more, than that some
   careless ministers will slubber over the work, and do all superficially
   and without life, and destroy this as they do all other duties, by
   turning it into a mere formality; putting a few cold questions to their
   people, and giving them two or three cold words of advice, without any
   life and feeling in themselves, and not likely to produce any feeling
   in the hearers. But surely he that valueth souls, and knoweth what an
   opportunity is before him, will go through the exercise with deep
   seriousness, and will be as earnest with them as for life or death.

   (5) To this end, I should think it very necessary that, both before and
   in the work, we take special pains with our own hearts, to excite and
   strengthen our belief of the truth of the gospel, and of the invisible
   glory and misery that are to come. I am confident this work will
   exceedingly try the strength of our belief. For he that is but
   superficially a Christian, and not sound at bottom, will likely feel
   his zeal quite fail him, especially when the duty is grown common, for
   want of a belief of the things of which he is to treat. An affected
   hypocritical fervency will not hold out long in duties of this kind. A
   pulpit shall have more of it, than a conference with poor ignorant
   souls. For the pulpit is the hypocritical minister's stage: there, and
   in the press, and in other public acts, where there is room for
   ostentation, you shall have his best, perhaps his all. It is other kind
   of men that must effectually do the work now in hand.

   (6) It is, therefore, very meet that we prepare ourselves for it by
   secret prayer; and, if time would permit, and there be many together,
   it were well if we began and ended with a short prayer with our people.

   (7) Carry on all, even the most earnest passages, with clear
   demonstrations of love to their souls, and make them feel through the
   whole, that you aim at nothing but their salvation. Avoid all harsh,
   discouraging language.

   (8) If you have not time to deal so fully with each individual as is
   here directed, then omit not the most necessary parts. Take several of
   them together who are friends, and who will not seek to divulge each
   other's weaknesses, and speak to them in common as much as concerneth
   all. Only the examinations of their knowledge and state, and of their
   convictions of sin and misery, and special directions to them, must be
   used to the individuals alone; but take heed of slubbering it over with
   an unfaithful laziness, or by being too brief, without a real
   necessity.

   12. Lastly, If God enable you, extend your charity to those of the
   poorest sort, before they part from you. Give them somewhat towards
   their relief and for the time that is thus taken from their labors,
   especially for the encouragement of them that do best. And to the rest,
   promise them so much when they have learned the catechism. I know you
   cannot give what you have not, but I speak to them that can. And now,
   brethren, I have done with my advice, and leave you to the practice.
   Though the proud may receive it with scorn, and the selfish and
   slothful with distaste, or even indignation, I doubt not but God will
   use it, in despite of the opposition of sin and Satan, to the awakening
   of many of his servants to their duty, and the promoting of the work of
   a right reformation; and that his blessing will accompany the present
   undertaking, for the saving of many a soul, the peace of you that
   undertake and perform it, the exciting of his servants throughout the
   nation to second you, and the increase of the purity and the unity of
   his churches. Amen
