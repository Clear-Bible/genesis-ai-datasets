PUBLISHER'S ADVERTISEMENT.

   In this little volume we reprint, with consent of the Author, the tenth
   chapter of his Treatise, Nature and the Supernatural.

   This chapter, taken as a sketch of the self-evidencing, superhuman
   character of Christ, has attracted much attention; and we have
   solicited, many times over, in the various notices and reviews of the
   book, as well as by private readers, to give it to the public by
   itself. This, too, we do more readily, that it makes a complete whole
   by itself, and is in a style to be read by multitudes who probably will
   not undertake to master the more elaborate and difficult argument, of
   which it is only a subordinate member.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE

                              CHARACTER OF JESUS.

   IT is the grand peculiarity of the sacred writings, that they deal in
   supernatural events and transactions, and show the fact of a celestial
   institution finally erected on earth, which is fitly called the kingdom
   of God; because it shows Him reigning, an a Regenerator and Restorer of
   the broken order of the world. Christianity is, in this view, no mere
   scheme of doctrine, or of ethical practice, but is instead a kind of
   miracle, a power out of nature and above, descending into it; a
   historically supernatural movement on the world, Gat is visibly entered
   into it, and organized to be an institution in the person of Jesus
   Christ He, therefore, is the central figure and power, and with him the
   entire fabric either stands or falls.

   To this central figure, then, we now turn ourselves; and, as no proof
   beside the light is necessary to show that the sun shines, so we shall
   find that Jesus proves himself by his own self-evidence. The simple
   inspection of his life and character will suffice to show that he
   cannot be classified with mankind (man though he be), any more than
   what we call his miracles can be classified with mere natural events.
   The simple demonstrations of his life and spirit are the sufficient
   attestation of his own profession, when he says--"I am from above"--"I
   came down from heaven."

   We assume nothing reported of him to be true. Let us not be
   misunderstood. We do not assume the truth of the narrative by which the
   manner and facts of the life of Jesus are reported to us; for this, by
   the supposition, is the matter in question. We only assume the
   representations themselves, as being just what they are, and discover
   their necessary truth, in the transcendent, wondrously self-evident,
   picture of divine excellence and beauty exhibited in them. We take up
   the account of Christ, in the New Testament, just as we would any other
   ancient writing, or as if it were a manuscript just brought to light in
   some ancient library. We open the book, and discover in it four
   biographies of a certain remarkable character, called Jesus Christ. He
   is miraculously born of Mary, a virgin of Galilee, and declares
   himself, without scruple, that he came out from God. Finding the
   supposed history made up, in great part, of his mighty acts, and not
   being disposed to believe in miracles and marvels, we should soon
   dismiss the book as a tissue of absurdities too extravagant for belief,
   were we not struck with the souse of something very peculiar in the
   character of this remarkable person. Having our attention arrested thus
   by the impression made on our respect, we are put on inquiry, and the
   more we study it, the more wonderful, as a character, it appears. And
   before we have done, it becomes, in fact, the chief wonder of the
   story; lifting all the other wonders into order and intelligent
   proportion round it, and making one compact and glorious wonder of the
   whole picture; a picture shining in its own clear sunlight upon us, as
   the truest of all truths--Jesus, the Divine Word, coming out from God,
   to be incarnate with us, and be the vehicle of God and salvation to the
   race.

   On the single question, therefore, of the more than human character of
   Jesus, we propose, in perfect confidence, to rest a principal argument
   for Christianity as a supernatural institution; for, if there be in
   Jesus a character which is not human, then has something broken into
   the world that is not of it, and the spell of unbelief is broken.

   Not that Christianity might not be a supernatural institution, if Jesus
   were only a man; for many prophets and holy men, as we believe, have
   brought forth to the world communications that are not from themselves,
   but were received by inspirations from God. There are several grades,
   too, of the supernatural, as already intimated; the supernatural human,
   the supernatural prophetic, the supernatural demonic and angelic, the
   supernatural divine. Christ, we shall see, is the supernatural
   manifested in the highest grade or order; viz., the divine.

   The only character that has a perfect youth. We observe, then, as a
   first peculiarity at the root of his character, that he begins life
   with a perfect youth. His childhood is an unspotted, and, withal, a
   kind of celestial flower. The notion of a superhuman or celestial
   childhood, the most difficult of all things to be conceived, is yet
   successfully drawn by a few simple touches. He is announced beforehand
   as "that Holy Thing"; a beautiful and powerful stroke, to raise our
   expectation to the level of a nature so mysterious. In his childhood,
   everybody loves him. Using words of external description, he is shown
   growing up in favor with God and man, a child so lovely and beautiful,
   that heaven and earth appear to smile upon him together. So, when it is
   added that the child grew and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
   wisdom, and, more than all, that the grace or beautifying power of God
   was upon him, we look, as on the unfolding of a sacred flower, and seem
   to scent a fragrance wafted on us from other worlds. Then, at the age
   of twelve, he is found among the great learned men of the day, the
   doctors of the temple, hearing what they my, and asking them question.
   And this, without any word that indicates forwardness or pertness in
   the child's manner, such as some Christian Rabbi, or silly and
   credulous devotee, would certainly have added. The doctors are not
   offended, as by a child too forward or wanting in modesty; they are
   only amazed that such a degree of understanding eau dwell in one so
   young and simple. His mother finds him there among them, and begins to
   expostulate with him. His reply is very strange; it must, she is sure,
   have some deep meaning that corresponds with his mysterious birth, and
   the sense he has ever given her of a something strangely peculiar in
   his ways; and she goes home keeping his saying in her heart, and
   guessing vainly what his thought may be. Mysterious, holy secret! which
   this mother hides in her bosom; that her holy thing, her child whom she
   has watched, during the twelve years of his celestial childhood, now
   begins to speak of being "about his Father's business," in words of
   dark enigma, which she can not fathom.

   The picture stands by itself. Now we do not say, observe, that there is
   one word of truth in these touches of narrative. We only my that,
   whether they be fact or fiction, here is given the sketch of a perfect
   and sacred childhood, not of a simple, lovely, ingenuous, and properly
   human childhood, such as the poets love to sketch, but of a sacred and
   celestial childhood. In this respect, the early character of Jesus is a
   picture that stands by itself. In no other case, that we remember, has
   it ever entered the mind of a biographer, in drawing a character, to
   represent it as beginning with a spot-lees childhood. The childhood of
   the great human characters, if given at all, is commonly represented,
   according to the uniform truth, as being more or lees contrary to the
   manner of their mature age; and never as being strictly one with it,
   except in those cases of inferior eminence whom the kind of distinction
   attained to is that of some mere prodigy, and not a character of
   greatness in action, or of moral excellence. In all the higher ranges
   of character, the excellence portrayed is never the simple unfolding of
   a harmonious and perfect beauty contained in the germ of childhood, but
   it is a character formed by a process of rectification, in which many
   follies are mended and distempers removed; in which confidence is
   checked by defeat, passion moderated by reason, smartness sobered by
   experience. Commonly a certain pleasure is taken in showing how the
   many wayward sallies of the boy are, at length, reduced by discipline
   to the character of wisdom, justice, and public heroism, so much
   admired.

   Besides, if any writer, of almost any age, will undertake to describe,
   not merely a spotless, but a superhuman or celestial childhood, not
   having the reality before him, he must be somewhat more than human
   himself, if he does not pile together a mass of clumsy exaggerations,
   and draw and overdraw, till neither heaven nor earth can find any
   verisimilitude in the picture.

   The absurd pictures given of infant prodigies. Neither let us omit to
   notice what ideas the Rabbis and learned doctors of this age were able,
   in fact, to furnish, when setting forth a remarkable childhood. Thus
   Josephus, drawing on the teachings of the Rabbis, tells how the infant
   Moses, when the king of Egypt took him out of his daughter's arms, and
   playfully put the diadem on his head, threw it pettishly down and
   stamped on it. And when Moses was three years old, he tells us that the
   child had grown so tall, and exhibited such a wonderful beauty of
   countenance, that people were obliged, as it were, to stop and look at
   him as he was carried along the road, and were held fast by the wonder,
   gazing till he was out of sight. See, too, what work in made of the
   childhood of Jesus himself, in the Apocryphal gospels. These are
   written by men of so nearly the same era, that we may discover, in
   their embellishments, what kind of a childhood it was in the mere
   invention of the time to make out. While the gospels explicitly say
   that Jesus wrought no miracles till his public ministry began, and that
   he made his beginning in the miracle of Cana, these are ambitious to
   make him a great prodigy in his childhood. They tell how, on one
   occasion, he pursued in his anger, the other children, who refused to
   play with him, and turned them into kids; how, on another, when a child
   accidentally ran against him, he was angry, and killed him by his mere
   word; how, on another, Jesus had a dispute with his teacher over the
   alphabet, and when the teacher struck him, how he crushed him, withered
   his arm, and threw him down dead. Finally, Joseph tells Mary that they
   must keep him within doors, for everybody perishes against whom he is
   excited. His mother sends him to the well for water, and having broken
   his pitcher, he brings the water in his cloak. He goes into a dyer's
   shop, when the dyer is out, and throws all the cloths he finds into a
   vat of one color; but, when they are taken out, behold, they are all
   dyed of the precise color that was ordered. He commands a palm-tree to
   stoop down and let him pluck the fruit, and it obeys. When he is
   carried down into Egypt, all the idols fall down wherever he passes,
   and the lions and leopards gather round him in a harmless company. This
   the Gospel of the Infancy gives, as a picture of the wonderful
   childhood of Jesus. How unlike that holy flower of paradise, in the
   true gospels, which a few simple touches make to bloom in beautiful
   self-evidence before us!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jesus the only great character that holds a footing of innocence.
   Passing now to the character of Jesus in his maturity, we discover, at
   once, that there is an element in it which distinguishes it from all
   human characters, viz., innocence. By this we mean, not that he is
   actually sinless; that will be denied, and, therefore, must not be
   assumed. We mean that, viewed externally, he is a perfectly harmless
   being, actuated by no destructive passions, gentle to inferiors, doing
   ill or injury to none. The figure of a Lamb, which never was, or could
   be applied to any of the great human characters, without an implication
   of weakness fatal to all respect, is yet, with no such effect, applied
   to him. We associate weakness with innocence, and the association is so
   powerful, that no human writer would undertake to sketch a great
   character on the basis of innocence, or would even think it possible.
   We predicate innocence of infancy; but to be a perfectly harmless,
   guileless man, never doing ill even for a moment, we consider to be the
   same as to be a man destitute of spirit and manly force. But Christ
   accomplished the impossible. Appearing in all the grandeur and majesty
   of a superhuman manhood, he is able still to unite the impression of
   innocence, with no apparent diminution of his sublimity. It is, in
   fact, the distinctive glory of his character, that it seems to be the
   natural unfolding of a divine innocence; a pure celestial childhood,
   amplified by growth. We feel the power of this strange combination, but
   we have so great difficulty in conceiving it, or holding our minds to
   the conception, that we sometimes subside or descend to the human
   level, and empty the character of Jesus of the strange element
   unawares. We read, for example, his terrible denunciations against the
   Pharisees, and are shocked by the violent, fierce sound they have on
   our mortal lips; not perceiving that the offence is in us, and not in
   him. We should suffer no such revulsion, did we only conceive them
   bursting out, as words of indignant grief, from the surcharged bosom of
   innocence; for there is nothing so bitter as the offence that innocence
   feels, when stung by hypocrisy and a sense of cruelty to the poor. So,
   when he drives the money-changers from the temple, we are likely to
   leave out the only element that saves him from a look of violence and
   passion. Whereas, it is the very point of the story, not that he, as by
   mere force, can drive so many men, but that so many are seen retiring
   before the moral power of one, mysterious being, in whom face and form
   the indignant flush of innocence reveals a tremendous feeling, they can
   no wise comprehend, much less are able to resist.

   Accustomed to no such demonstrations of vigor and decision in the
   innocent human characters, and having it as our way to set them down
   contemptuously, without further consideration, as

   "Incapable and shallow innocents,"--

   we turn the indignant fire of Jesus into a fire of malignity; whereas,
   it should rather be conceived that Jesus here reveals his divinity, by
   what so powerfully distinguishes God himself, when he clothes his
   goodness in the tempests and thunders of nature. Decisive, great, and
   strong, Christ is yet all this, even the more sublimely, that he is
   invested, withal, in the lovely, but humanly feeble garb of innocence.
   And that this is the true conception, is clear, in the fact that no one
   ever thinks of him as weak, and no one fails to be somehow impressed
   with a sense of innocence by his life. When his enemies are called to
   show what evil or harm he hath done, they can specify nothing, save
   that he has offended their bigotry. Even Pilate, when he gives him up,
   confesses that he finds nothing in him to blame, and, shuddering with
   apprehensions he cannot subdue, washes his hands to be clear of the
   innocent blood! Thus he dies, a being holy, harmless, undefiled. And
   when he hangs, a bruised flower, drooping on his cross, and the sun
   above is dark, and the earth beneath shudders with pain, what have we
   in this funeral grief of the worlds, but a fit honor paid to the sad
   majesty of his divine innocence?
     __________________________________________________________________

   The only religious character that disowns repentance. We pass now to
   his religious character, which, we shall discover, has the remarkable
   distinction that it proceeds from a point exactly opposite to that
   which is the root or radical element in the religious character of men.
   Human piety begins with repentance. It is the effort of a being,
   implicated in wrong and writhing under the stings of guilt, to come
   unto God. The most righteous, or even self-righteous men, blend
   expressions of sorrow and vows of new obedience with their exercises.
   But Christ, in the character given him, never acknowledges sin. It is
   the grand peculiarity of his piety that he never regrets anything that
   he has done or been; expresses, nowhere, a single feeling of
   compunction, or the least sense of unworthiness. On the contrary, he
   boldly challenges his accusers, in the question--Which of you
   convinceth me of sin? and even declares, at the close of his life, in a
   solemn appeal to God, that ho has given to men, unsullied, the glory
   divine that was deposited in him.

   Now the question is not whether Christ was, in fact, the faultless
   being, assumed in his religious character. All we have to notice here
   is, that he makes the assumption, makes it not only in words, but in
   the very tenor of his exercises themselves, and that by this fact his
   piety is radically distinguished from all human piety. And no mere
   human creature, it is certain, could hold such a religious attitude,
   without shortly displaying faults that would cover him with derision,
   or excesses and delinquencies that would even disgust his friends.
   Piety without one dash of repentance, one ingenuous confession of
   wrong, one tear, one look of contrition, one request to heaven for
   pardon--let any one of mankind try this kind of piety, and me how long
   it will be ere his righteousness will prove itself to be the most
   impudent conceit! how long before his passions sobered by no
   contrition, his pride kept down by no repentance, will tempt him into
   absurdities that will turn his pretenses to mockery! No sooner does any
   one of us begin to be self-righteous, then he begins to fell into
   outward sins that shame his conceit. But, in the case of Jesus, no such
   disaster follows. Beginning with an impenitent or unrepentant piety, he
   holds it to the end, and brings no visible stain upon it.

   Now, one of two things must be true. He was either sinless, or be was
   not. If sinless, what greater, more palpable exception to the law of
   human development, than that a perfect and stainless being has for once
   lived in the flesh! If not, which is the supposition required of those
   who deny every thing above the range of human development, then we have
   a man taking up a religion without repentance, a religion not human,
   but celestial, a style of piety never taught him in his childhood, and
   never conceived or attempted among men: more than this, a style of
   piety, withal, wholly unsuited to his real character as a sinner,
   holding it as a figment of insufferable presumption to the end of life,
   and that in a way of such unfaltering grace and beauty, as to command
   the universal homage of the human race! Could there be a wider
   deviation from all we know of mere human development?

   He unites characters difficult to be united. He was also able perfectly
   to unite elements of character, that others find the greatest
   difficulty in uniting, however unevenly and partially. He is never said
   to have laughed, and yet he never produces the impression of austerity,
   moroseness, sadness, or even of being unhappy. On the contrary, he is
   described as one that appears to be commonly filled with a sacred joy;
   "rejoicing in spirit," and leaving to his disciples, in the hour of his
   departure, the bequest of his joy--"that they might have my joy
   fulfilled in themselves. "We could not long endure a human being whose
   face was never moved by laughter, or relaxed by humorous play. What
   sympathy could we have with one who appears, in this manner, to have no
   human heart? We could not even trust him. And yet we have sympathy with
   Christ; for there is somewhere in him an ocean of deep joy, and we see
   that he is, in fact, only burdened with his sympathy for see to such a
   degree, that his mighty life is overcast and oppressed by the charge he
   has undertaken. His lot is the lot of privation; he has no powerful
   friends; he has not even where to lay his head. No human being could
   appear in such a guise, without occupying us much with the sense of his
   affliction. We should be descending to him, as it were, in pity. But we
   never pity Christ, never think of him as struggling with the
   disadvantages of a lower level, to surmount them. In fact, he does not
   allow us, after all, to think much of his privations. We think of him
   more as a being of mighty resources, proving himself only the more
   sublimely, that he is in the guise of destitution. He is the most
   unworldly of beings, having no desire at all for what the earth can
   give, too great to be caught with any longing for its benefits,
   impassible even to its charms, and yet there is no ascetic sourness or
   repugnance, no misanthropic distaste in his manner; as if he were
   bracing himself against the world to keep it off. The more closely he
   is drawn to other worlds, the more fresh and susceptible is he to the
   humanities of this. The little child is an image of gladness, which his
   heart leaps forth to embrace. The wedding and the feast and the funeral
   have all their cord of sympathy in his bosom. At the wedding he is
   clothed in congratulation, at the feast in doctrine, at the funeral in
   tears; but no miser was ever drawn to his money, with a stronger
   desire, than he to worlds above the world.

   Men undertake to be spiritual, and they become ascetic; or, endeavoring
   to hold a liberal view of the comforts and pleasures of society, they
   are soon buried in the world, and slaves to its fashions; or, holding a
   scrupulous watch to keep out every particular sin, they become legal,
   and fall out of liberty; or, charmed with the noble and heavenly
   liberty, they run to negligence and irresponsible; so the earnest
   become violent, the fervent fanatical and censorious, the gentle waver,
   the firm turn bigots, the liberal grow lax, the benevolent
   ostentatious. Poor human infirmity can hold nothing steady. Where the
   pivot of righteousness is broken, the scales must needs slide off their
   balance. Indeed, it is one of the most difficult things which a
   cultivated Christian can attempt, only to sketch a theoretic view of
   character, in its true justness and proportion, so that a little more
   study, or a little more self-experience, will not require him to modify
   it. And yet the character of Christ is never modified, even by a shade
   of rectification. It is one and the same throughout. He makes no
   improvements, prunes no extravagances, returns from no eccentricities
   The balance of his character is never disturbed, or readjusted, and the
   astounding assumption on which it is based is never shaken, even by a
   suspicion that be falters in it.

   The astonishing pretensions of Jesus. There is yet another point
   related to this, in which the attitude of Jesus is even more distinct
   from any that was ever taken by man, and is yet triumphantly sustained.
   I speak of the astonishing pretensions asserted concerning his person.
   Similar pretensions have sometimes been assumed by maniacs, or insane
   persona, but never, so far as I know, by persons in the proper exercise
   of their reason. Certain it is that no mere man could take the same
   attitude of supremacy towards the race, and inherent affinity or
   oneness with God, without fatally shocking the confidence of the world
   by his effrontery. Imagine a human creature saying to the world--"I
   came forth from the Father"--"ye are from beneath, I am from above";
   facing all the intelligence and even the philosophy of the world, and
   saying, in bold assurance--"behold, a greater than Solomon is here"--"I
   am the light of the world"--"the way, the truth, and the life";
   publishing to all peoples and religions--"No man cometh to the Father,
   but by me"; promising openly in his death--"I will draw all men unto
   me"; addressing the Infinite Majesty, and testifying--"I have glorified
   thee on the earth"; calling to the human race--"Come unto me"; "follow
   me"; laying his hand upon all the dearest and moat intimate affections
   of life, and demanding a precedent love--"he that loveth father or
   mother more than me, is not worthy of me." Was there ever displayed an
   example of effrontery and spiritual conceit so preposterous? Was there
   ever a man that dared put himself on the world in such pretensions?--as
   if all light was in him; as if to follow him and be worthy of him was
   to be the conclusive or chief excellence of mankind! What but mockery
   and disgust does he challenge as the certain reward of his audacity!
   But no one is offended with Jesus on this account, and what is a sure
   test of his success, it is remarkable that, of all the readers of the
   gospel, it probably never even occurs to one in a hundred thousand, to
   blame his conceit, or the egregious vanity of his pretension,

   His pretensions enter also into his actions. Nor is there any thing
   disputable in these pretensions, least of all, any trace of myth or
   fabulous tradition. They enter into the very web of his ministry, so
   that if they are extracted and nothing left transcending mere humanity,
   nothing at all is left. Indeed, there is a tacit assumption,
   continually maintained, that far exceeds the range of these formal
   pretensions. He says--"I and the Father that sent me." What figure
   would a man present in such language--I and the Father? He goes even
   beyond this, and apparently without any thought of excess or
   presumption; classing himself with the Infinite Majesty in a common
   plural, he says--We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
   Imagine any, the greatest and holiest of mankind, any prophet, or
   apostle, saying we, of himself and the Great Jehovah! What a conception
   did he give us concerning himself, when he assumed the necessity of
   such information us this--"my Father is greater than I"; and above all,
   when he calls himself, as he often does, in a tone of
   condescension--"the Son of Man." See him also on the top of Olivet,
   looking down on the guilty city and weeping words of compassion like
   these--imagine some man weeping over London or New York, in the
   like--"How often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen
   doth gather her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" See him
   also in the supper, instituting a rite of remembrance for himself, a
   scorned, outcast man, and saying--"this is my body"--"this do in
   remembrance of me."

   Nobody offended by these pretensions. I have dwelt thus on the
   transcendent pretensions of Jesus, because them is an argument here for
   his superhumanity, which can not be resisted. For eighteen hundred
   years, these prodigious assumptions have been published and preached to
   a world that is quick to lay hold of conceit, and bring down the lofty
   airs of pretenders, and yet, during all this time, whole nations of
   people, composing as well the learned and powerful as the ignorant and
   humble, have paid their homage to the name of Jesus, detecting never
   any disagreement between his merits and his pretensions, offended never
   by any thought of his extravagance. In which we have absolute proof
   that he practically maintains his amazing assumptions! Indeed it will
   even be found that, in the common apprehension of the race, he
   maintains the merit of a most peculiar modesty, producing no conviction
   more distinctly, than that of his intense lowliness and humility. His
   worth is seen to be so great, his authority so high, his Spirit so
   celestial, that instead of being offended by his pretensions, we take
   the impression of one in whom it is even a condescension to breathe our
   air. I say not that his friends and followers take this impression, it
   is received as naturally and irresistibly by unbelievers. I do not
   recollect any skeptic or infidel who has even thought to accuse him as
   a conceited person, or to assault him in this, the weakest and
   absurdest, if not the strongest and holiest, point of his character.

   What mere man could support such pretensions? Come now, all ye that
   tell us in your wisdom of the mere natural humanity of Jesus, and help
   us to find how it is, that he is only a natural development of the
   human; select your best and wisest character; take the range, if you
   will, of all the great philosophers and estate, and choose out one that
   is most competent; or if, perchance, some one of you may imagine that
   he is himself about upon a level with Jeans (as we hear that some of
   you do), let him come forward in this trial and say--"follow me"--"be
   worthy of me"--"I am the light of the world"--"ye are from beneath, I
   am from above"--"behold a greater than Solomon is here"; take on all
   these transcendent assumptions, and see how soon your glory will be
   sifted out of you by the detective gaze, and darkened by the contempt
   of mankind! Why not? is not the challenge fair? Do you not tell us that
   you can say as divine things as he? Is it not in you, too, of course,
   to do what is human? ere you not in the front rank of human
   developments? do you not rejoice in the power to rectify many mistakes
   and errors in the words of Jesus? Give us then this one experiment, and
   see if it does not prove to you a truth that is of some consequence;
   viz., that you are a man, and that Jesus Christ is--more.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Peculiar in the passive virtues. But there is also a passive side to
   the character of Jesus which is equally peculiar, and which likewise
   demands our attention. I recollect no really great character in
   history, excepting such as may have been formed under Christianity,
   that can properly be said to have united the passive virtues, or to
   have considered them any essential part of a finished character.
   Socrates comes the nearest to such au impression, and therefore most
   resembles Christ in the submissiveness of his death. It does not
   appear, however, that his mind had taken this turn previously to his
   trial, and the submission be makes to the public sentence is, in fact,
   a refusal only to escape from the prison surreptitiously which he does,
   partly because he thinks it the duty of every good citizen not to break
   the laws, and partly, if we judge from his manner, because he is
   detained by a subtle pride; as if it were something unworthy of a grave
   philosopher, to be stealing away, as a fugitive, from the laws and
   tribunals of his country. The Stoics, indeed, have it for one of their
   great principles, that the true wisdom of life consists in a passive
   power, viz., in being able to bear suffering rightly. But they mean by
   this, the bearing of suffering so as not to feel it; a steeling of the
   mind against sensibility, and a raising of the will into such power as
   to drive back the pangs of life, or shake then off. But this, in fact,
   contains no allowance of passive virtue at all; on the contrary, it is
   an attempt so to exalt the active powers, as even to exclude every sort
   of passion, or passivity. And Stoicism corresponds, in this respect,
   with the general sentiment of the world's great characters. They are
   such as like to see things in the heroic vein, to see spirit and
   courage breasting themselves against wrong, and, where the evil can not
   be escaped by resistance, dying in a manner of defiance. Indeed it has
   been the impression of the world generally, that patience, gentleness,
   readiness to suffer wrong without resistance, is but another name for
   weakness.

   But Christ, in opposition to all such impressions, manages to connect
   these non-resisting and gentle passivities with a character of the
   severest grandeur and majesty; and, what is more, convinces us that no
   truly great character can exist without them.

   Does not falter in the common trials of existence. Observe him, first,
   in what may be called the common trials of existence. For if you will
   put a character to the severest of all tests, see whether it can bear
   without faltering, the little common ills and hindrances of life. Many
   a man will go to his martyrdom, with a spirit of firmness and heroic
   composure, whom a little weariness or nervous exhaustion, some silly
   prejudice, or capricious opposition, would, for the moment, throw into
   a fit of vexation, or ill-nature. Great occasions rally great
   principles, and brace the mind to a lofty bearing, a bearing that is
   even above itself. But trials that make no occasion at all, leave it to
   show the goodness and beauty it has in its own disposition. And here
   precisely is the superhuman glory of Christ as a character, that he is
   just as perfect, exhibits just as great a spirit, in little trials as
   in great ones. In all the history of his life, we are not able to
   detect the faintest indication that he slips or falters. And this is
   the more remarkable, that he is prosecuting so great a work, with so
   great enthusiasm counting it his meat and drink, and pouring into it
   all the energies of his life. For when men have great works on hand,
   their very enthusiasm runs to impatience. When thwarted or unreasonably
   hindered, their soul strikes fire against the obstacles they meet, they
   worry themselves at every hindrance, every disappointment, and break
   out in stormy and fanatical violence. But Jesus, for some reason, is
   just as even, just as serene, in all his petty vexations, and
   hindrances, as if he bad nothing on hand to do. A kind of sacred
   patience invests him everywhere. Having no element of crude will noised
   with his work, he is able, in all trial and opposition, to hold a
   condition of serenity above the clouds, and let them sail under him,
   without ever obscuring the sun. He is poor, and hungry, and weary, and
   despised, insulted by his enemies, deserted by his friends, but never
   disheartened, never fretted or ruffled.

   You see, meantime, that he is no Stoic; he visibly feels every such ill
   as his delicate and sensitive nature must, but he has some sacred and
   sovereign good present, to mingle with his pains, which, as it were,
   naturally and without any self-watching, allays them. He does not seem
   to rule his temper, but rather to have none; for temper, in the sense
   of passion, is a fury that follows the will, as the lightnings follow
   the disturbing forces of the winds among the clouds; and accordingly,
   where there is no self-will to roll up the clouds and hurl them through
   the sky, the lightnings hold their equilibrium, and are as though they
   were not.

   His passion no mere human martyrdom. As regards what is called
   pre-eminently his passion, the scene of martyrdom that closes his life,
   it is easy to distinguish a character in it which separates it from all
   mere human martyrdoms. Thus, it will be observed, that his agony, the
   scene in which his suffering is bitterest and most evident, is, on
   human principles, wholly misplaced. It comes before the time, when as
   yet there is no arrest, and no human prospect that there will be any.
   He is at large, to go where he pleases, and in perfect outward safety.
   His disciples have just been gathered round him in a scene of more than
   family tenderness and affection. Indeed it is but a very few hours
   since that he was coming into the city, at the head of a vast
   procession, followed by loud acclamations, and attended by such honors
   as may fitly celebrate the inaugural of a king. Yet here, with no bad
   sign apparent, we see him plunged into a scene of deepest distress, and
   racked, in his feeling, with a more than mortal agony. Coming out of
   this, assured and comforted, he is shortly invested, brought to trial
   and crucified; where, if there be any thing questionable in his manner,
   it is in the fact that he is even more composed than some would have
   him to be, not even stooping to defend himself or vindicate his
   innocence. And when he dies, it is not as when the martyrs die. They
   die for what they have said, and remaining silent will not recant. He
   dies for what he has not said, and still is silent.

   His agony misplaced, taken as being only a man's. By the misplacing of
   his agony thus, and the strange silence he observes when the real hour
   of agony is come, we are put entirely at fault on natural principles.
   But it was not for him to wait, as being only a man, till he is
   arrested, and the hand of death is upon him, then to be nerved by the
   occasion to a show of victory. He that was before Abraham, must also be
   before his occasions. In a time of safety, in a cool hour of
   retirement, unaccountably to his friends, he falls into a dreadful
   context and struggle of mind; coming out of it finally to go through
   his most horrible tragedy of crucifixion, with the serenity of a
   spectator!

   It is, humanly speaking, excessive. Why now this so great intensity of
   sorrow? why this agony? Was there not something unmanly in it,
   something unworthy of a really great soul? Take him to be only a man,
   and there probably was; nay, if he were a woman, the same might be
   said. But this one thing is clear, that no one of mankind, whether man
   or woman, ever had the sensibility to suffer so intensely; even showing
   the body, for the mere struggle and pain of the mind, exuding and
   dripping with blood. Evidently there is something mysterious here;
   which mystery is vehicle to our feeling, and rightfully may be, of
   something divine. What, we begin to ask, should be the power of a
   superhuman sensibility? and how far should the human vehicle shake
   under such a power? How too should an innocent and pure spirit be
   exercised, when about to suffer, in his own person, the greatest wrong
   ever committed?

   The pathology is divine. Besides there is a vicarious spirit in love;
   all love inserts itself vicariously into the sufferings and woes and,
   in a certain sense, the sins of others, taking them on itself as a
   burden. How then, if perchance Jesus should be divine, an embodiment of
   God's love in the world--how should he feel, and by what signs of
   feeling manifest his sensibility, when a fallen race are just about to
   do the damning sin that crowns their guilty history; to crucify the
   only perfect being that ever came into the world; to crucify even him,
   the messenger and representative to them of the love of God, the
   deliverer who has taken their case and cause upon him! Whomever duly
   ponders these questions, will find that he is led away, more and more,
   from any supposition of the mere mortality of Jesus. What he looks
   upon, he will more and more distinctly see to be the pathology of a
   superhuman anguish. It stands, he will perceive, in no mortal key. It
   will be to him the anguish, visibly, not of any pusillanimous feeling,
   but of holy character itself; nay, of a mysteriously transcendent, or
   somehow divine character.

   His defence before Pilate all that could be made. But why did be not
   defend his cause and justify his innocence in the trial? Partly because
   he had the wisdom to see that there really was and could be no trial,
   and that one who undertakes to plead with a mob, only mocks his own
   virtue, throwing words into the air that is already filled with the
   clamors of prejudice. To plead innocence in such a case, is only to
   make a protestation, such as indicates fear, and is really unworthy of
   a great and composed spirit. A man would have done it, but Jesus did
   not. Besides, there was a plea of innocence in the manner of Jesus, and
   the few very significant words that he dropped, that had an effect on
   the mind of Pilate, more searching and powerful than any formal
   protestations. And the more we study the conduct of Jesus during the
   whole scene, the more shall we be satisfied that he said enough; the
   more admire the mysterious composure, the wisdom, the self-possession,
   and the superhuman patience of the sufferer. It was visibly the
   death-scene of a transcendent love. He dies not as a man, but rather as
   some one might, who is mysteriously more and higher. So thought aloud
   the hard-faced soldier--"Truly this was the Son of God." As if he had
   said--"I have seen men die--this is not a man. They call him Son of
   God--he can not be less." Can he be less to us?
     __________________________________________________________________

   He undertakes what is humanly impossible. But Christ shows himself to
   be a superhuman character, not in the personal traits only, exhibited
   in his life, but even more sublimely in the undertakings, works, and
   teachings, by which he proved his Messiahship.

   Consider then the reach of his undertaking; which, if he was only a
   man, shows him to have been the most extravagant and even wildest of
   all human enthusiasts. Contrary to every religious prejudice of his
   nation and even of his time, contrary to the comparatively narrow and
   exclusive religion of Moses itself, and to all his training under it,
   he undertakes to organise a kingdom of God, or kingdom of heaven on
   earth. His purpose includes a new moral creation of the race--not of
   the Jews only and of men proselyted to their covenant, but of the whole
   human race. He declared thus, at an early date in his ministry, that
   many shall come from the east and the west and sit down with Abraham,
   and Jews and Jacob, in the kingdom of God; that the field is the world;
   and that God so loves the world, as to give for it his only-begotten
   Son. He also declared that his gospel shall be published to all
   nations, and gave his apostles their commission to go into all the
   world, and publish his gospel to every creature.

   He assumes to set up the kingdom of God among men. Here, then, we have
   the grand idea of his mission--it is to new-create the human race and
   restore it to God, in the unity of a spiritual kingdom. And upon this
   single fact, Reinhard erects a complete argument for his extra human
   character; going into a formal review of all the great founders of
   states and most celebrated lawgivers, the great heroes and defenders of
   nations, all the wise kings and statesmen, all the philosophers, all
   the prophet founders of religions, and discovering as a fact that no
   such thought as this, or nearly proximate to this, had ever before been
   taken up by any living character in history; showing also how it had
   happened to every other great character, however liberalized by
   culture, to be limited in some way to the interest of his own people,
   or empire, and set in opposition, or antagonism, more or less
   decidedly, to the rest of the world. But to Jesus alone, the simple
   Galilean carpenter, it happens otherwise; that, never having seen a map
   of the world in his whole life, or heard the name of half the great
   nations on it, he undertakes, coming out of his shop, a scheme as much
   vaster and more difficult than that of Alexander, as it proposes more
   and what is more divinely benevolent! This thought of a universal
   kingdom, cemented in God--why, the immense Roman empire of his day,
   constructed by so many ages of war and conquest, is a bauble in
   comparison, both as regards the extent and the cost! And yet the rustic
   tradesman of Galilee propounds even this for his errand, and that in a
   way of assurance, as simple and quiet, as if the immense reach of his
   plan were, in fact, a matter to him of no consideration.

   His plan covers ages of time. Nor is this all; there is included in his
   plan, what, to any mere man, would be yet more remote from the possible
   confidence of his frailty; it is a plan as universal in time, as it is
   in the scope of its objects. It does not expect to be realized in a
   lifetime, or even in many centuries to come. He calls it
   understandingly, his grain of mustard-seed; which, however, is to grow,
   he declares, and overshadow the whole earth. But the courage of Jesus,
   counting a thousand years to be only a single day, is equal to the run
   of his work. He sees a rock of stability, where men see only frailty
   and weakness. Peter himself, the impulsive and always unreliable Peter,
   turns into rock and becomes a great foundation, as he looks upon him.
   "On this rock," he says, "I will build my church, and the gates of hell
   shall not prevail against it." His expectation, too, reaches boldly out
   beyond his own death; that, in fact, is to be the seed of his great
   empire--"except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
   abideth," he says, "alone." And if we will see with what confidence and
   courage he adheres to his plan, when the time of his death
   approaches--how far he is from giving it up as lost, or as an exploded
   vision of his youthful enthusiasm--we have only to observe his last
   interview with the two sisters of Bethany, in whom hospitality he was
   so often comforted. When the box of precious ointment is broken upon
   his head, which Judas reproves as a useless expense, he discovers a sad
   propriety or even prophecy, in what the woman has done, as connected
   with his death, now at hand. But it does not touch his courage, we
   perceive, or the confidence of his plan, or even cast a shade on his
   prospect, "Let her alone. She hath done what she could. She is come
   aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. Verily I say unto you,
   wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
   this also that this woman hath done shall be told for a memorial of
   her." Such was the sublime confidence he had in a plan that was to run
   through all future ages, and would scarcely begin to show its fruit
   during his own lifetime.

   Such attempts not human. Is this great idea then, which no man ever
   before conceived, the raising of the whole human race to God, a plan
   sustained with such evenness of courage, and a confidence of the
   world's future so far transcending any human example--is this a human
   development? Regard the benevolence of it, the universality of it, the
   religious grandeur of it, as a work readjusting the relations of God
   and his government with men--the cost, the length of time it will
   cover, and the far-off date of its completion--is it in this scale that
   a Nazarene carpenter, a poor uneducated villager, lays out his plans
   and graduates the confidence of his undertakings? There have been great
   enthusiasts in the world, and they have shown their infirmity by
   lunatic airs, appropriate to their extravagance. But it is not human,
   we may safely affirm, to lay out projects transcending all human
   ability, like this of Jesus, and which cannot be completed in many
   thousands of years, doing it in all the airs of sobriety, entering on
   the performance without parade, and yielding life to it firmly as the
   inaugural of its triumph. No human creature sits quietly down to a
   perpetual project, one that proposes to be executed only at the end, or
   final harvest of the world. That is not human, but divine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Passing now to what is more interior in his ministry, taken as a
   revelation of his character, we are struck with another distinction,
   viz., that he takes rank with the poor, and grounds all the immense
   expectations of his cause, on a beginning made with the lowly and
   dejected classes of the world. He was born to the lot of the poor. His
   manners, tastes, and intellectual attainments, however, visibly outgrew
   his condition, and that in such a degree that, if he had been a mere
   human character, he must have suffered some painful distaste for the
   kind of society in which he lived. The great, as we perceive, flocked
   to hear him, and sometimes came even by night to receive his
   instructions. He saw the highest circles of society and influence open
   to him, if he only desired to enter them. And, if he was a properly
   human character, what virtuous, but rising young man would have had a
   thought of impropriety, in accepting the elevation within his reach;
   considering it as the proper reward of his industry and the merit of
   his character--not to speak of the contempt for his humble origin, and
   his humble associates, which every upstart person, of only ordinary
   virtue, is so commonly seen to manifest. Still he adheres to the poor,
   and makes them the object of his ministry. And what is more peculiar,
   he visibly has a kind of interest in their society, which is wanting in
   that of the higher classes; perceiving, apparently, that they have a
   certain aptitude for receiving right impressions, which the others have
   not. They are not the wise and prudent, filled with the conceit of
   learning and station, but they are the ingenuous babes of poverty, open
   to conviction, prepared, by their humble lot, to receive thoughts and
   doctrines in advance of their age. Therefore he loves the poor, and,
   without descending to their low manners, he delights to be identified
   with them. He is more assiduous in their service than other men have
   been in serving the great. He goes about on foot, teaching them, and
   healing their sick; occupying his great and elevated mind, for whole
   years, with details of labor and care, which the nurse of no hospital
   had ever laid upon him--insanities, blind eyes, fevers, fluxes,
   leprosies, and sores. His patients are all below his level and unable
   to repay him, even by a breath of congenial sympathy; and nothing
   supports him but the consciousness of good which attends his labors.

   No great social architect ever saw the wisdom of it. Meantime, consider
   what contempt for the poor had hitherto prevailed among all the great
   statesmen and philosophers of the world. The poor were not society, or
   any part of society. They were only the conveniences and drudges of
   society; appendages of luxury and state, tools of ambition, material to
   be used in the wars. No man who had taken up the idea of some great
   change or reform in society, no philosopher who had conceived the
   notion of building up an ideal state or republic, ever thought of
   beginning with the poor. Influence was seen to reside in the higher
   classes, and the only hope of reaching the world, by any scheme of
   social regeneration, was to begin with them, and through them operate
   its results. But Christ, if we call him a philosopher, and, if he is
   only a man, we can call him by no higher name, was the poor man's
   philosopher; the first and only one that had ever appeared. Seeing the
   higher circles open to him, and tempted to imagine that, if he could
   once get footing for his doctrine among the influential and the great,
   he should thus secure his triumph more easily, he had yet no such
   thought. He laid his foundations, as it were, below all influence, and,
   as men would judge, threw himself away.

   And precisely here did he display a wisdom and character totally in
   advance of his age. Eighteen centuries have passed away, and we now
   seem just beginning to understand the transcendent depth of this
   feature in his mission and his character. We appear to be just waking
   up to it as a discovery, that the blessing and upraising of the messes
   are the fundamental interest of society--a discovery, however, which is
   only a proof that the life of Jesus has at length begun to penetrate
   society and public history. It is precisely this which is working so
   many and great changes in our times, giving liberty and right to the
   enslaved many, seeking their education, encouraging their efforts by
   new and better hopes, producing an aversion to war, which has been the
   fatal source of their misery and depression, and opening, as we hope, a
   new era of comfort, light, and virtue in the world. It is as if some
   higher and better thought had visited our race--which higher thought is
   in the life of Jesus. The schools of all the philosophers are gone,
   hundreds of years ago, and all their visions have died away into thin
   air; but the poor man's philosopher still lives, bringing up his poor
   to liberty, light, and character, and drawing the nations on to a
   brighter and better day,
     __________________________________________________________________

   And still he raises no partisan feeling. At the some time, the more
   than human character of Jesus is displayed also in the fact that,
   identifying himself thus with the poor, he is yet able to do it,
   without eliciting any feelings of partisanship in them. To one who will
   be at the pains to reflect a little, nothing will seem more difficult
   than this; to become the patron of a class, a downtrodden and despised
   class, without rallying in them a feeling of intense malignity. And
   that for the reason, partly, that no patron, however just or
   magnanimous, is ever quite able to suppress the feelings of a partisan
   in himself. A little ambition, pricked on by a little abuse, a faint
   desire of popularity playing over the face of his benevolence, and
   tempting him to loosen a little of ill-nature, as tinder to the
   passions of his sect--something of this kind is sure to kindle some
   fire of malignity in his clients.

   No human leader in this. Besides, men love to be partisans. Even Paul
   and Apollos and Peter had their sects or schools, glorying in one
   against another. With all their efforts, they could not suppress a
   weakness so contemptible. But no such feeling could ever get footing
   under Christ. If his disciples had forbidden one to heal in the name of
   Jesus, because he followed not with there, he gently rebuked them, and
   made them feel that he had larger views than to suffer any such folly.
   As the friend of the poor and oppressed class, he set himself openly
   against their enemies, and chastised them as oppressors, with the most
   terrible rebukes. He exposed the absurdity of their doctrine, and
   silenced them in argument; he launched his thunderbolts against their
   base hypocrisies; but it does not appear that the populace ever
   testified their pleasure, even by a cheer, or gave vent to any angry
   emotion under cover of his leadership. For there was something still,
   in the manner and air of Jesus, which made them feel it to be
   inappropriate, and even made it impossible. It was as if some being
   were here, taking their part, whom it were even en irreverence to
   applaud, much more to second by any partisan clamor. They would as soon
   have thought of cheering the angel in the nun, or of rallying under him
   as the head of their faction.

   On one occasion, when he had fed the multitudes by a miracle, he saw
   that their national superstitions were excited, and that, regarding him
   en the Messiah predicted in the Scriptures, they were about to take him
   by force and make him their king; but this was a national feeling, not
   the feeling of a class. Its root was superstition, not hatred. His
   triumphal entry into Jerusalem, attended by the acclamations of the
   multitude, if this be not one of the fables or myths, which our modern
   criticism rejects, is yet no demonstration of popular faction, or party
   animosity. Robbing it of its mystical and miraculous character, as the
   inaugural of the Messiah, it has no real signification. In a few hours,
   after all, these hosannas are hushed, Jesus is alone and forsaken, and
   the very multitudes he might seem to have enlisted, are crying "Crucify
   him!" On the whole, it cannot be said that Jesus was ever popular. He
   was followed at times, by great multitudes of people, whose love of the
   marvellous worked on their superstitions, to draw them after him. They
   came also to be cured of their diseases. They knew him as their friend.
   But there was yet something in him that forbade their low and malignant
   feelings gathering into a conflagration round him. He presents, indeed,
   an instance that stands alone in history, as God at the summit of the
   worlds, where a person has identified himself with a class, without
   creating a faction, and without becoming a popular character.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Consider him next as a teacher; his method and manner, and the other
   characteristics of his excellence, apart from his doctrine. That will
   be distinctly considered in another place.

   Original and independent as no man is. First of all, we notice the
   perfect originality and independence of his teaching. We have a great
   many men who are original, in the sense of being originators within a
   certain boundary of educated thought. But the originality of Christ is
   uneducated. That he draws nothing from the stores of learning, can be
   seen at a glance. The impression we have in reading his instructions,
   justifies to the letter, the language of his contemporaries, when they
   say, "this man hath never learned." There is nothing in any of his
   allusions, or forms of speech that indicates learning. Indeed, there is
   nothing in him that belongs to his age or country--no one opinion, or
   task, or prejudice. The attempts that have been made, in a way of
   establishing his mere natural manhood, to show that he borrowed his
   sentiments from the Persians and the eastern forms of religion, or that
   he had been intimate with the Essenes, and borrowed from them, or that
   he must have been acquainted with the schools and religions of Egypt,
   deriving his doctrine from them--all attempts of the kind have so
   palpably failed, as not even to require a deliberate answer.

   If he is simply a man, as we hear, then he is most certainly a new and
   singular kind of man, never before heard of; one who visibly is quite
   as great a miracle in the world as if he were not a man. We can see for
   ourselves, in the simple directness and freedom of his teachings, that
   whatever he advances is from himself. Shakspeare, for instance, whom we
   name as being probably the most creative and original spirit the world
   has ever produced, one of the class, too, that are called self-made
   men, is yet tinged, in all his works, with human learning. His glory
   is, indeed, that so much of what is great in history and historic
   character, lives and appears in his dramatic creation. He is the high
   priest, we sometimes hear, of human nature. But Christ, understanding
   human nature so as to address it more skilfully than he, derives no
   help from historic examples. He is the high-priest, rather, of the
   divine nature, speaking as one that has come out from God, and has
   nothing to borrow from the world. It is not to be detected, by any
   sign, that the human sphere in which he moved imparted any thing to
   him. His teachings are just as full of divine nature, as Shakspeare's
   of human.

   Teaches by no human method. Neither does he teach by the human methods.
   He does not speculate about God, as a school professor, drawing out
   conclusions by a practice on words, and deeming that the way of proof;
   he does not build up a frame of evidence from below, by some
   constructive process, such as the philosophers delight in; but he
   simply speaks of God and spiritual things as one who has come out from
   Him, to tell us what he knows. And his simple telling brings us the
   reality; proves it to us in its own sublime self-evidence; awakens even
   the consciousness of it in our own bosom; so that formal arguments or
   dialectic proofs offend as by their coldness, and seem, in fact, to be
   only opaque substances set between us and the light. Indeed, be makes
   even the world luminous by his words--fills it with an immediate and
   new sense of God, which nothing has ever been able to expel. The
   incense of the upper world is brought out, in his garments, and flows
   abroad, as perfume, on the poisoned air.

   Warped by no desire to gain assent. At the same time, he never reveals
   the infirmity so commonly shown by human teachers, when they veer a
   little from their point, or turn their doctrine off by shades of
   variation, to catch the assent of multitudes. He never conforms to an
   expectation, even of his friend. When they look to find a great prophet
   in him, he offers nothing, in the modes of the prophet. When they ask
   for places of distinction in his kingdom, he rebukes their folly, and
   tells them he has nothing to give, but a share in his reproaches and
   his poverty. When they look to see him take the sword as the Great
   Messiah of their nation, calling the people to his standard, he tells
   them he is no warrior and no king, but only a messenger of love to lost
   men; one that has come to minister and die, but not to set up or
   restore the kingdom. Every expectation that rises up to greet him, is
   repulsed; and yet, so great is the power of his manner, that multitudes
   are held fast, and can not yield their confidence. Enveloped as he is
   in the darkest mystery, they trust him still; going after him, hanging
   on his words, as if detained by some charmed influence, which they
   cannot shake off or resist. Never was there a teacher that so uniformly
   baffled every expectation of his followers, never one that was followed
   so persistently.

   Comprehensive, under no human conditions. Again, the singular balance
   of character displayed in the teachings of Jesus, indicates an
   exemption from the standing infirmity of human nature. Human opinions
   are formed under a law that seems to be universal. First, two opposite
   extremes are thrown up, in two opposite leaders or parties; then a
   third party enters, trying to find what truth they both are endeavoring
   to vindicate, and settle thus a view of the subject, that includes the
   truth and clears the one-sided extremes, which opposing words or
   figures, not yet measured in their force, had produced. It results, in
   this manner, that no man, even the broadest in his apprehensions, is
   ever at the point of equilibrium as regards all subjects. Even the
   ripest of us are continually falling into some extreme, and losing our
   balance, afterward to be corrected by some other who discovers our
   error, or that of our school.

   Could not hold a one-sided view. But Christ was of no school or party,
   and never went to any extreme--words could never turn him to a
   one-sided view of anything. This is the remarkable fact that
   distinguishes him from any other known teacher of the world. Having
   nothing to work out in a word-process, but every thing clear in the
   simple intuition of his superhuman intelligence, he never pushes
   himself to any human eccentricity. It does not even appear that he is
   trying, as we do, to balance opposites and clear extravagances, but he
   does it, as one who can not imagine a one-sided view of any thing. He
   is never a radical, never a conservative. He will not allow his
   disciples to deny him before kings and governments, be will not let
   them renounce their allegiance to Cæsar. He exposes the oppressions of
   the Pharisees in Moses' seat, but, encouraging no factious resistance,
   says--"do as they command you." His position as a reformer was
   universal; according to his principles almost nothing, whether in
   church or state, or in social life, was right, and yet he is thrown
   into no antagonism against the world. How a man will do, when he
   engages only in some one reform, acting from his own human force; the
   fuming, storming phrenzy, the holy rage and tragic smoke of his
   violence, how he kindles against opposition, grows bitter and restive
   because of delay, and finally comes to maturity in a character
   thoroughly detestable--all this we know. But Christ, with all the world
   upon his hands, and a reform to be carried in almost every thing, is
   yet as quiet and cordial, and as little in the attitude of bitterness
   or impatience, as if all hearts were with him, or the work already
   done; so perfect is the balance of his feeling, so intuitively
   moderated is it by a wisdom not human.

   Clear of all the current superstitions. We can not stay to sketch a
   full outline of this particular and sublime excellence, as it was
   displayed in his life. It will be seen as clearly in a single
   comparison or contrast as in many, or in a more extended inquiry. Take,
   then, for an example, what may be observed in his open repugnance to
   all superstition, combined with his equal repugnance to what is
   commonly praised as a mode of liberality. He lived in a superstitious
   age and among a superstitious people. He was a person of low education,
   and nothing, as we know, clings to the uneducated mind with the
   tenacity of a superstition. Lord Bacon, for example, a man certainly of
   the very highest intellectual training, was yet harmed by superstitions
   too childish to be named with respect, and which clung to him despite
   of all his philosophy, even to his death. But Christ, with no learned
   culture at all, comes forth out of Galilee, as perfectly clean of all
   the superstitions of his time, as if he had been a disciple, from his
   childhood, of Hume or Strauss. "You children of superstition think," he
   says, "that those Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their
   sacrifices, and those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, must
   have been monsters, to suffer such things. I tell you, nay; but except
   ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." To another company he
   says--"You imagine, in your Pharisaic and legal morality, that the
   Sabbath of Moses stands in the letter; but I tell you that the Sabbath
   is made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; little honor, therefore,
   do you pay to God, when you teach that it is not lawful to do good on
   this day. Your washings are a great point, you tithe herbs and seeds
   with a sanctimonious fidelity, would it not be as well for you,
   teachers of the law, to have some respect to the weightier matters of
   justice, faith, and benevolence?" Thus, while Socrates, one of the
   greatest and purest of human souls, a man who has. attained to many
   worthy conceptions of God, hidden from his idolatrous countrymen, is
   constrained to sacrifice a cock to Esculapius, the uneducated Jesus
   lives and dies superior to every superstition of his time; believing
   nothing because it is believed, respecting nothing because it is
   sanctified by custom and by human observance. Even in the closing scene
   of his life, we see his learned and priestly associates refusing to go
   into the judgment-hall of Caiaphas, lest they should be ceremonially
   defiled and disqualified for the feast; though detained by no scruple
   at all as regards the instigation of a murder! While he, on the other
   hand, pitying their delusions, prays for them from his cross--"Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do."

   But no liberalist. And yet Christ is no liberal, never takes the ground
   or boasts the distinction of a liberal among his countrymen, because it
   is not a part of his infirmity, in discovering an error here, to fly to
   an excess there. His ground is charity, not liberality; and the two are
   as wide apart in their practical implications, as adhering to all
   truth, and being loose in all. Charity holds fast the minutest atoms of
   truth, as being precious and divine, offended by even so much as a
   thought of laxity. Liberality loosens the terms of truth; permitting
   easily and with careless magnanimity variations from it; consenting, as
   it were, in its own sovereignty, to overlook or allow them; and
   subsiding thus, ere long, into a licentious indifference to all truth,
   and a general defect of responsibility in regard to it. Charity extends
   allowance to men; liberality, to falsities themselves. Charity takes
   the truth to be sacred and immovable; liberality allows it to be marred
   and maimed at pleasure. How different the manner of Jesus in this
   respect from that unreverent, feeble laxity, that lets the errors be as
   good as the truths, and takes it for a sign of intellectual eminence,
   that one can be floated comfortably in the abysses of liberalism.
   "Judge not," he says, in holy charity, "that ye be not judged"; and
   again, in holy exactness, "whosoever shall break, or teach to break,
   one of these least commandments shall be least in the kingdom of
   God"--in the same way, "he that is not with us is against us"; and
   again, "he that is not against us is for us"--in the same way also, "ye
   tithe mint, anise, and cummin"; and again, "these things ought ye to
   have done, and not to leave the other undone"--once more, too, in the
   same way, "he that is without sin, let him cast the first stone"; and
   again, "go, and sin no more." So magnificent and sublime, so plainly
   divine, is the balance of Jesus, Nothing throws him off the centre on
   which truth rests; no prejudice, no opposition, no attempt to right a
   mistake, or rectify a delusion, or reform a practice. If this be human,
   I do not know, for one, what it is to be human.

   His simplicity is perfect. Again, it is a remarkable and even
   superhuman distinction of Jesus, that, while he is advancing doctrines
   so far transcending all deductions of philosophy, and opening mysteries
   that defy all human powers of explication, he is yet able to set his
   teachings in a form of simplicity, that accommodates all classes of
   minds. And this, for the reason that he speaks directly to men's
   convictions themselves, without and apart from any learned and curious
   elaboration, such as the uncultivated can not follow. No one of the
   great writers of antiquity had even propounded, as yet, a doctrine of
   virtue which the multitude could understand. It was taught as being to
   kalon [the fair], or to prepon, [the becoming], or something of that
   nature, as distant from all their apprehensions, and as destitute of
   motive power, as if it were a doctrine of mineralogy. Considered as a
   gift to the world at large, it was the gift of a stone, not of bread.
   But Jesus tells them directly, in a manner level to their
   understanding, what they want, what they must do and be, to inherit
   eternal life, and their inmost convictions answer to his words.
   Besides, his doctrine is not so much a doctrine as a biography, a
   personal power, a truth all motivity, a love walking the earth in the
   proximity of a mortal fellowship. He only speaks what goes forth as a
   feeling and a power in his life, breathing into all hearts. To be
   capable of his doctrine, only requires that the hearer be a human
   creature, wanting to know the truth.

   Shining as pure light. Call him, then, who will, a man, a human
   teacher; what human teacher ever came down thus upon the soul of the
   race, as a beam of light from the skies--pure light, shining directly
   into the visual orb of the mind, a light for all that live, a full
   transparent day, in which truth bathes the spirit as an element. Others
   talk and speculate about truth, and those who can may follow; but Jesus
   is the truth, and lives it, and if he is a mere human teacher, he is
   the first who was ever able to find a form for truth, at all adequate
   to the world's uses. And yet the truths he teaches outreach all the
   doctrines of all the philosophers of the world. He excels them a
   hundred-fold more, in the scope and grandeur of his doctrine, than he
   does in his simplicity itself.

   Is this human, or is it plainly divine? If you will see what is human,
   or what the wisdom of humanity would ordain, it is this--exactly what
   the subtle and accomplished Celsus, the great adversary of Christianity
   in its original promulgation, alleges for one of his principal
   arguments against it "Woollen manufacturers," he says, "shoemakers and
   curriers, the most uneducated and boorish of men are zealous advocates
   of this religion; men who can not open their mouths before the learned,
   and who only try to gain over the women and children in families." [1]
   And again, what is only the same objection, under a different form,
   assuming that religion, like a philosophy, must be for the learned, he
   says, "He must be void of understanding who can believe that Greeks and
   barbarians, in Asia, Europe, and Lybia--all nations to the ends of the
   earth--can unite in one and the same religious doctrine." [2] So also,
   Plato says, "it is not easy to find the Father and Creator of all
   existence, and when he is found it is impossible to make him known to
   all." [3] "But exactly this," says Justin Martyr, "is what our Christ
   has effected by his power." And Tertullian, also, glorying in the
   simplicity of the gospel, so already proved to be a truly divine
   excellence, says, "Every Christian artisan has found God, and points
   him out to thee, and in fact, shows thee every thing which is sought
   for in God, although Plato maintains that the Creator of the world is
   not easily found, and that, when he is found, he can not be made known
   to all," [4] Here, then, we have Christ against Celsus, and Christ
   against Plato. These agree in assuming that we have a God, whom only
   the great can mount high enough in argument to know. Christ reveals a
   God whom the humblest artisan can teach, and all mankind embrace, with
   a faith that unifies them all.

   This morality is not artistic. Again, the morality of Jesus has a
   practical superiority to that of all human teachers, in the fact that
   it is not an artistic, or theoretically elaborated scheme, but one that
   is propounded in precepts that carry their own evidence, and are, in
   fact, great spiritual laws ordained by God, in the throne of religion.
   He did not draw long arguments to settle what the summum bonum is, and
   then produce a scheme of ethics to correspond. He did not go into the
   vexed question, what is the foundation of virtue? and hang a system
   upon his answer. Nothing falls into an artistic shape, as when Plato or
   Socrates tusked what kind of action is beautiful in action? reducing
   the principles of morality to a form as difficult for the uncultivated,
   as the art of sculpture itself. Yet Christ excels them all in the
   beauty of his precepts, without once appearing to consider their
   beauty. He simply comes forth telling us, from God, what to do, without
   deducing any thing in a critical way; and yet, while nothing has ever
   yet been settled by the critics and theorizing philosophers, that could
   stand fast and compel the assent of the race, even for a year, the
   morality of Christ is about as firmly seated in the convictions of men,
   as the law of gravity in their bodies.

   But intuitive and original. He comes into the world full of all moral
   beauty, as God of physical; and as God was not obliged to set himself
   to a course of æsthetic study, when he created the forms and landscapes
   of the world, so Christ comes to his rules, by no critical practice in
   words. He opens his lips, and the creative glory of his mind pours
   itself forth in living precepts--Do to others as ye would that others
   should do to you--Blessed are the peacemakers--Smitten upon one cheek,
   turn the other--Resist not evil--Forgive your enemies--Do good to them
   that hate you--Lend not, hoping to receive--Receive the truth as little
   children. Omitting all the deep spiritual doctrines he taught, and
   taking all the human teachers on their own ground, the ground of
   preceptive morality, they are seen at once to be meager and cold;
   little artistic inventions, gleams of high conceptions caught by study,
   having about the same relation to the Christian morality that a statue
   has to the flexibility, the self-active force, and flushing warmth of
   man, as he goes forth in the image of his Creator, to be the reflection
   of His beauty and the living instrument of his will. Indeed, it is the
   very distinction of Jesus that he teaches, not a verbal, but an
   original, vital, and divine morality. He does not dress up a moral
   picture and ask you to observe its beauty, he only tells you how to
   live; and the most beautiful characters the world has ever seen, have
   been those who received and lived his precepts without once conceiving
   their beauty.

   Never anxious for success. Once more, it is a high distinction of
   Christ's character, as seen in his teachings, that he is never anxious
   for the success of his doctrine. Fully conscious of the fact that the
   world is against him, scoffed at, despised, hated, alone too, in his
   cause, and without partisans that have any public influence, no man has
   ever been able to detect in him the least anxiety for the final success
   of his doctrine. He is never jealous of contradiction. When his friends
   display their dulness and incapacity, or even when they forsake hint,
   he is never ruffled or disturbed. He rests on his words, with a
   composure as majestic as if he were sitting on the circle of the
   heavens. Now the consciousness of truth, we are not about to deny, has
   an effect of this nature in every truly great mind. But when it has had
   an effect so complete? What human teacher, what great philosopher, has
   not shown some traces of anxiety for his school, that indicated his
   weakness; some pride in his friends, some dislike of his enemies, some
   traces of wounded ambition, when disputed or denied? But here is a lone
   man, a humble, uneducated man, never schooled into the elegant fiction
   of an assumed composure, or practised in the conventional dignities of
   manners, and yet, finding all the world against him, the world does not
   rest on its axle more firmly than he upon his doctrine. Questioned by
   Pilate what he means by truth, it is enough to answer--"He that is of
   the truth heareth my voice." If this be human, no other man of the
   race, we are sure, has ever dignified humanity by a like example.

   Such is Christ as a teacher. When has the world seen a phenomenon like
   this; a lonely uninstructed youth, coming forth amid the moral darkness
   of Galilee, even more distinct from his age, and from every thing
   around him, than a Plato would be rising up alone in some wild tribe in
   Oregon, assuming thus a position at the head of the world, and
   maintaining it, for eighteen centuries, by the pure self-evidence of
   his life and doctrine! Does he this by the force of mere human talent
   or genius? If so, it is time that we begin to look to genius for
   miracles; for there in really no greater miracle.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is yet one other and more inclusive distinction of the character
   of Jesus, which must not be omitted, and which sets him off more widely
   from all the mere men of the race, just because it raises a contrast
   which is, at once, total and experimental. Human characters are always
   reduced in their eminence, and the impressions of awe they have raised,
   by a closer and more complete acquaintance. Weakness and blemish are
   discovered by familiarity; admiration lets in qualifiers; on approach,
   the halo dims a little. But it was not so with Christ. With his
   disciples, in closest terms of intercourse, for three whole years;
   their brother, friend, teacher, monitor, guest, fellow-traveler; seen
   by them under all the conditions of public ministry, and private
   society, where the ambition of show, or the pride of power, or the
   ill-nature provoked by annoyance, or the vanity drawn out by
   confidence, would most certainly be reducing him to the criticism even
   of persons most unsophisticated, he is yet visibly raising their sense
   of his degree and quality; becoming a greater wonder and holier
   mystery, and gathering to his person feelings of reverence and awe, at
   once more general and more sacred. Familiarity operates a kind of
   apotheosis, and the man becomes divinity, in simply being known.

   At first, he is the Son of Mary and the Nazarene carpenter. Next, he is
   heard speaking with authority, as contrasted even with the Scribes.
   Next, he is conceived by some to be certainly Elias, or some one of the
   prophets, returned in power to the world. Peter takes him up, at that
   point, as being certainly the Christ, the great mysterious Messiah;
   only not so great that he is not able to reprove him, when he begins to
   talk of being killed by his enemies; protesting "be it far from thee,
   Lord." But the next we see of the once bold apostle, he is beckoning to
   another, at the table, to whisper the Lord and ask who it is that is
   going to betray him; unable himself to so much as invade the sacred ear
   of his Master with the audible and open question. Then, shortly after,
   when he comes out of the hall of Caiaphas, flushed and flurried with
   his threefold lie, and his base hypocrisy of cursing, what do we see
   but that, simply catching the great Master's eye, his heart breaks
   down, riven with insupportable anguish, and is utterly dissolved in
   childish tears. And so it will be discovered in all the disciples, that
   Christ is more separated from them, and holds them in deeper awe, the
   closer he comes to them and the more perfectly they know him.

   The same, too, is true of his enemies. At first, they look on him only
   as some new fanatic, that has come to turn the heads of the people.
   Next, they want to know whence he drew his opinion, and his singular
   accomplishments in the matter of public address; not being, as all that
   knew him testify, an educated man. Next, they send out a company to
   arrest him, and, when they hear him speak, they are so deeply impressed
   that they dare not do it, but go back, under a kind of invincible awe,
   testifying--"never man spake like this man." Afterward, to break some
   fancied spell there may be in him, they hire one of his own friends to
   betray him; and even then, when they come directly before him and hear
   him speak, they are in such tremor of apprehension, lest he should
   suddenly annihilate them, that they reel incontinently backward and are
   pitched on the ground. Pilate trembles visibly before him, and the more
   because of his silence and his wonderful submission. And then, when the
   fatal deed is done, what do we see but that the multitude, awed by some
   dread mystery in the person of the crucified, return home smiting on
   their breasts for anguish, in the sense of what their infatuated and
   guilty rage has done.

   Our experience of men reverse in him. The most conspicuous matter,
   therefore, in the history of Jesus, is, that what holds true, in all
   our experience of men, is inverted in him. He grows sacred, peculiar,
   wonderful, divine, as acquaintance reveals him. At first he is only a
   man, as the senses report him to be; knowledge, observation,
   familiarity, raise him into the God-man. He grows pure and perfect,
   more than mortal in wisdom, a being enveloped in sacred mystery, a
   friend to be loved in awe--dies into awe, and a sorrow that contains
   the element of worship! And exactly this appears in the history,
   without any token of art, or even apparent consciousness that it does
   appear--appears because it is true. Probably no one of the evangelists
   ever so much as noticed this remarkable inversion of what holds good
   respecting men, in the life and character of Jesus. Is this character
   human, or is it plainly divine?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Recapitulation. We have now sketched some of the principal distinctions
   of the superhuman character of Jesus. We have seen him unfolding as a
   flower, from the germ of a perfect youth; growing up to enter into
   great scenes and have his part in great trials; harmonious in all with
   himself and truth, a miracle of celestial beauty. He is a Lamb in
   innocence, a God in dignity; revealing an impenitent but faultless
   piety, such as no mortal ever attempted, such as, to the highest of
   mortals, is inherently impossible. He advances the most extravagant
   pretensions, without any show of conceit, or even seeming fault of
   modesty. He suffers without affectation of composure and without
   restraint of pride; suffers as no mortal sensibility can, and where, to
   mortal view, there was no reason for pain at all; giving us not only an
   example of gentleness and patience in all the small trials of life, but
   revealing the depths even of the passive virtues of God, in his agony
   and the patience of his suffering love. He undertakes also a plan,
   universal in extent, perpetual in time; to unite all nations in a
   kingdom of righteousness under God; laying his foundations in the
   hearts of the poor, as no great teacher had ever done before, and yet
   without creating ever a faction, or stirring one partisan feeling in
   his followers. In his teachings he is perfectly original, distinct from
   his age and from all ages; never warped by the expectation of his
   friends; always in a balance of truth, swayed by no excesses, running
   to no oppositions or extremes; clear of all superstition, and equally
   clear of all liberalism; presenting the highest doctrines in the lowest
   and simplest forms; establishing a pure, universal morality, never
   before established; and, with all his intense devotion to the truth,
   never anxious, perceptibly, for the success of his doctrine. Finally,
   to sum up all in one, he grows more great and wise, and sacred, the
   more he is known--needs, in fact, to be known, to have his perfection
   seen. And we say, is Jesus, the Christ; manifestly not human, not of
   our world--some being who has burst into it, and is not of it. Call him
   for the present, that "Holy Thing," and say, "by this we believe that
   thou camest from God."

   Not to say that we are dissatisfied with this sketch, would be almost
   an irreverence of itself, to the subject of it. Who can satisfy himself
   with any thing that he can say of Jesus Christ? We have seen, how many
   pictures of the sacred person of Jesus, by the first masters; but not
   one, among them all, that did not rebuke the weakness which could dare
   attempt an impossible subject. So of the character of Jesus. It is
   necessary, for the holy interest of truth, that we should explore it,
   as we are best able; but what are human thoughts and human conceptions,
   on a subject that dwarfs all thought and immediately outgrows whatever
   is conceived. And yet, for the reason that we have failed, we seem also
   to have succeeded. For the more impossible it is found to be, to grasp
   the character and set it forth, the more clearly it is seen to be above
   our range--a miracle and a mystery.

   Did such a being actually exist? Two questions now remain, which our
   argument requires to be answered. And the first is this--did any such
   character, as this we have been tracing, actually exist? Admitting that
   the character, whether it be fact or fiction, is such as we have seen
   it to be, two supposition are open; either that such a character
   actually lived, and was possible to be described, because it furnished
   the matter of the picture, itself; or else, that Jesus, being a merely
   human character as he lived, was adorned to set off in this manner, by
   the exaggeration of fancy, and fable, and wild tradition afterward. In
   the former alternative, we have the insuperable difficulty of
   believing, that any so perfect and glorious character was ever attained
   to by a mortal. If Christ was a merely natural man, then was he under
   all the condition privative, as regards the security of his virtue,
   that we have discovered in man. He was a new-created being, as such to
   be perfected in a character of steadfast holiness, only by the
   experiment of evil and redemption from it. We can believe any miracle,
   therefore, more easily than that Christ was a man, and yet a perfect
   character, such as here is given.

   In the latter alternative, we have four different writers, widely
   distinguished in their style and mental habit--inferior persons, all,
   as regards their accomplishments, and none of them remarkable for gifts
   of genius--contributing their parts, and coalescing thus in the
   representation of a character perfectly harmonious with itself, and,
   withal, a character whose ideal no poet had been able to create, no
   philosopher, by the profoundest effort of thought, to conceive and set
   forth to the world. What is more, these four writers are, by the
   supposition, children all of credulity, retailing the absurd gossip and
   the fabulous stories of an age of marvels, and yet, by some accident,
   they are found to have conceived and sketched the only perfect
   character known to mankind. To believe this, requires a more credulous
   age than these writers ever saw. We fall back, then, upon our
   conclusion, and there we rest. Such was the real historic character of
   Jesus. Thus he lived; the character is possible to be conceived,
   because it was actualized in a living example. The only solution is
   that which is given try Jesus himself, when he says--"I came forth from
   the Father, and am come into the world."

   Was he a sinless character? The second question is this: whether this
   character is to be conceived as an actually existing sinless character
   in the world? That it is I maintain, because the character can no
   otherwise be accounted for in its known excellences. How was it that a
   simple-minded peasant of Galilee, was able to put himself in advance,
   in this manner, of all human teaching and excellence; unfolding a
   character so peculiar in its combinations, and so plainly impossible to
   any mere man of the race? Because his soul was filled with internal
   beauty and purity, having no spot, or stain, distorted by no obliquity
   of view or feeling, lapsing, therefore, into no eccentricity or
   deformity. We can make out no account of him so easy to believe, as
   that he was sinless; indeed, we can make no other account of him at
   all. He realized what are, humanly speaking, impossibilities; for his
   soul was warped and weakened by no human infirmities, doing all in a
   way of ease and naturalness, just because it is easy for clear waters
   to flow from a pure spring. To believe that Jesus got up these high
   conceptions artistically, and then acted them, in spite of the
   conscious disturbance of his internal harmony, and the conscious
   clouding of his internal purity by sin, would involve a degree of
   credulity and a want of perception, as regards the laws of the soul and
   their necessary action under sin, so lamentable as to be a proper
   subject of pity. We could sooner believe all the fables of the Talmud.

   Besides, if Jesus was a sinner, he was conscious of sin as all sinners
   are, and, therefore, was a hypocrite in the whole fabric of his
   character; realizing so muck of divine beauty in it, maintaining the
   show of such unfaltering harmony and celestial grace, and doing all
   this with a mind confused and fouled by the affectations acted for true
   virtues! Such an example of successful hypocrisy would be itself the
   greatest miracle ever heard of in the world.

   Furthermore, if Jesus was a sinner, then he was, of course, a fallen
   being; down under the bondage, distorted by the perversity of sin and
   its desolating effects, as men are. The root, therefore, of all his
   beauty is guilt. Evil has broken loose in him, he is held fast under
   evil. Bad thoughts are streaming through his soul in bad successions;
   his tempers have lost their tune; his affections have been touched by
   leprosy; remorse scowls upon his heart; his views have lost their
   balance and contracted obliquity; in a word, he is fallen. Is it then
   such a being, one who has been touched, in this manner, by the demon
   spell of evil--is it he that is unfolding such a character?

   Mr. Parker's estimate of him. What, then, do our critics in the school
   of naturalism say of this character of Christ? Of course they are
   obliged to say many handsome and almost saintly things of it. Mr.
   Parker says of him, that "He unites in himself the sublimed precepts
   and divinest practices, thus more than realizing the dream of prophets
   and sages; rises free from all prejudice of his age, nation, or sect;
   gives free range to the Spirit of God, in his breast; sets aside the
   law, sacred and true--honored as it was, its forms, its sacrifice, its
   temple, its priests; puts away the doctors of the law, subtle,
   irrefragable, and pours out a doctrine beautiful as the light, sublime
   as Heaven, and true as God." [5] Again--as if to challenge for his
   doctrine, the distinction of a really supernatural excellence--"Try him
   as we try other teachers. They deliver their word, find a few waiting
   for the consolation who accept the new tidings, follow the new method,
   and soon go beyond their teacher, though less mighty minds than he.
   Though humble men, we see what Socrates and Luther never saw. But
   eighteen centuries have passed since the Sun of humanity rose so high
   in Jesus; what man, what sect has mastered his thought, comprehended
   his method, and so fully applied it to life." [6]

   Mr. Hennel's estimate. Mr. Hennel, who writes in a colder mood, but
   has, on the whole, produced the ablest of all the arguments yet offered
   on this side, speaks more cautiously. He says, "Whilst no human
   character, in the history of the world, can be brought to mind, which,
   in proportion as it could be closely examined, did not present some
   defects, disqualifying it for being the emblem of moral perfection, we
   can rest, with least check or sense of incongruity, on the imperfectly
   known character of Jesus of Nazareth." [7]

   Faults charged. But the intimation here is, that the character is not
   perfect; it is only one in which the sense of perfection suffers "least
   check." And where is the fault charged? Why, it is discovered that
   Jesus cursed a fig-tree, in which he is seen to be both angry and
   unreasonable. He denounced the Pharisees in terms of bitter animosity.
   He also drove the money changers out of the temple with a scourge of
   rode, in which he is even betrayed into an act of physical violence.
   These and such like specks of fault are discovered, as they think, in
   the life of Jesus. So graceless in our conceit, have we of this age
   grown, that we can think it a point of scholarly dignity and reason, to
   spot the only perfect beauty that has ever graced our world, with such
   discovered blemishes as these! As if sin could ever need to be made out
   against a real sinner, in this small way of special pleading; or as if
   it were ever the way of sin to err in single particles or homoeopathic
   quantities of wrong! A more just sensibility would denounce this
   malignant style of criticism, as a heartless and really low-minded
   pleasure in letting down the honors of goodness.

   Faults supposed and intimated. In justice to Mr. Parker, it must be
   admitted that he does not actually charge these points of history as
   faults, or blemishes in the character of Jesus. And yet, in justice
   also, it must be added that he does compose a section under the
   heading--"The Negative Side, or the Limitations of Jesus,"--where
   these, with other like matters, are thrown in by insinuation, as
   possible charges sometimes advanced by others. For himself, he alleges
   nothing positive, but that Jesus was under the popular delusion of his
   time, in respect to devils or demoniacal possessions, and that he was
   mistaken in some of his references to the Old Testament. What, now, is
   to be thought of such material, brought forward under such a heading,
   to flaw such a character! Is it sure that Christ was mistaken in his
   belief of the foul spirits? Is it certain that a sufficient mode of
   interpretation will not clear his references of mistake? And so, when
   it is suggested, at second hand, that his invective is too fierce
   against the Pharisees, is there no escape, but to acknowledge that,
   "considering his youth, it was a venial error?" Or, if there be no
   charge but this, "at all affecting the moral and religious character of
   Jesus," should not a just reverence to one whose life is so nearly
   faultless, constrain us to look for some more favorable construction,
   that takes the solitary blemish away? Is it true that invective is a
   necessary token of ill-nature? Are there no occasions where even
   holiness will be most forward in it? And when a single men stands out
   alone, facing a whole living order and caste, that rule the
   time--oppressors of the poor, hypocrites and pretenders in religion,
   corrupters of all truth and faith, under the names of learning and
   religion--is the malediction, the woe, that he hurls against them, to
   be taken as a fault of violence and unregulated passion; or considering
   what amount of force and public influence he dares to confront and set
   in deadly enmity against his person, is he rather to be accepted as
   God's champion, in the honors of great and genuinely heroic spirit?

   His invective against the Pharisees. Considering how fond the world is
   of invective, how ready to admire the rhetoric of sharp words, how many
   speakers study to excel in the fine art of excoriation, how many
   reformers are applauded in vehement attacks on character, and win a
   great repute of fearlessness, just because of their severity, when, in
   fact, there is nothing to fear--when possibly the subject is a dead
   man, not yet buried--it is really a most striking tribute to the more
   than human character of Jesus, that we are found to be so apprehensive
   respecting him in particular, lest his plain, unstudied, unrhetorical
   severities on this or that occasion, may imply some possible defect, or
   "venial error," in him. Why this special sensibility to fault in him?
   save that, by his beautiful and perfect life, he has raised our
   conceptions so high as to make, what we might applaud in a man, a
   possible blemish in his divine excellence?

   The glorious old reformer and blind poet of Puritanism--vindicator of a
   free commonwealth and a free, unprelatical religion--holds, in our
   view, a far worthier and manlier conception of Christ's dealing with
   the Pharisees, and of what is due to all the usurpations of titled
   conceit and oppression in the world. With truly refreshing vehemence,
   he writes--"For in times of opposition, when against new heresies
   arising, or old corruptions to be reformed, this cool, impassionate
   mildness of positive wisdom, is not enough to damp and astonish the
   proud resistance of carnal and false doctors, then (that I may have
   leave to soar awhile, as the poets use,) Zeal, whose substance is
   ethereal, arming in complete diamond, ascends his fiery chariot, drawn
   by two blazing meteors figured like beasts, but of a higher breed than
   any the zodiac yields, resembling those four which Ezekiel and St. John
   saw--the one visaged like a lion, to express power, high authority, and
   indignation; the other of man, to cast derision and scorn upon perverse
   and fraudulent seducers--with them the invincible warrior, Zeal,
   shaking loosely the slack reins, drives over the heads of scarlet
   prelates and such as are insolent to maintain traditions, bruising
   their stiff necks under his flaming wheels. Thus did the true prophets
   of old combat with the false; thus Christ, himself the fountain of
   meekness, found acrimony enough to be still galling and vexing the
   prelatical Pharisee. But ye will say, these had immediate warrant from
   God to be thus bitter; and I say, so much the plainer is it found that
   there may be a sanctified bitterness against the enemies of the truth."
   [8]

   Probably Christ himself had no other account to give of his conduct, on
   the occasion referred to; and no other was needed, than that he felt a
   zeal within him (answering to Milton's picture), which could not, must
   not be repressed. His disciples felt his terrible severity, and were
   going to be shocked by it, but they remembered the Scripture--"The zeal
   of thy house hath eaten me up." After all, it was, when rightly viewed,
   the necessary outburst, only, of that indignant fire, which is kindled
   in the sweet bosom of innocence, by the insolence of hypocrisy and
   oppression.

   I conclude, then, (1.) that Christ actually lived, and bore the real
   character ascribed to him in the history. And (2.) that he was a
   sinless character. How far off is he now from any possible
   classification in the genus humanity!
     __________________________________________________________________

   The fact of his miracles implied. Here, then, is a being who has broken
   into the world, and is not of it; one who has come out from God, and is
   even an expression to us of the complete beauty of God--such as he
   should be, if he actually was, what he is affirmed to be, the Eternal
   Word of the Father incarnate. Did he work miracles? This now is the
   question that waits for our decision--did he work miracles? By the
   supposition, he is superhuman. By the supposition, too, he is in the
   world as a miracle. Agreeing that the laws of nature will not be
   suspended, any more than they are by our own supernatural action, will
   they yet be so subordinated to his power, as to permit the performance
   of signs and wonders, in which we may recognize a superhuman force?
   Since he is shown to be a superhuman being, manifestly nature will have
   a relation to him, under and by her own laws, such as accords with his
   superhuman quality, and it will be very singular if he does not do
   superhuman things; nay, it is even philosophically incredible that he
   should not, and that without any breach upon the integrity of nature.
   Thus an organ is a certain instrument, curiously framed or adjusted in
   its paste, and prepared to yield itself to any force which touches the
   keys. An animal runs back and forth across the key-board, and produces
   a jarring, disagreeable jumble of sounds. Thereupon he begins to
   reason, and convinces himself that it is in the nature of the
   instrument to make such sounds, and no other. But a skilful player
   comes to the instrument, as a higher presence, endowed with a
   super-animal sense and skill. He strikes the keys, and all-melodious
   and heavenly sounds roll out upon the enchanted air. Will the animal
   now go on to reason that this is impossible, incredible, because it
   violates the nature of the instrument, and is contrary to his own
   experience? Perhaps he may, and men may sometimes not be wiser than he.
   But the player himself, and all that can think it possible for him to
   do what the animal can not, will have no doubt that the music is made
   by the same laws that made the jargon. Just so Christ, to whose will or
   touch the mundane system is pliant as to ours, may be able to execute
   results through its very laws subordinated to him, which to us are
   impossible. Nay, it would be itself a contradiction of all order and
   fit relation if he could not. To suppose that a being out of humanity,
   will be shut up within all the limitations of humanity, is incredible,
   and contrary to reason. The very laws of nature themselves, having him
   present to them, as a new agent and higher first term, would require
   the development of new consequences and incidents, in the nature of
   wonders. Being a miracle himself, it would be the greatest of all
   miracles if he did not work miracles.

   His errand is order itself. Let it be further noted, that Christ is
   here on an errand high enough to justify his appearing, and also of a
   nature to exclude any suspicion that he is going to overthrow the order
   of God's works. He declares that he has come out from God, to be a
   restorer of sin, a regenerator of all things, a new moral creator of
   the world; thus to do a work that is, at once, the hope of all order,
   and the greatest of all miracle. He tells us, indeed, that he is come
   to set up the kingdom of God, and fulfil the highest ends of the divine
   goodness in the creation of the world itself; and the dignity of his
   work, certified by the dignity also of his character, sets all things
   in proportion, and commends him to our confidence in all the wonders he
   performs.

   No disruption of law or system. Nor shall we apprehend in his miracles
   any disruption of law; for we shall see that he is executing that true
   system, above nature and more comprehensive, which is itself the basis
   of all stability, and contains the reel import of all things. Dwelling
   from eternity in this higher system himself, and having it centred in
   his person, wheeling and subordinating thus all physical instruments,
   as doubtless he may, to serve those better ends in which all order
   lies, it will not be in us when he comes forth from the Father, on the
   Father's errand, to forbid that he shall work in the prerogatives of
   the Father. Visibly not one of us, but a visitant who has come out from
   a realm of spiritual majesty, back of the sensuous orb on which our
   moth-eyes dwell as in congenial dimness and obscurity of light, what
   shall we think when we see diseases fly before him, and blindness
   letting fall the scales of obscured vision, and death retreating from
   its prey, but that the seeming disruption of our retributive state
   under sin, is made to let in mercy and order from above? For, if man
   has buried himself in sense, and married all sense to sin, which sin is
   itself the soul of all disorder, can it be to us a frightful thing that
   he lays his hand upon the perverted casualties, and says, "thou art
   made whole?" If the bad empire, the bitter un-nature of our sin, is
   somewhere touched by his healing power, must we apprehend some fatal
   shock of disorder? If, by his miraculous force, some crevice is made in
   the senses, to let in the light of heaven's peace and order, must we
   tremble lest the scientific laws are shaken, and the scientific causes
   violated? Better is it to say--"This beginning of miracles did Jesus
   make in Galilee, and manifested forth his glory, and we believe in
   him." Glory breaks in through his incarnate person, to chase away the
   darkness. In him, peace and order descend to rebuild the realm below,
   they have maintained above. Sin, the damned miracle and misery of the
   groaning creation, yields to the stronger miracle of Jesus and his
   works, and the great good minds of this and the upper worlds behold
   integrity and rest returning, and the peace of universal empire secure.
   Out of the disorder that was, rises order; out of chaos, beauty. Amen!
   Alleluia! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth!

   The mythical hypothesis impossible. At the same time, it must not be
   overlooked, that the account which is made of the Christian miracles,
   by the critics who deny them, is itself impossible. It is that they are
   myths or legendary tales, that grew up out of the story-telling and
   marvelling habit of the disciples of Christ, within the first thirty
   years after their Master's death. They were developed, in other words,
   in the lifetime of the eye-witnesses of Christ's ministry, and recorded
   by eye-witnesses themselves. We are also required to believe that four
   common men are able to preserve such a character as that of Christ,
   while loading down the history thus, with so many mythical wonders that
   are the garb of their very grotesque and childish credulity! By what
   accident, then, we are compelled to ask, was an age of myths and fables
   able to develop and set forth the only conception of a perfect
   character ever known in our world? Were these four mythological
   dreamers, believing their own dreams and all others beside, the men to
   produce the perfect character of Jesus, and a system of teachings that
   transcend all other teachings ever given to the race? If there be a
   greater miracle, or a tax on human credulity more severe, we know not
   where it is. Nothing is so difficult, ell human literature testifies,
   as to draw a character, and keep it in its living proportions. How much
   more to draw a perfect character, and not discolor it fatally by marks
   from the imperfection of the biographer. How is it, then, that four
   humble men, in an age of marvels and Rabbinical exaggerations, have
   done it--done what none, not even the wisest and greatest of mankind,
   have ever been able to do?

   Their success Mr. Parker concedes. So far, even Mr. Parker concedes the
   right of my argument. "Measure," he says, "the religious doctrine of
   Jesus by that of the time and place he lived in, or that of any time
   and any place. Yes, by the doctrine of eternal truth. Consider what a
   work his words and deeds have wrought in the world. Remember that the
   greatest minds have seen no farther, and added nothing to the doctrine
   of religion; that the richest hearts have felt no deeper, and added
   nothing to the sentiment of religion; have set no loftier aim, no truer
   method than his, of perfect love to God and man. Measure him by the
   shadow he has cast into the world--no, by the light he has shed upon
   it. Shall we be told such a man never lived? the whole story is a lie?
   Suppose that Plato and Newton never lived. But who did their wonders,
   and who thought their thought? It takes a Newton to forge a Newton.
   What man could have fabricated a Jesus? None but a Jesus." [9]

   Exactly so. And yet, in the middle of the very paragraph from which
   these words are gleaned, Mr. Parker says, "We can learn few facts about
   Jesus"; also, that in certain things--to wit, his miracles, we
   suppose--"Hercules was his equal, and Vishnu his superior." Few facts
   about Jesus! all the miracles recited of him, as destitute of
   credibility as the stories of Hercules and Vishnu! And yet these
   evangelists, retailing so many absurd fictions and so much childish
   gossip, have been able to give us a doctrine upon which the world has
   never advanced, a character so deep that the richest hearts have felt
   nothing deeper, and added nothing to the sentiment of it. They have
   done, that is, the difficult thing, and broken down under the easy!
   preserved, in the life and discourses of Jesus, what exceeds all human
   philosophy, all mortal beauty, and yet have not been able to recite the
   simplest facts! Is it so that any intelligent critic will reason?

   The miracles are in place in a gospel. Neither let it be objected that,
   since the miracles have in themselves no moral quality, there is no
   rational, or valuable, or even proper place for them in a gospel,
   considered as a new-creating grace for the world. For it is a thing of
   no secondary importance for a sinner, down under sin, and held fast in
   its bitter terms of bondage, to see that God has entered into his case
   with a force that is adequate. These mighty works of Jesus, which have
   been done and duly certified, are fit expressions to us of the fact
   that he can do for us all that we want Doubtless it is a great and
   difficult thing to regenerate a fallen nature; no person, really awake
   to his miserable and dreadful bondage, ever thought otherwise. But he
   that touched the blind eyes and commanded the leprosy away, he that
   trod the sea, and raised the dead, and burst the bars of death himself,
   can tame the passions, sweeten the bitter affections, regenerate the
   inbred diseases, and roll back all the storms of the mind. Assured in
   this manner by his miracles, they become arguments of trust, a
   storehouse of powerful images, that invigorate courage and stimulate
   hope. Broken as we are by our sorrow, cast down as we are by our
   guiltiness, ashamed, and weak, and ready to despair, we can yet venture
   a hope that our great soul-miracle may be done; that, if we can but
   touch the hem of Christ's garment, a virtue will go out of him to heal
   us. In all dark days and darker struggles of the mind, in all outward
   disasters, and amid all storms upon the sea of life, we can yet descry
   him treading the billows, and hear him saying, "It is I, be not
   afraid." And lest we should believe the miracles faintly, for there is
   a busy infidel lurking always in our hearts to cheat us of our faith,
   when he cannot reason it away, the character of Jesus in ever shining
   with and through them, in clear self-evidence, leaving them never to
   stand as raw wonders only of might, but covering them with glory, as
   tokens of a heavenly love, and note that only suit the proportions of
   his personal greatness and majesty.

   There are many in our day, as we know, who, without making any
   speculative point of the objection we are discussing, have so far
   yielded to the current misbelief as to profess, with a certain air of
   self-compliment, that they are quite content to accept the spirit of
   Jesus; and let the miracles go for what they are worth. Little figure
   will they make as Christians in that kind of gospel. They will not, in
   fact, receive the spirit of Jesus; for that, unabridged, is itself the
   Grand Miracle of Christianity, about which all the others play as
   scintillations only of the central fire. Still less will they believe
   that Jesus can do any thing in them which their sin requires. They will
   only compliment his beauty, imitate or ape his ways in a feeble lifting
   of themselves, but that he can roll back the currents of nature,
   loosened by the disorders of sin and raise them to a new birth in
   holiness, they will not believe. No such watery gospel of imitation,
   separated from grace, will have any living power in their life, or set
   them in any bond of unity with God. Nothing but to say--"Jesus of
   Nazareth, a man approved of God by miracles and signs which God did by
   him," can draw the soul to faith, and open it to the power of a
   supernatural and new-creative mercy.

   Jesus himself the all-sufficient evidence. We come back, then, to the
   self-evidencing superhuman character of Jesus, and there we rest. He is
   the sun that holds all the minor orbs of revelation to their places,
   and pours a sovereign, self-evidencing light into all religious
   knowledge. We have been debating much, and ranging over a wide field,
   in chase of the many phantoms of doubt and false argument, still we
   have not far to go for light, if only we could cease debating and sit
   down to see. It is no ingenious fetches of argument that we want; no
   external testimony, gathered here and there from the records of past
   ages, suffices to end our doubts; but it is the new sense opened in us
   by Jesus himself--a sense deeper than words and more immediate than
   inference--of the miraculous grandeur of his life; a glorious agreement
   felt between his works and his person, such that his miracles
   themselves are proved to us in our feeling, believed in by that inward
   testimony. On this inward testimony we are willing to stake every
   thing, even the life that now is, and that which is to come. If the
   miracles, if revelation itself, can not stand upon the superhuman
   ohmmeter of Jesus, then let it fall. If that character does not contain
   all truth and centralize all truth in itself, then let there be no
   truth. If there is any thing worthy of belief not found in this, we may
   well consent to live and die without it. Before this sovereign light,
   streaming out from God, the deep questions, and dark surmises, and
   doubts unresolved, which make a night so gloomy and terrible about us,
   hurry away to their native abyss. God, who commanded the light to shine
   out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
   knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. This it is
   that has conquered the assaults of doubt and false learning in all past
   ages, and will in all ages to come. No argument against the sun will
   drive it from the sky. No mole-eyed skepticism, dazzled by its
   brightness, can turn away the shining it refuses to look upon. And they
   who long after God, will be ever turning their eyes thitherward, and
   either with reason or without reason, or, if need be, against manifold
   impediments of reason, will see and believe.
     __________________________________________________________________

   But before we drop a theme like this, let us note more distinctly the
   immense significance to our religious feeling of this glorious advent
   of Jesus, and have our congratulations in it, This one perfect
   character has come into our world, and lived in it; filling all the
   molds of action, all the terms of duty and love, with his own divine
   manners, works and charities. All the conditions of our life are raised
   thus, by the meaning he has shown to be in them, and the grace he has
   put upon them. The world itself is changed, and is no more the same
   that it was; it has never been the same since Jesus left it. The air is
   charged with heavenly odors, and a kind of celestial consciousness, a
   sense of other worlds, is wafted on us in its breath. Let the dark ages
   come, let society roll backward and churches perish in whole regions of
   the earth, let infidelity deny, and, what is worse, let spurious piety
   dishonor the truth; still there is a something here that was not, and a
   something that has immortality in it. Still our confidence remains
   unshaken, that Christ and his all-quickening life are in the world, as
   fixed elements, and will be to the end of time; for Christianity is not
   so much the advent of a better doctrine, as of a perfect character; and
   how can a perfect character, once entered into life and history, be
   separated and finally expelled? It were easier to untwist all the beams
   of light in the sky, separating and expunging one of the colors, than
   to get the character of Jesus, which is the real gospel, out of the
   world. Look ye hither, meantime, all ye blinded and fallen of mankind,
   a better nature is among you, a pure heart, out of some pure world, is
   come into your prison and walks it with you. Do you require of us to
   show who he is, and definitely to expound his person? We may not be
   able. Enough to know that he is not of us--some strange being out of
   nature and above it, whose name is Wonderful. Enough that sin has never
   touched his hallowed nature, and that he is a friend. In him dawns a
   hope--purity has not come into the world, except to purify. Behold the
   Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world! Light breaks in,
   peace settles on the air, lo! the prison walls are giving way--rise,
   let us go.

  END.
