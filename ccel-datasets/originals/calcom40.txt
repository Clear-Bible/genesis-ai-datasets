     __________________________________________________________________

   1 Corinthians 15:1-10

   1. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
   unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

   1. Notum autem vobis facio, fratres, evangelium quod evangelizavi
   vobis, quod et recepistis, in quo etiam stetistis.

   2. By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
   unto you, unless ye have believed in vain:

   2. Per quod etiam salutem habetis: quo pacto annuntiarim vobis, si
   tenetis, nisi frustra credidistis.

   3. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
   how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

   3. Tradidi enim vobis imprimis quod et acceperam, quod Christus mortuus
   fuerit, pro peccatis nostris secundum Scripturas,

   4. And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
   according to the scriptures:

   4. Et quod sepultus sit, et quod resurrexit tertio die, secundum
   Scripturas.

   5. And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

   5. Et quod visus fait Cephae, deinde ipsis duodecim:

   6. After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of
   whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen
   asleep.

   6. Postea visus fait plus quam qaingentis fratribus simul, ex quibus
   plures manent [1] adhuc ad hunc usque diem: qaidam autem obdormierunt.

   7. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

   7. Deinde visus fait Iacobo: post apostolis omnibus:

   8. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
   time.

   8. Postremo vero onmium, velut abortivo, visus fait et mihi.

   9. For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

   9. Ego enim sum minimus apostolorum, qui non sum idoneus ut dicar
   apostolus: quandoquidem persequutus sum ecclesiam Dei.

   10. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
   bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
   they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

   10. Sed gratia Dei sum id quod sum: et gratia ejus, quae mihi collata
   est, non fuit inanis, sed copiosius quam illi omnes laboravi: non ego
   tamen, sed gratia Dei quae mihi aderat.


   1. Now I make known to you. He now enters on another subject -- the
   resurrection -- the belief of which among the Corinthians had been
   shaken by some wicked persons. It is uncertain, however, whether they
   doubted merely as to the ultimate resurrection of the body, or as to
   the immortality of the soul also. It is abundantly well known, that
   there were a variety of errors as to this point. Some philosophers
   contended that souls are immortal. As to the resurrection of the body,
   it never entered into the mind of any one of them. The Sadducees,
   however, had grosser views; for they thought of nothing but the present
   life; nay more, they thought that the soul of man was a breath of wind
   without substance. It is not, therefore, altogether certain (as I have
   already said) whether the Corinthians had at this time gone to such a
   height of madness, as to cast off all expectation of a future life, or
   whether they merely denied the resurrection of the body; for the
   arguments which Paul makes use of seem to imply, that they were
   altogether bewitched with the mad dream of the Sadducees.

   For example, when he says,

   Of what advantage is it to be baptized for the dead?
   (1 Corinthians 15:29.)

   Were it not better to eat and to drink?
   (1 Corinthians 15:32.)

   Why are we in peril every hour? (1 Corinthians 15:30,)

   and the like, it might very readily be replied, in accordance with the
   views of the philosophers, "Because after death the soul survives the
   body." Hence some apply the whole of Paul's reasoning contained in this
   chapter to the immortality of the soul. For my part, while I leave
   undetermined what the error of the Corinthians was, yet I cannot bring
   myself to view Paul's words as referring to anything else than the
   resurrection of the body. Let it, therefore be regarded as a settled
   point, that it is of this exclusively that he treats in this chapter.
   And what if the impiety of Hymeneus and Philetus had extended thus far,
   [2] who said that the resurrection was already past, (2 Timothy 2:18,)
   and that there would be nothing more of it? Similar to these, there are
   at the present day some madmen, or rather devils, [3] who call
   themselves Libertines. [4] To me, however, the following conjecture
   appears more probable -- that they were carried away by some delusion,
   [5] which took away from them the hope of a future resurrection, just
   as those in the present day, by imagining an allegorical resurrection,
   [6] take away from us the true resurrection that is promised to us.

   However this may be, it is truly a dreadful case, and next to a
   prodigy, that those who had been instructed by so distinguished a
   master, should have been capable of falling so quickly [7] into errors
   of so gross a nature. But what is there that is surprising in this,
   when in the Israelitish Church the Sadducees had the audacity to
   declare openly that man differs nothing from a brute, in so far as
   concerns the essence of the soul, and has no enjoyment but what is
   common to him with the beasts? Let us observe, however, that blindness
   of this kind is a just judgment from God, so that those who do not rest
   satisfied with the truth of God, are tossed hither and thither by the
   delusions of Satan.

   It is asked, however, why it is that he has left off or deferred to the
   close of the Epistle, what should properly have had the precedence of
   everything else? Some reply, that this was done for the purpose of
   impressing it more deeply upon the memory. I am rather of opinion that
   Paul did not wish to introduce a subject of such importance, until he
   had asserted his authority, which had been considerably lessened among
   the Corinthians, and until he had, by repressing their pride, prepared
   them for listening to him with docility.

   I make known to you. To make known here does not mean to teach what was
   previously unknown to them, but to recall to their recollection what
   they had heard previously. "Call to your recollection, along with me,
   that gospel which you had learned, before you were led aside from the
   right course." He calls the doctrine of the resurrection the gospel,
   that they may not imagine that any one is at liberty to form any
   opinion that he chooses on this point, as on other questions, which
   bring with them no injury to salvation.

   When he adds, which I preached to you, he amplifies what he had said:
   "If you acknowledge me as an apostle, I have assuredly taught you so."
   There is another amplification in the words -- which also ye have
   received, for if they now allow themselves to be persuaded of the
   contrary, they will be chargeable with fickleness. A third
   amplification is to this effect, that they had hitherto continued in
   that belief with a firm and steady resolution, which is somewhat more
   than that they had once believed. But the most important thing of all
   is, that he declares that their salvation is involved in this, for it
   follows from this, that, if the resurrection is taken away, they have
   no religion left them, no assurance of faith, and in short, have no
   faith remaining. Others understand in another sense the word stand, as
   meaning that they are upheld; but the interpretation that I have given
   is a more correct one. [8]

   2. If you keep in memory -- unless in vain [9] These two expressions
   are very cutting. In the first, he reproves their carelessness or
   fickleness, because such a sudden fall was an evidence that they had
   never understood what had been delivered to them, or that their
   knowledge of it had been loose and floating, inasmuch as it had so
   quickly vanished. By the second, he warns them that they had needlessly
   and uselessly professed allegiance to Christ, if they did not hold fast
   this main doctrine. [10]

   3. For I delivered to you first of all He now confirms what he had
   previously stated, by explaining that the resurrection had been
   preached by him, and that too as a fundamental doctrine of the gospel.
   First of all, says he, as it is wont to be with a foundation in the
   erecting of a house. At the same time he adds to the authority of his
   preaching, when he subjoins, that he delivered nothing but what he had
   received, for he does not simply mean that he related what he had from
   the report of others, but that it was what had been enjoined upon him
   by the Lord. [11] For the word [12] must be explained in accordance
   with the connection of the passage. Now it is the duty of an apostle to
   bring forward nothing but what he has received from the Lord, so as
   from hand to hand [13] (as they say) to administer to the Church the
   pure word of God.

   That Christ died, etc. See now more clearly whence he received it, for
   he quotes the Scriptures in proof. In the first place, he makes mention
   of the death of Christ, nay also of his burial, that we may infer,
   that, as he was like us in these things, he is so also in his
   resurrection. He has, therefore, died with us that we may rise with
   him. In his burial, too, the reality of the death in which he has taken
   part with us, is made more clearly apparent. Now there are many
   passages of Scripture in which Christ's death and resurrection are
   predicted, but nowhere more plainly [14] than in Isaiah 53, in Daniel
   9:26, and in Psalm 22

   For our sins That is, that by taking our curse upon him he might redeem
   us from it. For what else was Christ's death, but a sacrifice for
   expiating our sins -- what but a satisfactory penalty, by which we
   might be reconciled to God -- what but the condemnation of one, for the
   purpose of obtaining forgiveness for us? He speaks also in the same
   manner in Romans 4:25, but in that passage, on the other hand, he
   ascribes it also to the resurrection as its effect -- that it confers
   righteousness upon us; for as sin was done away through the death of
   Christ, so righteousness is procured through his resurrection. This
   distinction must be carefully observed, that we may know what we must
   look for from the death of Christ, and what from his resurrection.
   When, however, the Scripture in other places makes mention only of his
   death, let us understand that in those cases his resurrection is
   included in his death, but when they are mentioned separately, the
   commencement of our salvation is (as we see) in the one, and the
   consummation of it in the other.

   5. That he was seen by Cephas He now brings forward eye witnesses,
   (autoptas) as they are called by Luke, (Luke 1:2,) who saw the
   accomplishment of what the Scriptures had foretold would take place. He
   does not, however, adduce them all, for he makes no mention of women.
   When, therefore, he says that he appeared first to Peter, you are to
   understand by this that he is put before all the men, so that there is
   nothing inconsistent with this in the statement of Mark (Mark 16:9)
   that he appeared to Mary.

   But how is it that he says, that he appeared to the twelve, when, after
   the death of Judas, there were only eleven remaining? Chrysostom is of
   opinion that this took place after Matthias had been chosen in his
   room. Others have chosen rather to correct the expression, looking upon
   it as a mistake [15] But as we know, that there were twelve in number
   that were set apart by Christ's appointment, though one of them had
   been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing that
   the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men at
   Rome that were called Centumviri, [16] while they were in number 102.
   [17] By the twelve, therefore, you are simply to understand the chosen
   Apostles.

   It does not quite appear when it was that this appearing to more than
   five hundred took place. Only it is possible that this large multitude
   assembled at Jerusalem, when he manifested himself to them. For Luke
   (Luke 24:33) makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had
   assembled with the eleven; but how many there were he does not say.
   Chrysostom refers it to the ascension, and explains the word epano to
   mean, from on high. [18] Unquestionably, as to what he says in
   reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been
   subsequently to the ascension.

   By all the Apostles I understand not merely the twelve, but also those
   disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the
   gospel. [19] In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should
   be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently
   testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more surely
   believed among us. (Luke 1:1.) Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves
   the resurrection of Christ from the fact that he appeared to many, he
   intimates by this, that it was not figurative but true and natural, for
   the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of a spiritual resurrection.

   8. Last of all to me, as to one born prematurely, He now introduces
   himself along with the others, for Christ had manifested himself to him
   as alive, and invested with glory. [20] As it was no deceptive vision,
   it was calculated to be of use [21] for establishing a belief in the
   resurrection, as he also makes use of this argument in Acts 26:8. But
   as it was of no small importance that his authority should have the
   greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by
   the way, a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time
   qualified in such a manner that, while he claims much for himself, he
   is at the same time exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should
   meet him with the objection: "Who art thou that we should give credit
   to thee?" he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in
   the first place, indeed he compares himself to one that is born
   prematurely, and that, in my opinion, with reference to his sudden
   conversion. For as infants do not come forth from the womb, until they
   have been there formed and matured during a regular course of time, so
   the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and
   forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from
   the womb when he had scarcely received the vital spark. [22] There are
   some that understand the term rendered abortive as employed to mean
   posthumous; [23] but the former term is much more suitable, inasmuch as
   he was in one moment begotten, and born, and a man of full age. Now
   this premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul
   than if he had by little and little, and by successive steps, grown up
   to maturity in Christ.

   9. For I am the least It is not certain whether his enemies threw out
   this for the purpose of detracting from his credit, or whether it was
   entirely of his own accord, that he made the acknowledgment. For my
   part, while I have no doubt that, he was at all times voluntarily, and
   even cheerfully, disposed to abase himself, that he might magnify the
   grace of God, yet I suspect that in this instance he wished to obviate
   calumnies. For that there were some at Corinth that made it their aim
   to detract from his dignity by malicious slander, may be inferred not
   only from many foregoing passages, but also from his adding a little
   afterwards a comparison, which he would assuredly never have touched
   upon, if he had not been constrained to it by the wickedness of some,
   "Detract from me as much as you please -- I shall suffer myself to be
   cast down below the ground -- I shall suffer myself to be of no account
   whatever, [24] that the goodness of God towards me may shine forth the
   more. Let me, therefore, be reckoned the least of the Apostles: nay
   more, I acknowledge myself to be unworthy of this distinction. For by
   what merits could I have attained to that honor? When I persecuted the
   Church of God, what did I merit? But there is no reason why you should
   judge of me according to my own worth, [25] for the Lord did not look
   to what I was, but made me by his grace quite another man." The sum is
   this, that Paul does not refuse to be the most worthless of all, and
   next to nothing, provided this contempt does not impede him in any
   degree in his ministry, and does not at all detract from his doctrine.
   He is contented that, as to himself, he shall be reckoned unworthy of
   any honor, provided only he commends his apostleship in respect of the
   grace conferred upon him. And assuredly God had not adorned him with
   such distinguished endowments in order that his grace might lie buried
   or neglected, but he had designed thereby to render his apostleship
   illustrious and distinguished.

   10. And his grace was not vain. Those that set free-will in opposition
   to the grace of God, that whatever good we do may not be ascribed
   wholly to Him, wrest these words to suit their own interpretation -- as
   if Paul boasted, that he had by his own industry taken care that God's
   grace toward him had not been misdirected. Hence they infer, that God,
   indeed, offers his grace, but that the right use of it is in man's own
   power, and that it is in his own power to prevent its being
   ineffectual. I maintain, however, that these words of Paul give no
   support to their error, for he does not here claim anything as his own,
   as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything praiseworthy.
   What then? That he might not seem to glory to no purpose in mere words,
   while devoid of reality, he says, that he affirms nothing that is not
   openly apparent. Farther, even admitting that these words intimate,
   that Paul did not abuse the grace of God, and did not render it
   ineffectual by his negligence, I maintain, nevertheless, that there is
   no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God the
   praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God, inasmuch as he confers
   upon us not merely the power of doing well, but also the inclination
   and the accomplishment.

   But more abundantly Some refer this to vain-glorious boasters, [26]
   who, by detracting from Paul, endeavored to set off themselves and
   their goods to advantage, as, in their opinion at least, it is not
   likely that he wished to enter upon a contest with the Apostles. When
   he compares himself, however, with the Apostles, he does so merely for
   the sake of those wicked persons, who were accustomed to bring them
   forward for the purpose of detracting from his reputation, as we see in
   the Epistle to the Galatians (Galatians 1:11.) Hence the probability
   is, that it is of the Apostles that he speaks, when he represents his
   own labors as superior to theirs, and it is quite true, that he was
   superior to others, not merely in respect of his enduring many
   hardships, encountering many dangers, abstaining from things lawful,
   and perseveringly despising all perils; (2 Corinthians 11:26;) but also
   because the Lord gave to his labors a much larger measure of success.
   [27] For I take labor here to mean the fruit of his labor that
   appeared.

   Not I, but the grace The old translator, by leaving out the article,
   has given occasion of mistake to those that are not acquainted with the
   Greek language, for in consequence of his having rendered the words
   thus -- not I, but the grace of God with me, [28] they thought that
   only the half of the praise is ascribed to God, and that the other half
   is reserved for man. They, accordingly, understand the meaning to be
   that Paul labored not alone, inasmuch as he could do nothing without
   co-operating grace, [29] but at the same time it was under the
   influence of his own free-will, and by means of his own strength. His
   words, however, have quite a different meaning, for what he had said
   was his own, he afterwards, correcting himself, ascribes wholly to the
   grace of God -- wholly, I say, not in part, for whatever he might have
   seemed to do, was wholly, he declares, the work of grace. A remarkable
   passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for
   magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he
   had improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what
   he had said, and declares the grace of God to have been the efficient
   cause of the whole. Let us not think that there is here a mere pretense
   of humility [30] It is in good earnest that he speaks thus, and from
   knowing that it is so in truth. Let us learn, therefore, that we have
   nothing that is good, but what the Lord has graciously given us, that
   we do nothing good but what he worketh in us, (Philippians 2:13) -- not
   that we do nothing ourselves, but that we do nothing without being
   influenced -- that is, under the guidance and impulse of the Holy
   Spirit.

   [15] Granville Penn supposes that the common reading eita tois dodeka
   then to the twelve, is a corruption for eita tois de deka -- and then
   to the ten, understanding the Apostle as meaning, that Christ appeared
   first to Cephas, and then to the other ten. Dr. Adam Clarke, after
   stating that "instead of dodeka, twelve, hendeka, eleven is the reading
   of D* E F G, Syriac in the margin, some of the Slavonic, Armenian,
   Vulgate, Itala, and several of the Fathers," and that "this reading is
   supported by Mark 16:14," remarks: "Perhaps the term twelve is used
   here merely to point out the society of the Apostles. who, though at
   this time they were only eleven, were still called the twelve, because
   this was their original number, and a number which was afterwards
   filled up." "The twelve was a name not of number, but of office. --
   McKnight. -- Ed.

   [16] "C'est a dire, les Cents;" -- "That is to say, the Hundred."

   [17] The reader will find the same term referred to by Calvin when
   commenting on 1 Corinthians 10:8. (See Calvin on the Corinthians,
   [3]vol. 1, p. 324, n. 3.) -- Ed.

   [18] "This peculiar use of epano for ploion, (which seems to have been
   popular or provincial, not being found in the Classical writers,)
   occurs also in Mark 14:5, but with a genitive. Perhaps, however, it has
   properly no regimen, but is used parenthetically, like the Latin plus
   trecentos, 300 and more." -- Bloomfield. The word opano is used in a
   similar way in the Septuagint. Thus in Exodus 30:14 apo eikosaetous kai
   epano -- from twenty years old and above, and in Leviticus 27:7, apo
   hexekontaeton kai epano -- from sixty years old and above. -- Ed.

   [19] Calvin's view accords with that of Chrysostom, who says, esan gar
   kai alloi apostoloi hos hoi heibdomekonta -- "for there were also other
   Apostles, such as the seventy." -- Ed.

   [20] "En sa vie et gloire immortelle;" -- "In his life and immortal
   glory."

   [21] "Elle estoit suffisante et receuable;" -- "It was sufficient and
   admissible."

   [22] In accordance with the view taken by Calvin, Bloomfield considers
   the original term. ektroma to mean, a child born before the due time,
   (in which sense the term abortivus, is employed by Horace, Sat.
   1:3.46,) the Apostle "calling himself so as being an Apostle not formed
   and matured by previous preparation and instruction." Penn, after
   quoting the definition given by Eustathius of the term ektroma -- to
   mepo tetupomenon -- an unformed foetus, remarks: "To all the other
   Apostles our Lord appeared after his resurrection, when they had
   attained their adult form in his ministry; but to St. Paul he appeared
   at the first moment of his spiritual conception, and before he was
   formed or moulded." The same view, in substance, is given by McKnight.
   "Although he" (Paul) "calls himself an abortive Apostle, it was not on
   account of his being sensible of any imperfection in his commission, or
   of any weakness in his qualifications as an Apostle; for he affirms, 2
   Corinthians 11:5, that he was in nothing behind the very greatest of
   the Apostles; but he called himself an abortive Apostle, because, as he
   tells us (1 Corinthians 15:9,) he had persecuted the Church of God, and
   because he was made an Apostle without that previous course of
   instruction and preparation, which the other Apostles enjoyed who had
   attended Jesus Christ during his ministry on earth; so that, in the
   proper sense of the word, he was ektroma -- born before he was brought
   to maturity. That want, however, was abundantly supplied by the many
   revelations which his master gave him after he made him an Apostle." --
   Ed.

   [23] "C'est a dire qui est nay apres la mort de son pete;" -- "That is
   to say, one that is born after the death of his father."

   [30] Heideggerus seems to have had Calvin's exposition here in his view
   in the following observations on the expression made use of by the
   Apostle: "Non Gratia Dei meoum, uti vetus Itala vertit, quasi effectus
   inter Gra-tiam Dei, et Pauli arbitrium distribueretur; nihil enim
   habuit ipse, quod non acceperit; sed Ouk ego de, alla he charis tou
   Theou sun emoi mecum, ut totum et in solidum omne gratiae soli acceptum
   feratur. Neque ita loquitur solius humilitatis et modestiae explieandae
   ergo, quanquam et hanc testari voluit; sed quia po-tens illa gratia
   demonstratio et testimonium irrefragabile erat resurrectionis Domini."
   -- "Not the grace of God with me, as the old Italic version renders it,
   as though the effect were divided between God's grace and Paul's
   free-will; for he has nothing that he has not received, but he sun
   emoi, which with me, that every thing may be wholly and entirely
   ascribed to grace alone. Nor does he speak thus, merely for the purpose
   of showing humility and modesty, though he had it also in view to
   testify this, but because that grace was a powerful demonstration and
   irrefragable testimony of our Lord's resurrection." -- Heideggeri

   1 Corinthians 15:11-19

   11. Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
   believed.

   11. Sire ego igitur, sive illi, ita praedicamus, et ita credidistis.

   12. Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
   among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

   12. Si autem Christus praedicatur excitatus a mortuis, quomodo dicunt
   quidam, mortuorum resurrectionem non esse?

   13. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
   risen:

   13. Si autem mortuorum resur-rectionon est, neque Christus resurrexit.

   14. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
   faith is also vain.

   14. Quodsi Christus non resurrexit, inanis igitur est praedicatio
   nostra, inanis et fides vestra.

   15. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
   testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so
   be that the dead rise not.

   15. Invenimur etiam falsi testes Dei, quia testati sumus a Deo, quod
   suscitaverit Christum; quem non suscitavit, siquidem mortui non
   resurgunt.

   16. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

   16. Si enim mortui non resurgunt, neque Christus resurrexit.

   17. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
   sins.

   17. Si autem Christus non resurrexit, vana est fides vestra: adhuc
   estis in peccatis vestris.

   18. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

   18. Ergo et qui obdormierunt in Christo perierunt.

   19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable.

   19. Quodsi in hac vita solum speramus in Christo, miserrimi sumus
   omnium hominum.


   11. Whether I or they Having compared himself with the other Apostles,
   he now associates himself with them, and them with him, in agreement as
   to their preaching. "I do not now speak of myself, but we have all
   taught so with one mouth, and still continue to teach so." For the verb
   kerussomen (we preach) is in the present tense -- intimating a
   continued act, or perseverance in teaching. [31] "If, then, it is
   otherwise, our apostleship is void: nay more -- so ye believed: your
   religion, therefore, goes for nothing."

   12. But of Christ. He now begins to prove the resurrection of all of us
   from that of Christ. For a mutual and reciprocal inference holds good
   on the one side and on the other, both affirmatively and negatively --
   from Christ to us in this way: If Christ is risen, then we will rise --
   If Christ is not risen, then we will not rise -- from us to Christ on
   the other hand: If we rise, then Christ is risen -- If we do not rise,
   then neither is Christ risen. The ground-work of the argument to be
   drawn from Christ to us in the former inference is this: "Christ did
   not die, or rise again for himself, but for us: hence his resurrection
   is the foundation. [32] of ours, and what was accomplished in him, must
   be fulfilled in us also." In the negative form, on the other hand, it
   is thus: "Otherwise he would have risen again needlessly and to no
   purpose, because the fruit of it is to be sought, not in his own
   person, but in his members."

   Observe the ground-work, on the other hand, of the former inference to
   be deduced from us to him; for the resurrection is not from nature, and
   comes from no other quarter than from Christ alone. For in Adam we die,
   and we recover life only in Christ; hence it follows that his
   resurrection is the foundation of ours, so that if that is taken away,
   it cannot stand [33] The ground-work of the negative inference has been
   already stated; for as he could not have risen again but on our
   account, his resurrection would be null and void, [34] if it were of no
   advantage to us.

   14. Then is our preaching vain -- not simply as having some mixture of
   falsehood, but as being altogether an empty fallacy. For what remains
   if Christ has been swallowed up by death -- if he has become extinct --
   if he has been overwhelmed by the curse of sin -- if, in fine, he has
   been overcome by Satan? In short, if that fundamental article is
   subverted, all that remains will be of no moment. For the same reason
   he adds, that their faith will be vain, for what solidity of faith will
   there be, where no hope of life is to be seen? But in the death of
   Christ, considered in itself, [35] there is seen nothing but ground of
   despair, for he cannot be the author of salvation to others, who has
   been altogether vanquished by death. Let us therefore bear in mind,
   that the entire gospel consists mainly in the death and resurrection of
   Christ, so that we must direct our chief attention to this, if we would
   desire, in a right and orderly manner, to make progress in the gospel
   -- nay more, if we would not remain barren and unfruitful. (2 Peter
   1:8.)

   15. We are also found to be false witnesses. The other disadvantages,
   it is true, which he has just now recounted, were more serious, as
   regards us -- that faith was made vain -- that the whole doctrine of
   the gospel was useless and worthless, and that we were bereft of all
   hope of salvation. Yet this also was no trivial absurdity -- that the
   Apostles, who were ordained by God to be the heralds of his eternal
   truth, were detected as persons who had deceived the world with
   falsehoods; for this tends to God's highest dishonor.

   The expression, false witnesses of God, we may understand in two ways
   -- either that by lying they used the name of God under a false
   pretext, or that they were detected as liars, in testifying what they
   had received from God. The second of these I rather prefer, because it
   involves a crime that is much more heinous, and he had spoken
   previously as to men. [36] Now, therefore, he teaches that, if the
   resurrection of Christ is denied, God is made guilty of falsehood in
   the witnesses that have been brought forward and hired by him. [37] The
   reason, too, that is added, corresponds well -- because they had
   declared what was false, not as from themselves, but from God.

   I am at the same time well aware that there are some that give another
   rendering to the particle kata The old interpreter renders it against.
   [38] Erasmus, on the other hand -- concerning. [39] But, as it has also
   among the Greeks the force of apo, (from,) this signification appeared
   to me to be more in accordance with the Apostle's design. For he is not
   speaking here of the reputation of men, (as I have already stated, [40]
   ) but he declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood,
   inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him.

   17. Ye are yet in your sins For although Christ by his death atoned for
   our sins, that they might no more be imputed to us in the judgment of
   God, and has

   crucified our old man, that its lusts might no longer reign in us,
   (Romans 6:6, 12;)

   and, in fine, has

   by death destroyed the power of death, and the devil himself, (Hebrews
   2:14;)

   yet there would have been none of all these things, if he had not, by
   rising again, come off victorious. Hence, if the resurrection is
   overthrown, the dominion of sin is set up anew.

   18. Then they who are fallen asleep. Having it in view to prove, that
   if the resurrection of Christ is taken away, faith is useless, and
   Christianity [41] is a mere deception, he had said that the living
   remain in their sins; but as there is a clearer illustration of this
   matter to be seen in the dead, he adduces them as an example. "Of what
   advantage were it to the dead that they once were Christians? Hence our
   brethren who are now dead, did to no purpose live in the faith of
   Christ." But if it is granted that the essence of the soul is immortal,
   this argument appears, at first sight, conclusive; for it will very
   readily be replied, that the dead have not perished, inasmuch as their
   souls live in a state of separation from their bodies. Hence some
   fanatics conclude that there is no life in the period intermediate
   between death and the resurrection; but this frenzy is easily refuted.
   [42] For although the souls of the dead are now living, and enjoy quiet
   repose, yet the whole of their felicity and consolation depends
   exclusively on the resurrection; because it is well with them on this
   account, and no other, that they wait for that day, on which they shall
   be called to the possession of the kingdom of God. Hence as to the hope
   of the dead, all is over, unless that day shall sooner or later arrive.

   19. But if in this life Here is another absurdity -- that we do not
   merely by believing lose our time and pains, inasmuch as the fruit of
   it perishes at our death, but it were better for us not to believe; for
   the condition of unbelievers were preferable, and more to be desired.
   To believe in this life means here to limit the fruit of our faith to
   this life, so that our faith looks no farther, and does not extend
   beyond the confines of the present life. This statement shows more
   clearly that the Corinthians had been imposed upon by some mistaken
   fancy of a figurative resurrection, such as Hymeneus and Philetus, as
   though the last fruit of our faith were set before us in this life. (2
   Timothy 2:17, 18.) For as the resurrection is the completion of our
   salvation, and as to all blessings is, as it were, the farthest goal,
   [43] the man who says that our resurrection is already past, leaves us
   nothing better to hope for after death. However this may be, this
   passage gives at all events no countenance to the frenzy of those who
   imagine that the soul sleeps as well as the body, until the day of the
   resurrection. [44] They bring forward, it is true, this objection --
   that if the soul continued to live when separated from the body, Paul
   would not have said that, if the resurrection were taken away, we would
   have hope only in this life, inasmuch as there would still be some
   felicity remaining for the soul. To this, however, I reply, that Paul
   did not dream of Elysian fields, [45] and foolish fables of that sort,
   but takes it for granted, that the entire hope of Christians looks
   forward to the final day of judgment -- that pious souls do even at
   this day rest in the same expectation, and that, consequently, we are
   bereft of everything, if a confidence of this nature deceives us.

   But why does he say that we would be the most miserable of all men, as
   if the lot of the Christian were worse than that of the wicked? For all
   things, says Solomon, happen alike to the good and to the bad.
   (Ecclesiastes 9:2.) I answer, that all men, it is true, whether good or
   bad, are liable to distresses in common, and they feel in common the
   same inconveniences, and the same miseries; but there are two reasons
   why Christians have in all ages fared worse, in addition to which,
   there was one that was peculiar to the times of Paul. The first is,
   that while the Lord frequently chastises the wicked, too, with his
   lashes, and begins to inflict his judgments upon them, he at the same
   time peculiarly afflicts his own in various ways; -- in the first
   place, because he chastises those whom he loves, (Hebrews 12:6;) and
   secondly, in order that he may train them to patience, that he may try
   their obedience, and that he may gradually prepare them by the cross
   for a true renovation. However it may be as to this, that statement
   always holds good in the case of believers It is time, that judgment
   should begin at the house of God. (Jeremiah 25:29; 1 Peter 4:17 [46] )
   Again,

   we are reckoned as sheep appointed for slaughter.
   (Psalm 44:22.)

   Again,

   ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
   (Colossians 3:3.)

   Meanwhile, the condition of the wicked is for the most part the more
   desirable, because the Lord feeds them up, as hogs for the day of
   slaughter.

   The second reason is, that believers, even though they should abound in
   riches and in blessings of every kind, they nevertheless do not go to
   excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine, they do not enjoy
   the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety, constantly
   groaning, (2 Corinthians 5:2,) partly from a consciousness of their
   weakness, and partly from an eager longing for the future life.
   Unbelievers, on the other hand, are wholly intent on intoxicating
   themselves with present delights. [47]

   The third reason, which was peculiar, as I have said, to the age of the
   Apostle, is -- that at that time the name of Christians was so odious
   and abominable, that no one could then take upon himself the name of
   Christ without exposing his life to imminent peril. It is, therefore,
   not without good reason that he says that Christians would be the most
   miserable of all men, if their confidence were confined to this world.

   the latter suits his view of Paul's argument." It is justly observed,
   however, by Dr. Alexander, in his translation of Billroth, that Calvin
   may be considered to have "used the word nulla here in the sense of our
   null, void, useless," his assertion being to this effect -- that "if we

   sense -- to the prejudice of -- which falsification would occasion,

   dead, for the Gentile philosophers denied it." -- Ed.

   [42] It is mentioned by Beza in his life of Calvin, that before leaving

   Psychopannychia, against the error of those who, reviving a doctrine
   which had been held in the earliest ages, taught that the soul, when
   separated from the body, falls asleep." -- Calvin's Tracts, volume 1

   [43] This statement as to the resurrection is strikingly in contrast
   with the celebrated sentiment of Horace. (Epist. 1:16, 79.) "Mors est

   Heathen philosophers denied the possibility of a resurrection. Thus
   Pliny, Hist. Nat. L. 2, c. 7, says -- "Revocare defunctos ne Deus qidem
   potest;" -- "To call back the dead is what God himself cannot do."

   [44] Pareus, in commenting on this passage, adverts in the following
   terms to the tenet above referred to -- "Nequaquam vero hinc sequitur,
   quod Psychopannychitae finxerunt: animas post mortem dormire, aut in
   nihilum cum corporibus redigi. Perire enim dicuntur infideles quoad
   animas, non physice, quod corruptae intercant; sed theologice, quod
   viventes felicitatern coelestem non consequantur; sed in tartara ad
   paenas solae vel cum corporibus tandem detrudantur;" -- "By no means,
   however, does it follow from this, according to the contrivance of the
   soul-sleepers, that souls sleep after death, or are reduced to nothing
   along with the body. For unbelievers are said to perish as to their
   souls, not physically, as though they corrupted, and died, but
   theologically, because, while living they do not attain heavenly
   felicity, but are at length thrust down to hell for punishment, alone,
   or along with the body." -- Ed.

   [46] Calvin, in commenting on [6]1 Peter 4:17, when speaking of
   judgment beginning at the house of God, says: "Ideo dicit Paulus, (1
   Corinthians 15:19,) Christianos sublata fide resurrectionis, omnium
   hominum miserrimos fore: et merito, quia dum alii absque metu sibi
   indulgent, assidue ingemiscunt fideles: dum aliorum peccata dissimulat
   Deus, et altos torpore sinit, suos sub cruets disciplina multo rigidins
   exercet;" -- "Hence Paul says, and justly, (1 Corinthians 15:19,) that
   Christians, if the hope of a resurrection were taken away, would be of
   all men the most miserable, because, while others indulge themselves
   without fear, believers incessantly groan: while God seems to let the
   sins of others pass unnoticed, and allows others to be in a torpid
   state, he exercises his own people more strictly under the discipline
   of the cross." -- Ed.

   delights of this world."

   1 Corinthians 15:20-28

   20. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits
   of them that slept.

   20. Nunc autem Christus resurrexit a mortuis, primitiae eorum qui
   domierunt, fuit.

   21. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of
   the dead.

   21. Quandoquidem enim per hominem mors, etiam per hominem resurrectio
   mortuorum.

   22. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

   22. Quemadmodum enim in Adam omnes moriuntur, ita et in Christo omnes
   vivificabuntur.

   23. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward
   they that are Christ's at his coming.

   23. Unusquisque autem in proprio ordine. Primitiae Christus, deinde,
   qui Christi erunt in adventu ipsius.

   24. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to
   God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all
   authority and power.

   24. Postea finis, quum tradiderit regnum Deo et Patri, quum aboleverit
   omnem principatum, et omnem potestatem, et virtutem.

   25. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

   25. Oportet enim ipsum regnare, donec posuerit omnes inimicos sub pedes
   suos.

   26. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

   26. Novissimus destruetur hostis mors.

   27. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all
   things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did
   put all things under him.

   27. Omnia enim subjecit sub pedes eius: quum omnia dixerit, clarum est,
   quod omnia sunt subjecta praeter eum, qui omnia illi subjecit.

   28. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son
   also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that
   God may be all in all.

   28. Quum autem subjecerit illi omnia, tunc et ipse Filius subjicietur
   ei, qui omnia illi subjecit, ut sit Deus omnia in omnibus.


   20. But now hath Christ risen. Having shown what dreadful confusion as
   to everything would follow, if we were to deny that the dead rise
   again, he now again assumes as certain, what he had sufficiently
   established previously -- that Christ has risen; and he adds that he is
   the first-fruits, [48] by a similitude taken, as it appears, from the
   ancient ritual of the law. For as in the first-fruits the produce of
   the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ's resurrection
   is extended to all of us -- unless you prefer to take it in a more
   simple way -- that in him the first fruit of the resurrection was
   gathered. I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this
   sense -- that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire
   harvest does the first-fruits; [49] and this is confirmed by the
   succeeding statement.

   21. Since by man came death The point to be proved is, that Christ is
   the first-fruits, and that it was not merely as an individual that he
   was raised up from the dead. He proves it from contraries, because
   death is not from nature, but from man's sin. As, therefore, Adam did
   not die for himself alone, but for us all, it follows, that Christ in
   like manner, who is the antitype, [50] did not rise for himself alone;
   for he came, that he might restore everything that had been ruined in
   Adam.

   We must observe, however, the force of the argument; for he does not
   contend by similitude, or by example, but has recourse to opposite
   causes for the purpose of proving opposite effects. The cause of death
   is Adam, and we die in him: hence Christ, whose office it is to restore
   to us what we lost in Adam, is the cause of life to us; and his
   resurrection is the ground-work and pledge of ours. And as the former
   was the beginning of death, so the latter is of life. In the fifth
   chapter of the Romans (Romans 5) he follows out the same comparison;
   but there is this difference, that in that passage he reasons
   respecting a spiritual life and death, while he treats here of the
   resurrection of the body, which is the fruit of spiritual life.

   23. Every one in his own order. Here we have an anticipation of a
   question that might be proposed: "If Christ's life," some one might
   say, "draws ours along with it, why does not this appear? Instead of
   this, while Christ has risen from the grave, we lie rotting there."
   Paul's answer is, that God has appointed another order of things. Let
   us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in Christ the
   first-fruits, [51] and that his coming [52] will be the time of our
   resurrection. For our life must still be hid with him, because he has
   not yet appeared. (Colossians 3:3, 4.) It would therefore be
   preposterous to wish to anticipate that day of the revelation of
   Christ.

   24. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered. He put a bridle
   upon the impatience of men, when he forewarned them, that the fit time
   for the new life [53] would not be before Christ's coming. But as this
   world is like a stormy sea, in which we are continually tossed, and our
   condition is so uncertain, or rather is so full of troubles, and there
   are in all things such sudden changes, this might be apt to trouble
   weak minds. Hence he now leads them forward to that day, saying that
   all things will be set in order. Then, therefore, shall come the end --
   that is, the goal of our course -- a quiet harbour -- a condition that
   will no longer be exposed to changes; and he at the same time
   admonishes us, that that end must be waited for, because it is not
   befitting that we should be crowned in the middle of the course. In
   what respect Christ will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, will be
   explained in a little. When he says, God and the Father, this may be
   taken in two senses -- either that God the Father is called the God and
   Father of Christ, or that the name of Father is added by way of
   explanation. The conjunction et (and) will in the latter case mean
   namely. As to the former signification, there is nothing either absurd,
   or unusual, in the saying, that Christ is inferior to God, in respect
   of his human nature.

   When he shall have abolished all rule. Some understand this as
   referring to the powers that are opposed to Christ himself; for they
   have an eye to what immediately follows, until he shall have put all
   his enemies, etc. This clause, however, corresponds with what goes
   before, when he said, that Christ would not sooner deliver up the
   kingdom Hence there is no reason why we should restrict in such a
   manner the statement before us. I explain it, accordingly, in a general
   way, and understand by it -- all powers that are lawful and ordained by
   God. (Romans 13:1.) In the first place, what we find in the Prophets
   (Isaiah 13:10; Ezekiel 32:7) as to the darkening of the sun and moon,
   that God alone may shine forth, while it has begun to be fulfilled
   under the reign of Christ, will, nevertheless, not be fully
   accomplished until the last day; but then every height shall be brought
   low, (Luke 3:5,) that the glory of God may alone shine forth. Farther,
   we know that all earthly principalities and honors are connected
   exclusively with the keeping up of the present life, and, consequently,
   are a part of the world. Hence it follows that they are temporary.

   Hence as the world will have an end, so also will government, and
   magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks, and different orders
   of dignities, and everything of that nature. There will be no more any
   distinction between servant and master, between king and peasant,
   between magistrate and private citizen. Nay more, there will be then an
   end put to angelic principalities in heaven, and to ministries and
   superiorities in the Church, that God may exercise his power and
   dominion by himself alone, and not by the hands of men or angels. The
   angels, it is true, will continue to exist, and they will also retain
   their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine forth, every one
   according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will have to
   resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by the
   commandment of God. Bishops, teachers, and Prophets will cease to hold
   these distinctions, and will resign the office which they now
   discharge. Rule, and authority, and power have much the same meaning in
   this passage; but these three terms are conjoined to bring out the
   meaning more fully.

   25. For he must reign He proves that the time is not yet come when
   Christ will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, with the view of
   showing at the same time that the end has not yet come, when all things
   will be put into a right and tranquil state, because Christ has not yet
   subdued all his enemies. Now that must be brought about, because the
   Father has placed him at his right hand with this understanding, that
   he is not to resign the authority that he has received, until they have
   been subdued under his power. And this is said for the consolation of
   the pious, that they may not be impatient on account of the long delay
   of the resurrection. This statement occurs in Psalm 110:1

   Paul, however, may seem to refine upon the word until beyond what the
   simple and natural meaning of the word requires; for the Spirit does
   not in that passage give intimation of what shall be afterwards, but
   simply of what must be previously. I answer, that Paul does not
   conclude that Christ will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, on the
   ground of its having been so predicted in the Psalm, but he has made
   use of this quotation from the Psalm, for the purpose of proving that
   the day of delivering up the kingdom had not yet arrived, because
   Christ has still to do with his enemies. Paul, however, explains in
   passing what is meant by Christ's sitting at the right hand of the
   Father, when in place of that figurative expression he makes use of the
   simple word reign.

   The last enemy -- death We see that there are still many enemies that
   resist Christ, and obstinately oppose his reign. But death will be the
   last enemy [54] that will be destroyed. Hence Christ must still be the
   administrator of his Father's kingdom. Let believers, therefore, be of
   good courage, and not give up hope, until everything that must precede
   the resurrection be accomplished. It is asked, however, in what sense
   he affirms that death shall be the last enemy [55] that will be
   destroyed, when it has been already destroyed by Christ's death, or at
   least, by his resurrection, which is the victory over death, and the
   attainment of life? I answer, that it was destroyed in such a way as to
   be no longer deadly to believers, but not in such a way as to occasion
   them no uneasiness. The Spirit of God, it is true, dwelling in us is
   life; but we still carry about with us a mortal body. (1 Peter 1:24.)
   The substance of death in us will one day be drained off, but it has
   not been so as yet. We are born again of incorruptible seed, (1 Peter
   1:23,) but we have not yet arrived at perfection. Or to sum up the
   matter briefly in a similitude, the sword of death which could
   penetrate into our very hearts has been blunted. It wounds nevertheless
   still, but without any danger; [56] for we die, but by dying we enter
   into life. In fine, as Paul teaches elsewhere as to sin, (Romans 6:12,)
   such must be our view as to death -- that it dwells indeed in us, but
   it does not reign

   27. He hath put all things under his feet Some think that this
   quotation is taken from Psalm 8:6, and I have no objection to this,
   though there would be nothing out of place in reckoning this statement
   to be an inference that is drawn by Paul from the nature of Christ's
   kingdom. Let us follow, however, the more generally received opinion.
   Paul shows from that Psalm, that God the Father has conferred upon
   Christ the power of all things, because it is said, Thou hast put all
   things under his feet The words are in themselves plain, were it not
   that there are two difficulties that present themselves -- first, that
   the Prophet speaks here not of Christ alone, but of the whole human
   race; and secondly, that by all things he means only those things that
   have to do with the convenience of the life of the body, as we find in
   Genesis 2:19. The solution of the former difficulty is easy; for as
   Christ is the first-born of every creature, (Colossians 1:15,) and the
   heir of all things, (Hebrews 1:2,) God, the Father, has not conferred
   upon the human race the use of all creatures in such a way as to hinder
   that in the mean time the chief power, and, so to speak, the rightful
   dominion, remain in Christ's hands. Farther, we know, that Adam lost
   the right that had been conferred upon him, so that we can no longer
   call anything our own. For the earth was cursed, (Genesis 3:17,) and
   everything that it contains; and it is through Christ alone that we
   recover what has been taken from us. [57] It is with propriety,
   therefore, that this commendation belongs to Christ personally -- that
   the Father has put all things under his feet, inasmuch as we rightfully
   possess nothing except in him. For how shall we become heirs of God, if
   we are not his sons, and by whom are we made his sons but by Christ.

   The solution of the second difficulty is as follows -- that the
   Prophet, it is true, especially mentions fowls of heaven, fishes of the
   sea, and beasts of the field, because this kind of dominion is visible,
   and is more apparent to the eye; but at the same time the general
   statement reaches much farther -- to the heavens and the earth, and
   everything that they contain. Now the subjection must have a
   corrrespondence with the character of him who rules -- that is, it has
   a suitableness to his condition, so as to correspond with it. Now
   Christ does not need animals for food, or other creatures for any
   necessity. He rules, therefore, that all things may be subservient to
   his glory, inasmuch as he adopts us as participants in his dominion.
   The fruit of this openly appears in visible creatures; but believers
   feel in their consciences an inward fruit, which, as I have said,
   extends farther.

   All things put under him, except him who put all things under him. He
   insists upon two things -- first, that all things must be brought under
   subjection to Christ before he restores to the Father the dominion of
   the world, and secondly, that the Father has given all things into the
   hands of his Son in such a way as to retain the principal right in his
   own hands. From the former of these it follows, that the hour of the
   last judgment is not yet come -- from the second, that Christ is now
   the medium between us and the Father in such a way as to bring us at
   length to him. Hence he immediately infers as follows: After he shall
   have subjected all things to him, then shall the Son subject himself to
   the Father. "Let us wait patiently until Christ shall vanquish all his
   enemies, and shall bring us, along with himself, under the dominion of
   God, that the kingdom of God may in every respect be accomplished in
   us."

   This statement, however, is at first view at variance with what we read
   in various passages of Scripture respecting the eternity of Christ's
   kingdom. For how will these things correspond -- Of his kingdom there
   will be no end, (Daniel 7:14, 27; Luke 1:33; 2 Peter 1:11,) and He
   himself shall be subjected? The solution of this question will open up
   Paul's meaning more clearly. In the first place, it must be observed,
   that all power was delivered over to Christ, inasmuch as he was
   manifested in the flesh. It is true that such distinguished majesty
   would not correspond with a mere man, but, notwithstanding, the Father
   has exalted him in the same nature in which he was abased, and has

   given, him a name, before which every knee must bow, etc. (Philippians
   2:9, 10.)

   Farther, it must be observed, that he has been appointed Lord and
   highest King, so as to be as it were the Father's Vicegerent in the
   government of the world -- not that he is employed and the Father
   unemployed (for how could that be, inasmuch as he is the wisdom and
   counsel of the Father, is of one essence with him, and is therefore
   himself God?) But the reason why the Scripture testifies, that Christ
   now holds dominion over the heaven and the earth in the room of the
   Father is -- that we may not think that there is any other governor,
   lord, protector, or judge of the dead and living, but may fix our
   contemplation on him alone. [58] We acknowledge, it is true, God as the
   ruler, but it is in the face of the man Christ. But Christ will then
   restore the kingdom which he has received, that we may cleave wholly to
   God. [59] Nor will he in this way resign the kingdom, but will transfer
   it in a manner from his humanity to his glorious divinity, because a
   way of approach will then be opened up, from which our infirmity now
   keeps us back. Thus then Christ will be subjected to the Father,
   because the vail being then removed, we shall openly behold God
   reigning in his majesty, [60] and Christ's humanity will then no longer
   be interposed to keep us back from a closer view of God. [61]

   28. That God may be all in all Will it be so in the Devil and wicked
   men also? By no means -- unless perhaps we choose to take the verb to
   be as meaning, to be known, and openly beheld. In that case the meaning
   will be: "For the present, as the Devil resists God, as wicked men
   confound and disturb the order which he has established, and as endless
   occasions of offense present themselves to our view, it does not
   distinctly appear that God is all in all; but when Christ will have
   executed the judgment which has been committed to him by the Father,
   and will have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the glory of God will
   be conspicuous in their destruction. The same thing may be said also
   respecting powers that are sacred and lawful in their kind, for they in
   a manner hinder God's being seen aright by us in himself. Then, on the
   other hand, God, holding the government of the heaven and the earth by
   himself, and without any medium, will in that respect be all, and will
   consequently at last be so, not only in all persons, but also in all
   creatures."

   This is a pious interpretation, [62] and, as it corresponds
   sufficiently well with the Apostle's design, I willingly embrace it.
   There would, however, be nothing out of place in understanding it as
   referring exclusively to believers, in whom God has now begun his
   kingdom, and will then perfect it, and in such a way that they shall
   cleave to him wholly. Both meanings sufficiently refute of themselves
   the wicked frenzies of some who bring forward this passage in proof of
   them. Some imagine, that God will be all in all in this respect, that
   all things will vanish and dissolve into nothing. Paul's words,
   however, mean nothing but this, that all things will be brought back to
   God, as their alone beginning and end, that they may be closely bound
   to him. Others infer from this that the Devil and all the wicked will
   be saved -- as if God would not altogether be better known in the
   Devil's destruction, than if he were to associate the Devil with
   himself, and make him one with himself. We see then, how impudently
   madmen of this sort wrest this statement of Paul for maintaining their
   blasphemies.

   [48] "Although the resurrection of Christ, compared with first-fruits
   of any kind, has very good harmony with them, yet it more especially
   agrees with the offering of the sheaf, commonly called vmr, omer, not
   only as the thing itself, but also as to the circumstances of the time.
   For first there was the passover, and the day following was a sabbatic
   day, and on the day following that, the first-fruits were offered. So
   Christ, our passover, was crucified: the day following his crucifixion
   was the Sabbath, and the day following that, he, the first-fruits of
   them that slept, rose again, All who died before Christ, and were
   raised again to life, died afterwards; but Christ is the first-fruits
   of all who shall be raised from the dead to die no more." -- Lightfoot.
   -- Ed.

   [49] "The first-fruits were by the command of God presented to him at a
   stated season, not only as a token of the gratitude of the Israelites
   for his bounty, but as an earnest of the approaching harvest. In this
   sense he is called the first-fruits of the dead. He was the first in
   order of time, for although some were restored to life by the Prophets,
   and by himself during his personal ministry, none came out of their
   graves to return to them no more till after his resurrection; and as he
   was the first in respect of time, so he was the first in order of
   succession; all the saints following him as the harvest followed the
   presentation of the first-fruits of the temple. The interval is long,
   and the dreary sterility of the grave might justify the thought, that
   the seed committed to it has perished for ever. But our hope rests upon
   his power, which can make the wilderness blossom as the rose; and we
   wait till heavenly influences descend as the dew of herbs, when the
   barren soil shall display all the luxuriance of vegetation, and death
   itself shall teem with life." -- Dick's Theology, volume 4 -- Ed.

   our common version, which so vitiates its application that it does not
   seem to sustain the conclusion to which the Apostle had arrived. It was
   his purpose to establish the perfection of our Savior's conquest, the
   advancement of his triumphs, and the prostration of all enemies
   whatever beneath his power. Now to say that the last enemy that shall
   be destroyed is death,' by no means affords a proof of this position.
   Though death might be destroyed, and be the last enemy that shall be
   destroyed, it would not thence appear but that other enemies might
   remain not destroyed. But the proper rendering is, Death, the last
   enemy, should be destroyed.'" -- R. Hall's Works, (Loud. 1846,) volume

   [55] "Ultimum vero seu novissimum hostem cur vocat? Chrysostomus putat,

   or last enemy? Chrysostom thinks, because it came last. The first was
   Satan tempting man to sin. The second -- man's will, voluntarily
   turning aside from God. The third -- sin. Then at length the fourth --
   death, following in the train of sin. There can be no doubt, however,
   that the Apostle calls it the last in respect of duration, in relation
   to the other external enemies of the Church, all of which Christ will
   in the end abolish. Last of all, he will drive away the death of the
   body, by raising up all from death, that this mortal may put on

   accomplished; he will cease to exercise an authority which has no
   longer an object. When all the elect are converted by the truth, and,
   being collected into one body, are presented to the Father a glorious
   Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;' when idolatry,
   superstition, and heresy are overthrown, and all evil is expelled from
   the kingdom of God; when the plans and efforts of wicked spirits are
   defeated, and they are shut up in their prison, from which there is no
   escape; when death has yielded up his spoils, and laid his scepter at
   the feet of his Conqueror; when the grand assize has been held, his
   impartial sentence has pronounced the doom of the human race, and their
   everlasting abodes are allotted to the righteous and the ungodly,
   nothing will remain to be done by the power with which our Savior was
   invested at his ascension; and his work being finished, his commission
   will expire. On this subject we cannot speak with certainty, and are in
   great danger of error, because the event is future, and our information
   is imperfect. Here analogy fails, and the utmost caution is necessary
   in borrowing an illustration from human affairs; but without
   insinuating that the two cases are exactly similar, may we not say,
   that as a regent or vicegerent of a King to whom the royal authority
   has been intrusted for a time, resigns it at the close, and the
   sovereign himself resumes the reins of government; so our Redeemer, who
   now sways the scepter of the universe, will return his delegated power
   to him from whom he received it, and a new order of things will
   commence under which the dependence of men upon the Godhead will be
   immediate; and Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one in essence, counsel,
   and operation, will reign for ever over the inhabitants of heaven. This

   1 Corinthians 15:29-34

   29. Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
   dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

   29. Quid alioqui facient qui baptizantur pro mortuis, si omnino mortui
   non resurgunt? quid etiam baptizantur pro mortuis?

   30. And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

   30. Quid etiam nos periclitamur omni hora?

   31. I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord,
   I die daily.

   31. Quotidie morior per nostram gloriam, fratres, quam habeo in Christo
   Iesu Domino nostro.

   32. If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
   what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for
   to morrow we die.

   32. Si secundum hominem pugnavi ad bestias Ephesi, quid mihi prodest?
   edamus et bibamus: eras enim moriemur.

   33. Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

   33. Ne erretis: Mores honestos corrumpunt mala colloquia.

   34. Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
   knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

   34. Evigilate juste, et ne peccetis: ignorantiam enim Dei quidam
   habent: ad pudorem vobis incutiendum dico.


   29. Else what shall they do He resumes his enumeration of the
   absurdities, which follow from the error under which the Corinthians
   labored. He had set himself in the outset to do this, but he introduced
   instruction and consolation, by means of which he interrupted in some
   degree the thread of his discourse. To this he now returns. In the
   first place he brings forward this objection -- that the baptism which
   those received who are already regarded as dead, will be of no avail if
   there is no resurrection. Before expounding this passage, it is of
   importance to set aside the common exposition, which rests upon the
   authority of the ancients, and is received with almost universal
   consent. Chrysostom, therefore, and Ambrose, who are followed by
   others, are of opinion [63] that the Corinthians were accustomed, when
   any one had been deprived of baptism by sudden death, to substitute
   some living person in the place of the deceased -- to be baptized at
   his grave. They at the same time do not deny that this custom was
   corrupt, and full of superstition, but they say that Paul, for the
   purpose of confuting the Corinthians, was contented with this single
   fact, [64] that while they denied that there was a resurrection, they
   in the mean time declared in this way that they believed in it. For my
   part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this, [65]
   for it is not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a
   resurrection had, along with others, made use of a custom of this sort.
   Paul then would have had immediately this reply made to him: "Why do
   you trouble us with that old wives' superstition, which you do not
   yourself approve of?" Farther, if they had made use of it, they might
   very readily have replied: "If this has been hitherto practiced by us
   through mistake, rather let the mistake be corrected, than that it
   should have weight attached to it for proving a point of such
   importance."

   Granting, however, that the argument was conclusive, can we suppose
   that, if such a corruption as this had prevailed among the Corinthians,
   the Apostle, after reproving almost all their faults, would have been
   silent as to this one? He has censured above some practices that are
   not of so great moment. He has not scrupled to give directions as to
   women's having the head covered, and other things of that nature. Their
   corrupt administration of the Supper he has not merely reproved, but
   has inveighed against it with the greatest keenness. Would he in the
   meantime have uttered not a single word in reference to such a base
   profanation of baptism, which was a much more grievous fault? He has
   inveighed with great vehemence against those who, by frequenting the
   banquets of the Gentiles, silently countenanced their superstitions.
   Would he have suffered this horrible superstition of the Gentiles to be
   openly carried on in the Church itself under the name of sacred
   baptism? But granting that he might have been silent, what shall we say
   when he expressly makes mention of it? Is it, I pray you, a likely
   thing that the Apostle would bring forward in the shape of an argument
   a sacrilege [66] by which baptism was polluted, and converted into a
   mere magical abuse, and yet not say even one word in condemnation of
   the fault? When he is treating of matters that are not of the highest
   importance, he introduces nevertheless this parenthesis, that he speaks
   as a man. (Romans 3:5; Romans 6:19; Galatians 3:15.) Would not this
   have been a more befitting and suitable place for such a parenthesis?
   Now from his making mention of such a thing without any word of
   reproof, who would not understand it to be a thing that was allowed?
   For my part, I assuredly understand him to speak here of the right use
   of baptism, and not of an abuse of it of that nature.

   Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one time I was of opinion,
   that Paul here pointed out the universal design of baptism, for the
   advantage of baptism is not confined to this life; but on considering
   the words afterwards with greater care, I perceived that Paul here
   points out something peculiar. For he does not speak of all when he
   says, What shall they do, who are baptized? etc. Besides, I am not fond
   of interpretations, that are more ingenious than solid. What then? I
   say, that those are baptized for dead, who are looked upon as already
   dead, and who have altogether despaired of life; and in this way the
   particle huper will have the force of the Latin pro, as when we say,
   habere pro derelicto; -- to reckon as abandoned [67] This signification
   is not a forced one. Or if you would prefer another signification, to
   be baptized for the dead will mean -- to be baptized so as to profit
   the dead -- not the living, [68] Now it is well known, that from the
   very commencement of the Church, those who had, while yet catechumens,
   [69] fallen into disease, [70] if their life was manifestly in danger,
   were accustomed to ask baptism, that they might not leave this world
   before they had made a profession of Christianity; and this, in order
   that they might carry with them the seal of their salvation.

   It appears from the writings of the Fathers, that as to this matter,
   also, there crept in afterwards a superstition, for they inveigh
   against those who delayed baptism till the time of their death, that,
   being once for all purged from all their sins, they might in this state
   meet the judgment of God. [71] A gross error truly, which proceeded
   partly from great ignorance, and partly from hypocrisy! Paul, however,
   here simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with
   the Divine institution -- that if a catechumen, who had already in his
   heart embraced the Christian faith, [72] saw that death was impending
   over him, he asked baptism, partly for his own consolation, and partly
   with a view to the edification of his brethren. For it is no small
   consolation to carry the token of his salvation sealed in his body.
   There is also an edification, not to be lost sight of -- that of making
   a confession of his faith. They were, then, baptized for the dead,
   inasmuch as it could not be of any service to them in this world, and
   the very occasion of their asking baptism was that they despaired of
   life. We now see that it is not without good reason that Paul asks,
   what they would do if there remained no hope after death? [73] This
   passage shows us, too, that those impostors who had disturbed the faith
   of the Corinthians, had contrived a figurative resurrection, making the
   farthest goal of believers to be in this world, His repeating it a
   second time, Why are they also baptized for the dead? gives it greater
   emphasis: "Not only are those baptized who think that they are to live
   longer, but those too who have death before their eyes; and that, in
   order that they may in death reap the fruit of their baptism."

   30. Why are we also? "If our resurrection and ultimate felicity are in
   this world, why do we of our own accord abandon it, and voluntarily
   encounter death?" The argument might also be unfolded in this manner:
   "To no purpose would we stand in peril every hour, if we did not look
   for a better life, after death has been passed through." He speaks,
   however, of voluntary dangers, to which believers expose their lives
   for the purpose of confessing Christ. "This magnanimity of soul, I say,
   in despising death, would be ascribed to rashness rather than firmness,
   if the saints perished at death, for it is a diabolical madness to
   purchase by death an immortal fame.^" [74]

   31. I die daily Such a contempt of death he declares to be in himself,
   that he may not seem to talk bravely when beyond the reach of danger.
   "I am every day," says he, "incessantly beset with death. What madness
   were it in me to undergo so much misery, if there were no reward in
   reserve for me in heaven? Nay more, if my glory and bliss lie in this
   world, why do I not rather enjoy them, than of my own accord resign
   them?" He says that he dies daily, because he was constantly beset with
   dangers so formidable and so imminent, that death in a manner was
   impending over him. A similar expression occurs in Psalm 44:22, and we
   shall, also, find one of the same kind occurring in the second Epistle.
   (2 Corinthians 11:23.)

   By our glory. The old translation reads propter, (because of,) [75] but
   it has manifestly arisen from the ignorance of transcribers; for in the
   Greek particle [76] there is no ambiguity. It is then an oath, by which
   he wished to arouse the Corinthians, to be more attentive in listening
   to him, when reasoning as to the matter in hand. [77] "Brethren, I am
   not some philosopher prattling in the shade. [78] As I expose myself
   every day to death, it is necessary that I should think in good earnest
   of the heavenly life. Believe, therefore, a man who is thoroughly
   experienced."

   It is also a form of oath that is not common, but is suited to the
   subject in hand. Corresponding to this was that celebrated oath of
   Demosthenes, which is quoted by Fabius, [79] when he swore by the
   Shades of those who had met death in the field of Marathon, while his
   object was to exhort them to defend the Republic. [80] So in like
   manner Paul here swears by the glory which Christians have in Christ.
   Now that glory is in heaven. He shows, then, that what they called in
   question was a matter of which he was so well assured, that he was
   prepared to make use of a sacred oath -- a display of skill which must
   be carefully noticed.

   32. If according to the manner of men He brings forward a notable
   instance of death, from which it might be clearly seen that he would
   have been worse than a fool, if there were not a better life in reserve
   for us beyond death; for it was an ignominious kind of death to which
   he was exposed. "To what purpose were it," says he, "for me to incur
   infamy in connection with a most cruel death, if all my hopes were
   confined to this world?" According to the manner of men, means in this
   passage, in respect of human life, so that we obtain a reward in this
   world.

   Now by those that fought with beasts, are meant, not those that were
   thrown to wild beasts, as Erasmus mistakingly imagined, but those that
   were condemned to be set to fight with wild beasts -- to furnish an
   amusement to the people. There were, then, two kinds of punishment,
   that were totally different -- to be thrown to wild beasts, and to
   fight with wild beasts. For those that were thrown to wild beasts were
   straightway torn in pieces; but those that fought with wild beasts went
   forth armed into the arena, that if they were endued with strength,
   courage, and agility, they might effect their escape by dispatching the
   wild beasts. Nay more, there was a game in which those who fought with
   wild beasts were trained, like the gladiators [81] Usually, however,
   very few escaped, because the man who had dispatched one wild beast,
   was required to fight with a second, [82] until the cruelty of the
   spectators was satiated, or rather was melted into pity; and yet there
   were found men so abandoned and desperate, as to hire themselves out
   for this! [83] And this, I may remark by the way, is that kind of
   hunting that is punished so severely by the ancient canons, as even
   civil laws brand it with a mark of infamy. [84]

   I return to Paul. [85] We see what an extremity God allowed his servant
   to come to, and how wonderfully, too, he rescued him. Luke, [86]
   however, makes no mention of this fight. Hence we may infer that he
   endured many things that have not been committed to writing.

   Let us eat and drink This is a saying of the Epicureans, who reckon
   man's highest good as consisting in present enjoyment. Isaiah also
   testifies that it is a saying made use of by profligate persons,
   (Isaiah 22:13,) who, when the Prophets of God threaten them with ruin,
   [87] with the view of calling them to repentance, making sport of those
   threatenings, encourage themselves in wantonness and unbridled mirth,
   and in order to show more openly their obstinacy, say, "Since die we
   must, let us meanwhile enjoy the time, and not torment ourselves before
   the time with empty fears." As to what a certain General said to his
   army, [88] "My fellowsoldiers, let us dine heartily, for we shall sup
   to-day in the regions below," [89] that was an exhortation to meet
   death with intrepidity, and has nothing to do with this subject. I am
   of opinion, that Paul made use of a jest in common use among abandoned
   and desperately wicked persons, or (to express it shortly) a common
   proverb among the Epicureans to the following purpose: "If death is the
   end of man, there is nothing better than that he should indulge in
   pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts." Sentiments of this
   kind are to be met with frequently in Horace. [90]

   33. Be not deceived. Evil communications corrupt good manners As
   nothing is easier than to glide into profane speculation, under the
   pretext of inquiring, [91] he meets this danger, by warning them that
   evil communications have more effect than we might suppose, in
   polluting our minds and corrupting our morals. [92] To show this, he
   makes use of a quotation from the poet Menander, [93] as we are at
   liberty to borrow from every quarter everything that has come forth
   from God. And as all truth is from God, there is no doubt that the Lord
   has put into the mouth of the wicked themselves, whatever contains true
   and salutary doctrine. I prefer, however, that, for the handling of
   this subject, recourse should be had to Basil's Oration to the Young.
   Paul, then, being aware that this proverb was in common use among the
   Greeks, chose rather to make use of it, that it might make its way into
   their minds more readily, than to express the same thing in his own
   words. For they would more readily receive what they had been
   accustomed to -- as we have experience of in proverbs with which we are
   familiar.

   Now it is a sentiment that is particularly worthy of attention, for
   Satan, when he cannot make a direct assault upon us, [94] deludes us
   under this pretext, that there is nothing wrong in our raising any kind
   of disputation with a view to the investigation of truth. Here,
   therefore, Paul in opposition to this, warns us that we must guard
   against evil communications, as we would against the most deadly
   poison, because, insinuating themselves secretly into our minds, they
   straightway corrupt our whole life. Let us, then, take notice, that
   nothing is more pestilential than corrupt doctrine and profane
   disputations, which draw us off, even in the smallest degree, from a
   right and simple faith; [95] for it is not without good reason that
   Paul exhorts us not to be deceived. [96]

   34. Awake righteously As he saw that the Corinthians were in a manner
   intoxicated, [97] through excessive carelessness, he arouses them from
   their torpor. By adding, however, the adverb righteously, he intimates
   in what way he would have them wake up For they were sufficiently
   attentive and clear-sighted as to their own affairs: nay more, there
   can be no doubt that they congratulated themselves on their acuteness;
   but in the mean time they were drowsy, where they ought most of all to
   have been on the watch. He says accordingly, awake righteously -- that
   is, "Direct your mind and aim to things that are good and holy."

   He adds at the same time the reason, -- For some, says he, among you
   are in ignorance of God This required to be stated: otherwise they
   might have thought that the admonition was unnecessary; for they looked
   upon themselves as marvellously wise. Now he convicts them of ignorance
   of God, that they may know that the main thing was wanting in them. A
   useful admonition to those who lay out all their agility in flying
   through the air, while in the mean time they do not see what is before
   their feet, and are stupid where they ought, most of all, to have been
   clear-sighted.

   To your shame Just as fathers, when reproving their children for their
   faults, put them to shame, in order that they may by that shame cover
   their shame. When, however, he declared previously that he did not wish
   to shame them, (1 Corinthians 4:14,) his meaning was that he did not
   wish to hold them up to disgrace, by bringing forward their faults to
   public view in a spirit of enmity and hatred. [98] In the mean time,
   however, it was of advantage for them to be sharply reproved, as they
   were still indulging themselves in evils of such magnitude. Now Paul in
   reproaching them with ignorance of God, strips them entirely of all
   honor.

   [71] Cornelius a Lapide, in his Commentary on the Canonical Epistles,

   by Calvin^: "Inter conversos olim multi erant qui Baptismum diu
   differebant, etiam usque ad mortem, adeoque aegri in lecto
   baptizabantur, ut per Baptismum expiati ab omni culpa et poena illico
   puri evolarent in coelum:" -- "Among the converted there were anciently
   many who deferred baptism for a long time, even up to the time of their
   death, and were accordingly baptized when sick in bed, that cleared by
   baptism from all fault and punishment, they might fly up to heaven
   pure." Milner, in his Church History, (volume 2,) when treating of
   Gregory Nazianzen, says, "In another discourse, he protests against the
   too common practice of delaying baptism, which, from the example of
   Constantine, had grown very fashionable, for reasons equally corrupt
   and superstitious. Men lived in sin as long as they thought they could
   safely, and deferred baptism till their near approach to death, under a
   groundless hope of washing away all their guilt at once." See also
   Turretine's Theology, (Geneva, 1690,) volume 3 -- Ed.

   [72] "Si celuy qui n' estoit pas encore parfaitement instruit en la

   affection."

   [73] "Baptism," says Dr. Dick, in his Lectures on Theology, (volume 4)
   "imports our interest in the resurrection of Christ and its
   consequences. It was called by the ancients the earnest of good things
   to come,' and the type of the future resurrection.' May not this be the
   meaning of that passage in the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle
   to the Corinthians, concerning which there has been such a diversity of
   opinion? Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
   the dead rise not? why are they then baptized for the dead?' (1
   Corinthians 15:29.) Some of the Fathers understood the expression,
   huper ton nekron, to mean to be baptized into the hope of the
   resurrection of the dead; or, what amounts to the same thing, to submit
   to baptism that they might fill up the places of those who had died,
   thus declaring their belief that they had not perished, but were alive
   in a better world, and their hope that, through Jesus Christ, to whom
   they dedicated themselves in baptism, they also should be raised again
   to enjoy the same glorious recompense. According to this view of the
   passage, a resurrection to life is one of the blessings signified and
   sealed by this institution. It assures us of a triumph over death and
   the grave, through the redeeming blood of Christ, with which we are
   sprinkled; and of admission into heaven, for which we are qualified by
   the washing of regeneration." -- Ed.

   [96] "The connection is not that in which we should have expected such
   a maxim to be inserted. It is in the midst of a very affecting and
   instructive view of the resurrection of the dead and the life
   everlasting; but the occasion of it was this: the Corinthians had
   received, from the intrusion of false teachers, principles which
   militated against that great doctrine. They had been taught to explain
   it away, and to resolve it merely into a moral process which takes
   place in the present world; interpreting what is said of the
   resurrection of the dead in a mystical and figurative manner. The
   apostle insinuates, that it was by a mixture of the corrupt
   communications of these men with the Christian Church, and the intimate
   contact into which they had permitted themselves to come with them,
   that they had been led off from the fundamental doctrine of the gospel,
   and rejected a primary part of the apostolic testimony. For if there be
   no resurrection of the dead, then,' as he observed, is Christ not
   risen, and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
   faith is also vain; ye are yet in your sins.' We see, that
   notwithstanding the apostle had planted pure Christianity among the
   Corinthians, and had confirmed it by the most extraordinary miracles
   and supernatural operations, yet such was the contagion of evil example
   and corrupt communication, that the members of the Corinthian Church,
   in a very short time, departed from the fundamental article of the
   truth as it is in Jesus Christ; and hence we may learn the importance,
   nay, the necessity, of being on our guard in this respect, and of
   avoiding such confidence in ourselves as might induce us to neglect the
   caution here so forcibly expressed -- 'Be not deceived; evil
   communications corrupt good manners.'" -- R. Hall's Works, (Lond.
   1846,) volume 6, pages 273, 274. -- Ed.

   [97] The original word eknepsate, properly signifies to awake sober out
   of a drunken sleepage It is used in this sense in stone instances in
   the Septuagint. Thus in Joel 1:5, Eknepsate hoi methuntes Awake, ye
   drunkards. See also Genesis 9:24, and 1 Samuel 25:37. It is used in the
   same sense by classical writers. "Awake to righteousness and sin not,
   for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame;'
   that is, shake off the mental delusion and stupor in which the
   intoxication of error has involved you, that, with clear and exerted
   faculties, you may attend to the most important subject." -- Brown's
   Expository Discourses on Peter, volume in. page 8. The expression
   eknepsate dikaios, (awake righteously,) is rendered by Luther machet
   recht aui -- "Wake right up." It is, however, generally considered to
   be elliptical. Some supply zesotes -- "Awake, that ye may live
   righteously. Others understand dikaios, as equivalent to hos dikaios
   dei "as it is fit you should." "Arrian and Menander," says Parkhurst,
   "use dikaios in this sense, as may be seen in Alberti on the text." To
   the two authorities quoted by Alberti, Alexander in his Paraphrase on 1
   Corinthians xv., adds one from Ocellus Lucanus -- O de diamachomenos
   dikaios, but the man who stands up for his own authority as he ought to
   do." -- Apud Gale, page 533, I. 20. Ed. 1688. -- Ed.

   1 Corinthians 15:35-50

   35. But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
   body do they come?

   35. Sed dicet quispiam: Quomodo suscitabuntur mortui? quali nutem
   corpore venient?

   36. Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:

   36. Demens, tu quod seminas, non vivificatur nisi mortuum fuerit.

   37. And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall
   be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:

   37. Et quod seminas, non corpus quod nascentur, seminas, sed nudum
   granum: exempli gratis, tritici, nut alterius cujusvis generis:

   38. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed
   his own body.

   38. Deus autem illi dat corpus, quemadmodum voluerit, et unicuique
   seminum proprium corpus.

   39. All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of
   men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

   39. Non omnis caro, eadem caro: sed alia caro hominum, alia vero cato
   pecudum, alia volucrum, alia piscium.

   40. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
   glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is
   another.

   40. Sunt et corpora coelestia, sunt corpora terrestria: quin etiam alia
   coelestium gloria, alia terrestrium.

   41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
   another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in
   glory.

   41. Alia gloria solis, alia gloria lunae, alia gloria stellarum: stella
   a stella differt in gloria:

   42. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption;
   it is raised in incorruption:

   42. Sic et resurrectio mortuorum. Seminatur in corruptione, re surgit
   in incorruptione: [99]

   43. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is sown in
   weakness; it is raised in power:

   43. Seminatur in ignominia, resurgit in gloria: seminatur in
   infirmitate, resurgit in potentia:

   44. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is
   a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

   44. Seminatur corpus animale, resurgit corpus spirituale: est corpus
   animale, est et corpus spirituale.

   45. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;
   the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

   45. Quemadmodum et scriptum eat, (Gen 2:7,) Factus est primus homo Adam
   in animam viventem, ultimus Adam in spiritum vivificantem.

   46. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
   natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

   46. Sed non primum quod spirituale est: sed animale, deinde spirituale.

   47. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord
   from heaven.

   47. Primus homo ex terra terrenus, secundus homo, Dominus e coelo.

   48. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the
   heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

   48. Qualis terrenus, tales et terreni, et qualis coelestis, tales et
   coelestes.

   49. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
   the image of the heavenly.

   49. Et quemadmodum portavimus imaginem terreni, portabimus et imaginem
   coelestis.

   50. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
   kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

   50. Hoc autem dico, fratres, quod cato et sanguis regnum Dei hereditate
   possidere non possunt, neque corruptio incorruptionem hereditate
   possidebit.


   35. How will they be raised up? There is nothing that is more at
   variance with human reason than this article of faith. For who but God
   alone could persuade us that bodies, which are now liable to
   corruption, will, after having rotted away, or after they have been
   consumed by fire, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, will not merely be
   restored entire, but in a greatly better condition. Do not all our
   apprehensions of things straightway reject this as a thing fabulous,
   nay, most absurd? [100] Paul, with the view of removing entirely this
   appearance of absurdity, makes use of an anhypophora, [101] that is, he
   brings forward by way of objection, in the person of another, what
   appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a
   resurrection. For this question is not that of one who inquires
   doubtingly as to the mode, but of one who argues from impossibility --
   that is, what is said as to the resurrection is a thing incredible.
   Hence in his reply he repels such an objection with severity. Let us
   observe, then, that the persons who are here introduced as speaking,
   are those who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in
   the resurrection, on the ground of its being a thing that is
   impossible.

   36. Thou fool, that which thou sowest The Apostle might have replied,
   that the mode, which is to us incomprehensible, is nevertheless easy
   with God. Hence, we must not here form our judgment according to our
   own understanding, but must assign to the stupendous and secret power
   of God the honor of believing, that it will accomplish what we cannot
   comprehend. He goes to work, however, in another way. For he shows,
   that the resurrection is so far from being against nature, that we have
   every day a clear illustration of it in the course of nature itself --
   in the growth of the fruits of the earth. For from what but from
   rottenness spring the fruits that we gather out of the earth? For when
   the seed has been sown, unless the grains die, there will be no
   increase. Corruption, then, being the commencement and cause of
   production, we have in this a sort of picture of the resurrection.
   Hence it follows, that we are beyond measure spiteful and ungrateful in
   estimating the power of God, if we take from him what is already
   manifest before our eyes.

   37. Thou sowest not that body that will spring up. This comparison
   consists of two parts -- first, that it is not to be wondered that
   bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the same thing takes place as
   to seed; and secondly, that it is not at variance with reason, that our
   bodies should be restored in another condition, since, from bare grain,
   God brings forth so many ears of corn, clothed with admirable
   contrivance, and stored with grains of superior quality. As, however,
   he might seem to intimate, by speaking in this way, that many bodies
   will therefore rise out of one, he modifies his discourse in another
   way, by saying that God forms the body as it pleases him, meaning that
   in that also there is a difference in respect of quality.

   He adds, to every seed its own body By this clause he restricts what he
   had said respecting another body; for he says that, while the body is
   different, it is in such a way as to retain, nevertheless, its
   particular kind.

   39. All flesh is not, etc. Here we have another comparison leading to
   the same conclusion, though there are some that explain it otherwise.
   For when he says, that under the name of flesh is comprehended the body
   of a man as well as of a beast, and yet the flesh in those two cases is
   different, he means by this that the substance indeed is the same, but
   there is a difference as to quality. The sum is this -- that whatever
   diversity we see in any particular kind is a sort of prelude of the
   resurrection, because God clearly shows, that it is no difficult thing
   with him to renew our bodies by changing the present condition of
   things. [102]

   41. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon Not
   only is there a difference between heavenly bodies and earthly, but
   even the heavenly bodies have not all the same glory; for the sun
   surpasses the moon, and the other stars differ from each other. This
   dissimilarity, accordingly, appears [103] in the resurrection of the
   dead. A mistake, however, is commonly fallen into in the application;
   [104] for it is supposed that Paul meant to say, that, after the
   resurrection, the saints will have different degrees of honor and
   glory. This, indeed, is perfectly true, and is proved by other
   declarations of Scripture; but it has nothing to do with Paul's object.
   For he is not arguing as to what difference of condition there will be
   among the saints after the resurrection, but in what respect our bodies
   at present differ from those that we will one day receive. [105]

   He removes, then, every idea of absurdity, by instituting this
   comparison: The substance of the sun and moon is the same, but there is
   a great difference between them in point of dignity and excellence. Is
   it to be wondered, then, if our body puts on a more excellent quality?
   [106] "I do not teach that anything will take place at the resurrection
   but what is already presented before the eyes of all." That such is the
   meaning of the words is clear from the context. For whence and for what
   purpose would Paul make such a transition, were he now comparing them
   with one another in respect of the difference of their condition, while
   up to this point he has been comparing the present condition of all
   with their future condition, and immediately proceeds with that
   comparison?

   43. It is sown in corruption That there may be no doubt remaining, Paul
   explains himself, by unfolding the difference between their present
   condition, and that which will be after the resurrection. What
   connection, then, would there be in his discourse, if he had intended
   in the first instance [107] to distinguish between the different
   degrees of future glory among the saints? There can, therefore, be no
   doubt, that he has been, up to this point, following out one subject.
   He now returns to the first similitude that he had made use of, but
   applies it more closely to his design. Or, if you prefer it, keeping up
   that similitude, he figuratively compares the time of the present life
   to the seed-time, and the resurrection to the harvest; and he says,
   that our body is now, indeed, subject to mortality and ignominy, but
   will then be glorious and incorruptible. He says the same thing in
   other words in Philippians 3:21

   Christ will change our vile body,
   that he may make it like to his own glorious body.

   44. It is sown an animal body. As he could not express each particular
   by enumerating one by one, he sums up all comprehensively in one word,
   by saying that the body is now animal, [108] but it will then be
   spiritual. Now that is called animal which is quickened by (anima) the
   soul: that is spiritual which is quickened by the Spirit. [109] Now it
   is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead
   carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it. After the
   resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it
   will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent. [110] Let us,
   however, always bear in mind, what we have seen previously -- that the
   substance of the body is the same, [111] and that it is the quality
   only that is here treated of. Let the present quality of the body be
   called, for the sake of greater plainness, animation; [112] let the
   future receive the name of inspiration. For as to the soul's now
   quickening the body, that is effected through the intervention of many
   helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other
   things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of animation is clearly
   manifested. The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for
   quickening, will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted
   from necessities of that nature. This is the simple and genuine meaning
   of the Apostle; that no one may, by philosophizing farther, indulge in
   airy speculations, as those do, who suppose that the substance of the
   body will be spiritual, while there is no mention made here of
   substance, and no change will be made upon it.

   45. As it is written, The first Adam was made Lest it should seem to be
   some new contrivance as to the animal body, [113] he quotes Scripture,
   which declares that Adam became a living soul, (Genesis 2:7) --
   meaning, that his body was quickened by the soul, so that he became a
   living man. It is asked, what is the meaning of the word soul here? It
   is well known, that the Hebrew word nphs, (nephesh,) which Moses makes
   use of, is taken in a variety of senses; but in this passage it is
   taken to mean either vital motion, or the very essence of life itself.
   The second of these I rather prefer. I observe that the same thing is
   affirmed as to beasts -- that they were made a living soul, (Genesis
   1:20, 24;) but as the soul of every animal must be judged of according
   to its kind, there is nothing to hinder that a soul, that is to say,
   vital motion, may be common to all; and yet at the same time the soul
   of man may have something peculiar and distinguishing, namely, immortal
   essence, as the light of intelligence and reason.

   The last Adam. This expression we do not find anywhere written. [114]
   Hence the phrase, It is written, must be understood as referring
   exclusively to the first clause; but after bringing forward this
   testimony of Scripture, the Apostle now begins in his own person to
   draw a contrast between Christ and Adam. "Moses relates that Adam was
   furnished with a living soul; Christ, on the other hand, is endowed
   with a life-giving Spirit. Now it is a much greater thing to be life,
   or the source of life, than simply to live." [115] It must be observed,
   however, that Christ did also, like us, become a living soul; but,
   besides the soul, the Spirit of the Lord was also poured-out upon him,
   that by his power he might rise again from the dead, and raise up
   others, This, therefore, must be observed, in order that no one may
   imagine, (as Apollinaris [116] did of old,) that the Spirit was in
   Christ in place of a soul. And independently of this, the
   interpretation of this passage may be taken from the eighth chapter of
   the Romans, where the Apostle declares, that the body, indeed, is dead,
   on account of sin, and we carry in us the elements of death; but that
   the Spirit of Christ, who raised him up from the dead, dwelleth also in
   us, and that he is life, to raise up us also one day from the dead.
   (Romans 8:10, 11.) From this you see, that we have living souls,
   inasmuch as we are men, but that we have the life-giving Spirit of
   Christ poured out upon us by the grace of regeneration. In short,
   Paul's meaning is, that the condition that we obtain through Christ is
   greatly superior to the lot of the first man, because a living soul was
   conferred upon Adam in his own name, and in that of his posterity, but
   Christ has procured for us the Spirit, who is life.

   Now as to his calling Christ the last Adam, the reason is this, that as
   the human race was created in the first man, so it is renewed in
   Christ. I shall express it again, and more distinctly: All men were
   created in the first man, because, whatever God designed to give to
   all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the condition of mankind
   was settled in his person. He by his fall [117] ruined himself and
   those that were his, because he drew them all, along with himself, into
   the same ruin: Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise
   it up to a better condition than ever. They [118] are then, as it were,
   two sources, or two roots of the human race. Hence it is not without
   good reason, that the one is called the first man, and the other the
   last. This, however, gives no support to those madmen, who make Christ
   to be one of ourselves, as though there were and always had been only
   two men, and that this multitude which we behold, were a mere phantom!
   A similar comparison occurs in Romans 5:12

   46. But this is not first, which is spiritual. "It is necessary," says
   he, "that before we are restored in Christ, we derive our origin from
   Adam, and resemble him. Let us, therefore, not wonder, if we begin with
   the living soul, for as being born precedes in order being born again,
   so living precedes rising again."

   47. The first Adam was from the earth. The animal life comes first,
   because the earthy man is first. [119] The spiritual life will come
   afterwards, as Christ, the heavenly man, came after Adam. Now the
   Manichees perverted this passage, with the view of proving that Christ
   brought a body from heaven into the womb of the Virgin. They
   mistakingly imagined, however, that Paul speaks here of the substance
   of the body, while he is discoursing rather as to its condition, or
   quality. Hence, although the first man had an immortal soul, and that
   too, not taken from the earth, yet he, nevertheless, savoured of the
   earth, from which his body had sprung, and on which he had been
   appointed to live. Christ, on the other hand, brought us from heaven a
   life-giving Spirit, that he might regenerate us into a better life, and
   elevated above the earth. [120] In fine, we have it from Adam -- that
   we live in this world, as branches from the root: Christ, on the other
   hand, is the beginning and author of the heavenly life.

   But some one will say in reply, Adam is said to be from the earth --
   Christ from heaven; the nature of the comparison [121] requires this
   much, that Christ have his body from heaven, as the body of Adam was
   formed from the earth; or, at least, that the origin of man's soul
   should be from the earth, but that Christ's soul had come forth from
   heaven. I answer, that Paul had not contrasted the two departments of
   the subject with such refinement and minuteness, (for this was not
   necessary;) but when treating of the nature of Christ and Adam, he made
   a passing allusion to the creation of Adam, that he had been formed
   from the earth,, and at the same time, for the purpose of commending
   Christ's excellence, he states, that he is the Son of God, who came
   down to us from heaven, and brings with him, therefore, a heavenly
   nature and influence. This is the simple meaning, while the refinement
   of the Manichees is a mere calumny.

   We must, however, reply to another objection still. For Christ, so long
   as he lived in the world, lived a life similar to ours, and therefore
   earthly: hence it is not a proper contrast. The solution of this
   question will serve farther to refute the contrivance [122] of the
   Manichees. For we know, that the body of Christ was liable to death,
   and that it was exempted from corruption, not by its essential
   property, (as they speak,) [123] but solely by the providence of God.
   Hence Christ was not merely earthy as to the essence of his body, but
   was also for a time in an earthly condition; for before Christ's power
   could show itself in conferring the heavenly life, it was necessary
   that he should die in the weakness of the flesh, (2 Corinthians 13:4.)
   Now this heavenly life appeared first in the resurrection, that he
   might quicken us also.

   49. As we have borne Some have thought, that there is here an
   exhortation to a pious and holy life, into which Paul was led by way of
   digression; and on that account they have changed the verb from the
   future tense into the hortative mood. Nay more, in some Greek
   manuscripts the reading is phoresomen (let us bear,) [124] but as that
   does not suit so well in respect of connection, let us adopt in
   preference what corresponds better with the object in view and the
   context. [125] Let us observe, in the first place, that this is not an
   exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not treating here of
   newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption, the thread of
   his discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh. The meaning
   accordingly will be this: "As the animal nature, which has the
   precedency in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed to
   Christ in the heavenly nature; and this will be the completion of our
   restoration. For we now begin to bear the image of Christ, and are
   every day more and more transformed into it; [126] but that image
   consists in spiritual regeneration. But then it will be fully restored
   both in body and in soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and
   accordingly we will obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for."
   If, however, any one prefers a different reading, this statement will
   serve to spur forward the Corinthians; and if there had been a lively
   meditation of sincere piety and a new life, it might have been the
   means of kindling up in them at the same time the hope of heavenly
   glory.

   50. Now this I say This clause intimates, that what follows is
   explanatory of the foregoing statement. "What I have said as to bearing
   the image of the heavenly Adam means this -- that we must be renewed in
   respect of our bodies, inasmuch as our bodies, being liable to
   corruption, cannot inherit God's incorruptible kingdom. Hence there
   will be no admission for us into the kingdom of Christ, otherwise than
   by Christ's renewing us after his own image." Flesh and blood, however,
   we must understand, according to the condition in which they at present
   are, for our flesh will be a participant in the glory of God, but it
   will be -- as renewed and quickened by the Spirit of Christ.

   [102] "Nearly allied to these are the examples of peculiar
   transformations undergone by various insects, and the state of rest and
   insensibility which precede those transformations; such as the
   chrysalis or aurelia state of butterflies, moths, and silkworms. The
   myrmeleon forniicaleo, of whose larva, and its extraordinary history,
   Reaumur and Roesel have given accurate descriptions, continues in its
   insensible or chrysalis state about four weeks. The libellula, or
   dragon-fly, continues still longer in its state of inaction.
   Naturalists tell us that the worm repairs to the margin of its pond, in
   quest of a convenient place of abode, during its insensible state. It
   attaches itself to a plant, or piece of dry wood, and the skin, which
   gradually becomes parched and brittle, at last splits opposite to the
   upper part of the thorax: through this aperture the insect, now become
   winged, quickly pushes its way, and being thus extricated front
   confinement, begins to expand its wings, to flutter, and, finally, to
   launch into the air with that gracefulness and ease which are peculiar
   to this majestic tribe. Now who that saw, for the first time, the
   little pendant coffin in which the insect lay entombed, and was
   ignorant of the transformation of which we are now speaking, would ever
   predict that, in a few weeks, perhaps in a few days or hours, it would
   become one of the most elegant and active of winged insects? And who
   that contemplates, with the mind of a philosopher, this current
   transformation, and knows that two years before the insect mounts into
   the air, even while it is living in water, it has the rudiments of
   wings, can deny that the body of a dead man may, at some future period,

   living soul: he is all soul, and that soul all life.' But now is this
   living soul buried in flesh, a lost thing to all the true, and great,
   and noble ends and purposes of that life which was at first given it.
   It is true, indeed, that this is a thing much less than what is said of
   the second Adam, in 1 Corinthians 15:45. The first man Adam was made a
   living soul; the second Adam was a quickening Spirit.' This latter is a
   great deal more. A living soul signified him to live himself; but a
   quickening spirit signifies a power to make others live. That the first
   Adam could not do; the more excellent kind of life which he had (for
   there was a complication of lives in the first creation of this man) he
   could not lose: but he could not give. He could not lose it from
   himself; but he could never have given it, by any power or immediate
   efficiency of his own, to another. Here the second Adam -- the
   constitution of the second Adam -- was far above that of the first, in
   that he could quicken others -- a quickening spirit, not only quickened
   passively, but quickened actively, such a spirit as could give spirit,

   1 Corinthians 15:51-58

   51. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall
   all be changed,

   51. Ecce, mysterium vobis dico: Non omnes quidem dormiemus, omnes tamen
   immutabimur,

   52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
   trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
   shall be changed.

   52. In puncto temporis, in nictu oculi, cum extrema tuba, (canet enim
   tuba,) et mortui resurgent incorruptibiles, et nos immutabimur.

   53. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
   put on immortality.

   53. Oportet enim corruptibile hoc induere immortalitatem.

   54. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
   mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
   saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

   54. Quum autem corruptibile hoc induerit incorruptibilitatem, et
   mortale hoc induerit immortalitatem: tunc flet sermo qui scriptus est:
   (Hosea 13, 14, vel les. 25, 8.) Absorpta est mors in victoriam.

   55. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

   55. Ubi, mors, tuus aculeus? Ubi tua, inferne, victoria?

   56. The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

   56. Aculeus autem mortis, peccatum est: virtus autem peccati, Lex.

   57. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   57. Sed Deo gratia, qui dedit nobis victoriam per Dominum nostrum Iesum
   Christum.

   58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
   labour is not in vain in the Lord.

   58. Itaque, fratres mei dilecti, stabiles sitis, immobiles, abundantes
   in opere Domini semper, hoc cognifo, quod labor vester non sit inanis
   in Domino.


   Hitherto he has included two things in his reasoning. In the first
   place, he shows that there will be a resurrection from the dead:
   secondly, he shows of what nature it will be. Now, however, he enters
   more thoroughly into a description of the manner of it. This he calls a
   mystery, because it had not been as yet so clearly unfolded in any
   statement of revelation; but he does this to make them more attentive.
   For that wicked doctrine had derived strength from the circumstance,
   that they disputed as to this matter carelessly and at their ease;
   [127] as if it were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by
   the term mystery, he admonishes them to learn a matter, which was not
   only as yet unknown to them, but ought to be reckoned among God's
   heavenly secrets.

   51. We shall not indeed all sleep. Here there is no difference in the
   Greek manuscripts, but in the Latin versions there are three different
   readings. The first is, We shall indeed all die, but we shall not all
   be changed. The second is, We shall indeed all rise again, but we shall
   not all be changed. [128] The third is, We shall not indeed all sleep,
   but we shall all be changed. This diversity, I conjecture, had arisen
   from this -- that some readers, who were not the most discerning,
   dissatisfied with the true reading, ventured to conjecture a reading
   which was more approved by them. [129] For it appeared to them, at
   first view, to be absurd to say, that all would not die, while we read
   elsewhere, that it is appointed unto all men once to die. (Hebrews
   9:27.) Hence they altered the meaning in this way -- All will not be
   changed, though all will rise again, or will die; and the change they
   interpret to mean -- the glory that the sons of God alone will obtain.
   The true reading, however, may be judged of from the context.

   Paul's intention is to explain what he had said -- that we will be
   conformed to Christ, because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
   of God. A question presented itself, [130] what then will become of
   those who will be still living at the day of the Lord? His answer is,
   that although all will not die, yet they will be renewed, that
   mortality and corruption may be done away. It is to be observed,
   however, that he speaks exclusively of believers; for although the
   resurrection of the wicked will also involve change, yet as there is no
   mention made of them here, we must consider everything that is said, as
   referring exclusively to the elect. We now see, how well this statement
   corresponds with the preceding one, for as he had said, that we shall
   bear the image of Christ, he now declares, that this will take place
   when we shall be changed, so that

   mortality may be swallowed up of life, (2 Corinthians 5:4,)

   and that this renovation is not inconsistent with the fact, that
   Christ's advent will find some still alive.

   We must, however, unravel the difficulty -- that it is appointed unto
   all men once to die; and certainly, it is not difficult to unravel it
   in this way -- that as a change cannot take place without doing away
   with the previous system, that change is reckoned, with good reason, a
   kind of death; but, as it is not a separation of the soul from the
   body, it is not looked upon as an ordinary death. It will then be
   death, inasmuch as it will be the destruction of corruptible nature: it
   will not be a sleep, inasmuch as the soul will not quit the body; but
   there will be a sudden transition from corruptible nature into a
   blessed immortality.

   52. In a moment This is still of a general nature; that is, it includes
   all. For in all the change will be sudden and instantaneous, because
   Christ's advent will be sudden. And to convey the idea of a moment, he
   afterwards makes use of the phrase twinkling (or jerk) of the eye, for
   in the Greek manuscripts there is a twofold, reading -- rhopho (jerk,)
   or rhipho (twinkling.) [131] It matters nothing, however, as to the
   sense. Paul has selected a movement of the body, that surpasses all
   others in quickness; for nothing is more rapid than a movement of the
   eye, though at the same time he has made an allusion to sleep, with
   which twinkling of the eye is contrasted. [132]

   With the last trump. Though the repetition of the term might seem to
   place it beyond a doubt, that the word trumpet is here taken in its
   proper acceptation, yet I prefer to understand the expression as
   metaphorical. In 1 Thessalonians 4:16, he connects together the voice
   of the archangel and the trump of God: As therefore a commander, with
   the sound of a trumpet, summons his army to battle, so Christ, by his
   far sounding proclamation, which will be heard throughout the whole
   world, will summon all the dead. Moses tells us, (Exodus 19:16,) what
   loud and terrible sounds were uttered on occasion of the promulgation
   of the law. Far different will be the commotion then, when not one
   people merely, but the whole world will be summoned to the tribunal of
   God. Nor will the living only be convoked, but even the dead will be
   called forth from their graves. [133] Nay more, a commandment must be
   given to dry bones and dust that, resuming their former appearance and
   reunited to the spirit, they come forth straightway as living men into
   the presence of Christ.

   The dead shall rise What he had declared generally as to all, he now
   explains particularly as to the living and the dead. This distinction,
   therefore, is simply an exposition of the foregoing statement -- that
   all will not die, but all will be changed "Those who have already
   died," says he, "will rise again incorruptible." See what a change
   there will be upon the dead! "Those," says he, "who will be still alive
   will themselves also be changed." You see then as to both. [134] You
   now then perceive how it is, that change will be common to all, but not
   sleep. [135]

   When he says, We shall be changed, he includes himself in the number of
   those, who are to live till the advent of Christ. As it was now the
   last times, (1 John 2:18,) that day (2 Timothy 1:18) was to be looked
   for by the saints every hour. At the same time, in writing to the
   Thessalonians, he utters that memorable prediction respecting the
   scattering [136] that would take place in the Church before Christ's
   coming. (2 Thessalonians 2:3.) This, however, does not hinder that he
   might, by bringing the Corinthians, as it were, into immediate contact
   with the event, associate himself and them with those who would at that
   time be alive.

   53. For this corruptible must Mark, how we shall live in the kingdom of
   God both in body and in soul, while at the same time flesh and blood
   cannot inherit the kingdom of God -- for they shall previously be
   delivered from corruption. Our nature then, as being now corruptible
   and mortal, is not admissible into the kingdom of God, but when it
   shall have put off corruption, and shall have been beautified with
   in-corruption, it will then make its way into it. This passage, too,
   distinctly proves, that we shall rise again in that same flesh that we
   now carry about with us, as the Apostle assigns a new quality to it
   which will serve as a garment. If he had said, This corruptible must be
   renewed, the error of those fanatics, who imagine that mankind will be
   furnished with new bodies, would not have been so plainly or forcibly
   overthrown. Now, however, when he declares that this corruptible shall
   be invested with glory, there is no room left for cavil.

   54. Then shall be brought to pass the saying This is not merely an
   amplification, (epexergasia,) [137] but a confirmation, too, of the
   preceding statement. For what was foretold by the Prophets must be
   fulfilled. Now this prediction will not be fulfilled, until our bodies,
   laying aside corruption, will put on incorruption Hence this last
   result, also, is necessary. To come to pass, is used here in the sense
   of being fully accomplished, for what Paul quotes is now begun in us,
   and is daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not
   have its complete fulfillment until the last day.

   It does not, however, appear quite manifest, from what passage he has
   taken this quotation, for many statements occur in the Prophets to this
   effect. Only the probability is, that the first clause is taken either
   from Isaiah 25:8, where it is said that death will be for ever
   destroyed by the Lord, [138] or, (as almost all are rather inclined to
   think,) from Hosea 13:14, where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate
   wickedness of Israel, complains that he was like an untimely child,
   that struggles against the efforts of his mother in travail, that he
   may not come forth from the womb, and from this he concludes, that it
   was owing entirely to himself, that he was not delivered from death. I
   will ransom them, says he, from the power of the grave: I will rescue
   them from death. It matters not, whether you read these words in the
   future of the indicative, or in the subjunctive [139] for in either way
   the meaning amounts to this -- that God was prepared to confer upon
   them salvation, if they would have allowed the favor to be conferred
   upon them, and that, therefore, if they perished, it was their own
   fault.

   He afterwards adds, I will be thy destruction, O death! thy ruin, O
   grave! In these words God intimates, that he accomplishes the salvation
   of his people [140] only when death and the grave are reduced to
   nothing. For no one will deny, that in that passage there is a
   description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not see such a
   destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that
   complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that,
   consequently, it is delayed until that day. Then, accordingly, will
   death be swallowed up, that is, it will be reduced to nothing, [141]
   that we may have manifestly, in every particular, and in every respect,
   (as they say,) a complete victory over it. [142]

   As to the second clause, in which he triumphs over death and the grave,
   it is not certain whether he speaks of himself, or whether he meant
   there also to quote the words of the Prophet. For where we render it,
   "I will be thy destruction, O death! -- thy ruin, O grave!" the Greeks
   have translated it, "Where, O death, is thy suit? [143] where, O grave,
   thy sting?" Now although this mistake of the Greeks is excusable from
   the near resemblance of the words, [144] yet if any one will
   attentively examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite
   away from the Prophet's intention. The true meaning, then, will be this
   -- that the Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is
   possible, however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use,
   Paul alluded to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though
   he has not quoted literally, for instead of victory he has used the
   term action, or law-suit. [145] I am certainly of opinion, that the
   Apostle did not deliberately intend to call in the Prophet as a
   witness, with the view of making a wrong use of his authority, but
   simply accommodated, in passing, to his own use a sentiment that had
   come into common use, as being, independently of this, of a pious
   nature. [146] The main thing is this -- that Paul, by an exclamation of
   a spirited nature, designed to rouse up the minds of the Corinthians,
   and lead them on, as it were, to a near view of the resurrection. Now,
   although we do not as yet behold the victory with our eyes, and the day
   of triumph has not yet arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must
   every day be encountered,) yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have
   occasion to observe ere long, is not at all thereby diminished.

   56. The sting of death is sin In other words, "Death has no dart with
   which to wound us except sin, since death proceeds from the anger of
   God. Now it is only with our sins that God is angry. Take away sin,
   therefore, and death will no more be able to harm us." This agrees with
   what he said in Romans 6:23, that the wages of sin is death. Here,
   however, he makes use of another metaphor, for he compared sin to a
   sting, with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly
   wound. Let that be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no
   longer hurtful. Now with what view Paul says this will be explained by
   him ere long.

   The strength of sin is the law It is the law of God that imparts to
   that sting its deadly power, because it does not merely discover our
   guilt, but even increases it. A clearer exposition of this statement
   may be found in Romans 7:9, where Paul teaches us that we are alive, so
   long as we are without the law, because in our own opinion it is well
   with us, and we do not feel our own misery, until the law summons us to
   the judgment of God, and wounds our conscience with an apprehension of
   eternal death. Farther, he teaches us that sin has been in a manner
   lulled asleep, but is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously.
   Meanwhile, however, he vindicates the law from calumnies, on the ground
   that it is holy, and good, and just, and is not of itself the parent of
   sin or the cause of death. Hence he concludes, that whatever there is
   of evil is to be reckoned to our own account, inasmuch as it manifestly
   proceeds from the depravity of our nature. Hence the law is but the
   occasion of injury. The true cause of ruin is in ourselves. Hence he
   speaks of the law here as the strength or power of sin, because it
   executes upon us the judgment of God. In the mean time he does not
   deny, that sin inflicts death even upon those that know not the law;
   but he speaks in this manner, because it exercises its tyranny upon
   them with less violence. For the law came that sin might abound,
   (Romans 5:20,) or that it might become beyond measure sinful. (Romans
   7:13.)

   57. But thanks be to God From this it appears, why it it was that he
   made mention both of sin and of the law, when treating of death. Death
   has no sting with which to wound except sin, and the law imparts to
   this sting a deadly power. But Christ has conquered sin, and by
   conquering it has procured victory for us, and has redeemed us from the
   curse of the law. (Galatians 3:13.) Hence it follows, that we are no
   longer lying under the power of death. Hence, although we have not as
   yet a full discovery of those benefits, yet we may already with
   confidence glory in them, because it is necessary that what has been
   accomplished in the Head should be accomplished, also, in the members.
   We may, therefore, triumph over death as subdued, because Christ's
   victory is ours.

   When, therefore, he says, that victory has been given to us, you are to
   understand by this in the first place, that it is inasmuch as Christ
   has in his own person abolished sin, has satisfied the law, has endured
   the curse, has appeased the anger of God, and has procured life; and
   farther, because he has already begun to make us partakers of all those
   benefits. For though we still carry about with us the remains of sin,
   it, nevertheless, does not reign in us: though it still stings us, it
   does not do so fatally, because its edge is blunted, so that it does
   not penetrate into the vitals of the soul. Though the law still
   threatens, yet there is presented to us on the other hand, the liberty
   that was procured for us by Christ, which is an antidote to its
   terrors. Though the remains of sin still dwell in us, yet the Spirit
   who raised up Christ from the dead is life, because of righteousness.
   (Romans 8:10.) Now follows the conclusion.

   58. Wherefore, my brethren Having satisfied himself that he had
   sufficiently proved the doctrine of the resurrection, he now closes his
   discussion with an exhortation; and this has much more force, than if
   he had made use of a simple conclusion with an affirmation. Since your
   labor, says he, is not in vain in the Lord, be steadfast, and abound in
   good works Now he says that their labor is not in vain, for this
   reason, that there is a reward laid up for them with God. This is that
   exclusive hope which, in the first instance, encourages believers, and
   afterwards sustains them, so that they do not stop short in the race.
   Hence he exhorts them to remain steadfast, because they rest on a firm
   foundation, as they know that a better life is prepared for them in
   heaven.

   He adds -- abounding in the work of the Lord; for the hope of a
   resurrection makes us not be weary in well doing, as he teaches in
   Colossians 1:10. For amidst so many occasions of offense as constantly
   present themselves to us, who is there that would not despond, or turn
   aside from the way, were it not that, by thinking of a better life he
   is by this means kept in the fear of God? Now, on the other hand, he
   intimates, that if the hope of a resurrection is taken away, then, the
   foundation (as it were) being rooted up, the whole structure of piety
   falls to the ground. [147] Unquestionably, if the hope of reward is
   taken away and extinguished, alacrity in running will not merely grow
   cold, but will be altogether destroyed.

   by the way, the Apostle intended death also in the moral sense. And the
   insulting inquiry, where is it?' implies tis not any where to be found;
   and signifies a total abolition of it, and, by consequence, must infer
   that every thing of death besides must, as to them, for ever cease and

   Apostle's words differ only by the transposition of nikos (victory) and
   kentron, (sting,) from the ancient versions; except that for nikos the
   Sept. has dikn (law-suit.)" It is noticed, however, by Granville Penn,
   that "in the most ancient of all the existing MSS. (Vat. and Ephr.)
   there is no transposition of thanatos (death) and kentron, (sting;) and
   the Apostle's sentence preserves the same order as in the Greek of
   Hosea; so that the transposition lies wholly at the door of those MSS.
   which are more recent than those ancient copies." The Vat. version has
   neikos; instead of nikos, but from the circumstance that in that
   version neikos is used in the 54th verse manifestly instead of nikos,
   it abundantly appears that it is a mere difference of spelling. The

   1 Corinthians 16:1-7

   1. Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order
   to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

   1. Caeterum de collecta quae fit in sanctos, quemadmodum ordinavi
   Ecclesiis Galatiae, ita et vos facite.

   2. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
   store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I
   come.

   2. In una sabbatorum unusquisque vestrum apud se seponat, thesaurizans
   quod successerit, ne, quum venero, tunc collectae fiant. [148]

   3. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them
   will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

   3. Ubi autem affuero, quos probaveritis per epistolas, eos mittam, ut
   perferant beneficentiam vestram in Ierusalem.

   4. And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

   4. Quodsi fuerit operae pretium me quoque proficisci, mecum
   proficiscentur.

   5. Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I
   do pass through Macedonia.

   5. Veniam autem ad vos, quum Macedoniam transiero: Macedoniam enim
   pertransiturus sum.

   6. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye
   may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

   6. Apud vos autem forte permanebo, aut etiam hibernabo, ut vos me
   deducatis quocunque proficiscar.

   7. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while
   with you, if the Lord permit.

   7. Nolo enim vos nunc in transcursu videre: sed spero me ad aliquod
   tempus mansurum apud vos, si Dominus permiserit.


   1. But concerning the collection Luke relates (Acts 11:28) that the
   prediction of Agabus, foretelling that there would be a famine under
   Claudius Caesar, gave occasion for alms being collected by the saints,
   with the view of affording help to the brethren in Jerusalem. For
   though the Prophet had foretold, that this calamity would be generally
   prevalent almost throughout the world, yet as they were more heavily
   oppressed with penury at Jerusalem, and as all the Gentile Churches
   were bound, if they would not be held guilty of very great ingratitude,
   to afford aid to that place from which they had received the gospel,
   every one, consequently, forgetful of self, resolved to afford relief
   to Jerusalem. That the pressure of want was felt heavily at Jerusalem,
   appears from the Epistle to the Galatians, (Galatians 2:10,) where Paul
   relates, that he had been charged by the Apostles to stir up the
   Gentiles to afford help. [149] Now the Apostles would never have given
   such a charge, had they not been constrained by necessity. Farther,
   this passage is an evidence of the truth of what Paul states there also
   -- that he had been careful to exhort the Gentiles to afford help in
   such a case of necessity. Now, however, he prescribes the method of
   relief; and that the Corinthians may accede to it the more readily, he
   mentions that he had already prescribed it to the Churches of Galatia;
   for they would necessarily be the more influenced by example, as we are
   wont to feel a natural backwardness to anything that is not ordinarily
   practiced. Now follows the method -- by which he designed to cut off
   all hinderances and impediments.

   2. On one of the Sabbaths. The end is this -- that they may have their
   alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts them not to wait till he came,
   as anything that is done suddenly, and in a bustle, is not done well,
   but to contribute on the Sabbath what might seem good, and according as
   every one's ability might enable -- that is, on the day on which they
   held their sacred assemblies. The clause rendered on one of the
   Sabbaths, (kata mian sabbaton,) Chrysostom explains to mean -- the
   first Sabbath. In this I do not agree with him; for Paul means rather
   that they should contribute, one on one Sabbath and another on another;
   or even each of them every Sabbath, if they chose. For he has an eye,
   first of all, to convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in
   which the communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional
   spur to them. Nor am I more inclined to admit the view taken by
   Chrysostom -- that the term Sabbath is employed here to mean the Lord's
   day, (Revelation 1:10,) for the probability is, that the Apostles, at
   the beginning, retained the day that was already in use, but that
   afterwards, constrained by the superstition of the Jews, they set aside
   that day, and substituted another. Now the Lord's day was made choice
   of, chiefly because our Lord's resurrection put an end to the shadows
   of the law. Hence the day itself puts us in mind of our Christian
   liberty. We may, however, very readily infer from this passage, that
   believers have always had a certain day of rest from labor -- not as if
   the worship of God consisted in idleness, but because it is of
   importance for the common harmony, that a certain day should be
   appointed for holding sacred assemblies, as they cannot be held every
   day. For as to Paul's forbidding elsewhere (Galatians 4:10) that any
   distinction should be made between one day and another, that must be
   understood to be with a view to religion, [150] and not with a view to
   polity or external order. [151]

   Treasuring up I have preferred to retain the Greek participle, as it
   appeared to me to be more emphatic. [152] For although thesanrizein
   means to lay up, yet in my opinion, he designed to admonish the
   Corinthians, that whatever they might contribute for the saints would
   be their best and safest treasure. For if a heathen poet could say --
   "What riches you give away, those alone you shall always have, [153]
   how much more ought that consideration to have influence among us, who
   are not dependent on the gratitude of men, but have God to look to, who
   makes himself a debtor in the room of the poor man, to restore to us
   one day, with large interest, whatever we give away? (Proverbs 19:17.)
   Hence this statement of Paul corresponds with that saying of Christ --

   Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where it will not be exposed
   either to thieves, or to moths. (Matthew 6:20.)

   According as he has prospered. Instead of this the old translation has
   rendered it, What may seem good to him, misled, no doubt, by the
   resemblance between the word made use of, and another. [154] Erasmus
   renders it, What will be convenient. [155] Neither the one nor the
   other pleased me, for this reason -- that the proper signification of
   the word brings out a meaning that is much more suitable; for it means
   -- to go on prosperously. Hence he calls every one to consider his
   ability -- "Let every one, according as God hath blessed him, lay out
   upon the poor from his increase."

   3. And when I come As we are cheerful in giving, when we know for
   certain, that what we give is well laid out, he points out to the
   Corinthians a method, by which they may be assured of a good and
   faithful administration -- by selecting approved persons, to whom they
   may intrust the matter. Nay more, he offers his own services, if
   desired, which is an evidence that he has the matter at heart.

   5. When I shall pass through Macedonia The common opinion is, that this
   espistle was sent from Philippi. Persons coming thence to Corinth by
   land, required to pass through Macedonia; for that colony is situated
   in the farthest extremity, towards the Emathian mountains. Paul, it is
   true, might, instead of going by land, have gone thither by sea, but he
   was desirous to visit the Macedonian Churches, that he might confirm
   them in passing. So much for the common opinion. To me, however, it
   appears more probable, that the epistle was written at Ephesus; for he
   says a little afterwards, that he will remain there until Pentecost, (1
   Corinthians 16:8) [156] ; and he salutes the Corinthians, not in the
   name of the Philippians, but of the Asiatics. (1 Corinthians 16:19.)
   [157] Besides, in the second epistle he explicitly states, that, after
   he had sent away this epistle, he passed over into Macedonia. (2
   Corinthians 2:13.) Now after passing through Macedonia, he would be at
   a distance from Ephesus, and in the neighborhood of Achaia. Hence I
   have no doubt that he was at Ephesus at that time: thence he could sail
   by a straight course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit
   was needed, and a more disagreeable route. Accordingly he lets them
   know that he will not come to them by a direct course, as he required
   to go through Macedonia

   To the Corinthians, however, he promises something farther -- that he
   would make a longer stay with them By this he shows his affection
   towards them. For what reason had he for delay, except that he was
   concerned as to their welfare? On the other hand, he lets them know how
   fully assured he is of their affection towards him in return, by taking
   it, as it were, for granted that he would be conducted forward by them
   in the way of kindness; for he says this from confidence in their
   friendship. [158]

   After saying everything, however, he subjoins this limitation -- if the
   Lord permit With this reservation, saints ought to follow up all their
   plans and deliberations; for it is an instance of great rashness to
   undertake and determine many things for the future, while we have not
   even a moment in our power. The main thing indeed is, that, in the
   inward affection of the mind, we submit to God and his providence,
   whatever we resolve upon; [159] but at the same time, it is becoming
   that we should accustom ourselves to such forms of expression, that
   whenever we have to do with what is future we may make everything
   depend on the divine will. [160]

   1 Corinthians 16:8-12

   8. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

   8. Commorabor autem Ephesi usque ad Pentecosten.

   9. For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many
   adversaries.

   9. Nam ostium milli aperture est magnum et efficax, et [161] adversarii
   multi.

   10. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear:
   for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do

   10. Quodsi venerit Timotheus, videte, ut absque metu sit apud vos: opus
   enim Domini operatur, quemadmodum et ego.

   11. Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace,
   that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.

   11. Ne quis igitur eum spernat: sed prosequamini eum cum pace, [162] ut
   veniat ad me: exspecto enim eum cum fratribus.

   12. As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto
   you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this
   time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.

   12. Porro de Apollo fratre, multum hortatus sum illum, ut veniret ad
   vos cum fratribus, at omnino non fuit voluntas nunc eundi: veniet
   autem, quam opportunitatem nactus erit.


   8. I will remain. From this statement I have argued above, that this
   epistle was sent from Ephesus, rather than from Philippi. For the
   probability is, that the Apostle speaks of the place in which he was at
   the time, and not of a place, in going to which he would require to
   make a long circuit; and farther, in passing through Macedonia, [163]
   it would have been necessary to leave Corinth when already in the
   neighborhood of it, and cross the sea in order to reach Ephesus. He
   accordingly tells them beforehand that he will remain at Ephesus until
   Pentecost, adding the reason -- in order that they may wait for him the
   more patiently. Erasmus has preferred to render it -- until the
   fiftieth day, influenced by frivolous conjectures rather than by any
   solid argument. He objects, that there was as yet no day of Pentecost
   appointed among Christians, as it is now celebrated; and this I grant.
   He says, that it ought not to be understood as referring to the Jewish
   solemnity, because in various instances he annuls and condemns the
   superstitious observance of days. (Galatians 4:10; Romans 14:5;
   Colossians 2:16, 17.) I do not concede to him, however, that Paul
   celebrated that day at Ephesus from being influenced by a superstitious
   regard to the day, but because there would be a larger assembly at that
   time, and he hoped that, in that way, an opportunity would be presented
   to him of propagating the gospel. Thus, when he was hastening forward
   to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste, that he might
   arrive there at Pentecost, (Acts 20:16;) but while others presented
   themselves there for the purpose of sacrificing according to the ritual
   of the law, he himself had another object in view -- that his ministry
   might be the more useful in proportion to the largeness of the
   attendance. It were, however, an excessively poor meaning to understand
   Paul here as simply specifying fifty days. Besides, when he expressly
   says ten pentekosten (the Pentecost,) he cannot but be understood as
   speaking of a particular day. As to this festival, see Leviticus 23:16

   9. For a great and effectual door is opened to me. He assigns two
   reasons for remaining for a longer time at Ephesus -- 1st, Because an
   opportunity is afforded him there of furthering the gospel; and 2dly,
   Because, in consequence of the great number of adversaries that were
   there, his presence was particularly required. "I shall do much good by
   prolonging my stay here for a little while, and were I absent, Satan
   would do much injury." In the first clause, he makes use of a metaphor
   that is quite in common use, when he employs the term door as meaning
   an opportunity. For the Lord opened up a way for him for the
   furtherance of the gospel. He calls this a great door, because he could
   gain many. He calls it effectual, inasmuch as the Lord blessed his
   labor, and rendered his doctrine effectual by the power of His Spirit.
   We see, then, how this holy man [164] sought everywhere Christ's glory,
   and did not select a place with a view to his own convenience or his
   own pleasure; but simply looked to this -- where he might do most good,
   and serve his Lord with most abundant fruit; and in addition to this,
   he did not merely not shrink back from hardships, but presented
   himself, of his own accord, where he saw that he would have to contend
   more keenly, and with greater difficulty. For the reason why he
   remained [165] was, that many adversaries were at hand; and the better
   equipped he was for enduring their assault, he required to be so much
   the better prepared, and the more resolute.

   10. But if Timothy come. He speaks as if he were not as yet certain as
   to his coming. Now he charges them as to Timothy, so that he may be
   with them in safety -- not as though he were in danger of his life
   among them, but because he would have enemies of Christ [166] to oppose
   him. He wishes, therefore, that they should carefully take heed that no
   injury be done to him.

   He adds the reason -- for he worketh the work of the Lord Hence we
   infer, that the Church of Christ ought to be concerned for the
   preservation of the lives of ministers. And assuredly, it is
   reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed with
   superior gifts for the edification of believers, and applies himself to
   it the more strenuously, his life ought to be so much dearer to us.

   The clause -- as I also do, is made use of, either to express his
   excellence, or simply to point out the similarity as to office,
   inasmuch as both labored in the word.

   11. Let no man, therefore, despise him Here we have a second charge,
   that they may not despise him -- perhaps because he was as yet of a
   youthful age, which usually draws forth less respect. He wishes them,
   therefore, to take care, that there be no hinderance in the way of this
   faithful minister of Christ being held in due esteem -- unless,
   perhaps, it be that Paul reckoned this very thing to be an evidence of
   contempt, if they were not concerned, as it became them to be, in
   reference to his life. This injunction, however, appears to include
   something farther, that they should not undervalue Timothy, from
   ignorance of his worth.

   In the third place, he charges them to conduct him forward in peace,
   or, in other words, safe from all harm, for peace here means safety.

   12. As to our brother Apollos. He had succeeded Paul in the work of
   building up the Corinthians; and hence he has in previous passages
   ascribed to him the office of watering. (1 Corinthians 3:6, and Acts
   19:1.) He now states a reason why he does not come with the others, and
   he states the reason of this, in order that the Corinthians may not
   suspect that he had been hindered by him. For the better he was known
   by them, they were so much the more favourably disposed towards him,
   and they would be the more ready to conjecture, that matters had been
   designedly contrived, that he should not go to them, in consequence of
   offense having been taken. [167] They might, at least, be prepared to
   inquire among themselves: "Why has he sent these persons to us rather
   than Apollos?" He answers, that it was not owing to him, inasmuch as he
   entreated him; but he promises that he will come as soon as he has
   opportunity.

   1 Corinthians 16:13-24

   13. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

   13. Vigilate, state in fide, viriliter agite, robusti estote.

   14. Let all your things be done with charity.

   14. Omnia vestra in caritate fiant.

   15. I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it
   is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to
   the ministry of the saints,)

   15. Hortor autem vos, fratres, nostis domum Stephanae, primitias esse
   Achaiae, atque ut se in ministerium sanctorum ordinaverint:

   16. That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth
   with us, and laboureth.

   16. Ut etiam subiecti sitis tallbus, et omnibus qui cooperantur et
   laborant.

   17. I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus:
   for that which was lacking on our part they have supplied.

   17. Gaudeo autem de praesentia Stephanie, et Fortunati, et Achaici:
   quia quod deerat a vobis, ipsi suppleverunt.

   18. For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge
   ye them that are such.

   18. Refocillarunt enim spiritum meum et vestrum: agnoscite ergo tales.

   19. The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
   much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

   19. Salutant vos Ecclesiae Asiae: salutant vos multum in Domino Aquila
   et Priscilla cum domestica eorum Ecclesia.

   20. All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.

   20. Salutant vos fratres omnes: salutate vos invicem in osculo sancto.

   21. The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

   21. Salutatio mea manu Pauli.

   22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
   Maranatha.

   22. Si quis non amat Dominum Iesum Christum, sit anathema maranatha.

   23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

   23. Gratia Domini Iesu Christi sit vobiscum.

   24. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

   24. Dilectio mea cum vobis omnibus in Christo Iesu. Amen.

   The first epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by
   Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus.

   Ad Corinthios prior missa fuit e Philippis per Stephanam, et
   Fortunatum, et Andronicum, et Timotheum. [168]


   13. Watch ye. A short exhortation, but of great weight. He exhorts them
   to watch, in order that Satan may not oppress them, finding them off
   their guard. For as the warfare is incessant, the watching requires to
   be incessant too. Now watchfulness of spirit is this -- when, free and
   disentangled from earthly cares, we meditate on the things of God. For
   as the body is weighed down by surfeiting and drunkenness, (Luke
   21:34,) so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the
   world, idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting that
   overpowers the mind. [169]

   The second thing is that they persevere in the faith, or that they hold
   fast the faith, so as to stand firm; because that is the foundation on
   which we rest. It is certain, however, that he points out the means of
   perseverance -- by resting upon God with a firm faith.

   In the third exhortation, which is much of the same nature, he stirs
   them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are naturally weak, he exhorts
   them fourthly to strengthen themselves, or gather strength. For where
   we render it be strong, Paul makes use of only one word, which is
   equivalent to strengthen yourselves.

   14. Let all your things be done in love Again he repeats what is the
   rule in all those transactions, in which we have dealings with one
   another. He wishes, then, that love shall be the directress; because
   the Corinthians erred chiefly in this respect -- that every one looked
   to himself without caring for others.

   15. Ye know the house of Stephanas We know, from daily experience, of
   what advantage it is, that those should have the highest authority,
   whom God has adorned with the most distinguished gifts. Accordingly, if
   we wish to secure the welfare of the Church, let us always take care
   that honor be conferred upon the good: let their counsels have the
   greatest weight; let others give way to them, and allow themselves to
   be governed by their prudence. This Paul does in this instance, when
   admonishing the Corinthians to show respect to the house of Stephanas.
   Some manuscripts add, and Fortunatus. [170] For God manifests himself
   to us when he shows us the gifts of his Spirit. Hence, if we would not
   appear to be despisers of God, let us voluntarily submit ourselves to
   those, on whom God has conferred superior gifts.

   Now, that they may be the more inclined to put honor upon that house,
   (for as to the other, it appears to me to be, in this place at least, a
   spurious addition,) he reminds them that they were the first-fruits of
   Achaia, that is, that the household of Stephanas were the first that
   had embraced the gospel. Not indeed as though the first in order of
   time were in every case superior to the others, but where there is
   perseverance along with this, it is with good reason, that honor is
   conferred upon those, who have in a manner paved the way for the gospel
   by promptitude of faith. It must be observed, however, that he
   dignifies with this honorable title those, who had consecrated to
   believers their services and resources. For the same reason, he bestows
   commendation a little afterwards upon Fortunatus and Achaicus, that, in
   proportion to a man's superiority of excellence, [171] he might be held
   so much the more in esteem, that he might be able to do the more good.
   Farther, in order that the Corinthians may be the more disposed to love
   them, he says, that what had been wanting on the part of their entire
   Church had been compensated for by their vicarious services.

   19. With the Church that is in their house A magnificent eulogium,
   inasmuch as the name of the Church is applied to a single family! At
   the same time it is befitting, that all the families of the pious
   should be regulated in such a manner as to be so many little Churches.
   As to the term Congregation, which Erasmus has used in preference, it
   is foreign to Paul's design; for it was not his intention to designate
   a crowd of persons by a mere common term, but to speak in honorable
   terms of the management of a Christian household. His saluting them in
   the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what I have noticed above --
   that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at Philippi. For Luke
   informs us, that they remained at Ephesus, when Paul went elsewhere.
   (Acts 18:19.)

   20. Salute one another with a holy kiss. The practice of kissing was
   very common among the Jews, as is manifest from the Scriptures. In
   Greece, though it was not so common and customary, it was by no means
   unknown; but the probability is, that Paul speaks here of a solemn
   kiss, with which they saluted each other in the sacred assembly. For I
   could easily believe, that from the times of the Apostles a kiss was
   used in connection with the administration of the Supper; [172] in
   place of which, among nations that were somewhat averse to the practice
   of kissing, there crept in the custom of kissing the patine. [173]
   However this may be, as it was a token of mutual love. I have no doubt,
   that Paul meant to exhort them to the cultivation of good-will among
   themselves -- not merely in their minds [174] and in needful services,
   but also by that token, provided only it was holy, that is, neither
   unchaste nor deceitful, [175] -- though, at the same time, holy may be
   taken to mean sacred.

   22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus The close of the Epistle
   consists of three parts. He entreats the grace of Christ in behalf of
   the Corinthians: he makes a declaration of his love towards them, and,
   with the severest threatening, he inveighs against those that falsely
   took upon themselves the Lord's name, while not loving him from the
   heart. For he is not speaking of strangers, who avowedly hated the
   Christian name, but of pretenders and hypocrites, who troubled the
   Churches for the sake of their own belly, or from empty boasting. [176]
   On such persons he denounces an anathema, and he also pronounces a
   curse upon them. It is not certain, however, whether he desires their
   destruction in the presence of God, or whether he wishes to render them
   odious -- nay, even execrable, in the view of believers. Thus in
   Galatians 1:8, when pronouncing one who corrupts the Gospel to be
   accursed, [177] he does not mean that he was rejected or condemned by
   God, but he declares that he is to be abhorred by us. I expound it in a
   simple way as follows: "Let them perish and be cut off, as being the
   pests of the Church." And truly, there is nothing that is more
   pernicious, than that class of persons, who prostitute a profession of
   piety to their own depraved affections. Now he points out the origin of
   this evil, when he says, that they do not love Christ, for a sincere
   and earnest love to Christ will not suffer us to give occasion of
   offense to brethren. [178]

   What he immediately adds -- Maranatha, is somewhat more difficult.
   Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that they are Syriac terms.
   [179] Jerome, however, explains it: The Lord cometh; while others
   render it, At the coming of the Lord, or, Until the Lord comes. Every
   one, however, I think, must see how silly and puerile is the idea, that
   the Apostle spoke to Greeks in the Syriac tongue, when meaning to say
   -- The Lord has come. Those who translate it, at the coming of the
   Lord, do so on mere conjecture; and besides, there is not much
   plausibility in that interpretation. How much more likely it is, that
   this was a customary form of expression among the Hebrews, when they
   wished to excommunicate any one. For the Apostles never speak in
   foreign tongues, except when they repeat anything in the person of
   another, as for example, Eli, Eli, lammah sabathani, (Matthew 27:46,)
   Talitha cumi, (Mark 5:41,) and Ephphata, (Mark 7:34,) or when they make
   use of a word that has come into common use, as Amen -- Hosanna. Let us
   see, then, whether Maranatha suits with excommunication. Now Bullinger,
   [180] on the authority of Theodore Bibliander, has affirmed, that, in
   the Chaldee dialect, Maharamata has the same meaning as the Hebrew term
   chrm, cherem, (accursed,) [181] and I was myself at one time assured of
   the same thing by Wolfgang Capito, [182] a man of blessed memory It is
   nothing unusual, however, for the Apostles to write such terms
   differently from the way in which they are pronounced in the language
   from which they are derived; as may be seen even from the instances
   brought forward above. Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on
   those who do not love Christ, [183] deeply affected with the
   seriousness of the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said
   enough, added a term that was in common use among the Jews, and which
   they made use of in pronouncing a sentence of anathema -- just as if,
   speaking in Latin, I should say, "I excommunicate thee," but if I add
   -- "and pronounce thee an anathema," this would be an expression of
   more intense feeling. [184]

   END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON THE FIRST EPISTLE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [168] It appears from Hug (in his treatise on the antiquity of the
   Vatican version) that the subscription to this epistle in that version
   is as follows -- pros Korinthious a enraphe apo Ephesou -- The first to
   the Corinthians was written from Ephesus. This, it will be observed,
   favors the view taken by Calvin of the statement made by Paul in 1
   Corinthians 16:8. -- Ed.

   mind drowsy and stupid."

   [170] The Alex. and Copt. MSS. read -- and Fortunatus. The Vulgate
   reads -- Fortunatum et Achaicum; in accordance with which the rendering
   in Wiclif (1380) is, Ye knowen the hous of stephart and of fortunati,
   and acacie. The Rheims version (1582) reads -- You know the house of
   Ste-phanas and of Fortunatus. -- Ed.

   [171] "Selon que chacun estoit plus homme de bien et vertueux;" -- "In
   proportion as an individual was an honorable and virtuous man."

   [172] "That the Apostle," says Dr. Brown in his Commentary on 1st
   Peter, "meant the members of the Churches, on receiving this Epistle,
   to salute one another is certain; that he meant, that at all their
   religious meetings they should do so, is not improbable. That he meant
   to make this an everlasting ordinance in all Christian Churches, though
   it has sometimes been asserted, has never been proved, and is by no
   means likely. That the practice prevailed extensively, perhaps
   universally, in the earlier ages, is established on satisfactory
   evidence. After the prayers,' says Justin Martyr, who lived in the
   earlier part of the second century, giving an account in his Apology of
   the religious customs of the Christians -- 'after the prayers, we
   embrace each other with a kiss.' Tertullian speaks of it as an ordinary
   part of the religious services of the Lord's day; and in the
   Apostolical Constitutions, as they are termed, the manner in which it
   was performed is particularly described. Then let the men apart, and
   the women apart, salute each other with a kiss in the Lord.' Origen's
   Note on Romans 16:16, is: From this passage the custom was delivered to
   the Churches, that, after prayer, the brethren should salute one
   another with a kiss.' This token of love was generally given at the
   Holy Supper. It was likely, from the prevalence of this custom, that
   the calumny of Christians indulging in licentiousness at their
   religious meetings originated; and it is not improbable that, in order
   to remove everything like an occasion to calumniators, the practice
   which, though in itself innocent, had become not for the use of
   edifying, was discontinued." -- Brown's Expository Discourses on 1st
   Peter, volume in. pages 309, 310. "It is remarkable that, by the
   testimony of Suetonius, an edict was published by one of the Roman
   Emperors, for the abolition of this practice among his subjects, --
   perhaps in order to check abuses, for the prevention of which our
   Apostle enjoins that it shall be a holy salutation." -- Chalmers on the
   Romans, volume in. page 428. -- Ed.

   [173] By the patine or paten, is meant the plate or salver on which the
   wafer or bread was placed in the observance of the mass. The term is
   made use of by Dr. Stillingfleet in his "Preservative from Popery,"
   (title 7, chapter 5,) in speaking of the practice of the Church of Rome
   in the adoration of the host: "The priest in every mass, as soon as he
   has consecrated the bread and wine, with bended knees, he adores the
   sacrament; that which he has consecrated, that very thing which is
   before him, upon the patine, and in the chalice; and gives the same
   worship and subjection, both of body and mind, to it as he could to God
   or Christ himself." In Young's Lectures on Popery, (Loud. 1836,) page
   140, the following account is given of the sacrifice of the mass: "Upon
   the altar is the chalice, or cup, which is to contain the wine, mixed
   with a little water; and covering the cup is the paten, or plate,
   intended to hold the cake or wafer. After an almost endless variety of
   movements, and forms, and prayers, and readings, the priest goes to the
   altar, and, taking the cup containing wine and water, with the wafer
   upon the cover, -- these having been before consecrated and
   transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, -- he raises his
   eyes and says, Take, O Holy Trinity, this oblation, which I, unworthy
   sinner, offer in honor of thee, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of all
   the saints, for the salvation of the living, and for the rest and quiet
   of all the faithful that are dead.' Then, setting down the chalice, he
   says, Let this sacrifice be acceptable to Almighty God.'" The name
   paten is preserved in the English Liturgy to this day. In the prayer of
   consecration, in the communion service -- in connection with the words,
   "who, in the same night that he was betrayed, took bread," it is said,
   "here the priest is to take the paten into his hands." Calvin, when
   commenting upon Romans 16:16, after having stated that it was customary
   among the primitive Christians, before partaking of the Lord's Supper,
   to kiss each other in token of sacred friendship, and afterwards to
   give alms, says, "Hinc fluxit ritus ille, qui hodie est apud Papistas,
   osculandoe patents, et conferendse oblationis. Quorum alterum merae est
   superstitionis, sine ullo fructu: alterum non alto facit, nisi ad
   explendam sacerdotum avari-tiam, si tamen expleri posset;" -- "From
   this has sprung that ceremony which is at this day among Papists, of
   kissing the patine, and making an offering. The former is mere
   superstition without any advantage: the latter serves no purpose,
   except to satisfy the greed of the priests, if satisfied it can be."
   Poole, in his Annotations on Romans 16:16, says, "The primitive
   Christians did use it" (the holy kiss) "in their assemblies; so
   Tertullian testifieth, (Lib. Dec.,) and they did it especially in
   receiving the Eucharist. So Chrysostom witnesseth, (Hom. 77 in John
   16,) we do well,' saith he, to kiss in the mysteries, that we may
   become one.' This custom for good reasons is laid down, and the
   Romanists in room of it, keep up a foolish and superstitious ceremony,
   which is to kiss the pax in the mass." -- Ed.

   [174] "Par affection interieure;" -- "By inward affection."

   [175] "Ou consistast en mine seulement;" -- "Or consisted in mere
   appearance."

   [176] "Ne cherehans que le proufit de lents ventres, et leur propre
   gloire;" "Seeking only the profit of their bellies, and their own
   glory."

   [177] Calvin, when commenting on [11]Galatians 1:8, remarks that the
   original term there employed, anathema, denotes cursing, and answers to
   the Hebrew word chrm; and he explains the expression -- "let him be
   accursed," as meaning, "Let him be held by you as accursed."

   [178] "Car si nous aimons Christ purement, et a bon escient, ce nous
   sera vne bride qui nons retiendra de donner scandale a nos fieres;" --
   "For if we love Christ sincerely and in good earnest, this will be a
   bridle to restrain us from giving offense to our brethren."

   [179] "Que ce sont mots empruntez de la langue Syrienne;" -- "That they
   are words borrowed from the Syriac language."

   [180] Beza, in his poems, has recorded the following tribute to the
   memory of this distinguished man -- "Henrici Bullingeri, Ecclesiastae
   Tigurini, spectatisa, doctrine, pictaris, et eximii candoris viri,
   memoriae;" -- (To the memory of HENRY Bullinger, ecclesiastick of
   Tigurum, a man most distinguished for learning and piety, and
   extraordinary candour.) "Doctrina si interire, si Pietas mori,
   Occidere si Candor potest:
   Doctrina, Pietas, Candor, hoc tumulo iacent,
   Henrice, tecum condita.
   Mori sed absit ilia posse dixerim;
   Quae viuere jubent mortnos,
   Immo interire forsan ilia si queant
   Subireque tumuli specum,
   Tu tu, illa doctis, tu piis, tu candidis,
   Et non mori certissimis,
   Edaci ab ipsa morte chartis asseras,
   Ipso approbante Numine.
   Foedus beatum! mortuum ilia to excitant,
   Et tu mori ilia non sinis:
   At hunc, amici, cur fleamus mortuum,
   Qui viuat aliis et sibi?" "If Learning could expire, if Piety could
   die,
   If Candour could sink down,
   Learning, Piety, Candour, are laid in this mound,
   O Henry, buried along with thee!
   But forbid that I should say that those things could die,
   Which command the dead to live.
   Nay, if they could possibly expire,
   And be entombed,
   Thou, by thy writings learned, pious, candid,
   And perfectly secured against death,
   Wouldst shield them from devouring death,
   The Deity himself approving.
   Blessed agreement! They raise thee up from death,
   And thou dost not suffer them to die!
   But, my friends, why should we weep for him, as dead,
   Who lives to others and himself?" Beza's "Poemata Varia," -- Ed.

   [181] Thus in 1 Kings 20:42, we have the expression, 'ys-chrmy, (ish
   cheremi,) the man of my curse, or the man whom I anathematize. See also
   Isaiah 34:5; Zechariah 14:11. -- Ed.

   [182] Calvin, when [12]commenting on Philippians 3:5, having occasion
   to speak of the etymology of the term Pharisees, says that he
   considered it to be derived -- not as was commonly supposed, from a
   word signifying to separate -- -but from a term denoting
   interpretation, this having been the view given of it by Capito --
   "sanctae memoriae viro," -- "a man of sacred memory." It is stated by
   Beza in his life of Calvin, that when at Basle, Calvin lived on
   intimate terms with those two distinguished men, Simon Grynaeus and
   Wolfgang Capito, and devoted himself to the study of Hebrew. --
   Calvin's Tracts, volume 1. -- Ed.

   [183] "Ayant excommunie, et declare execrables ceux-la qui n'aiment
   point Iesus Christ;" -- "Having excommunicated, and pronounced
   execrable those who do not love Jesus Christ."

   [184] "Maran atha (Maran atha) is a Syro-Chaldee expression, signifying
   the Lord is to come,' i.e., will come, to take vengeance on the
   disobedient and vicious. Hence with the words Anathema Maranatha the
   Jews began their papers of excommunication." -- Bloomfield.

   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   The Epistles Of Paul To The Corinthians contain more of admonition and
   reproof than most of his other Epistles. While The Church Of Corinth
   was more than ordinarily distinguished in respect of spiritual gifts,
   it had fallen into corruptions and abuses, from which the other
   Churches appear to have been, to a great extent, free. There is,
   accordingly -- as might be expected -- in these Epistles, more frequent
   reference to local evils, than in most of the other Epistles of the New
   Testament. They are not, however, on that account the less adapted for
   general utility. While the reproofs which they contain were occasioned
   by the corrupt state of a particular Church, they will be found to
   involve general principles of the highest importance to the Church of
   Christ under all circumstances. The Epistles to the Corinthians "have,"
   says Dr. Guyse, in his Preface to the Second Epistle, "some advantages
   that are not to be met with in any other part of the word of God, as
   they may be deemed the seat of divine directions, relating to the
   spiritual privileges, rights, and powers, worship and discipline of the
   Churches of Christ; to the purity of doctrines, manners, and
   celebrations of Gospel ordinances; and to the unity, peace, and order,
   mutual watch and care, and religious respect to faithful pastors, that
   ought to be preserved among them."

   As, in the perusal of the four Gospels, the attentive reader can
   scarcely fail to observe, that many of the instructive sayings of our
   blessed Lord, which are placed on record by the Evangelists, arose
   naturally out of occurrences of an accidental nature, -- though taking
   place under the watchful superintendence of him

   without whom not even a sparrow falleth on the ground,
   (Matthew 10:29,)

   -- so we find a large portion of the invaluable directions furnished in
   the Epistles of the New Testament for the regulation of the Church in
   every subsequent age, presented incidentally -- as if suggested to the
   mind of the sacred writer by corruptions of doctrine and practice, into
   which some particular Church in the primitive age had been left to
   fall. While the unhappily corrupt state of the Church of Corinth, as
   indicated in the two Epistles addressed to it, tended to mar, in no
   inconsiderable degree, the prosperity of the cause of Christ in that
   city, and was an occasion of poignant grief to the mind of Paul, who
   felt the more solicitous for their welfare from his sustaining to them
   the relationship -- not simply of an instructor, but of a father, (1
   Corinthians 4:15,) the flagrant abuses which had crept in among them
   were, in the providence of God, overruled for good to the Church of
   Christ generally, by giving occasion for a fuller development than
   might otherwise have been necessary, of some of the most important
   principles of practical Christianity.

   The Epistles to the Church of Corinth are a portion of Paul's writings,
   which, as is justly observed by Dr. Alexander, in his Preface to
   Billroth on the Corinthians, "occupies a very important place in the
   sacred canon. Besides containing some loca classica upon several of the
   most essential positions in doctrinal theology, such, for instance, as
   the deity of Christ, the personality and agency of the Holy Spirit, the
   resurrection of the body, etc., the two Epistles to the Corinthians may
   be regarded as constituting the great code of practical ethics for the
   Christian Church. In this respect they stand to the science of
   practical theology in a relation analogous to that occupied by the
   Epistles to the Romans, the Galatians, and the Hebrews, to the science
   of systematic divinity; they contain the fullest development of those
   principles on which that science must rest, and the practices which its
   rules are to authorize or inculcate." [185]

   What increases not a little the utility of Paul's Epistles to the
   Corinthian Church is the circumstance that the latter Epistle was
   written by him a considerable time (about a year, it is generally
   supposed) subsequently to the former, when opportunity had been given
   for the Apostle's receiving accounts as to the effect produced upon the
   minds of the Corinthians by the faithful, though at the same time
   affectionate counsels and admonitions, which he had addressed to them
   in his first Epistle. The Apostle had been intensely anxious as to the
   effect, which his former Epistle might produce on the minds of the
   Corinthians. While his authority as an Apostle, and that too in a
   Church which he had himself planted, was at stake, he was, we may
   believe, chiefly concerned for the purity of doctrine and discipline,
   as in danger of being seriously impaired by the corrupt state of the
   Church of Corinth. With feelings of deep solicitude he left Ephesus,
   where it is generally believed he wrote his first Epistle to the
   Corinthian Church, and proceeded to Troas, a sea-port town on the coast
   of the AEgean Sea, hoping to meet with Titus there on his return from
   Corinth. Disappointed in this expectation, he went forward to
   Macedonia, where he at length met with Titus, and received most
   gratifying accounts as to the favorable reception, which his former
   Epistle had met with from the Corinthians, and the salutary effect
   which it had produced in remedying, to a great extent., the evils that
   he had found occasion to censure.

   It must have afforded to the mind of the Apostle no ordinary
   satisfaction to learn, that his admonitions and reproofs had awakened
   in the minds of the Corinthians the most poignant grief in reflecting
   on the unworthy part which they had acted -- that they had manifested
   unabated esteem and affection toward him as their spiritual father --
   that they had, in accordance with his instructions, excluded from their
   society a gross offender, whose unnatural crime they had too long
   connived at; and farther, that the exercise of discipline in that
   painful case had been most salutary in its effects upon the offender
   himself, so that the Apostle, from what he had learned as to the
   evidences of repentance, was now prepared to instruct the Corinthian
   Christians to receive him back, without hesitation or delay, into their
   fellowship. He had, also, the satisfaction of learning, that his
   exhortations, in the close of his former Epistle, to liberality in
   contributing for the relief of the "poor saints at Jerusalem," had been
   promptly and cheerfully responded to. While Paul's second Epistle to
   the Corinthians furnishes in these and other respects, express proofs
   of the beneficial effects of his former Epistle, his entire silence in
   the latter Epistle in reference to various evils unsparingly censured
   by him in the former, gives reason to believe that, in connection with
   these also, a more hopeful state of matters had begun to appear. Among
   these we may notice their party contendings, their vexatious lawsuits,
   their corrupt administration of the Sacred Supper, their disorderly
   exercise of spiritual gifts, and, in fine, their erroneous views on the
   important subject of the resurrection.

   Thus "the success" of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, as is
   justly observed by Barnes, in the Introduction to his Notes on that
   Epistle, "was all that Paul could desire. It had the effect to repress
   their growing strifes, to restrain their disorders, to produce true
   repentance, and to remove the person who had been guilty of incest in
   the Church. The whole Church was deeply affected with his reproofs, and
   engaged in hearty zeal in the work of reform. (2 Corinthians 7:9-11.)
   The authority of the Apostle was recognised, and his Epistle read with
   fear and trembling. (2 Corinthians 7:15.) The act of discipline which
   he had required on the incestuous person was inflicted by the whole
   Church. (2 Corinthians 2:6.) The collection which he had desired, (1
   Corinthians 16:1-4,) and in regard to which he had boasted of their
   liberality to others, and expressed the utmost confidence that it would
   be liberal, (2 Corinthians 9:2, 3,) was taken up agreeably to his
   wishes, and their disposition on the subject was such as to furnish the
   highest satisfaction to his mind. (2 Corinthians 7:13, 14.) Of the
   success of his letter, however, and of their disposition to take up the
   collection, Paul was not apprised until he had gone into Macedonia,
   where Titus came to him, and gave him information of the happy state of
   things in the Church at Corinth. (2 Corinthians 7:4-7, 13.) Never was a
   letter more effectual than this was, and never was authority in
   discipline exercised in a more happy and successful way."

   At the same time, Paul's second Epistle to the Corinthian Church is of
   a mixed character, being designed in part to rectify evils still
   existing among them, and to vindicate the Apostle from injurious
   aspersions, thrown out against him by the false teachers. In various
   parts of the Epistle, but more particularly toward the close, he
   establishes his claims to apostolical authority.

   A succinct view of the general tenor and design of this Epistle is
   given by Poole, in his Annotations, in the following terms: -- "The
   occasion of his" (Paul's) "writing this second Epistle seemeth to be
   partly the false teachers aspersing him:

   1. As an inconstant man, because he had promised to come in person to
   Corinth, and was not yet come; the reason of which he showeth, 2
   Corinthians 1, was not levity, but the troubles he met with in Asia,
   and his desire to hear that they had first reformed the abuses he had
   taxed them for.

   2. As an imperious man, because of the incestuous person against whom
   he had wrote; which charge he avoids, by showing the necessity of his
   writing in that manner, and giving new orders for the restoring him,
   upon the repentance he had showed.

   3. As a proud and vain-glorious man.

   4. As a contemptible person -- base in his person, as he expresseth it.

   The further occasions of his writing were -- to commend them for their
   kind reception of, and compliance with, the precepts and admonitions of
   his former Epistle, and their kind reception of Titus -- as also to
   exhort them to a liberal contribution to the necessities of the saints
   in Judea, to which they had showed their forwardness a year before; and
   his hearing that there was yet a party amongst them bad enough, that
   went on vilifying him and his authority, as well as in other sinful
   courses; against whom he vindicateth himself, magnifying his office,
   assuring them that he was about to come to Corinth, when they should
   find him present, such as being absent he had by his letters declared
   himself, if they were not reformed.

   "The substance, therefore, of this Epistle, is partly apologetical, or
   excusatory, where he excuseth himself for his not coming to Corinth so
   soon as he thought, and for his so severe writing as to the incestuous
   person -- partly hortatory, where he persuadeth them more generally to
   walk worthy of the gospel; more specially (2 Corinthians 8:9) to a
   liberal contribution to the saints -- partly minatory or threatening,
   where he threateneth severity against those whom, when he came amongst
   them, he should find contumacious and impenitent offenders. He
   concludes the Epistle (as usually) with a salutation of them, pious
   exhortations to them, and a prayer for them."

   Calvin, it will be observed, dedicates his Commentary on the second
   Epistle to the Corinthians to Melchior Wolmar, a man of great
   celebrity, under whom Calvin acquired a knowledge of the Greek
   language. "The academy of Bourges," says Beza, in his Life of Calvin,
   "had [...] acquired great celebrity through Andrew Alciat, (undoubtedly
   the first lawyer of his age,) who had been invited to it from Italy.
   Calvin thought right to study under him also. He accordingly went
   thither, and on grounds both religious and literary, formed a
   friendship with Melchior Wolmar, a German from Rothweil, and professor
   of Greek. I have the greater pleasure in mentioning his name, because
   he was my own teacher, and the only one I had from boyhood up to youth.
   His learning, piety, and other virtues, together with his admirable
   abilities as a teacher of youth, cannot be sufficiently praised. On his
   suggestion, and with his assistance, Calvin learned Greek. The
   recollection of the benefit which he thus received from Wolmar he
   afterwards publicly testified, by dedicating to him his Commentary on
   the First" (Second) "Epistle to the Corinthians." [186]

   The circumstances connected with his attendance on the instructions of
   that distinguished teacher are interesting, as giving occasion to mark
   the leadings of providence in preparing Calvin for the important work,
   which was afterwards assigned him in the Church of Christ. His father
   had originally intended him for the ministry, and procured for him a
   benefice in the cathedral church of Noyon, and afterwards the rectory
   of Pont-Eveque, the birthplace of his father.

   Not long afterwards, however, his father resolved to send him to study
   civil law, as a more likely means of worldly preferment, while in the
   mean time Calvin, having been made acquainted with the doctrines of the
   reformed faith by one of his own relations, Peter Robert Olivet, had
   begun to feel dissatisfied with the Romish Church, and had left off
   attendance on the public services of the Church. With the view of
   devoting himself to the study of law, he removed to Orleans, and placed
   himself under the tuition of Peter De L'etoile, a French lawyer of
   great celebrity, and made in a short time surprising progress, so that
   very frequently, in the absence of the professors, he supplied their
   place, and was regarded as a teacher rather than a pupil. He afterwards
   went to Bourges, with the view of prosecuting the study of law under
   the celebrated Andrew Alciat. While there he formed, as is stated in
   the foregoing extract from Beza's Life of Calvin, an intimate
   friendship with Melchior Wolmar, his instructor in the Greek tongue.
   Having received intimation of the sudden death of his father, he broke
   off abruptly the studies in which he was engaged, and having returned
   to Noyon, his native town, he soon afterwards devoted himself to other
   and higher pursuits. The study of civil law, to which he had devoted
   himself for a time, in compliance with his father's wishes, though
   ultimately abandoned, was not without its use, in connection with those
   sacred pursuits to which his subsequent life was devoted. It may be
   interesting to the reader to observe unequivocal evidences of this, as
   furnished in the following encomiums pronounced upon Calvin by two
   eminent writers of sound and unbiassed judgment: --

   "A founder," says Hooker, "it" (the Presbyterian polity) "had, whom,
   for mine own part, I think incomparably the wisest man that ever the
   French Church did enjoy, since the hour it enjoyed him. His bringing up
   was in the study of the civil law. Divine knowledge he gathered, not by
   hearing and reading, so much as by teaching others. For, though
   thousands were debtors to him as touching knowledge in that kind, yet
   he to none but only to God, the Author of that most blessed fountain,
   the Book of Life, and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with
   the helps of other learning, which were his guide." [187] "Calvin,"
   says M. D'alembert, "who with justice enjoyed a high reputation, was a
   scholar of the first order. He wrote in Latin as well as is possible in
   a dead language, and in French with a purity that was extraordinary for
   his time. This purity, which is to the present day admired by our
   critics, renders his writings greatly superior to almost all of the
   same age; as the works of MM. de Port Royal are still distinguished on
   the same account, from the barbarous rhapsodies of their opponents and
   contemporaries. Calvin being a skilful lawyer, and as enlightened a
   divine as a heretic can be, drew up, in concert with the magistrates, a
   code of laws," etc. [188]

   While Calvin's large acquirements in the study of civil law were thus
   eminently serviceable in other and higher departments of labor, the
   other branch of study cultivated by him while at Bourges -- the
   knowledge of the Greek tongue -- was more directly fitted to prepare
   him, though he little thought of it at the time, for the sacred
   pursuits in which Providence called him to engage, with devotedness and
   success, in after years. Under the tuition of Wolmar, he appears to
   have applied himself to the study of the Greek language with the
   greatest diligence and ardour. "He did not indeed," says Tholuck,
   "learn Greek before his residence in Bourges, but he could not have
   been then, at most, more than twenty-two years old; and it is not
   therefore strange, that, with his resolute spirit, he made himself
   complete master of it." [189] His instructor in this department,
   Melchior Wolmar, was a man of distinguished talent, and of high moral
   worth. Beza, who, as we have seen, expresses in his Life of Calvin, in
   the strongest terms, his esteem for Wolmar, his sole instructor, has
   furnished in his Icones, (French edition,) entitled, "Les vrais
   Pourtraits des Hommes illustres," (à Génève 1581, pp. 148-51,) the
   following interesting sketch of the leading particulars of the life of
   this distinguished man.

   "Melior Wolmar of Rotweil, Professor of Civil Law, and of the Greek
   Language, in the University of Tübingen, (originally called Melchior,
   but latterly Joachim Camerarius, a very learned personage, and also
   Professor of Literature in Tübingen, admiring the probity of Wolmar,
   softened the name and changed it thus,) was born at Rotweil, which is
   an allied town of the Cantons, was brought up at Berne, and studied at
   Paris, where he immediately became well known for his admirable
   expertness in the Greek and Latin languages, as also in the town of
   Orleans, and more particularly at Bourges, where, being in the pay of
   Margaret Of Valois, Queen Of Navarre, and Duchess of Berry, he read in
   Greek and in Latin, was admitted as teacher by the advice of Andrew
   Alciat, the prince of lawyers in our times. Farther, his house was
   frequented by men that were learned and fearers of God, among whom must
   be numbered John Calvin, who had no hesitation in placing himself under
   Wolmar, to learn from him the Greek language, he having opened a school
   expressly for certain young men of good family and of great hope, in
   which he succeeded so admirably, that there could not have been found a
   man better qualified for the successful training of youth, and there
   was no one who had educated in a proper manner so large a number as he
   had done.

   "France would have reaped more fruits of Melior's industry, had not the
   persecutions that arose against the Church of God, and respect for
   Ulrich, Duke Of Wittemberg, by whom he was invited, drawn him away to
   Tübingen in the year 1535, when, having read in law, and having
   interpreted Greek authors during upwards of twenty years with great
   honor, he was at length permitted to resign. Having retired, with his
   wife, named Margaret, to Isne, a town belonging to that lady, he was
   attacked with paralysis, and at the end of some months, he and his wife
   (overcome as she was with grief) died on the same day -- it being the
   will of God, that those whom a sacred friendship had held bound during
   the space of twenty-seven years complete, should be inclosed in the
   same tomb.

   "He was an accomplished personage in all the gifts that are requisite
   for making a man accomplished. Above all he was amazingly charitable to
   the poor, and at the same time so remote from ambition, that, while he
   had the Greek and Latin languages at his command, he put to the press
   nothing but an elegant preface, [190] introductory to the Grammar of
   Demetrius Chalcondyles.

   "Having had in my childhood, as my preceptor, so distinguished a
   personage, (revered by me, while he lived, as my own father), I have
   bewailed his death, and that of his wife, in three Latin Epigrams, now
   rendered into French. He died at Isne in the year 1561, at the age of
   64 years.

   Calvin's Commentary On The Second Epistle To The Corinthians appears to
   have been published by him only a few months after his Commentary on
   the First Epistle, his dedication to his Commentary on the Second
   Epistle bearing date 1st August 1546, while his first dedication to the
   Commentary on the First Epistle bears date 24th January 1546.

   In Senebier's Literary History of Geneva, quoted in Calvin on Genesis,
   (vol. 1.) a list of Calvin's Commentaries is given in the order in
   which they are supposed to have been published. In that list the
   Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans is placed first in order, and
   is stated to have been published in 1540. Next in order is the
   "Commentary on all the Epistles of Paul," which is stated to have been
   published in 1548. It will be observed, however, that while the
   Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans is supposed to have been
   published in 1540, the first dedication to the Commentary on the First
   Epistle to the Corinthians, and the dedication to the Commentary on the
   Second Epistle, both of them bear date 1546. It is stated by Beza in
   his Life of Calvin, that during the contentions which prevailed in the
   Church in 1548, and some preceding years, Calvin was "not only not
   idle, but, as if he had been living in retirement, wrote most learned
   commentaries on six of Paul's Epistles." [193] The six Epistles
   referred to appear to have been the two Epistles to the Corinthians,
   and the Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and
   Colossians, Calvin's Commentary on the last four of these having been
   published, as appears from the dedication prefixed to it, in 1548.

   What is chiefly of importance to be observed, in connection with the
   respective dates of the Epistles above referred to, is the circumstance
   noticed by Beza -- that Calvin wrote his "most learned Commentaries" on
   those Epistles "as if he had been living in retirement," while in
   reality amidst scenes, which would have incapacitated any ordinary mind
   for such pursuits. In the careful study of these interesting portions
   of the Volume of Inspiration, Calvin's devout mind found refreshment
   amidst scenes of turmoil; and we cannot doubt, that while preparing,
   under circumstances like these, his Commentaries on the Epistles to the
   Corinthians, and most of Paul's other Epistles, he had ample experience
   of what he himself so beautifully expresses, when commenting on Psalm
   119:50,

   This is my comfort in my affliction, for thy word hath quickened me:

   "The Prophet... had good reason for stating, that in the time of
   affliction the faithful experience animation and vigour solely from the
   word of God inspiring them with life. Hence, if we meditate carefully
   on his word, we shall live even in the midst of death, nor will we meet
   with any sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a
   remedy. And if we are bereft of consolation and succour in our
   adversities, the blame must rest with ourselves; because, despising or
   overlooking the word of God, we purposely deceive ourselves with vain
   consolation." [194]

   [190] It is stated by Lemprière, in his Universal Dictionary, (Art.
   Wolmar Melchior,) that Wolmar "wrote Commentaries on the two first
   Books of the Iliad." Beza's meaning evidently is, that he did not
   publish any original work. -- Ed.

   [191] There is here, obviously, a play upon words, (common in that
   age,) founded on the coincidence between the names of Melior and
   Margaret with melior (Fr. meilleur) better, and margarita (Fr.
   marguerite) a pearl. -- Ed.

   [192] The original versions of the first and third Epigrams are given
   in Beza's "Poemata Varia," (Genevae, 1614,) p. 47, as follows: --
   "Melioris Volmarii, patria Rotvillensis, viri spectatiss. tum pietatis,
   tum doctrinae, praeceptoris perpetua memoria colendi, et Margaritae
   ipsius coniugis: uno eodemque die fato functorum, et eodem tumulo
   conditorum, Memoriae;" -- "To the memory of Melchior Wolmar, a native
   of Rotweil, a man most highly esteemed at once for piety and learning,
   an instructor to be ever kept in remembrance, and Margaret, his spouse,
   who died on one and the same day, and were buried in the same tomb"
   "Coniugii exemplum rarum, certumque beati
   Spectate cuncti coniuges:
   Una dies nobis Meliorem sustulit, una
   Et Margaritam sustulit:
   Sic uno quos vita thoro coniunxerat, uno
   Mors una tumulo condidit:
   Una ambos donec reddat lux unius olim
   Beatitatis compotes." "Quum tumulo lateat Melior Volmarius isto,
   Cui Margarita adest comes,
   Est illi cur inuideas Mausole, diuque
   Celebrata Pyramidum strues,
   Namque nihil melius Meliore, nec India quidquam
   Fert Margarita carius." In addition to the above, two Latin Epigrams by
   Beza, in honor of Wolmar, are to be found in his "Poemata Varia:" --
   "In Meliorem Volmarum praeceptorem summe observandum, doctissime
   Homerum in Academia Bituricensi interpretantem, anno Domini cloloXXXiv,
   quum ageret annum Beza 15 "Flacce, tibi quandoque bonus dormitat

   THE AUTHOR'S DEDICATORY EPISTLE.

   TO THAT MOST ACCOMPLISHED MAN,

   MELCHIOR WOLMAR RUFUS, LAWYER.

   JOHN CALVIN

   HEALTH.

   Should you be disposed to charge me, not merely with neglect, but even
   with incivility, for not having written to you for so long a time, I
   confess I have scarcely any apology to offer. For if I were to allege
   that the distance between us is so great, and that, during fully five
   years, I have met with no one that was going in your direction, this
   indeed were true, but it would be, I readily acknowledge, but a lame
   excuse. It appeared to me, accordingly, that I could not do better than
   offer to you some compensation, that might make up for the errors of
   the past, and might at once set me clear from all blame. Here, then,
   you have a commentary on the Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians,
   prepared by me with as much care as was in my power. [195] For I have
   no doubt that you will, in your kindness, accept of this as a
   sufficient compensation. At the same time there are other and weightier
   considerations, that have induced me to dedicate this to you.

   First of all, I remember with what fidelity [196] you cherished and
   strengthened the friendship, which had begun, (now long since,) in some
   small degree, to subsist between us -- how generously you were prepared
   to lay out yourself and your services on my account, when you thought
   that you had an opportunity presented to you of testifying your
   affection towards me; how carefully you made offer to me of your
   assistance [197] for my advancement, had not the calling in which I was
   at that time engaged prevented me from availing myself of it. Nothing,
   however, has had greater weight with me than the recollection of the
   first time I was sent by my father to learn civil law. Under your
   direction and tuition, I conjoined with the study of law Greek
   literature, of which you were at that time a most celebrated professor.
   And certainly it was not owing to you that I did not make greater
   proficiency; for, with your wonted kindness of disposition, you would
   have had no hesitation in lending me a helping hand for the completion
   of my course, had I not been called away by my father's death, when I
   had little more than started. I am, however, under no small obligations
   to you in this respect, that I was initiated by you in the rudiments,
   at least, which were afterwards of great advantage to me. Hence I could
   not satisfy myself without leaving to posterity some memorial of my
   gratitude, and at the same time rendering to you some fruit, such as it
   is, of your labor. [198] Farewell.

   Geneva, 1st August 1546.

   THE ARGUMENT

   ON THE

   SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS.

   So far as we can judge from the connection of this Epistle, it appears
   that the first Epistle was not without some good effect among the
   Corinthians, [199] but at the same time was not productive of so much
   benefit as it ought to have been; and farther, that some wicked
   persons, despising Paul's authority, persisted in their obstinacy. For
   the fact of his being so much occupied, at one time in declaring his
   fidelity, and at another in maintaining the dignity of his office, is
   itself a token that they had not as yet been thoroughly confirmed. He
   himself, too, complains in express terms, that there were some that
   made sport of his former Epistle, instead of deriving benefit from it.
   Understanding, then, the condition of the Church among them to be such,
   and being detained by other matters, so as to be prevented from coming
   to them so soon as he had at that time contemplated, he wrote this
   Epistle from Macedonia. We are now in possession of the purpose which
   he had in view in writing this Epistle -- that he might perfect what he
   had already begun, in order that he might, when he came, find every
   thing in proper order.

   He begins, as he is wont, with thanksgiving, rendering thanks to God,
   that he had been marvellously rescued from the most imminent dangers,
   and at the same time he calls them to notice, that all his afflictions
   and distresses tended to their benefit and welfare, that he may the
   better secure their favor by this farther pledge of union, [200] while
   the, wicked perversely took occasion from this to lessen his influence.
   Farther, when wishing to apologize for delaying to come to them, he
   declares that he had not changed his purpose from lightness or
   unsteadiness, and that he had not, for the purpose of deceiving,
   professed anything that he had not really had in view; [201] for there
   was the same consistency to be seen by them in all his sayings, that
   they had had experience of in his doctrine. Here, too, he briefly
   notices, how stable and sure was the truth of his preaching, as being
   founded on Christ, by whom all the promises of God are fixed and
   ratified -- which is a high recommendation of the gospel.

   After this he declares, that the reason why he had not come was this,
   that he could not appear among them cheerful and agreeable. In this
   statement, he reproves those, who, from his change of purpose, took
   occasion to calumniate him. He accordingly throws the blame upon the
   Corinthians, as being not yet well prepared for receiving him. He
   shows, at the same time, with what fatherly forbearance he was
   actuated, inasmuch as he kept himself back from visiting their city for
   this reason -- that he might not be under the necessity of exercising
   severity upon them.

   Farther, lest any one should object, that he had in the mean time not
   at all refrained from handling the Corinthians severely in his
   writings, he apologizes for the vehemence that he made use of in his
   first Epistle, by saying that it was owing to others -- they having
   shut him up to the necessity of this against his will. That this
   keenness had proceeded from a friendly disposition he satisfactorily
   shows, by ordering that the incestuous person himself, on whose account
   he had been much exasperated, should be received back into favor,
   having since that time given some evidence of repentance. Farther, he
   brings forward this additional evidence of his affection towards them,
   that he had no rest in his mind (2 Corinthians 2:13) until he had
   learned through means of Titus the state of their affairs, for an
   anxiety of this kind originates in affection.

   Having had occasion, however, to make mention here of his journey to
   Macedonia, he begins to speak of the glory of his ministry. As,
   however, those darling Apostles, who endeavored to detract from him,
   had obtained an easy victory over him by trumpeting their own praises,
   that he may have nothing in common with them, and that he may at the
   same time beat down their foolish boasting, he declares that he derives
   commendation from the work itself, [202] and does not borrow it from
   men. In the same passage, he extols in magnificent terms the efficacy
   of his preaching, and sets off to advantage the dignity of his
   Apostleship by comparing the gospel with the law, declaring, however,
   first of all, that he claimed nothing as his own, but acknowledged
   everything, whatever it might be, to have come forth from God.

   After this he relates again, with what fidelity and integrity he had
   discharged the office intrusted to him, and in this he reproves those
   who malignantly reproached him. Nay more, rising still higher in holy
   confidence, he declares, that all are blinded by the devil, who do not
   perceive the lustre of his gospel. Perceiving, however, that the
   meanness of his person (as being contemptible) [203] detracted much
   from the respect due to his Apostleship, embracing this favorable
   opportunity, he does not merely remove this occasion of offense, but
   turns it into an opposite direction, by saying, that the excellence of
   God's grace shines forth so much the more brightly, from the
   circumstance that so valuable a

   treasure was presented in earthen vessels.
   (2 Corinthians 4:7.)

   Thus he turns to his own commendation those things which the malevolent
   were wont to cast up to him by way of reproach, because on his being
   weighed down with so many distresses, he always, nevertheless, after
   the manner of the palm tree, [204] rises superior to them. He treats of
   this subject up to the middle of the fourth chapter, (2 Corinthians 4).
   As, however, the true glory of Christians lies beyond this world, he
   teaches that we must, by contempt of this present life and
   mortification of the outward man, set ourselves with the whole bent of
   our mind to meditation on a blessed immortality.

   Farther, near the beginning of the fifth chapter, (2 Corinthians 5), he
   glories in this -- that being actuated by such a disposition, he has
   nothing else as the object of his desire, than to have his services
   approved unto the Lord, and he entertains a hope, that he will have the
   Corinthians as witnesses of his sincerity. As, however, there was a
   danger of his being suspected of vanity, or arrogance, he again
   repeats, that he is constrained to this by the unreasonableness of
   wicked persons, and that it was not for his own sake, as though he were
   eager to retain their good opinion, but for the benefit of the
   Corinthians, to whom it was of advantage to have this opinion and
   persuasion; and he declares that he is concerned for nothing but their
   welfare. With the view of confirming this, he subjoins a universal
   statement, showing what ought to be the object aimed at by the servants
   of Christ -- that, losing sight of themselves, they should live to the
   honor of their Lord; and at length he concludes, that everything except
   newness of life ought to be reckoned of no importance, so that he
   alone, who has denied himself, is to be held in esteem. From this he
   passes on to unfold the sum of the Gospel message, that by the
   magnitude and excellence of it he may stir up both ministers and people
   to a pious solicitude. This he does in the beginning of the sixth
   chapter, (2 Corinthians 6).

   Here again, after having noticed how faithfully he discharged his
   office, he gently reproves the Corinthians, as being hinderances to
   themselves in the way of their reaping advantage. To this expostulation
   he immediately subjoins an exhortation, to flee from idolatry -- from
   which it appears, that the Corinthians had not yet been brought so far
   as he wished. Hence it is not without good reason that he complains,
   that they had themselves to blame, inasmuch as they had not had their
   ears open to doctrine so plain. But lest he should, by pressing too
   severely their tender minds, dishearten or alienate them, he again
   assures them of his kind disposition towards them, and resuming his
   apology for severity, which he had left off in a manner abruptly, he
   brings it to a conclusion, though in a different way. For assuming
   greater confidence, he acknowledges that he is not dissatisfied with
   himself for having grieved them, inasmuch as he had done it for their
   good; [205] while at the same time, by congratulating them on the happy
   issue, he shows them how cordially he desires their best interests.
   These things he treats of to the end of the seventh chapter, (2
   Corinthians 7).

   From the beginning of the eighth chapter, (2 Corinthians 8), to the end
   of the ninth, (2 Corinthians 9), he stirs them up to cheerfulness in
   giving alms, of which he had made mention in the last chapter of the
   first Epistle. He commends them, it is true, for having begun well, but
   lest the ardour of their zeal should cool in process of time, as often
   happens, he encourages them by a variety of arguments to go on
   perseveringly in the course on which they had entered.

   In the tenth chapter, (2 Corinthians 10), he begins to defend himself,
   and his office as an Apostle, from the calumnies with which the wicked
   assailed him. And in the first place, he shows that he is admirably
   equipped with the armor that is requisite for maintaining Christ's
   warfare. [206] Farther, he declares, that the authority which he had
   exercised in the former Epistle was grounded on the assurance of a good
   conscience, and he shows them that he had no less power in his actions,
   when present, than authority in his words when absent. Lastly, by
   instituting a comparison between himself and them, he shows how vain
   their boasting is. [207]

   In the eleventh chapter, (2 Corinthians 11), he calls upon the
   Corinthians to renounce those depraved inclinations, by which they had
   been corrupted, showing them that nothing is more dangerous than to
   allow themselves to be drawn aside from the simplicity of the Gospel.
   The fact of his having begun to be somewhat disesteemed among them,
   while others had been more favorably received by them, had arisen, as
   he shows, not from any fault on his part, but from their being haughty
   or nice to please; inasmuch as those others had brought them nothing
   better or more excellent, while he was contemptible in their view
   because he did not set himself off to advantage by elegance of speech,
   [208] or because he had, by voluntary subjection, by way of humouring
   their weakness, given up his just claim. This irony [209] contains in
   it an indirect reproach for their ingratitude, for where was the
   reasonableness of esteeming him the less, because he had accommodated
   himself to them? He declares, however, that the reason why he had
   refrained from taking the wages to which he was entitled, was not that
   he had less affection to the Corinthians, [210] but in order that no
   advantage might be gained over him in any respect by the false
   apostles, who, he saw, laid snares for him by this stratagem.

   Having reproved the unreasonable and malignant judgment of the
   Corinthians, he magnifies himself in a strain of pious glorying,
   letting them know in what magnificent terms he could boast, were he so
   inclined, premising however, that it is for their sakes that he acts
   the fool [211] in heralding his own praises. At length, checking
   himself, as it were, in the middle of the course, he says that his
   chief ground of glorying is that abasement which was despised by the
   proud, for he had been admonished by the Lord, not to glory in anything
   but in his infirmities.

   Towards the close of the twelfth chapter, (2 Corinthians 12), he again
   expostulates with them for shutting him up to the necessity of thus
   playing the fool, while they give themselves up to ambitious men, [212]
   by whom they are estranged from Christ. Farther, he inveighs keenly
   against those who wantonly raged against him, adding to their previous
   crimes this impudence of opposition. [213]

   In the thirteenth chapter, (2 Corinthians 13), by forewarning such
   persons, that he will treat them with peculiar severity, he exhorts all
   in general to recognise his apostleship, as it will be for their
   advantage to do so; while it is a dangerous thing for them to despise
   one, whom they had found by experience to be a trusty and faithful
   ambassador from the Lord.

   COMMENTARY ON THE
   SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 1:1-5

   1. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our
   brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the
   saints which are in all Achaia:

   1. Paulus Apostolus Iesu Christi per voluntatem Dei, et Timotheus
   frater, Ecclesiae Dei quae est Corinthi, cum sanctis omnibus qui sunt
   in tota Achaia:

   2. Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   2. Gratia vobis et pax a Deo Patre nostro, et Domino Iesu Christo.

   3. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
   of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

   3. Benedictus Deus, et Pater Domini nostri Iesu Christi, Pater
   misericordiarum, et Deus omnis consolationis,

   4. Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
   comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
   ourselves are comforted of God.

   4. Qui consolatur nos in omni tribulatione nostra, ut possimus
   consolari eos qui in omni tribulatione sunt, per consolationem qua
   consolatur nos Deus.

   5. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
   also aboundeth by Christ.

   5. Quia sicuti abundant passiones Christi in nos: ita per Christum
   abundat etiam consolatio nostra.


   1. Paul an Apostle As to the reasons why he designates himself an
   Apostle of Christ, and adds that he has obtained this honor by the will
   of God, see the foregoing Epistle, where it has been observed that none
   are to be listened to but those, who have been sent by God, and speak
   from his mouth, and that, consequently, to secure authority for any
   one, two things are required -- a call, and fidelity on the part of the
   person who is called, in the execution of his office. [214] Both of
   these Paul claims for himself. The false apostles, it is true, do the
   same; but then, by usurping a title that does not belong to them, they
   gain nothing among the sons of God, who can with the utmost ease
   convict them of impertinence. Hence the mere name is not enough, if
   there be not the reality along with it, so that he who gives himself
   out as an Apostle must also show himself to be such by his work.

   To the Church of God We must always keep it in view, his recognising a
   Church to exist, where there was such a conflux of evils. For the
   faults of individuals do not prevent a society that has genuine marks
   of religion [215] from being recognised as a Church. [216] But what
   does he mean by the expression -- with all saints? Were those saints
   unconnected with the Church? I answer, that this phrase refers to
   believers, who were dispersed hither and thither, throughout various
   corners of the province -- it being likely, that in that greatly
   disturbed period, when the enemies of Christ were everywhere venting
   their rage, many were scattered abroad, who could not conveniently hold
   sacred assemblies.

   3 Blessed be God He begins (as has been observed) with this
   thanksgiving -- partly for the purpose of extolling the goodness of God
   -- partly, with the view of animating the Corinthians by his example to
   the resolute endurance of persecutions; and partly, that he may magnify
   himself in a strain of pious glorying, in opposition to the malignant
   slanderings of the false apostles. For such is the depravity of the
   world, that it treats with derision martyrdoms, [217] which it ought to
   have held in admiration, and endeavours to find matter of reproach in
   the splendid trophies of the pious. [218] Blessed be God, says he. On
   what account? who comforteth us [219] -- the relative being used
   instead of the causal particle. [220] He had endured his tribulations
   with fortitude and alacrity: this fortitude he ascribes to God, because
   it was owing to support derived from his consolation that he had not
   fainted.

   He calls him the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and not without good
   reason, where blessings are treated of; for where Christ is not, there
   the beneficence of God is not. On the other hand, where Christ
   intervenes,

   by whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
   (Ephesians 3:15,)

   there are all mercies and all consolations of God -- nay, more, there
   is fatherly love, the fountain from which everything else flows.

   4. That we may be able to comfort There can be no doubt, that, as he
   had a little before cleared his afflictions from reproach and
   unfavorable reports, so now he instructs the Corinthians, that his
   having come off victorious through heavenly consolation was for their
   sake and with a view to their advantage, that they may stir themselves
   up to fellowship in suffering, instead of haughtily despising his
   conflicts. As, however, the Apostle lived not for himself but for the
   Church, so he reckoned, that whatever favors God conferred upon him,
   were not given for his own sake merely, [221] but in order that he
   might have more in his power for helping others. And, unquestionably,
   when the Lord confers upon us any favor, he in a manner invites us by
   his example to be generous to our neighbours. The riches of the Spirit,
   therefore, are not to be kept by us to ourselves, but every one must
   communicate to others what he has received. This, it is true, must be
   considered as being applicable chiefly to ministers of the Word. [222]
   It is, however, common to all, according to the measure of each. Thus
   Paul here acknowledges, that he had been sustained by the consolation
   of God, that he might be able himself to comfort others

   5. For as the sufferings of Christ abound -- This statement may be
   explained in two ways -- actively and passively. If you take it
   actively, the meaning will be this: "The more I am tried with various
   afflictions, so much the more resources have I for comforting others."
   I am, however, more inclined to take it in a passive sense, as meaning
   that God multiplied his consolations according to the measure of his
   tribulations. David also acknowledges that it had been thus with him:

   According to the multitude, says he, of my anxieties within me,
   thy consolations have delighted my soul. (Psalm 94:19.)

   In Paul's words, however, there is a fuller statement of doctrine; for
   the afflictions of the pious he calls the sufferings of Christ, as he
   says elsewhere,

   that he fills up in his body what is wanting in the
   sufferings of Christ. (Colossians 1:24.)

   The miseries and vexations, it is true, of the present life are common
   to good and bad alike, but when they befall the wicked, they are tokens
   of the curse of God, because they arise from sin, and nothing appears
   in them except the anger of God and participation with Adam, which
   cannot but depress the mind. But in the mean time believers are
   conformed to Christ, and

   bear about with them in their body his dying, that the life of Christ
   may one day be manifested in them. (2 Corinthians 4:10.)

   I speak of the afflictions which they endure for the testimony of
   Christ, (Revelation 1:9,) for although the Lord's chastisements, with
   which he chastises their sins, are beneficial to them, they are,
   nevertheless, not partakers, properly speaking, of Christ's sufferings,
   except in those cases in which they suffer on his account, as we find
   in 1 Peter 4:13. Paul's meaning then is, that God is always present
   with him in his tribulations, and that his infirmity is sustained by
   the consolations of Christ, so as to prevent him from being overwhelmed
   with calamities.

   2 Corinthians 1:6-11

   6. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
   salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
   which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
   consolation and salvation.

   6. Sive autem affligimur pro vestra consolatione et salute, [223] quae
   efficitur in tolerantia ipsarum passionum, quas et nos patimur: sive
   consolationem accipimus pro vestra consolatione et salute:

   7. And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
   of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

   7. Spes nostra firma est de vobis, [224] scientes, quod quemadmodum
   socii estis passionum, ita et consolationis.

   8. For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
   came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
   strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

   8. Nolo enim vos nescire, fratres, de tribulatione nostra, quae accidit
   nobis in Asia: nempe quod praeter modum gravati fuerimus supra vires,
   ita ut de vita quoque anxii essemus.

   9. But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not
   trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

   9. Quin etiam [225] ipsi in nobis ipsis sententiam mortis acceperamus:
   ne confideremus in nobis, sed in Deo, qui ad vitam suscitat mortuos:

   10. Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom
   we trust that he will yet deliver us;

   10. Qui ex tanta morte eripuit nos, et eripit, in quo spem fixam
   habemus, quod etiam posthaec eripiet;

   11. Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
   bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
   many on our behalf.

   11. Simul adiuvantibus et vobis per deprecationem pro nobis: ut donum,
   ex multis personis erga nos collatum, gratiarum actione per multos
   [226] celebretur pro nobis.


   6. Whether we are afflicted. From the circumstance that before the
   clause our hope of you is steadfast, there is introduced the connecting
   particle and, Erasmus has conceived the idea, that some word must be
   understood to correspond with those words -- for your consolation and
   salvation -- in this way, whether we are afflicted, IT IS for your
   consolation. I think it, however, more probable, that the connecting
   particle and is used here as meaning: Thus also, or in both cases. He
   had already stated, that he received consolation in order that he might
   communicate it to others. Now he goes a step farther, and says, that he
   has a steadfast hope, that they would be partakers of the consolation
   Besides, some of the most ancient Greek manuscripts introduce
   immediately after the first clause this statement -- and our hope of
   you is steadfast. [227] This reading removes all ambiguity. For when it
   is introduced in the middle, we must necessarily refer it to the latter
   clause, equally as to the former. At the same time, if any one wishes
   to have a complete sentence in each clause, by supplying some verb,
   there will be no great harm in this, and there will be no great
   difference as to the meaning. For if you read it as one continued
   statement, you must, at the same time, explain the different parts in
   this manner -- that the Apostle is afflicted, and is refreshed with
   consolation for the advantage of the Corinthians; and that he
   entertains, therefore, the hope, [228] that they will be at length
   partakers of the same consolation, with what is in reserve for himself.
   For my own part, I have adopted the way that I have judged the more
   suitable.

   It is, however, to be observed, that the word afflicted here refers not
   merely to outward misery, but also to that of the mind, so as to
   correspond with the opposite term comforted. (parakaleisthai ) Thus the
   meaning is, that the person's mind is pressed down with anxiety from a
   feeling of misery. [229] What we render consolation, is in the Greek
   paraklesis, -- a term which signifies also exhortation. If, however,
   you understand that kind of consolation, by which a person's mind is
   lightened of grief, and is raised above it, you will be in possession
   of Paul's meaning. For example, Paul himself would well-nigh have
   fallen down dead under the pressure of so many afflictions, had not God
   encouraged him, by raising him up by means of his consolation. Thus,
   too, the Corinthians derive strength and fortitude of mind from his
   sufferings, [230] while they take comfort from his example. Let us now
   sum up the whole matter briefly. As he saw that his afflictions were
   made by some an occasion of holding him in contempt, with the view of
   calling back the Corinthians from an error of this nature, [231] he
   shows in the first place that he ought to be in high esteem among them,
   in consideration of advantage redounding to themselves; and then
   afterwards he associates them with himself, that they may reckon his
   afflictions to be in a manner their own. "Whether I suffer afflictions,
   or experience consolation, it is all for your benefit, and I cherish an
   assured hope, that you will continue to enjoy this advantage." [232]

   For such were Paul's afflictions, and his consolations also, that they
   would have contributed to the edification of the Corinthians, had not
   the Corinthians of their own accord deprived themselves of the
   advantage redounding from it. He, accordingly, declares his confidence
   in the Corinthians to be such, that he entertains the assured hope that
   it will not be vain, that he has been afflicted, and has received
   consolation for their advantage. The false apostles made every effort
   to turn to Paul's reproach everything that befell him. Had they
   obtained their wish, the afflictions which he endured for their
   salvation, had been vain and fruitless; they would have derived no
   advantage from the consolations with which the Lord refreshed him. To
   contrivances of this nature he opposes his present confidence. His
   afflictions tended to promote the comfort of believers, as furnishing
   them with occasion of confirmation, on their perceiving that he
   suffered willingly, and endured with fortitude so many hardships for
   the sake of the gospel. For however we may acknowledge that afflictions
   ought to be endured by us for the sake of the gospel, we, nevertheless,
   tremble through a consciousness of our weakness, and think ourselves
   not prepared for it. [233] In that case, we should call to mind the
   examples of the saints, which should make us more courageous.

   On the other hand, his personal consolation flowed out to the whole
   Church, inasmuch as they concluded, [234] that God who had sustained
   and refreshed him in his emergency, would, in like manner, not be
   wanting to them. Thus their welfare was promoted in both ways, and this
   is what he introduces as it were by way of parenthesis, when he says --
   which is made effectual in the endurance, etc. For he wished to add
   this clause, by way of explanation, that they might not think that they
   had nothing to do with the afflictions which he alone endured. Erasmus
   takes the participle goumenes in an active sense, [235] but a passive
   signification is more suitable, [236] as Paul designed simply to
   explain in what respect everything that befell him was for their
   salvation. He says, accordingly, that he suffers, indeed, alone, but
   that his sufferings are of use for promoting their salvation -- not as
   though they were expiations or sacrifices for sins, but as edifying
   them by confirming them. Hence he conjoins consolation and salvation,
   with the view of pointing out the way in which their salvation was to
   be accomplished.

   7. Knowing, that as However there might be some of the Corinthians that
   were drawn away for the time by the calumnies of the false Apostles, so
   as to entertain less honorable views of Paul, on seeing him shamefully
   handled before the world, he, nevertheless, associates them with
   himself both in fellowship of afflictions, and in hope of consolation.
   [237] Thus he corrects their perverse and malignant view, without
   subjecting them to an open rebuke.

   8. For I would not have you ignorant He makes mention of the greatness
   and difficulty of his conflicts, that the glory of victory may thereby
   the more abundantly appear. Since the time of his sending them the
   former epistle, he had been exposed to great dangers, and had endured
   violent assaults. The probability, however, is that he refers here to
   the history, which Luke relates in Acts 19:23, though in that passage
   he does not so distinctly intimate the extent of the danger. As,
   however, he states that the whole city was in a tumult, (Acts 19:29,)
   it is easy from this to infer the rest. For we know what is the usual
   effect of a popular tumult, when it has been once kindled. By this
   persecution Paul declares he had been oppressed beyond measure, nay
   more, above strength, that is, so as not to be able to endure the
   burden. For it is a metaphor taken from persons who give way under the
   pressure of a heavy load, or from ships that sink from being overladen
   -- not that he had actually fainted, but that he felt that his strength
   would have failed him, if the Lord had not imparted fresh strength.
   [238]

   So that we were in anxiety even as to life itself -- that is, "So that
   I thought life was gone, or at least I had very little hope of it
   remaining, as those are wont to feel who are shut up so as to see no
   way of escape." Was then so valiant a soldier of Christ, so brave a
   wrestler, left without strength, so as to look for nothing but death?
   [239] For he mentions it as the reason of what he had stated -- that he
   despaired of life. I have already observed, that Paul does not measure
   his strength in connection with help from God, but according to his own
   personal feeling of his ability. Now there can be no doubt, that all
   human strength must give way before the fear of death. Farther, it is
   necessary that even saints themselves should be in danger of an entire
   failure of strength, that, being put in mind of their own weakness,
   they may learn, agreeably to what follows, to place their entire
   dependence on God alone. At the same time I have preferred to explain
   the word exaporeisthai, which is made use of by Paul, as denoting a
   trembling anxiety, rather than render it, as Erasmus has done by the
   word despair; because he simply means, that he was hemmed in by the
   greatest difficulties, so that no means of preserving life seemed to
   remain. [240]

   9. Nay more, we had the sentence of death This is as though we should
   say -- "I had already laid my account with dying, or had regarded it as
   a thing fixed." He borrows, however, a similitude from those who are
   under sentence of death, and look for nothing but the hour when they
   are to die. At the same time he says, that this sentence had been
   pronounced by him upon himself, by which he intimates, that it was in
   his own view that he had been sentenced to death -- that he might not
   seem to have had it from any revelation from God. In this sentence,
   [241] therefore, there is something more implied than in the feeling of
   anxiety (exaporeisthai) that he had made mention of, because in the
   former case there was despair of life, but in this case there is
   certain death. We must, however, take notice, chiefly, of what he adds
   as to the design -- that he had been reduced to this extremity, that he
   might not trust in himself For I do not agree with what Chrysostom says
   -- that the Apostle did not stand in need of such a remedy, but set
   himself forth to others as a pattern merely in appearance. [242] For he
   was a man that was subject, in other respects, to like passions as
   other men -- (James 5:17) -- not merely to cold and heat, but also to
   misdirected confidence, rashness, and the like. I do not say that he
   was addicted to these vices, but this I say, that he was capable of
   being tempted to them, and that this was the remedy that God seasonably
   interposed, that they might not make their way into his mind. [243]

   There are, accordingly, two things to be observed here. In the first
   place -- that the fleshly confidence with which we are puffed up, is so
   obstinate, that it cannot be overthrown in any other way than by our
   falling into utter despair. [244] For as the flesh is proud, it does
   not willingly give way, and never ceases to be insolent until it has
   been constrained; nor are we brought to true submission, until we have
   been brought down by the mighty hand of God. (1 Peter 5:6.) Secondly,
   it is to be observed, that the saints themselves have some remains of
   this disease adhering to them, and that for this reason they are often
   reduced to an extremity, that, stript of all self-confidence, they may
   learn humility: nay more, that this malady is so deeply rooted in the
   minds of men, that even the most advanced are not thoroughly purged
   from it, until God sets death before their eyes. And hence we may
   infer, how displeasing to God confidence in ourselves must be, when for
   the purpose of correcting it, it is necessary that we should be
   condemned to death.

   But in God that raiseth the dead As we must first die, [245] in order
   that, renouncing confidence in ourselves, and conscious of our own
   weakness, we may claim no honor to ourselves, so even that were not
   sufficient, if we did not proceed a step farther. Let us begin,
   therefore, with despairing of ourselves, but with the view of placing
   our hope in God. Let us be brought low in ourselves, but in order that
   we may be raised up by his power. Paul, accordingly, having brought to
   nothing the pride of the flesh, immediately substitutes in its place a
   confidence that rests upon God. Not in ourselves, says he, but in God

   The epithet that follows, Paul has adapted to the connection of the
   subject, as he does in Romans 4:17, where he speaks of Abraham. For to

   believe in God, who calleth those things that are not, as though they
   were, and to hope in God who raiseth the dead,

   are equivalent to his setting before him as an object of contemplation,
   the power of God in creating his elect out of nothing, and raising up
   the dead. Hence Paul says, that death had been set before his eyes,
   that he might, in consequence of this, recognize the more distinctly
   the power of God, by which he had been raised up from the dead. The
   first thing in order, it is true, is this -- that, by means of the
   strength with which God furnishes us, we should acknowledge him as the
   Author of life; but as in consequence of our dulness the light of life
   often dazzles our eyes, it is necessary that we should be brought to
   God by having death presented to our view. [246]

   10. Who hath delivered us from so great a death Here he applies to
   himself personally, what he had stated in a general way, and by way of
   proclaiming the grace of God, he declares that he had not been
   disappointed in his expectation, inasmuch as he had been delivered from
   death, and that too, in no common form. As to his manner of expression,
   the hyperbole, which he makes use of, is not unusual in the Scriptures,
   for it frequently occurs, both in the Prophets and in the Psalms, and
   it is made use of even in common conversation. What Paul acknowledges
   as to himself personally, let every one now take home as applicable to
   himself.

   In whom we have an assured hope. He promises himself as to the future,
   also, that beneficence of God, which he had often experienced in the
   past. Nor is it without good reason; for the Lord, by accomplishing in
   part what he has promised, bids us hope well as to what remains. Nay
   more, in proportion to the number of favors that we receive from him,
   does he by so many pledges, or earnests, as it were, confirm his
   promises. [247] Now, although Paul had no doubt that God would of his
   own accord be present with him, yet he exhorts the Corinthians to
   commend to God in their prayers his safety. For when he assumes it as
   certain, that he will be aided by them, this declaration has the force
   of an exhortation, and he means that they would not merely do it as a
   matter of duty, but also with advantage. [248]

   "Your prayers, also," he says, "will help me." [249] For God wills not
   that the duty of mutual intercession, which he enjoins upon us, should
   be without advantage. This ought to be a stimulus to us, on the one
   hand, to solicit the intercession of our brethren, when we are weighed
   down by any necessity, and, on the other, to render similar assistance
   in return, since we are informed, that it is not only a duty that is
   well pleasing to God, but also profitable to ourselves. Nor is it owing
   to distrust that the Apostle implores the friendly aid of his brethren,
   [250] for, while he felt assured, that his safety would be the object
   of God's care, [251] though he were destitute of all human help, yet he
   knew that it was well pleasing to God, that he should be aided by the
   prayers of the saints. He had respect, also, to the promises that were
   given, that assistance of this kind would not be in vain. Hence, in
   order that he might not overlook any assistance that was appointed to
   him by God, he desired that the brethren should pray for his
   preservation.

   The sum is this -- that we follow the word of God, that is, that we
   obey his commandments and cleave to his promises. This is not the part
   of those who have recourse to the assistance of the dead; [252] for not
   contented with the sources of help appointed by God, they call in to
   their aid a new one, that has no countenance from any declaration of
   Scripture. For whatever we find mentioned there as to mutual
   intercession, has no reference to the dead, but is expressly restricted
   to the living. Hence Papists act childishly in perverting those
   passages, so as to give some colour to their superstition. [253]

   11. That the gift bestowed upon us through means of many persons. As
   there is some difficulty in Paul's words, interpreters differ as to the
   meaning. I shall not spend time in setting aside the interpretations of
   others, nor indeed is there any need for this, provided only we are
   satisfied as to the true and proper meaning. He had said, that the
   prayers of the Corinthians would be an assistance to him. He now adds a
   second advantage that would accrue from it -- a higher manifestation of
   God's glory. "For whatever God will confer upon me," says he, "being as
   it were obtained through means of many persons, will, also, by many be
   celebrated with praises:" or in this way -- "Many will give thanks to
   God in my behalf, because, in affording help to me, he has favorably
   regarded the prayers, not merely of one but of many." In the first
   place, while it is our duty to allow no favor from God to pass without
   rendering praise, it becomes us, nevertheless, more especially when our
   prayers have been favorably regarded by him, to acknowledge his mercy
   with thanksgiving, as he commands us to do in Psalm 50:15. Nor ought
   this to be merely where our own personal interest is concerned, but
   also where the welfare of the Church in general, or that of any one of
   our brethren is involved. Hence when we mutually pray one for another,
   and obtain our desire, the glory of God is so much the more set forth,
   inasmuch as we all acknowledge, with thanksgiving, God's benefits --
   both those that are conferred publicly upon the whole Church, and also
   those that are bestowed privately upon individuals.

   In this interpretation there is nothing forced; for as to the
   circumstance that in the Greek the article being introduced between the
   two clauses by many persons, and the gift conferred upon me appears to
   disjoin them, [254] that has no force, as it is frequently found
   introduced between clauses that are connected with each other. Here,
   however, it is with propriety introduced in place of an adversative
   particle; [255] for although it had come forth from many persons, it
   was nevertheless peculiar to Paul. To take the phrase dia pollon (by
   means of many) in the neuter gender, [256] as some do, is at variance
   with the connection of the passage.

   It may, however, be asked, why he says From many persons, rather than
   From many men, and what is the meaning of the term person here? I
   answer, it is as though he had said -- With respect to many. For the
   favor was conferred upon Paul in such a way, that it might be given to
   many. Hence, as God had respect to many, he says on that account, that
   many persons were the cause of it. Some Greek manuscripts have huper
   humon -- on your account; and although this appears to be at variance
   with Paul's design, and the connection of the words, it may,
   nevertheless, be explained with propriety in this manner: "When God
   shall have heard you in behalf of my welfare, and that too for your own
   welfare, thanks will be given by many on your account."

   weak." -- Ed.

   [236] Dr. Bloomfield, in his Notes on 1 Thessalonians 2:13, explains
   energeitai, to mean -- "is made effectual," or "shews itself in its
   effects," and adds: "This view I find supported by the opinion of
   Schott, who maintains that energeisthai, is never in the New Testament
   used as a middle form, with an active sense; but always (especially in
   St. Paul's writings) as a passive. Indeed, Bp. Bull, Exam. p. 9, goes
   yet farther, and asserts, that it is scarcely ever so used, even in the
   Classical writers (I believe he might have said never) but always in a
   passive sense." -- Ed.

   [237] The Corinthians were koinonoi partakers of, or in communion with
   him in his afflictions. What is more humble and lowly (ti
   tapeinophronesteron) than Paul in this expression? saith Chrysostom --
   they who had not in the least measure shared with him in sufferings,
   yet he maketh them copartners with him. They are, as Salmeron
   expresseth it, Copartners in the gain and in the loss with Paul. They
   venture (as it were) in the ship together." -- Burgesse. -- Ed.

   [238] "Pressed above measure. (kath ' huperbolen ebaresthemen.) The
   words baros and baroumai, are applied sometimes to the enduring of a
   burden, (Matthew 20:12; Galatians 6:2,) whether it be a temporal burden
   or spiritual [...] In this place it seemeth to be taken from porters,
   who have a burden imposed upon them, more than they are able to stand
   under; or as Chrysostom, from ships which are over much burdened, and
   so are in danger of being lost. And as if there were not emphasis
   enough in the word pressed, he addeth another to aggravate it -- (kath
   ' huperbolen) -- above measure -- Above strength. (huper dunamin.)
   Chrysostom observeth this differeth from the other. For a burden may be
   exceeding heavy, yet to some mighty man it may not be above his
   strength. When Samson (Judges 16:3) carried away the gates of the city
   Gaza, with the posts and barre upon his shoulders, here was a burden
   out of measure heavy; no ordinary man could do so; but yet to Samson it
   was not above his strength. Thus it was with Paul, who may be called a
   spiritual Samson, for that heavenly might and power which God had
   endowed him with; he is assaulted with a trouble that was not only
   hyperbolically weighty, but also above his strength. Paul had no more
   power to stand under it." -- Burgesse on 2 Corinthians 1, pp. 269, 270,

   knowing how to proceed. -- In Psalm 88:8, where David says -- I am shut
   up, and I cannot come forth, the Hebrew words vl' 'ts'(velo etse,) are
   rendered in the Septuagint -- kai ouk exeporeuomen -- and I could not
   come forth. It is worthy of notice that, in the metre version, the idea
   expressed by Calvin, as implied in the verb exaporeisthai, is fully
   brought out -- "find no evasion for me." -- Ed.

   [241] "The Greek word is aposkrima, used here in this place only in the
   New Testament. [...] The most genuine translation is sentence; for so
   Hesychius expounds the word katakrisma -- psopho", whom Favorinus
   followeth verbatim in this, as in many other particulars. [...] The
   word then doth signifie a sentence passing upon him, that he must die.
   This he had received, but from whom? Not from God, for God delivered
   him; nor from the magistrate; there was no such decree that we read of
   against him. Therefore it was onely from his own feares, his own
   thoughts, which maketh him say -- he had received it in himself. [...]
   God's thoughts were other than Paul's. Paul absolutely concluded he
   should die, but God had purposed the contrary." -- Burgesse. -- Ed.

   [242] "Il se propose aux autres comme pour exemple, non pas qu'il en
   fust ainsi quant à luy;" -- "He sets himself forth, as it were by way
   of example -- not that it had been so as to himself."

   "It is necessary, in order that we may be brought back to God, that we
   should be brought to such an extremity, that we see death presented
   before our eyes."

   [247] Granville Penn reads the passage as follows: "Who hath delivered
   us from so great a death; and will deliver us: in whom we hope that he
   will deliver us." -- "The Vat. and Ephrem MSS." he observes, "read
   rhu'setai, not rhu'etai, as in the rec. text. The latter reading seems
   to have been substituted, because rhu'setai, occurs again in the
   following sentence; but the Apostle repeats the word, that he may
   qualify it by elpikamen, (we hope.") -- Ed.

   [248] "Mais aussi auec bonne issue, d'autant qu'ils seront exaucez;" --
   "But also with good success, inasmuch as they will be heard."

   [249] "L'aide, dit il, que vous me feriez par vos prieres, ne sera

   your prayers, will not be without advantage."

   [250] "You also helping together by prayer for us, (Sunupourgounton kai
   humon huper hemon tho deesei.) The particle kai is emphatical, You also
   -- implying, that neither God's promise, nor his power, would procure
   this mercy alone without their prayer. Besides the goodness of God on
   his part, there must be prayer on their part. The word in the original
   for helping is emphatical, being twice compounded. upourgounton doth
   denote the service and ministry of those who are under us; and so it
   doth imply, that the Church doth owe as a debt unto their spiritual
   guides earnest prayer for them. [...] Then there is the preposition sun
   added, which doth denote not only their effectual prayers, but their
   concord and agreement therein, and that in their public and solemn
   assemblies. Again, the word signifying -- to work, and labor, doth
   denote what the nature of prayer is -- that the soul labors therein, is
   fervent, full of agonies; which showeth that the customary formal
   prayers of most people are not worthy of the name: there is no labor,
   or fervency of the soul therein. -- They labored by prayer. They did
   not labor by using friends to solicit the magistrate in Paul's behalf,
   for there was no hope from them, but they made their addresses to God."
   -- Burgesse. -- Ed.

   2 Corinthians 1:12-14

   12. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
   simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the
   grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more
   abundantly to you-ward.

   12. Nam gloriatio nostra haec est: testimonium conscientiae nostrae,
   quod in simplicitate et puritate [257] Dei, non in sapientia carnali,
   sed in gratia Dei versati sumus in mundo; abundantius autem erga vos.

   13. For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
   acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

   13. Non enim alia scribimus vobis quam quae recognoscitis vel etiam
   agnoscitis: spero autem, quod usque in finem agnoscetis:

   14. As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
   rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.

   14. Quemadmodum et agnovistis nos ex parte: siquidem gloriatio vestra
   sumus: sicuti et vos nostra in die Domini Iesu.


   12. For our glorying is this. He assigns a reason why his preservation
   should be a subject of interest to all -- that he had conducted himself
   [258] among them all in simplicity and sincerity He deserved,
   therefore, to be dear to them, and it would have been very unfeeling
   not to be concerned in reference to such a servant of the Lord, that he
   might be long preserved for the benefit of the Church. "I have
   conducted myself before all in such a manner, that it is no wonder if I
   have the approbation and love of all good men." He takes occasion from
   this, however, for the sake of those to whom he was writing, to make a
   digression for the purpose of declaring his own integrity. As, however,
   it is not enough to be approved of by man's judgment, and as Paul
   himself was harassed by the unjust and malignant judgments of some, or
   rather by corrupt and blind attachments, [259] he adduces his own
   conscience as his witness -- which is all one as though he had cited
   God as a witness, or had made what he says matter of appeal to his
   tribunal.

   But how does Paul's glorying in his integrity comport with that
   statement,

   He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord?
   (2 Corinthians 10:17.)

   Besides, who is so upright [260] as to dare to boast in the presence of
   God? In the first place, Paul does not oppose himself to God, as though
   he had anything that was his own, or that was from himself. Farther, he
   does not place the foundation of his salvation in that integrity to
   which he lays claim, nor does he make confidence in that the ground of
   his dependence. Lastly, he does not glory in God's gifts in such a way
   as not at the same time to render all the glory to him as their sole
   Author, and ascribe everything to him. [261] These three exceptions lay
   a foundation for every godly person glorying on good grounds in all
   God's benefits; while the wicked, on the other hand, cannot glory even
   in God, except on false and improper grounds. Let us therefore, first
   of all, acknowledge ourselves to be indebted to God for everything good
   that we possess, claiming no merit to ourselves. Secondly, let us hold
   fast this foundation -- that our dependence for salvation be grounded
   exclusively on the mercy of God. Lastly, let us repose ourselves [262]
   in the sole author of every blessing. Then in that there will be a
   pious [263] glorying in every kind of blessing.

   That in the simplicity [264] of God. He employs the expression
   simplicity of God here, in the same way as in Romans 3:23, the glory of
   God; and in John 12:43, the glory of God and of men. Those who love the
   glory of men, wish to appear something before men, or to stand well in
   the opinion of men. The glory of God is what a man has in the sight of
   God. Hence Paul does not reckon it enough to declare that his sincerity
   was perceived by men, but adds, that he was such in the sight of God.
   Eilikrineia (which I have rendered purity) is closely connected with
   simplicity; for it is an open and upright way of acting, such as makes
   a man's heart as it were transparent. [265] Both terms stand opposed to
   craft, deception, and all underhand schemes.

   Not in fleshly wisdom. There is here a sort of anticipation; for what
   might be felt to be wanting in him he readily acknowledges, nay more,
   he openly proclaims, that he is destitute of, but adds, that he is
   endowed with what is incomparably more excellent -- the grace of God "I
   acknowledge," says he, "that I am destitute of fleshly wisdom, but I
   have been furnished with divine influence, and if any one is not
   satisfied with that, he is at liberty to depreciate my Apostleship. If,
   on the other hand, fleshly wisdom is of no value, then I want nothing
   that is not fitted to secure well-grounded praise." He gives the name
   of fleshly wisdom to everything apart from Christ, that procures for us
   the reputation of wisdom. See the first and second chapters of the
   former epistle. Hence, by the grace of God, which is contrasted with
   it, we must understand everything that transcends man's nature and
   capacity, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which openly manifested the
   power of God in the weakness of the flesh.

   More abundantly towards you Not that he had been less upright
   elsewhere, but that he had remained longer at Corinth, in order that he
   might (not to mention other purposes) afford a fuller and clearer proof
   of his integrity. He has, however, expressed himself intentionally in
   such a way as to intimate that he did not require evidences that were
   far-fetched, inasmuch as they were themselves the best witnesses of all
   that he had said.

   13. For we write no other things Here he indirectly reproves the false
   apostles, who recommended themselves by immoderate boastings, while
   they had little or no ground for it; and at the same time he obviates
   calumnies, in order that no one may object, that he claims for himself
   more than is his due. He says, therefore, that he does not in words
   boast of anything that he is not prepared to make good by deeds, and
   that, too, from the testimony of the Corinthians.

   The ambiguity, however, of the words, has given occasion for this
   passage being misinterpreted. Anaginoskein, among the Greeks, signifies
   sometimes to read, and at other times to recognize. Epiginoskein
   sometimes signifies to discover, while at other times it means what the
   Latins properly express by the verb agnoscere, to own, as among lawyers
   the phrase is used to own a child, [266] as Budaeus also has observed.
   In this way epiginoskein means more than anaginoskein For we say that a
   person recognises a thing, that is, that being silently convinced of it
   in his judgment, he perceives it to be true, while at the same time he
   does not acknowledge it, or, in other words, cordially intimate his
   assent to it.

   Let us now examine Paul's words. Some read thus -- We write no other
   things than what ye read and acknowledge, which it is very manifest is
   exceedingly lifeless, not to say senseless. For as to Ambrose's
   qualifying the statement in this way -- You not only read, but also
   acknowledge, there is no one that does not perceive that it is quite
   foreign to the import of the words. And the meaning that I have stated
   is plain, and hangs together naturally, and, up to this point, there is
   nothing to prevent readers from understanding it, were it not that they
   have had their eyes shut, from being misled by the different meanings
   of the word. The sum is this -- that Paul declares, that he brings
   forward no other things than what were known and perceived by the
   Corinthians -- nay more, things as to which they would bear him
   witness. The first term employed is recognoscere, (to recognize,) which
   is applicable, when persons are convinced from experience that matters
   are so. The second is agnoscere, (to acknowledge,) meaning that they
   give their assent to the truth. [267]

   And, I hope, will acknowledge even to the end. As the Corinthians had
   not yet perfectly returned to a sound mind, so as to be prepared to
   weigh his fidelity in a just and even balance, [268] but at the same
   time had begun to abate somewhat of their perverse and malignant
   judgment respecting him, he intimates, that he hopes better as to the
   future. "You have already," says he, "to some extent acknowledged me. I
   hope that you will acknowledge more and more what I have been among
   you, and in what manner I have conducted myself." [269] From this it
   appears more clearly what he meant by the word epiginoskein.
   (acknowledge [270] ) Now this relates to a season of repentance, for
   they had at the beginning acknowledged him fully and thoroughly;
   afterwards their right judgment had been beclouded [271] by unfair
   statements, but they had at length begun to return in part to a sound
   mind.

   14. For we are your glorying. We have briefly adverted to the manner in
   which it is allowable for saints to glory in God's benefits -- when
   they repose themselves in God alone, and have no other object of aim.
   Thus it was a ground of pious glorying on the part of Paul, that he
   had, by his ministry, brought the Corinthians under obedience to
   Christ; and of the Corinthians, on the other hand, that they had been
   trained up so faithfully and so virtuously by such an Apostle -- a
   privilege that had not been allotted to all. This way of glorying in
   men does not stand in the way of our glorying in God alone. Now he
   instructs the Corinthians, that it is of the greatest importance for
   themselves that they should acknowledge him to be a faithful, and not a
   merely pretended, servant of Christ; because, in the event of their
   withdrawing from him, they would deprive themselves of the highest
   glory. In these words he reproves their fickleness, inasmuch as they
   voluntarily deprived themselves of the highest glory, by listening too
   readily to the spiteful and envious.

   In the day of the Lord By this I understand the last day, which will
   put an end to all the fleeting [272] glories of this world. He means,
   then, that the glorying of which he is now speaking is not evanescent,
   as those things are that glitter in the eyes of men, but is abiding and
   stable, inasmuch as it will remain until the day of Christ. For then
   will Paul enjoy the triumph of the many victories that he had obtained
   under Christ's auspices, and will lead forth in splendor all the
   nations that have, by means of his ministry, been brought under
   Christ's glorious yoke; and the Church of the Corinthians will glory in
   having been founded and trained up by the services of so distinguished
   an Apostle.

   17. Hoc igitur quum animo propositum haberem, nuncubi levitate usus
   sum? aut quae cogito, secundum carnem cogito? ut sit apud me Etiam,
   etiam: et Non, non.

   18. But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

   18. Fidelis Deus, quod sermo noster apud vos non fuit Etiam et non.

   19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us,
   even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him
   was yea.

   19. Dei enim Filius Iesus Christus in vobis per nos praedicatus, per
   me, et Silvanum, et Timotheum, non fuit Etiam et non: sed Etiam fuit in
   ipso.

   20. For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
   the glory of God by us.

   20. Quaecunque enim sunt Dei promissiones, in illo sunt Etiam: quare et
   per ipsum sit Amen Deo ad gloriam per nos.


   15. In this confidence. After having given them reason to expect that
   he would come, he had subsequently changed his intention. This was made
   an occasion of calumny against him, as appears from the excuse that he
   brings forward. When he says that it was from relying on this
   confidence that he formed the purpose of coming to them, he indirectly
   throws the blame upon the Corinthians, inasmuch as they had, by their
   ingratitude, hindered, to some extent, his coming to them, by depriving
   him of that confidence.

   That ye might have a second benefit The first benefit had been this --
   that he had devoted himself for the entire period of a year and six
   months (Acts 18:11) to the work of gaining them to the Lord; the second
   was their being confirmed, by means of his coming to them, in the faith
   which they had once received, and being stirred up by his sacred
   admonitions to make farther progress. Of this latter benefit the
   Corinthians had deprived themselves, inasmuch as they had not allowed
   the apostle to come to them. They were paying, therefore, the penalty
   of their own fault, and they had no ground for imputing any blame to
   Paul. If any one, however, prefers, with Chrysostom, to take charin
   (benefit) as used instead of karan, (joy,) I do not much object to it.
   [275] The former interpretation, however, is more simple.

   17. Did I use fickleness? There are two things, more especially, that
   prevent the purposes of men from being carried into effect, or their
   promises from being faithfully performed. The one is that they make
   changes upon them almost every hour, and the other is that they are too
   rash in forming their plans. It is a sign of changeableness to purpose
   or promise what you almost immediately afterwards regret. With that
   fault Paul declares he had not been chargeable. "I have not," says he,
   "through fickleness drawn back from the promise that I made." He
   declares also that he had been on his guard against rashness and
   misdirected confidence; for such is the way in which I explain the
   expression -- purpose according to the flesh For it is, as I have
   stated, the common practice of men, as though they were not dependent
   on God's providence, and were not subject to his will, to determine
   rashly and presumptuously what they will do. Now God, with the view of
   punishing this presumption, defeats their plans, so as to prevent them
   from having a prosperous issue, and in many instances holds up
   themselves to ridicule.

   The expression, it is true, according to the flesh, might be extended
   farther, so as to include all wicked schemes, and such as are not
   directed to a right end, as for example such as are dictated by
   ambition, avarice, or any other depraved affection. Paul, however, in
   my opinion, did not intend here to refer to any thing of that nature,
   but merely to reprove that rashness which is but too customary on the
   part of man, and in daily use in the forming of plans. To purpose,
   therefore, according to the flesh, is not owning God as our ruler, but,
   instead of this, being impelled by a rash presumption, which is
   afterwards justly derided by God, and punished. The apostle, with the
   view of clearing himself from these faults, proposes a question, as if
   in the person of his opponents. Hence it is probable, as I have already
   said, that some unfavorable report had been put in circulation by
   wicked persons.

   That with me there should be yea, yea Some connect this statement with
   what goes before, and explain it thus: "As if it were in my power to
   perform whatever I purpose, as men determine that they will do whatever
   comes into their mind, and order their ways, as Solomon speaks,
   (Proverbs 16:1,) while they cannot so much as govern their tongue."
   And, undoubtedly, the words seem to imply this much -- that what has
   been once affirmed must remain fixed, and what has been once denied
   must never be done. So James in his Epistle (James 5:12) says,

   Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, lest ye fall into dissimulation.

   Farther, the context would in this way suit exceedingly well as to what
   goes before. For to purpose according to the flesh is this -- when we
   wish that, without any exception, our determinations shall be like
   oracles. [276] This interpretation, However, does not accord with what
   immediately follows -- God is faithful, etc., where Paul makes use of
   the same form of expression, when he has it in view to intimate, that
   he had not been unfaithful in his preaching. Now it were absurd, if
   almost in the same verse he reckoned it as a fault that his yea should
   be yea, and his nay nay, and yet at the same time laid claim to it as
   his highest praise. I am aware of what could be said in reply, if any
   one were disposed to sport himself with subtleties, but I have no
   relish for anything that is not solid.

   I have, therefore, no doubt, that in these words Paul designed to
   reprove fickleness, although they may seem to be susceptible of another
   meaning, for the purpose of clearing himself from that calumny -- that
   he was accustomed to promise in words what he failed to perform in
   deeds. [277] Thus the reiterating of the affirmation and negation will
   not have the same meaning as in Matthew 5:37 and in James, but will
   bear this meaning -- "that yea should with me be in this instance yea,
   and on the other hand, when it pleases me, nay, nay " At the same time
   it is possible that it may have crept in through the ignorance of
   transcribers, as the old translation does not redouble the words, [278]
   However this may be, we ought not to be very solicitous as to the
   words, provided we are in possession of the apostle's intention, which,
   as I have said, clearly appears from what follows. [279]

   18. God is faithful. By the term word he means doctrine, as is manifest
   from the reason that he adds, when he says, that the Son of God, who is
   preached by him, is not variable, etc. As to his being always
   consistent with himself in point of doctrine, and not differing from
   himself, [280] he intends that by this they shall form a judgment as to
   his integrity, and in this way he removes every unfavorable suspicion
   of fickleness or unfaithfulness. It does not, however, necessarily
   follow, that the man who is faithful in doctrine, is also observant of
   truth in all his words. But as Paul did not reckon it of much
   importance in what estimation he was held, provided only the majesty of
   his doctrine remained safe and sound, he, on that account, calls the
   attention of the Corinthians chiefly to that matter. He intimates, it
   is true, that he observed in his whole life the same course of
   fidelity, as the Corinthians had seen in his ministry. He seems,
   however, as if intentionally, in repelling the calumny, to transfer it
   from his person to his doctrine, because he was unwilling that his
   apostleship should be indirectly defamed, while he was not greatly
   concerned as to himself in other respects.

   But observe, with what zeal he applies himself to this. For he calls
   God to witness, how simple and pure his preaching was -- not ambiguous,
   not variable, not temporizing. In his oath, too, he connects the truth
   of God with the truth of his doctrine. "The truth of my preaching is as
   sure and stable as God is faithful and true." Nor is this to be
   wondered at, for the word of God, which Isaiah says endureth for ever,
   (Isaiah 40:8,) is no other than what prophets and apostles published to
   the world, as Peter explains it. (1 Peter 1:25.) Hence, too, his
   confidence [281] in denouncing a curse upon angels, if they dared to
   bring another gospel, one that was at variance with his. (Galatians
   1:8.) Who would dare to make the angels of heaven subject to his
   doctrine, if he had not God as his authority and defense? With such an
   assurance of a good conscience does it become ministers [282] to be
   endowed, who mount the pulpit to speak the word in Christ's name -- so
   as to feel assured that their doctrine can no more be overthrown than
   God himself.

   19. For the Son of God Here we have the proof -- because his preaching
   [283] contained nothing but Christ alone, who is the eternal and
   immutable truth of God. The clause preached by us is emphatic. For, as
   it may be, and often does happen, that Christ is disfigured by the
   inventions [284] of men, and is adulterated, as it were, by their
   disguises, he declares that it had not been so as to himself or his
   associates, but that he had sincerely and with an integrity that was
   befitting, held forth Christ pure and undisguised. Why it is that he
   makes no mention of Apollos, while he mentions by name Timotheus and
   Silvanus, does not exactly appear; unless the reason be, as is
   probable, that the more that individuals were assailed by the calumnies
   of the wicked, [285] he was so much the more careful to defend them.

   In these words, however, he intimates that his whole doctrine was
   summed up in a simple acquaintance with Christ alone, as in reality the
   whole of the gospel is included in it. Hence those go beyond due
   limits, who teach anything else than Christ alone, with whatever show
   of wisdom they may otherwise be puffed up. For as he is the end of the
   law, (Romans 10:4,) so he is the head -- the sum -- in fine, the
   consummation -- of all spiritual doctrine.

   In the second place, he intimates that his doctrine respecting Christ
   had not been variable, or ambiguous, so as to present him from time to
   time in a new shape after the manner of Proteus; [286] as some persons
   make it their sport to make changes upon him, [287] just as if they
   were tossing a ball to and fro with their hand, simply for the purpose
   of displaying their dexterity. Others, with a view to procure the favor
   of men, present him under various forms, while there is still another
   class, that inculcate one day what on the next they retract through
   fear. Such was not Paul's Christ, nor can that of any true apostle
   [288] be such. Those, accordingly, have no ground to boast that they
   are ministers of Christ, who paint him in various colors with a view to
   their own advantage. For he alone is the true Christ, in whom there
   appears that uniform and unvarying yea, which Paul declares to be
   characteristic of him.

   20. For all the promises of God -- Here again he shows how firm and
   unvarying the preaching of Christ ought to be, inasmuch as he is the
   groundwork [289] of all the promises of God. For it were worse than
   absurd to entertain the idea that he, in whom all the promises of God
   are established, is like one that wavers. [290] Now though the
   statement is general, as we shall see ere long, it is, notwithstanding,
   accommodated to the circumstances of the case in hand, with the view of
   confirming the certainty of Paul's doctrine. For it is not simply of
   the gospel in general that he treats, but he honors more especially his
   own gospel with this distinction. "If the promises of God are sure and
   well-founded, my preaching also must of necessity be sure, inasmuch as
   it contains nothing but Christ, in whom they are all established." As,
   however, in these words he means simply that he preached a gospel that
   was genuine, and not adulterated by any foreign additions, [291] let us
   keep in view this general doctrine, that all the promises of God rest
   upon Christ alone as their support -- a sentiment that is worthy of
   being kept in remembrance, and is one of the main articles of our
   faith. It depends, however, on another principle -- that it is only in
   Christ that God the Father is propitious to us. Now the promises are
   testimonies of his fatherly kindness towards us. Hence it follows, that
   it is in him alone that they are fulfilled.

   The promises, I say, are testimonies of Divine grace: for although God
   shows kindness even to the unworthy, (Luke 6:35,) yet when promises are
   given in addition to his acts of kindness, there is a special reason --
   that in them he declares himself to be a Father. Secondly, we are not
   qualified for enjoying the promises of God, unless we have received the
   remission of our sins, which we obtain through Christ. Thirdly, the
   promise, by which God adopts us to himself as his sons, holds the first
   place among them all. Now the cause and root of adoption is Christ;
   because God is not a Father to any that are not members and brethren of
   his only-begotten Son. Everything, however, flows out from this source
   -- that, while we are without Christ, we are hated by God rather than
   favorably regarded, while at the same time God promises us everything
   that he does promise, because he loves us. Hence it is not to be
   wondered if Paul here teaches, that all the promises of God are
   ratified and confirmed in Christ.

   It is asked, however, whether they were feeble or powerless, previously
   to Christ's advent; for Paul seems to speak here of Christ as
   manifested in the flesh. (1 Timothy 3:16.) I answer, that all the
   promises that were given to believers from the beginning of the world
   were founded upon Christ. Hence Moses and the Prophets, in every
   instance in which they treat of reconciliation with God, of the hope of
   salvation, or of any other favor, make mention of him, and discourse at
   the same time respecting his coming and his kingdom. I say again, that
   the promises under the Old Testament were fulfilled to the pious, in so
   far as was advantageous for their welfare; and yet it is not less true,
   that they were in a manner suspended until the advent of Christ,
   through whom they obtained their true accomplishment. And in truth,
   believers themselves rested upon the promises in such a way, as at the
   same time to refer the true accomplishment of them to the appearing of
   the Mediator, and suspended their hope until that time. In fine, if any
   one considers what is the fruit of Christ's death and resurrection, he
   will easily gather from this, in what respect the promises of God have
   been sealed and ratified in him, which would otherwise have had no sure
   accomplishment.

   Wherefore, also, through him let there be Amen. Here also the Greek
   manuscripts do not agree, for some of them have it in one continued
   statement -- As many promises of God as there are, are in him Yea, and
   in him Amen to the glory of God through us. [292] The different
   reading, however, which I have followed, is easier, and contains a
   fuller meaning. For as he had said, that, in Christ, God has confirmed
   the truth of all his promises, so now he teaches us, that it is our
   duty to acquiesce in this ratification. This we do, when, resting upon
   Christ by a sure faith, we subscribe and set our seal that God is true,
   as we read in John 3:33, and that with a view to his glory, as this is
   the end to which everything should be referred. (Ephesians 1:13, and
   Romans 3:4.)

   The other reading, I confess, is the more common one, but as it is
   somewhat meagre, I have not hesitated to prefer the one that contains
   the fuller meaning, and, besides, is much better suited to the context.
   For Paul reminds the Corinthians of their duty -- to utter their Amen
   in return, after having been instructed in the simple truth of God. If,
   however, any one is reluctant to depart from the other reading, there
   must, in any case, be an exhortation deduced from it [293] to a mutual
   agreement in doctrine and faith.

   2 Corinthians 1:21-22

   21. Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
   us, is God;

   21. Qui autem confirmat nos vobiscum in Christo, et qui unxit nos, Deus
   est:

   22. Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our
   hearts.

   22. Qui et obsignavit nos, et dedit arrhabonem Spiritus in cordibus
   nostris.


   God, indeed, is always true and steadfast in his promises, and has
   always his Amen, as often as he speaks. But as for us, such is our
   vanity, that we do not utter our Amen in return, except when he gives a
   sure testimony in our hearts by his word. This he does by his Spirit.
   That is what Paul means here. He had previously taught, that this is a
   befitting harmony -- when, on the one hand, the calling of God is
   without repentance, (Romans 11:29,) and we, in our turn, with an
   unwavering faith, accept of the blessing of adoption that is held out
   to us. That God remains steadfast to his promise is not surprising; but
   to keep pace with God in the steadfastness of our faith in return --
   that truly is not in man's power. [294] He teaches us, also, that God
   cures our weakness or defect, (as they term it,) when, by correcting
   our belief, he confirms us by his Spirit. Thus it comes, that we
   glorify him by a firm steadfastness of faith. He associates himself,
   however, with the Corinthians, expressly for the purpose of
   conciliating their affections the better, with a view to the
   cultivation of unity. [295]

   21. Who hath anointed us. He employs different terms to express one and
   the same thing. For along with confirmation, he employs the terms
   anointing and sealing, or, by this twofold metaphor, [296] he explains
   more distinctly what he had previously stated without a figure. For
   God, by pouring down upon us the heavenly grace of the Spirit, does, in
   this manner, seal upon our hearts the certainty of his own word. He
   then introduces a fourth idea -- that the Spirit has been given to us
   as an earnest -- a similitude which he frequently makes use of, and is
   also exceedingly appropriate. [297] For as the Spirit, in bearing
   witness of our adoption, is our security, and, by confirming the faith
   of the promises, is the seal (sphragis), so it is on good grounds that
   he is called an earnest, [298] because it is owing to him, that the
   covenant of God is ratified on both sides, which would, but for this,
   have hung in suspense. [299]

   Here we must notice, in the first place, the relation [300] which Paul
   requires between the gospel of God and our faith; for as every thing
   that God says is more than merely certain, so he wishes that this
   should be established in our minds by a firm and sure assent. Secondly,
   we must observe that, as an assurance of this nature is a thing that is
   above the capacity of the human mind, it is the part of the Holy Spirit
   to confirm within us what God promises in his word. Hence it is that he
   has those titles of distinction -- the Anointing, the Earnest, the
   Comforter, and the Seal. In the third place we must observe, that all
   that have not the Holy Spirit as a witness, so as to return their Amen
   to God, when calling them to an assured hope of salvation, do on false
   grounds assume the name of Christians.

   2 Corinthians 2:1-2

   1. But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to
   you in heaviness.

   1. Decreveram autem hoc in me ipso, non amplius venire in tristitia ad
   vos. [302]

   2. For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the
   same which is made sorry by me?

   2. Si enim ego contristo vos: et quis est qui me exhilaret, nisi is qui
   erit tristitia affectus ex me?


   23. I call God for a witness. He now begins to assign a reason for his
   change of purpose; for hitherto he has merely repelled calumny. When,
   however, he says that he spared them, he indirectly throws back the
   blame upon them, and thus shows them that it would be unfair if he were
   put to grief through their fault, but that it would be much more unfair
   if they should permit this; but most of all unfair if they should give
   their assent to so base a calumny, as in that case they would be
   substituting in their place an innocent person, as if he had been
   guilty of their sin. Now he spared them in this respect, that if he had
   come he would have been constrained to reprove them more severely,
   while he wished rather that they should of their own accord repent
   previously to his arrival, that there might be no occasion for a
   harsher remedy, [303] which is a signal evidence of more than paternal
   lenity. For how much forbearance there was in shunning this necessity,
   when he had just ground of provocation!

   He makes use, also, of an oath, that he may not seem to have contrived
   something to serve a particular purpose. For the matter in itself was
   of no small importance, and it was of great consequence that he should
   be entirely free from all suspicion of falsehood and pretence. Now
   there are two things that make an oath lawful and pious -- the occasion
   and the disposition. The occasion I refer to is, where an oath is not
   employed rashly, that is, in mere trifles, or even in matters of small
   importance, but only where there is a call for it. The disposition I
   refer to is, where there is not so much regard had to private
   advantage, as concern felt for the glory of God, and the advantage of
   the brethren: For this end must always be kept in view, that our oaths
   may promote the honor of God, and promote also the advantage of our
   neighbours in a matter that is befitting. [304]

   The form of the oath must also be observed -- first, that he calls God
   to witness; and, secondly, that he says upon my soul For in matters
   that are doubtful and obscure, where man's knowledge fails, we have
   recourse to God, that he, who alone is truth, may bear testimony to the
   truth. But the man that appeals to God as his witness, calls upon him
   at the same time to be an avenger of perjury, in the event of his
   declaring what is false. This is what is meant by the phrase upon my
   soul. "I do not object to his inflicting punishment upon me, if I am
   guilty of falsehood." Although, however, this is not always expressed
   in so many words, it is, notwithstanding, to be understood. For

   if we are unfaithful, God remaineth faithful
   and will not deny himself (2 Timothy 2:13.)

   He will not suffer, therefore, the profanation of his name to go
   unpunished.

   24. Not that we exercise dominion He anticipates an objection that
   might be brought forward. "What! Do you then act so tyrannically [305]
   as to be formidable in your very look? Such were not the gravity of a
   Christian pastor, but the cruelty of a savage tyrant." He answers this
   objection first indirectly, by declaring that matters are not so; and
   afterwards directly, by showing that the very circumstance, that he had
   been constrained to treat them more harshly, was owing to his fatherly
   affection. When he says that he does not exercise dominion over their
   faith, he intimates, that such a power is unjust and intolerable -- nay
   more, is tyranny in the Church. For faith ought to be altogether
   exempt, and to the utmost extent free, from the yoke of men. We must,
   however, observe, who it is that speaks, for if ever there was a single
   individual of mortals, that had authority to claim for himself such a
   dominion, Paul assuredly was worthy of such a privilege. Yet he
   acknowledges, [306] that it does not belong to him. Hence we infer,
   that faith owns no subjection except to the word of God, and that it is
   not at all in subjection to human control. [307] Erasmus has observed
   in his Annotations, that by supplying the Greek particle heneka, it may
   be understood in this way -- Not that we exercise dominion over you --
   with respect to your faith -- a rendering which amounts almost to the
   same thing. For he intimates, that there is no spiritual dominion,
   except that of God only. This always remains a settled point -- pastors
   have no peculiar dominion over men's consciences, [308] inasmuch as
   they are ministers, not lords. (1 Peter 5:3.)

   What then does he leave to himself and others? He calls them helpers of
   their joy -- by which term I understand happiness. At the same time he
   employs the term joy as opposed to the terror which tyrants awaken
   through means of their cruelty, and also false prophets, [309]
   resembling tyrants, that rule with rigor and authority, as we read in
   Ezekiel 34:4. He argues from contraries, that he did by no means usurp
   dominion over the Corinthians, inasmuch as he endeavored rather to
   maintain them in the possession of a peace that was free, and full of
   joy.

   For by faith ye stand. As to the reason why he adds this, others either
   pass it over altogether in silence, or they do not explain it with
   sufficient distinctness. For my part, I am of opinion that he here
   again argues from contraries. For if the nature and effect of faith be
   such that we lean, in order that we may stand, [310] it is absurd to
   speak of faith as being subject to men. Thus he removes that unjust
   dominion, with which, he had a little before declared, he was not
   chargeable.

   [307] The views here expressed by Calvin are severely animadverted upon
   in the following terms by the Romanists, in the Annotations appended to
   the Rheims version of the New Testament: "Calvin and his seditious
   sectaries with other like which despise dominion, as St. Jude
   describeth such, would by this place deliver themselves from all yoke
   of spiritual Magistrates and Rulers: namely, that they be subject to no
   man touching their faith, or for the examination and trial of their
   doctrine, but to God and his word only. And no marvel that the
   malefactors and rebels of the Church would come to no tribunal but
   God's, that so they may remain unpunished at least during this life.
   For though the Scriptures plainely condemne their heresies, yet they
   could writhe themselves out by false glosses, constructions,
   corruptions, and denials of the bookes to be canonical, if there were
   no lawes or judicial sentences of men to rule and represse them." To
   these statements Dr. Fulke in his elaborate work in refutation of the
   errors of Popery, (Lond. 1601,) p. 559, appropriately replies as
   follows: "This is nothing els but a lewd and senselesse slander of
   Calvin and vs, that we despise lordship, because we will not be subject
   to the tyranny of Antichrist, that would be Lord of our faith, and
   arrogateth vnto himselfe auctoritie to make new articles of fayth,
   which have no ground or warrant in the word of God. But CALVIN did
   willingly acknowledge all auctoritie of the ministers of the Church,
   which the Scripture doth allow unto them, and both practiced, and
   submitted himselfe to the discipline of the Church, and the lawful
   gouernours thereof, although he would not yield unto the tyrannicall
   yoke of the Pope, who is neither soueraigne of the Church, nor any true
   member of the same. Yea, Calvin and we submit ourselves, not only to
   the auctoritie of the Church, but also of the Ciuile Magistrates to be
   punished, if we shall be found to teach or doe any thing contrary to
   the doctrine of faith, receyued and approved by the Church, whereas the
   Popish clergy, in causes of religion, will not be subject to the
   temporal gouernors, judgement, and correction." -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   1 But I had determined Whoever it was that divided the chapters, made
   here a foolish division. For now at length the Apostle explains, in
   what manner he had spared them. "I had determined," says he, "not to
   come to you any more in sorrow," or in other words, to occasion you
   sorrow by my coming. For he had come once by an Epistle, by means of
   which he had severely pained them. Hence, so long as they had not
   repented, he was unwilling to come to them, lest he should be
   constrained to grieve them again, when present with them, for he chose
   rather to give them longer time for repentance. [311] The word ekrina
   (I determined) must be rendered in the pluperfect tense, [312] for,
   when assigning a reason for the delay that had occurred, he explains
   what had been his intention previously.

   2. For if I make you sorry Here we have the proof of the foregoing
   statement. No one willingly occasions sorrow to himself. Now Paul says,
   that he has such a fellow-feeling with the Corinthians, [313] that he
   cannot feel joyful, unless he sees them happy. Nay more, he declares
   that they were the source and the authors of his joy -- which they
   could not be, if they were themselves sorrowful. If this disposition
   prevail in pastors, it will be the best restraint, to keep them back
   from alarming with terrors those minds, which they ought rather to have
   encouraged by means of a cheerful affability. For from this arises an
   excessively morose harshness [314] -- so that we do not rejoice in the
   welfare of the Church, as were becoming.

   2 Corinthians 2:3-5

   3. And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have
   sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you
   all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

   3. Et scripseram vobis hoc, ne veniens tristitiam super tristitiam
   haberem, a quibus oportebat me gaudere: fiduciam habens de vobis
   omnibus, quod meum gaudium vestrum omnium sit.

   4. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
   with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know
   the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

   4. Ex multa enim afflictione et angustia cordis scripsi vobis per
   multas lacrimas: non ut contristaremini, sed ut caritatem
   cognosceretis, quam habeo abundantius erga vos.

   5. But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
   that I may not overcharge you all.

   5. Si quis autem contristavit, non me contristavit, sed ex parte: ut ne
   vos omnes gravem.


   3. I had written to you. As he had said a little before, that he
   delayed coming to them, in order that he might not come a second time
   in sorrow and with severity, (2 Corinthians 2:1,) so now also he lets
   them know, that he came the first time in sadness by an Epistle, that
   they might not have occasion to feel this severity when he was present
   with them. Hence they have no ground to complain of that former
   sadness, in which he was desirous to consult their welfare. He goes
   even a step farther, by stating that, when writing, he did not wish to
   occasion them grief, or to give any expression of displeasure, but, on
   the contrary, to give proof of his attachment and affection towards
   them. In this way, if there was any degree of keenness in the Epistle,
   he does not merely soften it, but even shows amiableness and suavity.
   When, however, he confesses afterwards, what he here denies, he appears
   to contradict himself. I answer, that there is no inconsistency, for he
   does not come afterwards to confess, that it was his ultimate object to
   grieve the Corinthians, but that this was the means, by which he
   endeavored to conduct them to true joy. Previously, however, to his
   stating this, he speaks here simply as to his design. He passes over in
   silence, or delays mentioning for a little the means, which were not so
   agreeable.

   Having confidence This confidence he exercises towards the Corinthians,
   that they may thus in their turn be persuaded of his friendly
   disposition. For he that hates, is envious; but where joy is felt in
   common, there must in that case be perfect love. [315] If, however, the
   Corinthians are not in accordance with Paul's opinion and judgment as
   to them, they shamefully disappoint him.

   4. For out of much affliction Here he brings forward another reason
   with the view of softening the harshness which he had employed. For
   those who smilingly take delight in seeing others weep, inasmuch as
   they discover thereby their cruelty, cannot and ought not to be borne
   with. Paul, however, declares that his feeling was very different.
   "Intensity of grief," says he, "has extorted from me every thing that I
   have written." Who would not excuse, and take in good part what springs
   from such a temper of mind, more especially as it was not on his own
   account or through his own fault, that he suffered grief, and farther,
   he does not give vent to his grief, with the view of lightning himself
   by burdening them, but rather, for the purpose of shewing his affection
   for them? On these accounts, it did not become the Corinthians to be
   offended at this somewhat severe reproof.

   He adds, tears -- which, in a man that is brave and magnanimous are a
   token of intense grief. Hence we see, from what emotions of mind pious
   and holy admonitions and reproofs must of necessity proceed. For there
   are many noisy reprovers, who, by declaiming, or rather, fulminating
   against vices, display a surprising ardour of zeal, while in the mean
   time they are at ease in their mind, [316] so that it might seem as if
   they exercised their throat and sides [317] by way of sport. It is,
   however, the part of a pious pastor, to weep within himself, before he
   calls upon others to weep: [318] to feel tortured in silent musings,
   before he shows any token of displeasure; and to keep within his own
   breast more grief, than he causes to others. We must, also, take notice
   of Paul's tears, which, by their abundance, shew tenderness of heart,
   but it is of a more heroical character than was the iron-hearted
   hardness of the Stoics. [319] For the more tender the affections of
   love are, they are so much the more praiseworthy.

   The adverb more abundantly may be explained in a comparative sense;
   and, in that case, it would be a tacit complaint -- that the
   Corinthians do not make an equal return in respect of affection,
   inasmuch as they love but coldly one by whom they are ardently loved. I
   take it, however, in a more simple way, as meaning that Paul commends
   his affection towards them, in order that this assurance may soften
   down every thing of harshness that might be in his words.

   5. But if any one. Here is a third reason with the view of alleviating
   the offense -- that he had grief in common with them, and that the
   occasion of it came from another quarter. "We have," says he, "been
   alike grieved, and another is to blame for it." At the same time he
   speaks of that person, too, somewhat mildly, when he says, if any one
   -- not affirming the thing, but rather leaving it in suspense. This
   passage, however, is understood by some, as if Paul meant to say: "He
   that has given me occasion of grief, has given offense to you also; for
   you ought to have felt grieved along with me, and yet I have been left
   almost to grieve alone. For I do not wish to say so absolutely -- that
   I may not put the blame upon you all." In this way the second clause
   would contain a correction of the first. Chrysostom's exposition,
   however, is much more suitable; for he reads it as one continued
   sentence -- "He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you. And
   as to my saying in part, I do so in order that I may not bear too hard
   upon him." [320] I differ from Chrysostom merely in the clause in part,
   for I understand it as meaning in some measure. I am aware, that
   Ambrose understands it as meaning -- part of the saints, inasmuch as
   the Church of the Corinthians was divided; but that is more ingenious
   than solid.

   2 Corinthians 2:6-11

   6. Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of
   many.

   6. Sufficit ei, qui talis est, correctio, quae illi contigit a
   pluribus.

   7. So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
   him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
   sorrow.

   7. Ut potius e diverso debeatis condonare, et consolari: ne forte
   abundantiori tristitia absorbeatur, qui eiusmodi est.

   8. Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.

   8. Quamobrem obsecro vos, ut confirmetis erga eum caritatem.

   9. For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of
   you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

   9. Nam in hoc etiam scripseram vobis, ut probationem vestri
   cognoscerem: an ad omnia obedientes sitis.

   10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any
   thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person
   of Christ;

   10. Cui autem condonatis, etiam ego: etenim cui condonavi, si quid
   condonavi, propter vos condonavi in conspectu Christi.

   11. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant
   of his devices.

   11. Ut ne occupemur a Satana: non enim cogitationes eius ignoramus.


   6. Sufficient. He now extends kindness even to the man who had sinned
   more grievously than the others, and on whose account his anger had
   been kindled against them all, inasmuch as they had connived at his
   crime. In his showing indulgence even to one who was deserving of
   severer punishment, the Corinthians have a striking instance to
   convince them, how much he disliked excessive harshness. It is true,
   that he does not act this part merely for the sake of the Corinthians,
   but because he was naturally of a forgiving temper; but still, in this
   instance of mildness, the Corinthians could not but perceive his
   remarkable kindness of disposition. In addition to this, he does not
   merely show himself to be indulgent, but exhorts others to receive him
   into favor, in the exercise of the same mildness.

   Let us, however, consider these things a little more minutely. He
   refers to the man who had defiled himself by an incestuous marriage
   with his mother-in-law. As the iniquity was not to be tolerated, Paul
   had given orders, that the man should be excommunicated. He had, also,
   severely reproved the Corinthians, because they had so long given
   encouragement to that enormity [321] by their dissimulation and patient
   endurance. It appears from this passage, that he had been brought to
   repentance, after having been admonished by the Church. Hence Paul
   gives orders, that he be forgiven, and that he be also supported by
   consolation.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed, as it shows us, with what
   equity and clemency the discipline of the Church ought to be regulated,
   in order that there may not be undue severity. There is need of
   strictness, in order that the wicked may not be rendered more daring by
   impunity, which is justly pronounced an allurement to vice. But on the
   other hand, as there is a danger of the person, who is chastised,
   becoming dispirited, moderation must be used as to this -- so that the
   Church shall be prepared to extend forgiveness, so soon as she is fully
   satisfied as to his penitence. In this department, I find a lack of
   wisdom on the part of the ancient bishops; and indeed they ought not to
   be excused, but on the contrary, we ought rather to mark their error,
   that we may learn to avoid it. Paul is satisfied with the repentance of
   the offender, that a reconciliation may take place with the Church.
   They, on the other hand, by making no account of his repentance, have
   issued out canons as to repentance during three years, during seven
   years, and in some cases during life. By these they exclude poor
   unhappy men from the fellowship of the Church. And, in this way, the
   offender is either alienated the more from the Church, or [322] is
   induced to practice hypocrisy. But even if the enactment were more
   plausible in itself, this consideration would, in my view, be enough to
   condemn it -- that it is at variance with the rule of the Holy Spirit,
   which the Apostle here prescribes.

   7. Lest such an one should be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow The end
   of excommunication, so far as concerns the power of the offender, is
   this: that, overpowered with a sense of his sin, he may be humbled in
   the sight of God and the Church, and may solicit pardon with sincere
   dislike and confession of guilt. The man who has been brought to this,
   is now more in need of consolation, than of severe reproof. Hence, if
   you continue to deal with him harshly, it will be -- not discipline,
   but cruel domineering. Hence we must carefully guard against pressing
   them beyond this limit. [323] For nothing is more dangerous, than to
   give Satan a handle, to tempt an offender to despair. Now we furnish
   Satan with arms in every instance, in which we leave without
   consolation those, who are in good earnest affected with a view of
   their sin.

   9. For I had written to you also for this purpose. He anticipates an
   objection, that they might bring forward. "What then did you mean, when
   you were so very indignant, because we had not inflicted punishment
   upon him? From being so stern a judge, to become all at once a defender
   -- is not this indicative of a man, that wavers between conflicting
   dispositions?" [324] This idea might detract greatly from Paul's
   authority; but he answers, that he has obtained what he asked, and that
   he was therefore satisfied, so that he must now give way to compassion.
   For, their carelessness having been corrected, there was nothing to
   hinder their lifting up the man by their clemency, when now prostrate
   and downcast. [325]

   10. To whom ye forgive. That he might the more readily appease them, he
   added his vote in support of the pardon extended by them. [326] "Do not
   hesitate to forgive: I promise that I shall confirm whatever you may
   have done, and I already subscribe your sentence of forgiveness."
   Secondly, he says that he does this for their sake; and that too,
   sincerely and cordially. He had already shown how desirous he was, that
   the man's welfare should be consulted: he now declares, that he grants
   this willingly to the Corinthians.

   Instead of the expression in the sight of Christ, some prefer person,
   [327] because Paul in that reconciliation was in the room of Christ,
   [328] and did in a manner represent his person. [329] I am, however,
   more inclined to understand him as declaring, that he forgives
   sincerely and without any pretence. For he is accustomed to employ this
   phrase to express pure and undisguised rectitude. If, however, any one
   prefers the former interpretation, it is to be observed that the person
   of Christ is interposed, because there is nothing that ought to incline
   us more to the exercise of mercy.

   11. That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan. This may be viewed
   as referring to what he had said previously respecting excessive
   sorrow. For it is a most wicked [330] fraud of Satan, when depriving us
   of all consolation, he swallows us up, as it were, in a gulf of
   despair; and such is the explanation that is given of it by Chrysostom.
   I prefer, however, to view it as referring to Paul and the Corinthians.
   For there was a twofold danger, that beset them from the stratagems of
   Satan -- in the event of their being excessively harsh and rigorous,
   or, on the other hand, in case of dissension arising among them. For it
   very frequently happens, that, under colour of zeal for discipline, a
   Pharisaical rigour creeps in, which hurries on the miserable offender
   to ruin, instead of curing him. It is rather, however, in my opinion,
   of the second danger that he speaks; for if Paul had not to some extent
   favored the wishes of the Corinthians, Satan would have prevailed by
   kindling strife among them.

   For we are not ignorant of his devices That is, "We know, from being
   warned of it by the Lord, that one stratagem to which he carefully has
   recourse is, that when he cannot ruin us by open means, he surprises us
   when off our guard by making a secret attack. [331] As, then, we are
   aware that he makes an attack upon us by indirect artifices, and that
   he assails us by secret machinations, we must look well before us, and
   carefully take heed that he may not, from some quarter, do us injury.
   He employs the word devices in the sense in which the Hebrews make use
   of the term zmh (zimmah,) but in a bad sense, [332] as meaning artful
   schemes and machinations, which ought not to be unknown to believers,
   and will not be so, provided they give themselves up to the guidance of
   God's Spirit. In short, as God warns us, that Satan employs every means
   to impose upon us, and, in addition to this, shows us by what methods
   he may practice imposture upon us, it is our part to be on the alert,
   that he may have not a single chink to creep through.

   2 Corinthians 2:12-17

   12. Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a
   door was opened unto me of the Lord,

   12. Porro quum venissem Troadem in Evangelium Christi; etiam ostio mihi
   aperto in Domino,

   13. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother:
   but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

   13. Non habui relaxationem spiritui meo, eo quod non inveneram Titum
   fratrem meum; sed illis valedicens profectus sum in Macedoniam.

   14. Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
   Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every
   place.

   14. Deo autem gratia, qui semper triumphare nos facit in Christo; et
   odorem cognitionis eius manifestat per nos in omni loco.

   15. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
   saved, and in them that perish:

   15. Quia Christi suavis odor sumus Deo, in iis qui salvi fiunt, et in
   iis qui pereunt.

   16. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other
   the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

   16. Aliis quidem odor mortis in mortem, illis vero odor vitae in vitam;
   et ad haec quis idoneus?

   17. For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of
   sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

   17. Non enim sumus quemadmodum multi, adulterantes sermonem Dei: sed
   tanquam ex sinceritate, tanquam ex Deo, in conspectu Dei in Christo
   loquimur. [333]


   12. When I had come to Troas By now mentioning what he had been doing
   in the mean time, in what places he had been, and what route he had
   pursued in his journeyings, he more and more confirms what he had said
   previously as to his coming to the Corinthians. He says that he had
   come to Troas from Ephesus for the sake of the gospel, for he would not
   have proceeded in that direction, when going into Achaia, had he not
   been desirous to pass through Macedonia. As, however, he did not find
   Titus there, whom he had sent to Corinth, and by whom he ought to have
   been informed respecting the state of that Church, though he might have
   done much good there, and though he had an opportunity presented to
   him, yet, he says, setting everything aside, he came to Macedonia,
   desirous to see Titus. Here is an evidence of a singular degree of
   attachment to the Corinthians, that he was so anxious respecting them,
   that he had no rest anywhere, even when a large prospect of usefulness
   presented itself, until he had learned the state of their affairs.
   Hence it appears why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish
   to come to them until he had learned the state of their affairs. Hence
   it appears, why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to
   come to them, until he had first had a conversation with Titus. He
   afterwards learned from the report brought him by Titus, that matters
   were at that time not yet ripe for his coming to them. Hence it is
   evident, that Paul loved the Corinthians so much, that he accommodated
   all his journeyings and long circuits to their welfare, and that he had
   accordingly come to them later than he had promised -- not from having,
   in forgetfulness of his promise, rashly changed his plan, or from
   having been carried away by some degree of fickleness, (2 Corinthians
   1:17,) but because delay was more profitable for them.

   A door also having been opened to me. We have spoken of this metaphor
   when commenting on the last chapter of the First Epistle. (1
   Corinthians 16:9.) Its meaning is, that an opportunity of promoting the
   gospel had presented itself. [334] For as an opportunity of entering is
   furnished when the door is opened, so the servants of the Lord make
   advances when an opportunity is presented. The door is shut, when no
   prospect of usefulness is held out. Now as, on the door being shut, it
   becomes us to enter upon a new course, rather than by farther efforts
   to weary ourselves to no purpose by useless labor, so where an
   opportunity presents itself of edifying, let us consider that by the
   hand of God a door is opened to us for introducing Christ there, and
   let us not withhold compliance with so kind an indication from God.
   [335]

   It may seem, however, as if Paul had erred in this -- that
   disregarding, or at least leaving unimproved, an opportunity that was
   placed within his reach, he betook himself to Macedonia. "Ought he not
   rather to have applied himself to the work that he had in hand, than,
   after making little more than a commencement, break away all on a
   sudden in another direction?" We have also observed already, that the
   opening of a door is an evidence of a divine call, and this is
   undoubtedly true. I answer, that, as Paul was not by any means
   restricted to one Church, but was bound to many at the same time, it
   was not his duty, in consequence of the present aspect of one of them,
   to leave off concern as to the others. Farther, the more connection he
   had with the Corinthian Church, it was his duty to be so much the more
   inclined to aid it; for we must consider it to be reasonable, that a
   Church, which he had founded by his ministry, should be regarded by him
   with a singular affection [336] -- just as at this day it is our duty,
   indeed, to promote the welfare of the whole Church, and to be concerned
   for the entire body of it; and yet, every one has, nevertheless, a
   closer and holier connection with his own Church, to whose interests he
   is more particularly devoted. Matters were in an unhappy state at
   Corinth, so that Paul was in no ordinary degree anxious as to the
   issue. It is not, therefore, to be wondered, if, under the influence of
   this motive, he left unimproved an opportunity that in other
   circumstances was not to be neglected; as it was not in his power to
   occupy every post of duty at one and the same time. It is not, however,
   at all likely that he left Troas, till he had first introduced some one
   in his place to improve the opening that had occurred. [337]

   14. But thanks be to God Here he again glories in the success of his
   ministry, and shows that he had been far from idle in the various
   places he had visited; but that he may do this in no invidious way, he
   sets out with a thanksgiving, which we shall find him afterwards
   repeating. Now he does not, in a spirit of ambition, extol his own
   actions, that his name may be held in renown, nor does he, in mere
   pretense, give thanks to God in the manner of the Pharisee, while
   lifted up, in the mean time, with pride and arrogance. (Luke 18:11.)
   Instead of this, he desires from his heart, that whatever is worthy of
   praise, be recognised as the work of God alone, that his power alone
   may be extolled. Farther, he recounts his own praises with a view to
   the advantage of the Corinthians, that, on hearing that he had served
   the Lord with so much fruit in other places, they may not allow his
   labor to be unproductive among themselves, and may learn to respect his
   ministry, which God everywhere rendered so glorious and fruitful. For
   what God so illustriously honors, it is criminal to despise, or lightly
   esteem. Nothing was more injurious to the Corinthians, than to have an
   unfavorable view of Paul's Apostleship and doctrine: nothing, on the
   other hand, was more advantageous, than to hold both in esteem. Now he
   had begun to be held in contempt by many, and hence, it was not his
   duty to be silent. In addition to this, he sets this holy boasting in
   opposition to the revilings of the wicked.

   Who causeth us to triumph If you render the word literally, it will be,
   Qui nos triumphat -- Who triumpheth over us. [338] Paul, however, means
   something different from what this form of expression denotes among the
   Latins. [339] For captives are said to be triumphed over, when, by way
   of disgrace, they are bound with chains and dragged before the chariot
   of the conqueror. Paul's meaning, on the other hand, is, that he was
   also a sharer in the triumph enjoyed by God, because it had been gained
   by his instrumentality, just as the lieutenants accompanied on
   horseback the chariot of the chief general, as sharers in the honor.
   [340] As, accordingly, all the ministers of the gospel fight under
   God's auspices, so they also procure for him the victory and the honor
   of the triumph; [341] but, at the same time, he honors each of them
   with a share of the triumph, according to the station assigned him in
   the army, and proportioned to the exertions made by him. Thus they
   enjoy, as it were, a triumph, but it is God's rather than theirs. [342]

   He adds, in Christ, in whose person God himself triumphs, inasmuch as
   he has conferred upon him all the glory of empire. Should any one
   prefer to render it thus: "Who triumphs by means of us," even in that
   way a sufficiently consistent meaning will be made out.

   The odor of his knowledge. The triumph consisted in this, that God,
   through his instrumentality, wrought powerfully and gloriously,
   perfuming the world with the health-giving odor of his grace, while, by
   means of his doctrine, he brought some to the knowledge of Christ. He
   carries out, however, the metaphor of odor, by which he expresses both
   the delectable sweetness of the gospel, and its power and efficacy for
   inspiring life. In the mean time, Paul instructs them, that his
   preaching is so far from being savourless, that it quickens souls by
   its very odor. Let us, however, learn from this, that those alone make
   right proficiency in the gospel, who, by the sweet fragrance of Christ,
   are stirred up to desire him, so as to bid farewell to the allurements
   of the world.

   He says in every place, intimating by these words, that he went to no
   place in which he did not gain some fruit, and that, wherever he went,
   there was to be seen some reward of his labor. The Corinthians were
   aware, in how many places he had previously sowed the seed of Christ's
   gospel. He now says, that the last corresponded with the first. [343]

   15. A sweet odor of Christ The metaphor which he had applied to the
   knowledge of Christ, he now transfers to the persons of the Apostles,
   but it is for the same reason. For as they are called the light of the
   world, (Matthew 5:14,) because they enlighten men by holding forth the
   torch of the gospel, and not as if they shone forth upon them with
   their own lustre; so they have the name of odor, not as if they emitted
   any fragrance of themselves, but because the doctrine which they bring
   is odoriferous, so that it can imbue the whole world with its
   delectable fragrance. [344] It is certain, however, that this
   commendation is applicable to all the ministers of the gospel, because
   wherever there is a pure and unvarnished proclamation of the gospel,
   there will be found there the influence of that odor, of which Paul
   here speaks. At the same time, there is no doubt, that he speaks
   particularly of himself, and those that were like him, turning to his
   own commendation what slanderers imputed to him as a fault. For his
   being opposed by many, and exposed to the hatred of many, was the
   reason why they despised him. He, accordingly, replies, that faithful
   and upright ministers of the gospel have a sweet odor before God, not
   merely when they quicken souls by a wholesome savour, but also, when
   they bring destruction to unbelievers. Hence the gospel ought not to be
   less esteemed on that account. "Both odors," says he, "are grateful to
   God -- that by which the elect are refreshed unto salvation, and that
   from which the wicked receive a deadly shock."

   Here we have a remarkable passage, by which we are taught, that,
   whatever may be the issue of our preaching, it is, notwithstanding,
   well-pleasing to God, if the Gospel is preached, and our service will
   be acceptable to him; and also, that it does not detract in any degree
   from the dignity of the Gospel, that it does not do good to all; for
   God is glorified even in this, that the Gospel becomes an occasion of
   ruin to the wicked, nay, it must turn out so. If, however, this is a
   sweet odor to God, it ought to be so to us also, or in other words, it
   does not become us to be offended, if the preaching of the Gospel is
   not salutary to all; but on the contrary, let us reckon, that it is
   quite enough, if it advance the glory of God by bringing just
   condemnation upon the wicked. If, however, the heralds of the Gospel
   are in bad odor in the world, because their success does not in all
   respects come up to their desires, they have this choice consolation,
   that they waft to God the perfume of a sweet fragrance, and what is to
   the world an offensive smell, is a sweet odor to God and angels. [345]

   The term odor is very emphatic. "Such is the influence of the Gospel in
   both respects, that it either quickens or kills, not merely by its
   taste, but by its very smell. Whatever it may be, it is never preached
   in vain, but has invariably an effect, either for life, or for death."
   [346] But it is asked, how this accords with the nature of the Gospel,
   which we shall find him, a little afterwards, calling the ministry of
   life? (2 Corinthians 3:6.) The answer is easy: The Gospel is preached
   for salvation: this is what properly belongs to it; but believers alone
   are partakers of that salvation. In the mean time, its being an
   occasion of condemnation to unbelievers -- that arises from their own
   fault. Thus

   Christ came not into the world to condemn the world,
   (John 3:17,)

   for what need was there of this, inasmuch as without him we are all
   condemned? Yet he sends his apostles to bind, as well as to loose, and
   to retain sins, as well as remit them. (Matthew 18:18; John 20:23.) He
   is the light of the world, (John 8:12,) but he blinds unbelievers.
   (John 9:39.) He is a Rock, for a foundation, but he is also to many a
   stone of stumbling. [347] (Isaiah 8:14.) We must always, therefore,
   distinguish between the proper office of the Gospel, [348] and the
   accidental one (so to speak) which must be imputed to the depravity of
   mankind, to which it is owing, that life to them is turned into death.

   16. And who is sufficient for these things? This exclamation is thought
   by some [349] to be introduced by way of guarding against arrogance,
   for he confesses, that to discharge the office of a good Apostle [350]
   to Christ is a thing that exceeds all human power, and thus he ascribes
   the praise to God. Others think, that he takes notice of the small
   number of good ministers. I am of opinion, that there is an implied
   contrast that is shortly afterwards expressed. "Profession, it is true,
   is common, and many confidently boast; but to have the reality, is
   indicative of a rare and distinguished excellence. [351] I claim
   nothing for myself, but what will be discovered to be in me, if trial
   is made." Accordingly, as those, who hold in common the office of
   instructor, claim to themselves indiscriminately the title, Paul, by
   claiming to himself a peculiar excellence, separates himself from the
   herd of those, who had little or no experience of the influence of the
   Spirit.

   17. For we are not. He now contrasts himself more openly with the false
   apostles, and that by way of amplifying, and at the same time, with the
   view of excluding them from the praise that he had claimed to himself.
   "It is on good grounds," says he, "that I speak in honorable terms of
   my apostleship, for I am not afraid of being convicted of vanity, if
   proof is demanded. But many on false grounds arrogate the same thing to
   themselves, who will be found to have nothing in common with me. For
   they adulterate the word of the Lord, which I dispense with the
   greatest faithfulness and sincerity for the edification of the Church."
   I do not think it likely, however, that those, who are here reproved,
   preached openly wicked or false doctrines; but am rather of opinion,
   that they corrupted the right use of doctrine, for the sake either of
   gain or of ambition, so as utterly to deprive it of energy. This he
   terms adulterating. Erasmus prefers to render it -- cauponari --
   huckstering [352] The Greek word kapeleuein, is taken from retailers,
   or tavern-keepers, who are accustomed to adulterate their commodities,
   that they may fetch a higher price. I do not know whether the word
   cauponari is used in that sense among the Latins. [353]

   It is, indeed, certain from the corresponding clause, that Paul
   intended to express here -- corruption of doctrine -- not as though
   they had revolted from the truth, but because they presented it under
   disguise, and not in its genuine purity. For the doctrine of God is
   corrupted in two ways. It is corrupted in a direct way, when it is
   mixed up with falsehood and lies, so as to be no longer the pure and
   genuine doctrine of God, but is falsely commended under that title. It
   is corrupted indirectly, when, although retaining its purity, it is
   turned hither and thither to please men, and is disfigured by unseemly
   disguises, by way of hunting after favor. Thus there will be found
   some, in whose doctrine there will be no impiety detected, but as they
   hunt after the applauses of the world by making a display of their
   acuteness and eloquence, or are ambitious of some place, or gape for
   filthy lucre, (1 Timothy 3:8,) or are desirous by some means or other
   to rise, they, nevertheless, corrupt the doctrine itself by wrongfully
   abusing it, or making it subservient to their depraved inclinations. I
   am, therefore, inclined to retain the word adulterate, as it expresses
   better what ordinarily happens in the case of all that play with the
   sacred word of God, as with a ball, and transform it according to their
   own convenience. [354] For it must necessarily be, that they degenerate
   from the truth, and preach a sort of artificial and spurious Gospel.

   But as of sincerity. The word as here is superfluous, as in many other
   places. [355] In contrast with the corruption that he had made mention
   of, he makes use, first of all, of the term sincerity, which may be
   taken as referring to the manner of preaching, as well as to the
   disposition of the mind. I approve rather of the latter. Secondly, he
   places in contrast with it a faithful and conscientious dispensation of
   it, inasmuch as he faithfully delivers to the Church from hand to hand,
   [356] as they say, the Gospel which God had committed to him, and had
   given him in charge. Thirdly, he subjoins to this a regard to the
   Divine presence. For whoever has the three following things, is in no
   danger of forming the purpose of corrupting the word of God. The first
   is -- that we be actuated by a true zeal for God. The second is -- that
   we bear in mind that it is his business that we are transacting, and
   bring forward nothing but what has come from him. The third is -- that
   we consider, that we do nothing of which he is not the witness and
   spectator, and thus learn to refer every thing to his judgment.

   In Christ means according to Christ. For the rendering of Erasmus, By
   Christ, is foreign to Paul's intention. [357]

   [341] "A triumph among the Romans, to which the Apostle here alludes,
   was a public and solemn honor conferred by them on a victorious
   general, by allowing him a magnificent procession through the city.
   This was not granted by the senate unless the general had gained a very
   signal and decisive victory; conquered a province, etc. [...] The
   people at Corinth were sufficiently acquainted with the nature of a
   triumph: about two hundred years before this, Lucius Mummius, the Roman

   reason, that there is here an allusion to the perfumes that were
   usually censed during the triumphal processions of Roman conquerors.
   Plutarch, on an occasion of this kind, describes the streets and
   temples as being thumiamaton plerei" -- full of incense,' which might
   not improperly be called an odour of death to the vanquished, and of
   life to the conquerors. It is possible that in the following verses the
   Apostle further alludes to the different effects of strong perfumes, to
   cheer some, and to throw others into various disorders, according to
   the different dispositions they may be in to receive them. There is,
   perhaps, not equal foundation for another conjecture which has been
   offered, that the expression, causeth us to triumph in Christ, contains
   an allusion to the custom of victorious generals, who, in their
   triumphal processions, were wont to carry some of their relations with
   them in their chariot." -- Illustrated Commentary. -- Ed.

   [345] "We are unto God a sweet savor (or odour, rather, as the word
   osme more properly signifies) of Christ in them that are saved and in
   them that perish. To the one we are the odour of death unto death; to
   the other, the odour of life unto life.' And this lay with a mighty
   weight upon his spirit. O that ever we should be the savor of death
   unto death to any! Who is sufficient for these things! But whether of
   life or death, we are a sweet odour to God in Christ, as to both; when
   he sees the sincerity of our hearts, and how fain we would fetch souls
   out of the state of death into this life. So grateful and pleasant to
   him is the work effected of saving souls, that the attempt and desire
   of it is not ungrateful." -- Howe's Works, (Lond. 1834,) p.999.

   [346] "We are the savor of death unto death. It is probable that the
   language here used is borrowed from similar expressions which were
   common among the Jews. Thus in Debarim Rabba, section. 1. fol. 248, it
   is said, As the bee brings some honey to the owner, but stings others;
   so it is with the words of the law.' They (the words of the law) are a
   savor of life to Israel, but savor of death to the people of this
   world.' Thus in Taarieth, fol. 7:1, Whoever gives attention to the law
   on account of the law itself, to him it becomes an aromatic of life, sm
   chyym (sam chiim); but to him who does not attend to the law on account
   of the law itself, to him it becomes an aromatic of death, sm mvt,(sam
   maveth)' -- the idea of which is, that as medicines skilfully applied
   will heal, but if unskilfully applied will aggravate a disease, so it

   odour of death to the Gentiles.'" -- Barnes. -- Ed.

   [348] "Le propre et naturel office de l'Euangile;" -- "The proper and

   [349] Among these is Chrysostom, who, when commenting upon this

   "Having uttered great things -- that we are an offering, and a sweet
   savor of Christ, and that we are made to triumph everywhere, he again
   qualifies this by ascribing everything to God. Accordingly he says: And
   who is sufficient for these things? For everything, says he, is
   Christ's -- nothing is ours: you see that he expresses himself in a
   manner directly opposite to that of the false apostles. For these,
   indeed, boast, as if they of themselves contributed something towards
   their preaching, while he, on the other hand, says, that he boasts on
   this ground -- because nothing, he says, is his." -- Ed.

   [352] "Erasme l'a traduit par vn autre mot Latin que moy, qui vient
   d'vn mot qui signifie tauernier;" -- "Erasmus has rendered it by a
   Latin word different from what I have used -- derived from a word that
   signifies a tavern -- keeper."

   [353] Raphelius adduces a passage from Herodotus, (lib. in. page 225,)
   in which, when speaking of Darius Hystaspes, who first exacted tribute
   from the Persians, he says that the Persians said, "os Dareios mesn en
   kaspelos, hoti ekapeleue panta ta prasgmata," -- "that Darius was a
   huckster, for he made gain of everything." Herodian (lib. 6, cap. 11)
   uses the expression, "Eirenen chruiou kapeleuontes," -- "Making peace
   for money." The phrase, Cauponari bellum, is employed in a similar
   sense by Cicero (Off 1:12) as meaning, "to make war for money." In
   Isaiah 1:22, the Septuagint version reads as follows: "Hoi kapeloi sou
   misgousi'ton oinon hudati;" -- "Thy vintners mix the wine with water."
   Kaphlo, as Dr. Bloomfield shows by two passages from Plato, properly
   means a retail-dealer, one who deals at second hand. "The kapeloi," he
   observes, "were petty chapmen, (and that chiefly in eatables or
   drinkables,) exactly corresponding to our hucksters." -- Ed.

   [354] The reader will find this class of persons referred to at greater
   length by Calvin, when [19]commenting on 2 Corinthians 1:19. -- Ed.

   [355] Thus in Acts 17:14, we read that the brethren sent away Paul to
   go (hos" epi ten thalassan) as to the sea, where hos (as) is redundant,
   in accordance with various instances cited by Wetstein from Pausanias
   and Arrian of the very same expression. -- Ed.

   Christ, as his legates." -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 3

   2 Corinthians 3:1-3

   1. Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others,
   epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?

   1. Incipimus rursum nos ipsos commendare? numquid, sicuti quidam,
   commendaticiis epistolis opus habemus ad vos? aut commendaticiis a
   vobis?

   2. Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:

   2. Epistola nostra vos estis, scripta in cordibus nostris, quae
   cognoscitur et legitur ab omnibus hominibus.

   3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ
   ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
   living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.

   3. Dum palam fit, vos esse Epistolam Christi, subministratam a nobis,
   scriptam non atramento, sed Spiritu Dei vivi: non in tabulis lapideis,
   sed in tabulis cordis carneis. [358]


   1. Do we begin It appears that this objection also was brought forward
   against him -- that he was excessively fond of publishing his own
   exploits, and brought against him, too, by those who were grieved to
   find that the fame, which they were eagerly desirous to obtain, was
   effectually obstructed in consequence of his superior excellence. They
   had already, in my opinion, found fault with the former Epistle, on
   this ground, that he indulged immoderately in commendations of himself.
   To commend here means to boast foolishly and beyond measure, or at
   least to recount one's own praises in a spirit of ambition. Paul's
   calumniators had a plausible pretext -- that it is a disgusting [359]
   and odious thing in itself for one to be the trumpeter of his own
   praises. Paul, however, had an excuse on the ground of necessity,
   inasmuch as he gloried, only because he was shut up to it. His design
   also raised him above all calumny, as he had nothing in view but that
   the honor of his apostleship might remain unimpaired for the
   edification of the Church; for had not Christ's honor been infringed
   upon, he would readily have allowed to pass unnoticed what tended to
   detract from his own reputation. Besides, he saw that it was very much
   against the Corinthians, that his authority was lessened among them. In
   the first place, therefore, he brings forward their calumny, letting
   them know that he is not altogether ignorant as to the kind of talk,
   that was current among them.

   Have we need? The answer is suited (to use a common expression) to the
   person rather than to the thing, though we shall find him afterwards
   saying as much as was required in reference to the thing itself. At
   present, however, he reproves their malignity, inasmuch as they were
   displeased, if he at any time reluctantly, nay even when they
   themselves constrained him, made mention of the grace that God had
   bestowed upon him, while they were themselves begging in all quarters
   for epistles, that were stuffed entirely with flattering commendations.
   He says that he has no need of commendation in words, while he is
   abundantly commended by his deeds. On the other hand, he convicts them
   of a greedy desire for glory, inasmuch as they endeavored to acquire
   favor through the suffrages of men. [360] In this manner, he gracefully
   and appropriately repels their calumny. We must not, however, infer
   from this, that it is absolutely and in itself wrong to receive
   recommendations, [361] provided you make use of them for a good
   purpose. For Paul himself recommends many; and this he would not have
   done had it been unlawful. Two things, however, are required here --
   first, that it be not a recommendation that is elicited by flattery,
   but an altogether unbiassed testimony; [362] and secondly, that it be
   not given for the purpose of procuring advancement for the individual,
   but simply that it may be the means of promoting the advancement of
   Christ's kingdom. For this reason, I have observed, that Paul has an
   eye to those who had assailed him with calumnies.

   2. Ye are our Epistle. There is no little ingenuity in his making his
   own glory hinge upon the welfare of the Corinthians. "So long as you
   shall remain Christians, I shall have recommendation enough. For your
   faith speaks my praise, as being the seal of my apostleship." (1
   Corinthians 9:2.)

   When he says -- written in our hearts, this may be understood in
   reference to Silvanus and Timotheus, and in that case the meaning will
   be: "We are not contented with this praise, that we derive from the
   thing itself. The recommendations, that others have, fly about before
   the eyes of men, but this, that we have, has its seat in men's
   consciences." It may also be viewed as referring in part to the
   Corinthians, in this sense: "Those that obtain recommendations by dint
   of entreaty, have not in the conscience what they carry about written
   upon paper, and those that recommend others often do so rather by way
   of favor than from judgment. We, on the other hand, have the testimony
   of our apostleship, on this side and on that, engraven on men's
   hearts."

   Which is known and read It might also be read -- "Which is known and
   acknowledged," owing to the ambiguity of the word anaginoskesai, [363]
   and I do not know but that the latter might be more suitable. I was
   unwilling, however, to depart from the common rendering, when not
   constrained to do so. Only let the reader have this brought before his
   view, that he may consider which of the two renderings is the
   preferable one. If we render it acknowledged, there will be an implied
   contrast between an epistle that is sure and of unquestionable
   authority, and such as are counterfeit. [364] And, unquestionably, what
   immediately follows, is rather on the side of the latter rendering, for
   he brings forward the Epistle of Christ, in contrast with those that
   are forged and pretended.

   3. Ye are the Epistle of Christ Pursuing the metaphor, he says that the
   Epistle of which he speaks was written by Christ, inasmuch as the faith
   of the Corinthians was his work. He says that it was ministered by him,
   as if meaning by this, that he had been in the place of ink and pen. In
   fine, he makes Christ the author and himself the instrument, that
   calumniators may understand, that it is with Christ that they have to
   do, if they continue to speak against him [365] with malignity. What
   follows is intended to increase the authority of that Epistle. The
   second clause, [366] however, has already a reference to the comparison
   that is afterwards drawn between the law and the gospel. For he takes
   occasion from this shortly afterwards, as we shall see, to enter upon a
   comparison of this nature. The antitheses here employed -- ink and
   Spirit, stones and heart -- give no small degree of weight to his
   statements, by way of amplification. For in drawing a contrast between
   ink and the Spirit of God, and between stones and heart, he expresses
   more than if he had simply made mention of the Spirit and the heart,
   without drawing any comparison.

   Not on tables of stone He alludes to the promise that is recorded in
   Jeremiah 31:31, and Ezekiel 37:26, concerning the grace of the New
   Testament.

   I will make, says he, a new covenant with them, not such as I had made
   with their fathers; but I will write my laws upon their hearts, and
   engrave them on their inward parts. Farther, I will take away the stony
   heart from the midst of thee, and will give thee a heart of flesh, that
   thou mayest walk in my precepts.
   (Ezekiel 36:26, 27.)

   Paul says, that this blessing was accomplished through means of his
   preaching. Hence it abundantly appears, that he is a faithful minister
   of the New Covenant -- which is a legitimate testimony in favor of his
   apostleship. The epithet fleshly is not taken here in a bad sense, but
   means soft and flexible, [367] as it is contrasted with stony, that is,
   hard and stubborn, as is the heart of man by nature, until it has been
   subdued by the Spirit of God. [368]

   2 Corinthians 3:4-11

   4. And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

   4. Fiduciam autem eiusmodi per Christum habemus erga Deum:

   5. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
   ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

   5. Non quod idonei simus ex nobis ad cogitandum quicquam, tanquam ex
   nobis: sed facultas nostra ex Deo est.

   6. Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of
   the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit
   giveth life.

   6. Qui nos fecit idoneos ministros Novi testamenti, [369] non literae,
   sed Spiritus: nam litera quidem occidit: Spiritus autem vivificat.

   7. But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
   was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
   behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory
   was to be done away:

   7. Quodsi ministerium mortis in literis insculptum in lapidibus fuit in
   gloria, ita ut non possent intueri filii Israel in faciem Mosis propter
   gloriam vultus eius, quae aboletur:

   8. How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?

   8. Quomodo non magis ministerium Spiritus erit in gloria?

   9. For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the
   ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

   9. Si enim ministerium damnationis, gloria: quomodo non magis abundet
   (vel, excellat) ministerium iustitiae in gloria?

   10. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect,
   by reason of the glory that excelleth.

   10. Etenim quod glorificatum fuit, in hac parte, non fuit glorificatum
   propter antecellentem gloriam.

   11. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
   remaineth is glorious.

   11. Si enim quod aboletur, per gloriam: multo magis quod manet, erit in
   gloria.


   4. And such confidence As it was a magnificent commendation, that Paul
   had pronounced to the honor of himself and his Apostleship, lest he
   should seem to speak of himself more confidently than was befitting, he
   transfers the entire glory to God, from whom he acknowledges that he
   has received everything that he has. "By this boasting," says he, "I
   extol God rather than myself, by whose grace I am what I am." (1
   Corinthians 15:10.) He adds, as he is accustomed to do by Christ,
   because he is, as it were, the channel, through which all God's
   benefits flow forth to us.

   5. Not that we are competent. [370] When he thus disclaims all merit,
   it is not as if he abased himself in merely pretended modesty, but
   instead of this, he speaks what he truly thinks. Now we see, that he
   leaves man nothing. For the smallest part, in a manner, of a good work
   is thought. In other words, [371] it has neither the first part of the
   praise, nor the second; and yet he does not allow us even this. As it
   is less to think than to will, how foolish a part do those act, who
   arrogate to themselves a right will, when Paul does not leave them so
   much as the power of thinking aught! [372] Papists have been misled by
   the term sufficiency, that is made use of by the Old Interpreter. [373]
   For they think to get off by acknowledging that man is not qualified to
   form good purposes, while in the mean time they ascribe to him a right
   apprehension of the mind, which, with some assistance from God, may
   effect something of itself. Paul, on the other hand, declares that man
   is in want, not merely of sufficiency of himself, (autarkeian,) but
   also of competency (hikanoteta,) [374] which would be equivalent to
   idoneitas (fitness), if such a term were in use among the Latins. He
   could not, therefore, more effectually strip man bare of every thing
   good. [375]

   6. Who hath made us competent. [376] He had acknowledged himself to be
   altogether useless. Now he declares, that, by the grace of God, he has
   been qualified [377] for an office, for which he was previously
   unqualified. From this we infer its magnitude and difficulty, as it can
   be undertaken by no one, that has not been previously prepared and
   fashioned for it by God. It is the Apostle's intention, also, to extol
   the dignity of the gospel. There is, at the same time, no doubt, that
   he indirectly exposes the poverty of those, who boasted in lofty terms
   of their endowments, while they were not furnished with so much as a
   single drop of heavenly grace.

   Not of the letter but of the spirit He now follows out the comparison
   between the law and the gospel, which he had previously touched upon.
   It is uncertain, however, whether he was led into this discussion, from
   seeing that there were at Corinth certain perverse [378] devotees of
   the law, or whether he took occasion from something else to enter upon
   it. For my part, as I see no evidence that the false apostles had there
   confounded the law and the gospel, I am rather of opinion, that, as he
   had to do with lifeless declaimers, who endeavored to obtain applause
   through mere prating, [379] and as he saw, that the ears of the
   Corinthians were captivated with such glitter, he was desirous to show
   them what was the chief excellence of the gospel, and what was the
   chief praise of its ministers. Now this he makes to consist in the
   efficacy of the Spirit. A comparison between the law and the gospel was
   fitted in no ordinary degree to show this. This appears to me to be the
   reason why he came to enter upon it.

   There is, however, no doubt, that by the term letter, he means the Old
   Testament, as by the term spirit he means the gospel; for, after having
   called himself a minister of the New Testament, he immediately adds, by
   way of exposition, that he is a minister of the spirit, and contrasts
   the letter with the spirit. We must now enquire into the reason of this
   designation. The exposition contrived by Origen has got into general
   circulation -- that by the letter we ought to understand the
   grammatical and genuine meaning of Scripture, or the literal sense, (as
   they call it,) and that by the spirit is meant the allegorical meaning,
   which is commonly reckoned to be the spiritual meaning. Accordingly,
   during several centuries, nothing was more commonly said, or more
   generally received, than this -- that Paul here furnishes us with a key
   for expounding Scripture by allegories, while nothing is farther from
   his intention. For by the term letter he means outward preaching, of
   such a kind as does not reach the heart; and, on the other hand, by
   spirit he means living doctrine, of such a nature as worketh
   effectually (1 Thessalonians 2:13) on the minds of men, [380] through
   the grace of the Spirit. By the term letter, therefore, is meant
   literal preaching -- that is, dead and ineffectual, perceived only by
   the ear. By the term spirit, on the other hand, is meant spiritual
   doctrine, that is, what is not merely uttered with the mouth, but
   effectually makes its way to the souls of men with a lively feeling.
   For Paul had an eye to the passage in Jeremiah, that I quoted a little
   ago, (Jeremiah 31:31,) where the Lord says, that his law had been
   proclaimed merely with the mouth, and that it had, therefore, been of
   short duration, because the people did not embrace it in their heart,
   and he promises the Spirit of regeneration under the reign of Christ,
   to write his gospel, that is, the new covenant, upon their hearts. Paul
   now makes it his boast, that the accomplishment of that prophecy is to
   be seen in his preaching, that the Corinthians may perceive, how
   worthless is the loquacity of those vain boasters, who make incessant
   noise [381] while devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit.

   It is asked, however, whether God, under the Old Testament, merely
   sounded forth in the way of an external voice, and did not also speak
   inwardly to the hearts of the pious by his Spirit. I answer in the
   first place, that Paul here takes into view what belonged peculiarly to
   the law; for although God then wrought by his Spirit, yet that did not
   take its rise from the ministry of Moses, but from the grace of Christ,
   as it is said in John 1:17 --

   The law was given by Moses;
   but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

   True, indeed, the grace of God did not, during all that time, lie
   dormant, but it is enough that it was not a benefit that belonged to
   the law. [382] For Moses had discharged his office, when he had
   delivered to the people the doctrine of life, adding threatenings and
   promises. For this reason he gives to the law the name of the letter,
   because it is in itself a dead preaching; but the gospel he calls
   spirit, because the ministry of the gospel is living, nay, lifegiving.

   I answer secondly, that these things are not affirmed absolutely in
   reference either to the law or to the gospel, but in respect of the
   contrast between the one and the other; for even the gospel is not
   always spirit. When, however, we come to compare the two, it is truly
   and properly affirmed, that the nature of the law is to teach men
   literally, in such a way that it does not reach farther than the ear;
   and that, on the other hand, the nature of the gospel is to teach
   spiritually, because it is the instrument of Christ's grace. This
   depends on the appointment of God, who has seen it meet to manifest the
   efficacy of his Spirit more clearly in the gospel than in the law, for
   it is his work exclusively to teach effectually the minds of men.

   When Paul, however, calls himself a Minister of the Spirit, he does not
   mean by this, that the grace of the Holy Spirit and his influence, were
   tied to his preaching, so that he could, whenever he pleased, breathe
   forth the Spirit along with the utterance of the voice. He simply
   means, that Christ blessed his ministry, and thus accomplished what was
   predicted respecting the gospel. It is one thing for Christ to connect
   his influence with a man's doctrine. [383] and quite another for the
   man's doctrine [384] to have such efficacy of itself. We are, then,
   Ministers of the Spirit, not as if we held him inclosed within us, or
   as it were captive -- not as if we could at our pleasure confer his
   grace upon all, or upon whom we pleased -- but because Christ, through
   our instrumentality, illuminates the minds of men, renews their hearts,
   and, in short, regenerates them wholly. [385] It is in consequence of
   there being such a connection and bond of union between Christ's grace
   and man's effort, that in many cases that is ascribed to the minister
   which belongs exclusively to the Lord. For in that case it is not the
   mere individual that is looked to, but the entire dispensation of the
   gospel, which consists, on the one hand, in the secret influence of
   Christ, and, on the other, in man's outward efforts.

   For the letter killeth. This passage was mistakingly perverted, first
   by Origen, and afterwards by others, to a spurious signification. From
   this arose a very pernicious error -- that of imagining that the
   perusal of Scripture would be not merely useless, but even injurious,
   [386] unless it were drawn out into allegories. This error was the
   source of many evils. For there was not merely a liberty allowed of
   adulterating the genuine meaning of Scripture, [387] but the more of
   audacity any one had in this manner of acting, so much the more eminent
   an interpreter of Scripture was he accounted. Thus many of the ancients
   recklessly played with the sacred word of God, [388] as if it had been
   a ball to be tossed to and fro. In consequence of this, too, heretics
   had it more in their power to trouble the Church; for as it had become
   general practice to make any passage whatever [389] mean anything that
   one might choose, there was no frenzy so absurd or monstrous, as not to
   admit of being brought forward under some pretext of allegory. Even
   good men themselves were carried headlong, so as to contrive very many
   mistaken opinions, led astray through a fondness for allegory.

   The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows -- that, if the
   word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an occasion of
   death, and that it is lifegiving, only when it is received with the
   heart. The terms letter and spirit, therefore, do not refer to the
   exposition of the word, but to its influence and fruit. Why it is that
   the doctrine merely strikes upon the ear, without reaching the heart,
   we shall see presently.

   7 But if the ministry of death. He now sets forth the dignity of the
   gospel by this argument -- that God conferred distinguished honor upon
   the law, which, nevertheless, is nothing in comparison with the gospel.
   The law was rendered illustrious by many miracles. Paul, however,
   touches here upon one of them merely -- that the face of Moses shone
   with such splendor as dazzled the eyes of all. That splendour was a
   token of the glory of the law. He now draws an argument from the less
   to the greater -- that it is befitting, that the glory of the gospel
   should shine forth with greater lustre, inasmuch as it is greatly
   superior to the law.

   In the first place, he calls the law the ministry of death. Secondly,
   he says, that the doctrine of it was written in letters, and with ink.
   Thirdly, that it was engraven on stones. Fourthly, that it was not of
   perpetual duration; but, instead of this, its condition was temporary
   and fading. And, fifthly, he calls it the ministry of condemnation. To
   render the antitheses complete, it would have been necessary for him to
   employ as many corresponding clauses in reference to the gospel; but,
   he has merely spoken of it as being the ministry of the Spirit, and of
   righteousness, and as enduring for ever. If you examine the words, the
   correspondence is not complete, but so far as the matter itself is
   concerned, what is expressed is sufficient. [390] For he had said that
   the Spirit giveth life, and farther, that men's hearts served instead
   of stones, and disposition, in the place of ink

   Let us now briefly examine those attributes of the law and the gospel.
   Let us, however, bear in mind, that he is not speaking of the whole of
   the doctrine that is contained in the law and the Prophets; and
   farther, that he is not treating of what happened to the fathers under
   the Old Testament, but merely notices what belongs peculiarly to the
   ministry of Moses. The law was engraven on stones, and hence it was a
   literal doctrine. This defect of the law required to be corrected by
   the gospel, because it could not but be brittle, so long as it was
   merely engraven on tables of stone. The gospel, therefore, is a holy
   and inviolable covenant, because it was contracted by the Spirit of
   God, acting as security. From this, too, it follows, that the law was
   the ministry of condemnation and of death; for when men are instructed
   as to their duty, and hear it declared, that all who do not render
   satisfaction to the justice of God are cursed, (Deuteronomy 27:26,)
   they are convicted, as under sentence of sin and death. From the law,
   therefore, they derive nothing but a condemnation of this nature,
   because God there demands what is due to him, and at the same time
   confers no power to perform it. The gospel, on the other hand, by which
   men are regenerated, and are reconciled to God, through the free
   remission of their sins, is the ministry of righteousness, and,
   consequently, of life also.

   Here, however, a question arises: As the gospel is the odor of death
   unto death to some, (2 Corinthians 2:16,) and as Christ is a rock of
   offense, and a stone of stumbling set for the ruin of many, [391] (Luke
   2:34; 1 Peter 2:8,) why does he represent, as belonging exclusively to
   the law, what is common to both? Should you reply, that it happens
   accidentally that the gospel is the source of death, and, accordingly,
   it the occasion of it rather than the cause, inasmuch as it is in its
   own nature salutary to all, the difficulty will still remain unsolved;
   for the same answer might be returned with truth in reference to the
   law. For we hear what Moses called the people to bear witness to --
   that he had set before them life and death. (Deuteronomy 30:15.) We
   hear what Paul himself says in Romans 7:10 -- that the law has turned
   out to our ruin, not through any fault attaching to it, but in
   consequence of our wickedness. Hence, as the entailing of condemnation
   upon men is a thing that happens alike to the law and the gospel, the
   difficulty still remains.

   My answer is this -- that there is, notwithstanding of this, a great
   difference between them; for although the gospel is an occasion of
   condemnation to many, it is nevertheless, on good grounds, reckoned the
   doctrine of life, because it is the instrument of regeneration, and
   offers to us a free reconciliation with God. The law, on the other
   hand, as it simply prescribes the rule of a good life, does not renew
   men's hearts to the obedience of righteousness, and denounces
   everlasting death upon transgressors, can do nothing but condemn. [392]
   Or if you prefer it in another way, the office of the law is to show us
   the disease, in such a way as to show us, at the same time, no hope of
   cure: the office of the gospel is, to bring a remedy to those that were
   past hope. For as the law leaves man to himself, it condemns him, of
   necessity, to death; while the gospel, bringing him to Christ, opens
   the gate of life. Thus, in one word, we find that it is an accidental
   property of the law, that is perpetual and inseparable, that it
   killeth; for as the Apostle says elsewhere, (Galatians 3:10,)

   All that remain under the law are subject to the curse.

   It does, not, on the other hand, invariably happen to the gospel, that
   it kills, for in it is

   revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith, and therefore it
   is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. (Romans
   1:17,18.) [393]

   It remains, that we consider the last of the properties that are
   ascribed. The Apostle says, that the law was but for a time, and
   required to be abolished, but that the gospel, on the other hand,
   remains for ever. There are various reasons why the ministry of Moses
   is pronounced transient, for it was necessary that the shadows should
   vanish at the coming of Christ, and that statement --

   The law and the Prophets were until John --
   (Matthew 11:13)

   -- applies to more than the mere shadows. For it intimates, that Christ
   has put an end to the ministry of Moses, which was peculiar to him, and
   is distinguished from the gospel. Finally, the Lord declares by
   Jeremiah, that the weakness of the Old Testament arose from this --
   that it was not engraven on men's hearts. (Jeremiah 31:32,33.) For my
   part, I understand that abolition of the law, of which mention is here
   made, as referring to the whole of the Old Testament, in so far as it
   is opposed to the gospel, so that it corresponds with the statement --
   The law and the Prophets were until John. For the context requires
   this. For Paul is not reasoning here as to mere ceremonies, but shows
   how much more powerfully the Spirit of God exercises his power in the
   gospel, than of old under the law.

   So that they could not look. He seems to have had it in view to
   reprove, indirectly, the arrogance of those, who despised the gospel as
   a thing that was excessively mean, [394] so that they could scarcely
   deign to give it a direct look. "So great," says he, "was the splendor
   of the law, that the Jews could not endure it. What, then, must we
   think of the gospel, the dignity of which is as much superior to that
   of the law, as Christ is more excellent than Moses?"

   10. What was rendered glorious. This is not a correction of what goes
   before, but rather a confirmation; for he means that the glory of the
   law is extinguished when the gospel comes forth. As the moon and stars,
   though in themselves they are not merely luminous, but diffuse their
   light over the whole earth, do, nevertheless, disappear before the
   brightness of the sun; so, however glorious the law was in itself, it
   has, nevertheless, no glory in comparison with the excellence of the
   gospel. Hence it follows, that we cannot sufficiently prize, or hold in
   sufficient esteem the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the
   gospel, like the splendor of the sun when beaming forth; and that the
   gospel is foolishly handled, nay more, is shamefully profaned, where
   the power and majesty of the Spirit do not come forth to view, so as to
   draw up men's minds and hearts heavenward.

   [375] Charnock, in his "Discourse on the Efficient of Regeneration,"
   makes an interesting allusion to Calvin's exposition of this verse.
   "Thinking," says he, "is the lowest step in the ladder of preparation;
   tis the first act of the creature in any rational production; yet this
   the Apostle doth remove from man, as in every part of it his own act,
   (2 Corinthians 3:5) Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
   any thing as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. The word
   signifies -- reasoning: no rational act can be done without reasoning;
   this is not purely our own. We have no sufficiency of ourselves, as of
   ourselves, originally and radically of ourselves, as if we were the
   author of that sufficiency, either naturally or meritoriously. And
   Calvin observes, that the word is not autarkeia, but hikanote" -- not a
   self ability, but an aptitude or fitness to any gracious thought. How
   can we oblige him by any act, since, in every part of it, it is from
   him, not from ourselves? For as thinking is the first requisite, so it
   is perpetually requisite to the progress of any rational act, so that
   every thought in any act, and the whole progress, wherein there must be

   [377] It is justly observed by Barnes, that the rendering in our
   authorized version -- "Who hath made us able ministers" -- "does not
   quite meet the force of the original," as it "would seem to imply that
   Paul regarded himself and his fellow -- laborers as men of talents, and
   of signal ability; and that he was inclined to boast of it," while
   instead of this "he did not esteem himself sufficient for this work in
   his own strength, (2 Corinthians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 3:5); and he here
   says, that God had made him sufficient: not able, talented, learned,
   but sufficient, (hikanosen hemas); he has supplied our deficiency; he
   has rendered us competent or fit; -- if a word may be coined after the
   manner of the Greek here, he has sufficienced us for this work.'" The
   unhappy rendering referred to had originated (as is shown by Granville
   Penn) in the circumstance, that the Vulgate having rendered the
   expression -- qui idoneos nos fecit ministros, Wiclif translated it as
   follows: which made us also able mynystris, and that, while Erasmus
   suggested that it should be rendered -- qui idoneos nos fecit ut
   essemus ministri, quasi dicas, idoneavit -- who fitted or qualified us
   to be ministers -- and while, besides, in the first translation from

   All Scripture is profitable in some way, some for doctrine, some for

   2 Corinthians 3:12-18

   12. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
   speech:

   12. Habentes igitur hanc spem, multa fiducia (vel, libertate) utimur.

   13. And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children
   of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is
   abolished:

   13. Et non quemadmodum Moses (Exodus 34:33-35) ponebat velamen ante
   faciem suam, ut non intuerentur filii Israel in finem eius quod
   aboletur. [395]

   14. But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same
   vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is
   done away in Christ.

   14. Sed excoecati sunt [396] sensus eorum: nam usque in hune diem
   velamen illud in lectione Veteris Testamenti [397] manet: nec tollitur,
   eo quod aboletur per Christum. [398]

   15. But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
   heart.

   15. Sed usque in hodiernum diem, quum legitur Moses, velamen eorum
   cordibus impositum est.

   16. Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
   taken away.

   16. At ubi conversus fuerit ad Dominum, auferetur velamen.

   17. Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
   there is liberty.

   17. Dominus Spiritus est: ubi autem Spiritus Domini, illic libertas.

   18. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
   Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
   the Spirit of the Lord.

   18. Nos autem omnes retecta facie gloriam Domini in speculo
   conspicientes, in eandem imaginem transformamur a gloria in gloriam,
   tanquam a Domini Spiritu.


   12. Having therefore this hope. Here he advances still farther, for he
   does not treat merely of the nature of the law, or of that enduring
   quality of which we have spoken, but also of its abuse. True, indeed,
   this also belonged to its nature, that, being covered with a veil, it
   was not so manifest to the eye, and that by its brightness it inspired
   terror, and accordingly Paul says elsewhere, what amounts to the same
   thing -- that the people of Israel had received from it the spirit of
   bondage unto fear. (Romans 8:15.) Here, however, he speaks rather of an
   abuse that was foreign and adventitious. [399] There was at that time
   in all quarters a grievous stumbling-block arising from the wantonness
   of the Jews, inasmuch as they obstinately rejected Christ. [400] In
   consequence of this, weak consciences were shaken, being in doubt,
   whether they should embrace Christ, inasmuch as he was not acknowledged
   by the chosen people. [401] This kind of scruple the Apostle removes,
   by instructing them, that their blindness had been prefigured even from
   the beginning, inasmuch as they could not behold the face of Moses,
   except through the medium of a veil. As, therefore, he had stated
   previously, that the law was rendered glorious by the lustre of Moses'
   countenance, so now he teaches, that the veil was an emblem of the
   blindness that was to come upon the people of Israel, for the person of
   Moses represents the law. The Jews, therefore, acknowledged by this,
   that they had not eyes to behold the law, except when veiled.

   This veil, he adds, is not taken away, except by Christ. From this he
   concludes, that none are susceptible of a right apprehension, but those
   who direct their minds to Christ. [402] In the first place, he draws
   this distinction between the law and the Gospel -- that the brightness
   of the former rather dazzled men's eyes, than enlightened them, while
   in the latter, Christ's glorious face is clearly beheld. He now
   triumphantly exults, on the ground that the majesty of the Gospel is
   not terrific, but amiable [403] -- is not hid, but is manifested
   familiarly to all. The term parresia confidence, he employs here,
   either as meaning an elevated magnanimity of spirit, with which all
   ministers of the Gospel ought to be endowed, or as denoting an open and
   full manifestation of Christ; and this second view is the more
   probable, for he contrasts this confidence with the obscurity of the
   law. [404]

   13. Not as Moses Paul is not reasoning as to the intention of Moses.
   For as it was his office, to publish the law to his people, so, there
   can be no doubt that he was desirous, that its true meaning should be
   apprehended by all, and that he did not intentionally involve his
   doctrine in obscurity, but that the fault was on the part of the
   people. As, therefore, he could not renew the minds of the hearers, he
   was contented with faithfully discharging the duty assigned to him. Nay
   more, the Lord having commanded him to put a veil between his face and
   the eyes of the beholders, he obeyed. Nothing, therefore, is said here
   to the dishonor of Moses, for he was not required to do more than the
   commission, that was assigned to him, called for. In addition to this,
   that bluntness, or that weak and obtuse vision, of which Paul is now
   speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively, because the law
   though wrapt up in figures, [405] did nevertheless impart wisdom to
   babes, Psalm 19:7 [406]

   14. Their understandings were blinded. He lays the whole blame upon
   them, inasmuch as it was owing to their blindness, that they did not
   make any proficiency in the doctrine of the law. He afterwards adds,
   That veil remaineth even until this day. By this he means, that that
   dulness of vision was not for a single hour merely, but prefigured what
   the condition of the nation would be in time to come. "That veil with
   which Moses covered his face, when publishing the law, was the emblem
   of a stupidity, that would come upon that people, and would continue
   upon them for a long period. Thus at this day, when the law is preached
   to them, in

   hearing they hear not, and in seeing they see not.
   (Matthew 13:13.)

   There is no reason, however, why we should be troubled,

   as though some new thing had happened. (1 Peter 4:12.)

   God has shown long ago under the type of the veil, that it would be so.
   Lest, however, any blame should attach to the law, he again repeats it,
   that their hearts were covered with a veil

   And it is not removed, because it is done away through Christ. He
   assigns a reason, why they are so long in blindness in the midst of
   light. For the law is in itself bright, but it is only when Christ.
   appears to us in it, that we enjoy its splendor. The Jews turn away
   their eyes as much as they can from Christ. It is not therefore to be
   wondered, if they see nothing, refusing as they do to behold the sun.
   This blindness on the part of the chosen people, especially as it is so
   long continued, admonishes us not to be lifted up with pride, relying
   on the benefits that God has conferred upon us. This point is treated
   of in Romans 11:20. Let, however, the reason of this blindness deter us
   from contempt of Christ, which God so grievously punishes. In the mean
   time, let us learn, that without Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
   (Malachi 4:2,) there is no light even in the law, or in the whole word
   of God.

   16. But when he shall have turned to the Lord. This passage has
   hitherto been badly rendered, for both Greek and Latin writers have
   thought that the word Israel was to be understood, whereas Paul is
   speaking of Moses. He had said, that a veil is upon the hearts of the
   Jews, when Moses is read. He immediately adds, As soon as he will have
   turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away. Who does not see, that
   this is said of Moses, that is, of the law? For as Christ is the end
   [407] of it, (Romans 10:4,) to which it ought to be referred, it was
   turned away in another direction, when the Jews shut out Christ from
   it. Hence, as in the law [408] they wander into by-paths, so the law,
   too, becomes to them involved like a labyrinth, until it is brought to
   refer to its end, that is, Christ. If, accordingly, the Jews seek
   Christ in the law, the truth of God will be distinctly seen by them,
   [409] but so long as they think to be wise without Christ, they will
   wander in darkness, and will never arrive at a right understanding of
   the law. Now what is said of the law applies to all Scripture -- that
   where it is not taken as referring to Christ as its one aim, it is
   mistakingly twisted and perverted. [410]

   17. The Lord is the Spirit. This passage, also, has been
   misinterpreted, as if Paul had meant to say, that Christ is of a
   spiritual essence, for they connect it with that statement in John
   4:24, God is a Spirit. The statement before us, however, has nothing to
   do with Christ's essence, but simply points out his office, for it is
   connected with what goes before, where we found it stated, that the
   doctrine of the law is literal, and not merely dead, but even an
   occasion of death. He now, on the other hand, calls Christ its spirit,
   [411] meaning by this, that it will be living and life-giving, only if
   it is breathed into by Christ. Let the soul be connected with the body,
   and then there is a living man, endowed with intelligence and
   perception, fit for all vital functions. [412] Let the soul be removed
   from the body, and there will remain nothing but a useless carcase,
   totally devoid of feeling.

   The passage is deserving of particular notice, [413] as teaching us, in
   what way we are to reconcile those encomiums which David pronounces
   upon the law -- (Psalm 19:7,8) -- "the law of the Lord converteth
   souls, enlighteneth the eyes, imparteth wisdom to babes," and passages
   of a like nature, with those statements of Paul, which at first view
   are at variance with them -- that it is the ministry of sin and death
   -- the letter that does nothing but kill. (2 Corinthians 3:6,7.) For
   when it is animated by Christ, [414] those things that David makes
   mention of are justly applicable to it. If Christ is taken away, it is
   altogether such as Paul describes. Hence Christ is the life of the law.
   [415]

   Where the Spirit of the Lord. He now describes the manner, in which
   Christ gives life to the law -- by giving us his Spirit. The term
   Spirit here has a different signification from what it had in the
   preceding verse. There, it denoted the soul, and was ascribed
   metaphorically to Christ. Here, on the other hand, it means the Holy
   Spirit, that Christ himself confers upon his people. Christ, however,
   by regenerating us, gives life to the law, and shows himself to be the
   fountain of life, as all vital functions proceed from man's soul.
   Christ, then, is to all (so to speak) the universal soul, not in
   respect of essence, but in respect of grace. Or, if you prefer it,
   Christ is the Spirit, because he quickens us by the life-giving
   influence of his Spirit. [416]

   He makes mention, also, of the blessing that we obtain from that
   source. "There," says he, "is liberty." By the term liberty I do not
   understand merely emancipation from the servitude of sin, and of the
   flesh, but also that confidence, which we acquire from His bearing
   witness as to our adoption. For it is in accordance with that statement
   --

   We have not again received the spirit of bondage, to fear, etc. (Romans
   8:15.)

   In that passage, the Apostle makes mention of two things -- bondage,
   and fear. The opposites of these are liberty and confidence. Thus I
   acknowledge, that the inference drawn from this passage by Augustine is
   correct -- that we are by nature the slaves of sin, and are made free
   by the grace of regeneration. For, where there is nothing but the bare
   letter of the law, there will be only the dominion of sin, but the term
   Liberty, as I have said, I take in a more extensive sense. The grace of
   the Spirit might, also, be restricted more particularly to ministers,
   so as to make this statement correspond with the commencement of the
   chapter, for ministers require to have another grace of the Spirit, and
   another liberty from what others have. The former signification,
   however, pleases me better, though at the same time I have no
   objection, that this should be applied to every one according to the
   measure of his gift. It is enough, if we observe, that Paul here points
   out the efficacy of the Spirit, which we experience for our salvation
   -- as many of us, as have been regenerated by his grace.

   18. But we all, with unveiled face. I know not how it had come into the
   mind of Erasmus, to apply to ministers exclusively, what is evidently
   common to all believers. The word katoptrizesthai, it is true, has a
   double signification among the Greeks, for it sometimes means to hold
   out a mirror to be looked into, and at other times to look into a
   mirror when presented. [417] The old interpreter, however, has
   correctly judged, that the second of these is the more suitable to the
   passage before us. I have accordingly followed his rendering. [418] Nor
   is it without good reason, that Paul has added a term of universality
   -- "We all," says he; for he takes in the whole body of the Church. It
   is a conclusion that suits well with the doctrine stated previously --
   that we have in the gospel a clear revelation from God. As to this, we
   shall see something farther in the fourth chapter.

   He points out, however, at the same time, both the strength of the
   revelation, and our daily progress. [419] For he has employed such a
   similitude to denote three things: first, That we have no occasion to
   fear obscurity, when we approach the gospel, for God there clearly
   discovers to us His face; [420] secondly, That it is not befitting,
   that it should be a dead contemplation, but that we should be
   transformed by means of it into the image of God; and, thirdly, that
   the one and the other are not accomplished in us in one moment, but we
   must be constantly making progress both in the knowledge of God, and in
   conformity to His image, for this is the meaning of the expression --
   from glory to glory

   When he adds, -- as by the Spirit of the Lord, he again reminds of what
   he had said -- that the whole excellence of the gospel depends on this,
   that it is made life-giving to us by the grace of the Holy Spirit. For
   the particle of comparison -- as, is not employed to convey the idea of
   something not strictly applicable, but to point out the manner.
   Observe, that the design of the gospel is this -- that the image of
   God, which had been effaced by sin, may be stamped anew upon us, and
   that the advancement of this restoration may be continually going
   forward in us during our whole life, because God makes his glory shine
   forth in us by little and little.

   There is one question that may be proposed here. "Paul says, that we
   behold God's face with an unveiled face, [421] while in the former
   Epistle we find it stated, that we do not, for the present, know God
   otherwise than through a mirror, and in an obscure manner." In these
   statements there is an appearance of contrariety. They are, however, by
   no means at variance. The knowledge that we have of God for the present
   is obscure and slender, in comparison with the glorious view that we
   shall have on occasion of Christ's last coming. At the same time, He
   presents Himself to us at present, so as to be seen by us, and openly
   beheld, in so far as is for our advantage, and in so far as our
   capacity admits of. [422] Hence Paul makes mention of progress being
   made, inasmuch as there will then only be perfection.

   CHAPTER 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 4:1-6

   1. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
   we faint not;

   1. Quamobrem habentes ministerium hoc, sicuti misericordiam sumus
   consequuti, non deficimus,

   2. But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
   craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by
   manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God.

   2. Sed reiicimus latebras dedecoris, non ambulantes in astutia, neque
   dolo tractantes sermonem Dei: sed manifestatione veritatis commendantes
   nos apud omnem conscientiam hominum coram Deo.

   3. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

   3. Si autem velatum est Evangelium nostrum: in iis qui pereunt velatum
   est.

   4. In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
   believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
   the image of God, should shine unto them.

   4. Quibus deus saeculi hujus excoecavit sensus: nempe infidelibus, ut
   ne illis resplendeat claritas Evangelii gloriæ Christi, qui est imago
   Dei invisibilis.

   5. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
   ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

   5. Non enim nosmet ipsos praedicamus, sed Iesum Christum Dominum; nos
   veto servos vestros propter Iesum.

   6. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
   shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
   of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

   6. Quoniam Deus qui iussit e tenebris lumen splendescere, idem illuxit
   in cordibus nostris ad illuminationem cognitionis gloriæ Dei in facie
   Iesu Christi.


   1. Having this ministry. He now returns to a commendation of himself
   personally, from which he had digressed into a general discussion, in
   reference to the dignity of the gospel. As, therefore, he has been
   treating of the nature of the gospel, so he now shows how faithful and
   upright a minister of it he is. He has previously shown, what is the
   true gospel of Christ. He now shows what he preaches to be such.
   "Having," says he, "this ministry" -- that ministry, the excellence of
   which he had extolled in terms so magnificent, and the power and
   usefulness of which he had so abundantly shown forth. Hence, in order
   that he may not seem to extol himself too much, he premises that it was
   not by his own efforts, or by his own merits, that he had reached such
   a pinnacle of honor, but had been led forward by the mercy of God
   exclusively. Now there was more implied in making the mercy of God the
   reason of his Apostleship, than if he had attributed it to the grace of
   God. We faint not [423] that is, we are not deficient in our duty,
   [424] so as not to discharge it with fidelity.

   2. But renounce the hidden things. While he commends his own sincerity,
   [425] he, on the other hand, indirectly reproves the false Apostles,
   who, while they corrupted by their ambition the genuine excellence of
   the gospel, were, nevertheless, desirous of exclusive distinction.
   Hence the faults, from which he declares himself to be exempt, he
   indirectly imputes to them. By the hidden things of disgrace, or
   concealments, some understand the shadows of the Mosaic law. Chrysostom
   understands the expression to mean the vain show, by which they
   endeavored to recommend themselves. I understand by it -- all the
   disguises, with which they adulterated the pure and native beauty of
   the gospel. For as chaste and virtuous women, satisfied with the
   gracefulness of natural beauty, do not resort to artificial adornings,
   while harlots never think themselves sufficiently adorned, unless they
   have corrupted nature, so Paul glories in having set forth the pure
   gospel, while others set forth one that was disguised, and covered over
   with unseemly additions. For as they were ashamed of the simplicity of
   Christ, or at least could not have distinction [426] from true
   excellencies of Apostles, they framed a new gospel, not unlike a
   profane philosophy, swelled up with empty bombast, while altogether
   devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit. Spurious ornaments of this
   nature, [427] by which the gospel is disfigured, he calls the
   concealments of disgrace, because the nakedness of those, who have
   recourse to concealments and disguises, must of necessity be
   dishonorable and disgraceful.

   As to himself, he says that he rejects or disdains disguises, because
   Christ's face, the more that it is seen opened up to view in his
   preaching, shines forth so much the more gloriously. I do not, however,
   deny, that he alludes at the same time to the veil of Moses, (Exodus
   34:33,) of which he had made mention, but he ascribes a quite different
   veil to the false Apostles. For Moses covered his face, because the
   excessive brightness of the glory of the law could not be endured by
   tender and blear eyes. They, [428] on the other hand, put on a veil by
   way of ornament. Besides, as they would be despicable, nay, infamous,
   if the simplicity of the gospel shone forth, they, on this account,
   hide their shame under ever so many cloaks and masks.

   Not walking in craftiness. There can be no doubt, that the false
   Apostles delighted themselves greatly in the craftiness that Paul
   reproves, as though it had been a distinguished excellence, as we see
   even at this day some, even of those who profess the gospel, who would
   rather be esteemed subtile than sincere, and sublime rather than solid,
   while in the mean time all their refinement is mere childishness. But
   what would you do? It delights them to have a name for acuteness, and
   they have, under that pretext, applause among the ignorant. [429] We
   learn, however, in what estimation Paul holds this appearance of
   excellence. Craftiness he declares to be unworthy of Christ's servants.

   As to what follows -- nor handling deceitfully -- I am not sure that
   this sufficiently brings out Paul's meaning; for the verb doloun does
   not so properly mean acting fraudulently, as what is called falsifying
   [430] as horse-jockeys [431] are wont to do. In this passage, at least,
   it is placed in contrast with upright preaching, agreeably to what
   follows.

   But by manifestation of the truth He claims to himself this praise --
   that he had proclaimed the pure doctrine of the gospel in simplicity
   and without disguise, and has the consciences of all as witnesses of
   this in the sight of God. As he has placed the manifestation of the
   truth in contrast with the disguised [432] doctrine of the sophists, so
   he appeals the decision to their consciences, and to the judgment-seat
   of God, whereas they abused the mistaken judgment of men, or their
   corrupt affection, and were not so desirous to be in reality worthy of
   praise as they were eager to appear so. Hence we infer, that there is a
   contrast here between the consciences of men and their ears. Let the
   servants of Christ, therefore, reckon it enough to have approved their
   integrity to the consciences of men in the sight of God, and pay no
   regard to the corrupt inclinations of men, or to popular applause.

   3. But if our gospel is hid It might have been an easy thing to pour
   calumny upon what he had said as to the clearness of his preaching,
   because he had many adversaries. That calumny he repels with stern
   authority, for he threatens all who do not acknowledge the power of his
   gospel, and warns them that this is a token of reprobation and ruin.
   "Should any one affirm that he does not perceive that manifestation of
   Christ of which I boast, he clearly shows himself, by this very token,
   to be a reprobate, [433] for my sincerity in the work of instructing
   [434] is clearly and distinctly perceived by all that have eyes. Those,
   therefore, from whom it is hid, must be blind, and destitute of all
   rational understanding." The sum is this -- that the blindness of
   unbelievers detracts nothing from the clearness of his gospel; for the
   sun is not less resplendent, that the blind do not perceive his light.
   [435]

   But some one will say that this applies equally to the law, for in
   itself it is a lamp [436] to guide our feet, (Psalm 119:105,)
   enlightens the eyes, (Psalm 19:8,) etc., and is hid only from those
   that perish. I answer that, when Christ is included in the law, the sun
   shines forth through the midst of the clouds, so that men have light
   enough for their use; but when Christ is disjoined from it, there is
   nothing left but darkness, or a false appearance of light, that dazzles
   men's eyes instead of assisting them. It is, however, a token of great
   confidence, that he ventures to regard as reprobates all that reject
   his doctrine. It is befitting, however, that all that would be looked
   upon as ministers of God's word should be endued with the like
   confidence, that with a fearless confidence they may unhesitatingly
   summon all the adversaries of their doctrine to the judgment-seat of
   God, that they may bring thence a sure condemnation.

   4. Whose minds the god of this world He intimates, that no account
   should be made of their perverse obstinacy. "They do not see," says he,
   "the sun at mid-day, because the devil has blinded their
   understandings." No one that judges rightly can have any doubt, that it
   is of Satan that the Apostle speaks. Hilary, as he had to do with
   Arians, who abused this passage, so as to make it a pretext for denying
   Christ's true divinity, while they at the same time confessed him to be
   God, twists the text in this way -- "God hath blinded the
   understandings of this world." In this he was afterwards followed by
   Chrysostom, with the view of not conceding to the Manicheans their two
   first principles. [437] What influenced Ambrose does not appear.
   Augustine had the same reason as Chrysostom, having to contend with the
   Manicheans.

   We see what the heat of controversy does in carrying on disputes. Had
   all those men calmly read Paul's words, it would never have occurred to
   any one of them to twist them in this way into a forced meaning; but as
   they were harassed by their opponents, they were more concerned to
   refute them, than to investigate Paul's meaning. But what occasion was
   there for this? For the subterfuge of the Arians was childish -- that
   if the devil is called the god of this world, the name of God, as
   applied to Christ, does not express a true, eternal, and exclusive
   divinity. For Paul says elsewhere, many are called gods, (1 Corinthians
   8:5;) but David, on the other hand, sings forth -- the gods of the
   nations are demons. [438] (Psalm 96:5.) When, therefore, the devil is
   called the god of the wicked, on the ground of his having dominion over
   them, and being worshipped by them in the place of God, what tendency
   has this to detract from the honor of Christ? And as to the Manicheans,
   this appellation gives no more countenance to the Manicheans, than when
   he is called the prince of this world. (John 14:30.) [439]

   There is, therefore, no reason for being afraid to interpret this
   passage as referring to the devil, there being no danger in doing so.
   For should the Arians come forward and contend, [440] that Christ's
   divine essence is no more proved from his having the appellation God
   applied to him, than Satan's is proved from its being applied to him, a
   cavil of this nature is easily refuted; for Christ is called God
   without any addition, [441] nay, he is called God blessed for ever.
   (Romans 9:5.) He is said to be that God who was

   in the beginning, before the creation of the world.
   (John 1:1-3.)

   The devil, on the other hand, is called the god of this world, in no
   other way than as Baal is called the god of those that worship him, or
   as the dog is called the god of Egypt. [442] The Manicheans, as I have
   said, for maintaining their delusion, have recourse to other
   declarations of Scripture, as well as this, but there is no difficulty
   in refuting those also. They contend not so much respecting the term,
   as respecting the power. As the power of blinding is ascribed to Satan,
   and dominion over unbelievers, they conclude from this that he is, from
   his own resources, the author of all evil, so as not to be subject to
   God's control -- as if Scripture did not in various instances declare,
   that devils, no less than the angels of heaven, are servants of God,
   each of them severally in his own manner. For, as the latter dispense
   to us God's benefits for our salvation, so the former execute his
   wrath. Hence good angels are called powers and principalities,
   (Ephesians 3:10,) but it is simply because they exercise the power
   given them by God. For the same reason Satan is the prince of this
   world, not as if he conferred dominion upon himself, or obtained it by
   his own right, or, in fine, exercised it at his own pleasure. On the
   contrary, he has only so much as the Lord allows him. Hence Scripture
   does not merely make mention of the good spirit of God, and good
   angels, but he also speaks of evil spirits of God. An evil spirit from
   God came upon Saul. (1 Samuel 16:14.) Again, chastisements through
   means of evil angels. (Psalm 78:49.)

   With respect to the passage before us, the blinding is a work common to
   God and to Satan, for it is in many instances ascribed to God; but the
   power is not alike, nor is the manner the same. I shall not speak at
   present as to the manner. Scripture, however, teaches that Satan blinds
   men, [443] not merely with God's permission, but even by his command,
   that he may execute his vengeance. Thus Ahab was deceived by Satan, (1
   Kings 22:21,) but could Satan have done this of himself? By no means;
   but having offered to God his services for inflicting injury, he was
   sent to be a

   lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
   (1 Kings 22:22.)

   Nay more, the reason why God is said to blind men is, that after having
   deprived us of the right exercise of the understanding, and the light
   of his Spirit, he delivers us over to the devil, to be hurried forward
   by him to a reprobate mind, (Romans 1:28,) gives him the power of
   deception, and by this means inflicts just vengeance upon us by the
   minister of his wrath. Paul's meaning, therefore, is, that all are
   possessed by the devil, who do not acknowledge his doctrine to be the
   sure truth of God. For it is more severe to call them slaves of the
   devil, [444] than to ascribe their blindness to the judgment of God.
   As, however, he had a little before adjudged such persons to
   destruction, (2 Corinthians 4:3,) he now adds that they perish, for no
   other reason than that they have drawn down ruin upon themselves, as
   the effect of their own unbelief.

   Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine upon them.
   This serves to confirm what he had said -- that if any one rejected his
   gospel, it was his own blindness that prevented him from receiving it.
   "For nothing," says he, "appears in it but Christ, and that not
   obscurely, but so as to shine forth clearly." He adds, that Christ is
   the image of God, by which he intimates that they were utterly devoid
   of the knowledge of God, in accordance with that statement --

   He that knoweth not me knoweth not my Father.
   (John 14:7.)

   This then is the reason, why he pronounced so severe a sentence upon
   those that had doubts as to his Apostleship -- because they did not
   behold Christ, who might there be distinctly beheld. It is doubtful
   whether he employed the expression, the gospel of the glory of Christ,
   as meaning the glorious gospel, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom; or
   whether he means by it -- the gospel, in which Christ's glory shone
   forth. The second of these meanings I rather prefer, as having in it
   more completeness.

   When, however, Christ is called the image of the invisible God, this is
   not meant merely of his essence, as being the "co-essential of the
   Father," as they speak, [445] but rather has a reference to us, because
   he represents the Father to us. The Father himself is represented as
   invisible, because he is in himself not apprehended by the human
   understanding. He exhibits himself, however, to us by his Son, and
   makes himself in a manner visible. [446] I state this, because the
   ancients, having been greatly incensed against the Arians, insisted
   more than was befitting on this point -- how it is that the Son is
   inwardly the image of the Father by a secret unity of essence, while
   they passed over what is mainly for edification -- in what respects he
   is the image of God to us, when he manifests to us what had otherwise
   been hid in him. Hence the term image has a reference to us, as we
   shall see again presently [447] The epithet invisible, though omitted
   in some Greek manuscripts, I have preferred to retain, as it is not
   superfluous. [448]

   5. For we preach not ourselves Some make this to be an instance of
   Zeugma, [449] in this manner: We preach not ourselves to be lords, but
   God's only Son, whom the Father has set over all things, to be the one
   Lord. [450] I do not, indeed, find fault with that interpretation, but
   as the expression is more emphatic (emphatikotera) and has a more
   extensive signification, [451] when it is said, that one preaches
   himself. I am more inclined to retain this interpretation, especially
   as it is almost unanimously approved of. For there are other ways in
   which men preach themselves, than by arrogating to themselves dominion,
   as for example, when they aim at show, rather than at edification --
   when they are desirous in any way to have distinction -- when, farther,
   they make gain of the gospel. Ambition, therefore, and avarice, and
   similar vices in a minister, taint the purity of his doctrine, so that
   Christ has not there the exclusive distinction. Hence, he that would
   preach Christ alone, must of necessity forget himself.

   And ourselves your servants. Lest any one should mutter out the
   objection--"But in the mean time you say many things respecting
   yourself," he answers, that he desires nothing farther, than that he
   should be their servant. "Whatever things I declare respecting myself
   (so loftily, and boastfully, in your opinion) have this object in view
   -- that I may in Christ serve you advantageously." It follows, that the
   Corinthians are excessively proud and ungrateful, if they reject this
   condition. Nay more, it follows, that they had been previously of a
   corrupt judgment, inasmuch as they had not perceived his holy
   affection.

   Here, however, all pastors of the Church are admonished as to their
   state and condition, for by whatever title of honor they may be
   distinguished, they are nothing more than the servants of believers,
   and unquestionably, they cannot serve Christ, without serving his
   Church at the same time. An honorable servitude, it is true, this is,
   and superior to any principality, [452] but still it is a servitude, so
   that Christ alone may be elevated to distinction -- not encumbered by
   the shadow of a single rival [453] Hence it is the part of a good
   pastor, not merely to keep aloof from all desire of domineering, but to
   regard it as the highest pitch of honor, at which he aspires -- that he
   may serve the people of God. It is the duty of the people, on the other
   hand, to esteem the servants of Christ first of all on the ground of
   the dignity of their Master, and then farther on account of the dignity
   and excellence of their office, that they may not despise those, whom
   the Lord has placed in so illustrious a station.

   6. God who commanded light to shine out of darkness. I see that this
   passage may be explained in four different ways. In the first place
   thus: "God has commanded light to shine forth out of darkness: that is,
   by the ministry of men, who are in their own nature darkness, He has
   brought forward the light of His gospel into the world." Secondly,
   thus: "God has made the light of the gospel to take the place of the
   law, which was wrapt up in dark shadows, and thus, He has brought light
   out of darkness." Those that are fond of subtleties, would be prepared
   readily to receive expositions of that sort, but any one, who will
   examine the matter more closely, will perceive, that they do not
   correspond with the Apostle's intention. The third exposition is that
   of Ambrose: "When all things were involved in darkness, God kindled up
   the light of His gospel. For mankind were sunk in the darkness of
   ignorance, when God on a sudden shone forth upon them by his gospel."
   The fourth is that of Chrysostom, who is of opinion, that Paul alluded
   to the creation of the world, in this way: "God, who by his word
   created light, drawing it, as it were, out of the darkness [454] --
   that same Being has now enlightened us in a spiritual manner, when we
   were buried in darkness." This transition, [455] from light that is
   visible and corporeal to what is spiritual, has more of elegance, and
   there is nothing forced in it. The preceding one, [456] however, is not
   unsuitable. Let every one follow his own judgment.

   Hath shined in our hearts. He speaks of a twofold illumination, which
   must be carefully observed -- the one is that of the gospel, the other
   is secret, taking place in our hearts. [457] For as God, the Creator of
   the world, pours forth upon us the brightness of the sun, and gives us
   eyes to receive it, so, as the Redeemer, in the person of his Son, He
   shines forth, indeed, upon us by His gospel, but, as we are blind, that
   would be in vain, if He did not at the same time enlighten our
   understandings by His Spirit. His meaning, therefore, is, that God has,
   by His Spirit, opened the eyes of our understandings, so as to make
   them capable of receiving the light of the gospel.

   In the face of Jesus Christ. In the same sense in which he had
   previously said that Christ is the image of the Father, (2 Corinthians
   4:4) he now says, that the glory of God is manifested to us in his
   face. Here we have a remarkable passage, from which we learn that God
   is not to be sought out (Job 11:7) in His unsearchable height,

   (for He dwells in light that is inaccessible, 1 Timothy 6:16,)

   but is to be known by us, in so far as He manifests himself in Christ.
   Hence, whatever men desire to know respecting God, apart from Christ,
   is evanescent, for they wander out of the way. True, indeed, God in
   Christ appears in the first instance to be mean, but he appears at
   length to be glorious in the view of those, who hold on, so as to come
   from the cross to the resurrection. [458] Again we see, that in the
   word person [459] there is a reference made to us, [460] because it is
   more advantageous for us to behold God, as He appears in His
   only-begotten Son, than to search out His secret essence.

   [423] Instead of ouk ekkakoumen, we faint not, enkakoumen, we act not
   wickedly, is the reading of ADFG, and some others. Wakefield thinks it
   the genuine reading; it certainly makes a very good sense with what
   goes before and what follows. If we follow this reading, the whole
   verse may be read thus -- Wherefore, as we have obtained mercy, or been
   graciously entrusted, eleethemen, with this ministry, we do not act
   wickedly, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty." -- Dr.
   A. Clarke. -- Ed.

   [424] "Nous n'omettons rien de ce qui est de nostre office;" -- "We do
   not omit any thing of what belongs to our office."

   sincerity."

   [426] "Ne pouuoyent pas estre excellens et en estime;" -- "Could not be

   [430] The verb doloun is applied by Lucian (in Hermot. 59) to vintners
   adulterating wine, in which sense it is synonymous with kapeleuein,
   made use of by Paul in 2 Corinthians 2:17. Beza's rendering of the
   clause exactly corresponds with the one to which Calvin gives the
   preference -- "Neque falsantes sermonem Dei;" -- "Nor falsifying the
   word of God." Tyndale (1534) renders the clause thus -- "Nether
   corrupte we the worde of God." The rendering in the Rheims version
   (1582) is -- "Nor adulterating the word of God." -- Ed.

   [431] "Et frippiers;" -- "And brokers."

   [436] "Vne lanterne ardente;" -- "A lantern burning."

   [437] The Manicheans, so called from Manes their founder, held the
   doctrine of two first principles, a good and an evil, thinking to
   account in this way for the origin of evil. See Calvin's Institutes,
   volume 1 -- Ed.

   [438] "Les dieux des Gentils sont diables;" -- "The gods of the
   Gentiles are devils." Calvin here, as in many other instances, quotes
   according to the sense, not according to the words. The passage
   referred to is rendered by Calvin -- "All the gods of the nations are
   vanities," ("ou, idoles," "or idols,") the Hebrew word being, as he
   notices, 'lylym, (elilim,) mere nothings, (1 Corinthians 8:4,) instead
   of 'lhym, (elohim,) gods. (See Calvin on the Psalms, [29]vol. 4, pp.
   50, 51.) There can be no doubt that Calvin, in quoting this passage
   here, has an eye to what is stated by Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:20. --
   Ed.

   [439] Calvin, when commenting on the passage referred to, remarks, that
   "the devil is called the prince of this world, not because he has a
   kingdom separated from God, (as the Manicheans imagined,) but because,
   by God's permission, he exercises his tyranny over the world." --
   Calvin on John, [30]volume 2. -- Ed.

   [440] "Tant qu'ils voudront;" -- "As much as they please"

   [441] Calvin obviously means by this clause -- without anything being
   added having a tendency to qualify or limit the appellation. In
   accordance with this he says in the Institutes, (volume 1,) that the
   "title," God, "is not conferred on any man without some addition, as
   when it is said that Moses would be a god to Pharaoh." (Exodus 7:1.) --
   Ed.

   [442] A variety of animals, besides the dog, were worshipped by the
   Egyptians, and even some vegetable substances, growing in their
   gardens, were adored by them as deities! Calvin, when commenting on 1
   Corinthians 8:5, speaks of the Egyptians as having rendered divine
   homage to "the ox, the serpent, the cat, the onion, the garlic." --
   Calvin on Corinthians, [31]vol. 1, p. 277. -- Ed.

   [443] "Les reprouuez;" -- "The reprobate."

   [444] "The god of this world. O that we could consider this, according
   to what it doth import and carry in it of horror and detestableness! It
   is a thing that we do not yet believe, that a world inhabited by
   reasonable creatures, God's own offspring, is universally fallen into a
   confederacy and combination with another god, with an enemy -- god, an
   adversary -- god, against the living and true God! Men have changed
   their God. And what a fearful choice have they made! Fallen into a
   league with those wicked creatures that were weary of his government
   before, and that were, thereupon, thrown down into an abyss of
   darkness, and bound up in the chains thereof, unto the judgment of the
   great day. But doth the Scripture say this in vain? or hath it not a
   meaning when it calls the devil the god of this world? O with what
   amazement should it strike our hearts, to think that so it is, that the
   whole order of creatures is gone off from God, and fallen into a
   confederacy with the devil and his angels, against their rightful
   sovereign Lord." -- Howe's Works. (London, 1834.) p. 1206. -- Ed.

   [445] Calvin manifestly refers to an expression made use of by the
   Council of Nice, A.D. 325, to express unity of essence in the first and
   second persons of the Trinity, the Son having been declared to be
   homoousis to Patri -- co-essential with the Father. "It had been used
   in the same sense by some writers before the meeting of the Council. It
   is remarkable, however, that it had been rejected by the Council of
   Antioch, A.D. 263, on account of the inference which Paul of Samosata
   pretended to draw from it, namely, that if Christ and the Spirit were
   consubstantial with the Father, it followed that there were three
   substances -- one prior and two posterior -- derived from it. To guard
   against this inference, the Council declared that the Son was not
   homoousios to Patri (consubstantial with the Father.) "Paul" (of
   Samosata) "seems to have explained the term as signifying specific, or
   of the same species; and it is certain that this sense had sometimes
   been given to it. Thus Aristotle calls the stars homoousia meaning that
   they were all of the same nature. But in the creed of Nice it is
   expressive of unity of essence, and was adopted, after considerable
   discussion, as proper to be opposed to the Arians, who affirmed that
   the essence of the Son was different and separate from the Father." --
   Dick's Theology, volume 2. The reader will also find the same
   expression largely treated of by Calvin in the Institutes, volume 1 --
   1. See also Institutes, volume 2, and Calvin on John, [32]vol. 1, p.
   417. -- Ed.

   [446] "Christ is the image of God, as a child is the image of his
   father; not in regard of the individual property which the Father hath
   distinct from the child, and the child from the father, but in respect
   of the same substance and nature, derived from the father by
   generation. Christ is here called the image of God, (2 Corinthians
   4:4,) not so much,' saith Calvin, in relation to God, as the Father is
   the exemplar of his beauty and excellency, as in relation to us, as he
   represents the Father to us in the perfections of his nature, as they
   respect us and our welfare, and renders him visible to the eyes of our
   minds." -- Charnock's Works, (Lond. 1684,) volume 2, p. 476. -- Ed.

   2 Corinthians 4:7-12

   7. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of
   the power may be of God, and not of us.

   7. Habemus autem thesaurum hunc in vasis testaceis: ut exsuperantia
   potentira sit Dei, et non ex nobis:

   8. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
   but not in despair;

   8. Quando in omnibus premimur, at non anxii reddimur: laboramus inopia,
   at non destituimur:

   9. Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

   9. Persequutionem patimur, at non deserimur: deiicimur, at non
   perlinus:

   10. Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
   the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

   10. Semper mortificationem Iesu Christi circumferentes in corpore
   nostro, ut vita Iesu manifestetur in corpore nostro.

   11. For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
   that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

   11. Semper enim nos, dum vivimus, [461] in mortera tradimur propter
   Iesum, ut vita Iesu manifestetur [462] in mortali carne nostra.

   12. So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

   12. Itaque mors quidem in nobis operatur, vita autem in vobis. [463]


   7. But we have this treasure. Those that heard Paul glorying in such a
   magnificent strain as to the excellence of his ministry, and beheld, on
   the other hand, his person, contemptible and abject in the eyes of the
   world, might be apt to think that he was a silly and ridiculous person,
   and might look upon his boasting as childish, while forming their
   estimate of him from the meanness of his person. [464] The wicked, more
   particularly, caught hold of this pretext, when they wished to bring
   into contempt every thing that was in him. What, however, he saw to be
   most of all unfavorable to the honor of his Apostleship among the
   ignorant, he turns by an admirable contrivance into a means of
   advancing it. First of all, he employs the similitude of a treasure,
   which is not usually laid up in a splendid and elegantly adorned chest,
   but rather in some vessel that is mean and worthless; [465] and then
   farther, he subjoins, that the power of God is, by that means, the more
   illustrated, and is the better seen. "Those, who allege the
   contemptible appearance of my person, with the view of detracting from
   the dignity of my ministry, are unfair and unreasonable judges, for a
   treasure is not the less valuable, that the vessel, in which it is
   deposited, is not a precious one. Nay more, it is usual for great
   treasures to be laid up in earthen pots. Farther, they do not consider,
   that it is ordered by the special Providence of God, that there should
   be in ministers no appearance of excellence, lest any thing of
   distinction should throw the power of God into the shade. As,
   therefore, the abasement of ministers, and the outward contempt of
   their persons give occasion for glory accruing to God, that man acts a
   wicked part, who measures the dignity of the gospel by the person of
   the minister."

   Paul, however, does not speak merely of the universal condition of
   mankind, but of his own condition in particular. It is true, indeed,
   that all mortal men are earthen vessels Hence, let the most eminent of
   them all be selected, and let him be one that is adorned to admiration
   with all ornaments of birth, intellect, and fortune, [466] still, if he
   be a minister of the gospel, he will be a mean and merely earthen
   depository of an inestimable treasure Paul, however, has in view
   himself, and others like himself, his associates, who were held in
   contempt, because they had nothing of show.

   8. While we are pressed on every side. This is added by way of
   explanation, for he shows, that his abject condition is so far from
   detracting from the glory of God, that it is the occasion of advancing
   it. "We are reduced," says he, "to straits, but the Lord at length
   opens up for us an outlet; [467] we are oppressed with poverty, but the
   Lord affords us help. Many enemies are in arms against us, but under
   God's protection we are safe. In fine, though we are brought low, so
   that it might seem as if all were over with us, [468] still we do not
   perish." The last is the severest of all. You see, how he turns to his
   own advantage every charge that the wicked bring against him. [469]

   10. The mortification of Jesus [470] He says more than he had done
   previously, for he shows, that the very thing that the false apostles
   used as a pretext for despising the gospel, was so far from bringing
   any degree of contempt upon the gospel, that it tended even to render
   it glorious. For he employs the expression -- the mortification of
   Jesus Christ -- to denote everything that rendered him contemptible in
   the eyes of the world, with the view of preparing him for participating
   in a blessed resurrection. In the first place, the sufferings of
   Christ, [471] however ignominious they may be in the eyes of men, have,
   nevertheless, more of honor in the sight of God, than all the triumphs
   of emperors, and all the pomp of kings. The end, however, must also be
   kept in view, that we suffer with him, that we may be glorified
   together with him. (Romans 8:17.) Hence he elegantly reproves the
   madness of those, who made his peculiar fellowship with Christ a matter
   of reproach. At the same time, the Corinthians are admonished to take
   heed, lest they should, while haughtily despising Paul's mean and
   abject appearance, do an injury to Christ himself, by seeking an
   occasion of reproach [472] in his sufferings, which it becomes us to
   hold in the highest honor.

   The word rendered mortification, [473] is taken here in a different
   sense from what it bears in many passages of Scripture. For it often
   means self-denial, when we renounce the lusts of the flesh, and are
   renewed unto obedience to God. Here, however, it means the afflictions
   by which we are stirred up to meditate on the termination of the
   present life. To make the matter more plain, let us call the former the
   inward mortification, and the latter the outward. Both make us
   conformed to Christ, the one directly, the other indirectly, so to
   speak. Paul speaks of the former in Colossians 3:5, and in Romans 6:6,
   where he teaches that

   our old man is crucified, that we may walk in newness of life

   He treats of the second in Romans 8:29, where he teaches, that we were
   predestinated by God to this end -- that we might be conformed to the
   image of his Son. It is called, however, a mortification of Christ only
   in the case of believers, because the wicked, in the endurance of the
   afflictions of this present life, share with Adam, but the elect have
   participation with the Son of God, so that all those miseries that are
   in their own nature accursed, are helpful to their salvation. All the
   sons of God, it is true, have this in common, that they bear about the
   mortification, of Christ; [474] but, according as any one is
   distinguished by a larger measure of gifts, he, in that proportion,
   comes so much the nearer to conformity with Christ in this respect.

   That the life of Jesus. Here is the best antidote to adversity -- that
   as Christ's death is the gate of life, so we know that a blessed
   resurrection will be to us the termination of all miseries, [475]
   inasmuch as Christ has associated us with himself on this condition,
   that we shall be partakers of his life, if in this world we submit to
   die with him.

   The sentence that immediately follows may be explained in two ways. If
   you understand the expression delivered unto death as meaning to be
   incessantly harassed with persecutions and exposed to dangers, this
   would be more particularly applicable to Paul, and those like him, who
   were openly assailed by the fury of the wicked. And thus the
   expression, for Jesus' sake, will be equivalent to for the testimony of
   Christ. (Revelation 1:9.) As, however, the expression to be daily
   delivered unto death, means otherwise -- to have death constantly
   before our eyes, and to live in such a manner, that our life is rather
   a shadow of death, [476] I have no objection, that this passage, also,
   should be expounded in such a way as to be applicable to all believers,
   and that, too, to every one in his order. Paul himself, in Romans 8:36,
   explains in this manner Psalm 44:22. In this way for Christ's sake
   would mean -- because this condition is imposed upon all his members.
   Erasmus, however, has rendered it, with not. so much propriety, we who
   live. The rendering that I have given is more suitable -- while we
   live. For Paul means that, so long as we are in the world, we resemble
   the dead rather than the living.

   12. Hence death indeed. This is said ironically, because it was
   unseemly that the Corinthians should live happily, and in accordance
   with their desire, and that they should, free from anxiety, take their
   ease, while in the mean time Paul was struggling with incessant
   hardships. [477] Such an allotment would certainly have been
   exceedingly unreasonable. It was also necessary that the folly of the
   Corinthians should be reproved, inasmuch as they contrived to
   themselves a Christianity without the cross, and, not content with
   this, held in contempt the servants of Christ, because they were not so
   effeminate. [478] Now as death denotes all afflictions, or a life full
   of vexations, so also life denotes a condition that is prosperous and
   agreeable; agreeably to the maxim: "Life is -- not to live, but to be
   well." [479]

   round about it. That is the sort of trouble which that word in its
   primary signification holds forth to us, and which the circumstances of
   the text declare to be the signification of the thing here meant. [...]
   The word stenochoroumenoi expresseth such a kind of straitening as doth
   infer a difficulty of drawing breath; that a man is so compressed, that
   he cannot tell how to breathe. That is the native import of the word.

   [468] "There is an allusion," says Dr. Bloomfield, "to an army so

   [469] "Pour le rendre contemptible;" -- "To render him contemptible."

   [470] "Mortificationem." -- Such is Calvin's rendering of the original
   term nekrosin, and it is evidently employed to convey the idea of
   putting to death, the main idea intended to be expressed being, as our
   author shows, that the apostles were, for the sake of Christ, subjected
   to humiliating and painful sufferings, which gave them, in a manner, an
   outward conformity to their Divine Master in the violent death
   inflicted upon him. The term mortification, when taken in strict
   accordance with its etymology, in the sense of putting to death,
   appears to bring out more fully the apostle's meaning, than the word
   "dying," made use of in our authorized version. Beza, who gives the
   same rendering as Calvin, subjoins the following valuable observations:
   -- "Mortificationem ten nekrosin -- Sic vocat Paulus miseram illam
   conditionem fidelium, ac pr'sertim ministrorum (de his enim proprie
   agitur) qui quotidie (ut ait David) occiduntur, quasi destinationem ad
   coedem dicas: additurque Domini Iesu, vel, (ut legit vetus interpres)
   Iesu Christi, tum ut declaretur causa propter quam mundus illos ita
   persequitur; tum etiam quia hac quoque in parte Christo capiti sunt
   conformes, Christusque adeo ipse quodammodo in iis morte afficitur.
   Ambrosius maluit mortem interpretari, nempe quia in altero membro sit
   mentio vitoe Christi. At ego, si libuisset a Pauli verbis discedere,
   coedem potius exposuissem: quia non temere Paulus sekrosin maluit
   scribere quam thanaton, quoniam etiam Christus hic considerandus nobis
   est non ut simpliciter mortuus, sed ut interemptus. Verum ut modo dixi
   nekrosis nec mortem nec coedem hic significat, sed conditionem illam
   quotidianis mortibus obnoxiam, qualis etiam fuit Christi ad tempus;" --
   "Mortification ten nekrosin This term Paul makes use of to denote that
   miserable condition of believers, and more especially of ministers,
   (for it is of them properly that he speaks,) who are, as David says,
   killed every day -- as though you should say a setting apart for
   slaughter; and it is added -- of the Lord Jesus, or (as the old
   interpreter renders it) of Jesus Christ, partly with the view of
   explaining the reason why the world thus persecutes them, and partly
   because in this respect also they are conformed to Christ, the Head,
   and even Christ himself is, in them, in a manner put to death. Ambrose
   has preferred to render it death, for this reason, that in the other
   clause mention is made of the life of Christ. For my own part, however,
   were I to depart from Paul's words, I would rather render it slaughter,
   inasmuch as Paul did not rashly make use of nekrosin rather than
   thanaton, since Christ also is to be viewed by us here, not simply as
   having died, but as having been put to death. But, as I said a little
   ago, nekrosis here does not mean death nor slaughter, but a condition
   which exposed every day to deaths, such as Christ's, also, was for a
   time." -- Ed.

   [471] By the "sufferings of Christ," here, Calvin obviously means --
   not the sufferings of our Redeemer personally, but sufferings endured
   for Christ in the persons of his members, as in Colossians 1:24. -- Ed.

   [472] "Matiere d'opprobre et deshonneur;" -- "Matter of reproach and
   dishonor."

   [473] Wiclif (1380) renders the expression as follows: "euermore we
   beren aboute the sleyng of Ihesus in oure bodi." -- Ed.

   [474] "Here we have a strong mode of expressing the mortal peril to
   which he was continually exposed; (as in 1 Corinthians 15:31, kath '
   hemeran apothnesko, I die daily,) together with an indirect comparison
   of the sufferings endured by himself and the other apostles, with those
   endured by the Lord Jesus even unto death. The genitive tou Kuriou (of
   the Lord,) is, as Grotius remarks, a genitive of likeness. The sense is
   -- bearing about -- continually sustaining, perils and sufferings, like
   those of the Lord Jesus.'" -- Bloomfield, -- Ed.

   [475] "La fin et l'issue de toutes miseres et calamitez;" -- "The end
   and issue of all miseries and calamities."

   [476] Calvin manifestly alludes to the expression which occurs in
   Psalms 23:4, the valley of the shadow of death, which he explains in a
   metaphorical sense, as denoting deep afflication. -- See Calvin on the
   Psalms, [35]vol. 1, pp. 394-396. -- Ed.

   [477] "Eust ... combatre contre tant de miseres et calamitez;" -- "Had
   to struggle against so many miseries and calamities."

   [478] "Comme eux;" -- "As they."

   2 Corinthians 4:13-18

   13. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
   believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore
   speak;

   13. Habentes autem eundem Spiritum fidei, quemadmodum scriptum est
   (Psalm 116:10) Credidi, propterea loquutus sum: nos quoque credimus,
   ideo et loquimur:

   14. Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us
   also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

   14. Scientes, quod qui suscitavit Dominum Iesum, nos etiam cum Iesu
   suscitabit, et constituet vobiscum.

   15. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
   through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

   15. Nam omnia propter vos, ut gratia quæ abundaverit propter gratiarum
   actionem, quæ a multis proficiscetur, abundet in gloriam Dei.

   16. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
   yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

   16. quamobrem non deficimus: verum etsi externus homo noster
   corrumpitur, noster internus renovatur de die in diem.

   17. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
   a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

   17. Levitas enim afflictionis nostrae supramodum momentanea, [480]
   mternum supramodum pondus glorim operatur in nobis (vel, motentatea
   levitas operatur in excellentia excellenter.)

   18. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
   which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
   things which are not seen are eternal.

   18. Dum non spectamus ea quæ videntur, sed quæ non videntur: nam quae
   videntur, temporaria sunt: quæ autem non videntur, æterna.


   13. Having the same spirit. This is a correction of the foregoing
   irony. He had represented the condition of the Corinthians as widely
   different from his own, (not according to his own judgment, but
   according to their erroneous view,) inasmuch as they were desirous of a
   gospel that was pleasant and free from all molestation of the cross,
   and entertained less honorable views of him, because his condition was
   less renowned. Now, however, he associates himself with them in the
   hope of the same blessedness. "Though God spares you, and deals with
   you more indulgently, while he treats me with somewhat more severity,
   this diversity, nevertheless, will be no hinderance in the way of the
   like glorious resurrection awaiting both of us. For where there is
   oneness of faith, there will, also, there be one inheritance." It has
   been thought, that the Apostle speaks here of the holy fathers, who
   lived under the Old Testament, and represents them as partakers with
   us, in the same faith. This, indeed, is true, but it does not accord
   with the subject in hand. For it is not Abraham, or the rest of the
   fathers, that he associates with himself in a fellowship of faith, but
   rather the Corinthians, whereas they separated themselves from him by a
   perverse ambition. "However my condition," says he, "may appear to be
   the worse for the present, we shall, nevertheless, one day be alike
   participants in the same glory, for we are connected together by one
   faith." Whoever will examine the connection attentively, will perceive,
   that this is the true and proper interpretation. By metonymy, he gives
   the name of the spirit of faith [481] to faith itself, because it is a
   gift of the Holy Spirit.

   As it is written What has given occasion for the mistake [482] is, that
   he quotes the testimony of David. It ought, however, to be taken in
   connection with the confession -- not with the oneness of faith, or if
   you prefer it, it agrees with what follows -- not with what goes
   before, in this way: "Because we have an assured hope of a blessed
   resurrection, we are bold to speak and preach what we believe, as it is
   written, I believed, therefore have I spoken " Now, this is the
   commencement of Psalm 116, [483] where David acknowledges, that, when
   he had been reduced to the last extremity, he was so overpowered that
   he almost gave way, but, having soon afterwards regained confidence, he
   had overcome that temptation. Accordingly, he opens the Psalm thus: I
   believed, therefore will I speak. For faith is the mother [484] of
   confession. Paul, it is true, stirring himself up to imitate him, [485]
   exhorts the Corinthians to do the same, and, in accordance with the
   common Greek translation, has used the preterite instead of the future,
   but this is of no consequence [486] For he simply means to say, that
   believers ought to be magnanimous, and undaunted, in

   confessing [487] what they have believed with their heart.
   (Romans 10:9, 10.)

   Let now our pretended followers of Nicodemus [488] mark, what sort of
   fiction they contrive for themselves in the place of faith, when they
   would have faith remain inwardly buried, and altogether silent, and
   glory in this wisdom -- that they utter, during their whole life, not a
   single word of right confession.

   15. For all things are for your sakes He now associates himself with
   the Corinthians, not merely in the hope of future blessedness, but also
   in these very afflictions, in which they might seem to differ from him
   most widely, for he lets them know, that, if he is afflicted, it is for
   their benefit. Hence it follows, that there was good reason why they
   should transfer part of them to themselves. What Paul states, depends
   first of all on that secret fellowship, which the members of Christ
   have with one another, but chiefly on that mutual connection and
   relationship, which required more especially to be manifested among
   them. Now this admonition was fraught with great utility to the
   Corinthians, and brought with it choice consolation. For what
   consolation there is in this -- that while God, sparing our weakness,
   deals with us more gently, those that are endowed with more
   distinguished excellence, are afflicted for the common advantage of
   all! They were also admonished, that, since they could not aid Paul
   otherwise, they should, at least, help him by their prayers and
   sympathy.

   That the grace which hath abounded. That agreement [489] between the
   members of Christ he now commends on the ground of the fruit that
   springs from it -- its tendency to advance the glory of God. By a
   metonymy, according to his usual manner, he means, by the term grace,
   that blessing of deliverance, of which he had made mention previously
   -- that,

   while he was weighed down, he was, nevertheless, not in anxiety: while
   oppressed with poverty, he was not left destitute, etc.,
   (2 Corinthians 4:8, 9,)

   and in fine, that he had a deliverance continually afforded him from
   every kind of evil [490] This grace, he says, overflows. By this he
   means, that it was not confined to himself personally, so that he alone
   enjoys it, but it extends itself farther -- namely, to the Corinthians,
   to whom it was of great advantage. When he makes the overflowing of
   God's gift consist in gratitude, tending to the glory of its Author, he
   admonishes us, that every blessing that God confers upon us perishes
   through our carelessness, if we are not prompt and active in rendering
   thanks.

   16. For which cause we faint not [491] He now, as having carried his
   point, rises to a higher confidence than before. "There is no cause,"
   says he, "why we should lose heart, or sink down under the burden of
   the cross, the issue of which is not merely so desirable to myself, but
   is also salutary to others." Thus he exhorts the Corinthians to
   fortitude by his own example, should they happen at any time to be
   similarly afflicted. Farther, he beats down that insolence, in which
   they in no ordinary degree erred, inasmuch as under the influence of
   ambition, they held a man in higher estimation, the farther he was from
   the cross of Christ.

   Though our outward man. The outward man, some improperly and ignorantly
   confound with the old man, for widely different from this is the old
   man, of which we have spoken in [36]Romans 4:6. Chrysostom, too, and
   others restrict it entirely to the body; but it is a mistake, for the
   Apostle intended to comprehend, under this term, everything that
   relates to the present life. As he here sets before us two men, so you
   must place before your view two kinds of life -- the earthly and the
   heavenly. The outward man is the maintenance of the earthly life, which
   consists not merely in the flower of one's age, (1 Corinthians 7:36,)
   and in good health, but also in riches, honors, friendships, and other
   resources. [492] Hence, according as we suffer a diminution or loss of
   these blessings, which are requisite for keeping up the condition of
   the present life, is our outward man in that proportion corrupted. For
   as we are too much taken up with the present life, so long as
   everything goes on to our mind, the Lord, on that account, by taking
   away from us, by little and little, the things that we are engrossed
   with, calls us back to meditate on a better life. Thus, therefore, it
   is necessary, that the condition of the present life should decay,
   [493] in order that the inward man may be in a flourishing state;
   because, in proportion as the earthly life declines, does the heavenly
   life advance, at least in believers. For in the reprobate, too, the
   outward man decays, [494] but without anything to compensate for it. In
   the sons of God, on the other hand, a decay of this nature is the
   beginning, and, as it were, the cause of production. He says that this
   takes place daily, because God continually stirs us up to such
   meditation. Would that this were deeply seated in our minds, that we
   might uninterruptedly make progress amidst the decay of the outward
   man!

   17. Momentary lightness. As our flesh always shrinks back from its own
   destruction, whatever reward may be presented to our view, and as we
   are influenced much more by present feeling than by the hope of
   heavenly blessings, Paul on that account admonishes us, that the
   afflictions and vexations of the pious have little or nothing of
   bitterness, if compared with the boundless blessings of everlasting
   glory. He had said, that the decay of the outward man ought to occasion
   us no grief, inasmuch as the renovation of the inward man springs out
   of it. As, however, the decay is visible, and the renovation is
   invisible, Paul, with the view of shaking us off from a carnal
   attachment to the present life, draws a comparison between present
   miseries and future felicity. Now this comparison is of itself
   abundantly sufficient for imbuing the minds of the pious with patience
   and moderation, that they may not give way, borne down by the burden of
   the cross. For whence comes it, that patience is so difficult a matter
   but from this, -- that we are confounded on having experience of evils
   for a brief period, [495] and do not raise our thoughts higher? Paul,
   therefore, prescribes the best antidote against your sinking down under
   the pressure of afflictions, when he places in opposition to them that
   future blessedness which is laid up for thee in heaven. (Colossians
   1:5.) For this comparison makes that light which previously seemed
   heavy, and makes that brief and momentary which seemed of boundless
   duration.

   There is some degree of obscurity in Paul's words, for as he says, With
   hyperbole unto hyperbole, [496] so the Old Interpreter, and Erasmus
   [497] have thought that in both terms the magnitude of the heavenly
   glory, that awaits believers is extolled; or, at least, they have
   connected them with the verb worketh out. To this I have no objection,
   but as the distinction that I have made is also not unsuitable, I leave
   it to my readers to make their choice.

   Worketh out an eternal weight Paul does not mean, that this is the
   invariable effect of afflictions; for the great majority are most
   miserably weighed down here with evils of every kind, and yet that very
   circumstance is an occasion of their heavier destruction, rather than a
   help to their salvation. As, however, he is speaking of believers, we
   must restrict exclusively to them what is here stated; for this is a
   blessing from God that is peculiar to them -- that they are prepared
   for a blessed resurrection by the common miseries of mankind.

   As to the circumstance, however, that Papists abuse this passage, to
   prove that afflictions are the causes of our salvation, it is
   exceedingly silly; [498] unless, perhaps, you choose to take causes in
   the sense of means, (as they commonly speak.) We, at least, cheerfully
   acknowledge, that

   we must through many tribulations [499]
   enter into the kingdom of heaven, (Acts 14:22,)

   and as to this there is no controversy. While, however, our doctrine
   is, that the momentary lightness of afflictions worketh out in us an
   eternal weight [500] of life, for this reason, that all the sons of God
   are

   predestinated to be conformed to Christ, (Romans 8:29,)

   in the endurance of the cross, and in this manner are prepared for the
   enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance, which they have through means of
   God's gracious adoption; Papists, on the other hand, imagine that they
   are meritorious works, [501] by which the heavenly kingdom is acquired.

   I shall repeat it again in a few words. We do not deny that afflictions
   are the path by which the heavenly kingdom is arrived at, but we deny
   that by afflictions we merit the inheritance, [502] which comes to us
   in no other way than through means of God's gracious adoption. Papists,
   without consideration, seize hold of one little word, with the view of
   building upon it a tower of Babel, (Genesis 11:9,) -- that the kingdom
   of God is not an inheritance procured for us by Christ, but a reward
   that is due to our works. For a fuller solution, however, of this
   question, consult my Institutes. [503]

   While we look not. Mark what it is, that will make all the miseries of
   this world easy to be endured, -- if we carry forward our thoughts to
   the eternity of the heavenly kingdom. For a moment is long, if we look
   around us on this side and on that; but, when we have once raised our
   minds heavenward, a thousand years begin to appear to us to be like a
   moment. Farther, the Apostle's words intimate, that we are imposed upon
   by the view of present things, because there is nothing there that is
   not temporal; and that, consequently, there is nothing for us to rest
   upon but confidence in a future life. Observe the expression, looking
   at the things which are unseen, [504] for the eye of faith penetrates
   beyond all our natural senses, and faith is also on that account
   represented as a looking at things that are invisible. (Hebrews 11:1.)

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 5:1-8

   1. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
   dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens.

   1. Scimus enim, quod, si terrenum nostrum domicilium destruatur,
   aedificationem ex Deo habemus, domum non manufactam, aeternam in
   coelis.

   2. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our
   house which is from heaven:

   2. Etenim in hoc gemimus, domicilium nostrum quod est e coelo,
   superinduere desiderantes:

   3. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

   3. Siquidem etiam vestiti, non nudi reperiamur. [505]

   4. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for
   that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
   swallowed up of life.

   4. Etenim dum sumus in tabernaculo, gemimus gravati; eo quod non exui
   volumus, [506] sed superindui, ut destruatur, quod mortale est, a vita.

   5. Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also
   hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

   5. Qui autem aptavit nos ad hoc ipsum, Deus est: qui etiam dedit nobis
   arrhabonem Spiritus.

   6. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
   home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

   6. Confidimus ergo semper, et scimus, quod habitantes in corpore,
   peregrinamur a Domino.

   7. (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

   7. Per fidem enim ambulamus, et non per aspectum.

   8. We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the
   body, and to be present with the Lord.

   8. Confidimus, inquam, et libentius optamus peregrinari a corpore, et
   habitare apud Dominum.


   1. For we know. Here follows an amplification (epexergasia) or
   embellishment of the foregoing statement. [507] For Paul has it in
   view, to correct in us impatience, dread, and dislike of the cross,
   contempt for what is mean, and in fine, pride, and effeminacy; and this
   can only be accomplished by raising up our minds as high as heaven,
   through contempt of the world. Now he has recourse to two arguments. On
   the one hand, he shows the miserable condition of mankind in this life,
   and on the other hand, the supreme and perfect blessedness, which
   awaits believers in heaven after death. For what is it that keeps men
   so firmly bound in a misplaced attachment to this life, but their
   deceiving themselves with a false imagination -- thinking themselves
   happy in living here? On the other hand, it is not enough to be aware
   of the miseries of this life, if we have not at the same time in view
   the felicity and glory of the future life. This is common to good and
   bad alike -- that both are desirous to live. This, also, is common to
   both -- that, when they consider, how many and how great miseries they
   are here exposed to, (with this difference, however, that unbelievers
   know of no adversities but those of the body merely, while the pious
   are more deeply affected [508] by spiritual distresses,) they often
   groan, often deplore their condition, and desire a remedy for their
   evils. As, however, all naturally view death with horror, unbelievers
   never willingly quit this life, except when they throw it off in
   disgust or despair. Believers, on the other hand, depart willingly,
   because they have a better hope set before them beyond this world. This
   is the sum of the argument. Let us now examine the words one by one.

   We know, says he. This knowledge does not spring from the human
   intellect, but takes its rise from the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
   Hence it is peculiar to believers. Even the heathens had some idea of
   the immortality of the soul, but there was not one of them, that had
   assurance of it -- not one of them could boast that he spoke of a thing
   that was known to him. [509] Believers alone can affirm this, [510] to
   whom it has been testified of by the word and Spirit of God.

   Besides, it is to be observed, that this knowledge is not merely of a
   general kind, as though believers were merely in a general way
   persuaded, that the children of God will be in a better condition after
   death, and had no assurance as to themselves individually, [511] for of
   how very little service this would be for affording a consolation, so
   difficult of attainment! On the contrary, every one must have a
   knowledge peculiar to himself, for this, and this only, can animate me
   to meet death with cheerfulness -- if I am fully persuaded, that I am
   departing to a better life.

   The body, such as we now have it, he calls a house of tabernacle For as
   tabernacles [512] are constructed, for a temporary purpose, of slight
   materials, and without any firm foundation, and then shortly afterwards
   are thrown down, or fall of their own accord, so the mortal body is
   given to men as a frail hut, [513] to be inhabited by them for a few
   days. The same metaphor is made use of, also, by Peter in his Second
   Epistle, (2 Peter 1:13, 14,) and by Job, (Job 4:19,) when he calls it a
   house of clay. He places in contrast with this a building of perpetual
   duration. It is not certain, whether he means by this term a state of
   blessed immortality, which awaits believers after death, or the
   incorruptible and glorious body, such as it will be after the
   resurrection. In whichever of these senses it is taken, it will not be
   unsuitable; though I prefer to understand it as meaning, that the
   blessed condition of the soul after death is the commencement of this
   building, and the glory of the final resurrection is the consummation
   of it. [514] This exposition will correspond better with the Apostle's
   context. The epithets, which he applies to this building, tend to
   confirm more fully its perpetuity.

   3. Since clothed He restricts to believers, what he had stated
   respecting the certainty of a future life, as it is a thing peculiar to
   them. For the wicked, too, are stripped of the body, but as they bring
   nothing within the view of God, but a disgraceful nakedness, they are,
   consequently, not clothed with a glorious body. Believers, on the other
   hand, who appear in the view of God, clothed with Christ, and adorned
   with His image, receive the glorious robe of immortality. For I am
   inclined to take this view, rather than that of Chrysostom and others,
   who think that nothing new is here stated, but that Paul simply repeats
   here, what he had previously said as to putting on an eternal
   habitation. The Apostle, therefore, makes mention here of a twofold
   clothing, with which God invests us -- the righteousness of Christ, and
   sanctification of the Spirit in this life; and, after death,
   immortality and glory. The first is the cause of the second, because

   those whom God has determined to glorify, he first justifies. (Romans
   8:30.)

   This meaning, too, is elicited from the particle also, which is without
   doubt introduced for the purpose of amplifying -- as if Paul had said,
   that a new robe will be prepared for believers after death, since they
   have been clothed in this life also.

   4. We groan, being burdened, because we desire not to be unclothed. The
   wicked, too, groan, because they are not contented with their present
   condition; but afterwards an opposite disposition prevails, that is, a
   clinging to life, so that they view death with horror, and do not feel
   the long continuance of this mortal life to be a burden. The groaning
   of believers, on the other hand, arises from this -- that they know,
   that they are here in a state of exile from their native land, and that
   they know, that they are here shut up in the body as in a prison. Hence
   they feel this life to be a burden, because in it they cannot enjoy
   true and perfect blessedness, because they cannot escape from the
   bondage of sin otherwise than by death, and hence they aspire to be
   elsewhere.

   As, however, it is natural for all animals to desire existence, how can
   it be, that believers are willing to cease to exist? The Apostle solves
   this question, when he says, that believers do not desire death for the
   sake of losing any thing, but as having regard to a better life. At the
   same time, the words express more than this. For he admits, that we
   have naturally an aversion to the quitting of this life, considered in
   itself, as no one willingly allows himself to be striped of his
   garments. Afterwards, however, he adds, that the natural horror of
   death is overcome by confidence; [515] as an individual will, without
   any reluctance, throw away a coarse, dirty, threadbare, and, in one
   word, tattered garment, with the view of his being arrayed in an
   elegant, handsome, new, and durable one.

   Farther, he explains the metaphor by saying --

   that what is mortal may be destroyed [516] by life. For as flesh and
   blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
   (1 Corinthians 15:50,)

   it is necessary, that what is corruptible in our nature should perish,
   in order that we may be thoroughly renewed, and restored to a state of
   perfection. On this account, our body is called a prison, in which we
   are confined.

   5. Now he that hath fitted us. This is added in order that we may know,
   that this disposition is supernatural. For mere natural feeling will
   not lead us forward to this, for it does not comprehend that
   hundredfold recompense which springs from the dying of a single grain.
   (John 12:24.) We must, therefore, be fitted for it by God. The manner
   of it is at the same time subjoined -- that he confirms us by his
   Spirit, who is as it were an earnest At the same time the particle also
   seems to be added for the sake of amplification. "It is God who forms
   in us this desire, and, lest our courage should give way or waver, the
   Holy Spirit is given us as an earnest, because by his testimony he
   confirms, and ratifies the truth of the promise." For these are two
   offices of the Holy Spirit -- first, to show to believers what they
   ought to desire, and secondly, to influence their hearts efficaciously,
   and remove all their doubt, that they may steadfastly persevere in
   choosing what is good. There would, however, be nothing unsuitable in
   extending the word fitted, so as to denote that renovation of life,
   with which God adorns his people even in this life, for in this way he
   already separates them from others, and shows that they are, by means
   of his grace, marked out for a peculiar condition.

   6. Therefore we are always confident That is, as exercising dependence
   on the earnest of the Spirit; for, otherwise, we always tremble, or, at
   least, are courageous or alarmed by turns, and do not retain a uniform
   and even tenor of mind. Hence, that good courage of which Paul speaks
   has no place in us, unless it is maintained by the Spirit of God. The
   connecting particle and, which immediately follows, ought to be
   understood as meaning because, in this way: We are of good courage,
   Because we know that we are absent, etc. For this knowledge is the
   cause of our calmness and confidence; for the reason, why unbelievers
   are constantly in a ferment of anxiety, or obstinately murmur against
   God, is, that they think they will ere long cease to exist, and they
   place in this life the highest and uppermost summit of their felicity.
   [517] We, on the other hand, live in the exercise of contentment, [518]
   and go forward to death with alacrity, [519] because a better hope is
   laid up for us.

   We are absent from the Lord Scripture everywhere proclaims, that God is
   present with us: Paul here teaches, that we are absent from him. This
   is seemingly a contradiction; but this difficulty is easily solved,
   when we take into view the different respects, in which he is said to
   be present or absent. He is, then, present with all men, inasmuch as he
   upholds them by his power. He dwells in them, because

   in him they live and move and have their being.
   (Acts 17:28.)

   He is present with his believing people by the energy of his Spirit; he
   lives in them, resides in the midst of them, nay more, within them. But
   in the mean time he is absent from us, inasmuch as he does not present
   himself to be seen face to face, because we are as yet in a state of
   exile from his kingdom, and have not as yet attained that blessed
   immortality, which the angels that are with him enjoy. At the same
   time, to be absent, in this passage, refers merely to knowledge, as is
   manifest from the reason that is afterwards added.

   7. For we walk by faith (Eidos) I have here rendered aspectum, (sight,)
   because few understood the meaning of the word species, (appearance.)
   [520] He states the reason, why it is that we are now absent from the
   Lord -- because we do not as yet see him face to face. (1 Corinthians
   13:12.) The manner of that absence is this -- that God is not openly
   beheld by us. The reason why he is not seen by us is, that we walk by
   faith Now it is on good grounds that faith is opposed to sight, because
   it, perceives those things that are hid from the view of men -- because
   it reaches forth to future things, which do not as yet appear. For such
   is the condition of believers, that they resemble the dead rather than
   the living -- that they often seem as if they were forsaken by God --
   that they always have the elements of death shut up within them. Hence
   they must necessarily hope against hope. (Romans 4:18.) Now the things
   that are hoped for are hid, as we read in Romans 8:24, and faith is the

   manifestation of things which do not appear.
   (Hebrews 11:1.) [521]

   It is not to be wondered, then, if the apostle says, that we have not
   as yet the privilege of sight, so long as we walk by faith For we see,
   indeed, but it is through a glass, darkly; (1 Corinthians 13:12,) that
   is, in place of the reality we rest upon the word.

   8. We are confident, I say He again repeats, what he had said
   respecting the confidence of the pious -- that they are so far from
   breaking down under the severity of the cross, and from being
   disheartened by afflictions, that they are made thereby more
   courageous. For the worst of evils is death, yet believers long to
   attain it, as being the commencement of perfect blessedness. Hence and
   may be regarded as equivalent to because, in this way: "Nothing can
   befall us, that can shake our confidence and courage, since death
   (which others so much dread) is to us great gain. (Philippians 1:21.)
   For nothing is better than to quit the body, that we may attain near
   intercourse with God, and may truly and openly enjoy his presence.
   Hence by the decay of the body we lose nothing that belongs to us."

   Observe here -- what has been once stated already -- that true faith
   begets not merely a contempt of death, but even a desire for it, [522]
   and that it is, accordingly, on the other hand, a token of unbelief,
   when dread of death predominates in us above the joy and consolation of
   hope. Believers, however, desire death -- not as if they would, by an
   importunate desire, anticipate their Lord's day, for they willingly
   retain their footing in their earthly station, so long as their Lord
   may see good, for they would rather live to the glory of Christ than
   die to themselves, (Romans 14:7,) and for their own advantage; [523]
   for the desire, of which Paul speaks, springs from faith. Hence it is
   not at all at variance with the will of God. We may, also, gather from
   these words of Paul, that souls, when released from the body, live in
   the presence of God, for if, on being absent from the body, they have
   God present, [524] they assuredly live with him.

   Here it is asked by some -- "How then did it happen that the holy
   fathers dreaded death so much, as for example David, Hezekiah, and the
   whole of the Israelitish Church, as appears from Psalm 4, from Isaiah
   38:3, and from Psalm 115:17?" I am aware of the answer, that is usually
   returned -- that the reason, why death was so much dreaded by them was,
   that the revelation of the future life was as yet obscure, and the
   consolation, consequently, was but small. Now I acknowledge, that this,
   in part, accounts for it, but not entirely, for the holy fathers of the
   ancient Church did not in every case tremble, on being forewarned of
   their death. Nay more, they embraced death with alacrity, and with
   joyful hearts. For Abraham departed without regret, full of days. [525]
   (Genesis 25:8.) We do not read that Isaac was reluctant to die.
   (Genesis 35:29.) Jacob, with his last breath, declares that he is

   waiting for the salvation of the Lord. (Genesis 49:18.)

   David himself, too, dies peacefully, without any regrets, (1 Kings
   2:10,) and in like manner Hezekiah. As to the circumstance, that David
   and Hezekiah did, each of them, on one occasion deprecate death with
   tears, the reason was, that they were punished by the Lord for certain
   sins, and, in consequence of this, they felt the anger of the Lord in
   death. Such was the cause of their alarm, and this believers might feel
   even at this day, under the reign of Christ. The desire, however, of
   which Paul speaks, is the disposition of a well-regulated mind. [526]

   [509] Cicero, who argues at considerable length, and as it might seem
   most convincingly, for the immortality of the soul, introduces one as
   complaining that while, on reading the arguments in favor of this
   tenet, he thought himself convinced, as soon as he laid aside the book
   and began to reason with himself, his conviction was gone. "I know
   not," says he, "how it happens, that when I read, I assent, but when I
   have laid down the book, all that assent vanishes." Hence Seneca, (Ep.
   102,) when speaking of the reasonings of the ancient heathen
   philosophers on this important point, justly observes, that
   "immortality, however desirable, was rather promised than proved by
   those great men." -- Ed.

   this Greek word." Those interpreters who have rendered eidos species,
   (appearance,) employ the word species to mean what is seen, as
   distinguished from what is invisible -- what has a visible form. The
   term, however, (as Calvin hints,) is ambiguous, being frequently
   employed to denote appearance, as distinguished from reality. -- Ed.

   [521] "Concerning the import of the original term hupostasis,
   translated substance, (Hebrews 11:1,) there has been a good deal of
   discussion, and it has been understood to signify confidence or
   subsistence. Faith is the confidence of things hoped for; because it
   assures us, not only that there are such things, but that, through the
   power and faithfulness of God, we shall enjoy them. It is the
   subsistence of things hoped for; because it gives them, although
   future, a present subsistence in the minds of believers, so that they
   are influenced by them as if they were actually present. Thus the word
   was understood by some of the Greek commentators, who were the most
   competent judges of its meaning. Since things which we hope for,' says
   Chrysostom, seem not to subsist, faith gives them subsistence, or
   rather it does not give it, but is itself their substance. Thus the
   resurrection of the dead is not past, nor does it subsist, but faith
   gives it subsistence in our souls.' Faith,' says another, gives
   subsistence to the resurrection of the dead, and places it before our
   eyes...' The objects of faith are not only future good, but invisible
   things, both good and evil, which are made known by divine revelation;
   and of these it is the evidence, elenchos the demonstration or
   conviction... Being past, and future, and invisible on account of their
   distance from us, or the spirituality of their nature, they cannot be
   discovered by our senses, but the conviction of their reality is as
   strong in the mind of a believer, as if they were placed before his
   eyes." -- Dick's Theology, volume 3. -- Ed.

   [523] "C'est ... dire pour leur propre proufit et vtilite;" -- "That is

   [524] "In this world," says Howe, in a discourse on 2 Corinthians 5:8,
   "we find ourselves encompassed with objects that are suitable,
   grateful, and entertaining to our bodily senses, and the several
   principles, perceptions, and appetites that belong to the bodily life;
   and these things familiarize and habituate us to this world, and make
   us, as it were, one with it. There is particularly a bodily people, as
   is intimated in the text, that we are associated with, by our being in
   the body. The words endemosai and ekdemosai, in this verse, (and the
   same are used in 2 Corinthians 5:6 and 9,) signify there is such a
   people of which we are, and from which we would be disassociated;
   endemos is civis, incola, or indigena -- an inhabitant or native among
   this or that people; an ekdemos is peregrinus, one that lives abroad,
   and is severed from the people he belonged unto. The apostle considers
   himself, while in the body, as living among such a sort of people as
   dwell in bodies, a like sort of people to himself, and would be no
   longer a home -- dweller with them, but travel away from them, to join
   and be a dweller with another people. For also, on the other hand, he
   considers, with the Lord,' an invisible world where he resides, and an
   incorporeal people he presides over." -- Howe's Works, (Lond. 1834,) p.
   1023. -- Ed.

   [525] "Rassassi de iours, et sans regret;" -- "Satisfied with days and
   without regret." "In the Hebrew," says Poole in his Annotations, "it is
   only full or satisfied; but you must understand with days or years, as
   the phrase is fully expressed in Genesis 35:29; 1 Chronicles 23:1; 1
   Chronicles 29:28; Job 42:17; Jeremiah 6:11. When he (Abraham) had lived
   as long as he desired, being in some sort weary of life, and desirous
   to be dissolved, or full of all good, as the Chaldee renders it --

   children." -- Ed.

   2 Corinthians 5:9-12

   9. Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
   accepted of him.

   9. Quapropter contendimus, sive domi agentes, sive foris peregrinantes,
   ut illi placeamus.

   10. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
   every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he
   hath done, whether it be good or bad.

   10. Omnes enim nos manifestari [527] oportet coram tribunali Christi,
   ut reportet unusquisque, quæ per corpus facta fuerint, prout fecerit,
   sive bonum, sive malum. [528]

   11. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we
   are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your
   consciences.

   11. Scientes igitur terrorem illum Domini, suademus hominibus, [529]
   Deo autem manifesti sumus; confido autem nos et in conscientiis
   vestris, manifestos esse.

   12. For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion
   to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which
   glory in appearance, and not in heart.

   12. Non enim nosmetipsos iterum commendamus vobis, sed occasionem vobis
   damus gloriandi de nobis, ut aliquid habeatis adversus eos, [530] qui
   in facie gloriantur, et non in corde.


   9. Wherefore we strive. Having shown how magnanimous Christians ought
   to be in the endurance of afflictions, [531] so that even in dying they
   may be conquerors over death, and that too, because by afflictions and
   death they attain to a blessed life, he now from the same source draws
   also another conclusion -- that they must, by all means, make it their
   main desire to please God. And indeed it cannot but be, that the hope
   of a resurrection, and thoughtfulness as to the judgment, will awaken
   in us this desire; as, on the other hand, the true reason why we are so
   indolent and remiss in duty is, that we seldom, if ever, think of what
   ought to be constantly kept in remembrance, [532] that we are here but
   lodgers [533] for a short time, that we may, after finishing our
   course, return to Christ. Observe, however, what he says -- that this
   is the desire both of the living and of the dead, by which statement
   the immortality of the soul is again confirmed.

   10. We must be manifested. Though this is common to all, yet all
   without distinction do not raise their views in such a way as to
   consider every moment, that they must appear before the judgment-seat
   of Christ. But while Paul, from a holy desire of acting aright,
   constantly sisted himself before the bar of Christ, he had it in view
   to reprove indirectly those ambitious teachers, who reckoned it enough
   to have the plaudits of their fellow-men. [534] For when he says, that
   no one can escape, he seems in a manner to summon them to that heavenly
   tribunal. Farther, though the word translated to be manifested might be
   rendered to appear, yet Paul had, in my opinion, something farther in
   view -- that we shall then come forth to the light, while for the
   present many are concealed, as it were, in the darkness. For then the
   books, which are now shut, will be opened. (Daniel 7:10.)

   That every one may give account. As the passage relates to the
   recompensing of deeds, we must notice briefly, that, as evil deeds are
   punished by God, so also good deeds are rewarded, but for a different
   reason; for evil deeds are requited with the punishment that they
   deserve, but God in rewarding good deeds does not look to merit or
   worthiness. For no work is so full and complete in all its parts as to
   be deservedly well-pleasing to him, and farther, there is no one whose
   works are in themselves well-pleasing to God, unless he render
   satisfaction to the whole law. Now no one is found to be thus perfect.
   Hence the only resource is in his accepting us through unmerited
   goodness, and justifying us, by not imputing to us our sins. After he
   has received us into favor, he receives our works also by a gracious
   acceptance. It is on this that the reward hinges. There is, therefore,
   no inconsistency in saying, that he rewards good works, provided we
   understand that mankind, nevertheless, obtain eternal life
   gratuitously. On this point I have expressed myself more fully in the
   preceding Epistle, and my Institutes will furnish a full discussion of
   it. [535] When he says in the body, I understand him to mean, not
   merely outward actions, but all the deeds that are done in this
   corporeal life.

   11. Knowing therefore. He now returns to speak of himself, or he again
   applies the general doctrine to himself personally. "I am not
   ignorant," says he, "nor devoid of the fear of God, which ought to
   reign in the hearts of all the pious." To know the terror of the Lord,
   then, is to be influenced by this consideration -- that an account must
   one day be rendered before the judgment-seat of Christ; for the man who
   seriously considers this must of necessity be touched with fear, and
   shake off all negligence. [536] He declares, therefore, that he
   discharges his apostleship faithfully and with a pure conscience, (2
   Timothy 1:3,) as one that walks in the fear of the Lord, (Acts 9:31,)
   thinking of the account to be rendered by him. As, however, his enemies
   might object: "You extol yourself, it is true, in magnificent terms,
   but who is there that sees what you affirm?" He says, in reply to this,
   that he discharges indeed the work of a teacher in the sight of men,
   but that it is known to God with what sincerity of mind he acts. "As my
   mouth speaks to men, so does my heart to God."

   And I trust This is a kind of correction of what he had said, for he
   now boasts that he has not merely God as the witness of his integrity,
   but also the Corinthians themselves, to whom he had given proof of
   himself. Two things, therefore, are to be observed here: in the first
   place, that it is not enough that an individual conducts himself
   honorably and assiduously [537] among men, if his heart is not right in
   the sight of God, (Acts 8:21;) and secondly, that boasting is vain,
   where evidence of the reality itself is wanting. For none are more bold
   in arrogating everything to themselves, than those that have nothing.
   Let, therefore, the man who would have credit given him, bring forward
   such works as may afford confirmation to his statements. To be made
   manifest in their consciences is more than to be known by proofs; for
   conscience reaches farther than carnal judgment.

   12. For we commend not ourselves. He confirms what he had said
   immediately before, and at the same time anticipates a calumny that
   might be brought against him. For it might seem as if he were too
   careful as to his own praise, inasmuch as he spoke so frequently
   respecting himself. Nay, it is probable that this reproach had been
   cast upon him by the wicked. For when he says -- We commend not
   ourselves again, he says this as if speaking in his own person. To
   commend is taken in a bad sense, as meaning to boast, or to brag.

   When he adds -- that he gives them occasion of glorying, he intimates
   in the first place, that he pleads their cause rather than his own,
   inasmuch as he gives up all with a view to their glory, and he again
   indirectly reproves their ingratitude, because they had not perceived
   it to be their duty to magnify, of their own accord, his Apostleship,
   so as not to impose upon him this necessity; and farther, because they
   had not perceived, that it was their interest rather than that of Paul
   himself, that his Apostleship should be accounted honorable. We are
   here taught, that Christ's servants ought to be concerned as to their
   own reputation, only in so far as is for the advantage of the Church.
   Paul affirms with truth, that he is actuated by this disposition. [538]
   Let others see that they do not on false grounds pretend to follow his
   example. [539] We are taught farther, that that alone is a minister's
   true praise, that is common to him with the whole Church, rather than
   peculiar to himself exclusively -- in other words, that redounds to the
   advantage of all.

   That ye may have something in opposition to those He intimates, in
   passing, that it is necessary to repress the vanity of those that make
   empty boasts, and that it is the duty of the Church to do so. For as
   ambition of this nature is a peculiarly destructive pestilence, it is
   dangerous to encourage it by dissimulation. As the Corinthians had not
   taken care to do this, Paul instructs them how they should act for the
   future.

   To glory in appearance, not in heart, is to disguise one's self by
   outward show, and to regard sincerity of heart as of no value; for
   those that will be truly wise will never glory but in God. (1
   Corinthians 1:31.) But wherever there is empty show, there is no
   sincerity, and no integrity of heart.

   2 Corinthians 5:13-17

   13. For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be
   sober, it is for your cause.

   13. Nam sive insanimus, Deo insanimus: sive sani sumus, vobis sani
   sumus.

   14. For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that
   if one died for all, then were all dead:

   14. Caritas enim Christi constringit nos: iudicantes illud, quodsi unus
   pro omnibus mortuus fuit, ergo omnes sunt mortui. [540]

   15. And that he died for all, that they which live should not
   henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and
   rose again.

   15. Et quidem pro omnibus mortuus est: ut qui vivunt, posthac non sibi
   vivant, sed ei qui pro omnibus mortuus est, et resurrexit.

   16. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we
   have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no
   more.

   16. Itaque nos posthac neminem novimus secundum carnem: quin etiam si
   secundum carnem novimus Christum, iam non amplius novimus.

   17. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
   are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

   17. Proinde si quis in Christo, nova sit creatura, [541] vetera
   praeterierunt: ecce, nova facta sunt omnia.


   13. Whether we are beside ourselves. This is said by way of concession;
   for Paul's glorying was sane, or it was, if we may so term it, a sober
   and most judicious madness; [542] but as he appeared foolish in the
   eyes of many, he speaks according to their views. Now he declares two
   things: in the first place, that he makes no account of himself, but
   has this one object in view -- that he may serve God and the Church;
   and, secondly, that he fears not the opinion of men, so that he is
   prepared for being reckoned either sane or insane, provided only he
   transacts faithfully the affairs of God and the Church. The meaning,
   therefore, is this: "As to my making mention so frequently of my
   integrity, persons will take this as they choose. It is not, however,
   for my own sake that I do it, but, on the contrary, I have God and the
   Church exclusively in view. Hence I am prepared to be silent and to
   speak, according as the glory of God and the advantage of the Church
   will require, and I shall be quite contented that the world reckon me
   beside myself, provided only it is not to myself, but to God, that I am
   beside myself." [543] This is a passage that is deserving not merely of
   notice, but also of constant meditation; for unless we shall have our
   minds thus regulated, the smallest occasions of offense will from time
   to time draw us off from our duty.

   14. For the love of Christ. The term love may be taken either in a
   passive signification, or in an active. I prefer the latter. For if we
   be not harder than iron, we cannot refrain from devoting ourselves
   entirely to Christ, when we consider what great love he exercised
   towards us, when he endured death in our stead. Paul, too, explains
   himself when he adds, that it is reasonable that we should live to him,
   being dead to ourselves. Hence, as he had previously stated: (2
   Corinthians 5:11,) that he was stirred up to duty by fear, inasmuch as
   an account was one day to be rendered by him, so he now brings forward
   another motive -- that measureless love of Christ towards us, of which
   he had furnished us with an evidence in his death. "The knowledge," I
   say, "of this love, ought to constrain our affections, that they may go
   in no other direction than that of loving him in return.

   There is a metaphor [544] implied in the word constrain, denoting that
   it is impossible but that every one that truly considers and ponders
   that wonderful love, which Christ has manifested towards us by his
   death, becomes, as it were, bound to him, and constrained by the
   closest tie, and devotes himself wholly to his service.

   If one died for all. This design is to be carefully kept in view --
   that Christ died for us, that we might die to ourselves. The exposition
   is also to be carefully noticed -- that to die to ourselves is to live
   to Christ; or if you would have it at greater length, it is to renounce
   ourselves, that we may live to Christ; for Christ. redeemed us with
   this view -- that he might have us under his authority, as his peculiar
   possession. Hence it follows that we are no longer our own masters.
   There is a similar passage in Romans 14:7-9. At the same time, there
   are two things that are here brought forward separately -- that we are
   dead in Christ, in order that all ambition and eagerness for
   distinction may be laid aside, and that it may be felt by us no
   hardship to be made as nothing; and farther, that we owe to Christ our
   life and death, because he has wholly bound us to himself. [545]

   16. Therefore we henceforth know no man. To know, here, is taken as
   meaning to reckon. "We do not judge according to external appearance,
   so as to reckon that man to be the most illustrious who seems so in
   appearance." Under the term flesh, he includes all external endowments
   which mankind are accustomed to hold in estimation; and, in short,
   every thing which, apart from regeneration, is reckoned worthy of
   praise. At the same time, he speaks more particularly of outward
   disguise, or appearance, as it is termed. He alludes, also, without
   doubt, to the death of which he had made mention. "Since we ought, all
   of us, to be dead to the present life, nay more, to be nothing in
   ourselves, no one must be reckoned a servant of Christ on the ground of
   carnal excellence."

   Nay, though we have known Christ. The meaning is -- "Though Christ
   lived for a time in this world, and was known by mankind in those
   things that have to do with the condition of the present life, he must
   now be known in another way -- spiritually, so that we may have no
   worldly thoughts respecting him." This passage is perverted by some
   fanatics, such as Servetus, [546] for the purpose of proving, that
   Christ's human nature is now absorbed by the Divinity. But how very far
   removed such a frenzy is from the Apostle's intention, it is not
   difficult to perceive; for he speaks here, not of the substance of his
   body, but of external appearance, nor does he affirm that the flesh is
   no longer perceived by us in Christ, but says, that Christ is not
   judged of from that. [547]

   Scripture proclaims throughout, that Christ does now as certainly lead
   a glorious life in our flesh, as he once suffered in it. [548] Nay
   more, take away this foundation, and our whole faith falls to the
   ground; for whence comes the hope of immortality, except from this,
   that we have already a pattern [549] of it in the person of Christ? For
   as righteousness is restored to us on this ground, that Christ, by
   fulfilling the law in our nature, has abolished Adam's disobedience, so
   also life has been restored to us by this means, that he has opened up
   for our nature the kingdom of God, from which it had been banished, and
   has given it a place in the heavenly dwelling. Hence, if we do not now
   recognize Christ's flesh, [550] we lose the whole of that confidence
   and consolation that we ought to have in him. But we acknowledge Christ
   as man, and as our brother in his flesh -- not in a fleshly manner;
   because we rest solely in the consideration of his spiritual gifts.
   Hence he is spiritual to us, not as if he laid aside the body, and
   became a spirit, but because he regenerates and governs his own people
   by the influence of his Spirit.

   17. Therefore if any man is in Christ. As there is something wanting in
   this expression, it must be supplied in this way -- "If any one is
   desirous to hold some place in Christ, that is, in the kingdom of
   Christ, or in the Church [551] let him be a new creature " By this
   expression he condemns every kind of excellence that is wont to be in
   much esteem among men, if renovation of heart is wanting. "Learning, it
   is true, and eloquence, and other endowments, are valuable, and worthy
   to be honored; but, where the fear of the Lord and an upright
   conscience are wanting, all the honor of them goes for nothing. Let no
   one, therefore, glory in any distinction, inasmuch as the chief praise
   of Christians is self-renunciation."

   Nor is this said merely for the purpose of repressing the vanity of the
   false apostles, but also with the view of correcting the ambitious
   judgments of the Corinthians, in which outward disguises were of more
   value than real sincerity -- though this is a fault that is common to
   almost all ages. For where shall we find the man that does not attach
   much more importance to show, than to true holiness? Let us, therefore,
   keep in view this admonition -- that all that are not renewed by the
   Spirit of God, should be looked upon as nothing in the Church, by
   whatever ornaments they may in other respects be distinguished.

   Old things are passed away. When the Prophets speak of the kingdom of
   Christ, they foretell that there will be new heavens and a new earth,
   (Isaiah 65:17,) meaning thereby, that all things will be changed for
   the better, until the happiness of the pious is completed. As, however,
   Christ's kingdom is spiritual, this change must take place chiefly in
   the Spirit, and hence it is with propriety that he begins with this.
   There is, therefore, an elegant and appropriate allusion, when Paul
   makes use of a commendation of this kind, for the purpose of setting
   forth the value of regeneration. Now by old things he means, the things
   that are not formed anew by the Spirit of God. Hence this term is
   placed in contrast with renewing grace. The expression passed away, he
   uses in the sense of fading away, as things that are of short duration
   are wont to fall off, when they have passed their proper season. Hence
   it is only the new man, that flourishes and is vigorous [552] in the
   kingdom of Christ.

   Though some men would count him out of his wits for it, yet he regards
   not their judgment; for if he were in an ecstasy, or beside himself,
   his purpose was to serve God and his Church, and therefore he did not
   regard the opinion of men, whether he were accounted mad or sober, so
   he might perform the end of his Apostleship. The sense, therefore, of
   it, as Calvin renders it, is this -- 'Let men take it as they will,
   that I speak so much of my integrity, I do it not upon my own account,

   -- That the Deity, before the creation of the world, had produced
   within himself two personal representations, or manners of existence,
   which were to be the medium of intercourse between him and mortals, and
   by whom, consequently, he was to reveal his will, and to display his
   mercy and beneficence to the children of men; [...] and that these two
   representations were to cease after the destruction of this terrestrial

   sister, and mother;' and he was taught by them, that though
   Christianity does not burst asunder the ties of kindred, it requires of
   all its followers that they be guided by higher considerations in
   advancing its interests. This may throw light on the bold expression
   which we find him elsewhere using, when he is speaking of the
   obligations which believers are under, not to live to themselves, but
   unto him which died for them, and rose again.' Henceforth know we no

   2 Corinthians 5:18-21

   18. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
   Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;

   18. Pro omnia ex Deo, qui nos reconciliavit sibi Iesum Christum: et
   dedit nobis ministerium reconciliationis.

   19. To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
   not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the
   word of reconciliation.

   19. Quoniam erat Deus in Christo mundum reconcilians sibi, non
   imputando illis sua ipsorum peccata: et deposuit in nobis sermonem
   reconciliationis.

   20. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
   you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

   20. Itaque pro Christo legatione fungimur, tanquam Deo exhortante per
   nos: rogamus pro Christo, reconciliemini Deo.

   21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
   might be made the righteousness of God in him.

   21. Eum qui peccatum non noverat, pro nobis peccatum fecit, ut nos
   efficeremur iustitia Dei in ipso.


   18. All things are of God. He means, all things that belong to Christ's
   kingdom. "If we would be Christ's, we must be regenerated by God. Now
   that is no ordinary gift." He does not, therefore, speak here of
   creation generally; but of the grace of regeneration, which God confers
   peculiarly upon his elect, and he affirms that it is of God -- not on
   the ground of his being the Creator and Artificer of heaven and earth,
   but inasmuch as he is the new Creator of the Church, by fashioning his
   people anew, according to his own image. Thus all flesh is abased, and
   believers are admonished that they must now live to God, inasmuch as
   they are a new creature. (2 Corinthians 5:17.) This they cannot do,
   unless they forget the world, as they are also no longer of the world,
   (John 17:16,) because they are of God

   Who hath reconciled us Here there are two leading points -- the one
   relating to the reconciliation of men with God; and the other, to the
   way in which we may enjoy the benefit of this reconciliation. Now these
   things correspond admirably with what goes before, for as the Apostle
   had given the preference to a good conscience above every kind of
   distinction, (2 Corinthians 5:11,) he now shows that the whole of the
   gospel tends to this. He shows, however, at the same time, the dignity
   of the Apostolical office, that the Corinthians may be instructed as to
   what they ought to seek in him, whereas they could not distinguish
   between true and false ministers, for this reason, that nothing but
   show delighted them. Accordingly, by making mention of this, he stirs
   them up to make greater proficiency in the doctrine of the gospel. For
   an absurd admiration of profane persons, who serve their own ambition
   rather than Christ, originates in our not knowing, what the office of
   the preaching of the gospel includes, or imports.

   I now return to those two leading points that are here touched upon.
   The first is -- that God hath reconciled us to himself by Christ This
   is immediately followed by the declaration -- Because God was in
   Christ, and has in his person accomplished reconciliation. The manner
   is subjoined -- By not imputing unto men their trespasses Again, there
   is annexed a second declaration -- Because Christ having been made a
   sin-offering for our sins, has procured righteousness for us. The
   second part of the statement is -- that the grace of reconciliation is
   applied to us by the gospel, that we may become partakers of it. Here
   we have a remarkable passage, if there be any such in any part of
   Paul's writings. Hence it is proper, that we should carefully examine
   the words one by one.

   The ministry of reconciliation Here we have an illustrious designation
   of the gospel, as being an embassy for reconciling men to God. It is
   also a singular dignity of ministers -- that they are sent to us by God
   with this commission, so as to be messengers, and in a manner sureties.
   [553] This, however, is not said so much for the purpose of commending
   ministers, as with a view to the consolation of the pious, that as
   often as they hear the gospel, they may know that God treats with them,
   and, as it were, stipulates with them as to a return to his grace. Than
   this blessing what could be more desirable? Let us therefore bear in
   mind, that this is the main design of the gospel -- that whereas we are
   by nature children of wrath, (Ephesians 2:3,) we may, by the breaking
   up of the quarrel between God and us, be received by him into favor.
   Ministers are furnished with this commission, that they may bring us
   intelligence of so great a benefit, nay more, may assure us of God's
   fatherly love towards us. Any other person, it is true, might also be a
   witness to us of the grace of God, but Paul teaches, that this office
   is specially intrusted to ministers. When, therefore, a duly ordained
   minister proclaims in the gospel, that God has been made propitious to
   us, he is to be listened to just as an ambassador of God, and
   sustaining, as they speak, a public character, and furnished with
   rightful authority for assuring us of this.

   19. God was in Christ. Some take this as meaning simply -- God
   reconciled the world to himself in Christ; but the meaning is fuller
   and more comprehensive -- first, that God was in Christ; and, secondly,
   that he reconciled the world to himself by his intercession. It is also
   of the Father that this is affirmed; for it were an improper
   expression, were you to understand it as meaning, that the divine
   nature of Christ was in him. [554] The Father, therefore, was in the
   Son, in accordance with that statement --

   I am in the Father, and the Father in me. (John 10:38.)

   Therefore he that hath the Son, hath the Father also. For Paul has made
   use of this expression with this view -- that we may learn to be
   satisfied with Christ alone, because in him we find also God the
   Father, as he truly communicates himself to us by him. Hence the
   expression is equivalent to this -- "Whereas God had withdrawn to a
   distance from us, he has drawn near to us in Christ, and thus Christ
   has become to us the true Emmanuel, and his coming is God's drawing
   near to men."

   The second part of the statement points out the office of Christ -- his
   being our propitiation, (1 John 2:2,) because out of Him, God is
   displeased with us all, inasmuch as we have revolted from
   righteousness. [555] For what purpose, then, has God appeared to men in
   Christ? For the purpose of reconciliation -- that, hostilities being
   removed, those who were aliens, might be adopted as sons. Now, although
   Christ's coming as our Redeemer originated in the fountain of Divine
   love towards us, yet until men perceive that God has been propitiated
   by the Mediator, there must of necessity be a variance remaining, with
   respect to them, which shuts them out from access to God. On this point
   we shall speak more fully ere long.

   Not imputing to them. Mark, in what way men return into favor with God
   -- when they are regarded as righteous, by obtaining the remission of
   their sins. For so long as God imputes to us our sins, He must of
   necessity regard us with abhorrence; for he cannot be friendly or
   propitious to sinners. But this statement may seem to be at variance
   with what is said elsewhere -- that, we were loved by Him before the
   creation of the world, (Ephesians 1:4,) and still more with what he
   says, (John 3:16,) that the love, which he exercised towards us was the
   reason, why He expiated our sins by Christ, for the cause always goes
   before its effect. I answer, that we were loved before the creation of
   the world, but it was only in Christ In the mean time, however, I
   confess, that the love of God was first in point of time, and of order,
   too, as to God, but with respect to us, the commencement of his love
   has its foundation in the sacrifice of Christ. For when we contemplate
   God without a Mediator, we cannot conceive of Him otherwise than as
   angry with us: a Mediator interposed between us, makes us feel, that He
   is pacified towards us. As, however, this also is necessary to be known
   by us -- that Christ came forth to us from the fountain of God's free
   mercy, the Scripture explicitly teaches both -- that the anger of the
   Father has been appeased by the sacrifice of the Son, and that the Son
   has been offered up for the expiation of the sins of men on this ground
   -- because God, exercising compassion towards them, receives them, on
   the ground of such a pledge, into favor. [556]

   The whole may be summed up thus: "Where sin is, there the anger of God
   is, and therefore God is not propitious to us without, or before, his
   blotting out our sins, by not imputing them. As our consciences cannot
   apprehend this benefit, [557] otherwise than through the intervention
   of Christ's sacrifice, it is not without good reason, that Paul makes
   that the commencement and cause of reconciliation, with regard to us.

   And hath committed to us. Again he repeats, that a commission has been
   given to the ministers of the gospel to communicate to us this grace.
   For it might be objected, "Where is Christ now, the peacemaker between
   God and us? At what a distance he resides from us!" He says, therefore,
   that as he has once suffered, [558] (1 Peter 3:18,) so he daily
   presents to us the fruit of his suffering through means of the Gospel,
   which he designed, should be in the world, [559] as a sure and
   authentic register of the reconciliation, that has once been effected.
   It is the part of ministers, therefore, to apply to us, so to speak,
   the fruit of Christ's death.

   Lest, however, any one should dream of a magical application, such as
   Papists contrive, [560] we must carefully observe what he immediately
   subjoins -- that it consists wholly in the preaching of the Gospel. For
   the Pope, along with his priests, makes use of this pretext for giving
   a color of warrant for the whole of that wicked and execrable system of
   merchandise, which they carry on, in connection with the salvation of
   souls. "The Lord," say they, "has furnished us with a commission and
   authority to forgive sins." This I acknowledge, provided they discharge
   that embassy, of which Paul here makes mention. The absolution,
   however, which they make use of in the Papacy, is entirely magical; and
   besides, they inclose pardon of sins in lead and parchment, or they
   connect it with fictitious and frivolous superstitions. What
   resemblance do all these things bear to the appointment of Christ?
   Hence the ministers of the Gospel restore us to the favor of God in a
   right and orderly manner, when they bear testimony to us by means of
   the Gospel as to the favor of God having been procured for us. Let this
   testimony be removed, and nothing remains but mere imposture. Beware,
   then, of placing even the smallest drop of your confidence on any thing
   apart from the Gospel.

   I do not, indeed, deny, that the grace of Christ is applied to us in
   the sacraments, and that our reconciliation with God is then confirmed
   in our consciences; but, as the testimony of the Gospel is engraven
   upon the sacraments, they are not to be judged of separately by
   themselves, but must be taken in connection with the Gospel, of which
   they are appendages. In fine, the ministers of the Church are
   ambassadors, for testifying and proclaiming the benefit of
   reconciliation, only on this condition -- that they speak from the
   Gospel, as from an authentic register.

   20. As if God did beseech you This is of no small importance for giving
   authority to the embassy: nay more, it is absolutely necessary, for who
   would rest upon the testimony of men, in reference to his eternal
   salvation? It is a matter of too much importance, to allow of our
   resting contented with the promise of men, without feeling assured that
   they are ordained by God, and that God speaks to us by them. This is
   the design of those commendations, with which Christ himself signalizes
   his Apostles:

   He that heareth you, heareth me, etc. (Luke 10:16.)

   Whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,
   (Matthew 18:18,)

   and the like.

   We entreat you, in Christ's stead. Hence we infer, with what propriety
   Isaiah exclaims,

   How blessed are the feet of them that preach the Gospel!
   (Isaiah 52:7.)

   For that one thing, that is of itself sufficient for completing our
   felicity, and without which we are most miserable, is conferred upon
   us, only through means of the Gospel. If, however, this duty is
   enjoined upon all the ministers of the Church, in such a way, that he
   who does not discharge this embassy is not to be regarded either as an
   Apostle, or as a Pastor, we may very readily judge from this, as to the
   nature of the Pope's entire hierarchy. They are desirous, indeed, to be
   looked upon as Apostles and Pastors; but as they are dumb idols, how
   will their boasting [561] correspond with this passage of Paul's
   writings. The word entreat is expressive of an unparalleled [562]
   commendation of the grace of Christ, inasmuch as He stoops so low, that
   he does not disdain to entreat us. So much the less excusable is our
   depravity, if we do not, on meeting with such kindness, show ourselves
   teachable and compliant.

   Be reconciled. It is to be observed, that Paul is here addressing
   himself to believers. He declares, that he brings to them every day
   this embassy. Christ therefore, did not suffer, merely that he might
   once expiate our sins, nor was the gospel appointed merely with a view
   to the pardon of those sins which we committed previously to baptism,
   but that, as we daily sin, so we might, also, by a daily remission, be
   received by God into his favor. For this is a continued embassy, [563]
   which must be assiduously sounded forth in the Church, till the end of
   the world; and the gospel cannot be preached, unless remission of sins
   is promised.

   We have here an express and suitable declaration for refuting the
   impious tenet of Papists, which calls upon us to seek the remission of
   sins after Baptism from some other source, than from the expiation that
   was effected through the death of Christ. Now this doctrine is commonly
   held in all the schools of Popery -- that, after baptism, we merit the
   remission of sins by penitence, through means of the aid of the keys,
   [564] (Matthew 16:19,) -- as if baptism itself could confer this [565]
   upon us without penitence. By the term penitence, however, they mean
   satisfactions. But what does Paul say here? He calls us to go, not less
   after baptism, than before it, to the one expiation made by Christ,
   that we may know that we always obtain it gratuitously. Farther, all
   their prating as to the administration of the keys is to no purpose,
   inasmuch as they conceive of keys apart from the Gospel, while they are
   nothing else than that testimony of a gratuitous reconciliation, which
   is made to us in the Gospel.

   21. Him who knew no sin. Do you observe, that, according to Paul, there
   is no return to favor with God, except what is founded on the sacrifice
   of Christ alone? Let us learn, therefore, to turn our views in that
   direction, whenever we desire to be absolved from guilt. He now teaches
   more clearly, what we adverted to above -- that God is propitious to
   us, when he acknowledges us as righteous. For these two things are
   equivalent -- that we are acceptable to God, and that we are regarded
   by him as righteous.

   To know no sin is to be free from sin. He says, then, that Christ,
   while he was entirely exempt from sin, was made sin for us. It is
   commonly remarked, that sin here denotes an expiatory sacrifice for
   sin, and in the same way the Latin's term it, piaculum [566] Paul, too,
   has in this, and other passages, borrowed this phrase from the Hebrews,
   among whom 'sm (asham) denotes an expiatory sacrifice, as well as an
   offense or crime. [567] But the signification of this word, as well as
   the entire statement, will be better understood from a comparison of
   both parts of the antithesis. Sin is here contrasted with
   righteousness, when Paul teaches us, that we were made the
   righteousness of God, on the ground of Christ's having been made sin.
   Righteousness, here, is not taken to denote a quality or habit, but by
   way of imputation, on the ground of Christ's righteousness being
   reckoned to have been received by us. What, on the other hand, is
   denoted by sin? It is the guilt, on account of which we are arraigned
   at the bar of God. As, however, the curse of the individual was of old
   cast upon the victim, so Christ's condemnation was our absolution, and
   with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5.)

   The righteousness of God in him In the first place, the righteousness
   of God is taken here to denote -- not that which is given us by God,
   but that which is approved of by him, as in John 12:43, the glory of
   God means -- that which is in estimation with him -- the glory of men
   denotes the vain applause of the world. Farther, in Romans 3:23, when
   he says, that we have come short of the glory of God, he means, that
   there is nothing that we can glory in before God, for it is no very
   difficult matter to appear righteous before men, but it is a mere
   delusive appearance of righteousness, which becomes at last the ground
   of perdition. Hence, that is the only true righteousness, which is
   acceptable to God.

   Let us now return to the contrast between righteousness and sin How are
   we righteous in the sight of God? It is assuredly in the same respect
   in which Christ was a sinner. For he assumed in a manner our place,
   that he might be a criminal in our room, and might be dealt with as a
   sinner, not for his own offenses, but for those of others, inasmuch as
   he was pure and exempt from every fault, and might endure the
   punishment that was due to us -- not to himself. It is in the same
   manner, assuredly, that we are now righteous in him -- not in respect
   of our rendering satisfaction to the justice of God by our own works,
   but because we are judged of in connection with Christ's righteousness,
   which we have put on by faith, that it might become ours. On this
   account I have preferred to retain the particle en, (in,) rather than
   substitute in its place per, (through,) for that signification
   corresponds better with Paul's intention. [568]

   2 Corinthians 6:1-10

   1. We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye
   receive not the grace of God in vain.

   1. Nos vero adiuvantes (vel, collaborantes) [569] etiam obsecramus, ne
   frustra gratiam Dei receperitis.

   2. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day
   of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time;
   behold, now is the day of salvation.)

   2. Dicit enim (Ies. 49, 8) Tempore accepto exaudivi te, et in die
   salutis auxiliatus sum tibi: ecce, nunc tempus acceptum: ecce, nunc
   dies salutis.

   3. Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

   3. Nullum dantes [570] ulla in re offensionem, ut ne vituperetur
   ministerium:

   4. But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in
   much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

   4. Sed in omnibus commendantes nos [571] tanquam Dei moerore, in
   patientia multa, in afflictionibus, in necessitatibus, in angustiis,

   5. In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings,
   in fastings;

   5. In plagis, in carceribus, in seditionibus, in laboribus, in
   vigiliis, in ieiuniis;

   6. By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the
   Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

   6. In sinceritate, in scientia, in tolerantia, in mansuetudine, in
   Spiritu Sancto, in caritate non ficta,

   7. By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
   righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

   7. In sermone veritatis, in potentia Dei, per arma iustitiæ dextra et
   sinistra:

   8. By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
   deceivers, and yet true;

   8. Per gloriam et ignominiam, per infamiam, et bonam famam: tanquam
   impostores, tamen veraces:

   9. As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as
   chastened, and not killed;

   9. Tanquam ignoti, tamen celebres: tanquam morientes, et ecce, vivimus;
   tanquam castigati, tamen morte non affecti:

   10. As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich;
   as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

   10. Tanquam moerore affecti, semper tamen gaudentes: tanquam inopes,
   multos tamen ditantes: tanquam nihil habentes, et omnia possidentes.


   1. Assisting. He has repeated the instructions of embassy with which
   the ministers of the gospel have been furnished by God. After they have
   faithfully communicated these instructions, they must also use their
   endeavor, that they may be carried into effect, [572] in order that
   their labor may not be in vain. They must, I say, add continual
   exhortation's, [573] that their embassy may be efficacious. This is
   what he means by sunergountes, (fellow-workers,) that is, devoted to
   the advancement of the work; for it is not enough to teach, if you do
   not also urge. In this way, the particle sun would have a relation to
   God, or to the embassy, which he assigns to his servants. For the
   doctrine of the gospel is helped by exhortations, so as not to be
   without effect, and ministers connect their endeavors with God's
   commission; [574] as it is the part of an ambassador to enforce by
   arguments, what he brings forward in the name of his prince.

   The particle sun may also be taken as referring to the endeavors of
   ministers in common; for if they do the Lord's work in good earnest,
   they must mutually lend a helping hand to each other, so as to give
   assistance to each other. I rather prefer, however, the former
   exposition. Chrysostom interprets it as referring to the hearers, with
   whom ministers are fellow-workers, when they rouse them up from
   slothfulness and indolence.

   Ministers are here taught, that it is not enough simply to advance
   doctrine. They must also labor that it may be received by the hearers,
   and that not once merely, but continually. For as they are messengers
   between God and men, the first duty devolving upon them is, to make
   offer of the grace of God, [575] and the second is, to strive with all
   their might, that it may not be offered in vain.

   2. For he saith, In an acceptable time. He quotes a prediction of
   Isaiah, exceedingly appropriate to the exhortation of which he speaks.
   It is without doubt of the kingdom of Christ that he there speaks,
   [576] as is manifest from the context. The Father, then, appointing his
   Son a leader, for the purpose of gathering together a Church, addresses
   him in these words:

   "I have heard thee in an acceptable time." (Isaiah 49:8.)

   We know, however, what a degree of correspondence [577] there is
   between the Head and the members. For Christ was heard in our name, as
   the salvation of all of us is entrusted into his hand, and nothing else
   has he taken under his charge. Hence we are all admonished in the
   person of Christ -- not to slight the opportunity that is afforded for
   obtaining salvation. While the rendering of the Greek interpreter is,
   euprosdekton, (acceptable,) [578] the word made use of by the Prophet
   is, rtsvn, (ratson,) that is, benevolence, or free favour. [579]

   The quotation must be applied to the subject in hand in this way: "As
   God specifies a particular time for the exhibition of his grace, it
   follows that all times are not suitable for that. As a particular day
   of salvation is named, it follows that a free offer of salvation is not
   made every day." Now this altogether depends on the providence of God,
   for the acceptable time is no other than what is called in Galatians
   4:4, the fullness of the time [580] The order of arrangement also must
   be observed. First, he makes mention of a time of benevolence, and then
   afterwards of a day of salvation By this it is intimated, that
   salvation flows to us from the mercy of God exclusively, as from a
   fountainhead. Hence we must not seek the cause in ourselves, as if we
   by means of our own works moved God to assign to us his favor, for
   whence comes the day of salvation? It is because it is the acceptable
   time, that is, the time which God has in his free favor appointed. In
   the mean time, we must keep in view what Paul designs to teach -- that
   there is need of prompt expedition, that we may not allow the
   opportunity to pass unimproved, inasmuch as it displeases God, that the
   grace that he offers to us should be received by us with coolness and
   indifference.

   Behold now is the time The Prophet had spoken of the time, when Christ
   was to be manifested in the flesh for the redemption of men. Paul
   transfers the prophecy to the time when Christ is revealed by the
   continued preaching of the gospel, and it is with good reason that he
   does so, for as salvation was once sent to the whole world, when Christ
   appeared, so now it is sent to us every day, when we are made partakers
   of the gospel. Here we have a beautiful passage, and affording no
   ordinary consolation, because, while the gospel is preached to us, we
   know assuredly that the way is opened up for us into the kingdom of
   God, and that there is a signal of divine benevolence raised aloft, to
   invite us to receive salvation, for the opportunity of obtaining it
   must be judged of by the call. Unless, however, we embrace the
   opportunity, we must fear the threatening that Paul brings forward --
   that, in a short time, the door will be shut against all that have not
   entered in, while opportunity was afforded. For this retribution always
   follows contempt of the word.

   3. Giving no offense We have already on several occasions remarked,
   that Paul sometimes commends the ministry of the gospel generally, and
   at other times his own integrity. [581] In the present instance, then,
   he speaks of himself, and sets before us in his own person a living
   picture of a good and faithful apostle, that the Corinthians may be led
   to see how unfair they were in their judgment, in preferring before him
   empty blusterers. [582] For as they assigned the praise to mere
   pretences, [583] they held in the highest esteem persons that were
   effeminate and devoid of zeal, while, on the other hand, as to the best
   ministers, they cherished no views but such as were mean and abject.
   Nor is there any reason to doubt, that those very things that Paul
   makes mention of to his own commendation, had been brought forward by
   them in part as a ground of contempt; and they were so much the more
   deserving of reproof, inasmuch as they converted into matter of
   reproach, what was ground of just praise.

   Paul, therefore, treats here of three things: In the first place, he
   shows what are the excellences, on the ground of which preachers of the
   gospel ought to be esteemed; secondly, he shows that he is himself
   endowed with those excellences; thirdly, he admonishes the Corinthians
   not to acknowledge as Christ's servants those who conduct themselves
   otherwise than he prescribes here by his example. His design is, that
   he may procure authority for himself and those that were like him, with
   a view to the glory of God and the good of the Church, or may restore
   it where it has fallen into decay; and secondly, that he may call back
   the Corinthians from an unreasonable attachment to the false apostles,
   which was a hinderance in the way of their making so much proficiency
   in the gospel as was necessary. Ministers give occasion of stumbling,
   when by their own misconduct they hinder the progress of the gospel on
   the part of their hearers. That Paul says he does not do; for he
   declares that he carefully takes heed not to stain his apostleship by
   any spot of disgrace.

   For this is the artifice of Satan -- to seek some misconduct on the
   part of ministers, that may tend to the dishonor of the gospel. For
   when he has been successful in bringing the ministry into contempt, all
   hope of profit is at an end. Hence the man who would usefully serve
   Christ, must strive with his whole might to maintain the credit of his
   ministry. The method is -- to take care that he be deserving of honor,
   for nothing is more ridiculous than striving to maintain your
   reputation before others, while you call forth upon yourself reproach
   by a wicked and base life. That man, therefore, will alone be
   honorable, who will allow himself in nothing that is unworthy of a
   minister of Christ.

   4. In much patience. The whole of the enumeration that follows is
   intended to show, that all the tests by which the Lord is accustomed to
   try his servants were to be found in Paul, and that there was no kind
   of test to which he had not been subjected, in order that the
   faithfulness of his ministry might be more fully established. [584]
   Among other things that he enumerates, there are some that are under
   all circumstances required for all the servants of Christ. Of this
   nature are labors, sincerity, knowledge, watchings, gentleness, love,
   the word of truth, the Spirit, the power of God, the armor of
   righteousness. There are other things that are not necessary in all
   cases; for in order that any one may be a servant of Christ, it is not
   absolutely necessary, that he be put to the test by means of stripes
   and imprisonments Hence these things will in some cases be wanting in
   the experience of the best. It becomes all, however, to be of such a
   disposition as to present themselves to be tried, as Paul was, with
   stripes and imprisonments, if the Lord shall see meet.

   Patience is the regulation of the mind in adversity, which is an
   excellence that ought invariably to distinguish a good minister. [585]
   Afflictions include more than necessities; for by the term necessity
   here I understand poverty. Now this is common to many ministers, there
   being few of them that are not in poor circumstances; but at the same
   time not to all. For why should a moderate amount of riches prevent a
   man from being reckoned a servant of Christ, who, in other respects, is
   pious, is of upright mind and honorable deportment, and is
   distinguished by other excellences. As the man that is poor is not on
   that account to be straightway accounted a good minister, so the man
   that is rich is not on that account to be rejected. Nay more, Paul in
   another passage glories not less in his knowing how to abound, than in
   knowing how to be in want. (Philippians 4:12.) Hence we must observe
   the distinction that I have mentioned, between occasional and
   invariable grounds of commendation. [586]

   5. In tumults In proportion to the calmness and gentleness of Paul's
   disposition was there the greater excellence displayed in his standing
   undaunted in the face of tumults; and he takes praise to himself on
   this account -- that while he regarded tumults with abhorrence, he
   nevertheless encountered them with bravery. [587] Nor does the praise
   simply consist in his being unmoved by tumults, (this being commonly
   found among all riotous persons, [588] ) but in his being thrown into
   no alarm by tumults that had been stirred up through the fault of
   others. And, unquestionably, two things are required on the part of
   ministers of the Gospel -- that they should endeavor to the utmost of
   their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward,
   undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside
   from the right course, though heaven and earth should be mingled. [589]
   Chrysostom, however, prefers to understand akatastasiais to mean --
   frequent expulsions, [590] inasmuch as there afforded him a place of
   rest. [591] In fastings He does not mean -- hunger arising from
   destitution, but a voluntary exercise of abstinence.

   Knowledge may be taken in two senses -- either as meaning doctrine
   itself, or skill in acting properly and knowingly. The latter appears
   to me the more likely, as he immediately adds -- the word of truth The
   Spirit is taken by metonymy, to denote spiritual graces. Frivolous,
   however, is the cavil of Chrysostom, who infers from this, that the
   other excellences are peculiar to the Apostle, because he makes mention
   of the Spirit separately, as if kindness, knowledge, pureness, armor of
   righteousness, were from any other source, than from the Holy Spirit.
   He makes mention, however, of the Spirit separately, as a general term
   in the midst of particular instances. [592] The power of God showed
   itself in many things -- in magnanimity, in efficacy in the maintaining
   of the truth, in the propagation of the Gospel, in victory over
   enemies, and the like.

   7. By the armor of righteousness By righteousness you must understand
   -- rectitude of conscience, and holiness of life. He employs the
   metaphor of armor, because all that serve God require to fight,
   inasmuch as the devil is always on the alert, to molest them. Now they
   must be completely armed, because, if he does not succeed in one onset,
   he thereupon makes a new attempt, and attacks them at one time from
   before, at another from behind -- now on this side, and then on that.
   [593]

   8. By honor and dishonor This is no slight test for subjecting a man to
   trial, for to a man of a noble spirit nothing is more unpleasant, than
   to incur disgrace. Hence we may observe in all histories, that there
   have been few men of heroism that have not fallen back, on being
   irritated by insults. [594] Hence it is indicative of a mind well
   established in virtue, not to be moved away from one's course by any
   disgrace that may be incurred -- a rare virtue, but one without which
   you cannot show that you are a servant of God. We must, it is true,
   have a regard to good character, but it must be only in so far as the
   edification of our brethren requires it, and in such a way as not to be
   dependent on reports [595] -- nay more, so as to maintain in the same
   even course in honor and in dishonor. For God allows us to be tried
   even by the slander of wicked men, with the view of trying us, [596]
   whether we act uprightly from disinterested motives; [597] for if one
   is drawn aside from duty by the ingratitude of men, that man shows that
   he had not his eye directed to God alone. As then we see that Paul was
   exposed to infamy and insults, and yet did not on that account stop
   short, but held forward with undaunted courage, and broke through every
   impediment so as to reach the goal, [598] let us not give way, if the
   same thing should befall us.

   As deceivers Here he relates, not simply in what estimation he was held
   by the wicked and those that were without, (1 Corinthians 5:12,) but
   also what views were entertained of him by those that were within. Now
   let every one consider with himself, how unseemly was the ingratitude
   of the Corinthians, and how great was his magnanimity in struggling
   forward, in spite of such formidable obstacles. By indirect
   representations, however, he sharply reproves their perverse judgment,
   when he says that he lives and is joyful, while they despised him as
   one that was dead and overwhelmed with grief. He reproaches them, also,
   with ingratitude, when he says, that he made many rich, while he was
   contemned on account of his poverty. For they were of the number of
   those whom he enriched by his wealth: nay more, all of them to a man
   were under obligations to him on many accounts. Thus he said
   previously, by way of irony, that he was unknown, while at the same
   time the fruit of his labor was everywhere known and celebrated. But
   how cruel to despise the poverty of the man who supplies you [599] from
   his abundance! He means spiritual riches, which ought to be much more
   esteemed than earthly.

   [575] "The grace of God," says Dr. Brown, when commenting on Peter
   5:12, "properly signifies -- the kindness, the free favor of God, as a
   principle in the Divine mind; but is often employed to signify the
   deeds of kindness, the gifts and benefits, in which the principle finds
   expression. It has been common to interpret the phrase here as
   equivalent to the gospel, the revelation of God's grace; and the
   Apostle has been considered as affirming that the doctrine which those
   he was writing to had embraced, and to which they had adhered -- to use
   the Apostle Paul's phrase, which they had received, and in which they
   stood,' was the true gospel. But I doubt if the gospel is ever called
   the grace of God in the New Testament; and I equally doubt whether the
   words, thus understood, are an accurate statement of what this Epistle
   actually contains. There are just two other passages in the New
   Testament in which the grace of God has been supposed to be a
   designation of the gospel. After stating the message of mercy, which
   the ministers of reconciliation are called to deliver, the Apostle, in
   his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, says -- 'We beseech you that ye
   receive not the grace, or this grace of God in vain,' (2 Corinthians
   6:1.) The reference here is, no doubt, to the gospel, but the meaning
   of the phrase, the grace of God, is plainly just this divine favor,
   this benefit which so expresses, and, as it were, embodies, the divine
   grace. And in the Epistle to Titus, the same Apostle states, that the
   grace of God bringing salvation' has been manifested, or has appeared,
   teaching' those who apprehend it, to deny ungodliness, and worldly
   lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present
   world.' (Titus 2:11, 12.) The grace of God is often said to mean here
   the gospel, but the gospel is the manifestation, the revelation of this
   grace; and the truth, taught in the passage is, that the free,
   sovereign mercy of God, when it is apprehended by the sinner, is the
   true principle of holiness in the heart and life." -- Brown's

   [578] The precise word in the Septuagint version (with which the

   circumstance, that that adjective is employed by the Apostle in the
   latter part of the verse, when commenting upon the passage quoted. --
   Ed.

   [579] The Hebrew term referred to is employed in this sense in the
   following (among other) instances: Psalm 5:13; 30:7; Proverbs 16:15;
   19:12. -- Ed.

   [580] Calvin makes a similar observation when commenting on the
   expression here referred to, in Galatians 4:4. "Pergit in similitudine
   adducta, et suo instituto definitum a Patre tempus accommodat: simul
   tamen ostendit, tempus illud, quod Dei providentia ordinatum erat,
   maturum fuisse et opportunum. Ea igitur demum iusta est opportunitas ac
   recta agendi dispensatio, qu' providentia Dei regitur;" -- "He proceeds
   with the comparison which he had brought forward, and applies to his
   purpose the expression which had been made use of -- the time appointed
   by the father, but still showing that that time, which had been

   and denote patient endurance of the various afflictions specified in

   changing his country, because they did not allow him to be in peace in
   any place in which he might be."

   [591] Semler understands the term in the same sense -- "Quod non licet
   diu manere et quiescere quasi uno in loco, sed semper periculorum
   vitandorum causa locum et solum mutare. Iud'i autem faciunt jam infensi
   et infesti hostes Pauli, ut vel ex actibus Luc' satis patet; Paulus

   ("As not being allowed to remain long at rest, as it were, in one
   place, but always changing his place and soil (for the sake of avoiding
   dangers.) The Jews were enemies to Paul, so exasperated and deadly, as
   appears even from Luke's narrative in the Acts, that Paul may be said
   to have been unstable, (James 1:8,) though without any fault on his
   part." -- "I agree," says Dr. Bloomfield, "with Theophyl., Schleus.,
   and Leun., that the term refers to that unsettled and wandering kind of
   life, which, that the Apostle thought very miserable, is plain from his
   connecting it at 1 Corinthians 4:11, with the endurance of hunger,
   thirst, and nakedness,(Peinomen kai dipsomen, kai gumneteuomen, kai
   astatoumen) which passage, indeed, is the best comment on the present,
   and shows that kopois (labors) must be chiefly understood of his labors
   at his trade, and nesteiais, (fastings,) of that insufficient support,
   which labors so interrupted by his ministerial duties, could alone be
   expected to supply. 'Agrupniais (watchings) seems to refer to the
   abridgment of his rest by night, to make up for the time expended by
   day on his ministerial labors." -- Ed.

   [592] " 'En pneumati hagio -- 'In demonstration of the Holy Spirit --
   so that I showed that the Holy Spirit wrought by me.' It is possible,
   that in these words, Paul makes an allusion to the charismata, (gifts,)

   genus and species over against each other." -- Billroth. -- Ed.

   [593] "Here the spiritual arms are not particularized; yet the terms

   2 Corinthians 6:11-18

   11. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
   enlarged.

   11. Os nostrum apertum est ad vos, O Corinthii, cor nostrum dilatatum
   est.

   12. Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
   bowels.

   12. Non estis angusti in nobis, sed angusti estis in visceribus
   vestris. [600]

   13. Now, for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)
   be ye also enlarged. [601]

   13. Eandem vero remunerationem, nem, ut a filiis, exigo: dilatamini et
   vos.

   14. Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
   fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
   hath light with darkness?

   14. Ne ducatis iugum cum infidelibus: quæ enim participatio iustitæ cum
   iniquitate: quæ communicatio luci cum tenebris?

   15. And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
   believeth with an infidel?

   15. Quis consensus Christo cum Belial: aut quo portio fideli cum
   infideli?

   16. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are
   the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them,
   and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

   16. Quautem conventio templo Dei cum idolis? vos enim estis templum Dei
   viventis: quemadmodum dicit Deus (Leviticus 26:12,) Habitabo in ipsis,
   et in medio eorum ambulabo: et ero Deus illorum, et erunt mihi populus.

   17. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
   Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,

   17. Quamobrem exite de medio eorum et separamini, dicit Dominus (Ies.
   lii. 11,) et immundum ne tetigeritis:

   18. And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
   daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

   18. Et ego suscipiam vos, et ero vobis in patrem, et eritis mihi in
   filios et filias, dicit Dominus omnipotens, (Jeremiah 31:9.)


   11 Our mouth is opened. As the opening of the mouth is a sign of
   boldness, [602] if you are inclined to connect this with what goes
   before, the meaning will be this, -- "I have ample ground of glorying,
   and an upright conscience opens my mouth. Your entertaining unfavorable
   views of us, is not owing to any fault on our part, but arises from
   your being unfair judges. For you ought to have entertained more
   favorable views of my ministry, which God has rendered honorable to you
   in so many ways." I explain it, however, otherwise; for he says that
   the reason why his mouth was opened was, that his heart was enlarged
   Now what is meant by enlargement of heart? Undoubtedly it means the
   cheerfulness that springs from benevolence. [603] It is quite a common
   figure, to speak of a narrow and contracted heart as denoting either
   grief, or disgust, while, on the other hand, an enlarged heart is
   employed to denote dispositions of an opposite kind. Hence Paul here
   says nothing but what we every day experience, for when we have to do
   with friends, our heart is enlarged, all our feelings are laid open,
   there is nothing there that is hid, nothing shut, -- nay more, the
   whole mind leaps and exults to unfold itself openly to view. [604]
   Hence it is, that the tongue, also, is free and unfettered, does not
   faulter, does not with difficulty draw up from the bottom of the throat
   broken syllables, as usually happens when the mind is influenced by a
   less joyful affection.

   12. Ye are not straitened in us That is, "It is owing to your own fault
   that you are not able to share in this feeling of cheerfulness, which I
   entertain towards you. My mouth is opened, so that I deal familiarly
   with you, my very heart would willingly pour itself forth, [605] but
   you shut up your bowels." He means to say, that it is owing to their
   corrupt judgment, that the things that he utters are not relished by
   them.

   13. Now the same requital He softens his reproof by addressing them
   kindly as his sons, and also by this exhortation, by which he intimates
   that he still entertains good hopes of them. By the same requital he
   means -- mutual duty, for there is a mutual return of duty between a
   father and his sons. For as it is the duty of parents to nourish their
   children, to instruct them, to direct them by their counsel, and to
   defend them, so it is the dictate of equity, that children should
   requite their parents. (1 Timothy 6:4.) In fine, he means what the
   Greeks call antipelargian -- affection exercised in return. [606] "I
   cherish," says he, "towards you paternal affection: show yourselves
   then to be my sons by affection and respect in return." At the same
   time there is a particular circumstance that must be noticed, That the
   Corinthians, having found so indulgent a father, may also show
   gentleness in their turn, and may requite his kind condescension by
   their docility, he exhorts them with this view to be enlarged in their
   own bowels. The Old Interpreter, not having caught Paul's meaning, has
   added the participle having, and has thus expressed his own view rather
   than Paul's. In our exposition, on the other hand, (which is
   Chrysostom's, also,) there is nothing forced. [607]

   14. Be not yoked As if regaining his authority, he now reproves them
   more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers
   with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show
   themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the
   rights that belong to him, [608] reproves the fault into which they had
   fallen. Now we mentioned in the former epistle [609] what this fault
   was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was unlawful for
   them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked
   superstitions without any reserve. For in frequenting the banquets of
   unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure
   rites, and while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought
   themselves innocent. On this account Paul inveighs here against outward
   idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand aloof from it, and have no
   connection with it. He begins, however, with a general statement, with
   the view of coming down from that to a particular instance, for to be
   yoked with unbelievers means nothing less than to

   have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
   (Ephesians 5:11,)

   and to hold out the hand to them [610] in token of agreement.

   Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but the context clearly
   shows that they are mistaken. The word that Paul makes use of means --
   to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a metaphor
   taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and
   to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke. [611]
   When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with
   unbelievers in drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we
   should have no fellowship with them in their pollutions. For one sun
   shines upon us, we eat of the same bread, we breathe the same air, and
   we cannot altogether refrain from intercourse with them; but Paul
   speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of participation in works, in
   which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On this principle
   marriage will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by which
   both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but
   what I mean is simply this, that Paul's doctrine is of too general a
   nature to be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing
   here as to the shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are
   prohibited from contracting marriages with the wicked.

   For what fellowship He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its
   being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of
   things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more
   coalesce than fire and water. In short it comes to this, that unless
   they would have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain
   from the pollutions of the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even
   those that do not in their hearts approve of superstitions are,
   nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do not openly and
   ingenuously stand aloof from them.

   15. What concord has Christ with Belial? As to the etymology of the
   word Belial, even the Hebrews themselves are not agreed [612] The
   meaning, however, is not doubtful. [613] For Moses takes a word or
   thought of Belial [614] to mean a wicked and base thought, [615] and in
   various instances [616] those who are wicked and abandoned to iniquity,
   are called men, or sons of Belial. (Deuteronomy 13:13; Judges 19:22; 1
   Samuel 2:12.) Hence it is, that Paul has employed the word here to mean
   the devil, the head of all wicked persons. For from what holds good as
   to the two heads, he comes down without delay to the members: "As there
   is an irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must
   keep aloof from partnership with the wicked." When, however, Paul says
   that a Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not
   mean as to food, clothing, estates, the sun, the air, as I have
   mentioned above, but as to those things that are peculiar to
   unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated us.

   16. What agreement hath the temple of God with idols? Hitherto he has
   in general terms prohibited believers from associating with the wicked.
   He now lets them know what was the chief reason, why he had prohibited
   them from such an association -- because they had ceased to reckon the
   profession of idolatry to be a sin. He had censured that liberty, and
   had exposed it at great length in the former Epistle. It is probable,
   however, that all had not yet been gained over, so as to receive the
   counsel which he had given. Hence it was that he complained of their
   being straitened in their own bowels -- the only thing that hindered
   their proficiency. [617] He does not, however, resume that subject
   anew, but contents himself with a short admonition, as we are
   accustomed to do, when we treat of things that are well known. At the
   same time his brevity does not prevent his giving sharp cuts. For how
   much emphasis there is in that single word, where he teaches that there
   is no agreement between the temple of God and idols! "It is a
   sacrilegious profanation, [618] when an idol or any idolatrous service
   is introduced into the temple of God Now we are the true temples of
   God. Hence it is sacrilege to defile ourselves with any contamination
   of idols. This one consideration, I say, should be to you as good as a
   thousand. If you are a Christian, what have you to do with idols,
   (Hosea 14:8,) for you are the temple of God?" Paul, however, as I have
   already in part noticed, contends rather by way of exhortation than of
   doctrine, inasmuch as it would have been superfluous to be still
   treating of it, as if it were a thing doubtful or obscure.

   As God saith, I will walk. He proves that we are the temples of God
   from this, that God of old promised to the people of Israel that he
   would dwell in the midst of them. In the first place, God cannot dwell
   among us, without dwelling in each one of us, for he promises this as a
   singular privilege -- I will dwell in the midst of you Nor does this
   dwelling or presence consist merely in earthly blessings, but must be
   understood chiefly of spiritual grace. Hence it does not mean simply
   that God is near us, as though he were in the air, flying round about
   us, but it means rather that he has his abode in our hearts. If, then,
   any one objects, that the particle in simply means among, I grant it;
   but I affirm that, from the circumstance that God promises that he will
   dwell among us, we may infer that he also remains in us. [619] And such
   was the type of the ark, of which mention is made by Moses in that
   passage, from which Paul appears to have borrowed this quotation.
   (Leviticus 26:12.) If, however, any one thinks that Paul had rather in
   his eye Ezekiel 37:27, the argument will be the same. For the Prophet,
   when describing the restoration of the Church, mentions as the chief
   good, the presence of God, which he had himself in the beginning
   promised by Moses. Now what was prefigured by the ark, was manifested
   to us more fully in Christ, when he became to us Immanuel [620]
   (Matthew 1:23.) On this account, I am of opinion that it is Ezekiel,
   rather than Moses, that is here quoted, because Ezekiel alludes at the
   same time to the type of the ark, and declares that it will have its
   fulfillment under the reign of Christ. Now the Apostle takes it for
   granted, that God dwells nowhere but in a sacred place. If we say of a
   man, "he dwells here," that will not make the place a temple; but as to
   God there is this peculiarity, that whatever place he honors with his
   presence, he at the same time sanctifies.

   17. Wherefore come out from the midst of them. This exhortation is
   taken from Isaiah 52:11, where the Prophet, when foretelling the
   deliverance, at length addresses the priests in these terms. For he
   makes use of a circumlocution to describe the priests, when he says, Ye
   that bear the vessels of the Lord, inasmuch as they had the charge of
   the vessels, by means of which the sacrifices, and other parts of
   divine worship, were performed. There can be no doubt that his design
   is to admonish them, that, while eagerly desirous to come forth, [621]
   they should be on their guard against any contamination from the many
   pollutions with which the country [622] was overrun. Now this is no
   less applicable to us, than to the ancient Levites, for if so much
   purity is required on the part of the keepers of the vessels, how much
   more in the vessels themselves! [623] Now all our members are vessels,
   set apart for the spiritual worship of God; we are also a royal
   priesthood. (1 Peter 2:9.) Hence, as we are redeemed by the grace of
   God, it is befitting that we keep ourselves undefiled in respect of all
   uncleanness, that we may not pollute the sanctuary of God. As, however,
   while remaining in this world, we are nevertheless redeemed, and
   rescued, from the pollutions of the world, so we are not to quit life
   with the view of departing from all uncleanness, but must simply avoid
   all participation. The sum is this. "If with a true affection of the
   heart, we aim at the benefit of redemption, we must beware of defiling
   ourselves by any contamination from its pollutions."

   18. I will be a Father unto you. This promise does not occur in one
   passage merely, but is repeated in various instances. Paul has added it
   with this view, that a recognition of the great honor to which God has
   exalted us, might be a motive to stir us up to a more ardent desire for
   holiness. For when God has restored his Church which he has gathered
   from profane nations, their redemption is attended with this fruit,
   that believers are seen to be his sons and daughters It is no common
   honor that we are reckoned among the sons of God: it belongs to us in
   our turn to take care, that we do not show ourselves to be degenerate
   children to him. For what injury we do to God, if while we call him
   father, we defile ourselves with abominations of idols! Hence, the
   thought of the high distinction to which he has elevated us, ought to
   whet our desire for holiness and purity.

   [602] God promised to Ezekiel that he would give him "the opening of
   the mouth in the midst of the house of Israel," (Ezekiel 29:21,) which
   is explained by Gill to mean, "boldness and courage of speech when he
   should see his prophecies fulfilled." Paul himself makes use of a
   similar expression in Ephesians 6:19, "that utterance may be given unto
   me, that I may open my mouth boldly." -- Ed.

   [603] The same view, in substance, is taken by Chrysostom. -- Kathaper

   wont to expand, so it is the part of love to enlarge. For virtue is
   warm and fervent. It was this that opened Paul's mouth, and enlarged
   his heart." -- Ed.

   [604] "From a tender and considerate regard to the good of the
   Christians at Corinth, he" (Paul) "had determined not to revisit them,
   until their unseemly heats and factions were allayed. How was he
   affected while he waited at Ephesus to receive the tidings of this
   longed-for but protracted issue? O ye Corinthians! our mouth is opened
   unto you; our heart is enlarged!' What a picture of a heart! We see him
   standing on the shore of the gean Sea, over against Corinth, with his
   arms extended towards that city, and in the attitude of speaking. We
   hear the words by which he seeks to relieve his overcharged breast,
   heaving and ready to burst with the fullness of those desires which he
   had long felt to come among them, satisfy them of the sincerity of his
   affection, and replenish their souls with the consolation with which he
   himself had been comforted. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open to you,
   our heart is enlarged! Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are
   straitened in your own bowels. Now, for a recompense in the same, (I
   speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.'" -- M'Crie's Sermons,
   p. 29. -- Ed.

   [605] "Mon coeur mesme s'ouuriroit volontiers pour vous mettre deuant
   les yeux l'affection que i' ay enuers vous;" -- "My very heart would
   willingly open itself up, so as to place before your eyes the affection
   which I entertain towards you."

   [606] The term antipelargia is compounded of anti over against, and
   largos, a stork. It is employed to denote reciprocal affection, from an
   interesting peculiarity in the disposition of the stork. "This bird,"
   says Paxton, in his Illustrations of Scripture, (Edin. 1842,) volume 2,
   p. 432, "has long been celebrated for her amiable and pious
   dispositions, in which she has no rival among the feathered race. Her
   kind benevolent temper she discovers in feeding her parents in the time
   of incubation, when they have not leisure to seek their food, or when
   they have become old, and unable to provide for themselves." The
   English word stork is derived from storge, affection, while the Hebrew
   name for this animal, chsydh, (chasidah,) is derived from chsd
   (chesed,) beneficence, because, says Bythner, "the stork nourishes,
   supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged parents." See
   Calvin on the Psalms, [43]vol. 4, p. 158, n. 2 Calvin, when commenting
   on [44]1Timothy 5:4, says, "Ips' quoque ciconi' gratitudinem suo
   exemplo nos docent. Unde et nomen antipelargia;" -- "The very storks,
   too, teach us gratitude by their example. Hence the term antipelargia
   -- affection in return." -- Ed.

   [607] The rendering of the Vulgate -- "Eandem remunerationem habentes;"
   -- "Having the same reward," -- is followed by. Wiclif, (1380,) ye that
   haw the same reward and also in the Rheims version, (1582,) hauing the
   same reward. -- Ed.

   [610] "Aux infideles;" -- "To unbelievers."

   [611] "Joachim Camerarius, in his Commentary on the New Testament,
   (Cambridge 1642,) suggests, that eterozugountes, may have a reference
   to a balance, and that Paul -- would not have the Corinthians unequally
   balanced with unbelievers. The verb zugostatein, as he observes, is
   employed to denote the adjusting of scales in balance. It seems more
   natural, however, to understand the word, as Calvin and most other
   interpreters do, as derived from heteros, (Another,) and zugos, as
   meaning a yoke, and as employed by Paul to mean, drawing on the other
   side of a yoke with another; or, as Beza explains it, "Qui cum sint
   divers' conditionis, tamen in eodem opere mutuam operam pr'stant;" --
   "Those who, while in a different condition from each other, do
   nevertheless take their corresponding part in the same work." -- Ed.

   [612] Beza, when mentioning the different views which have been taken
   of the etymology of the term Belial, remarks, that some derive it from
   vly yl beli jahal, (not profitable,) or from vly mvyl beli mohil,
   (worthless,) and that the term, viewed as having this derivation, is
   peculiarly appropriate to Satan, as being diametrically opposed to
   Christ, the Greatest and Best; while Jerome derives it from vly beli,
   (not) and yl hol, (a yoke,) as though you should say -- without a yoke,
   not subject to the yoke. Beza gives the preference to the former
   etymology, while he observes that the latter is also most appropriate
   to Satan as an apostate spirit. -- The original term Belial is rendered
   in various instances in the Septuagint paranomos, lawless. -- There is
   here a slight variation in reading. The Edit. Princ. and the Textus
   Receptus have Belial. The Erasmian, Stephanic, and other early editions
   have Beliar, which has been restored by Bengelius, Matthias, Griesbach,
   and Tittmann; and justly, for both external and internal evidence are
   in its favor; it being found in the majority of the MSS., in many early
   ecclesiastical writers, and Greek Fathers." -- Bloomfield. -- Ed

   [613] "Et assez notoire;" -- "And is sufficiently well known."

   thy wicked heart." The expression made use of is phk-ychyh dvr m-lvvk
   vlyl "Lest there be in thine heart a thing of Belial." The same
   expression occurs in Psalm 41:9, where David's enemies represent him as
   suffering the punishment of detestable wickedness,dvr vlyl a thing of

   CHAPTER 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 7:1

   1. Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God.

   1. Has igitur promissiones quum habeamus, dilecti, mundemus nos ab omni
   inquinamento carnis et spiritus, sanctificationem perficientes in
   timore Dei.


   1. These promises, therefore. God, it is true, anticipates us in his
   promises by his pure favor; but when he has, of his own accord,
   conferred upon us his favor, he immediately afterwards requires from us
   gratitude in return. Thus what he said to Abraham, I am thy God,
   (Genesis 17:7,) was an offer of his undeserved goodness, yet he at the
   same time added what he required from him -- Walk before me, and be
   thou perfect As, however, this second clause is not always expressed,
   Paul instructs us that in all the promises this condition is implied,
   [624] that they must be incitements to us to promote the glory of God.
   For from what does he deduce an argument to stimulate us? It is from
   this, that God confers upon us such a distinguished honor. Such, then,
   is the nature of the promises, that they call us to sanctification, as
   if God had interposed by an implied agreement. We know, too, what the
   Scripture teaches in various passages in reference to the design of
   redemption, and the same thing must be viewed as applying to every
   token of his favor.

   From all filthiness of flesh and spirit. Having already shown, that we
   are called to purity, [625] he now adds, that it ought to be seen in
   the body, as well as in the soul; for that the term flesh is taken here
   to mean the body, and the term spirit to mean the soul, is manifest
   from this, that if the term spirit meant the grace of regeneration,
   Paul's statement in reference to the pollution of the spirit would be
   absurd. He would have us, therefore, pure from defilements, not merely
   inward, such as have God alone as their witness; but also outward, such
   as fall under the observation of men. "Let us not merely have chaste
   consciences in the sight of God. We must also consecrate to him our
   whole body and all its members, that no impurity may be seen in any
   part of us." [626]

   Now if we consider what is the point that he handles, we shall readily
   perceive, that those act with excessive impudence, [627] who excuse
   outward idolatry on I know not what pretexts. [628] For as inward
   impiety, and superstition, of whatever kind, is a defilement of the
   spirit, what will they understand by defilement of the flesh, but an
   outward profession of impiety, whether it be pretended, or uttered from
   the heart? They boast of a pure conscience; that, indeed, is on false
   grounds, but granting them what they falsely boast of, they have only
   the half of what Paul requires from believers. Hence they have no
   ground to think, that they have given satisfaction to God by that half;
   for let a person show any appearance of idolatry at all, or any
   indication of it, or take part in wicked or superstitious rites, even
   though he were -- what he cannot be -- perfectly upright in his own
   mind, he would, nevertheless, not be exempt from the guilt of polluting
   his body.

   Perfecting holiness. As the verb epitelein in Greek sometimes means, to
   perfect, and sometimes to perform sacred rites, [629] it is elegantly
   made use of here by Paul in the former signification, which is the more
   frequent one -- in such a way, however, as to allude to sanctification,
   of which he is now treating. For while it denotes perfection, it seems
   to have been intentionally transferred to sacred offices, because there
   ought to be nothing defective in the service of God, but everything
   complete. Hence, in order that you may sanctify yourself to God aright,
   you must dedicate both body and soul entirely to him.

   In the fear of God. For if the fear of God influences us, we will not
   be so much disposed to indulge ourselves, nor will there be a bursting
   forth of that audacity of wantonness, which showed itself among the
   Corinthians. For how does it happen, that many delight themselves so
   much in outward idolatry, and haughtily defend so gross a vice, unless
   it be, that they think that they mock God with impunity? If the fear of
   God had dominion over them, they would immediately, on the first
   moment, leave off all cavils, without requiring to be constrained to it
   by any disputations.

   2 Corinthians 7:2-7

   2. Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
   have defrauded no man.

   2. Capaces estote nostri: nemini fecimus iniuriam, neminem corrupimus,
   neminem fraudavimus.

   3. I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are
   in our hearts to die and live with you

   3. Non [hoc] ad condemnationem vestri dico: siquidem iam ante dixi
   vobis, quod in coribus nostris sitis ad commoriendum et convivendum.

   4. Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
   you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our
   tribulation.

   4. Multa mihi fiducia erga vos, multa mihi gloriatio de vobis: impletus
   sum consolatione supra modum, exundo gaudio in omni tribulatione
   nostra.

   5. For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we
   were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.

   5. Etenim quum venissemus in Macedoniam, nullam relaxationem habuit
   caro nostra, sed in omnibus fuimus afflicti: foris pugnae, intus
   timores.

   6. Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
   comforted us by the coming of Titus;

   6. Sed qui consolatur humiles, consolatus est nos Deus in adventu Titi.

   7. And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was
   comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning,
   your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.

   7. Neque solum in adventu eius, sed in consolatione quam acceperat de
   vobis, annuntians nobis vestrum desiderium, vestras lacrimas, vestrum
   stadium pro me: ita ut magis gauderem.


   2. Make room for us. Again he returns from a statement of doctrine to
   treat of what more especially concerns himself, but simply with this
   intention -- that he may not lose his pains in admonishing the
   Corinthians. Nay more, he closes the preceding admonition with the same
   statement, which he had made use of by way of preface. For what is
   meant by the expressions Receive us, or Make room for us? It is
   equivalent to, Be ye enlarged, (2 Corinthians 6:13;) that is, "Do not
   allow corrupt affections, or unfavorable apprehensions, to prevent this
   doctrine from making its way into your minds, and obtaining a place
   within you. For as I lay myself out for your salvation with a fatherly
   zeal, it were unseemly that you should turn a deaf ear [630] upon me."
   [631]

   We have done injury to no man. He declares that there is no reason why
   they should have their minds alienated, [632] inasmuch as he had not
   given them occasion of offense in any thing. Now he mentions three
   kinds of offenses, as to which he declares himself to be guiltless. The
   first is, manifest hurt or injury. The second is, the corruption that
   springs from false doctrine. The third is, defrauding or cheating in
   worldly goods. These are three things by which, for the most part,
   pastors [633] are wont to alienate the minds of the people from them --
   when they conduct themselves in an overbearing manner, and, making
   their authority their pretext, break forth into tyrannical cruelty or
   unreasonableness, -- or when they draw aside from the right path those
   to whom they ought to have been guides, and infect them with the
   corruption of false doctrine, -- or when they manifest an insatiable
   covetousness, by eagerly desiring what belongs to another. Should any
   one wish to have it in shorter compass-the first is, fierceness and an
   abuse of power by excessive insolence [634] the second, unfaithfulness
   in teaching. the third, avarice.

   3. I say not this to condemn you. As the foregoing apology was a sort
   of expostulation, and we can scarcely avoid reproaching when we
   expostulate, he softens on this account what he had said. "I clear
   myself," says he, "in such a way as to be desirous to avoid, what would
   tend to your dishonor." The Corinthians, it is true, were unkind, and
   they deserved that, on Paul's being acquitted from blame, they should
   be substituted in his place as the guilty party; nay more, that they
   should be held guilty in two respects -- in respect of ingratitude, and
   on the ground of their having calumniated the innocent. Such, however,
   is the Apostle's moderation, that he refrains from recrimination,
   contenting himself with standing simply on the defensive.

   For I have before said. Those that love do not assail; [635] nay more,
   if any fault has been committed, they either cover it over by taking no
   notice of it, or soften it by kindness. For a disposition to reproach
   is a sign of hatred. Hence Paul, with the view of showing that he has
   no inclination to distress the Corinthians, declares his affection
   towards them. At the same time, he undoubtedly in a manner condemns
   them, while he says that he does not do so. As, however, there is a
   great difference between gall and vinegar, so there is also between
   that condemnation, by which we harass a man in a spirit of hatred, with
   the view of blasting him with infamy, and, on the other hand, that, by
   which we endeavor to bring back an offender into the right way, that,
   along with safety, he may in addition to this regain his honors
   unimpaired.

   Ye are in our hearts -- that is, "I carry you about with me inclosed in
   my heart." To die and live with you -- that is, "So that no change can
   loosen our attachment, for I am prepared not merely to live with you,
   but also to be associated with you in death, if necessary, and to
   endure anything rather than renounce your friendship." Mark well, in
   what manner all pastors. [636] ought to be affected.

   4. Great is my boldness. Now, as if he had obtained the enlargement of
   heart that he had desired on the part of the Corinthians, he leaves off
   complaining, and pours out his heart with cheerfulness. "What need is
   there that I should expend so much labor upon a matter already
   accomplished? For I think I have already what I asked. For the things
   that Titus has reported to me respecting you are not merely sufficient
   for quieting my mind, but afford me also ground of glorying confidently
   on your account [637] Nay more, they have effectually dispelled the
   grief, which many great and heavy afflictions had occasioned me." He
   goes on step by step, by way of climax; for glorying is more than being
   of an easy and quiet mind; and being freed from grief occasioned by
   many afflictions, is greater than either of those. Chrysostom explains
   this boldness somewhat differently, in this manner -- "If I deal with
   you the more freely, it is on this account, that, relying on the
   assurance of your good will towards me, I think I may take so much
   liberty with you." I have stated, however, what appeared to me to be
   the more probable meaning -- that the report given by Titus had removed
   the unfavorable impression, which had previously racked his mind. [638]

   5. For when we had come into Macedonia The heaviness of his grief tends
   to show, how efficacious the consolation was. "I was pressed on every
   side," says he, "by afflictions both internal and external. All this,
   however, has not prevented the joy that you have afforded me from
   prevailing over it, and even overflowing." [639] When he says that he
   had no rest in his flesh, it is as if he had said -- "As a man, I had
   no relief." [640] For he excepts spiritual consolations, by which he
   was in the mean time sustained. He was afflicted, therefore, not merely
   in body, but also in mind, so that, as a man, he experienced nothing
   but great bitterness of afflictions.

   Without were fightings By fightings he means outward assaults, with
   which his enemies molested him: fears he means the anxieties, that he
   endured on account of the internal maladies of the Church, for it was
   not so much by personal as by public evils, that he was disquieted.
   What he means, then, to say is this -- that there were not merely
   avowed enemies that were hostile to him, but that he endured,
   nevertheless, much distress in consequence of domestic evils. For he
   saw how great was the infirmity of many, nay of almost all, and in the
   mean time what, and how diversified, were the machinations, by which
   Satan attempted to throw every thing into confusion -- how few were
   wise, how few were sincere, how few were steadfast, and how many, on
   the other hand, were either mere pretenders, and worthless, or
   ambitious, or turbulent. Amidst these difficulties, the servants of God
   must of necessity feel alarmed, and be racked with anxieties; and so
   much the more on this account -- that they are constrained to bear many
   things silently, that they may consult the peace of the Churches. Hence
   he expressed himself with propriety when he said -- Without were
   fightings; within were fears. For faithful pastors openly set
   themselves in opposition to those enemies that avowedly attack Christ's
   kingdom, but they are inwardly tormented, and endure secret tortures,
   when they see the Church afflicted with internal evils, for the
   exterminating of which they dare not openly sound the trumpet. [641]
   But although he had almost incessant conflicts, it is probable that he
   was at that time more severely pressed than usual. The servants of
   Christ, undoubtedly, have scarcely at any time exemption from fears,
   and Paul was seldom free from outward fightings; but as he was at that
   time more violently oppressed, he makes use of the plural number --
   fightings and fears, meaning that he required to fight in many ways,
   and against various enemies, and that he had at the same time many
   kinds of fear.

   6. Who comforteth the lowly. This is mentioned as a reason; for he
   means that consolation had been offered to him, because he was borne
   down with evils, and almost overwhelmed, inasmuch as God is wont to
   comfort the lowly, that is, those that are cast down. Hence a most
   profitable doctrine may be inferred -- that the more we have been
   afflicted, so much the greater consolation has been prepared for us by
   God. Hence, in the epithet here applied to God, there is a choice
   promise contained, as though he had said, that it is peculiarly the
   part of God to comfort those that are miserable and are abased to the
   dust.

   7. And not by his coming only. Lest the Corinthians should object in
   these terms -- "What is it to us if Titus has cheered you by his
   coming? No doubt, as you loved him, you would feel delighted to see
   him;" he declares, that the occasion of his joy was, that Titus had, on
   returning from them, communicated the most joyful intelligence.
   Accordingly he declares, that it was not so much the presence of one
   individual, as the prosperous condition of the Corinthians, that had
   cheered him.

   Your desire Mark, what joyful tidings were communicated to Paul
   respecting the Corinthians. Their desire originated in the
   circumstance, that they held Paul's doctrine in high estimation. Their
   tears were a token of respect; because, being affected with his
   reproof, they mourned over their sins. Their zeal was an evidence of
   good will. From these three things he inferred that they were penitent.
   This afforded him full satisfaction, because he had no other intention
   or anxiety, than the consulting of their welfare.

   So that I rejoiced the more -- that is, "So that all my griefs and
   distresses gave way to joy." Hence we see, not merely with what fervor
   of mind he desired the public good of the Church, but also how mild and
   gentle a disposition he possessed, as being one that could suddenly
   bury in oblivion offenses of so serious a nature. At the same time,
   this may rather be taken in another way, so as to be viewed in
   connection with what follows, and I am not sure but that this meaning
   would correspond better with Paul's intention. As, however, it is a
   matter of no great moment, I pass over it slightly.

   [632] "De luy ou de sa doctrine;" -- "From him or from his doctrine."

   [633] "Les ministres et pasteurs;" -- "Ministers and pastors."

   [634] "Quand on est arrogant, et on abuse de la puissance en se
   desbordant et vsurpant plus qu'il ne faut;" -- "When one is
   presumptuous, and abuses his power by going beyond bounds and assuming
   more than he ought."

   [635] "Ceux qui aiment vn autre, ne prenent point plaisir ale
   poursuyure et picquer;" -- "Those who love another take no pleasure in
   pursuing and stinging him."

   [636] "Pasteurs et ministres;" -- "Pastors and ministers."

   [637] "Timothy is despatched" (by Paul) "to Corinth, and after him
   Titus is sent. In the mean time, a door is opened of the Lord' to the
   Apostles to preach Christ's gospel at Troas; but, strange to relate! he
   who panted so earnestly for such opportunities, had neither heart nor
   tongue to improve the present. The expected messenger from Corinth had
   not arrived -- he had no rest in his spirit,' and abandoning the rich
   harvest which invited his labors, he wandered into Macedonia. Nor yet
   did he find ease: For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had
   no rest, but we were troubled on every side -- without were fightings;
   within were fears.' At last Titus arrives with tidings from Corinth.
   The Apostle's letter had been well received; it had produced the
   intended effects; a spirit of repentance had fallen upon the Church;
   they had applied themselves vigorously to the correction of abuses; the
   love which they bore to their spiritual father had revived with
   additional strength. Now! thanks be unto God, who always causeth us to
   triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by
   us in every place!' Great is my boldness of speech towards you, great
   is my glorying of you; I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful
   in all our tribulation.' (2 Corinthians 2:14; 2 Corinthians 7:4.) What
   a sudden change! what a wonderful transformation! Formerly we saw him
   like a soldier, wounded, weak, disabled, dispirited, fallen to the
   ground; now he is lifted up, victorious, and borne on the triumphant
   car." -- M'Crie's Sermons, p. 39. -- Ed.

   [638] ^"La mauuaise opinion ou le souspecon qu'il auoit d'eux, et dont
   il estoit tourmente en son coeur;" -- "The bad opinion or suspicion
   that he had of them, and with which he had been tormented in his
   heart."

   [639] Calvin here has manifestly in his eye the singularly emphatic
   word made use of by Paul in the preceding verse -- huperperisseuomai, I
   am exceeding joyful. "The word here used occurs nowhere else in the New
   Testament except in Romans 5:20. It is not found in the classic
   writers, and is a word which Paul evidently compounded, (from huper and
   perisseuo,) and means to superabound over, to superabound greatly, or
   exceedingly. It is a word which would be used only when the heart was
   full, and when it would be difficult to find words to express its
   conceptions. Paul's heart was full of joy, and he pours forth his
   feelings in the most fervid and glowing language -- I have joy which
   cannot be expressed.'" -- Barnes. -- Ed.

   2 Corinthians 7:8-11

   8. For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I
   did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry,
   though it were but for a season.

   8. Quoniam et si contristavi vos in epistola, non me poenitet: etiamsi
   poenituerit. Video enim, quod epistola illa, et si ad tempus, vos
   contristavit.

   9. Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to
   repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might
   receive damage by us in nothing.

   9. Nunc gaudeo: non quod sitis contristati, sed quod sitis contristati
   in poenitentiam, contristati enim estis secundum Deum, ita ut nulla in
   re damno affecti sitis ex nobis.

   10. For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
   of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

   10. Nam quae secundum Deum est tristitia, poenitentiam ad salutem non
   poenitendam efficit: mundi autem tristitia mortem efficit.

   11. For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
   sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
   yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement
   desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge!

   11. Ecce enim hoc ipsum, quod secundum Deum, contristati estis quantum
   produxit in vobis stadium! Imo defensionem, imo indignationem, imo
   timorem, imo desiderium, imo zelum, imo vindictam!


   8. For though I grieved you. He now begins to apologize to the
   Corinthians for having handle them somewhat roughly in the former
   Epistle. Now we must observe, in what a variety of ways he deals with
   them, so that it might appear as though he sustained different
   characters. The reason is that his discourse was directed to the whole
   of the Church. There were some there, that entertained an unfavorable
   view of him -- there were others that held him, as he deserved, in the
   highest esteem -- some were doubtful: others were confident -- some
   were docile: others were obstinate. [642] In consequence of this
   diversity, he required to direct his discourse now in one way, then in
   another, in order to suit himself to all. Now he lessens, or rather he
   takes away altogether any occasion of offense, on account of the
   severity that he had employed, on the ground of its having turned out
   to the promotion of their welfare. "Your welfare," says he, "is so much
   an object of desire to me, that I am delighted to see that I have done
   you good." This softening-down is admissible only when the teacher
   [643] has done good so far as was needed, by means of his reproofs; for
   if he had found, that the minds of the Corinthians still remained
   obstinate, and had he perceived an advantage arising from the
   discipline that he had attempted, he would, undoubtedly, have abated
   nothing from his former severity. It is to be observed, however, that
   he rejoices to have been an occasion of grief to those whom he loved;
   for he was more desirous to profit, than to please them.

   But what does he mean when he adds -- though I did repent? For if we
   admit, that Paul had felt dissatisfied with what he had written, there
   would follow an inconsistency of no slight character -- that the former
   Epistle had been written under a rash impulse, rather than under the
   guidance of the Spirit. I answer, that the word repent is used here in
   a loose sense for being grieved. For while he made the Corinthians sad,
   he himself also participated in the grief, and in a manner inflicted
   grief at the same time upon himself. "Though I gave you pain against my
   inclination, and it grieved me to be under the necessity of being harsh
   to you, I am grieved no longer on that account, when I see that it has
   been of advantage to you." Let us take an instance from the case of a
   father; for a father feels grief in connection with his severity, when
   at any time he chastises his son, but approves of it, notwithstanding,
   because he sees that it is conducive to his son's advantage. In like
   manner Paul could feel no pleasure in irritating the minds of the
   Corinthians; but, being conscious of the motive that influenced his
   conduct, he preferred duty to inclination.

   For I see. The transition is abrupt; but that does not at all impair
   the distinctness of the sense. In the first place, he says, that he had
   fully ascertained by the effect, that the former Epistle, though for a
   time unwelcome, had nevertheless at length been of advantage, and
   secondly, that he rejoiced on account of that advantage.

   9. Not because you have been made sorry. He means, that he feels no
   pleasure whatever in their sorrow -- nay more, had he his choice, he
   would endeavor to promote equally their welfare and their joy, by the
   same means; but that as he could not do otherwise, their welfare was of
   so much importance in his view, that he rejoiced that they had been
   made sorry unto repentance. For there are instances of physicians, who
   are, indeed, in other respects good and faithful, but are at the same
   time harsh, and do not spare their patients. Paul declares, that he is
   not of such a disposition as to employ harsh cures, when not
   constrained by necessity. As, however, it had turned out well, that he
   had made trial of that kind of cure, he congratulates himself on his
   success. He makes use of a similar form of expression in 2 Corinthians
   5:4,

   We in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, because we are desirous
   not to be unclothed, but clothed upon.

   10. Sorrow according to God [644] In the first place, in order to
   understand what is meant by this clause according to God, we must
   observe the contrast, for the sorrow that is according to God he
   contrasts with the sorrow of the world Let us now take, also, the
   contrast between two kinds of joy. The joy of the world is, when men
   foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity, that is,
   in the world, and, intoxicated with a transient felicity, look no
   higher than the earth. The joy that is according to God is, when men
   place all their happiness in God, and take satisfaction in His grace,
   and show this by contempt of the world, using earthly prosperity as if
   they used it not, and joyful in the midst of adversity. Accordingly,
   the sorrow of the world is, when men despond in consequence of earthly
   afflictions, and are overwhelmed with grief; while sorrow according to
   God is that which has an eye to God, while they reckon it the one
   misery -- to have lost the favor of God; when, impressed with fear of
   His judgment, they mourn over their sins. This sorrow Paul makes the
   cause and origin of repentance. This is carefully to be observed, for
   unless the sinner be dissatisfied with himself, detest his manner of
   life, and be thoroughly grieved from an apprehension of sin, he will
   never betake himself to the Lord. [645] On the other hand, it is
   impossible for a man to experience a sorrow of this kind, without its
   giving birth to a new heart. Hence repentance takes its rise in grief,
   for the reason that I have mentioned -- because no one can return to
   the right way, but the man who hates sin; but where hatred of sin is,
   there is self-dissatisfaction and grief.

   There is, however, a beautiful allusion here to the term repentance,
   when he says -- not to be repented of; for however unpleasant the thing
   is at first taste, it renders itself desirable by its usefulness. The
   epithet, it is true, might apply to the term salvation, equally as to
   that of repentance; but it appears to me to suit better with the term
   repentance "We are taught by the result itself, that grief ought not to
   be painful to us, or distressing. In like manner, although repentance
   contains in it some degree of bitterness, if, is spoken of as not to be
   repented of on account of the precious and pleasant fruit which it
   produces."

   To salvation Paul seems to make repentance the ground of salvation.
   Were it so, it would follow, that we are justified by works. I answer,
   that we must observe what Paul here treats of, for he is not inquiring
   as to the ground of salvation, but simply commending repentance from
   the fruit which it produces, he says that it is like a way by which we
   arrive at salvation. Nor is it without good reason; for Christ calls us
   by way of free favor, but it is to repentance. (Matthew 9:13.) God by
   way of free favor pardons our sins, but only when we renounce them. Nay
   more, God accomplishes in us at one and the same time two things: being
   renewed by repentance, we are delivered from the bondage of our sins;
   and, being justified by faith, we are delivered also from the curse of
   our sins. They are, therefore, inseparable fruits of grace, and, in
   consequence of their invariable connection, repentance may with fitness
   and propriety be represented as an introduction to salvation, but in
   this way of speaking of it, it is represented as an effect rather than
   as a cause. These are not refinements for the purpose of evasion, but a
   true and simple solution, for, while Scripture teaches us that we never
   obtain forgiveness of sins without repentance, it represents at the
   same time, in a variety of passages, the mercy of God alone as the
   ground of our obtaining it.

   11. What earnest desire it produced in you I shall not enter into any
   dispute as to whether the things that Paul enumerates are effects of
   repentance, or belong to it, or are preparatory to it, as all this is
   unnecessary for understanding Paul's design, for he simply proves the
   repentance of the Corinthians from its signs, or accompaniments. At the
   same time he makes sorrow according to God to be the source of all
   these things, inasmuch as they spring from it -- which is assuredly the
   case; for when we have begun to feel self-dissatisfaction, we are
   afterwards stirred up to seek after the other things.

   What is meant by earnest desire, we may understand from what is opposed
   to it; for so long as there is no apprehension of sin, we lie drowsy
   and inactive. Hence drowsiness or carelessness, or unconcern, [646]
   stands opposed to that earnest desire, that he makes mention of.
   Accordingly, earnest desire means simply an eager and active assiduity
   in the correcting of what is amiss, and in the amendment of life.

   Yea, what clearing of yourselves Erasmus having rendered it
   satisfaction, ignorant persons, misled by the ambiguity of the term,
   have applied it to popish satisfactions, whereas Paul employs the term
   apologian, (defense.) It is on this account that I have preferred to
   retain the word defensionem, which the Old Interpreter had made use of.
   [647] It is, however, to be observed, that it is a kind of defense that
   consists rather in supplication for pardon, than in extenuation of sin.
   As a son, who is desirous to clear himself to his father, does not
   enter upon a regular pleading of his cause, but by acknowledging his
   fault excuses himself, rather in the spirit of a suppliant, than in a
   tone of confidence, hypocrites, also, excuse themselves -- nay more,
   they haughtily defend themselves, but it is rather in the way of
   disputing with God, than of returning to favor with him; and should any
   one prefer the word excusationem, (excuse,) I do not object to it;
   because the meaning will amount to the same thing, that the Corinthians
   were prompted to clear themselves, whereas previously they cared not
   what Paul thought of them.

   Yea, what indignation [648] This disposition, also, is attendant on
   sacred sorrow -- that the sinner is indignant against his vices, and
   even against himself, as also all that are actuated by a right zeal
   [649] are indignant, as often as they see that God is offended. This
   disposition, however, is more intense than sorrow. For the first step
   is, that evil be displeasing to us. The second is, that, being inflamed
   with anger, we press hard upon ourselves, so that our consciences may
   be touched to the quick. It may, however, be taken here to mean the
   indignation, with which the Corinthians had been inflamed against the
   sins of one or a few, whom they had previously spared. Thus they
   repented of their concurrence or connivance.

   Fear is what arises from an apprehension of divine judgment, while the
   offender thinks -- "Mark it well, an account must be rendered by thee,
   and what wilt thou advance in the presence of so great a judge?" For,
   alarmed by such a consideration, he begins to tremble.

   As, however, the wicked themselves are sometimes touched with an alarm
   of this nature, he adds desire This disposition we know to be more of a
   voluntary nature than fear, for we are often afraid against our will,
   but we never desire but from inclination. Hence, as they had dreaded
   punishment on receiving Paul's admonition, so they eagerly aimed at
   amendment.

   But what are we to understand by zeal? There can be no doubt that he
   intended a climax. Hence it means more than desire Now we may
   understand by it, that they stirred up each other in a spirit of mutual
   rivalry. It is simpler, however, to understand it as meaning, that
   every one, with great fervor of zeal, aimed to give evidence of his
   repentance. Thus zeal is intensity of desire.

   Yea, what revenge What we have said as to indignation, must be applied
   also to revenge; for the wickedness which they had countenanced by
   their connivance and indulgence, they had afterwards shown themselves
   rigorous in avenging. They had for some time tolerated incest; but, on
   being admonished by Paul, they had not merely ceased to countenance
   him, but had been strict reprovers in chastening him, -- this was the
   revenge that was meant. As, however, we ought to punish sins wherever
   they are, [650] and not only so, but should begin more especially with
   ourselves, there is something farther meant in what the Apostle says
   here, for he speaks of the signs of repentance. There is, among others,
   this more particularly -- that, by punishing sins, we anticipate, in a
   manner, the judgment of God, as he teaches elsewhere, If we would judge
   ourselves, we would not be judged by the Lord. (1 Corinthians 11:31.)
   We are not, however, to infer from this, that mankind, by taking
   vengeance upon themselves, compensate to God for the punishment due to
   him, [651] so that they redeem themselves from his hand. The case
   stands thus -- that, as it is the design of God by chastising us, to
   arouse us from our carelessness, that, being reminded of his
   displeasure, we may be on our guard for the future, when the sinner
   himself is beforehand in inflicting punishment of his own accord, the
   effect is, that he no longer stands in need of such an admonition from
   God.

   But it is asked, whether the Corinthians had an eye to Paul, or to God,
   in this revenge, as well as in the zeal, and desire, and the rest.
   [652] I answer, that all these things are, under all circumstances,
   attendant upon repentance, but there is a difference in the case of an
   individual sinning secretly before God, or openly before the world. If
   a person's sin is secret, it is enough if he has this disposition in
   the sight of God; on the other hand, where the sin is open, there is
   required besides an open manifestation of repentance. Thus the
   Corinthians, who had sinned openly and to the great offense of the
   good, required to give evidence of their repentance by these tokens.

   2 Corinthians 7:11-16

   11. In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this
   matter.

   11. Modis omnibus comprobastis vos puros esse in negotio.

   12. Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that
   had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our
   care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.

   12. Itaque si scripsi vobis, non eius causa qui laeserat, neque eius
   causa qui laesus fuerat, scripsi: sed ut palam fieret stadium vestrum
   pro nobis apud vos, (vel, stadium nostrum in nobis erga vos,) in
   conspectu Dei.

   13. Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
   the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was
   refreshed by you all.

   13. Idcirco consolatione vestri: quin uberius etiam gavisi sumus ob
   gaudium Titi, quod refocillatus sit eius spiritus ab omnibus vobis.

   14. For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
   but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which
   I made before Titus, is found a truth.

   14. Quodsi quid apud illum de vobis gloriatus sum, non fuerim
   pudefactus: sed ut omnia in veritate loquuti sumus vobis, ita et
   gloriatio nostra apud Titum veritas facta est.

   15. And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
   remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye
   received him.

   15. Et viscera eius maiorem in modum erga vos affecta sunt: dum memoria
   repetit vestram omnium obedientiam, quemadmodum cum timore et tremore
   exceperitis eam.

   16. I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things

   16. Gaudeo, quod vobis in omnibus confidam.


   11. Ye have approved yourselves to be clear. The Old Interpreter reads,
   "Ye have shown yourselves." Erasmus renders it, "Ye have commended
   yourselves." I have preferred a third rendering, which appeared to me
   to suit better -- that the Corinthians showed by clear evidences, that
   they were in no degree participants in the crime, with which they had
   appeared, from their connivance, to have had some connection. What
   those evidences were, we have already seen. At the same time, Paul does
   not altogether clear them, but palliates their offense. For the undue
   forbearance, which they had exercised, was not altogether free from
   blame. He acquits them, however, from the charge of concurrence. [653]
   We must farther observe, that he does not acquit all of them without
   exception, but merely the body of the Church. For it may readily be
   believed, that some were concerned in it, and countenanced it; but,
   while all of them together were involved in disgrace, it afterwards
   appeared that only a few were in fault.

   12. Wherefore if I wrote. He acts as persons are wont to do, that are
   desirous of a reconciliation. He wishes all past things to be buried,
   he does not any more reproach them, he does not reprove them for any
   thing, he does not expostulate as to any thing; in fine, he forgets
   every thing, inasmuch as he was satisfied with their simply repenting.
   And, certainly, this is the right way -- not to press offenders
   farther, when they have been brought to repentance. For if we still

   call their sins to remembrance, (1 Kings 17:18,)

   it is certain that we are actuated by malevolence, rather than by pious
   affection, or a desire for their welfare. These things, however, are
   said by Paul by way of concession, for, unquestionably, he had followed
   up the offense that he had taken, and had felt desirous that the author
   of this offense should be chastised, but now he puts his foot upon what
   had been in some degree offensive. "I am now desirous, that whatever I
   have written may be looked upon as having been written with no other
   view, than that you might perceive your affection towards me. As to all
   other things, let us now leave them as they are." Others explain it in
   this way, -- that he had not regard to one individual in particular,
   but consulted the common advantage of all. The former interpretation,
   however, is the more natural one.

   Your concern for us. As this reading occurs very generally in the Greek
   versions, I have not ventured to go so far as to erase it, though at
   the same time in one ancient manuscript the reading is hemon, (of us,)
   [654] and it appears from Chrysostom s Commentaries, that the Latin
   rendering [655] was more commonly received in his times even among the
   Greeks -- that our concern for you might become manifest to you, that
   is, that it might be manifest to the Corinthians, how much concerned
   Paul was in regard to them. The other rendering, however, in which the
   greater part of the Greek manuscripts concur, is, notwithstanding, a
   probable one. For Paul congratulates the Corinthians on their having
   learned at length, through means of this test, how they stood affected
   towards him. "You were not yourselves aware of the attachment that you
   felt towards me, until you had trial of it in this matter." Others
   explain it as referring to the particular disposition of an individual,
   in this way: "That it might be manifest among you, how much respect
   each of you entertained for me, and that, through the occurrence of
   this opportunity, each of you might discover what had previously been
   concealed in his heart." As this is not of great moment, my readers are
   at liberty, so far as I am concerned, to make choice of either; but, as
   he adds at the same time, in the sight of God, I rather think that he
   meant this -- that each of them, having made a thorough search, as if
   he had come into the presence of God, [656] had come to know himself
   better than before.

   13. We received consolation. Paul was wholly intent upon persuading the
   Corinthians, that nothing was more eagerly desired by him than their
   advantage. Hence he says, that he had shared with them in their
   consolation. Now their consolation had been this -- that, acknowledging
   their fault, they did not merely take the reproof in good part, but had
   received it joyfully. For the bitterness of a reproof is easily
   sweetened, so soon as we begin to taste the profitableness of it to us.

   What he adds -- that he rejoiced more abundantly on account of the
   consolation of Titus, is by way of congratulation. Titus had been
   overjoyed in finding them more obedient and compliant than could have
   been expected -- nay more, in his finding a sudden change for the
   better. Hence we may infer, that Paul's gentleness was anything but
   flattery, inasmuch as he rejoiced in their joy, so as to be, at the
   same time, chiefly taken up with their repentance.

   14. But if I have boasted any thing to him. He shows indirectly, how
   friendly a disposition he had always exercised towards the Corinthians,
   and with what sincerity and kindness he had judged of them; for at the
   very time that they seemed to be unworthy of commendation, he still
   promised much that was honorable on their behalf. Here truly we have a
   signal evidence of a rightly constituted and candid mind, -- reproving
   to their face those that you love, and yet hoping well, and giving
   others good hopes respecting them. Such sincerity ought to have induced
   them not to take amiss any thing that proceeded from him. In the mean
   time, he takes this opportunity of setting before them again, in
   passing, his fidelity in all other matters. "You have hitherto had
   opportunity of knowing my candor, so that I have shown myself to be
   truthful, and not by any means fickle. I rejoice, therefore, that I
   have now also been found truthful, when boasting of you before others."

   15. His bowels more abundantly. As the bowels are the seat of the
   affections, the term is on that account employed to denote compassion,
   love, and every pious affection. [657] He wished, however, to express
   emphatically the idea, that while Titus had loved the Corinthians
   previously, he had been, at that time, more vehemently stirred up to
   love them; and that, from the innermost affections of his heart. Now,
   by these words he insinuates Titus into the affections of the
   Corinthians, as it is of advantage that the servants of Christ should
   be loved, that they may have it in their power to do the more good. He
   at the same time encourages them to go on well, that they may render
   themselves beloved by all the good.

   With fear and trembling. By these two words he sometimes expresses
   simply respect, (Ephesians 6:5,) and this perhaps would not suit ill
   with this passage, though I should have no objection to view the
   trembling as mentioned particularly to mean, that, being conscious of
   having acted amiss, they were afraid to face him. It is true that even
   those, that are resolute in their iniquities, tremble at the sight of
   the judge, but voluntary trembling, that proceeds from ingenuous shame,
   is a sign of repentance. Whichever exposition you may choose, this
   passage teaches, what is a right reception for the ministers of Christ.
   Assuredly, it is not sumptuous banquets, it is not splendid apparel, it
   is not courteous and honorable salutations, it is not the plaudits of
   the multitude, that gratify the upright and faithful pastor. He
   experiences, on the other hand, an overflowing of delight, when the
   doctrine of salvation is received with reverence from his mouth, when
   he retains the authority that belongs to him for the edification of the
   Church, when the people give themselves up to his direction, to be
   regulated by his ministry under Christ's banners. An example of this we
   see here in Titus. He at length, in the close, confirms again, what he
   had previously stated -- that he had never been offended to such a
   degree, as altogether to distrust the Corinthians.

   CHAPTER 8
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 8:1-7

   1. Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on
   the churches of Macedonia;

   1. Certiores autem vos facio, fratres, de gratia Dei, quae data est in
   Ecclesiis Macedoniae;

   2. How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy
   and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

   2. Quoniam in multa probatione afflictionis exsuperavit gaudium
   ipsorum, et profunda illorum paupertas exundavit in divitias
   simplicitatis [658] eorum.

   3. For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power, they
   were willing of themselves;

   3. Nam pro viribus (testor) atque etiam supra vires fuerunt voluntarii;

   4. Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and
   take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.

   4. Multa cum obtestatione rogantes nos, ut gratiam et societatem
   ministrii susciperemus in sanctos.

   5. And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves
   to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

   5. Ac non quatenus sperabamus: sed se ipsos dediderunt, primum Domino,
   deinde et nobis per voluntatem Dei:

   6. Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
   also finish in you the same grace also.

   6. Ut abhortaremur Titum, ut quemadmodum ante coepisset, ita et
   consummaret erga vos hanc quoque gratiam.

   7. Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and
   knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us; see that ye
   abound in this grace also.

   7. Verum quemadmodum ubique abundatis fide, et scientia, et omnia
   diligentia, et ea, quae ex vobis erga nos est caritate: facite, ut in
   hac quoque beneficentia abundetis.


   As, in the event of the Corinthians retaining any feeling of offense,
   occasioned by the severity of the preceding Epistle, that might stand
   in the way of Paul's authority having influence over them, he has
   hitherto made it his endeavor to conciliate their affections. Now,
   after clearing away all occasion of offense, and regaining favor for
   his ministry, he recommends to them the brethren at Jerusalem, that
   they may furnish help to their necessities. He could not, with any
   great advantage, have attempted this in the commencement of the
   Epistle. Hence, he has prudently deferred it, until he has prepared
   their minds for it. Accordingly, he takes up the whole of this chapter,
   and the next, in exhorting the Corinthians to be active and diligent in
   collecting alms to be taken to Jerusalem for relieving the indigence of
   the brethren. For they were afflicted with a great famine, so that they
   could scarcely support life without being aided by other churches. The
   Apostles had intrusted Paul with this matter, (Galatians 2:10,) and he
   had promised to concern himself in reference to it, and he had already
   done so in part, as we have seen in the former Epistle. [659] Now,
   however, he presses them still farther.

   1. I make known to you. He commends the Macedonians, but it is with the
   design of stimulating the Corinthians by their example, although he
   does not expressly say so; for the former had no need of commendation,
   but the latter had need of a stimulus. And that he may stir up the
   Corinthians the more to emulation, he ascribes it to the grace of God
   that the Macedonians had been so forward to give help to their
   brethren. For although it is acknowledged by all, that it is a
   commendable virtue to give help to the needy, they, nevertheless, do
   not reckon it to be a gain, nor do they look upon it as the grace of
   God Nay rather, they reckon, that it is so much of what was theirs
   taken from them, and lost. Paul, on the other hand, declares, that we
   ought to ascribe it to the grace of God, when we afford aid to our
   brethren, and that it ought to be desired by us as a privilege of no
   ordinary kind.

   He makes mention, however, of a twofold favor, that had been conferred
   upon the Macedonians. The first is, that they had endured afflictions
   with composure and cheerfulness. The second is, that from their slender
   means, equally as though they had possessed abundance, [660] they had
   taken something -- to be laid out upon their brethren. Each of these
   things, Paul affirms with good reason, is a work of the Lord, for all
   quickly fail, that are not upheld by the Spirit of God, who is the
   Author of all consolation, and distrust clings to us, deeply rooted,
   which keeps us back from all offices of love, until it is subdued by
   the grace of the same Spirit.

   2. In much trial -- In other words, while they were tried with
   adversity, they, nevertheless, did not cease to rejoice in the Lord:
   nay, this disposition rose so high, as to swallow up sorrow; for the
   minds of the Macedonians, which must otherwise have been straitened,
   required to be set free from their restraints, that they might
   liberally [661] furnish aid to the brethren.

   By the term joy he means that spiritual consolation by which believers
   are sustained under their afflictions; for the wicked either delude
   themselves with empty consolations, by avoiding a perception of the
   evil, and drawing off the mind to rambling thoughts, or else they
   wholly give way to grief, and allow themselves to be overwhelmed with
   it. Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions of joy in the
   affliction itself, as we see in the 8th chapter of the Romans. [662]

   And their deep poverty. Here we have a metaphor taken from exhausted
   vessels, as though he had said, that the Macedonians had been emptied,
   so that they had now reached the bottom. He says, that even in such
   straits they had abounded in liberality, and had been rich, so as to
   have enough -- not merely for their own use, but also for giving
   assistance to others. Mark the way, in which we shall always be liberal
   even in the most straitened poverty -- if by liberality of mind we make
   up for what is deficient in our coffers.

   Liberality is opposed to niggardliness, as in Romans 12:8, where Paul
   requires this on the part of deacons. For what makes us more
   close-handed than we ought to be is -- when we look too carefully, and
   too far forward, in contemplating the dangers that may occur -- when we
   are excessively cautious and careful -- when we calculate too narrowly
   what we will require during our whole life, or, in fine, how much we
   lose when the smallest portion is taken away. The man, that depends
   upon the blessing of the Lord, has his mind set free from these
   trammels, and has, at the same time, his hands opened for beneficence.
   Let us now draw an argument from the less to the greater. "Slender
   means, nay poverty, did not prevent the Macedonians from doing good to
   their brethren: What excuse, then, will the Corinthians have, if they
   keep back, while opulent and affluent in comparison of them?"

   3. To their power, and even beyond their power. When he says that they
   were willing of themselves, he means that they were, of their own
   accord, so well prepared for the duty, that they needed no exhortation.
   It was a great thing -- to strive up to the measure of their ability;
   and hence, to exert themselves beyond their ability, showed a rare, and
   truly admirable excellence. [663] Now he speaks according to the common
   custom of men, for the common rule of doing good is that which Solomon
   prescribes, (Proverbs 5:15) --

   to drink water out of our own fountains, and let the rivulets go past,
   that they may flow onwards to others. [664]

   The Macedonians, on the other hand, making no account of themselves,
   and almost losing sight of themselves, concerned themselves rather as
   to providing for others. [665] In fine, those that are in straitened
   circumstances are willing beyond their ability, if they lay out any
   thing upon others from their slender means.

   4. Beseeching us with much entreaty. He enlarges upon their
   promptitude, inasmuch as they did not only not wait for any one to
   admonish them, but even besought those, by whom they would have been
   admonished, had they not anticipated the desires of all by their
   activity. [666] We must again repeat the comparison formerly made
   between the less and the greater. "If the Macedonians, without needing
   to be besought, press forward of their own accord, nay more, anticipate
   others by using entreaties, how shameful a thing is it for the
   Corinthians to be inactive, more especially after being admonished! If
   the Macedonians lead the way before all, how shameful a thing is it for
   the Corinthians not, at least, to imitate their example! But what are
   we to think, when, not satisfied with beseeching, they added to their
   requests earnest entreaty, and much of it too?" Now from this it
   appears, that they had besought, not as a mere form, but in good
   earnest.

   That the favor and the fellowship. The term favor he has made use of,
   for the purpose of recommending alms, though at the same time the word
   may be explained in different ways. This interpretation, however,
   appears to me to be the more simple one; because, as our heavenly
   Father freely bestows upon us all things, so we ought to be imitators
   of his unmerited kindness in doing good, (Matthew 5:45); or at least,
   because, in laying out our resources, we are simply the dispensers of
   his favor. The fellowship of this ministry consisted in his being a
   helper to the Macedonians in this ministry. They contributed of their
   own, that it might be administered to the saints. They wished, that
   Paul would take the charge of collecting it.

   5. And not as He expected from them an ordinary degree of willingness,
   such as any Christian should manifest; but they went beyond his
   expectation, inasmuch as they not only had their worldly substance in
   readiness, but were prepared to devote even themselves. They gave
   themselves, says he, first to God, then to us.

   It may be asked, whether their giving themselves to God, and to Paul,
   were two different things. It is quite a common thing, that when God
   charges or commands through means of any one, he associates the person
   whom he employs as his minister, both in authority to enjoin, and in
   the obedience that is rendered.

   It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us;

   say the Apostles, (Acts 15:28,) while at the same time they merely, as
   instruments, declared what had been revealed and enjoined by the
   Spirit. Again,

   The people believed the Lord and his servant Moses,
   (Exodus 14:31,)

   while at the same time Moses had nothing apart from God. This, too, is
   what is meant by the clause that follows -- by the will of God For, as
   they were obedient to God, who had committed themselves to his
   ministry, to be regulated by his counsel, they were influenced by this
   consideration in listening to Paul, as speaking from God's mouth.

   6. That we should exhort Titus. Now this is an exhortation that is of
   greater force, when they learn that they are expressly summoned to
   duty. [667] Nor was it offensive to the Macedonians, that he was
   desirous to have the Corinthians as partners in beneficence. In the
   mean time an apology is made for Titus, that the Corinthians may not
   think that he pressed too hard upon them, as if he had not confidence
   in their good disposition. For he did that, from having been entreated,
   and it was rather in the name of the Macedonians, than in his own.

   7. But as He had already been very careful to avoid giving offense,
   inasmuch as he said, that Titus had entreated them, not so much from
   his own inclination, as in consideration of the charge given him by the
   Macedonians. Now, however, he goes a step farther, by admonishing them,
   that they must not even wait for the message of the Macedonians being
   communicated to them; and that too, by commending their other virtues.
   "You ought not merely to associate yourselves as partners with the
   Macedonians, who require that; but surpass them in this respect, too,
   as you do in others."

   He makes a distinction between utterance and faith, because it. is
   impossible that any one should have faith, and that, too, in an eminent
   degree, without being at the same time much exercised in the word of
   God. Knowledge I understand to mean, practice and skill, or prudence.
   He makes mention of their love to himself, that he may encourage them
   also from regard to himself personally, and in the mean time he gives
   up, with a view to the public advantage of the brethren, the personal
   affection with which they regarded him. [668] Now in this way he lays a
   restraint upon himself in everything, that he may not seem to accuse
   them when exhorting them.

   2 Corinthians 8:8-12

   8. I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
   others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

   8. Non secundum imperium loquor, sed per aliorum sollicitudinem, et
   vestrae dilectionis sinceritatem approbans.

   9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was
   rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty
   might be rich.

   9. Nostis enim gratiam Domini nostri Iesu Christi, quod propter vos
   pauper factus sit, quum esset dives: ut vos illius paupertate
   ditesceretis.

   10. And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who
   have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

   10. Et consilium in hoc do: nam hoc vobis conducit: qui quidem non
   solum facere, verum etiam velle coepistis anno superiore.

   11. Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
   readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which
   ye have.

   11. Nunc autem etiam illud quod facere coepistis, perficite: ut
   quemadmodum voluntas prompta fuit, ita et perficiatis ex eo quod
   suppetit.

   12. For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
   that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

   12. Etenim si iam adest animi promptitudo, ea iuxta id quod quisque
   possidet, accepta est: non iuxta id quod non possidet.


   8. I speak not according to commandment Again he qualifies his
   exhortation, by declaring that he did not at all intend to compel them,
   as if he were imposing any necessity upon them, for that is to speak
   according to commandment, when we enjoin any thing definite, and
   peremptorily require that it shall be done. Should any one ask -- "Was
   it not lawful for him to prescribe what he had by commandment of the
   Lord?" The answer is easy -- that God, it is true, everywhere charges
   us to help the necessities of our brethren, but he nowhere specifies
   the sum; [669] that, after making a calculation, we might divide
   between ourselves and the poor. He nowhere binds us to circumstances of
   times, or persons, but calls us to take the rule of love as our guide.

   At the same time, Paul does not here look to what is lawful for him, or
   unlawful, but says, that he does not command as if he reckoned that
   they required to be constrained by command and requirement, as though
   they refused to do their duty, unless shut up to it by necessity. He
   assigns, on the other hand, two reasons why he, notwithstanding, stirs
   them up to duty: first, Because the concern felt by him for the saints
   compels him to do so; and, secondly, Because he is desirous, that the
   love of the Corinthians should be made known to all. For I do not
   understand Paul to have been desirous to be assured of their love, (as
   to which he had already declared himself to be perfectly persuaded,)
   [670] but he rather wished that all should have evidence of it. At the
   same time, the first clause in reference to the anxiety of others,
   admits of two meanings -- either that he felt an anxiety as to the
   individuals, which did not allow him to be inactive, or that, yielding
   to the entreaties of others, who had the matter at heart, he spoke not
   so much from his own feeling, as at the suggestion of others.

   9. For ye know the grace. Having made mention of love, he adduces
   Christ as an all perfect and singular pattern of it. "Though he was
   rich," says he, "he resigned the possession of all blessings, that he
   might enrich us by his poverty." He does not afterwards state for what
   purpose he makes mention of this, but leaves it to be considered by
   them; for no one can but perceive, that we are by this example stirred
   up to beneficence, that we may not spare ourselves, when help is to be
   afforded to our brethren.

   Christ was rich, because he was God, under whose power and authority
   all things are; and farther, even in our human nature, which he put on,
   as the Apostle bears witness, (Hebrews 1:2; Hebrews 2:8,) he was the
   heir of all things, inasmuch as he was placed by his Father over all
   creatures, and all things were placed under his feet. He nevertheless
   became poor, because he refrained from possessing, and thus he gave up
   his right for a time. We see, what destitution and penury as to all
   things awaited him immediately on his coming from his mother's womb. We
   hear what he says himself, (Luke 9:58,)

   The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests: the Son of
   man hath not where to lay his head.

   Hence he has consecrated poverty in his own person, that believers may
   no longer regard it with horror. By his poverty he has enriched us all
   for this purpose -- that we may not feel it hard to take from our
   abundance what we may lay out upon our brethren.

   10. And in this I give my advice. The advice he places in contrast with
   the commandment of which he had spoken a little before. (2 Corinthians
   8:8.) "I merely point out what is expedient in the way of advising or
   admonishing." Now this advantage is not perceived by the judgment of
   the flesh; for where is the man to be found, who is persuaded that it
   is of advantage to deprive himself of something with the view of
   helping others? It is, indeed, the saying of a heathen -- "What you
   have given away is the only riches that you will always have; [671] but
   the reason is, that whatever is given to friends is placed beyond all
   risk." The Lord, on the other hand, would not have us influenced by the
   hope of a reward, or of any remuneration in return, but, on the
   contrary, though men should be ungrateful, so that we may seem to have
   lost what we have given away, he would have us, not- withstanding,
   persevere in doing good. The advantage, however, arises from this --
   that

   "He that giveth to the poor (as Solomon says in Proverbs 19:17) lendeth
   to the Lord,"

   whose blessing, of itself, is to be regarded as a hundredfold more
   precious than all the treasures of the world. The word useful, however,
   is taken here to mean honorable, or at least Paul measures what is
   useful by what is honorable, because it would have been disgraceful to
   the Corinthians to draw back, or to stop short in the middle of the
   course, when they had already advanced so far. At the same time it
   would also have been useless, inasmuch as everything that they had
   attempted to do would have come short of acceptance in the sight of
   God.

   Who had begun not only to do. As doing is more than willing, the
   expression may seem an improper one; but willing here is not taken
   simply, (as we commonly say,) but conveys the idea of spontaneous
   alacrity, that waits for no monitor. For there are three gradations, so
   to speak, as to acting. First, we sometimes act unwillingly, but it is
   from shame or fear. Secondly, we act willingly, but at the same time it
   is from being either impelled, or induced from influence, apart from
   our own minds. Thirdly, we act from the prompting of our own minds,
   when we of our own accord set ourselves to do what is becoming. Such
   cheerfulness of anticipation is better than the actual performance of
   the deed. [672]

   11. Now what ye have begun to do. It is probable, that the ardor of the
   Corinthians had quickly cooled down: otherwise they would, without any
   delay, have prosecuted their purpose. The Apostle, however, as though
   no fault had as yet been committed, gently admonishes them to complete,
   what had been well begun.

   When he adds -- from what you have, he anticipates an objection; for
   the flesh is always ingenious in finding out subterfuges. Some plead
   that they have families, which it were inhuman to neglect; others, on
   the ground that they cannot give much, make use of this as a pretext
   for entire exemption. Could I give so small a sum? All excuses of this
   nature Paul removes, when he commands every one to contribute according
   to the measure of his ability. He adds, also, the reason: that God
   looks to the heart -- not to what is given, for when he says, that
   readiness of mind is acceptable to God, according to the individual's
   ability, his meaning is this -- "If from slender resources you present
   some small sum, your disposition is not less esteemed in the sight of
   God, than in the case of a rich man's giving a large sum from his
   abundance. (Mark 12:44.) For the disposition is not estimated according
   to what you have not, that is, God does by no means require of thee,
   that thou coldest contribute more than thy resources allow." In this
   way none are excused; for the rich, on the one hand, owe to God a
   larger offering, and the poor, on the other hand, ought not to be
   ashamed of their slender resources.

   [671] Calvin, it is to be observed, quotes the same sentiment, when

   instance he takes occasion, most appropriately to his particular
   purpose, to notice the connection in which the poet introduces it,
   which is as follows: -- "Callidus effracta nummos fur auferet arca;
   Prosternet patrios impia flamma Lares.
   Extra fortunam est, quicquid donatur amicis;
   Quas dederis, solas semper habebis opes " "The dexterous thief will

   base incendiary, will lay in the dust your paternal mansion; but
   whatever has been given to friends is placed beyond all risk. What you
   have given away is the only wealth that you will always retain." --
   MARTIAL, Ephesians 5:39-42. It is mentioned by Dr. Bennett, in his
   Lectures on Christ's Preaching, (p. 104,) that on the tomb of Robert of
   Doncaster, there was the following inscription -- "What I gave, I have;
   what I kept I lost." -- Ed.

   [672] "Vne telle promptitude de s'auancer a faire sans estre incite ou
   aduerti d'ailleurs, est plus que le faict mesme;" -- "Such promptitude
   in being forward to act, without requiring to be stirred up or
   admonished by any one, is more than the deed itself"

   2 Corinthians 8:13-17

   13. For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

   13. Non enim ut aliis relaxatio sit, vobis autem angustia: sed ut ex
   aequabilitate.

   14. But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a
   supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for
   your want: that there may be equality:

   14. In praesenti tempore vestra copia illorum succurrat inopiae: et
   illorum copia vestrae succurrat inopiae, quo fiat aequabilitas.

   15. As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and
   he that had gathered little had no lack.

   15. Quemadmodum scriptum est (Exodus 16:18.) Qwui multum habebat, huic
   nihil superfluit: et qui paulum habebat, is nihilominus habuit.

   16. But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
   heart of Titus for you.

   16. Gratia autem Deo, qui dedit eandem sollicitudinem pro vobis in
   corde Titi,

   17. For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of
   his own accord he went unto you.

   17. Qui exhortationem acceperit: quin potius, quum esset diligentior,
   suapte sponte ad vos venerit.


   13. Not that others. This is a confirmation of the preceding statement
   -- that a readiness of will is well-pleasing to God alike in poverty
   and in wealth, inasmuch as God does not mean that we should be reduced
   to straits, in order that others may be at ease through our liberality.
   True, indeed, it is certain, that we owe to God, not merely a part, but
   all that we are, and all that we have, but in His kindness He spares us
   thus far, that He is satisfied with that participation of which the
   Apostle here speaks, What he teaches here you must understand to mean
   an abatement from the rigor of law. [673] In the mean time, it is our
   part to stir ourselves up from time to time to liberality, because we
   must not be so much afraid of going to excess in this department. The
   danger is on the side of excessive niggardliness.

   This doctrine, however, is needful in opposition to fanatics, who think
   that you have done nothing, unless you have stripped yourself of every
   thing, so as to make every thing common; [674] and, certainly, they
   gain this much by their frenzy, that no one can give alms with a quiet
   conscience. Hence we must carefully observe Paul's (epieikeia)
   mildness, [675] and moderation, in stating that our alms are
   well-pleasing to God, when we relieve the necessity of our brethren
   from our abundance -- not in such a way that they are at ease, and we
   are in want, but so that we may, from what belongs to us, distribute,
   so far as our resources allow, and that with a cheerful mind. [676]

   By an equality Equality may be taken in two senses, either as meaning a
   mutual compensation, when like is given for like, or, as meaning a
   proper adjustment. I understand isoteta simply as meaning -- an
   equality of proportional right, [677] as Aristotle terms it. [678] In
   this signification it is made use of, also, in Colossians 4:1, where he
   exhorts "masters to give to their servants what is equal." He certainly
   does not mean, that they should be equal in condition and station, but
   by this term he expresses that humanity and clemency, and kind
   treatment, which masters, in their turn, owe to their servants. Thus
   the Lord recommends to us a proportion of this nature, that we may, in
   so far as every one's resources admit, afford help to the indigent,
   that there may not be some in affluence, and others in indigence. Hence
   he adds -- at the present time. At that time, indeed, necessity pressed
   upon them. Hence we are admonished that, in exercising beneficence, we
   must provide for the present necessity, if we would observe the true
   rule of equity.

   14. And their abundance It is uncertain, what sort of abundance he
   means. Some interpret it as meaning, that this had been the case,
   inasmuch as the Gospel had flowed out to them from the Church at
   Jerusalem, from which source they had, in their penury, been assisted
   by their spiritual riches. This, I think, is foreign to Paul's
   intention. It ought rather, in my opinion, to be applied to the
   communion of saints, which means, that whatever duty is discharged to
   one member, redounds to the advantage of the entire body. "If it is
   irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are of no value,
   consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these too, far
   more precious, with which you may be enriched by those who are poor as
   to worldly substance. This participation, which Christ has established
   among the members of his body, should animate you to be more forward,
   and more active in doing good." The meaning may, also, be this. "You
   now relieve them according to the necessity of the occasion, but they
   will have an opportunity given them at another time of requiting you."
   [679] I approve rather of the other sentiment, which is of a more
   general nature, and with this accords what he again repeats in
   reference to equality. For the system of proportional right in the
   Church is this -- that while they communicate to each other mutually
   according to the measure of gifts and of necessity, this mutual
   contribution produces a befitting symmetry, though some have more, and
   some less, and gifts are distributed unequally. [680]

   15. As it is written. The passage, that Paul quotes, refers to the
   manna, but let us hear what the Lord says by Moses. He would have this
   to serve as a never-failing proof, that men do not live by bread alone,
   but are Divinely supported, by the secret influence of His will, who
   maintains and preserves all things that he has created. Again, in
   another passage, (Deuteronomy 8:3,) Moses admonishes them, that they
   had been nourished for a time with such food, that they might learn
   that men are supported -- not by their own industry or labor, but by
   the blessing of God. Hence it appears, that in the manna, as in a
   mirror, there is presented to us an emblem of the ordinary food that we
   partake of. Let us now come to the passage that Paul quotes. When the
   manna had fallen, they were commanded to gather it in heaps, so far as
   every one could, though at the same time, as some are more active than
   others, there was more gathered by some than was necessary for daily
   use, [681] yet no one took for his own private use more than an homer,
   [682] for that was the measure that was prescribed by the Lord. This
   being the case, all had as much as was sufficient, and no one was in
   want. This we have in Exodus 16:18

   Let us now apply the history to Paul's object. The Lord has not
   prescribed to us an homer, or any other measure, according to which the
   food of each day is to be regulated, but he has enjoined upon us
   frugality and temperance, and has forbidden, that any one should go to
   excess, taking advantage of his abundance. Let those, then, that have
   riches, whether they have been left by inheritance, or procured by
   industry and efforts, consider that their abundance was not intended to
   be laid out in intemperance or excess, but in relieving the necessities
   of the brethren. For whatever we have is manna, from whatever quarter
   it comes, provided it be really ours, inasmuch as riches acquired by
   fraud, and unlawful artifices, are unworthy to be called so, but are
   rather quails sent forth by the anger of God. (Numbers 11:31.) And as
   in the case of one hoarding the manna, either from excessive greed or
   from distrust, what was laid up immediately putrified, so we need not
   doubt that the riches, that are heaped up at the expense of our
   brethren, are accursed, and will soon perish, and that too, in
   connection with the ruin of the owner; so that we are not to think that
   it is the way to increase, if, consulting our own advantage for a long
   while to come, we defraud our poor brethren of the beneficence that we
   owe them. [683] I acknowledge, indeed, that there is not enjoined upon
   us an equality of such a kind, as to make it unlawful for the rich to
   live in any degree of greater elegance than the poor; but an equality
   is to be observed thus far -- that no one is to be allowed to starve,
   and no one is to hoard his abundance at the expense of defrauding
   others. The poor man's homer [684] will be coarse food and a spare
   diet; the rich man's homer will be a more abundant portion, it is true,
   according to his circumstances, but at the same time in such a way that
   they live temperately, and are not wanting to others.

   16. But thanks be to God who hath put. That he may leave the
   Corinthians without excuse, he now at length adds, that there had been
   provided for them active prompters, who would attend to the matter.
   And, in the first place, he names Titus, who, he says, had been
   divinely raised up. This was of great importance in the case. For his
   embassy would be so much the more successful, if the Corinthians
   recognized him as having come to them, from having been stirred up to
   it by God. From this passage, however, as from innumerable others, we
   infer that there are no pious affections that do not proceed from the
   Spirit of God; [685] and farther, that this is an evidence of God's
   concern for his people, that he raises up ministers and guardians, to
   make it their endeavor to relieve their necessities. But if the
   providence of God shows itself in this manner, in providing the means
   of nourishment for the body, how much greater care will he exercise as
   to the means of spiritual nourishment, that his people may not be in
   want of them! Hence it is His special and peculiar work to raise up
   pastors. [686]

   His receiving the exhortation means that he had undertaken this
   business, [687] from being exhorted to it by Paul. He afterwards
   corrects this by saying, that Titus had not been so much influenced by
   the advice of others, as he had felt stirred up of his own accord, in
   accordance with his active disposition.

   2 Corinthians 8:18-24

   18. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
   gospel throughout all the churches;

   18. Misimus autem una cum illo fratrem, cuius laus est in Evangelio per
   omnes Ecclesias.

   19. And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to
   travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the
   glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:

   19. Nec id solum, verum etiam delectus ab Ecclesiis est comes
   peregrinationis nostrae, cum hac beneficentia [688] quae administratur
   a nobis, ad eiusdem Domini gloriam, et animi vestri promptitudinem:

   20. Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which
   is administered by us:

   20. Declinantes hoc, ne quis nos carpat in hac exsuperantia, quae
   administratur a nobis.

   21. Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but
   also in the sight of men.

   21. Procurantes honesta, non tantum coram Deo, sed etiam coram
   hominibus.

   22. And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
   proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the
   great confidence which I have in you.

   22. Misimus autem una cum illis fratrem nostrum, quem probaveramus in
   multis saepenumero diligentem; nunc autem multo diligentiorem, ob
   multam fiduciam quam habeo ergo vos:

   23. Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper
   concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers
   of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

   23. Sive Titi nomine, qui socius meus est, et erga vos adiutor, sive
   aliorum, qui fratres nostri sunt, et Apostoli Ecclesiarum, gloria
   Christi. [689]

   24. Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of
   your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

   24. Proinde documentum caritatis vestrae et nostrae de vobis
   gloriationis erga eos ostendit et in conspectu Ecclesiarum.


   18. We have sent with him the brother. The circumstance that three
   persons are sent, is an evidence, that great expectations were
   entertained respecting the Corinthians, and it became them to be so
   much the more attentive to duty, that they might not disappoint the
   hopes of the Churches. It is uncertain, however, who this second person
   was; only that some conjecture that it was Luke, others that it was
   Barnabas. Chrysostom prefers to consider it to have been Barnabas. I
   agree with him, because it appears that, by the suffrages of the
   Churches, [690] he was associated with Paul as a companion. As,
   however, it is almost universally agreed, that Luke was one of those
   who were the bearers of this Epistle, I have no objection that he be
   reckoned to be the third that is made mention of.

   Now the second person, whoever he may be, he honors with a signal
   commendation, that he had conducted himself as to the gospel in a
   praiseworthy manner, that is, he had earned applause by promoting the
   gospel. For, although Barnabas gave place to Paul in the department of
   speaking, yet in acting they both concurred. He adds farther, that he
   had received praise, not from one individual, or even from one Church
   merely, but from all the Churches. To this general testimony he
   subjoins a particular one, that is suitable to the subject in hand --
   that he had been chosen for this department by the concurrence of the
   Churches. Now it was likely, that this honor would not have been
   conferred upon him, had he not been long before known to be qualified
   for it. We must observe, however, the mode of election -- that which
   was customary among the Greeks -- cheirotonia, (a show of hands,) [691]
   in which the leaders [692] took the precedence by authority and
   counsel, and regulated the whole proceeding, while the common people
   intimated their approval. [693]

   19. Which is administered by us. By commending his ministry, he still
   farther encourages the Corinthians. He says, that it tends to promote
   the glory of God, and their kindness of disposition. Hence it comes,
   that these two things are conjoined -- the glory of God and their
   liberality, and that the latter cannot be given up without the former
   being proportionally diminished. There is, in addition to this, the
   labor of those distinguished men, which it were very inconsistent to
   reject, or allow to pass unimproved.

   20. Avoiding this, [694] that no one Lest any one should think, that
   the Churches had an unfavorable opinion of Paul, as if it had been from
   distrusting his integrity that they had associated partners with him,
   as persons that are suspected are wont to have guards set over them, he
   declares that he had been the adviser of this measure, with the view of
   providing against calumnies. Here some one will ask, "Would any one
   have been so impudent, as to venture to defame with even the slightest
   suspicion the man, whose fidelity must have been, in all quarters,
   beyond every surmise?" I answer, Who is there that will be exempt from
   Satan's bite, when even Christ himself was not spared by them? Behold,
   Christ is exposed to the reproaches [695] of the wicked, and shall his
   servants be in safety? (Matthew 10:25.) Nay rather, the more upright a
   person is, in that proportion does Satan assail him by every kind of
   contrivance, if he can by any means shake his credit, for there would
   arise from this a much greater occasion of stumbling. [696] Hence the
   higher the station in which we are placed, we must so much the more
   carefully imitate Paul's circumspection and modesty. He was not so
   lifted up, as not to be under control equally with any individual of
   the flock. [697] He was not so self-complacent, as to think it beneath
   his station to provide against calumnies. Hence he prudently shunned
   dangers, and used great care not to furnish any wicked person with a
   handle against him. And, certainly, nothing is more apt to give rise to
   unfavorable surmises, than the management of public money.

   21. Providing things honest I am of opinion, that there were not
   wanting, even among the Corinthians, some who would have proceeded so
   far as to revile, if occasion had been allowed them. Hence he wished
   them to know the state of matters, that he might shut the mouths of all
   everywhere. Accordingly he declares, that he is not merely concerned to
   have a good conscience in the sight of God, but also to have a good
   character among men. At the same time, there can be no doubt, that he
   designed to instruct the Corinthians, as well as all others, by his
   example, that, in doing what is right, the opinion of men is not to be
   disregarded. The first thing, [698] it is true, is that the person take
   care, that he be a good man. This is secured, not by mere outward
   actions, but by an upright conscience. The next thing is, that the
   persons, with whom you are conversant, recognize you as such.

   Here, however, the object in view must be looked to. Nothing,
   assuredly, is worse than ambition, which vitiates the best things in
   the world, disfigures, I say, the most graceful, and makes sacrifices
   of the sweetest smell have an offensive odor before the Lord. Hence
   this passage is slippery, so that care must be taken [699] lest one
   should pretend to be desirous, in common with Paul, of a good
   reputation, and yet be very far from having Paul's disposition, for he
   provided things honest in the sight of men, that no one might be
   stumbled by his example, but that, on the contrary, all might be
   edified. Hence we must, if we would desire to be like him, take care
   that we be not on our own account desirous of a good name. "He that is
   regardless of fame," says Augustine, "is cruel, because it is not less
   necessary before our neighbor, than a good conscience is before God."
   This is true, provided you consult the welfare of your brethren with a
   view to the glory of God, and in the mean time are prepared to bear
   reproaches and ignominy in place of commendation, if the Lord should
   see it meet. Let a Christian man, however, always take care to frame
   his life with a view to the edification of his neighbors, and
   diligently take heed, that the ministers of Satan shall have no pretext
   for reviling, to the dishonor of God and the offense of the good.

   22. On account of the great confidence. The meaning is, "I am not
   afraid of their coming to you proving vain and fruitless; for I have
   felt beforehand an assured confidence, that their embassy will have a
   happy issue; I am so well aware of their fidelity and diligence." He
   says that the brother, whose name he does not mention, had felt more
   eagerly inclined; partly because he saw that he [700] had a good
   opinion of the Corinthians, partly because he had been encouraged by
   Titus, and partly because he saw many distinguished men apply
   themselves to the same business with united efforts. Hence one thing
   only remained -- that the Corinthians themselves should not be wanting
   on their part. [701]

   In calling them the Apostles of the Churches, he might be understood in
   two senses -- either as meaning that they had been set apart by God as
   Apostles to the Churches, or that they had been appointed by the
   Churches to undertake that office. The second of these is the more
   suitable. They are called also the glory of Christ, for this reason,
   that as he alone is the glory of believers, so he ought also to be
   glorified by them in return. Hence, all that excel in piety and
   holiness are the glory of Christ, because they have nothing but by
   Christ's gift.

   He mentions two things in the close: "See that our brethren behold your
   love," and secondly, "Take care, that it be not in vain that I have
   boasted of you." For autous (to them,) appears to me to be equivalent
   to coram ipsis, (before them,) for this clause does not refer to the
   poor, but to the messengers of whom mention had been made. [702] For he
   immediately afterwards subjoins, that they would not be alone
   witnesses, but in consequence of the report given by them, a report
   would go out even to distant Churches.

   admoneste et censure aussi bien que le plus petit de la bande;" -- "He
   was not so arrogant, as not to be quite willing to be admonished and
   censured equally with the humblest of the band."

   [698] "Le premier et le principal;" -- "The first and the chief thing."

   [699] "Ainsi c'est yci vn passage glissant; et pourtant il faut que
   chacun aduise a soy;" -- "Thus there is here a slippery passage; and
   hence every one must take heed to himself."

   [700] "Sainct Paul;" -- "St. Paul."

   [701] "Que les Corinthiens auisassent a ne defailler point de faire
   leur deuoir de leur coste;" -- "That the Corinthians should take care
   not to fail of doing their duty on their part."

   [702] "Qui estoyent enuoyez comme ambassadeurs vers les Corinthiens;"
   -- "Who had been sent as ambassadors to the Corinthians."

   CHAPTER 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 9:1-5

   1. For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for
   me to write to you:

   1. Nam de subministratione quae fit in sanctos, supervacuum mihi est
   scribere vobis.

   2. For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to
   them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath
   provoked very many.

   2. Novi enim promptitudinem animi vestri, de qua pro vobis gloriatus
   sum apud Macedones: quod Achaia parata sit ab anno superiori: et
   aemulatio vestri excitavit complures.

   3. Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in
   vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

   3. Misi autem fratres, ut ne gloriatio nostra de vobis inanis fiat in
   hac parte: ut, quemadmodum dixi, parati sitis.

   4. Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
   unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same
   confident boasting.

   4. Ne si forte mecum venerint Macedones, et vos deprehenderint
   imparatos, nos pudore suffundamur (ne dicam vos) in hac fiducia
   gloriationis.

   5. Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
   would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof
   ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of
   bounty, and not as of covetousness.

   5. Necessarium ergo existimavi, exhortari fratres, ut ante venirent ad
   vos: ut praepararent qante promissam benedictionem vestram, quo in
   promptu sit, atque ita ut benedictio, [703] non tenacitas.


   This statement may seem at first view to suit ill, or not sufficiently
   well, with what goes before; for he seems to speak of a new matter,
   that he had not previously touched upon, while in reality he is
   following out the same subject. Let the reader, however, observe, that
   Paul treats of the very same matter that he had been treating of before
   -- that it was from no want of confidence that he exhorted the
   Corinthians, and that his admonition is not coupled with any reproof as
   to the past, but that he has particular reasons that influence him. The
   meaning, then, of what he says now is this: "I do not teach you that it
   is a duty to afford relief to the saints, for what need were there of
   this? For that is sufficiently well known to you, and you have given
   practical evidence that you are not prepared to be wanting to them;
   [704] but as I have, from boasting everywhere of your liberality,
   pledged my credit along with yours, this consideration will not allow
   me to refrain from speaking." But for this, such anxious concern might
   have been somewhat offensive to the Corinthians, because they would
   have thought, either that they were reproached for their indolence, or
   that they were suspected by Paul. By bringing forward, however, a most,
   suitable apology, he secures for himself the liberty of not merely
   exhorting them, without giving offense, but even from time to time
   urging them.

   Some one, however, may possibly suspect, that Paul here pretends what
   he does not really think. This were exceedingly absurd; for if he
   reckons them to be sufficiently prepared for doing their duty, why does
   he set himself so vigorously to admonish them? and, on the other hand,
   if he is in doubt as to their willingness, why does he declare it to be
   unnecessary to admonish them? Love carries with it these two things, --
   good hope, and anxious concern. Never would he have borne such a
   testimony in favor of the Corinthians, had he not been fully of the
   mind that he expresses. He had seen a happy commencement: he had hoped,
   that the farther progress of the matter would be corresponding; but as
   he was well aware of the unsteadiness of the human mind, he could not
   provide too carefully against their turning aside from their pious
   design.

   1. Ministering. This term seems not very applicable to those that give
   of their substance to the poor, inasmuch as liberality is deserving of
   a more splendid designation. [705] Paul, however, had in view, what
   believers owe to their fellowmembers. [706] For the members of Christ
   ought mutually to minister to each other. In this way, when we relieve
   the brethren, we do nothing more than discharge a ministry that is due
   to them. On the other hand, to neglect the saints, when they stand in
   need of our aid, is worse than inhuman, inasmuch as we defraud them of
   what is their due.

   2. For which I have boasted. He shows the good opinion that he had of
   them from this, that he had, in a manner, stood forward as their surety
   by asserting their readiness. But what if he rashly asserted more than
   the case warranted? For there is some appearance of this, inasmuch as
   he boasted, that they had been ready a year before with it, while he is
   still urging them to have it in readiness. I answer, that his words are
   not to be understood as though Paul had declared, that what they were
   to give was already laid aside in the chest, but he simply mentioned
   what had been resolved upon among them. This involves no blame in
   respect of fickleness or mistake. It was, then, of this promise that
   Paul spoke. [707]

   3. But I have sent the brethren. He now brings forward the reason --
   why it is that, while entertaining a favorable opinion as to their
   willingness, he, nevertheless, sets himself carefully to exhort them.
   "I consult," says he, "my own good name and yours; for while I promised
   in your name, we would, both of us in common, incur disgrace, if words
   and deeds did not correspond. Hence you ought to take my fears in good
   part."

   4. In this confidence The Greek term being hupostasis the Old
   Interpreter has rendered it substantiam, (substance.) [708] Erasmus
   renders it argumentum, (subject-matter,) but neither is suitable.
   Budaeus, however, observes, that this term is sometimes taken to mean
   boldness, or confidence, as it is used by Polybius when he says, ouch
   houto ten dunamin hos ten hupostasin kai tolman autou katapeplegmenon
   ton enantion -- "It was not so much his bodily strength, as his
   boldness and intrepidity, that proved confounding to the enemy." [709]
   Hence hupotatikos sometimes means one that is bold and confident. [710]
   Now every one must see, how well this meaning accords with Paul's
   thread of discourse. Hence it appears, that other interpreters have,
   through inadvertency, fallen into a mistake.

   5. As a blessing, not in the way of niggardliness In place of blessing,
   some render it collection. I have preferred, however, to render it
   literally, as the Greeks employed the term eulogias to express the
   Hebrew word vrkh, (beracah,) which is used in the sense of a blessing,
   that is, an invoking of prosperity, as well as in the sense of
   beneficence. [711] The reason I reckon to be this, that it is in the
   first instance ascribed to God. [712] Now we know how God blesses us
   efficiently by his simple nod. [713] When it is from this transferred
   to men, it retains the same meaning, -- improperly, indeed, inasmuch as
   men have not the same efficacy in blessing, [714] but yet not
   unsuitably by transference. [715]

   To blessing Paul opposes pleonexian, (grudging,) which term the Greeks
   employ to denote excessive greediness, as well as fraud and
   niggardliness. [716] I have rather preferred the term niggardliness in
   this contrast; for Paul would have them give, not grudgingly, but. with
   a liberal spirit, as will appear still more clearly from what follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [703] "Comme benediction, c'est a dire, son liberal, ou beneficence;"
   -- "As a blessing, that is to say, a liberal gift or kindness."

   [704] "Ou vous espargner en leur endroit;" -- "Or to spare yourselves
   as to what you owe them."

   [705] "Vn titre plus magnifique et honorable;" -- "A more magnificent
   and honorable designation."

   [706] "Ceux qui sont membres d'vn mesme corps auec eux;" -- "Those that
   are members of the same body with themselves."

   [707] "Le Sainct Apostre donc parloit de ceste promesse des
   Corinthiens;" -- "The holy Apostle, therefore, spoke of this promise of
   the Corinthians."

   [708] In Wiclif's version, (1380,) the rendering is, "in this
   substaunce;" Rheims (1582) has, "in this substance."

   [709] The expression here quoted from Polybius, (lib. 6: cap. 53, p.
   691,) is made use of by the historian in relating a heroic exploit of
   Publius Horatius Cocles, who, on occasion of a sudden attempt being
   made upon the city of Rome by Porsena, king of Clusium, the most
   powerful prince at that time in Italy, having stationed himself, with
   singular intrepidity, on the Sublician bridge, along with two others,
   withstood the attack of the enemy, and effectually obstructed their
   progress, until the bridge was cut down from behind, after which he
   leaped into the river, and swam across to his friends in safety, amidst
   the darts of the enemy. In honor of this daring adventure, a statue of
   Cocles, as is stated by Livy, (2:10,) was placed in the Comitium, and a
   grant of land was made to him, as much as he could plow round in one
   day. Raphelius adduces another instance in which Polybius employs
   hupostasis in the same sense -- "When the Rhodians," says he, "perceive
   ten ton Buzantion hupostasai -- the intrepidity of the Byzantians."
   (Pol. lib. 6: p. 440.) -- Ed

   [710] The adjective hupostatikos is used in this sense by Aristotle,
   Eth. End. ii. 5, 5, and the adverb derived from it, hupostatikos, has a
   corresponding signification in Polybius, (lib. 5: cap. 16, p. 508, line
   1,) Tou de basileos hupostatikos phesantos "the king having spoken with
   firmness." -- Ed.

   [711] "Qui signifie tant benediction, c'est a dire vn souhait ou priere
   pour la prosperite d'autruy, que beneficence ou liberalite;" -- "Which
   denotes blessing -- that is to say, a desire or prayer for the
   prosperity of another, as well as beneficence, or liberality."

   [712] "Ie pense que la raison de ceste derniere signification est,
   pource que ce mot est en premier lieu et proprement attribue a Dieu;"
   -- "I think that the reason of this last signification is -- because it
   is in the first place and properly ascribed to God."

   [713] "Par la seule et simple volonte;" -- "By a mere simple exercise
   of the will."

   [714] "Que Dieu ha;" -- "That God has."

   [715] "God's blessing of us, and our blessing of God, differ
   exceedingly. For God blesseth us efficiently, by exhibiting his mercies
   to us. We bless God, not by adding any good to him, but declaratively
   only. God's betedicere is benefacere -- his words are works, but our
   blessing (as Aquinas says) is only recognoscitium, and expressivum --
   an acknowledgment only and celebration of that goodness.which God
   hath." -- Burgesse on 2 Corinthians 1. -- Ed.

   [716] "Qui signifie tant couuoitise exccssiue, ou auarice, que
   chichete, et quand on rogne quelque chose de ce qu'il faudroit donner;"
   -- "Which denotes excessive covetousness or avarice, as well as
   niggardliness, and when one pares off something from what he should
   give."

   2 Corinthians 9:6-9

   6. But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly;
   and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

   6. Hoc autem (est): Qui sementem facit parce, is parce messurus est: et
   qui sementem facit in benedictionibus, [717] in benedictionibus [718]
   etiam metet.

   7. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
   not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

   7. Unusquisque secundum propositum cordis, non ex molestia aut
   necessitate: nam hilarem datorem diligit Deus.

   8. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always
   having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:

   8. Potens est autem Deus efficere, ut tota gratia in vos exuberet: ut
   in omnibus omnem sufficientiam habentes, exuberetis in omne opus bonum.

   9. (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the
   poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

   9. Quemadmodum scriptum est (Psalm 112:9): Dispersit, dedit pauperibus,
   iustitia eius manet in saeculum.


   6. Now the case is this [719] He now commends alms-giving by a
   beautiful similitude, comparing it to sowing. For in sowing, the seed
   is cast forth by the hand, is scattered upon the ground on this side
   and on that, is harrowed, and at length rots; and thus it seems as good
   as lost. The case is similar as to alms-giving. What goes from you to
   some other quarter seems as if it were, diminishing of what you have,
   but the season of harvest will come, when the fruit will be gathered.
   For as the Lord reckons every thing that is laid out upon the poor as
   given to himself, so he afterwards requites it with large interest.
   (Proverbs 19:17.)

   Now for Paul's similitude. He that sows sparingly will have a poor
   harvest, corresponding to the sowing: he that sows bountifully and with
   a full hand, will reap a correspondingly bountiful harvest. Let this
   doctrine be deeply rooted in our minds, that, whenever carnal reason
   keeps us back from doing good through fear of loss, we may immediately
   defend ourselves with this shield -- "But the Lord declares that we are
   sowing." The harvest, however, should be explained as referring to the
   spiritual recompense of eternal life, as well as to earthly blessings,
   which God confers upon the beneficent. For God requites, not only in
   heaven, but also in this world, the beneficence of believers. Hence it
   is as though he had said, "The more beneficent you are to your
   neighbors, you will find the blessing of God so much the more
   abundantly poured out upon you." He again contrasts here blessing with
   sparing, as he had previously done with niggardliness. Hence it
   appears, that it is taken to mean -- a large and bountiful liberality.

   7 Every one according to the purpose of his heart. As he had enjoined
   it upon them to give liberally, this, also, required to be added --
   that liberality is estimated by God, not so much from the sum, as from
   the disposition. He was desirous, it is true, to induce them to give
   largely, in order that the brethren might be the more abundantly aided;
   but he had no wish to extort any thing from them against their will.
   Hence he exhorts them to give willingly, whatever they might be
   prepared to give. He places purpose of heart in contrast with regret
   and constraint. For what we do, when compelled by necessity, is not
   done by us with purpose of heart, but with reluctance. [720] Now the
   necessity meant you must understand to be what is extrinsic, as it is
   called -- that is, what springs from the influence of others. For we
   obey God, because it is necessary, and yet we do it willingly. We
   ourselves, accordingly, in that case impose a necessity of our own
   accord, and because the flesh is reluctant, we often even constrain
   ourselves to perform a duty that is necessary for us. But, when we are
   constrained from the influence of others, having in the mean time an
   inclination to avoid it, if by any means we could, we do nothing in
   that case with alacrity -- nothing with cheerfulness, but every thing
   with reluctance or constraint of mind.

   For God loveth a cheerful giver He calls us back to God, as I said in
   the outset, for alms are a sacrifice. Now no sacrifice is pleasing to
   God, if it is not voluntary. For when he teaches us, that God loveth a
   cheerful giver, he intimates that, on the other hand, the niggardly and
   reluctant are loathed by Him. For He does not wish to lord it over us,
   in the manner of a tyrant, but, as He acts towards us as a Father, so
   he requires from us the cheerful obedience of children. [721]

   8. And God is able Again he provides against the base thought, which
   our infidelity constantly suggests to us. "What! will you not rather
   have a regard to your own interest? Do you not consider, that when this
   is taken away, there will be so much the less left for yourself?" With
   the view of driving away this, Paul arms us with a choice promise --
   that whatever we give away will turn out to our advantage. I have said
   already, that we are by nature excessively niggardly -- because we are
   prone to distrust, which tempts every one to retain with eager grasp
   what belongs to him. For correcting this fault, we must lay hold of
   this promise -- that those that do good to the poor do no less provide
   for their own interests than if they were watering their lands. For by
   alms-givings, like so many canals, they make the blessing of God flow
   forth towards themselves, so as to be enriched by it. What Paul means
   is this: "Such liberality will deprive you of nothing, but God will
   make it return to you in much greater abundance." For he speaks of the
   power of God, not as the Poets do, but after the manner of Scripture,
   which ascribes to him a power put forth in action, the present efficacy
   of which we ourselves feel -- not any inactive power that we merely
   imagine.

   That having all sufficiency in all things He mentions a twofold
   advantage arising from that grace, which he had promised to the
   Corinthians -- that they should have what is enough for themselves, and
   would have something over and above for doing good. By the term
   sufficiency he points out the measure which the Lord knows to be useful
   for us, for it is not always profitable for us, to be filled to
   satiety. The Lord therefore, ministers to us according to the measure
   of our advantage, sometimes more, sometimes less, but in such a way
   that we are satisfied -- which is much more, than if one had the whole
   world to luxuriate upon. In this sufficiency we must abound, for the
   purpose of doing good to others, for the reason why God does us good is
   -- not that every one may keep to himself what he has received, but
   that there may be a mutual participation among us, according as
   necessity may require.

   9. As it is written, He hath dispersed He brings forward a proof from
   Psalms 112:9, where, along with other excellencies of the pious man,
   the Prophet mentions this, too, -- that he will not be wanting in doing
   good, but as water flows forth incessantly from a perennial fountain,
   so the gushing forth of his liberality will be unceasing. Paul has an
   eye to this -- that we be not weary in well doing, (Galatians 6:9,) and
   this is also what the Prophet's words mean. [722]

   2 Corinthians 9:10-15

   10. Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
   your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your
   righteousness;)

   10. Pro qui suppeditat semen seminanti, is et panem in cibum supeditet,
   et multiplicet sementem vestram, et augeat proventus iustitiae vestrae.

   11. Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth
   through us thanksgiving to God.

   11. Ut in omnibus locupletemini in omnem simplicitatem, quae per vos
   producit gratiarum actionem Deo.

   12. For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want
   of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;

   12. Nam ministerium huius functionis [723] non solum supplet ea quae
   desunt sanctis: verum etiam exuberat in hoc, quod per multos agantur
   gratiae Deo:

   13. Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for
   your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your
   liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

   13. Quod per probationem ministrii huius glorificant Deum super
   obedientia consensus vestri in Evangelium Christi: et de simplicatate
   communicationis in ipsos, et in omnes:

   14. And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding
   grace of God in you.

   14. Et precatione eorum pro vobis: qui desiderant vos propter eminentem
   Dei gratiam in vobis.

   15. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

   15. Gratia autem Deo super inenarrabili suo munere.


   10. He that supplieth. A beautieth circumlocution, in place of the term
   God, and full of consolation. [724] For the person that sows seed in
   the proper season, appears when reaping to gather the fruit of his
   labor and industry, and sowing appears as though it were the
   fountainhead from which food flows forth to us. Paul opposes this idea,
   by maintaining that the seed is afforded and the food is furnished by
   the favor of God even to the husbandmen that sow, and who are looked
   upon as supporting themselves and others by their efforts. There is a
   similar statement in Deuteronomy 8:16,18 --

   God fed thee with manna -- food which thy fathers knew not: lest
   perhaps when thou hast come into the land which he shall give thee,
   thou shouldst say, My hand and my strength have gotten, me this wealth;
   for it is the Lord that giveth power to get wealth, etc.

   Supply Here there are two different readings, even in the Greek
   versions. For some manuscripts render the three verbs in the future --
   will supply, will multiply, will increase. [725] In this way, there
   would be a confirmation of the foregoing statement, for it is no rare
   thing with Paul to repeat the same promise in different words, that it
   may be the better impressed upon men's minds. In other manuscripts
   these words occur in the infinitive mood, and it is well known that the
   infinitive is sometimes used in place of the optative. I rather prefer
   this reading, both because it is the more generally received one, and
   because Paul is accustomed to follow up his exhortations with prayers,
   entreating from God what he had previously comprised in his doctrine;
   though at the same time the former reading would not be unsuitable.

   Bread for food He mentions a two-fold fruit of the blessing of God upon
   us -- first, that we have sufficiency for ourselves for the support of
   life; and, secondly, that we have something to lay up for relieving the
   necessities of others. For as we are not born for ourselves merely,
   [726] so a Christian man ought neither to live to himself, nor lay out
   what he has, merely for his own use.

   Under the terms seed, and fruits of righteousness, he refers to alms.
   The fruits of righteousness he indirectly contrasts with those returns
   that the greater number lay up in cellars, barns, and keeping-places,
   that they may, every one of them, cram in whatever they can gather,
   nay, scrape together, so as to enrich themselves. By the former term he
   expresses the means of doing good; by the latter the work itself, or
   office of love; [727] for righteousness is taken here, by synecdoche,
   to mean beneficence. "May God not only supply you with what may be
   sufficient for every one's private use, but also to such an extent,
   that the fountain of your liberality, ever flowing forth, may never be
   exhausted!" If, however, it is one department of righteousness -- as
   assuredly it is not the least [728] -- to relieve the necessities of
   neighbors, those must be unrighteous who neglect this department of
   duty.

   11. May be enriched unto all bountifulness. Again he makes use of the
   term bountifulness, to express the nature of true liberality -- when,

   casting all our care upon God, (1 Peter 5:7,)

   we cheerfully lay out what belongs to us for whatever purposes He
   directs. He teaches us [729] that these are the true riches of
   believers, when, relying upon the providence of God for the sufficiency
   of their support, they are not by distrust kept back from doing good.
   Nor is it without good reason, that he dignifies with the title of
   affluence the satisfying abundance of a mind that is simple, and
   contented with its moderate share; for nothing is more famished and
   starved than the distrustful, who are tormented with an anxious desire
   of having.

   Which produces through you. He commends, in consideration of another
   result, the alms which they were about to bestow -- that they would
   tend to promote the glory of God. He afterwards, too, expresses this
   more distinctly, with amplification, in this way: "Besides the ordinary
   advantage of love, they will also produce thanksgiving." Now he
   amplifies by saying, that thanks will be given to God by many, and
   that, not merely for the liberality itself, by which they have been
   helped, but also for the entire measure of piety among the Corinthians.

   By the term administration, he means what he had undertaken at the
   request of the Churches. Now what we render functionem (service), is in
   the Greek leitourgia term that sometimes denotes a sacrifice, sometimes
   any office that is publicly assigned. [730] Either of them will suit
   this passage well. For on the one hand, it is no unusual thing for alms
   to be termed sacrifices; and, on the other hand, as on occasion of
   offices being distributed among citizens, [731] no one grudges to
   undertake the duty that has been assigned him, so in the Church,
   imparting to others ought to be looked upon as a necessary duty. [732]
   The Corinthians, therefore, and others, by assisting the brethren at
   Jerusalem, presented a sacrifice to God, or they discharged a service
   that was proper, and one which they were bound to fulfill. Paul was the
   minister of that sacrifice, but the term ministry, or service, may also
   be viewed as referring to the Corinthians. It is, however, of no
   particular importance.

   13. By the experiment of that administration The term experiment here,
   as in a variety of other places, means proof or trial [733] For it was
   a sufficient token for bringing the love of the Corinthians to the
   test, -- that they were so liberal to brethren that were at a great
   distance from them. Paul, however, extends it farther -- to their
   concurrent obedience in the gospel. [734] For by such proofs we truly
   manifest, that we are obedient to the doctrine of the gospel. Now their
   concurrence appears from this -- that alms are conferred with the
   common consent of all.

   14. And their prayer He omits no advantage which may be of any use for
   stirring up the Corinthians. [735] In the first place, he has made
   mention of the comfort that believers would experience; secondly, the
   thanksgiving, by means of which God was to be glorified. Nay more, he
   has said that this would be a confession, which would manifest to all
   their unanimous concurrence in faith, and in pious obedience. He now
   adds the reward that the Corinthians would receive from the saints --
   good-will springing from gratitude, [736] and earnest prayers. "They
   will have," says he, "the means of requiting you in return; for they
   will regard you with the love with which they ought, and they will be
   careful to commend you to God in their prayers." At length, as though
   he had obtained his desire, he prepares himself [737] to celebrate the
   praises of God, by which he was desirous to testify the confidence felt
   by him, as though the matter were already accomplished.

   CHAPTER 10
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 10:1-6

   1. Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
   Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold
   toward you:

   1. Pro ipse ego Paulus exhortor vos [738] per lenitatem et
   mansuetudinem Christi, qui secundum faciem humilis quidem sum inter
   vos, absens autem audax sum in vos.

   2. But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with
   that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think
   of us as if we walked according to the flesh.

   2. Rogo autem, ne praesens audeam ea fiducia, qua cogito audax esse in
   quosdam, qui nos aestimant, acsi secundum carnem ambularemus.

   3. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:

   3. Nam in carne ambulantes, non secundum carnem militamus.

   4. (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
   God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

   4. Siquidem arma militiae nostrae non carnilia sunt, sed potentia Deo
   ad destructionem munitionum, quibus consilia destruimus.

   5. Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
   against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought
   to the obedience of Christ;

   5. Et omnem celsitudinem, quae extollitur adversus cognitionem Dei: et
   captivam ducimus omnem cogitationem ad obediendum Christo: [739]

   6. And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your
   obedience is fulfilled.

   6. Et in promptu habemus vindictam adversus omnem inobedientiam, quum
   impleta fuerit vestra obedientia.


   Having finished his exhortation, he now proceeds partly to refute the
   calumnies with which he had been defamed by the false apostles, and
   partly to repress the insolence [740] of certain wicked persons, who
   could not bear to be under restraint. Both parties, with the view of
   destroying Paul's authority, construed the vehemence with which he
   thundered in his Epistles to be thrasodeilian -- (mere bravado,) [741]
   because when present he was not equally prepared to show himself off in
   respect of appearance, and address, but was mean and contemptible.
   "See," said they, "here is a man, that, under a consciousness of his
   inferiority, is so very modest and timid, but now, when at a distance,
   makes a fierce attack! Why is he less bold in speech than in letters?
   Will he terrify us, when he is at a distance, who, when present, is the
   object of contempt? How comes he to have such confidence as to imagine,
   that he is at liberty to do anything with us?" [742] They put speeches
   of this kind into circulation, with the view of disparaging his
   strictness, and even rendering it odious. Paul replies, that he is not
   bold except in so far as he is constrained by necessity, and that the
   meanness of his bodily presence, for which he was held in contempt,
   detracted nothing from his authority, inasmuch as he was distinguished
   by spiritual excellence, not by carnal show. Hence those would not pass
   with impunity, who derided either his exhortations, or his reproaches,
   or his threatenings. The words I myself are emphatic; as though he had
   said, that however the malevolent might blame him for inconstancy, he
   was in reality not changeable, but remained uniformly the same.

   1. I exhort you. The speech is abrupt, as is frequently the case with
   speeches uttered under the influence of strong feeling. The meaning is
   this: "I beseech you, nay more, I earnestly entreat you by the
   gentleness of Christ, not to compel me, through your obstinacy, to be
   more severe than I would desire to be, and than I will be, towards
   those who despise me, on the ground of my having nothing excellent in
   external appearance, and do not recognize that spiritual excellence,
   with which the Lord has distinguished me, and by which I ought rather
   to be judged of."

   The form of entreaty, which he makes use of, is taken from the subject
   in hand, when he says -- by the meekness and gentleness of Christ
   Calumniators took occasion to find fault with him, because his bodily
   presence was deficient in dignity, [743] and because, on the other
   hand, when at a distance, he thundered forth in his Epistles. Both
   calumnies he befittingly refutes, as has been said, but he declares
   here, that nothing delights him more than gentleness, which becomes a
   minister of Christ, and of which the Master himself furnished an
   example.

   Learn of me, says he, for I am meek and lowly.
   My yoke is easy and my burden is light.
   (Matthew 11:29, 30.)

   The Prophet also says of him,

   His voice will not be heard in the streets:
   a bruised reed he shall not break, etc. (Isaiah 42:2, 3.)

   That gentleness, therefore, which Christ showed, he requires also from
   his servants. Paul, in making mention of it, intimates that he is no
   stranger to it. [744] "I earnestly beseech you not to despise that
   gentleness, which Christ showed us in his own person, and shows us
   every day in his servants, nay more, which ye see in me."

   Who in presence He repeats this, as if in the person of his
   adversaries, by way of imitating them. [745] Now he confesses, so far
   as words go, what they upbraided him with, yet, as we shall see, in
   such a way as to concede nothing to them in reality.

   2. I beseech you, that I may not be bold, when I am present. Some
   think, that the discourse is incomplete, and that he does not express
   the matter of his request. [746] I am rather of opinion, however, that
   what was wanting in the former clause is here completed, so that it is
   a general exhortation. "Show yourselves docile and tractable towards
   me, that I may not be constrained to be more severe." It is the duty of
   a good pastor to allure his sheep peacefully and kindly, that they may
   allow themselves to be governed, rather than to constrain them by
   violence. Severity, it is true, is, I acknowledge, sometimes necessary,
   but we must always set out with gentleness, and persevere in it, so
   long as the hearer shews himself tractable. [747] Severity must be the
   last resource. "We must," says he, "try all methods, before having
   recourse to rigor; nay more, let us never be rigorous, unless we are
   constrained to it." In the mean time, as to their reckoning themselves
   pusillanimous and timid, when he had to come to close quarters, he
   intimates that they were mistaken as to this, when he declares that he
   will stoutly resist face to face the contumacious [748] "They despise
   me," says he, "as if I were a pusillanimous person, but they will find
   that I am braver and more courageous than they could have wished, when
   they come to contend in good earnest." From this we see, when it is
   time to act with severity -- after we have found, on trial being made,
   that allurements and mildness have no good effect. "I shall do it with
   reluctance," says Paul, "but still I have determined to do it." Here is
   an admirable medium; for as we must, in so far as is in our power, draw
   men rather than drive them, so, when mildness has no effect, in dealing
   with those that are stern and refractory, rigor must of necessity be
   resorted to: otherwise it will not be moderation, nor equableness of
   temper, but criminal cowardice. [749]

   Who account of us. Erasmus renders it -- "Those who think that we walk,
   as it were, according to the flesh." The Old Interpreter came nearer,
   in my opinion, to Paul's true meaning -- "Qui nos arbitrantur, tanquam
   secundum carnem ambulemus;" -- ("Those who think of us as though we
   walked according to the flesh;" [750] ) though, at the same time, the
   phrase is not exactly in accordance with the Latin idiom, nor does it
   altogether bring out the Apostle's full meaning. For logizesthai is
   taken here to mean -- reckoning or esteeming. [751] "They think of us,"
   says Paul, "or they take this view of us, as though we walked according
   to the flesh."

   To walk according to the flesh, Chrysostom explains to mean -- acting
   unfaithfully, or conducting one's self improperly in his office; [752]
   and, certainly, it is taken in this sense in various instances in
   Paul's writings. The term flesh, however, I rather understand to mean
   -- outward pomp or show, by which alone the false Apostles are
   accustomed to recommend themselves. Paul, therefore, complains of the
   unreasonableness of those who looked for nothing in him except the
   flesh, that is, visible appearance, as they speak, or in the usual
   manner of persons who devote all their efforts to ambition. For as Paul
   did not by any means excel in such endowments, as ordinarily procure
   praise or reputation among the children of this world, (Luke 16:8,) he
   was despised as though he had been one of the common herd. But by whom?
   [753] Certainly, by the ambitious, who estimated him from mere
   appearance, while they paid no regard to what lay concealed within.

   3. For though we walk in the flesh. Walking in the flesh means here --
   living it the world; or, as he expresses it elsewhere,

   being at home in the body. (2 Corinthians 5:6.)

   For he was shut up in the prison of his body. This, however, did not
   prevent the influence of the Holy Spirit from showing itself
   marvelously in his weakness. There is here again a kind of concession,
   which, at the same time, is of no service to his adversaries.

   Those war according to the flesh, who attempt nothing but in dependence
   upon worldly resources, in which alone, too, they glory. They have not
   their confidence placed in the government and guidance of the Holy
   Spirit. Paul declares that he is not one of this class, inasmuch as he
   is furnished with other weapons than those of the flesh and the world.
   Now, what he affirms respecting himself is applicable, also, to all
   true ministers of Christ. [754] For they

   carry an inestimable treasure in earthen vessels,

   as he had previously said. (2 Corinthians 4:7.) Hence, however they may
   be surrounded with the infirmities of the flesh, the spiritual power of
   God, nevertheless, shines forth resplendently in them.

   4. For the weapons of our warfare. The warfare corresponds with the
   kind of weapons. He glories in being furnished with spiritual weapons.
   The warfare, accordingly, is spiritual. Hence it follows by way of
   contraries, [755] that it is not according to the flesh In comparing
   the ministry of the gospel to a warfare, he uses a most apt similitude.
   The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual warfare, for
   whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no truce from
   Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude. It
   becomes, however, ministers of the word and pastors to be
   standard-bearers, going before the others; and, certainly, there are
   none that Satan harasses more, that are more severely assaulted, or
   that sustain more numerous or more dreadful onsets. That man,
   therefore, is mistaken, who girds himself for the discharge of this
   office, and is not at the same time furnished with courage and bravery
   for contending; for he is not exercised otherwise than in fighting. For
   we must take this into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by
   which the fury of Satan is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he
   will arm himself for a contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced.

   But by what weapons is he to be repelled? It is only by spiritual
   weapons that he can be repelled. Whoever, therefore, is unarmed with
   the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he may boast that he is a
   minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove himself to be such. At
   the same time, if you would have a full enumeration of spiritual
   weapons, doctrine must be conjoined with zeal, and a good conscience
   with the efficacy of the Spirit, and with other necessary graces. Let
   now the Pope go, and assume to himself the apostolic dignity [756] What
   could be more ridiculous, if our judgment is to be formed in accordance
   with the rule here laid down by Paul!

   Mighty through God. Either according to God, or from God. I am of
   opinion, that there is here an implied antithesis, so that this
   strength is placed in contrast with the weakness which appears
   outwardly before the world, and thus, paying no regard to the judgments
   of men, he would seek from God approbation of his fortitude. [757] At
   the same time, the antithesis will hold good in another sense -- that
   the power of his arms depends upon God, not upon the world.

   In the demolishing of fortresses. He makes use of the term fortresses
   to denote contrivances, and every high thing that is exalted against
   God, [758] as to which we shall find him speaking afterwards. It is,
   however, with propriety and expressiveness that he so designates them;
   for his design is to boast, that there is nothing in the world so
   strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow. I am well
   aware how carnal men glory in their empty shows, and how disdainfully
   and recklessly they despise me, as though there were nothing in me but
   what is mean and base, while they, in the mean time, were standing on a
   lofty eminence. But their confidence is foolish, for that armor of the
   Lord, with which I fight, will prevail in opposition to all the
   bulwarks, in reliance upon which they believe themselves to be
   invincible. Now, as the world is accustomed to fortify itself in a
   twofold respect for waging war with Christ -- on the one hand, by
   cunning, by wicked artifices, by subtilty, and other secret
   machinations; and, on the other hand, by cruelty and oppression, he
   touches upon both these methods. For by contrivances he means, whatever
   pertains to carnal wisdom.

   The term high thing denotes any kind of glory and power in this world.
   There is no reason, therefore, why a servant of Christ should dread
   anything, however formidable, that may stand up in opposition to his
   doctrine. Let him, in spite of it, persevere, and he will scatter to
   the winds every machination of whatever sort. Nay more, the kingdom of
   Christ cannot be set up or established, otherwise than by throwing down
   everything in the world that is exalted. For nothing is more opposed to
   the spiritual wisdom of God than the wisdom of the flesh; nothing is
   more at variance with the grace of God than man's natural ability, and
   so as to other things. Hence the only foundation of Christ's kingdom is
   the abasement of men. And to this effect are those expressions in the
   Prophets:

   The moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall be confounded,
   when the Lord shall begin to reign in that day; (Isaiah 24:23.)

   Again,

   The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the high looks of mortals
   shall be abased, and the Lord alone shall be
   exalted in that day.(Isaiah 5:15, and Isaiah 2:17)

   Because, in order that God alone may shine forth, it is necessary that
   the glory of the world should vanish away.

   5. And bring into captivity I am of opinion, that, having previously
   spoken more particularly of the conflict of spiritual armor, along with
   the hinderances that rise up in opposition to the gospel of Christ, he
   now, on the other hand, speaks of the ordinary preparation, by which
   men must be brought into subjection to him. For so long as we rest in
   our own judgment, and are wise in our own estimation, we are far from
   having made any approach to the doctrine of Christ. Hence we must set
   out with this, that

   he who is wise must become a fool, (1 Corinthians 3:18,)

   that is, we must give up our own understanding, and renounce the wisdom
   of the flesh, and thus we must present our minds to Christ empty that
   he may fill them. Now the form of expression must be observed, when he
   says, that he brings every thought into captivity, for it is as though
   he had said, that the liberty of the human mind must be restrained and
   bridled, that it may not be wise, apart from the doctrine of Christ;
   and farther, that its audacity cannot be restrained by any other means,
   than by its being carried away, as it were, captive. Now it is by the
   guidance of the Spirit, that it is brought to allow itself to be placed
   under control, and remain in a voluntary captivity.

   6. And are in readiness to avenge. This he adds, lest insolent men
   should presumptuously lift themselves up in opposition to his ministry,
   as if they could do so with impunity. Hence he says, that power had
   been given him -- not merely for constraining voluntary disciples to
   subjection to Christ, but also for inflicting vengeance upon the
   rebellious, [759] and that his threats were not empty bugbears, [760]
   but had the execution quite in readiness -- to use the customary
   expression. Now this vengeance is founded on Christ's word --

   whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven.
   (Matthew 18:18.)

   For although God does not thunder forth immediately on the minister's
   pronouncing the sentence, yet the decision is ratified, [761] and will
   be accomplished in its own time. Let it, however, be always understood,
   that it is when the minister fights with spiritual armor. Some
   understand it as referring to bodily punishments, by means of which the
   Apostles inflicted vengeance upon contumacious and impious persons; as
   for example, Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and Paul struck
   Elymas the sorcerer blind. (Acts 5:1-10, and Acts 13:6-11.) But the
   other meaning suits better, for the Apostles did not make use of that
   power invariably or indiscriminately. Paul, however, speaks in general
   terms that he has vengeance ready at hand against all the disobedient.

   When your obedience shall be fulfilled How prudently he guards against
   alienating any by excessive severity! For as he had threatened to
   inflict punishment upon the rebellious, that he may not seem to provoke
   them, he declares that another duty had been enjoined upon him with
   regard to them -- simply that of making them obedient to Christ. And,
   unquestionably, this is the proper intention of the gospel, as he
   teaches both in the commencement and in the close of the Epistle to the
   Romans. (Romans 1:5, and Romans 16:26.) Hence all Christian teachers
   ought carefully to observe this order, that they should first endeavor
   with gentleness to bring their hearers to obedience, so as to invite
   them kindly before proceeding to inflict punishment upon rebellion.
   [762] Hence, too, Christ [763] has given the commandment as to loosing
   before that of binding. [764]

   offered to them, as Paul teaches. (2 Cor. 10:6.) But this is placed in
   last order, because it was proper that the true and real design of
   preaching the gospel should be first exhibited. That we are reconciled
   to God belongs to the nature of the gospel; that believers are adjudged
   to eternal life may be said to be accidentally connected with it. For
   this reason, Paul, in the passage which I lately quoted, when he
   threatens vengeance against unbelievers, immediately adds -- after that
   your obedience shall have been fulfilled; (2 Cor 10:6;) for he means,
   that it belongs peculiarly to the gospel to invite all to salvation,
   but that it is accidental to it that it brings destruction to any." --

   2 Corinthians 10:7-11

   7. Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust
   to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again,
   that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

   7. Quae secundum faciem sunt videtis: si quis sibi confidit, quia sit
   Christi, hoc reputet etiam ex se ipso rursum, quod sicuti ipse Christi,
   ita et nos Christi.

   8. For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the
   Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I
   should not be ashamed:

   8. Nam etsi abundantius glorier de potestate nostra, quam dedit nobis
   Dominus in aedificationem, et non in destructionem vestram, non
   pudefiam;

   9. That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

   9. Ne autem videar terrere vos per Epistolas.

   10. For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily
   presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

   10. (Siquidem Epistolae, inquiunt, graves sunt ac robustae; praesentia
   autem corporis infirma, et sermo contemptus.)

   11. Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters
   when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.

   11. Hoc cogitet qui talis est, quod quales sumus absentes, sermone per
   Epistolas, tales sumus etiam praesentes, opere.


   7. That are according to appearance. In the first place, the clause
   according to appearance, may be taken in two ways: either as meaning
   the reality itself, visible and manifest, or an outward mask, [765]
   that deceives us. The sentence, too, may be read either interrogatively
   or affirmatively: nay more, the verb blepete may be taken either in the
   imperative mood, or in the subjunctive. I am rather of opinion,
   however, that it is expressive of chiding, and that the Corinthians are
   reaproved, because they suffered their eyes to be dazzled with empty
   show. "You greatly esteem others who swell out with mighty airs of
   importance, while you look down upon me, because I have nothing of show
   and boasting." For Christ himself contrasts the judgment that is
   according to appearance with righteous judgment. (John 7:24, and John
   8:15.) Hence he reproves the Corinthians, because, contenting
   themselves with show, or appearance, they did not seriously consider,
   what kind of persons ought to be looked upon as the servants of Christ.

   If any one trusteth in himself -- an expression that is full of great
   confidence, for he takes it, as it were, for granted, that he is so
   certainly a minister of Christ, that this distinction cannot be taken
   from him. "Whoever," says he, "is desirous to be looked upon as a
   minister of Christ, must necessarily count me in along with himself."
   For what reason? "Let him," says he. "think for himself, for whatever
   things he may have in himself, that make him worthy of such an honor,
   the same will he find in me." By this he hinted to them, that whoever
   they might be that reviled him, ought not to be looked upon as the
   servants of Christ. It would not become all to speak thus confidently,
   for it might certainly happen -- nay, it happens every day, that they
   same claim is haughtily advanced by persons, that are of no reputation,
   and are nothing else than a dishonor to Christ. [766] Paul, however,
   affirmed nothing respecting himself but what he had openly given proof
   of by clear and sure evidences among the Corinthians. Now should any
   one, while destitute of all proof of the reality, recommend himself in
   a similar manner, what would he do but expose himself to ridicule? To
   trust in one's self is equivalent to assuming to one's self power and
   authority on the pretext that he serves Christ, while he is desirous to
   be held in estimation.

   8. For though I should boast more largely of my authority. It was a
   sign of modesty, that he put himself into the number of those, whom he
   greatly excelled. At the same time, he was not disposed to show such
   modesty, as not to retain his authority unimpaired. He accordingly
   adds, that he has said less than his authority entitled him to say; for
   he was not one of the ordinary class of ministers, but was even
   distinguished among the Apostles. Hence he says: "Though I should boast
   more, I should not be ashamed, for there will be good ground for it."
   He anticipates an objection, because he does not fail to speak of his
   own glory, while at the same time he refrains from making farther
   mention of it, that the Corinthians may understand, that, if he boasts,
   it is against his will, as in truth the false Apostles constrained him
   to it; otherwise he would not have done so.

   By the term power he means -- the authority of his Apostleship, which
   he had among the Corinthians for, through all the ministers of the word
   have the same office in common, there are nevertheless, degrees of
   honor. Now God had placed Paul on a higher eminence than others,
   inasmuch as he had made use of his endeavors for founding [767] that
   Church, and had in many ways put honor upon his Apostleship. Lest,
   however, malevolent persons should stir up odium against him, on the
   ground of his making use of the term power, he adds the purpose for
   which it was given him -- the salvation of the Corinthians. Hence it
   follows, that it ought not to be irksome to them, or grievous, for who
   would not bear patiently, nay more, who would not love what he knows to
   be of advantage to him? In the mean time, there is an implied contrast
   between his power, and that in which the false apostles gloried --
   which was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no advantage
   from it, and experienced no edification. There can, however, be no
   doubt, that all the ministers of the word are also, furnished with
   power; for of what sort were a preaching of the word, that was without
   power? Hence it is said to all --

   He that heareth you, heareth me;
   he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me. (Luke 10:16.)

   As however, many, on false grounds, claim for themselves what they have
   not, we must carefully observe, how far Paul extends his power -- so as
   to be to the edification of believers. Those, then, who exercise power
   in the way of destroying the Church, prove themselves to be tyrants,
   and robbers -- not pastors. In the second place, we must observe, that
   he declares, that it was given to him by God. He, therefore, that is
   desirous to have any thing in his power to do, must have God as the
   Author of his power. Others, it is true, will boast of this also, as
   the Pope with full mouth thunders forth, that he is Christ's vicar. But
   what evidence does he give of this? [768] For Christ has not conferred
   power of this kind upon dumb persons, but upon the Apostles, and his
   other ministers, that the doctrine of his Gospel might not be without
   defense. Hence the whole power of ministers is included in the word --
   but in such a way, nevertheless, that Christ may always remain Lord and
   Master. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that in lawful authority these
   two things are required -- that it be given by God, and that it be
   exercised for the welfare of the Church. It is well known, who they
   are, on whom God has conferred this power, and in what way he has
   limited the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper manner,
   who faithfully obey his commandment.

   Here, however, a question may be proposed. "God says to Jeremiah,

   Behold, I set thee over the nations, and kingdoms,
   to plant, and to pluck up, to build and to destroy.
   (Jeremiah 1:10.)

   We have, also, found it stated a little before, (2 Corinthians 10:5)
   that the Apostles were set apart on the same footing -- that they might
   destroy every thing that exalted itself against Christ. Nay more, the
   teachers of the gospel cannot build up in any other way, than by
   destroying the old man. Besides, they preach the gospel to the
   condemnation and destruction of the wicked." I answer that, what Paul
   says here, has nothing to do with the wicked, for he addresses the
   Corinthians, to whom he wished his Apostleship to be beneficial. With
   regard to them, I say, he could do nothing but with a view to
   edification. We have already observed, also, that this was expressly
   stated, that the Corinthians might know, that the authority of this
   holy man was not assailed by any one but Satan, the enemy of their
   salvation, while the design of that authority was their edification.

   At the same time, it is in other respects true in a general way, that
   the doctrine of the gospel has in its own nature a tendency to
   edification -- not to destruction. For as to its destroying, that comes
   from something apart from itself -- from the fault of mankind, while
   they stumble at the stone that was appointed form as a foundation (1
   Peter 2:8.) As to the fact, that we are renewed after the image of God
   by the destruction of the old man -- that is not at all at variance
   with Paul's words, for in that case destruction is taken in a good
   sense, but here in a bad sense, as meaning the ruin of what is God's,
   or as meaning the destruction of the soul -- as if he had said, that
   his power was not injurious to them, for instead of this the advantage
   of it for their salvation was manifested.

   9 That I may not seem to terrify. Again he touches on the calumny which
   he had formerly refuted, (2 Corinthians 10:2,) that he was bold in his
   writings, while in their presence his courage failed him. On this
   pretext they disparaged his writings. [769] "What!" Said they, "will he
   terrify us by letters when at a distance, while, if present with us, he
   would scarcely venture to mutter a word!" Lest, therefore, his letters
   should have less weight, he answers, that no objection is advanced
   against him, that should either destroy or weaken his credit, and that
   of his doctrine, for deeds were not to be less valued than words. He
   was not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words
   when absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be
   looked upon as contemptible. By deed, here, he means, in my opinion,
   the efficacy and success of his preaching, as well as the excellences
   that were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of life. Speech,
   on the other hand, denotes -- not the very substance of doctrine, but
   simply the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have
   contended for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however,
   proceeded from this -- that he was deficient in that ornament and
   splendor of eloquence, which secures favor. [770]

   2 Corinthians 10:12-18

   12. For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves
   with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by
   themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.

   12. Non enim audemus nos quibusdam inserere aut comparare, qui se ipsos
   commendant: verum ipsi in se ipsis se metientes, et se ipsos
   comparantes sibi, non sapiunt.

   13. But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according
   to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure
   to reach even unto you.

   13. Nos autem non sine modo gloriabimur, sed pro mensura regulae, quam
   nobis distribuit Deus: mensura, inquam, perveniendi etiam usque ad vos.

   14. For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
   reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
   preaching the gospel of Christ:

   14. Non enim quasi ad vos non perveniremus, supra modum extendimus nos
   ipsos: siquidem usque ad vos pertigimus in Evangelio Christi.

   15. Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's
   labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall
   be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,

   15. Non gloriantes sine modo in alienis laboribus, [771] spem autem
   habentes, crescente fide vestra in vobis, nos magnificatum iri secundum
   nostram regulam in exuberantiam.

   16. To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in
   another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

   16. Ut etiam ultra vos evangelizem, non in aliena regula, ut de iis,
   quae parata sunt, glorier.

   17. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

   17. Caeterum qui gloriatur in Domino glorietur.

   18. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
   commendeth.

   18. Non enim qui se ipsum commendat, ille probatus est: sed quem
   Dominus commendat.


   12. For we dare not. He says this by way of irony, for afterwards he
   does not merely compare himself boldly with them, but, deriding their
   vanity, he leaves them far behind him. Now by this irony he gives a
   stroke, not merely to those foolish boasters, [772] but also to the
   Corinthians, who encouraged them in their folly by their misdirected
   approbation. "I am satisfied," says he, "with my moderate way; for I
   would not dare to put myself on a footing with your Apostles, who are
   the heralds of their own excellence." In the mean time, when he
   intimates that their glory consists of mere speaking and boasting, he
   shows, how silly and worthless they are, while he claims for himself
   deeds instead of words, that is, true and solid ground of glorying. He
   may seem, however, to err in the very thing for which he reproves
   others, for he immediately afterwards commends himself. I answer, that
   his design must be taken into view, for those do not aim at their own
   commendation, who, entirely free from ambition, have no desire but to
   serve the Lord usefully. [773] As to this passage, however, there is no
   need of any other explanation than what may be gathered from the words
   themselves, for those are said to commend themselves, who, while in
   poverty and starvation as to true praise, exalt themselves in
   vain-glorious boasting, and falsely give out, that they are what they
   are not. This, also, appears from what follows.

   But they measure themselves by themselves Here he points out, as with
   his finger their folly. The man that has but one eye sees well enough
   among the blind: the man that is dull of hearing hears distinctly
   enough among the totally deaf. Such were those that were satisfied with
   themselves, and showed themselves off among others, simply because they
   did not look to any that were superior to themselves, for if they had
   compared themselves with Paul, or any one like him, they would have
   felt constrained to lay aside immediately that foolish impression which
   they entertained, and would have exchanged boasting for shame.

   For an explanation of this passage we need look no farther than to the
   monks; for as they are almost all of them the most ignorant asses, and
   at the same time are looked upon as learned persons, on account of
   their long robe and hood, if any one has merely a slight smattering of
   elegant literature, he proudly spreads out his feathers like a peacock
   -- a marvelous fame goes abroad respecting him -- among his companions
   he is adored [774] Were, however, the mask of the hood laid aside,
   [775] and a thorough examination entered upon, their vanity would at
   once be discovered. Why so? The old proverb holds good: "Ignorance is
   pert." [776] But the excessively insolent arrogance of the monks [777]
   proceeds chiefly from this -- that they measure themselves by
   themselves; for, as in their cloisters there is nothing but barbarism,
   [778] it is not to be wondered, if the man that has but one eye is a
   king among the blind. Such were Paul's rivals, for inwardly they
   flattered themselves, not considering what virtues entitled a person to
   true praise, and how far short they came of the excellence of Paul, and
   those like him. And, certainly, this single consideration might justly
   have covered them with shame, but it is the just punishment of the
   ambitious, that by their silliness they expose themselves to ridicule,
   (than which there is nothing that they are more desirous to avoid,) and
   in place of glory, which they are immoderately desirous of, [779] they
   incur disgrace.

   13. But we will not boast beyond our measure He now contrasts his own
   moderation with the folly of the false Apostles, [780] and, at the same
   time, he shows what is the true measure of glorying -- when we keep
   within the limits that have been marked out for us by the Lord. "Has
   the Lord given me such a thing? I shall be satisfied with this measure.
   I shall not either desire or claim to myself any thing more." This he
   calls the measure of his rule. [781] For every one's rule, according to
   which he ought to regulate himself is this -- God's gift and calling.
   At the same time, it is not lawful for us to glow in God's gift and
   calling on our own account, but merely in so far as it is expedient for
   the glory of him, who is so liberal to us with this view -- that we may
   acknowledge ourselves indebted to him for everything. [782]

   A measure to reach. By this clause he intimates, that he stands in no
   need of commendations expressed in words among the Corinthians, who
   were a portion of his glow, as he says elsewhere, (Philippians 4:1,) ye
   are my crown. He carries out, however, the form of expression, which he
   had previously entered upon. "I have," says he, "a most ample field for
   glorying, so as not to go beyond my own limits, and you are one
   department of that field." He modestly reproves, however, their
   ingratitude, [783] in overlooking, in a manner, his apostleship, which
   ought to have been especially in estimation among them, on the ground
   of God's commendation of it. In each clause, too, we must understand as
   implied, a contrast between him and the false Apostles, who had no such
   approbation to show.

   14. For we do not overstretch. He alludes to persons who either
   forcibly stretch out their arms, or raise themselves up on their feet,
   when wishing to catch hold of what is not at their hand, [784] for of
   this nature is a greedy thirst for glory, nay more, it is often more
   disgusting. For ambitious persons do not merely stretch out their arms
   and lift up their feet, but are even carried headlong with the view of
   obtaining some pretext for glorying. [785] He tacitly intimates that
   his rivals were of this stamp. He afterwards declares on what ground he
   had come to the Corinthians -- because he had founded their church by
   his ministry. Hence he says, in the gospel of Christ; for he had not
   come to them empty, [786] but had been the first to bring the gospel to
   them. The preposition in is taken by some in another way; for they
   render it, by the gospel, and this meaning does not suit ill. At the
   same time, Paul seems to set off to advantage his coming to the
   Corinthians, on the ground of his having been furnished with so
   precious a gift.

   15. In the labors of others. He now reproves more freely the false
   Apostles, who, while they had put forth their hand in the reaping of
   another man's harvest, had the audacity at the same time to revile
   those, who had prepared a place for them at the expense of sweat and
   toil. Paul had built up the Church of the Corinthians -- not without
   the greatest struggle, and innumerable difficulties. Those persons
   afterwards come forward, and find the road made and the gate open. That
   they may appear persons of consequence, they impudently claim for
   themselves what did not of right belong to them, and disparage Paul's
   labors.

   But having hope. He again indirectly reproves the Corinthians, because
   they had stood in the way of his making greater progress in advancing
   the gospel. For when he says that he hopes that, when their faith is
   increased the boundaries of his glowing will be enlarged, he intimates,
   that the weakness of faith under which they labored was the reason, why
   his career had been somewhat retarded. "I ought now to have been
   employed in gaining over new Churches, and that too with your
   assistance, if you had made as much proficiency as you ought to have
   done; but now you retard me by your infirmity. I hope, however, that
   the Lord will grant, that greater progress will be made by you in
   future, and that in this way the glory of my ministry will be increased
   according to the rule of the divine calling." [787] To glory in things
   that have been prepared is equivalent to glorying in the labors of
   others; for, while Paul had fought the battle, they enjoyed the
   triumph. [788]

   17. But he that glorieth This statement is made by way of correction,
   as his glorying might be looked upon as having the appearance of empty
   boasting. Hence he cites himself and others before the judgment-seat of
   God, saying, that those glory on good grounds, who are approved by God.
   To glory in the Lord, however, is used here in a different sense from
   what it bears in the first chapter of the former Epistle, (1
   Corinthians 1:31,) and in Jeremiah 9:24. For in those passages it means
   -- to recognize God as the author of all blessings, in such a way that
   every blessing is ascribed to his grace, while men do not extol
   themselves, but glorify him alone. Here, however, it means -- to place
   our glory at the disposal of God alone, [789] and reckon every thing
   else as of no value. For while some are dependent on the estimation of
   men, and weigh themselves in the false balance of public opinion, and
   others are deceived by their own arrogance, Paul exhorts us to be
   emulous of this glow -- that we may please the Lord, by whose judgment
   we all stand or fall.

   Even heathens say, that true glory consists in an upright conscience.
   [790] Now that is so much, but it is not all; for, as almost all are
   blind through excessive self-love, we cannot safely place confidence in
   the estimate that we form of ourselves. For we must keep in mind what
   he says elsewhere, (1 Corinthians 4: 4,) that he is not conscious to
   himself of anything wrong, and yet is not thereby justified. What then?
   Let us know, that to God alone must be reserved the right of passing
   judgment upon us; for we are not competent judges in our own cause.
   This meaning is confirmed by what follows --

   For not he that commendeth himself is approved "For it is easy to
   impose upon men by a false impression, and this is matter of every day
   occurrence. Let us, therefore, leaving off all other things, aim
   exclusively at this -- that we may be approved by God, and may be
   satisfied to have his approbation alone, as it justly ought to be
   regarded by us as of more value than all the applauses of the whole
   world. There was one that said, that to have Plato's favorable judgment
   was to him worth a thousand. [791] The question here is not as to the
   judgment of mankind, in respect of the superiority of one to another,
   but as to the sentence of God himself, who has it in his power to
   overturn all the decisions that men have pronounced.

   following verses, if, with Hammond, we consider the terms used in them
   as agonistical. In this view of them, the measure of the rule' (to
   metron tou kanonos) alludes to the path marked out, and bounded by a
   white line, for racers in the Isthmian games, celebrated among the
   Corinthians; and so the Apostle represents his work in preaching the
   gospel as his spiritual race, and the province to which he was
   appointed as the compass or stage of ground, which God had distributed
   or measured out (emerisen auto) for him to run in. Accordingly, to
   boast without his measure,' (2 Corinthians 10:13, eis ta ametra) and to
   stretch himself beyond his measure,' (huperekteinesthai) refer to one
   that ran beyond or out of his line. We are come as far as to you' (2
   Corinthians 10:14, achri humon ephthasamen) alludes to him that came
   foremost to the goal; and in another man's line' (2 Corinthians 10:16,
   en allotrio kanoni) signifies -- 'in the province that was marked out
   for somebody else,' in allusion to the line by which the race was
   bounded, each of the racers having the path which he ought to run
   chalked out to him, and if one stepped over into the other's path he
   extended himself over his line." -- Paxton's Illustrations ("Manners
   and Customs," volume 2.) -- Ed.

   [782] "Afin que nons luy facions hommage de tout ce que nons avons,

   as to every thing that we have, confessing that we hold it from him."

   ingratitude;" -- "But by speaking thus he reproves, (modestly,

   CHAPTER 11
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 11:1-6

   1. Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed
   bear with me.

   1. Utinam tolerassetis me paulisper in insipientia mea: imo etiam
   sufferte me. [792]

   2. For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused
   you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to
   Christ.

   2. Nam zelotypus sum erga vos Dei zelo: adiunxi enim vos uni viro, ad
   exhibendam virginem castam Christo.

   3. But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
   his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity
   that is in Christ.

   3. Sed metuo, ne qua fiat, ut quemadmodum serpens Evam decepit versutia
   sua: ita corrumpantur sensus vestri a simplicitate, quae est in
   Christo.

   4. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
   preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received,
   or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with
   him

   4. Nam si is qui venit, (vel, si quis veniens,) alium Iesum praedicat,
   quem non praedicavimus; aut si alium Spiritum accipitis, quem non
   accepitis: aut Evangelium aliud, quod non accepistis, recte
   sustinuissetis.

   5. For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

   5. Arbitror enim me nihilo inferiorem fuisse eximiis Apostolis.

   6. But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
   been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

   6. Caeterum licet imperitus sim sermone, non tamen scientia: verum
   ubique manifesti fuimus in omnibus erga vos.


   1. Would that ye did bear with me. As he saw that the ears of the
   Corinthians were still in part pre-engaged, [793] he has recourse to
   another contrivance, for he turns to express a wish, as persons do when
   they do not venture openly to entreat. [794] Immediately afterwards,
   however, as if gathering confidence, he nevertheless entreats the
   Corinthians to bear with his folly. He gives the name of folly to that
   splendid proclamation of his praises, which afterwards follows. Not as
   if he were a fool in glorying; for he was constrained to it by
   necessity, and besides, he restrained himself in such a manner, that no
   one could justly regard him as going beyond bounds; but as it is an
   unseemly thing to herald one's own praises, and a thing that is foreign
   to the inclinations of a modest man, he speaks by way of concession.

   What I have rendered in the imperative -- bear with me, Chrysostom
   interprets as an affirmation, and certainly the Greek word is
   ambiguous, and either sense suits sufficiently well. As, however, the
   reasons that the Apostle subjoins are designed to induce the
   Corinthians to bear with him, and as we will find him afterwards
   expostulating with them again on the ground of their not conceding
   anything to him, I have followed the Old Interpreter. [795] By saying,
   Would that, etc., he had seemed to be distrustful; now, as if
   correcting that hesitation, he openly and freely commands.

   2. For I am jealous Mark why it is that he acts the fool, for jealousy
   hurries a man as it were headlong. "Do not demand that I should show
   the equable temper [796] of a man that is at ease, and not excited by
   any emotion, for that vehemence of vehemence of jealousy, with which I
   am inflamed towards you, does not suffer me to be at ease." As,
   however, there are two kinds of jealousy -- the one springs from self
   love, and of a wicked and perverse nature, while the other is cherished
   by us on God's account, [797] he intimates of what sort his zeal is.
   For many are zealous -- for themselves, not for God. That on the other
   hand, is the only pious and right zeal, that has an eye to God, that he
   may not be defrauded of the honors that of right belong to him.

   For I have united you to one man. That his zeal was of such a nature,
   he proves from the design of his preaching, for its tendency was to
   join them to Christ in marriage, and retain them in connection with
   him. [798] Here, however, he gives us in his own person a lively
   picture of a good minister; for One alone is the Bridegroom of the
   Church -- the Son of God. All ministers are the friends of the
   Bridegroom, as the Baptist declares respecting himself. (John 3:29.)
   Hence all ought to be concerned, that the fidelity of this sacred
   marriage remain unimpaired and inviolable. This they cannot do, unless
   they are actuated by the dispositions of the Bridegroom, so that every
   one of them may be as much concerned for the purity of the Church, as a
   husband is for the chastity of his wife. Away then with coldness and
   indolence in this matter, for one that is cold [799] will never be
   qualified for this office. Let them, however, in the mean time, take
   care, not to pursue their own interest rather than that of Christ, that
   they may not intrude themselves into his place, lest while they give
   themselves out as his paranymphs, [800] they turn out to be in reality
   adulterers, by alluring the bride to love themselves.

   To present you as a chaste virgin. We are married to Christ, on no
   other condition than that we bring virginity as our dowry, and preserve
   it entire, so as to be free from all corruption. Hence it is the duty
   of ministers of the gospel to purify our souls, that they may be chaste
   virgins to Christ; otherwise they accomplish nothing. Now we may
   understand it as meaning, that they individually present themselves as
   chaste virgins to Christ, or that the minister presents the whole of
   the people, and brings them forward into Christ's presence. I approve
   rather of the second interpretation. Hence I have given a different
   rendering from Erasmus. [801]

   3. But I fear He begins to explain, what is the nature of that
   virginity of which he has made mention -- our cleaving to Christ alone,
   sincerely, with our whole heart. God, indeed, everywhere requires from
   us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit, and he warns us
   that he is a jealous God, (Exodus 20:5,) to avenge with the utmost
   severity the wrong done to him, in the event of any one's drawing back
   from him. This connection, however, is accomplished in Christ, as Paul
   teaches in Ephesians, (Ephesians 5:25, 27.) He points out, however, at
   present the means of it -- when we remain in the pure simplicity of the
   gospel, for, as in contracting marriages among men, there are written
   contracts [802] drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and
   the Son of God is confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written
   contract. [803] Let us maintain the fidelity, love, and obedience, that
   have been there promised by us; he will be faithful to us on his part.

   Now Paul says that he is concerned, that the minds of the Corinthians
   may not be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ Paul, it is
   true, says in Greek eis Christon, which Erasmus renders towards Christ,
   [804] but the Old Interpreter has come nearer, in my opinion, to Paul's
   intention, [805] because by the simplicity that is in Christ is meant,
   that which keeps us in the unadulterated and pure doctrine of the
   gospel, and admits of no foreign admixtures [806] By this he intimates
   that men's minds are adulterated, [807] whenever they turn aside, even
   in the least degree, to the one side or to the other, from the pure
   doctrine of Christ. Nor is it without good reason, for who would not
   condemn a matron as guilty of unchastity, so soon as she lends an ear
   to a seducer? So in like manner we, when we admit wicked and false
   teachers, who are Satan's vile agents, show but too clearly, that we do
   not maintain conjugal fidelity towards Christ. We must also take notice
   of the term simplicity, for Paul's fear was not, lest the Corinthians
   should all at once openly draw back altogether from Christ, but lest,
   by turning aside, by little and little, from the simplicity which they
   had learned, so as to go after profane and foreign contrivances, they
   should at length become adulterated.

   He brings forward a comparison as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
   subtilty For if false teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any
   power of eloquence for persuading, if they plausibly insinuate
   themselves into the minds of their hearers, and instill their poison by
   fawning artifices, it was in a similar way that Satan also beguiled
   Eve, as he did not openly declare himself to be an enemy, but crept in
   privily under a specious pretext.

   4. For if he that cometh. He now reproves the Corinthians for the
   excessive readiness, which they showed to receive the false apostles.
   For while they were towards Paul himself excessively morose and
   irritable, [808] so that on any, even the least occasion, they were
   offended if he gave them even the slightest reproof, there was, on the
   other hand, nothing that they did not bear with, on the part of the
   false Apostles. They willingly endured their pride, haughtiness, and
   unreasonableness. An absurd reverence of this nature he condemns,
   because in the mean time they showed no discrimination or judgment.
   "How is it that they take [809] so much liberty with you, and you
   submit patiently to their control? Had they brought you another Christ,
   or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from what you received
   through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for them,
   for they would be deserving of such honor. But as they have conferred
   upon you nothing, that I had not given you previously, what sort of
   gratitude do you show in all but adoring those, to whom you are
   indebted for nothing, while you despise me, through whom God has
   bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished benefits?" Such is the
   reverence that is shown even at this day by Papists towards their
   pretended Bishops. For while they are oppressed by their excessively
   harsh tyranny, [810] they submit to it without difficulty; but, at the
   same time, do not hesitate to treat Christ himself with contempt. [811]

   The expressions -- another Christ, and another gospel, are made use of
   here in a different sense from what they bear in Galatians 1:8. For
   another is used there in opposition to what is true and genuine, and
   hence it means false and counterfeit. Here, on the other hand, he means
   to say -- "If the gospel had come to you through their ministry, and
   not through mine."

   5. For I reckon that I am. He now convicts them of ingratitude, by
   removing the only thing that could serve as an excuse for them, for he
   shows that he is on a level, even with the chief of the Apostles. The
   Corinthians, therefore, were ungrateful [812] in not esteeming him more
   highly, after having found him, by experience, to be such; while, on
   the other hand, the authority that was justly due to him, they
   transferred to persons of no value. For the sake of modesty, however,
   he says that he reckons so, while the thing was known and manifest to
   all. His meaning, however, is, that God had honored his Apostleship
   with no less distinguished marks of favor, than that of John or Peter.
   Now the man that despises the gifts of God, which he himself
   recognizes, cannot clear himself from the charge of being spiteful and
   ungrateful. Hence, wherever you see the gifts of God, you must there
   reverence God himself: [813] I mean, that every one is worthy of honor,
   in so far as he is distinguished by graces received from God, and
   especially if any advantage has redounded to thee from them.

   6. But though I am rude There was one thing [814] in which he might
   appear, at first view, to be inferior -- that he was devoid of
   eloquence. This judgment, [815] therefore, he anticipates and corrects,
   while he acknowledges himself, indeed, to be rude and unpolished in
   speech, while at the same time he maintains that he has knowledge By
   speech here he means, elegance of expression; and by knowledge he
   means, the very substance of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a
   body, so also in doctrine, there is the thing itself that is taught,
   and the ornament of expression with which it is clothed. Paul,
   therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and
   what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so
   as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent
   manner of expression.

   It is asked, however, whether elegance of speech [816] is not also
   necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared for
   teaching? Knowledge might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a
   teacher be dumb? I answer, that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be
   rude in speech, it is not as though he were a mere infant, but as
   meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid eloquence as
   others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for himself
   what was the principal thing -- the reality itself, [817] while he
   leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should
   inquire, why it is that the Lord, who made men's tongues, (Exodus
   4:11,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that
   nothing might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a
   sufficiency for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel,
   what majesty there is in his writings, what elevation appears in them,
   what a weight of meaning is couched under them, what power is
   discovered in them. In fine, they are thunderbolts, not mere words.
   Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more clearly in a naked
   rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of elegance
   and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have treated more largely in
   the former Epistle. [818] In short, he admits, as far as words are
   concerned, what his adversaries allege by way of objection, while he
   denies in reality what they hold forth. Let us also learn, from his
   example, to prefer deeds to words, and, to use a barbarous but common
   proverb -- "Teneant alii quid nominis, nos autem quid rei;" -- "Let
   others know something of the name, but let us know something of the
   reality." [819] If eloquence is superadded, let it be regarded by us as
   something over and above; and farther, let it not be made use of for
   disguising doctrine, or adulterating it, but for unfolding it in its
   genuine simplicity.

   But everywhere. As there was something magnificent in placing himself
   on a level with the chief Apostles, that this may not be ascribed to
   arrogance, he makes the Corinthians judges, provided they judge from
   what they have themselves experienced; for they had known sufficiently
   well, from many proofs, that he did not boast needlessly, or without
   good reason. He means, therefore, that he needs not make use of words,
   inasmuch as reality and experience afford clear evidence of every thing
   that he was about to say [820]

   2 Corinthians 11:7-12

   7. Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
   exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

   7. Num illud peccavi, quod me ipsum humiliaverim, [821] ut vos
   exaltaremini: quod gratuito Evangelium Dei praedicaverim vobis?

   8. I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

   8. Caeteras Ecclesias depraedatus sum accepto ab illis stipendio, quo
   vobis inservirem.

   9. And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no
   man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from
   Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being
   burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself

   9. Et quum apud vos essem et egerem, non onerosus fui cuiquam; [822]
   nam quod mihi deerat, suppleverunt fratres, qui venerant ex Macedonia;
   et in omnibus sic me servavi, ne cui essem onerosus, atque ita servabo.

   10. As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
   boasting in the regions of Achaia.

   7. Have I committed an offense? His humility was cast up to him by way
   of reproach, while it was an excellence that was deserving of no
   ordinary commendation. Humility here means -- voluntary abasement; for
   in conducting himself modestly, as if he had nothing in him that was
   particularly excellent, so that many looked upon him as one of the
   common people, he had done that for the advantage of the Corinthians.
   For the man was inflamed with so great a desire, [823] and so great an
   anxiety for their salvation, that he made a regard to himself a
   secondary consideration. Hence he says, that he had of his own accord
   made a surrender of his own greatness, that they might become great
   through his abasement. For his design was, that he might promote their
   salvation. He now indirectly charges them with ingratitude, in imputing
   to him as a fault so pious a disposition -- not indeed for the purpose
   of reproaching him, but with the view of restoring them so much the
   better to a sound mind. And certainly, he wounded them more severely by
   speaking ironically, than if he had spoken in a simple way, and without
   a figure. He might have said, "What is this? Am I despised by you,
   because I have lowered myself for your advantage?" The questioning,
   however, which he makes use of, was more forcible for putting them to
   shame.

   Because I preached freely This is a part of his abasement. For he had
   given up his own right, as though his condition had been inferior to
   that of others; but such was the unreasonableness of some of them, that
   they esteemed him the less on that account, as if he had been
   undeserving of remuneration. The reason, why he had given his services
   to the Corinthians gratuitously, is immediately subjoined -- for he did
   not act in this manner everywhere, but, as we have seen in the former
   Epistle, [824] there was a danger of his furnishing the false Apostles
   with a handle against him.

   8. I robbed other churches He has intentionally, in my opinion, made
   use of an offensive term, that he might the more forcibly express the
   unreasonableness of the matter -- in respect of his being despised by
   the Corinthians. "I have," says he, "procured pay for myself from the
   spoils of others, that I might serve you. While I have thus spared you,
   how unreasonable it is to make me so poor a return!" It is, however, a
   metaphor, that is taken from what is customary among soldiers; for as
   conquerors take spoils from the nations that they have conquered, so
   every thing that Paul took from the Churches that he had gained to
   Christ was, in a manner, the spoils of his victories, though, at the
   same time, he never would have taken it from persons against their
   will, but what they contributed gratuitously was, in a manner, due by
   right of spiritual warfare. [825]

   Observe, however, that he says that he had been in want, for he would
   never have been a burden to them, had he not been constrained by
   necessity. He, nevertheless, in the mean time, labored with his hands,
   as we have seen before, (1 Corinthians 4:12,) but, as the labor of his
   hands was not sufficient for sustaining life, something additional was
   contributed by the Macedonians. Accordingly he does not say, that his
   living had been furnished to him by the Macedonians, [826] but merely
   that they had supplied what was wanting. We have spoken elsewhere of
   the Apostle's holy prudence and diligence in providing against dangers.
   Here we must take notice of the pious zeal of the Macedonians, who did
   not hesitate to contribute of their substance for his pay, that the
   gospel might be proclaimed to others, and those, too, that were
   wealthier than themselves. Ah! how few Macedonians are there in the
   present day, and on the other hand how many Corinthians you may find
   everywhere!

   10. The truth of Christ is in me. Lest any one should suspect, that
   Paul's words were designed to induce the Corinthians to be more liberal
   to him in future, and endeavor to make amends for their error in the
   past, he affirms with an oath, that he would take nothing from them, or
   from others in Achaia, though it were offered to him. For this manner
   of expression -- the truth of Christ is in me, is in the form of oath.
   Let me not be thought to have the truth of Christ in me if I do not
   retain this glorying among the inhabitants of Achaia. Now Corinth was
   in Achaia. [827]

   11. Is it because I love you not? Those that we love, we treat with
   greater familiarity. Lest the Corinthians, therefore, should take it
   amiss, that he refused their liberality, while he allowed himself to be
   assisted by the Macedonians, and even declared with an oath that he
   would do so still, he anticipates that suspicion also. And by the
   figure termed anthypophora, [828] he asks, as it were in their name,
   whether this is a token of a malevolent mind? He does not return a
   direct answer to the question, but the indirect answer that he returns
   has much more weight, inasmuch as he calls God to be a witness of his
   good disposition towards them. You see here, that in the course of
   three verses [829] there are two oaths, but they are lawful and holy,
   because they have a good design in view, and a legitimate reason is
   involved. Hence to condemn indiscriminately all oaths is to act the
   part of fanatics, who make no distinction between white and black.
   [830]

   12. But what I do. He again explains the reason of his intention. [831]
   The false Apostles, with the view of alluring to themselves ignorant
   persons, took no pay. Their serving gratuitously was a show of uncommon
   zeal. [832] If Paul had availed himself of his right, he would have
   given them occasion to raise their crest, as if they had been greatly
   superior to him. Paul, accordingly, that he might give them no occasion
   of doing injury, did himself, also, preach the Gospel, free of charge,
   and this is what he adds -- that he is desirous to cut off occasion
   from those that desire occasion For the false Apostles were desirous to
   insinuate themselves by this artifice, and to detract, in proportion to
   this, from Paul's credit, if they were superior to him in any respect.
   He says, that he will not give them this advantage. "They will be
   found," says he, "on a level with us in that glorying which they would
   wish to have for themselves exclusively." This, however, is a useful
   admonition in connection with cutting off occasion from the wicked, as
   often as they desire one. For this is the only way to overcome them --
   not in the way of furnishing them with arms through our imprudence.

   2 Corinthians 11:13-15

   13. For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
   themselves into the apostles of Christ.

   13. Saiquidem istiusmodi pseudoapostoli; operarii dolosi sunt, qui
   transformant se in Apostolos Christi.

   14. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
   light.

   14. Neque id mirum; quondoquidem ipse Satanas transfiguratur in Angelum
   lucis.

   15. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed
   as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to
   their works.

   15. Non magnum igitur, si et ministri illius transformant se, perinde
   acsi essent ministri iustitiae: quorum finis erit secundum opera
   ipsorum.


   13. For such are false Apostles While he has already taken away from
   them what they chiefly desired, yet, not contented with having put
   himself on a level with them with respect to that in which they were
   desirous to excel, he leaves them nothing for which they deserve any
   commendation. It was apparently a laudable thing to despise money, but
   he says, that they make use of a pretense for the purpose of deceiving,
   exactly as if a harlot were to borrow the apparel of a decent matron.
   For it was necessary to pull off the mask, which obscured the glory of
   God.

   They are deceitful workers, says he, that is -- they do not discover
   their wickedness at first view, but artfully insinuate themselves under
   some fair pretext. [834] Hence they require to be carefully and
   thoroughly sifted, lest we should receive persons as servants of
   Christ, as soon as any appearance of excellence is discovered. Nor does
   Paul in malice and envy put an unfavorable construction upon what might
   be looked upon as an excellence, but, constrained by their dishonesty,
   he unfolds to view the evil that lay hid, because there was a dangerous
   profanation of virtue in pretending to burn with greater zeal than all
   the servants of Christ.

   14. And no marvel It is an argument from the greater to the less. "If
   Satan, who is the basest of all beings, nay, the head and chief of all
   wicked persons, transforms himself, what will his ministers do?" We
   have experience of both every day, for when Satan tempts us to evil, he
   does not profess to be what he really is. For he would lose his object,
   if we were made aware of his being a mortal enemy, and opposer of our
   salvation. Hence he always makes use of some cloak for the purpose of
   insnaring us, and does not immediately show his horns, (as the common
   expression is,) but rather makes it his endeavor to appear as an angel
   Even when he tempts us to gross crimes, he makes use, nevertheless, of
   some pretext that he may draw us, when we are off our guard, into his
   nets. What then, if he attacks us under the appearance of good, nay,
   under the very title of God? His life-guards imitate, as I have said,
   the same artifice. These are golden preambles -- "Vicar of Christ" --
   "Successor of Peter" -- "Servant of God's servants," but let the masks
   be pulled off, and who and what will the Pope be discovered to be?
   Scarcely will Satan himself, his master, surpass so accomplished a
   scholar in any kind of abomination. It is a well known saying as to
   Babylon, that she gives poison to drink in a golden cup. (Jeremiah
   51:7.) Hence we must be on our guard against masks.

   Should any one now ask, "Shall we then regard all with suspicion?" I
   answer, that the Apostle did not by any means intend this; for there
   are marks of discrimination, which it were the part of stupidity, not
   of prudence, to overlook. He was simply desirous to arouse our
   attention, that we may not straightway judge of the lion from the skin
   [835] For if we are not hasty in forming a judgment, the Lord will
   order it so that the ears of the animal will be discovered ere long.
   Farther, he was desirous in like manner to admonish us, in forming an
   estimate of Christ's servants, not to regard masks, but to seek after
   what is of more importance. Ministers of righteousness is a Hebraism
   for faithful and upright persons. [836]

   15. Whose end shall be. He adds this for the consolation of the pious.
   For it is the statement of a courageous man, who despises the foolish
   judgments of men, and patiently waits for the day of the Lord. In the
   mean time, he shows a singular boldness of conscience, which does not
   dread the judgment of God.

   2 Corinthians 11:16-21

   16. I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a
   fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

   16. Iterum dico, ne quis me putet insipientem esse: alioqui iam etiam
   ut insipientem accipite me, ut paululum quiddam et ego glorier.

   17. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were
   foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

   17. Quod dico, non dico secundum Dominum, sed velut per insipientiam:
   in hac audacia gloriationis.

   18. Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

   18. Quandoquidem multi gloriantur secundum carnem, et ego gloriabor.

   19. For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

   19. Libenter enim suffertis insipientes: quum sitis ipsi sapientes.

   20. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
   you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you
   on the face.

   20. Suffertis enim, si quis vos in servitutem adigit, si quis exedit,
   si quis accipit, si quis attollit sese, si quis vos in faciem caedit.

   21. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit
   whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

   21. Iuxta contumeliam loquor, perinde quasi nos infirmi fuerimus: imo
   in quocunque audet aliquis, per insipientiam loquor, ego quoque audeo.


   16. I say again The Apostle has a twofold design. He has it partly in
   view to expose the disgusting vanity of the false Apostles, inasmuch as
   they were such extravagant trumpeters of their own praises; and
   farther, to expostulate with the Corinthians, because they shut him up
   to the necessity of glorying, contrary to the inclinations of his own
   mind. "I say again," says he. For he had abundantly shown previously,
   that there was no reason, why he should be despised. He had also shown
   at the same time, that he was very unlike others, and therefore ought
   not to have his grounds of glorying estimated according to the rule of
   their measure. Thus he again shows, for what purpose he had hitherto
   gloried -- that he might clear his apostleship from contempt; for if
   the Corinthians had done their duty, he would not have said one word as
   to this matter.

   Otherwise now as a fool "If I am reckoned by you a fool, allow me at
   least to make use of my right and liberty -- that is, to speak
   foolishly after the manner of fools." Thus he reproves the false
   Apostles, who, while they were exceedingly silly in this respect, were
   not merely borne with by the Corinthians, but were received with great
   applause. He afterwards explains what kind of folly it is -- the
   publishing of his own praises. While they did so without end and
   without measure, he intimates that it was a thing to which he was
   unaccustomed; for he says, for a little while For I take this clause as
   referring to time, so that the meaning is, that Paul did not wish to
   continue it long, but assumed, as it were, for the moment, the person
   of another, and immediately thereafter laid it aside, as we are
   accustomed to pass over lightly those things that are foreign to our
   object, while fools occupy themselves constantly (en parergois) [837]
   in matters of inferior moment.

   17. What I speak, I speak not after the Lord His disposition, it is
   true, had an eye to God, but the outward appearance [838] might seem
   unsuitable to a servant of the Lord. At the same time, the things that
   Paul confesses respecting himself, he, on the other hand, condemns in
   the false Apostles. [839] For it was not his intention to praise
   himself, but simply to contrast himself with them, with the view of
   humbling them. [840] Hence he transfers to his own person what belonged
   to them, that he may thus open the eyes of the Corinthians. What I have
   rendered boldness, is in the Greek hupostasis, as to the meaning of
   which term we have spoken in the [62]ninth chapter. (2 Corinthians
   9:4.) Subject-matter [841] or substance, unquestionably, would not be
   at all suitable here. [842]

   18. Since many glory. The meaning is -- Should any one say to me, by
   way of objection, that what I do is faulty, what then as to others? Are
   not they my leaders? Am I alone, or am I the first, in glorying
   according to the flesh? Why should that be reckoned praiseworthy in
   them, that is imputed to me as a fault?" So far then is Paul from
   ambition in recounting his own praises, that he is contented to be
   blamed on that account, provided he exposes the vanity of the false
   apostles.

   To glory after the flesh, is to boast one's self, rather in what has a
   tendency towards show, than in a good conscience. For the term flesh,
   here, has a reference to the world -- when we seek after praise from
   outward masks, which have a showy appearance before the world, and are
   regarded as excellent. In place of this term he had a little before
   made use of the expression -- in appearance. (2 Corinthians 10:7.)

   19. For ye bear with fools willingly. He calls them wise -- in my
   opinion, ironically. He was despised by them, which could not have
   been, had they not been puffed up with the greatest arrogance [843] He
   says, therefore -- "Since you are so wise, act the part of wise men in
   bearing with me, whom you treat with contempt, as you would a fool."
   Hence I infer, that this discourse is not addressed to all
   indiscriminately, but some particular persons are reproved, who
   conducted themselves in an unkind manner. [844]

   20. For ye bear with it, if any one. There are three ways in which this
   may be understood. He may be understood as reproving the Corinthians in
   irony, because they could not endure any thing, as is usually the case
   with effeminate persons; or he charges them with indolence, because
   they had given themselves up to the false Apostles in a disgraceful
   bondage; or he repeats, as it were, in the person of another, what was
   spitefully affirmed respecting himself, [845] as if he claimed for
   himself a tyrannical authority over them. The second meaning is
   approved by Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Augustine, and hence it is
   commonly received; and, indeed, it corresponds best with the context,
   although the third is not less in accordance with my views. For we see,
   how he was calumniated from time to time by the malevolent, as if he
   domineered tyrannically, while he was very far from doing so. As,
   however, the other meaning is more generally received, I have no
   objection, that it should be held as the true one.

   Now this statement will correspond with the preceding one in this way:
   "You bear with every thing from others, if they oppress you, if they
   demand what belongs to you, if they treat you disdainfully. Why then
   will you not bear with me, as they are in no respect superior to me?"
   For as to his saying that he is not weak, he means that he had been
   endowed by God with such excellent graces, that he ought not to be
   looked upon as of the common order. For the word weak has a more
   extensive signification, as we shall see again ere long.

   It has been the invariable custom, and will be so to the end, to resist
   contumaciously [846] the servants of God, to get enraged on the least
   occasion, [847] to grumble and murmur incessantly, to complain of even
   a moderate strictness, [848] to hold all discipline in abhorrence;
   while, on the other hand, they put themselves under servile subjection
   to false apostles, impostors, or mere worthless pretenders, give them
   liberty to do any thing whatever, and patiently submit to and endure,
   whatever burden they may choose to impose upon them. Thus, at the
   present day, you will scarcely find one in thirty, who will put his
   neck willingly under Christ's yoke, while all have endured with
   patience a tyranny so severe as that of the Pope. Those very persons
   are all at once in an uproar, [849] in opposition to the fatherly and
   truly salutary reproofs of their pastors, who, on the other hand, had
   formerly swallowed down quietly every kind of insult, even the most
   atrocious, from the monks. [850] Are not those worthy of Antichrist's
   torturing rack, rather than of Christ's mild sway, who have ears so
   tender and backward to listen to the truth? But thus it has been from
   the beginning.

   21. Nay, in whatsoever. Paul had asked, why the Corinthians showed more
   respect to others than to him, while he had not been by any means weak,
   that is, contemptible. He now confirms this, because, if a comparison
   had been entered upon, he would not have been inferior to any one in
   any department of honor.

   2 Corinthians 11:22-29

   22. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they
   the seed of Abraham? so am I.

   22. Hebraei sunt? Ego quoque. Israelitae sunt? Ego quoque: semen
   Abrahae sunt? Ego quoque.

   23. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am more; in
   labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more
   frequent, in deaths oft.

   23. Ministri Christi sunt? Desipiens loquor, plus ego; in laboribus
   abundantius, in plagis supra modum, in carceribus copiosius, in
   mortibus saepe.

   24. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

   24. A Iudaeis quinquies quadraginta plagas accepi una minus.

   25. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
   shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

   25. Ter virgis caesus sum, semel lapidatus sum, ter naufragium feci,
   noctes et dies egi in profundo.

   26. In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
   perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in
   the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils
   among false brethren;

   26. In itineribus saepe, periculis fluminum, periculis latronum,
   periculis ex genere, periculis ex Gentibus, periculis in urbe,
   periculis in deserto, periculis in mari, periculis in falsis fratribus:

   27. In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and
   thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

   27. In labore et molestia, in vigiliis saepe, in fame et siti, in
   ieiuniis saepe, in frigore et nuditate:

   28. Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
   daily, the care of all the churches.

   28. Praeter ea quae extrinsecus accidunt, quotidiana mea moles, [851]
   sollicitudo omnium Ecclesiarum.

   29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?

   29. Quis infirmatur, et ego non infirmor? Quis offenditur, et ego non
   uror?


   22. He now, by enumerating particular instances, lets them see more
   distinctly, that he would not by any means be found inferior, if
   matters came to a contest. And in the first place, he makes mention of
   the glory of his descent, of which his rivals chiefly vaunted. "If,"
   says he, "they boast of illustrious descent, I shall be on a level with
   them, for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham." This is a
   silly and empty boast, and yet Paul makes use of three terms to express
   it; nay more, he specifies, as it were, three different marks of
   excellence. By this repetition, in my opinion, he indirectly reproves
   their folly, inasmuch as they placed the sum-total [852] of their
   excellence in a thing that was so trivial, [853] and this boasting was
   incessantly in their mouth, so as to be absolutely disgusting, as vain
   men are accustomed to pour forth empty bravadoes as to a mere nothing.

   As to the term Hebrews, it appears from Genesis 11:15, that it denotes
   descent, and is derived from Heber; and farther, it is probable, that
   Abraham himself is so called in Genesis 14:13, in no other sense than
   this -- that he was descended from that ancestor. [854] Not altogether
   without some appearance of truth is the conjecture of those, who
   explain the term to mean those dwelling beyond the river. [855] We do
   not read, it is true, that any one was called so before Abraham, who
   had passed over the river, when he quitted his native country, and
   afterwards the appellation came to be a customary one among his
   posterity, as appears from the history of Joseph. The termination,
   however, shows that it is expressive of descent, and the passage, that
   I have quoted, abundantly confirms it. [856]

   23. Are they ministers of Christ? Now when he is treating of matters
   truly praiseworthy, he is no longer satisfied with being on an equality
   with them, but exalts himself above them. For their carnal glories he
   has previously been scattering like smoke by a breath of wind, [857] by
   placing in opposition to them those which he had of a similar kind; but
   as they had nothing of solid worth, he on good grounds separates
   himself from their society, when he has occasion to glory in good
   earnest. For to be a servant of Christ is a thing that is much more
   honorable and illustrious, than to be the first-born among all the
   first-born of Abraham's posterity. Again, however, with the view of
   providing against calumnies, he premises that he speaks as a fool
   "Imagine this," says he, "to be foolish boasting: it is, nevertheless,
   true."

   In labors. By these things he proves that he is a more eminent servant
   of Christ, and then truly we have a proof that may be relied upon, when
   deeds instead of words are brought forward. He uses the term labors
   here in the plural number, and afterwards labor What difference there
   is between the former and the latter I do not see, unless perhaps it
   be, that he speaks here in a more general way, including those things
   that he afterwards enumerates in detail. In the same way we may also
   understand the term deaths to mean any kind of perils that in a manner
   threatened present death, instances of which he afterwards specifies.
   "I have given proof of myself in deaths often, in labors oftener
   still." He had made use of the term deaths in the same sense in the
   first chapter. (2 Corinthians 1:10.)

   24. From the Jews. It is certain that the Jews had at that time been
   deprived of jurisdiction, but as this was a kind of moderate punishment
   (as they termed it) it is probable that it was allowed them. Now the
   law of God was to this effect, that those who did not deserve capital
   punishment should be beaten in the presence of a judge, (Deuteronomy
   25:2, 3,) provided not more than forty stripes were inflicted, lest the
   body should be disfigured or mutilated by cruelty. Now it is probable,
   that in process of time it became customary to stop at the thirty-ninth
   lash, [858] lest perhaps they should on any occasion, from undue
   warmth, exceed the number prescribed by God. Many such precautions,
   [859] prescribed by the Rabbins, [860] are to be found among the Jews,
   which make some restriction upon the permission that the Lord had
   given. Hence, perhaps, in process of time, (as things generally
   deteriorate,) they came to think, that all criminals should be beaten
   with stripes to that number, though the Lord did not prescribe, how far
   severity should go, but where it was to stop; unless perhaps you prefer
   to receive what is stated by others, that they exercised greater
   cruelty upon Paul. This is not at all improbable, for if they had been
   accustomed ordinarily to practice this severity upon all, he might have
   said that he was beaten according to custom. Hence the statement of the
   number is expressive of extreme severity.

   25. Thrice was I beaten with rods Hence it appears, that the Apostle
   suffered many things, of which no mention is made by Luke; for he makes
   mention of only one stoning, [861] one scourging, and one shipwreck. We
   have not, however, a complete narrative, nor is there mention made in
   it of every particular that occurred, but only of the principal things.

   By perils from the nation he means those that befell him from his own
   nation, in consequence of the hatred, that was kindled against him
   among all the Jews. On the other hand, he had the Gentiles as his
   adversaries; and in the third place snares were laid for him by false
   brethren. Thus it happened, that

   for Christ's name's sake he was hated by all.
   (Matthew 10:22.)

   By fastings I understand those that are voluntary, as he has spoken
   previously of hunger and want. Such were the tokens by which he showed
   himself, and on good grounds, to be an eminent servant of Christ. For
   how may we better distinguish Christ's servants than by proofs so
   numerous, so various, and so important? On the other hand, while those
   effeminate boasters [862] had done nothing for Christ, and had suffered
   nothing for him, they, nevertheless, impudently vaunted.

   It is asked, however, whether any one can be a servant of Christ, that
   has not been tried with so many evils, perils, and vexations? I answer,
   that all these things are not indispensably requisite on the part of
   all; [863] but where these things are seen, there is, undoubtedly, a
   greater and more illustrious testimony afforded. That man, therefore,
   who will be signalized by so many marks of distinction, will not
   despise those that are less illustrious, and less thoroughly tried, nor
   will he on that account be elated with pride; but still, whenever there
   is occasion for it, he will be prepared, after Paul's example, to exult
   with a holy triumph, in opposition to pretenders [864] and worthless
   persons, provided he has an eye to Christ, not to himself -- for
   nothing but pride or ambition could corrupt and tarnish all these
   praises. For the main thing is -- that we serve Christ with a pure
   conscience. All other things are, as it were, additional.

   28. Besides those things that are without "Besides those things," says
   he, "which come upon me from all sides, and are as it were
   extraordinary, what estimate must be formed of that ordinary burden
   that constantly presses upon me -- the care that I have of all the
   Churches." The care of all the Churches he appropriately calls his
   ordinary burden. For I have taken the liberty of rendering episustasin
   in this way, as it sometimes means -- whatever presses upon us. [865]

   Whoever is concerned in good earnest as to the Church of God, stirs up
   himself and bears a heavy burden, which presses upon his shoulders.
   What a picture we have here of a complete minister, embracing in his
   anxieties and aims not one Church merely, or ten, or thirty, but all of
   them together, so that he instructs some, confirms others, exhorts
   others, gives counsel to some, and applies a remedy to the diseases of
   others! Now from Paul's words we may infer, that no one can have a
   heartfelt concern for the Churches, without being harassed with many
   difficulties; for the government of the Church is no pleasant
   occupation, in which we may exercise ourselves agreeably and with
   delight of heart, [866] but a hard and severe warfare, as has been
   previously mentioned, (2 Corinthians 10:4,) -- Satan from time to time
   giving us as much trouble as he can, and leaving no stone unturned to
   annoy us.

   29. Who is weak. How many there are that allow all offenses to pass by
   unheeded -- who either despise the infirmities of brethren, or trample
   them under foot! This, however, arises from their having no concern for
   the Church. For concern, undoubtedly, produces sumpatheian (sympathy,)
   [867] which leads the Minister of Christ to participate in the feelings
   of all, [868] and put himself in the place of all, that he may suit
   himself to all.

   Wolfius, that the Jews in modern times make use of the same number of
   stripes -- thirty-nine -- in punishing offenders, there being evidence
   of this from what is stated by Uriel Acosta, who, in his Life,

   forty.' They also thought it right to stop under forty, lest the person
   who counted should make a mistake, and the criminal get more than forty
   stripes, which would be injustice, as the law required only forty." --

   was allowed to count for three stripes, the number of strokes never
   exceeded thirteen, which made thirty-nine stripes." -- Bloomfield. --

   [861] "Once was I stoned." Paley remarks in his "Horae Paulinae," that
   this clause, "when confronted with the history," (contained in the Acts
   of the Apostles,) "furnishes the nearest approach to a contradiction,
   without a contradiction being actually incurred, of any that he
   remembers to have met with." While the narrative contained in the Acts
   of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in which Paul was
   actually stoned, (Acts 14:19,) there was, previously to that, "an
   assault" made upon Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, "both of the Gentiles,
   and also of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and
   to stone them, but they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and
   Derbe." (Acts 14:5, 6.) "Now had the assault,'" says Paley, "been
   completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown, as it
   relates that preparations were made both by Jews and Gentiles to stone
   Paul and his companions; or even had the account of this transaction
   stopped, without going on to inform us that Paul and his companions
   were aware of their danger and fled, a contradiction between the
   history and the Apostle would have ensued. Truth is necessarily
   consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not
   having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of
   contradiction without falling into it." -- Ed.

   [865] The word (episustasis) is translated or rather paraphrased by
   Beza as follows: "Agmen illud in me consurgens;" -- "That troop which
   rises up together against me." He adds by way of explanation: "Certum
   est enim episustasin dici multitudinem quae adversus aliquem coierit,
   idque non semel, sed repetitis vicibus. Quia igitur multiplices erant
   curae, quarum tanquam agmine magis ac magis veluti obruebatur,
   Apostolus usus est translatitie hoc vocabulo, admodum significanter;"
   -- "For it is certain that episustasin denotes a multitude that has
   come together against any one, and that not once merely, but in
   repeated instances. As, therefore, there were manifold cares, by which
   rushing upon him like a troop, more and more, he was in a manner
   overwhelmed, the Apostle, by way of metaphor, made use of this term
   very significantly." Raphelius considers the term to be synonymous with
   an expression made use of by Cicero: "concursus occupationum;" -- "a
   crowding together of engagements." -- (Cic. Fam. 7:33.) -- Ed.

   2 Corinthians 11:30-33

   30. If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
   mine infirmities.

   30. Si gloriari oportet, in iis quae infirmitatis meae sunt gloriabor.

   31. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for
   evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

   31. Deus et Pater Domini nostri Iesu Christi novit, qui est benedictus
   in saecula, quod non mentiar.

   32. In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the
   Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me;

   32. Damasci Aretas, regius gentis praefectus, custodiebat urbem
   Damascenorum, volens me apprehendere. (Acts 9:24, 25.)

   33. And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and
   escaped his hands.

   33. Et per fenestram demissus fui in sporta per muros, atque effugi
   manus eius.


   30. If he must glory. Here we have the conclusion, drawn from all that
   has gone before -- that Paul is more inclined to boast of those things
   that are connected with his infirmity, that is, those things which
   might, in the view of the world, bring him contempt, rather than glory,
   as, for example, hunger, thirst, imprisonments, stonings, stripes, and
   the like -- those things, in truth, that we are usually as much ashamed
   of, as of things that incur great dishonor. [869]

   31. The God and Father As he was about to relate a singular feat, [870]
   which, at the same time, was not well known, he confirms it by making
   use of an oath. Observe, however, what is the form of a pious oath,
   [871] -- when, for the purpose of declaring the truth, we reverently
   call God as our witness. Now this persecution was, as it were, Paul's
   first apprenticeship, [872] as appears from Luke, (Acts 9:23-25); but
   if, while yet a raw recruit, he was exercised in such beginnings, what
   shall we think of him, when a veteran soldier? As, however, flight
   gives no evidence of a valiant spirit, it may be asked, why it is that
   he makes mention of his flight? I answer, that the gates of the royal
   city having been closed, clearly showed with what rage the wicked were
   inflamed against him; and it was on no light grounds that they had been
   led to entertain such a feeling, [873] for if Paul had not fought for
   Christ with a new and unusual activity, the wicked would never have
   been thrown into such a commotion. His singular perseverance, however,
   shone forth chiefly in this -- that, after escaping from so severe a
   persecution, he did not cease to stir up the whole world against him,
   by prosecuting fearlessly the Lord's work.

   It may be, however, that he proceeds to mock those ambitious men, who,
   while they had never had experience of any thing but applauses, favors,
   honorable salutations, and agreeable lodgings, wished to be held in the
   highest esteem. For, in opposition to this, he relates, that he was
   shut in, so that he could with difficulty save his life by a miserable
   and ignominious flight.

   Some, however, ask, whether it was lawful for Paul to leap over the
   walls, inasmuch as it was a capital crime to do so? I answer, in the
   first place, that it is not certain, whether that punishment was
   sanctioned by law in the East; and farther, that even if it was so,
   Paul, nevertheless, was guilty of no crime, because he did not do this
   as an enemy, or for sport, but from necessity. For the law would not
   punish a man, that would throw himself down from the walls to save his
   life from the flames; and what difference is there between a fire, and
   a fierce attack from robbers? We must always, in connection with laws,
   have an eye to reason and equity. [874] This consideration will exempt
   Paul entirely from blame.

   2 Corinthians 12:1-5

   1. It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
   visions and revelations of the Lord.

   1. Gloriari sane non expedit mihi: veniam enim ad visiones et
   revelatones Domini.

   2. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the
   body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God
   knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

   2. Novi hominem in Christo ante annos quatuordecim (sive in corpore,
   nescio: sive extra corpus, nescio, Deus novit) eiusmodi, inquam,
   hominem raptum fuisse usque in tertium coelum:

   3. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I
   cannot tell: God knoweth;)

   3. Scio de eiusmodi homine (sive in corpore, nescio: sive extra corpus,
   nescio, Deus scit.)

   4. How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
   words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

   4. Quod raptus sit in Paradisum, et audierit verba ineffabilia, [875]
   quae non licet [876] homini loqui.

   5. Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in
   mine infirmities.

   5. De eiusmodi homine gloriabor: de me ipso non gloriabor, nisi in
   infirmitatibus meis.


   1. It is not expedient for me to glory Now, when as it were in the
   middle of the course, he restrains himself from proceeding farther, and
   in this way he most appropriately reproves the impudence of his rivals
   and declares that it is with reluctance, that he engages in this sort
   of contest with them. For what a shame it was to scrape together from
   every quarter commendations, or rather to go a-begging for them, that
   they might be on a level with so distinguished a man! As to the latter,
   he admonishes them by his own example, that the more numerous and the
   more excellent the graces by which any one of us is distinguished, so
   much the less ought he to think of his own excellence. For such a
   thought is exceedingly dangerous, because, like one entering into a
   labyrinth, the person is immediately dazzled, so as to be too
   quick-sighted in discerning his gifts, [877] while in the mean time he
   is ignorant of himself. Paul is afraid, lest this should befall him.
   The graces conferred by God are, indeed, to be acknowledged, that we
   may be aroused, -- first, to gratitude for them, and secondly, to the
   right improvement of them; but to take occasion from them to boast --
   that is what cannot be done without great danger.

   For I will come [878] to visions. "I shall not creep on the ground, but
   will be constrained to mount aloft. Hence I am afraid, lest the height
   of my gifts should hurry me on, so as to lead me to forget myself." And
   certainly, if Paul had gloried ambitiously, he would have fallen
   headlong from a lofty eminence; for it is humility alone that can give
   stability to our greatness in the sight of God.

   Between visions and revelations there is this distinction -- that a
   revelation is often made either in a dream, or by an oracle, without
   any thing being presented to the eye, while a vision is scarcely ever
   afforded without a revelation, or in other words, without the Lord's
   discovering what is meant by it. [879]

   2. I knew a man in Christ As he was desirous to restrain himself within
   bounds, he merely singles out one instance, and that, too, he handles
   in such a way as to show, that it is not from inclination that he
   brings it forward; for why does he speak in the person of another
   rather than in his own? It is as though he had said, "I should have
   preferred to be silent, I should have preferred to keep the whole
   matter suppressed within my own mind, but those persons [880] will not
   allow me. I shall mention it, therefore, as it were in a stammering
   way, that it may be seen that I speak through constraint." Some think
   that the clause in Christ is introduced for the purpose of confirming
   what he says. I view it rather as referring to the disposition, so as
   to intimate that Paul has not here an eye to himself, but looks to
   Christ exclusively.

   When he confesses, that he does not know whether he was in the body, or
   out of the body, he expresses thereby the more distinctly the greatness
   of the revelation. For he means, that God dealt with him in such a way,
   [881] that he did not himself understand the manner of it. Nor should
   this appear to us incredible, inasmuch as he sometimes manifests
   himself to us in such a way, that the manner of his doing so is,
   nevertheless, hid from our view. [882] At the same time, this does not,
   in any degree, detract from the assurance of faith, which rests simply
   on this single point -- that we are aware that God speaks to us. Nay
   more, let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those
   things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to
   God. (Deuteronomy 29:29.) He says, then, that he does not know, whether
   he was wholly taken up -- soul and body -- into heaven, or whether it
   was his soul only, that was caught up

   Fourteen years ago Some [883] enquire, also, as to the place, but it
   does not belong to us to satisfy their curiosity. [884] The Lord
   manifested himself to Paul in the beginning by a vision, when he
   designed to convert him from Judaism to the faith of the gospel, but he
   was not then admitted as yet into those secrets, as he needed even to
   be instructed by Ananias in the first rudiments. [885] (Acts 9:12.)
   That vision, therefore, was nothing but a preparation, with the view of
   rendering him teachable. It may be, that, in this instance, he refers
   to that vision, of which he makes mention also, according to Luke's
   narrative. (Acts 22:17.) There is no occasion, however, for our giving
   ourselves much trouble as to these conjectures, as we see that Paul
   himself kept silence respecting it for fourteen years, [886] and would
   not have said one word in reference to it, had not the unreasonableness
   of malignant persons constrained him.

   Even to the third heaven. He does not here distinguish between the
   different heavens in the manner of the philosophers, so as to assign to
   each planet its own heaven. On the other hand, the number three is made
   use of (kat ezochen) by way of eminence, to denote what is highest and
   most complete. Nay more, the term heaven, taken by itself, denotes here
   the blessed and glorious kingdom of God, which is above all the
   spheres, [887] and the firmament itself, and even the entire frame-work
   of the world. Paul, however, not contenting himself with the simple
   term, [888] adds, that he had reached even the greatest height, and the
   innermost recesses. For our faith scales heaven and enters it, and
   those that are superior to others in knowledge get higher in degree and
   elevation, but to reach the third heavens has been granted to very few.

   4. In paradise [889] As every region that is peculiarly agreeable and
   delightful [890] is called in the Scriptures the garden of God, it came
   from this to be customary among the Greeks to employ the term paradise
   to denote the heavenly glory, even previously to Christ's advent, as
   appears from Ecclesiasticus. (Sirach, 40, 17, 27.) It is also used in
   this sense in Luke 23:43, in Christ's answer to the robber -- "To-day
   shalt thou be with me in paradise," that is, "Thou shalt enjoy the
   presence of God, in the condition and life of the blessed."

   Heard unspeakable words By words here I do not understand things, as
   the term is wont to be made use of after the manner of the Hebrews;
   [891] for the word heard would not correspond with this. Now if any one
   inquires, what they were, the answer is easy -- that it is not without
   good reason that they are called unspeakable [892] words, and such as
   it is unlawful to utter. Some one, however, will reply, that what Paul
   heard was, consequently, needless and useless, for what purpose did it
   serve to hear, what was to be buried in perpetual silence? I answer,
   that this took place for the sake of Paul himself, for one who had such
   arduous difficulties awaiting him, enough to break a thousand hearts,
   required to be strengthened by special means, that he might not give
   way, but might persevere undaunted. [893] Let us consider for a little,
   how many adversaries his doctrine had, and of what sort they were; and
   farther, with what a variety of artifices it was assailed, and then we
   shall wonder no longer, why he heard more than it was lawful for him to
   utter

   From this, too, we may gather a most useful admonition as to setting
   bounds to knowledge. We are naturally prone to curiosity. Hence,
   neglecting altogether, or tasting but slightly, and carelessly,
   doctrine that tends to edification, we are hurried on to frivolous
   questions. Then there follow upon this -- boldness and rashness, so
   that we do not hesitate to decide on matters unknown, and concealed.

   From these two sources has sprung up a great part [894] of scholastic
   theology, and every thing, which that trifler Dionysius [895] has been
   so daring as to contrive in reference to the Heavenly Hierarchies, It
   becomes us so much the more to keep within bounds, [896] so as not to
   seek to know any thing, but what the Lord has seen it good to reveal to
   his Church. Let this be the limit of our knowledge.

   5. Of such a man It is as though he had said "I have just ground for
   glorying, but I do not willingly avail myself of it. For it is more in
   accordance with my design, to glory in my infirmities If, however,
   those malicious persons harass me any farther, and constrain me to
   boast more than I am inclined to do, they shall feel that they have to
   do with a man, whom God has illustriously honored, and raised up on
   high, with a view to his exposing their follies.

   (gn) gan; and of the word (phrds) pardes, in Nehemiah 2:8, Ecclesiastes

   elevated and cultivated; in Armenian, pardes denotes a garden around

   [895] Calvin refers here to one Dionysius, whose writings appear to
   have been looked upon by many in Calvin's times, as having been
   composed by Dionysius the Areopagite, who was converted by Paul at
   Athens. (Acts 17:34.) A copy of the work referred to, printed at Paris
   in 1555, bears the following title: "S. Dionysii Areopagitae, Martyris
   Inclyti, Athenarum Episcopi, et Galliarum Apostoli, opera-Translatio
   Noua Ambrosii Florentini," etc.; -- "The works of St. Dionysius the
   Areopagite, the renowned Martyr, Bishop of Athens, and Apostle of the
   Gauls -- a New Translation by Ambrosius Florentine," etc. -- Calvin, in
   his Institutes, (volume 1,) when treating of angels, adverts to the
   writings of Dionysius, in the following terms: "None can deny that
   Dionysius (whoever he may have been) has many shrewd and subtle
   disquisitions in his Celestial Hierarchy, but on looking at them more
   closely, every one must see that they are merely idle talk. The duty of
   a theologian, however, is not to tickle the ear, but confirm the
   conscience, by teaching what is true, certain, and useful. When you
   read the work of Dionysius, you would think that the man had come down
   from heaven, and was relating, not what he had learned, but what he had
   actually seen. Paul, however, though he was carried to the third
   heaven, so far from delivering any thing of the kind positively,
   declares, that it was not lawful for man to speak the secrets which he
   had seen. Bidding adieu, therefore, to that nugatory wisdom, let us
   endeavor to ascertain from the simple doctrine of Scripture, what it is
   the Lord's pleasure that we should know concerning angels." -- Beza, in
   his Annotations on 1 Corinthians 3:15, when expounding the expression
   -- "he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire," makes mention of
   Dionysius, as having been, in his opinion, Bishop of Corinth, and
   speaks of him as having devoted himself to unprofitable speculations,
   and as harassing himself, for the most part in vain, in describing the
   Celestial Hierarchy. -- The Rhemish Translators, when commenting on
   Acts 17:34, contend for the genuineness of the writings referred to.
   "Dionysius Areopaita This is that famous Denys that first converted
   France, and wrote those notable and divine works -- 'De Ecclesiastica
   et Caelesti Hierarchia, de diuinis nominibus,' and others; in which he
   confirmeth, and proveth plainely, almost all things that the Church now
   useth in the ministration of the Holy Sacrament, and affirmeth that he
   learned them of the Apostles, giving also testimony for the Catholike
   faith in most things now controuersed, so plainely that our adversaries
   have no shift but to deny this Denys to have been the author of them,
   raining that they be another's of later age." To these statements Dr.
   Fulke, in his elaborate work in refutation of the errors of the Rhemish
   Translators, (p. 403,) replies as follows: "That Dionysius Areopagita
   was author of those bookes which now beare his name, you bring no
   proofe at all. We alleage that Eusebius, Hierome, Gennadius, neuer
   heard of his writings, for if they had heard, Dionysius Areopagita
   should have been registered by them among ecclesiasticall writers." --
   It is stated by Mosheim in his Ecclesiastical History, (London 1825,)
   volume 2, n. (u), that "the spuriousness of these works is now
   universally granted by the most learned and impartial of the Roman
   Catholic writers, as they contain accounts of many events that happened
   several ages after the time of Dionysius, and were not at all mentioned
   until after the fifth century." Turretine in his Theology brings
   forward, at considerable length, evidence to show, that the work
   referred to was not, as pretended, the production of Dionysius the
   Areopagite, who was "sunchronos Apostolis," ("a contemporary of the
   Apostles,") but was written by an author of much later date -- born in
   the fifth century. -- Turretini Theologia, (Genevae, 1690,) tom. 3, pp.

   2 Corinthians 12:6-10

   6. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I
   will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me
   above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

   6. Nam si voluero gloriari, non ero insipiens: veritatem enim dicam:
   sed supersedeo: ne quis de me cogitet supra id quod videt esse me, aut
   quod audit ex me.

   7. And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of
   the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
   messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above
   measure.

   7. Et en exellentia revelationum suppra modum efferrer, datus mihi fuit
   stimulus carni, nuntius Satanae qui me colaphis caederet, ne supra
   modum efferrer.

   8. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from
   me.

   8. Supra hoc ter Dominum rogavi, ut discederet a me:

   9. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
   strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
   rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
   me.

   9. Et dixit mihi: Sufficit tibi gratia mea: nam virtus mea in
   infirmitate perficitur: libentissime igitur gloriabor super
   infirmitatibus meis, ut inhabitet in me virtus Christi.

   10. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
   necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when
   I am weak, then am I strong.

   10. Quamobrem placeo nihi in infirmitatibus, in contumeliis, in
   necessitatibus, in persequutionibus, in anxietatibus pro Christo: quum
   enim infirmus sum, tinc robustus sum.


   6. For if I should desire. Lest what he had said, as to his having no
   inclination to glory, should be turned into an occasion of calumny, and
   malevolent persons should reply -- "You are not inclined for it,
   because it is not in your power, he anticipates such a reply. "I would
   have it quite in my power," says he, "on good grounds; nor would I be
   justly accused of vanity, for I have ground to go upon, but I refrain
   from it." He employs the term folly here in a different sense from what
   he had done previously, for even those that boast on good grounds act a
   silly and disgusting part, if there appears any thing of boasting or
   ambition. The folly, however, is more offensive and insufferable, if
   any one boasts groundlessly, or, in other words, pretends to be what he
   is not; for in that case there is impudence in addition to silliness.
   The Apostle here proceeded upon it as a set, tied matter, that his
   glorying was as humble as it was well founded. Erasmus has rendered it
   -- "I spare you," [897] but I prefer to understand it as meaning -- "I
   refrain," or, as I have rendered it, "I forbear."

   Lest any one should think of me He adds the reason -- because he is
   contented to occupy the station, which God has assigned him. "My
   appearance," says he, "and speech do not give promise of any thing
   illustrious in me: I have no objection, therefore, to be lightly
   esteemed." Here we perceive what great modesty there was in this man,
   inasmuch as he was not at all concerned on account of his meanness,
   which he discovered in his appearance and speech, while he was
   replenished with such a superiority of gifts. There would, however, be
   no inconsistency in explaining it in this way, that satisfied with the
   reality itself, he says nothing respecting himself, that he may thus
   reprove indirectly the false Apostles, who gloried in themselves as to
   many things, none of which were to be seen. What I mentioned first,
   however, is what I rather approve of.

   7. And lest through the superiority of revelations. Here we have a
   second reason -- that God, designing to repress in him every approach
   to insolence, subdued him with a rod. That rod he calls a goad, by a
   metaphor taken from oxen. The word flesh is, in the Greek, in the
   dative [898] Hence Erasmus has rendered it "by the flesh." I prefer,
   however, to understand him as meaning, that the prickings of this goad
   were in his flesh.

   Now it is asked, what this goad was. Those act a ridiculous part, who
   think that Paul was tempted to lust. We must therefore repudiate that
   fancy. [899] Some have supposed, that he was harassed with frequent
   pains in the head. Chrysostom is rather inclined to think, that the
   reference is to Hymeneus and Alexander, and the like, because,
   instigated by the devil, they occasioned Paul very much annoyance. My
   opinion is, that under this term is comprehended every kind of
   temptation, with which Paul was exercised. For flesh here, in my
   opinion, denotes -- not the body, but that part of the soul which has
   not yet been regenerated. "There was given to me a goad that my flesh
   might be spurred up by it, for I am not yet so spiritual, as not to be
   exposed to temptations according to the flesh."

   He calls it farther the messenger of Satan on this ground, that as all
   temptations are sent by Satan, so, whenever they assail us, they warn
   us that Satan is at hand. Hence, at every apprehension of temptation,
   it becomes us to arouse ourselves, and arm ourselves with promptitude
   for repelling Satan's assaults. It was most profitable for Paul to
   think of this, because this consideration did not allow him to exult
   like a man that was off his guard. [900] For the man, who is as yet
   beset with dangers, and dreads the enemy, is not prepared to celebrate
   a triumph. "The Lord, says he, has provided me with an admirable
   remedy, against being unduly elated; for, while I am employed in taking
   care that Satan may not take advantage of me, I am kept back from
   pride."

   At the same time, God did not cure him by this means exclusively, but
   also by humbling him. For he adds, to buffet me; by which expression he
   elegantly expresses this idea. -- that he has been brought under
   control. [901] For to be buffeted is a severe kind of indignity.
   Accordingly, if any one has had his face made black and blue, [902] he
   does not, from a feeling of shame, venture to expose himself openly in
   the view of men. In like manner, whatever be the infirmity under which
   we labor, let us bear in mind, that we are, as it were, buffeted by the
   Lord, with the view of making us ashamed, that we may learn humility.
   Let this be carefully reflected upon by those, especially, who are
   otherwise distinguished by illustrious virtues, if they have any
   mixture of defects, if they are persecuted by any with hatred, if they
   are assailed by any revilings -- that these things are not merely rods
   of the Heavenly Master, but buffetings, to fill them with shame, and
   beat down all forwardness. [903] Now let all the pious take notice as
   to this, that they may see [904] how dangerous a thing the "poison of
   pride" is, as Augustine speaks in his third sermon "On the words of the
   Apostle," inasmuch as it "cannot be cured except by poison." [905] And
   unquestionably, as it was the cause of man's ruin, so it is the last
   vice with which we have to contend, for other vices have a connection
   with evil deeds, but this is to be dreaded in connection with the best
   actions; and farther, it naturally clings to us so obstinately, and is
   so deeply rooted, that it is extremely difficult to extirpate it.

   Let us carefully consider, who it is that here speaks -- He had
   overcome so many dangers, tortures, and other evils -- had triumphed
   over all the enemies of Christ -- had driven away the fear of death --
   had, in fine, renounced the world; and yet he had not altogether
   subdued pride. Nay more, there awaited him a conflict so doubtful, that
   he could not overcome without being buffeted. Instructed by his
   example, let us wage war with other vices in such a way, as to lay out
   our main efforts for the subduing of this one.

   But what does this mean -- that Satan, who was a

   man-slayer [906] from the beginning, (John 8:44,)

   was a physician to Paul, and that too, not merely in the cure of the
   body, but -- what is of greater importance -- in the cure of the soul?
   I answer, that Satan, in accordance with his disposition and custom,
   had nothing else in view than to kill and to destroy, (John 10:10,) and
   that the goad, that Paul makes mention of, was dipt in deadly poison;
   but that it was a special kindness from the Lord, to render medicinal
   what was in its own nature deadly.

   8. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice. Here, also, [907] the
   number three is employed to denote frequent repetition. [908] He means,
   however, to intimate, that this annoyance had been felt by him
   distressing, inasmuch as he had so frequently prayed to be exempted
   from it. For if it had been slight, or easy to be endured, he would not
   have been so desirous to be freed from it; and yet he says that he had
   not obtained this: hence it appears, how much need he had of being
   humbled. He confirms, therefore, what he had said previously -- that he
   had, by means of this bridle, been held back from being haughty; for if
   relief from it had been for his advantage, he would never have met with
   a refusal.

   It may seem, however, to follow from this, that Paul had not by any
   means prayed in faith, if we would not make void all the promises of
   God. [909] "We read everywhere in Scripture, that we shall obtain
   whatever we ask in faith: Paul prays, and does not obtain." I answer,
   that as there are different ways of asking, so there are different ways
   of obtaining. We ask in simple terms those things as to which we have
   an express promise -- as, for example, the perfecting of God's kingdom,
   and the hallowing of his name, (Matthew 6:9,) the remission of our
   sins, and every thing that is advantageous to us; but, when we think
   that the kingdom of God can, nay must be advanced, in this particular
   manner, or in that, and that this thing, or that, is necessary for the
   hallowing of his name, we are often mistaken in our opinion. In like
   manner, we often fall into a serious mistake as to what tends to
   promote our own welfare. Hence we ask those former things confidently,
   and without any reservation, while it does not belong to us to
   prescribe the means. If, however, we specify the means, there is always
   a condition implied, though not expressed. Now Paul was not so ignorant
   as not to know this. Hence, as to the object of his prayer, there can
   be no doubt that he was heard, although he met with a refusal as to the
   express form. By this we are admonished not to give way to despondency,
   as if our prayers had been lost labor, when God does not gratify or
   comply with our wishes, but that we must be satisfied with his grace,
   that is, in respect of our not being forsaken by him. For the reason,
   why he sometimes mercifully refuses to his own people, what, in his
   wrath, he grants to the wicked, is this -- that he foresees better what
   is expedient for us, than our understanding is able to apprehend.

   9. He said to me. It is not certain, whether he had this answer by a
   special revelation, and it is not of great importance. [910] For God
   answers us, when he strengthens us inwardly by his Spirit, and sustains
   us by his consolation, so that we do not give up hope and patience. He
   bids Paul be satisfied with his grace, and, in the mean time, not
   refuse chastisement. Hence we must bear up under evil of ever so long
   continuance, because we are admirably well dealt with, when we have the
   grace of God to be our support. [911] The term grace, here, does not
   mean here, as it does elsewhere, the favor of God, but by metonymy, the
   aid of the Holy Spirit, which comes to us from the unmerited favor of
   God; and it ought to be sufficient for the pious, inasmuch as it is a
   sure and invincible support against their ever giving way.

   For my strength Our weakness may seem, as if it were an obstacle in the
   way of God's perfecting his strength in us. Paul does not merely deny
   this, but maintains, on the other hand, that it is only when our
   weakness becomes apparent, that God's strength is duly perfected. To
   understand this more distinctly, we must distinguish between God's
   strength and ours; for the word my is emphatic. "My strength," says the
   Lord, (meaning that which helps man's need -- which raises them up when
   they have fallen down, and refreshes them when they are faint,) "is
   perfected in the weakness of men;" that is, it has occasion to exert
   itself, when the weakness of men becomes manifest; and not only so, but
   it is more distinctly recognized as it ought to be. For the word
   perfected has a reference to the perception and apprehension of
   mankind, because it is not perfected unless it openly shines forth, so
   as to receive its due praise. For mankind have no taste of it, unless
   they are first convinced of the need of it, and they quickly lose sight
   of its value, if they are not constantly exercised with a feeling of
   their own weakness.

   Most gladly, therefore This latter statement confirms the exposition
   that I have given. I will glory, says he, in my infirmities, that the
   power of Christ may dwell in me [912] Hence, the man that is ashamed of
   this glorying, shuts the door upon Christ's grace, and, in a manner,
   puts it away from him. For then do we make room for Christ's grace,
   when in true humility of mind, we feel and confess our own weakness.
   The valleys are watered with rain to make them fruitful, while in the
   mean time, the high summits of the lofty mountains remain dry. [913]
   Let that man, therefore, become a valley, who is desirous to receive
   the heavenly rain of God's spiritual grace. [914]

   He adds most gladly, to show that he is influenced by such an eager
   desire for the grace of Christ, that he refuses nothing for the sake of
   obtaining it. For we see very many yielding, indeed, submission to God,
   as being afraid of incurring sacrilege in coveting his glory, but, at
   the same time, not without reluctance, or at least, less cheerfully
   than were becoming. [915]

   10. I take pleasure in infirmities There can be no doubt, that he
   employs the term weakness in different senses; for he formerly applied
   this name to the punctures that he experienced in the flesh. He now
   employs it to denote those external qualities, which occasion contempt
   in the view of the world. Having spoken, however, in a general way, of
   infirmities of every kind, he now returns to that particular
   description of them, that had given occasion for his turning aside into
   this general discourse. Let us take notice, then, that infirmity is a
   general term, and that under it is comprehended the weakness of our
   nature, as well as all tokens of abasement. Now the point in question
   was Paul's outward abasement. He proceeded farther, for the purpose of
   showing, that the Lord humbled him in every way, that, in his defects,
   the glory of God might shine forth the more resplendently, which is, in
   a manner, concealed and buried, when a man is in an elevated position.
   He now again returns to speak of his excellences, which, at the same
   time, made him contemptible in public view, instead of procuring for
   him esteem and commendation.

   For when I am weak, that is -- "The more deficiency there is in me, so
   much the more liberally does the Lord, from his strength, supply me
   with whatever he sees to be needful for me." For the fortitude of
   philosophers is nothing else than contumacy, or rather a mad
   enthusiasm, such as fanatics are accustomed to have. "If a man is
   desirous to be truly strong, let him not refuse to be at the same time
   weak Let him," I say, "be weak in himself that he may be strong in the
   Lord." (Ephesians 6:10.) Should any one object, that Paul speaks here,
   not of a failure of strength, but of poverty, and other afflictions, I
   answer, that all these things are exercises for discovering to us our
   own weakness; for if God had not exercised Paul with such trials, he
   would never have perceived so clearly his weakness. Hence, he has in
   view not merely poverty, and hardships of every kind, but also those
   effects that arise from them, as, for example, a feeling of our own
   weakness, self-distrust, and humility.

   [906] Dr. Campbell, in his Translation of the Gospels, makes use of the
   term manslayer, as Calvin does here, and makes the following
   observations in support of this rendering: "The common term for
   murderer in the New Testament is phoneus. I have here made choice of a
   less usual name, not from any disposition to trace etymologies, but
   because I think it is not without intention, that the devil, as being
   not of earthly extraction, is rather called anthropoktonos than
   phoneus, as marking, with greater precision, his ancient enmity to the
   human race. When the name murderer is applied to a rational being of a
   species different from ours, it naturally suggests, that the being so
   denominated is a destroyer of others of his own species. As this is not
   meant here, the Evangelist's term is peculiarly apposite. At the same
   time, I am sensible, that our word manslaughter means, in the language
   of the law, such killing as is, indeed, criminal, though not so
   atrocious as murder. But, in common use, it is not so limited. Heylyn
   says, to the same purpose -- a slayer of men." -- Campbell on the
   Gospels, (Edin. 1807,) volume 2. -- Ed.

   [907] Calvin alludes to what he had said as to the number three, when

   [912] The original word, episkenosHu, properly means, to pitch a tent,
   or tabernacle, upon. Raphelius quotes two passages from Polybius, in
   which the verb is used as meaning -- to enter into, and dwell in. To de
   teleutasion episokenosantes epi tas oikias "and at last, having entered
   in, and taken possession of the houses." Meta de tauta tais oikiais
   episkenosantes kateichon ten polin -- "And after these things, having
   entered into the houses, they took possession of the city." --
   CEcumenius, cited by Parkhurst, considers episkenosHu, as employed by
   the Apostle here, to be equivalent to hole en holo katoikesHu -- "may
   entirely take possession of me, and dwell in me." -- It is admirably
   well observed by Dr. Adam Clarke, that "the same Eternal WORD," (of
   whom it is said in John 1:14, that he "was made flesh, and made his
   tabernacle among us, (eskenosen en hemin,) full of grace and truth,")
   "promised to make his tabernacle with the Apostle, and gives him a
   proof that he was still the same -- full of grace and truth, by
   assuring him that his grace should be sufficient for him." -- Ed.

   in all these parts. It is fat ground, and, as you see, consisteth much
   in meadows; and if a man was to come here in the summer-time, as we do
   now, if he knew not any thing before thereof, and if he also delighted
   himself in the sight of his eyes, he might see that which would be
   delightful to him. Behold how green this valley is! also how beautiful
   with lilies!'

   2 Corinthians 12:11-15

   11. I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought
   to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very
   chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

   11. Factus sum insipiens gloriando: vos me coegistis: nam ego debueram
   a vobis commendari: nulla enim in er inferior fui summis Apostolis,
   tametsi nihil sum.

   12. Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
   patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

   12. Signa quidem apostoli peracta fuerunt inter vos, in omni patientia,
   et signis, et prodigiis, et virtutibus.

   13. For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except
   it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.

   13. Nam quid est, in quo fueritis inferiores caeteris Ecclesiis, nisi
   quod ego ipse non fui vobis onerosus? Condonate mihi hanc iniuriam.

   14. Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be
   burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children
   ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

   14. Ecce, tertio propensus animo sum, ut veniam ad vos, neque vobis ero
   oneri: non enim quaero quae vestra sunt, sed vos: etenim non esd
   parentes filiis.

   15. And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more
   abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

   15. Ego vero libentissime impendam et expendar pro animabus vestris:
   licet uberius bos diligens, minus diligar.


   11. I have become a fool Hitherto he had, by various apologies,
   solicited their forgiveness for what was contrary to his own custom and
   manner of acting, and contrary, also, to propriety, and what was due to
   his office as an Apostle -- the publishing of his own praises. Now,
   instead of soliciting, he upbraids, throwing the blame upon the
   Corinthians, who ought to have been beforehand in this. [916] For when
   the false Apostles calumniated Paul, they should have set themselves
   vigorously in opposition to them, and should have faithfully borne the
   testimony that was due to his excellences. He chides them, however,
   thus early, lest those, who were unfavorably disposed towards them,
   should put a wrong construction upon the defense which he brought
   forward, in consequence of his being constrained to it by their
   ingratitude, [917] or should persist in calumniating him.

   For in nothing We are ungrateful to God, if we allow his gifts, of
   which we are witnesses, to be disparaged, or contemned. He charges the
   Corinthians with this fault, for they knew him to be equal to the
   chiefest Apostles, and yet they lent an ear to calumniators, when they
   slandered him.

   By the chiefest Apostles some understand his rivals, who arrogated to
   themselves the precedence. [918] I understand it, however, as meaning
   -- those that were chief among the twelve. "Let me be compared with any
   one of the Apostles, [919] I have no fear, that I shall be found
   inferior." For, although Paul was on the best of terms with all the
   Apostles, so that he was prepared to extol them above himself, he,
   nevertheless, contended against their names when falsely assumed. [920]
   For the false Apostles abused this pretext, that they had been in the
   company of the twelve -- that they were in possession of all their
   views [921] -- that they were fully acquainted with all their
   institutions, and the like. Hence Paul, perceiving that they falsely
   gloried in these masks and counterfeit titles, and were successful, to
   some extent, among unlearned persons, [922] reckoned it necessary to
   enter upon a comparison of that nature. [923]

   The correction that he adds -- though I am nothing, means, that Paul
   was not disposed to claim any thing as his own, but simply gloried in
   the Lord, (2 Corinthians 10:17,) unless, perhaps, you prefer to
   consider this as a concession, in which he makes mention of what is
   thrown out against him by adversaries and slanderers. [924]

   12. The signs of an Apostle By the signs of an Apostle he means -- the
   seals, that tend to confirm the evidence of his Apostleship, or, at
   least, for the proofs and evidences of it. "God has confirmed my
   Apostleship among you to such a degree, that it stands in no need of
   proof being adduced." The first sign he makes mention of is patience --
   either because he had remained invincible, [925] by nobly withstanding
   all the assaults of Satan and his enemies, and on no occasion giving
   way; or because, regardless of his own distinction, he suffered all
   injuries patiently, endured in silence countless grievances, [926] and,
   by patience, overcame indignities. [927] For a virtue so heroic is, as
   it were, a heavenly seal, by which the Lord marks out his Apostles.

   He assigns the second place to miracles, for while he makes mention of
   signs and wonders and mighty deeds, he makes use of three terms, as he
   does elsewhere, (2 Thessalonians 2:9,) for expressing one and the same
   thing. Now he calls them signs, because they are not empty shows, but
   are appointed for the instruction of mankind -- wonders, because they
   ought, by their novelty, to arouse men, and strike them with
   astonishment -- and powers or mighty deeds, because they are more
   signal tokens of Divine power, [928] than what we behold in the
   ordinary course of nature. Farther, we know that this was the main
   design of miracles, when the gospel began to be preached -- that its
   doctrine might have greater authority given to it. Hence, the more that
   any one was endowed with the power of working miracles, so much the
   more was his ministry confirmed, as has been stated in the fifteenth
   chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. [929]

   13. What is there in which. Here is an aggravation of their ingratitude
   -- that he had been distinguished, that they might receive benefit --
   that they had derived advantage from the attestation furnished of his
   Apostleship, and had, notwithstanding, given their concurrence to the
   slanders [930] of the false Apostles. He subjoins one exception -- that
   he had not been burdensome to them; and this, by way of irony, for in
   reality this was over and above so many acts of kindness, which he had
   conferred upon them -- that he had served them gratuitously. To busy
   themselves after this, as they did, in pouring contempt upon him, what
   was this but to insult his modesty? Nay, what cruelty there was in it!
   Hence, it is not without good reason, that he sharply reproves pride so
   frantic. Forgive me this wrong, says he. For they were doubly
   ungrateful, inasmuch as they not only contemned the man, by whose acts
   of kindness they had been brought under obligation, but even turned his
   kind disposition into an occasion of reproach. Chrysostom is of
   opinion, that there is no irony implied, and that, instead of this,
   there is an expression of apology; but, if any one examines the entire
   context more narrowly, he will easily perceive, that this gloss is
   quite foreign to Paul's intention.

   14. Behold, this third time He commends his own deed, for which he had
   received a very poor requital from the Corinthians. For he says, that
   he refrained from taking their worldly substance for two reasons first,
   because he sought them, not their wealth; and secondly, because he was
   desirous to act the part of a father towards them. From this it
   appears, what commendation was due to his modesty, which occasioned him
   contempt among the Corinthians.

   I seek not yours. It is the part of a genuine and upright pastor, not
   to seek to derive gain from his sheep, but to endeavor to promote their
   welfare; though, at the same time, it is to be observed, that men are
   not to be sought with the view of having [931] every one his own
   particular followers. It is a bad thing, to be devoted to gain, or to
   undertake the office of a pastor with the view of making a trade of it;
   but for a person to draw away disciples after him, (Acts 20:30,) for
   purposes of ambition, is greatly worse. Paul, however, means, that he
   is not greedy of hire, but is concerned only for the welfare of souls.
   There is, however, still more of elegance in what he says, for it is as
   though he had said: "I am in quest of a larger hire than you think of.
   I am not contented with your wealth, but I seek to have you wholly,
   that I may present a sacrifice to the Lord of the fruits of my
   ministry." But, what if one is supported by his labors? Will he in that
   case seek the worldly substance of the people. [932] Unquestionably, if
   he is a faithful Pastor, he will always seek the welfare of the sheep
   -- nothing else. His pay will, it is true, be an additional thing; but
   he ought to have no other aim, than what we have mentioned. Woe to
   those, that have an eye to any thing else!

   Parents for their children Was he then no father to the Philippians,
   who supported him even when absent from them? (Philippians 4:15, 16.)
   Was there no one of the other Apostles that was a father, inasmuch as
   the Churches ministered to their support? He did not by any means
   intend this; for it is no new thing for even parents to be supported by
   their children in their old age. Hence, those are not necessarily
   unworthy of the honor due to fathers, who live at the expense of the
   Church; but Paul simply wished to show from the common law of nature,
   that what he had done proceeded from fatherly affection. This argument,
   therefore, ought not to be turned in a contrary direction. For he did
   this as a father; but, though he had acted otherwise, he would,
   notwithstanding, have been a father still.

   15. And I will most gladly spend This, certainly, was an evidence of a
   more than fatherly affection -- that he was prepared to lay out in
   their behalf not merely his endeavors, and everything in his power to
   do, but even life itself. Nay more, while he is regarded by them with
   coldness, he continues, nevertheless, to cherish this affection. What
   heart, though even as hard as iron, would such ardor of love not soften
   or break, especially in connection with such constancy? Paul, however,
   does not here speak of himself, merely that we may admire him, but that
   we may, also, imitate him. Let all Pastors, therefore, learn from this,
   what they owe to their Churches.

   2 Corinthians 12:16-21

   16. But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I
   caught you with guile.

   16. Sed esto: ipse non gravavi vos: verum quum essem astutus, dolo vos
   cepi.

   17. Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

   17. Num per quenquam eorum, quos nisi ad vos, expilavi vos? [933]

   18. I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
   gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the
   same steps?

   18. Rogavi Titume, et una cum illo misi fratrem: num quid a vobis
   extorsit Titus? An non eodem spirtu ambulavimus? An non iisdem
   vestigiis?

   19. Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before
   God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.

   19. Rursum arbitramini, quod nos vobis excusemus? In conspectu Dei in
   christo loquimur: sed omnia, carissimi, pro vestra aedificatione.

   20. For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
   would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest
   there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings,
   swellings, tumults:

   20. Nam metuo, ne qua fiat, ut, si venero, non quales velim reperiam
   vos: et ego reperiar a vobis, qualem nolitis: ne quo modo sint
   contentiones, obtrectationes, susurri, tumores, seditiones.

   21. And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and
   that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not
   repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which
   they have committed.

   21. Ne iterum, ubi venero, humiliet me Deus meus apud vosm et lugeam
   multos eorum qui ante peccaverumt, nec poenitentiam egerunt immunditiae
   libidinis et impudicitiae quam patrarunt.


   16. But be it so. These words intimate, that Paul had been blamed by
   malevolent persons, as though he had in a clandestine way procured,
   through means of hired persons, what he had refused to receive with his
   own hands [934] -- not that he had done any such thing, but they
   "measure others," as they say, "by their own ell." [935] For it is
   customary for the wicked impudently to impute to the servants of God,
   whatever they would themselves do, if they had it in their power.
   Hence, Paul is constrained, with the view of clearing himself of a
   charge impudently fabricated, [936] to defend the integrity of those
   whom he sent, for if they had committed any error, it would have been
   reckoned to his account. Now, who would be surprised at his being so
   cautious as to alms, when he had been harassed by such unfair judgments
   as to his conduct, after having made use of every precaution? [937] Let
   his case, however, be a warning to us, not to look upon it as a thing
   that is new and intolerable, if at any time we find occasion to answer
   similar calumnies; but, more especially, let this be an admonition to
   us to use strict caution, not to furnish any handle to revilers. For we
   see, that it is not enough to give evidence of being ourselves upright,
   if those, whose assistance we have made use of, are not, also, found to
   be so. Hence, our choice of them must not be made lightly, or as a
   matter of mere form, but with the utmost possible care.

   19. Do you again think. As those that are conscious to themselves of
   something wrong are sometimes more anxious than others to clear
   themselves, it is probable, that this, also, was turned into a ground
   of calumny -- that Paul had in the former Epistle applied himself to a
   defense of his ministry. Farther, it is a fault in the servants of
   Christ, to be too much concerned as to their own reputation. With the
   view, therefore, of repelling those calumnies, he declares in the first
   place, that he speaks in the presence of God, whom evil consciences
   always dread. In the second place, he maintains, that he has not so
   much a view to himself, as to them. He was prepared to go through good
   report and bad report, (2 Corinthians 6:8,) nay, even to be reduced to
   nothing; but it was of advantage to the Corinthians, that he should
   retain the reputation that he deserved, that his ministry might not be
   brought into contempt.

   20. For I fear He declares, in what way it tends to their edification,
   that his integrity should be vindicated, for, on the ground that he had
   come into contempt, many grew wanton, as it were, with loosened reins.
   Now respect for him would have been a means of leading them to
   repentance, for they would have listened to his admonitions.

   I fear, says he. This fear proceeded from love, for, unless he had been
   concerned as to their welfare, he would very readily have overlooked
   all this, from which he sought to obtain no personal advantage. For
   otherwise we are afraid to give occasion of offense, when we foresee
   that it will be hurtful to ourselves.

   And I shall be found by you. Here is a second ground of fear -- lest he
   should be constrained to act with greater severity. Now it is a token
   not merely of love, but even of indulgence, to shun severity, and have
   recourse to milder measures. "As to my striving at present to maintain
   my authority, and endeavoring to bring you back to obedience, I do
   this, lest I should find occasion to punish your obstinacy more
   severely, if I come, and find among you nothing of amendment." He
   teaches, accordingly, by his example, that mild remedies must always be
   resorted to by Pastors, for the correction of faults, before they have
   recourse to extreme severity; and, at the same time, that we must, by
   admonitions and reproofs, prevent the necessity of having recourse to
   the utmost rigor.

   Lest, by any means, there be contentions. He enumerates the vices,
   which chiefly prevailed among the Corinthians; almost all of which
   proceeded from the same source. For had not every one been devoted to
   self, they would never have contended with each other -- they would
   never have envied one another -- there would have been no slandering
   among them. [938] Thus the sum and substance of the first catalogue
   [939] is want of love, because (philautia) self-love, [940] and
   ambition prevailed.

   21. Lest, when I come, my God should humble me His abasement was
   reckoned to him as a fault. The blame of it he throws back upon the
   Corinthians, who, when they should have honored his Apostleship, loaded
   it, on the contrary, with disgrace; for their proficiency [941] would
   have been the glory and honor of Paul's Apostleship. When, therefore,
   they were, instead of this, overrun with many vices, they heaped
   disgrace upon him to the utmost of their power. He does not, indeed,
   charge them all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently
   despised all his admonitions. The meaning, then, is this: "They think
   contemptuously of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then,
   give me no occasion of abasement: nay more, let them, on the contrary,
   laying aside their forwardness, begin to feel shame; and let them,
   confounded at their iniquities, prostrate themselves on the ground,
   instead of looking down upon others with disdain."

   In the mean time, he lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine
   Pastor, when he says that he will look upon the sins of others with
   grief. And, undoubtedly, the right way of acting is this -- that every
   Christian shall have his Church inclosed within his heart, and be
   affected with its maladies, as if they were his own, -- sympathize with
   its sorrows, and bewail its sins. We see, how Jeremiah entreats, that
   there may be given him a fountain of tears, (Jeremiah 9:1,) that he may
   bewail the calamity of his people. We see, how pious kings and
   prophets, to whom the government of the people was committed, were
   touched with similar feelings. It is, indeed, a thing that is common to
   all the pious, to be grieved in every case in which God is offended,
   and to bewail the ruin of brethren, and present themselves before God
   in their room as in a manner guilty, but it is more particularly
   requisite on the part of Pastors. [942] Farther, Paul here brings
   forward a second catalogue of vices, which, however, belong to one
   general head -- unchastity.

   you, or plunder you?"

   [934] ^"This passage is so far from being friendly to the exercise of
   guile, that it is a manifest disavowal of it. It is an irony. The
   Apostle does not describe what had actually been his conduct, but that
   of which he stood accused by the Corinthian teachers. They insinuated,
   that he was a sly, crafty man, going about preaching, persuading, and
   catching people with guile. Paul acknowledges, that he and his
   colleagues did, indeed, persuade men,' and could not do otherwise, for
   the love of Christ constrained them.' (2 Corinthians 5:11, 14.) But he
   indignantly repels the insinuation of its being from mercenary motives.
   We have wronged no man,' says he, we have corrupted no man; we have
   defrauded no man.' (2 Corinthians 7:2.) Having denied the charge, he
   shows the absurdity of it. Mercenary men, who wish to draw people after
   them, have an end to answer: and What end,' says Paul, could I have in
   view, in persuading you to embrace the gospel? Have I gained any thing
   by you? When I was with you, was I burdensome to you? No: nor, as
   things are, will I be burdensome. Yet being crafty, forsooth, I caught
   you with guile.'" -- Fuller' s Works, volume 3. -- Ed.

   [935] The reader will find the same proverb made use of by Calvin, when
   commenting on 1 Corinthians 7:36. (See [68]vol. 1, p. 265.) He probably
   alludes, in both instances, to a sentiment of Horace: "Metiri se
   quenquam suo modulo ac pede verum est;" -- "It is proper, that every
   one should measure himself by his own measure and foot." (Hor. Epist.
   1.7. 98.) -- Ed.

   [936] "Pour refuter et repousser loin de soy le blasme qu'on auoit
   controuue impudemment;" -- "With the view of repelling, and putting far
   away from himself the blame which they had inpudently contrived."

   [937] ^"Veu qu'on semoit de luy des souspectons et iugemens si iniques,
   apres qu'il auoit si diligemment pourueu a toutes choses?" -- "Inasmuch
   as they propagated such unfair surmises and judgments respecting him,
   after he had so carefully used precaution as to every thing?"

   never have slandered one another."

   [939] ^"Du premier denombrement de leur vices qu'il fait yci;" -- "Of
   the first enumeration that he makes here of their vices."

   [940] Calvin has here very probably in his eye 2 Timothy 3:2, in
   commenting on which, he calls his readers to remark, that the vice
   first noticed by the Apostle in that passage -- self-love (philautia),
   may be considered to be the fountain, as it were, of all the other
   vices there enumerated by him -- avarice, boasting, pride, etc. -- See

   CHAPTER 13
     __________________________________________________________________

   2 Corinthians 13:1-4

   1. This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or
   three witnesses shall every word be established.

   1. Hic tertius erit adventus meus ad vos. In ore duorum aut trium
   testium stabilietur omne verbum. (Deuteronomy 19:15; Matthew 18:16;
   John 8:17; Hebrews 10:28.)

   2. I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
   second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have
   sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:

   2. Praedixi et praedico, ut praesens quum essem iterum, ita et absens
   nunc scribo iis, qui ante peccaverunt, et reliquis omnibus: quod, si
   venero denuo, non parcam.

   3. Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is
   not weak, but is mighty in you.

   3. Quandoquidem esperimentum quaeritis in me loquentis Christi: qui
   erga vos non est infirmus, sed potens est in vobis.

   4. For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the
   power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him
   by the power of God toward you.

   4. Nam quamvis crucifixus fuit ex infirmitate, vivit tamen ex virtute
   Dei: siquidem et nos infirmi sumus in illo, sed vivmus cum illo ex
   virtute Dei erga vos.


   1. This will be the third. He goes on to reprove still farther the
   insolence of those of whom he had been speaking, some of whom living in
   profligacy and licentiousness, and others, carrying on contentions and
   strifes among themselves, cared nothing for his reproof. For his
   discourse did not apply to the entire body of the Church, but to
   certain diseased and half-rotten members of it. Hence he now, with
   greater freedom, uses sharpness, because he has to do with particular
   individuals, not with the whole body of the people, and besides this,
   it was with persons of such a stamp, that he perceived, that he would
   do them no good by kindness, and mild remedies. After having spent a
   year and a half among them, (Acts 18:11,) he had visited them a second
   time. Now he forewarns them, that he will come to them a third time,
   and he says, that his three comings to them will be in the place of
   three witnesses. He quotes the law as to the authority of witnesses;
   not in the natural and literal sense, as it is termed, but by
   accommodation, [943] or similitude, applying it to his particular
   purpose.

   "The declaration of the law," says he, "is, that we must rest on the
   testimony of two or three witnesses for putting an end to disputes."
   [944] (Deuteronomy 19:15.)

   For the word established means that a decision is pronounced respecting
   a matter, that the strife may cease. "I, indeed, am but one individual,
   but coming a third time I shall have the authority of three witnesses,
   or, my three comings will be in the place of three testimonies." For
   the threefold effort that was made for their welfare, and perseverance,
   as made trial of on three different occasions, might, with good reason,
   be held equivalent to three persons.

   2. I told you before, and foretell you. The friendly and agreeable
   admonitions, that he had addressed to them so frequently, had been of
   no advantage. He, accordingly, betakes himself to a more severe remedy,
   with which he had previously threatened them in words when present with
   them. When we see him act with so much strictness, we need have no
   doubt, that they were surprisingly ungovernable and obstinate; for it
   appears from his writings, what mildness, and what unwearied patience
   he was otherwise prepared to manifest. As, however, it is the part of a
   good parent to forgive and bear with many things, so it is the part of
   a foolish parent, and one that has no proper regard for the welfare of
   his children, to neglect to use severity, when there is occasion for
   it, and to mingle strictness with mildness. We are well aware, that
   nothing is more hurtful than excessive indulgence [945] Let us,
   therefore, use mildness, when we can safely do so, and that too,
   dignified and properly regulated: let us act with greater severity,
   when necessity requires.

   It is asked, however, why it was, that the Apostle allowed himself to
   expose the particular faults of individuals in so open a manner, as in
   a manner to point his finger at the very persons? I answer, that he
   would never have done so, if the sins had been hid, but as they were
   manifest to all, and matter of notoriety, so as to furnish a pernicious
   example, it was necessary that he should not spare the authors of a
   public scandal. [946]

   It is asked, secondly, what kind of chastisement he threatens to
   inflict upon them, as he could scarcely chastise them more severely in
   words. I have no doubt that he means, that he will inflict punishment
   upon them by excommunication. For what is more to be dreaded, than
   being cut off from the body of Christ, expelled from the kingdom of
   God, and delivered over to Satan for destruction, (1 Corinthians 5:5,)
   unless you repent?

   3. Since ye seek a proof A twofold meaning may be drawn from these
   words. The first is, "Since you wish to try me, whether I speak of
   myself, or whether Christ speaks by me;" and in this way Chrysostom,
   and Ambrose, explain it. I am rather inclined, however, to understand
   him as declaring, that it does not so much concern himself as Christ,
   when his authority is detracted from -- that when his admonitions are
   despised, Christ's patience is tried. "It is Christ that speaks by me;
   when therefore, you bring my doctrine under your lash, it is not so
   much to me as to him that you do injury."

   Some one, however, will object thus: "What! Will a man's doctrine,
   then, be exempted from all investigation, so soon as he makes it his
   boast, that he has Christ as his authority? And what false prophet will
   not make this his boast? What distinction, then, will there be between
   truth and falsehood, and what will, in that case, become of that
   injunction:

   Try the spirits, whether they are of God." (1 John 4:1.)

   Every objection of this nature Paul anticipates, when he says that
   Christ has wrought efficaciously in them by his ministry. For these two
   clauses, Christ speaking in me, and, who is mighty in you, not weak,
   must be read in connection, in this sense: "Christ, by exercising his
   power towards you in my doctrine, has declared that he spoke by my
   mouth, so that you have no excuse on the ground of ignorance."

   We see, that he does not merely boast in words, but proves in reality
   that Christ speaks in him, and he convinces the Corinthians, before
   requiring them to give him credit. Whoever, then, will speak in the
   Church, whatever be the title that he claims for himself, it will be
   allowable to inquire as to his doctrine, until Christ has manifested
   himself in him, and thus it will not be of Christ that judgment will be
   formed, but of the man. When, however, it is apparent, that it is the
   word of God that is advanced, what Paul says holds good -- that it is
   God himself who is not believed [947] Moses spake with the same
   confidence. (Numbers 16:11.)

   What are we -- I and Aaron? You are tempting God.

   In like manner, Isaiah:

   Is it too small a thing that you grieve men,
   unless you grieve my God also? (Isaiah 7:13.)

   For there is no more room for shuffling, when it has been made
   apparent, that it is a minister of God that speaks, and that he
   discharges his office faithfully. I return to Paul. As the confirmation
   of his ministry had been so decided among the Corinthians, inasmuch as
   the Lord had shown himself openly, it is not to be wondered, if he
   takes it so much amiss, that he meets with resistance. On good grounds,
   truly, [948] might he throw back upon them, as he does, the reproach,
   that they were rebels against Christ.

   4. For though he was crucified. He speaks, with particular intention,
   of Christ's abasement, with the view of intimating indirectly, [949]
   that nothing was despised in him, but what they would have been
   prepared to despise, also, in Christ himself, inasmuch as he

   emptied himself, even to the death of the cross.
   (Philippians 2:8.)

   He shows, however, at the same time, how absurd it is to despise in
   Christ [950] the abasement of the cross, inasmuch as it is conjoined
   with the incomparable glory of his resurrection. "Shall Christ be
   esteemed by you the less, because he showed signs of weakness in his
   death, as if his heavenly life, that he leads subsequently to his
   resurrection, were not a clear token of his Divine power?" For as the
   term flesh here means Christ's human nature, [951] so the word God is
   taken here to denote his Divinity.

   Here, however, a question arises -- whether Christ labored under such
   infirmity as to be subjected to necessity against his will; for, what
   we suffer through weakness, we suffer from constraint, and not from our
   own choice. As the Arians of old abused this pretext for effectually
   opposing the divinity of Christ, the orthodox Fathers gave this
   explanation of it -- that it was effected by appointment, inasmuch as
   Christ so desired, and not from his being constrained by any necessity.
   This answer is true, provided it be properly understood. There are
   some, however, that mistakenly extend the appointment to Christ's human
   will -- as if this were not the condition of his nature, but a
   permission contrary to his nature. For example: "His dying," they say,
   "did not happen because his humanity was, properly speaking, liable to
   death, but by appointment, because he chose to die." I grant, indeed,
   that he died, because he chose to do so; but, whence came this choice,
   but from this -- that he had, of his own accord, clothed himself with a
   mortal nature [952] If, however, we make Christ's human nature so
   unlike ours, the main support of our faith is overturned. Let us,
   therefore, understand it in this way -- that Christ suffered by
   appointment, not by constraint, because, being in the form of God he
   could have exempted himself from this necessity, but, nevertheless, he
   suffered through weakness, because he emptied himself (Philippians
   2:6.)

   We are weak in him. To be weak in Christ means here to be a partaker of
   Christ's weakness. Thus he makes his own weakness glorious, because in
   it he is conformed to Christ, and he no longer shrinks back from the
   disgrace, that he has in common with the Son of God; but, in the mean
   time, he says that he will live towards them after Christ's example. "I
   also," says he, "will be a partaker of Christ's life, after I shall
   have been exempted from weakness." [953] To weakness he opposes life,
   and, accordingly, he understands by this term a condition that is
   flourishing, and full of honor. [954] The clause towards you may also
   be taken in connection with the power of God, but it is of no
   importance, as the meaning always remains the same -- that the
   Corinthians, when they began to judge aright, would have respectful and
   honorable views of the power of God, which was in Paul, and would no
   longer despise outward infirmity.

   animadverting so freely on the faults of the ministers of religion in

   plainly and sharply against the sins of the ministry, or that I should
   not have published it to the view of the world, or, at least, that I
   should have done it in another tongue, and not in the ears of the
   vulgar. When the sin is open in the sight of the world, it is in vain
   to attempt to hide it; and when the sin is public, the confession
   should also be public. If the ministers of England had sinned only in
   Latin, I would have made shift to have admonished them in Latin, or

   2 Corinthians 13:5-9

   5. Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
   selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you,
   except ye be reprobates?

   5. Vosmet iposo tentate, num sitis in fide: vos ipsos probate. Annon
   cognoscitis vosmet ipsos, quod Iesus Christus in vobis est, nisi si
   cubi reprobi estis?

   6. But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

   6. At spero vos cognituros, quod nos non simus reprobi.

   7. Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
   approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as
   reprobates.

   7. Opto autem apud Deum, ne quid male faciatis; non quo nos probati
   appareamus, sed ut vos quod honestum est faciatis, nos vero veluti
   reprobi sumus.

   8. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

   8. Non enim possumus quicquam adversus veritatem, sed pro veritate.

   9. For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also
   we wish, even your perfection.

   9. Gaudemus enim, quum nos infirmi fuerimus, vos autem validi fueritis:
   hoc vero etiam optamus, vestram integritatem.


   5. Try yourselves. He confirms, what he had stated previously -- that
   Christ's power showed itself openly in his ministry. For he makes them
   the judges of this matter, provided they descend, as it were, into
   themselves, and acknowledge what they had received from him. In the
   first place, as there is but one Christ, it must be of necessity, that
   the same Christ must dwell alike in minister and people. Now, dwelling
   in the people, how will he deny himself in the minister. [955] Farther,
   he had shown his power in Paul's preaching, in such a manner that it
   could be no longer doubtful or obscure to the Corinthians, if they were
   not altogether stupid. [956] For, whence had they faith? whence had
   they Christ? whence, in fine, had they every thing? It is with good
   reason, therefore, that they are called to look into themselves, that
   they may discover there, what they despise as a thing unknown. Then
   only has a minister a true and well grounded assurance for the
   approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the consciences of
   those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of Christ, and
   of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his fidelity.
   We are now in possession of Paul's object.

   This passage, however, is deserving of particular observation on two
   accounts. For, in the first place, it shows the relation, [957] which
   subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the
   minister -- that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth,
   and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin.
   [958] In the second place, it serves to prove the assurance of faith,
   as to which the Sorbonnic sophists have made us stagger, nay more, have
   altogether rooted out from the minds of men. They charge with rashness
   all that are persuaded that they are the members of Christ, and have
   Him remaining in them, for they bid us be satisfied with a "moral
   conjecture," [959] as they call it -- that is, with a mere opinion
   [960] so that our consciences remain constantly in suspense, and in a
   state of perplexity. But what does Paul say here? He declares, that all
   are reprobates, who doubt whether they profess Christ and are a part of
   His body. Let us, therefore, reckon that alone to be right faith, which
   leads us to repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering
   opinion, but with a firm and steadfast assurance.

   Unless by any means you are reprobates. He gives them in a manner their
   choice, whether they would rather be reprobates, than give due
   testimony to his ministry; for he leaves them no alternative, but
   either to show respect to his Apostleship, or to allow that they are
   reprobates. For, unquestionably, their faith had been founded upon his
   doctrine, and they had no other Christ, than they had received from
   him, and no other gospel than what they had embraced, as delivered to
   them by him, so that it were vain for them to attempt to separate any
   part of their salvation from his praise.

   6. I hope that you shall know He presses them still more urgently,
   while indulging this confident persuasion -- that he will not be
   rejected by the Corinthians. One of two things was necessary -- that
   they should either assign to Paul the honor due to an Apostle, or
   condemn themselves for unbelief, and acknowledge that they have no
   Church. He softens, however, the severity of the statement, by making
   use of the expression -- I hope; but in such a manner as to remind them
   the better of their duty; for to disappoint the hopes that have been
   entertained as to our integrity, is excessively cruel. "I hope," says
   he, "that you shall know -- when you have been restored to a sound
   mind." He prudently, however, says nothing as to himself in this second
   clause, calling them to consider God's benefits, by which they had been
   distinguished; nay more, he puts their salvation in the place of his
   authority.

   7. I desire before God. Again he declares, that he cares nothing for
   his own honor, but is simply desirous of promoting their advantage. For
   nothing was so undesirable for them, as to deprive themselves of
   advantage from his doctrine -- as they had begun to do, through their
   pride and contempt. "As to myself," says he, "for my reputation among
   men, I am not concerned. My only fear is, lest you should offend God.
   Nay more, I am prepared to be as a reprobate, provided you are free
   from all blame." "I am a reprobate," says he, "in the judgment of
   mankind, who very frequently reject those who are deserving of the
   highest honor." [961] At the same time, the particle as is not
   superfluous. For it corresponds with what he says elsewhere -- as
   deceivers and yet true. (2 Corinthians 6:8.) And this, certainly, is
   the true rule -- that the Pastor, having no regard to himself, should
   be devoted exclusively to the edification of the Church. Let him be
   concerned as to his own reputation, in so far as he sees it to be
   conducive to the public advantage. Let him be prepared to feel
   indifferent to it, whenever he may do so, without public disadvantage.

   8. For we can do nothing: That is -- "I do not seek, or desire any
   other power, than what the Lord has conferred upon me, that I may
   promote the truth. To false Apostles it is all one, provided they have
   power; and they feel no concern to make use of their power for the
   promotion of what is good." In short, he defends and maintains the
   honor of his ministry, in so far as it is connected with the truth of
   God. "What does it matter to me? For unless I have in view to promote
   the truth, all the power that I shall claim will be false and
   groundless. If, however, I lay out, whatever I have, for the promotion
   of the truth, I, in that case, do not consult my own interest. Now,
   when the authority of doctrine is safe, and truth is uninjured, I have
   what I desire. In contending, therefore, so keenly, I am not influenced
   by any exclusive regard for myself personally." By this consideration,
   however, he intimates, that the man, who fights and labors for the
   truth alone will not take it amiss, should occasion require it, to be
   regarded in the judgment of men as a reprobate, provided this does not
   interfere with the glory of God, the edification of the Church, and the
   authority of sound doctrine.

   This passage must be carefully observed, because it limits the power,
   which the Pastors of the Church should have, and fixes its proper
   bounds -- that they be ministers of the truth. Papists loudly tell us,
   that it is said,

   He that heareth you, heareth me;
   he that despiseth you, despiseth me, (Luke 10:16);

   and likewise:

   Obey them that are set over you, (Hebrews 13:17);

   and under this pretext they take to themselves the utmost liberty, so
   as to usurp unbounded dominion, while they are, at the same time, the
   avowed and sworn enemies of the truth, and aim at its destruction by
   every means in their power. For exposing such impudence, this one
   statement of Paul will suffice -- which declares, that they must
   themselves be in subjection to the truth. [962]

   9. For, we rejoice. Either the causal particle gar, (for,) must be
   taken as meaning -- therefore; or it is a second reason, why he does
   not refuse to be regarded as a reprobate -- for their sake, and with a
   view to their advantage. Let the reader select whichever he may choose,
   for it is of no consequence. [963] When he says, Provided you are
   strong, I shall willingly submit to be reckoned weak, there is an
   antithesis in the words -- not in the meaning; for weakness means here,
   as formerly, (2 Corinthians 13:4,) contempt. On the other hand, he
   means that the Corinthians will be strong, if they are full of the
   power and grace of God.

   And this also, He now again repeats, what he had already stated several
   times, that he was from necessity -- not from his own inclination, more
   severe than they would have wished; and farther, that by this means,
   too, [964] he spared them, that he might not be constrained to resort
   to severer measures, when he was present with them.

   The perfection, of which he speaks, consists in a fit proportion, and
   sound condition, of all the members. Now [965] he alludes to good
   physicians, who cure particular diseases in such a way as not in any
   part to mutilate the body; [966] and, as he is concerned to secure a
   perfection of this nature, he says, that, for that reason, he provides
   against the necessity of having recourse to severer measures. [967] For
   we see, that those, who at first shrink back from the slight pain, or
   uneasy feeling of a plaster, are at length constrained to endure the
   torture of burning, or amputating, and that, too, where the issue is
   extremely doubtful. [968]

   speaketh expressly and onely of faith, the act whereof a man may know
   and feele to be in himself, because it is an act of understanding,
   though he cannot be assured that he hath his sinnes remitted, and that
   he is in all pointes in a state of grace and salvation; because euery

   csse consilium ut Corinthiacae Ecolesiae membris, quae luxata fuerant,
   rursus in locum suum veluti repositis, totum illud corpus mutuo
   connexis membris instauretur, Galatians 6, 1. Itaque licebat etiam
   reconcinnationem interpretari;" -- "For the meaning of the word
   katartizein is various and manifold. On comparing, however, this verse
   with a subsequent one, I am of opinion that Paul by this term simply
   means, that it was his design, that those members of the Corinthian
   Church which had been dislocated, as it were, having been restored to
   their proper place, the entire body should be renovated by the members
   being mutually connected together, (as in Galatians 6:1.) Hence we
   might even render the term -- readjustment." See Calvin on the

   2 Corinthians 13:10-14

   10. Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I
   should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given
   me to edification, and not to destruction.

   10. Propterea haec absens scribo: ne quum praesens fuero, rigidus sim
   iuxta potestatem, quam dedit mihi Dominus in aedificationem, et non in
   destructionem.

   11. Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of
   one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with
   you.

   11. Quod superest, fratres, valete, integri estote, [969] consolationem
   habete, unanimes sitis, in pace agite: et Deus caritatis ac pacis erit
   vobiscum.

   12. Greet one another with an holy kiss.

   12. Salutate vos mutuo in osculo sancto.

   13. All the saints salute you.

   13. Salutant vos sacti omnes.

   14. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
   communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

   14. Gratia Domini Iesu Christi, et caritas Dei, et communicatio
   Spiritus sancti sit cum omnibus vobis. Amen.

   The second epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi, a city
   of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.

   Ad Corinthios secumda missa fuit a Philippis Macedoniae -- per Titum et
   Lucam.


   10. According to the power In the first place, he arms the strictness
   of which he speaks, with the authority of God, that it may not appear
   to be thunder without lightning, or a rashly excited onset. [970]
   Farther, he lets them know, that he would rather employ his power to
   another purpose, for which it was peculiarly designed -- the promoting
   of their edification. "I shall not rashly have recourse to cruel
   remedies, nor will I give indulgence to my passion, but will simply
   execute the commission that the Lord has given me."

   When he speaks of power given him for edification, and not for
   destruction, he employs these terms for a somewhat different purpose
   from what he had done previously in 2 Corinthians 10:8. For in that
   passage there was a commendation of the Gospel from the advantage it
   yields -- because what is for our advantage is wont to be agreeable,
   and is willingly received by us. Here, however, he simply means to
   declare, that although he might justly inflict upon the Corinthians a
   severe blow, yet it was much more his inclination to exercise his power
   for their advantage, than for their destruction -- the former being its
   proper design. For as the Gospel, in its own nature, is the power of
   God unto salvation, (Romans 1:16,) and an odor of life unto life, (2
   Corinthians 2:15, 16,) but in a way of contingency, is an odor of
   death; so the authority, which is conferred upon the Ministers of it,
   ought to be salutary to the hearers. If, on the other hand, it turns
   out to their condemnation, that is contrary to its nature. The meaning,
   therefore, is this: "Do not, through your own fault, allow that to turn
   to your destruction, which God has appointed for salvation." In the
   mean time, the Apostle admonishes all pastors by his example, in what
   manner they should limit the use of their power.

   11. Finally, brethren He qualifies whatever there has been of sharpness
   throughout the whole of the epistle, as he did not wish to leave their
   minds in an exasperated state, [971] but rather to soothe them. For
   then only are reproofs beneficial, when they are in a manner seasoned
   with honey, that the hearer may, if possible, receive them in an
   agreeable spirit. At the same time, he appears to turn from a few
   diseased persons [972] to the entire Church. Hence he declares, that he
   aims at promoting its perfection, and desires its consolation.

   To be of one mind, and to live in peace, are expressions which mean two
   different things; for the one takes its rise from the other. The former
   relates to agreement of sentiment; the latter denotes benevolence, and
   union of hearts.

   And the God of peace This he adds, that his exhortation may have more
   weight with them, but, at the same time, he intimates that God will be
   with us, if we cultivate peace among ourselves; but that those that are
   at variance with each other are at a distance from him. [973] For where
   there are strifes and contentions, there, it is certain, the devil
   reigns.

   Now what agreement is there between light and darkness?
   (2 Corinthians 6.14.)

   He calls him the God of peace and love, because he has recommended to
   us peace and love, because he loves them, and is the author of them. Of
   the kiss here mentioned we have spoken in the two preceding Epistles.

   14. The grace of the Lord Jesus. He closes the Epistle with a prayer,
   which contains three clauses, in which the sum of our salvation
   consists. In the first place, he desires for them the grace of Christ;
   secondly, the love of God; and, thirdly, the communion of the Spirit
   The term grace does not here mean unmerited favor, but is taken by
   metonymy, to denote the whole benefit of redemption. The order,
   however, may appear to be here inverted, because the love of God is
   placed second, while it is the source of that grace, and hence it is
   first in order. I answer, that the arrangement of terms in the
   Scriptures is not always so very exact; but, at the same time, this
   order, too, corresponds with the common form of doctrine, which is
   contained in the Scriptures -- that

   when we were enemies to God,
   we were reconciled by the death of his Son, (Romans 5:10,)

   though the Scripture is wont to speak of this in two ways. For it
   sometimes declares what I have quoted from Paul -- that there was
   enmity between us and God, before we were reconciled through Christ. On
   the other hand, we hear what John says -- that

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, etc. (John
   3:16.)

   The statements are apparently opposite; but it is easy to reconcile
   them; because in the one case we look to God, and in the other to
   ourselves. For God, viewed in himself, loved us before the creation of
   the world, and redeemed us for no other reason than this -- because he
   loved us. As for us, on the other hand, as we see in ourselves nothing
   but occasion of wrath, that is, sin, we cannot apprehend any love of
   God towards us without a Mediator. Hence it is that, with respect to
   us, the beginning of love is from the grace of Christ. According to the
   former view of the matter, Paul would have expressed himself
   improperly, had he put the love of God before the grace of Christ, or,
   in other words, the cause before the effect; but according to the
   latter, it were a suitable arrangement to begin with the grace of
   Christ, which was the procuring cause of God's adopting us into the
   number of his sons, and honoring us with his love, whom previously he
   regarded with hatred and abhorrence on account of sin.

   The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is added, because it is only under
   his guidance, that we come to possess Christ, and all his benefits. He
   seems, however, at the same time, to allude to the diversity of gifts,
   of which he had made mention elsewhere, (2 Corinthians 12:11;) because
   God does not give the Spirit to every one in a detached way, but
   distributes to each according to the measure of grace, that the members
   of the Church, by mutually participating, one with another, may cherish
   unity.
