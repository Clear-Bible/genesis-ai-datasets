The Works of Guy De Maupassant

   It was, I think, in the year 1881 that Turgenev, during a visit at my
   house, took a French novel, under the name of Maison Tellier, out of
   his satchel and gave it to me.

   "Read it, if you have a chance," he said, apparently with indifference,
   just as the year before he had handed me a number of the Russian
   Wealth, in which there was an article by Garshin, who was making his
   debut. Evidently, as in the case of Garshin, so even now, he was afraid
   he might influence me in one way or another, and wished to know my
   uninfluenced opinion.

   "He is a young French author," he said; "look at it, -- it is not bad;
   he knows you and esteems you very much," he added, as though to
   encourage me. "As a man he reminds me of Druzhinin. He is just as
   excellent a son and friend, un homme d'un commerce sur, as was
   Druzhinin, and, besides, he has relations with the labouring people,
   whom he guides and aids. Even in his relations to women he reminds me
   of Druzhinin."

   And Turgenev told me something remarkable and incredible in regard to
   Maupassant's relations in this respect.

   This time, the year 1881, was for me the most ardent time of the inner
   reconstruction of my whole world-conception, and in this reconstruction
   the activity which is called artistic, and to which I formerly used to
   devote all my strength, not only lost for me the significance formerly
   ascribed to it, but even became distinctly distasteful to me on account
   of the improper place which it had occupied in my life and which in
   general it occupies in the concepts of the men of the wealthy classes.

   For this reason I was at that time not in the least interested in such
   productions as the one which Turgenev recommended to me. But, to oblige
   him, I read the book which he gave me.

   Judging from the first story, Maison Tellier, I could not help but see,
   in spite of the indecent and insignificant subject of the story, that
   the author possessed what is called talent.

   The author was endowed with that particular gift, called talent, which
   consists in the author's ability to direct, according to his tastes,
   his intensified, strained attention to this or that subject, in
   consequence of which the author who is endowed with this ability sees
   in those subjects upon which he directs his attention, something new,
   something which others did not see. Maupassant evidently possessed that
   gift of seeing in subjects something which others did not see. But, to
   judge from the small volume which I had read, he was devoid of the
   chief condition necessary, besides talent, for a truly artistic
   production. Of the three conditions: (1) a correct, that is, a moral
   relation of the author to the subject, (2) the clearness of exposition,
   or the beauty of form, which is the same, and (3) sincerity, that is,
   an undisguised feeling of love or hatred for what the artist describes,
   -- Maupassant possessed only the last two, and was entirely devoid of
   the first. He had no correct, that is, no moral relation to the
   subjects described. From what I had read, I was convinced that
   Maupassant possessed talent, that is, the gift of attention, which in
   the objects and phenomena of life revealed to him those qualities which
   are not visible to other men; he also possessed a beautiful form, that
   is, he expressed clearly, simply, and beautifully what he wished to
   say, and also possessed that condition of the worth of an artistic
   production, without which it does not produce any effect, -- sincerity,
   -- that is, he did not simulate love or hatred, but actually loved and
   hated what he described. But unfortunately, being devoid of the first,
   almost the most important condition of the worth of an artistic
   production, of the correct, moral relation to what he represented, that
   is, of the knowledge of the difference between good and evil, he loved
   and represented what it was not right to love and represent, and did
   not love and did not represent what he ought to have loved and
   represented. Thus the author in this little volume describes with much
   detail and love how women tempt men and men tempt women, and even some
   incomprehensible obscenities, which are represented in La Femme de
   Paul, and he describes the labouring country people, not only with
   indifference, but even with contempt, as so many animals.

   Particularly striking was that lack of distinction between bad and good
   in the story Une Partie de Campagne, in which, in the form of a most
   clever and amusing jest, he gives a detailed account of how two
   gentlemen with bared arms, rowing in a boat, simultaneously tempted,
   the one an old mother, and the other a young maiden, her daughter.

   The author's sympathy is during the whole time obviously to such an
   extent on the side of the two rascals, that he ignores, or, rather,
   does not see what the tempted mother, the girl, the father, and the
   young man, evidently the fiance of the daughter, must have suffered,
   and so we not only get a shocking description of a disgusting crime in
   the form of an amusing jest, but the event itself is described falsely,
   because only the most insignificant side of the subject, the pleasure
   afforded to the rascals, is described.

   In the same volume there is a story, Histoire d'une Fille de Ferme,
   which Turgenev recommended to me more particularly, and which more
   particularly displeased me on account of the author's incorrect
   relation to the subject. The author apparently sees in all the working
   people whom he describes nothing but animals, who do not rise above
   sexual and maternal love, and so the description leaves us with an
   incomplete, artificial impression.

   The insufficient comprehension of the lives and interests of the
   working classes, and the representation of the men from those classes
   in the form of half-animals, which are moved only by sensuality,
   malice, and greed, forms one of the chief and most important defects of
   the majority of the modern French authors, among them Maupassant, not
   only in this story, but also in all the other stories, in which he
   touches on the people and always describes them as coarse, dull
   animals, whom one can only ridicule. Of course, the French authors must
   know the conditions of their people better than I know them; but,
   although I am a Russian and have not lived with the French people, I
   non the less assert that, in describing their masses, the French
   authors are wrong, and that the French masses cannot be as they are
   described. If there exists a France as we know it, with her truly great
   men and with those great contributions which these great men have made
   to science, art, civil polity, and the moral perfection of humanity,
   those labouring masses, which have held upon their shoulders this
   France and her great men, do not consist of animals, but of men with
   great spiritual qualities; and so I do not believe what I am told in
   novels like La Terre, and in Maupassant's stories, just as I should not
   believe if I were told of the existence of a beautiful house standing
   on no foundation. It is very possible that the high qualities of the
   masses are not such as are described in La petit Fadette and in La Mare
   au Diable, but these qualities exist, that I know for certain, and the
   writer who describes the masses, as Maupassant does, by telling
   sympathetically of the "hanches" and "gorges" of Breton domestics, and
   with contempt and ridicule the life of the labouring people, commits a
   great error in an artistic sense, because he describes the subject from
   only one, the most uninteresting, physical side, and completely
   overlooks the other, the most important, spiritual side, which forms
   the essence of the subject.

   In general, the reading of the volume which Turgenev gave me left me
   completely indifferent to the young writer.

   I was at that time so disgusted with the stories, Une Partie de
   Campagne, La Femme de Paul, and L'Histoire d'une Fille de Ferme, that I
   did not at that time notice the beautiful story, Le Papa de Simon, and
   the superb story, so far as the description of a night is concerned,
   Sur l'Eau.

   "There are in our time, when there are so many who are willing to
   write, a number of people with talent, who do not know to what to apply
   it, or who boldly apply it to what ought not and should not be
   described," I thought. I told Turgenev so. And I entirely forgot about
   Maupassant.

   The first thing from Maupassant's writings which after that fell into
   my hands was Une Vie, which somebody advised me to read. This book at
   once made me change my opinion concerning Maupassant, and after that I
   read with interest everything which was written over his name. Une Vie
   is an excellent novel, not only incomparably the best novel by
   Maupassant, but almost the best French novel since Hugo's Les
   Miserables. Besides the remarkable power of his talent, that is, of
   that peculiar, strained attention, directed upon an object, in
   consequence of which the author sees entirely new features in the life
   which he is describing, this novel combines, almost to an equal degree,
   all three conditions of a true artistic production: (1) the correct,
   that is, the moral, relation of the author to the subject, (2) the
   beauty of form, and (3) sincerity, that is, love for what the author
   describes. Here the meaning of life no longer presents itself to the
   author in the experiences of all kinds of debauched persons, -- here
   the contents, as the title says, are formed by the description of a
   ruined, innocent, sweet woman, who is prepared for anything beautiful,
   a woman who is ruined by that very gross, animal sensuality which in
   the former stories presented itself to the author as the central
   phenomenon of life, which dominates everything, and the author's whole
   sympathy is on the side of the good.

   The form, which is beautiful even in the first stories, is here carried
   to a high degree of perfection, such as, in my opinion, has not been
   reached by any other French prose writer. And, besides, what is most
   important, the author here really loves, and loves strongly, the good
   family which he describes, and actually despises that coarse male who
   destroys the happiness and peace of this dear family and especially of
   the heroine of the novel.

   It is for that reason that all the events and persons of this novel are
   so vivid and impress themselves on our memory: the weak, good,
   slatternly mother; the noble, weak, dear father, and the daughter, who
   is still dearer in her simplicity, absence of exaggeration, and
   readiness for everything good; their mutual relations, their first
   journey, their servants, their neighbours, the calculating, coarsely
   sensuous, stingy, petty impudent fiance, who, as always, deceives the
   innocent girl with the customary base idealization of the grossest of
   sentiments; the marriage; Corsica, with the charming descriptions of
   nature; then the life in the country; the coarse deception of the
   husband; the seizure of the power over the estate; his conflicts with
   his father-in-law; the yielding of the good people; the victory of
   impudence,; the relation to the neighbours, -- all that is life itself,
   with all its complexity and variety. But not only is all this described
   vividly and well, -- there is over all a sincere, pathetic tone, which
   involuntarily affects the reader. One feels that the author loves this
   woman, and that he does not love her mainly for her external forms, but
   for her soul, for what there is good in it, and that he sympathizes
   with her and suffers for her, and this sensation is involuntarily
   transferred to the reader. And the questions as to why, for what
   purpose this fair creature was ruined, and why it should be so,
   naturally arise in the reader's soul, and make him stop and reflect on
   the meaning and significance of human life.

   In spite of the false notes, which here and there occur in the novel,
   as, for example, the detailed account of the girl's skin, or the
   impossible and unnecessary details about how the deserted wife, by the
   advice of the abbot, again becomes a mother, details which destroy all
   the charm of the heroine's purity; in spite of the melodramatic and
   unnatural history of the revenge of the insulted husband, -- in spite
   of these blemishes, the novel not only appears to me to be beautiful,
   but through it I no longer saw in the author the talented babbler and
   jester, who does not know and does not want to know what is good and
   what bad, such as he had appeared to me to be, judging him from the
   first book, but a serious man, who looks deeply into a man's life and
   is beginning to make things out in it.

   The next novel of Maupassant which I read was Bel-Ami.

   Bel-Ami is a very filthy book. The author apparently gives himself the
   reins in the description of what attracts him, and at times seems to be
   losing the fundamental, negative point of view upon his hero and passes
   over to his side; but in general, Bel-Ami, like Une Vie, has for its
   basis a serious thought and sentiment.

   In Une Vie the fundamental thought is the perplexity in the presence of
   the cruel senselessness of the agonizing life of a beautiful woman, who
   is ruined by the gross sensuality of a man; here it is not only the
   perplexity, but also the indignation of the author at the sight of the
   welfare and success of a gross sensuous beast, who by his very
   sensuality makes a career for himself and attains a high position in
   the world, an indignation also at the sight of the corruption of that
   milieu in which the hero attains his success. There the author seems to
   ask: "Why, for what purpose, is the fair creature ruined? Why did it
   happen?" Here he seems to be answering the questions: "Everything pure
   and good has perished and continues to perish in our society, because
   this society is corrupt, senseless, and terrible."

   The last scene of the novel, the marriage in a fashionable church of
   the triumphant rascal, who is adorned with the Order of the Legion of
   Honour, with the pure young maiden, the daughter of the old, formerly
   irreproachable mother of the family, whom he seduced, the marriage,
   which is blessed by the bishop and is recognized as something good and
   proper by all the persons present, expresses this idea with unusual
   force. In this novel, in spite of its being clogged with obscene
   details, in which the author unfortunately seems to delight, we can see
   the same serious relations of the author to life.

   Read the conversation of the old poet with Duroy, when they come out
   after dinner from the Walters, I think. The old poet lays bare life
   before his young interlocutor and shows it to him such as it is, with
   its eternal, unavoidable companion and end, -- death.

   "It already holds me, la gueuse," he says of death. "It has already
   loosened by teeth, pulled out my hair, mauled my limbs, and is about to
   swallow me. I am already in its power, -- it only plays with me, as a
   cat plays with a mouse, knowing that I cannot get away from it. Glory,
   wealth, -- what is it all good for, since it is not possible to buy a
   woman's love with them, and it is only a woman's love that makes life
   worth living. And death will take that away. It will take this first,
   and then health, strength, and life itself. And it is the same with
   everybody. And that is all."

   Such is the meaning of the remarks of the aging poet. But Duroy, the
   fortunate lover of all those women whom he likes, is so full of
   sensuous energy and strength that he hears, and yet does not hear, and
   understands, and yet does not understand, the words of the old poet. He
   hears and understands, but the spring of his sensuous life bubbles up
   with such force that the incontestable truth, which promises the same
   end to him, does not appall him.

   It is this inner contradiction which, besides its satirical
   significance, forms the chief meaning of Bel-Ami. The same thought
   sparkles in the beautiful scenes of the death of the consumptive
   journalist. The author puts the question to himself as to what life is
   and how the contradiction between the love of life and the knowledge of
   unavoidable death is to be solved, -- and he does not answer the
   questions. He seems to be seeking and waiting, and does not decide one
   way or another. Consequently the moral relation to life continues to be
   correct in this novel also.

   But in the next novels after that this moral relation to life begins to
   become entangled, the valuation of the phenomena of life begins to
   waver, to grow dim, and in the last novels is completely distorted.

   In Mont-Oriol Maupassant seems to combine the motives of the two
   preceding novels, and repeats himself as regards contents. In spite of
   the beautiful descriptions, full of refined humour, of a fashionable
   watering-place and of the activity of the doctors in this place, we
   have here the same male, Paul, who is just as base and heartless and
   the husband in Une Vie, and the same deceived, ruined, yielding, weak,
   lonely, always lonely, dear woman, and the same indifferent triumph of
   insignificance and baseness as in Bel-Ami.

   The thought is the same, but the author's relation to what he describes
   is now considerably lower, especially lower than in the first novel.
   The inner valuation of the author as to what is good and bad begins to
   become entangled. In spite of all the mental desire of the author to be
   objective without any bias, the rascal Paul apparently enjoys the
   author's complete sympathy. For this reason the history of Paul's love,
   his attempts to seduce, and his success in this produce a false
   impression. The reader does not know what the author wants, -- whether
   he wants to show the whole emptiness and baseness of Paul, who with
   indifference turns away from the woman and offends her, only because
   her form is spoiled from being pregnant with a child by him, or whether
   he wants, on the contrary, to show how agreeable and nice it is to live
   the way this Paul lives.

   In the next novels after that, Pierre et Jean, Fort comme la Mort, and
   Notre Coeur, the moral relation of the author to his persons is still
   more entangled, and is entirely lost in the last. On all these novels
   already lies the stamp of indifference, haste, fictiousness, and, above
   all, again that absence of a correct moral relation to life which was
   noticeable in his first writings. This begins at the same time that
   Maupassant's reputation as a fashionable author becomes established,
   and he is subject to that terrible temptation to which every well-known
   author, particularly such an attractive one as Maupassant, falls a
   prey. On the one side, the success of the first novels, newspaper
   laudations, and flattery of society, especially of the women; on the
   second, the evergrowing rewards, which, however, do not keep pace with
   the constantly growing demands; on the third, -- the insistence of
   publishers, who vie with one another, flatter, implore, and no longer
   judge of the quality of the productions offered by the author, but in
   ecstasy accept everything which appears over the name that has
   established its reputation with the reading public. All these
   temptations are so great that they evidently intoxicate the author: he
   succumbs to them, and, though he continues to work out his novels as
   regards their forms, and does it even better than before, and even
   loves what he describes, he no longer loves what he describes because
   it is good and moral, that is, because it is loved by everybody, and
   hates what he describes not because it is bad and despised by
   everybody, but only because one thing accidentally pleases and another
   displeases him.

   Upon all the novels of Maupassant, beginning with Bel-Ami, lies this
   stamp of haste and, above all, of fictiousness. From that time on
   Maupassant no longer does what he did in his first two novels, -- he
   does not take for the foundation of his novels certain moral demands
   and on their basis describe the activity of his persons, but writes his
   novels as all artisan novelists write theirs, that is, he invents the
   most interesting and the most pathetic or most contemporary persons and
   situations, and from these composes his novel, adorning it with all
   those observations which he has happened to make and which fit into the
   canvas of the novel, without the slightest concern how the events
   described are related to the demands of morality. Such are Pierre et
   Jean, Fort comme la Mort, and Notre Coeur.

   No matter how much we are accustomed to read in French novels about how
   families live by threes, and how there is always a lover, whom all but
   the husband know, it still remains quite incomprehensible to us how it
   is that all husbands are always fools, cocus, and ridicules, and all
   lovers, who in the end marry and become husbands, are neither ridicule
   nor cocus', but heroes. And still less can we understand in what way
   all women are loose in morals and all mothers holy.

   It is on these unnatural and improbable and, above all, profoundly
   immoral situations that Pierre et Jean and Fort comme la Mort are
   constructed. and so the sufferings of the persons who are in these
   situations do not touch us much. Pierre's and Jean's mother, who was
   able to pass all her life in deceiving her husband, evokes little
   sympathy for herself when she is compelled to confess her sin to her
   son, and still less when she justifies herself, asserting that she
   could not help making use of the opportunity of happiness which
   presented itself to her. Still less can we sympathize with the
   gentleman who, in Fort comme la Mort, during his whole life deceived
   his friend, corrupted his wife, and now laments because, having grown
   old, he is not able to corrupt also the daughter of his paramour. But
   the last novel, Notre Coeur, does not even have any inner problem,
   except the description of all kinds of shades of sexual love. What is
   described is a satiated, idle debauchee, who does not know what he
   wants, and who now falls in with just as debauched, mentally debauched,
   a woman, without even any justification of sensuality, and now parts
   from her and falls in with a servant girl, and now again falls in with
   the first and, it seems, lives with both. Though in Pierre et Jean and
   Fort comme la Mort there are touching scenes, this last novel provokes
   nothing but disgust in us.

   The question in Maupassant's first novel, Une Vie, stands like this.
   Here is a good, clever, dear human being, ready for anything good, and
   this being for some reason is sacrificed, at first to a coarse, petty,
   stupid animal of a husband, and then to just such a son, and perishes
   aimlessly, without having given anything to the world. What is this
   for? The author puts the question like that, and does not seem to give
   any answer. But his whole novel, all his sentiments of sympathy for her
   and disgust with what ruined her serve as an answer to his question. If
   there is one man who has understood her sufferings and has given
   expression to this understanding, these sufferings are redeemed, as Job
   says to his friends, when they say that no one will find out about his
   suffering. Let a suffering be made known and understood, and it is
   redeemed. Here the author saw and comprehended this suffering and
   showed it to men. And this suffering is redeemed, because, as soon as
   it is understood by men, it will sooner or later be destroyed.

   In the next novel, Bel-Ami, the question is no longer as to why there
   is any suffering for the worthy, but why there is wealth and glory for
   the unworthy. And what are this wealth and glory, and how are they
   acquired? And just as before, this question includes an answer, which
   consists in the negation of everything which is so highly valued by the
   crowd. The contents of this second novel are still serious, but the
   moral relation of the author to the subject described is considerably
   weakened, and while in the first novel only here and there occur
   blemishes of sensuality, which spoil the novel, in Bel-Ami these
   blemishes expand, and many chapters are written in mere obscenity, in
   which the author seems to revel.

   In the next novel, Mont-Oriol, the questions as to why and for what
   purpose are the sufferings of the dear woman and the success and joys
   of the savage male are no longer put, but it seems to be assumed that
   it ought to be so, and the moral demands are almost not felt; instead
   there appear, without any need and evoked by no artistic demands,
   obscene, sensuous descriptions. As a striking example of this violation
   of art, in consequence of the incorrect relation of the author to the
   subject, may with particular vividness serve the detailed description
   of the appearance of the heroine in the bathtub, which is given in this
   novel. This description is of no use whatsoever, and is in no way
   connected with the external or the internal meaning of the novel:
   bubbles cling to the pink body.

   "Well?" asks the reader.

   "That's all," replies the author. "I describe, because I like such
   descriptions."

   In the next two novels, Pierre et Jean and Fort comme la Mort, no moral
   demand whatever is to be found. Both novels are constructed on
   debauchery, deception, and lying, which bring the dramatis personae to
   tragic situations.

   In the last novel, Notre Coeur, the condition of the dramatis personae
   is most monstrous, savage, and immoral, and these persons no longer
   struggle against anything, but only seek enjoyments, of ambition, of
   the senses, of the sexual passion, and the author seems to sympathize
   completely with their strivings. The only conclusion one can draw from
   this last novel is this, that the greatest happiness in life is sexual
   intercourse, and that, therefore, we must in the most agreeable manner
   make use of this happiness.

   Still more startling in this immoral relation to life as it is
   expressed in the quasi-novel, Yvette. The contents of this terribly
   immoral production are as follows: a charming girl, with an innocent
   soul, but corrupted in the forms which she has acquired in the corrupt
   surroundings of her mother, deludes the debauchee. He falls in love
   with her, but, imagining that this girl consciously talks that
   insinuating nonsense which she has learned in her mother's company, and
   which she repeats like a parrot, without understanding it, he imagines
   that the girl is corrupt, and coarsely proposes a liaison with her.
   This proposition frightens and offends her (she love him), opens her
   eyes to her position and to that of her mother, and makes her suffer
   deeply. The touching situation -- the conflict of the beauty of the
   innocent soul with the immorality of the world -- is beautifully
   described, and it would have been well to stop here, but the author,
   without the least external or internal need, continues his narration
   and causes this gentleman to make his way to the girl at night and
   seduce her. In the first part of the novel, the author had evidently
   been on the side of the girl, and in the second he suddenly passed over
   to the side of the debauchee. One impression destroys the other, and
   the whole novel falls to pieces and breaks up, like bread which has not
   been kneaded.

   In all his novels after Bel-Ami (I am not speaking now of his shorter
   stories, which form his chief desert and fame, -- of them I shall speak
   later), Maupassant obviously surrendered himself to the theory, which
   not only existed in his circle in Paris, but which now exists
   everywhere among artists, that for an artistic production we not only
   need have no clear conception of what is good and what bad, but that,
   on the contrary, the artist must absolutely ignore all moral questions,
   -- that in this does a certain merit of the artist consist. According
   to this theory an artist can and must represent what is true, what
   exists, or what is beautiful, what, consequently, pleases him or even
   what can be useful as material for "science," but it is not the
   business of the artist to trouble himself about what is moral or
   immoral, good or bad.

   I remember, a famous painter showed me once his painting, which
   represented a religious procession. Everything was exquisitely painted,
   but I could not see any relation of the artist to his subject.

   "Well, do you consider these rites good, and do you think that they
   ought to be performed, or do you not?" I asked that artist.

   The artist said to me, with a certain condescension to my naivete, that
   he did not know and did not consider it necessary to know: his business
   was to represent life.

   "But do you at least love this?"

   "I cannot tell you."

   "Well, do you despise these rites?"

   "Neither the one nor the other," replied, with a smile of compassion
   for my stupidity, the modern highly cultured artist, who represented
   life without understanding its meaning and without either loving or
   hating its phenomena. Even so unfortunately thought Maupassant.

   In his introduction to Pierre et Jean he says that people tell the
   writer: "Consolez-moi, attristez-moi, attendrissez-moi, faites-moi
   rever, faites-moi rire, faites-moi fremir, faites-moi pleurer,
   faites-moi penser. Seuls quel-eues esprits d'elites demandent a
   l'artist: faites-moi quel-que chose de beau dans la forme qui vous
   conviendra le mieux d'apres votre temperament."

   It was to satisfy the demand of these chosen spirits that Maupassant
   wrote his novels, imagining naively that that which was considered
   beautiful in his circle was the beautiful which art ought to serve.

   In the same circle in which Maupassant moved, it is woman, a young,
   beautiful, for the most part a nude woman, and the sexual intercourse
   with her that have preeminently been considered to be that beauty which
   art must serve. Such an opinion was held not only by Maupassant's
   fellows in "art," by painters, sculptors, novelists, and poets, but
   also by philosophers, the teachers of the younger generations. Thus the
   famous Renan says frankly in his work, Marc Aurele, while condemning
   Christianity for its lack of appreciation of feminine beauty:

   "Le defaut du christianisme apparait bien ici, il est trop uniquement
   moral: la beaute chez-lui est tout-a-fait sacrifiee. Or, aux yeux d'une
   philosophie complete, la beaute, loin d'etre un avantage superviciel,
   un danger, un inconvenient, est un don de Dieu, comme la vertu. Elle
   vaut la vertu; la femme belle exprime aussi bien une face du but divin,
   une des fins de Dieu, que l'homme de genie ou la femme vertueuse. Elle
   le sait et de la sa fierte. Elle sent instinctivement le tresor infini
   qu'elle porte en son corps; elle sait bien, que sans esprit, sans
   talent, sans grave vertu, elle compte entre les premieres
   manifestations de Dieu: et pourquoi lui interdire de mettre en valeur
   le don, qui lui a ete fait, de sortir le diamant qui lui est echu?

   "La femme, en se passant, accomplit un devoir; elle pratique un art,
   art exquis, en un sens le plus charmant des arts. Ne nous laissons pas
   egarer par le sourire que certains mots provoquent chez les gens
   frivoles. On decerne la palme du genie a l'artiste grec qui a su
   resoudre le plus delicat des problemes, orner le corps humain, c'est a
   orner la perfection meme, et l'on ne veut voir qu'une affaire de
   chiffons dans l'essai de collaborer a la plus belle oeuvre de Dieu, a
   la beaute de la femme! La toilette de la femme, avec tous ses
   raffinements, est du grand art a sa maniere.

   "Les siecles et les pays, qui savent y reussir, -- sont les grands
   siecles, les grands pays, et le christianisme montra par l'exclusion
   dont il frappa le genre de recherches que l'ideal social qu'il
   concevait ne deviendrait le cadre d'une societe complete que bien plus
   tard, quand la revolte des genes du monde aurait brise le joug etroit
   impose primitivement a la secte par un pietisme exalte" (Marc Aurele,
   p. 555).

   (Thus, according to the opinion of this guide of the younger
   generations, it is only now that the Parisian tailors and wigmakers
   have mended the mistake made by Christianity, and have reestablished
   beauty in its real, high significance.)

   To leave no doubt in what sense beauty is to be taken, this same famous
   writer, historian, and scholar wrote a drama, L'Abbesse de Jouarre, in
   which he showed that sexual intercourse with a woman is that very
   ministration to beauty, that is, a high and good work. In this drama,
   which is remarkable for its absence of talent and especially for the
   coarseness of Darcy's conversations with the Abbess, where we can see
   from the very first words of what love this gentleman is speaking with
   the apparently innocent and highly moral girl, who is not in the least
   offended by this, -- it appears that the most highly moral people, in
   the sight of death, to which they are condemned, a few hours before it
   can do nothing more beautiful that surrender themselves to their animal
   passion.

   Thus, in the circle in which Maupassant grew up and was educated, the
   representation of feminine beauty and love has quite seriously, and as
   something long ago decided and determined by the cleverest and most
   learned of men, been considered to be the true problem of the highest
   art, -- le grand art.

   It is to this theory, frightful in its insipidity, that Maupassant was
   subjected, when he became a fashionable writer. And, as was to have
   been expected, in the novels this false ideal led Maupassant to a
   series of mistakes and to weaker and ever weaker productions.

   In this showed itself the radical difference which exists between the
   demands of the novel and those of the story. The novel has for its
   problem, even for its external problem, the description of the whole
   human life or of many human lives, and so the writer of a novel must
   have a clear and firm idea of what is good and what bad in life, and
   Maupassant did not possess that; on the contrary, according to the
   theory to which he held, it was thought that that was not necessary. If
   he had been a novelist like some untalented writers of sensuous novels,
   he would have calmly described as good what is bad, and his novels
   would be complete and interesting for people sharing the same views as
   the author. But Maupassant had talent, that is, he saw things in their
   real form, and so he involuntarily revealed the truth: he involuntarily
   saw the bad in what he wanted to regard as good. For this reason his
   sympathy is constantly wavering in all his novels, with the exception
   of the first: now he represents the bad as being good, now he
   recognizes the bad to be bad and the good to be good, and now again he
   keeps all the time jumping from one to the other. But this destroys the
   very essence of every artistic impression, the charpente, on which he
   stands. People who are not very sensitive to art frequently imagine
   that an artistic production forms one whole, because the same persons
   act in it all the time, because everything is constructed on one plot,
   or because the life on one man is described. That is not true. That
   only seems to the superficial observer: the cement which binds every
   artistic production into one whole and so produces the illusion of a
   reflection of life is not the unity of persons and situations, but the
   unity of the original, moral relation of the author to his subject. In
   reality, when we read or contemplate an artistic production by a new
   author, the fundamental question which arises in our soul is always
   this: "Well, what kind of a man are you? How do you differ from all
   other men whom I know, and what new thing can you tell me about the way
   we ought to look upon our life?" No matter what the artist may
   represent, -- saints, robbers, kings, lackeys, -- we seek and see only
   the artist's soul. If he is an old, familiar artist, the question is no
   longer, "who are you?" but, "Well, what new thing can you tell me? From
   what new side will you now illumine my life for me?" And so an author
   who has no definite, clear, new view of the world, and still more so
   the one who does not consider this to be necessary, cannot give an
   artistic production. He can write beautifully, and a great deal, but
   there will be no artistic production. Even so it was with Maupassant in
   his novels. In his first two novels, especially in the first, Une Vie,
   there was that clear, definite, new relation to life, and so there was
   an artistic production; but as soon as he, submitting to the
   fashionable theory, decided that there is no need whatever for this
   relation of the author to life, and began to write only in order to
   faire quelque chose de beau, his novels ceased to be artistic
   productions. In Une Vie and Bel-Ami the author knows who is to be loved
   and who is to be hated, and the reader agrees with him and believes
   him, believes in those persons and events which are described to him.
   But in Notre Coeur and in Yvette the author does not know who is to be
   loved and who is to be hated; nor does the reader know it. And as the
   reader does not know it, he does not believe in the events described
   and is not interested in them. And so, with the exception of the first
   tow, or, speaking strictly, of the one first novel, all of Maupassant's
   novels, as novels, are weak; and if Maupassant had left us only his
   novels, he would be a striking example of how a brilliant gift may
   perish in consequence of that false milieu in which it was evolved, and
   of those false theories of art which are invented by men who do not
   love it and so do not understand it. But, fortunately, Maupassant has
   written short stories, in which he did not succumb to the false theory
   which he adopted, and wrote, not quelque chose de beau, but what
   touched and provoked his moral feeling. It is in these stories, not in
   all, but in the best of them, that we see how the moral feeling grew in
   the author.

   In this, indeed, does the remarkable quality of every true talent
   consist, so long as it does not do violence to itself under the
   influence of a false theory, that it teaches its possessor, leads him
   on over the path of moral development, makes him love what is worth of
   love, and hate what is worthy of hatred. An artist is an artist for the
   very reason that he sees the objects, not as he wants to see them, but
   as they are. The bearer of talent, -- man, -- may make mistakes, but
   the talent, as soon as the reins are given to it, as was done by
   Maupassant in his stories, will reveal and lay bare the subject and
   will make the writer love it, if it is worth of love, and hate it, if
   it is worthy of hatred. What happens to every true artist, when, under
   the influence of his surroundings, he begins to describe something
   different from what he ought to describe, is what happened to Balaam,
   who, when he wanted to bless, cursed that which ought to have been
   cursed, and, when he wanted to curse, began to bless that which ought
   to have been blessed; he will involuntarily do, not what he wants, but
   what he ought to do. The same happened with Maupassant.

   There has hardly been another such an author, who thought so sincerely
   that all the good, the whole meaning of life was in woman, in love, and
   who with such force of passion described woman and the love of her from
   all sides, and there has hardly been another author, who with such
   clearness and precision has pointed out all the terrible sides of the
   same phenomenon, which to him seemed to be the highest, and one that
   gives the greatest good to men. The more he comprehended this
   phenomenon, the more did it become unveiled; the shrouds fell off, and
   all there was left was its terrible consequences and its still more
   terrible reality.

   Read his Idiot Son," "A Night with the Daughter" (L'Ermite), "The
   Sailor and His Sister" (Le Port), "Field of Olives," La Petit Roque,
   the English Miss Harriet, Monsieur Parent, L'Armoire (the girl that
   fell asleep in the safe), "The Marriage" in Sur l'Eau, and the last
   expression of everything, Un Cas de Divorce. What Marcus Aurelius said,
   trying to find means with which to destroy in imagination the
   attractiveness of this sin, Maupassant does in glaring, artistic
   pictures, which upset one completely. He wants to laud love, but the
   more he knew of it, the more he cursed it. He cursed it for the
   calamities and sufferings which it brings with it, and for the
   disappointments, and, above all, for the simulation of true love, for
   the deception which is in it, and from which man suffers the more, the
   more he abandons himself to this deception.

   The might moral growth of the author, during his literary activity, is
   written in indelible characters in these exquisite short stories and in
   his best book, Sur l'Eau.

   And not merely in this discrowning, this involuntary and, therefore, so
   much more powerful discrowning of sexual love, do we see the author's
   moral growth; we see it also in all those higher and ever higher
   demands which he makes on life.

   Not only in sexual love does he see the inner contradiction between the
   demands of the animal and of the rational man, -- he sees it in the
   whole structure of the world.

   He sees that the world, the material world, such as it is, is not only
   not the best of worlds, but, on the contrary, might have been quite
   different, -- this idea is strikingly expressed in Horla, -- and does
   not satisfy the demands of reason and of love; he sees that there is a
   certain other world, or at least there are the demands for such a
   world, in man's soul.

   He is tormented, not only by the irrationality of the material world
   and the absence of beauty in it, but also by its lack of love, by its
   disunion. I know of no more heartrending cry of despair of an erring
   man who recognizes his loneliness, than the expression of this idea in
   the exquisite story, Solitude.

   The phenomenon which more than any other tortured Maupassant, and to
   which he frequently returned, is the agonizing state of loneliness, the
   spiritual loneliness of a man, that barrier which stands between a man
   and others, that barrier which, as he says, is felt the more painfully,
   the closer the bodily contact.

   What is it that tortures him? And what would he have? What destroys
   this barrier, what puts a stop to this loneliness? Love, not love of
   woman, of which he is tired, but pure, spiritual, divine love. and it
   is this that Maupassant seeks; toward this saviour of life, which was
   long ago clearly revealed to all, that he painfully tugs at the feters
   with which he feels himself bound.

   He is not yet able to name what he is seeking, he does not want to name
   it with his lips alone, for fear of defiling his sanctuary. But his
   unnamed striving, which is expressed by his terror in the presence of
   solitude, is so sincere that it infects us and draws us more powerfully
   than many, very many sermons of love, which are enunciated with the
   lips alone.

   The tragedy of Maupassant's life consists in this, that, living in
   surroundings that are terrible because of their monstrousness and
   immorality, he by the force of his talent, that unusual light which was
   in him, broke away from the world-conception of his circle, was near to
   liberation, already breathed the air of freedom, but, having spent his
   last strength in this struggle, perished without becoming free, because
   he did not have the strength to make this one last effort.

   The tragedy of this ruin consists in the same in which it even now
   continues to consist for the majority of the so-called men of our time.

   Men have in general never lived without an explanation of the meaning
   of the life they live. Everywhere and at all times there have appeared
   advanced, highly gifted men, prophets, as they are called, who have
   explained to men this meaning and significance of life, and at all
   times the men of the rank and file, who have no strength to make this
   meaning clear to themselves, have followed that explanation of life
   which their prophets revealed to them.

   This meaning was eighteen hundred years ago simply, lucidly,
   indubitably, and joyously explained by Christianity, as is proved by
   the life of all those who have accepted this meaning and follow that
   guide of life which follows from this meaning.

   But there appeared men who interpreted this meaning in such a way that
   it became nonsense. And people are as in a dilemma, -- whether to
   recognize Christianity, as it is interpreted by Catholicism, Lourdes,
   the Pope, the dogma of the seedless conception, and so forth, or to
   live on, being guided by the instructions of Renan and his like, that
   is, to live without any guidance and comprehension of life,
   surrendering themselves to their lusts, so long as they are strong, and
   to their habits, when the passions have subsided.

   And the people, the people of the rank and file, choose one or the
   other, sometimes both, at first libertinism, and then Catholicism. And
   people continue to live thus for generations, shielding themselves with
   different theories, which are not invented in order to find out the
   truth, but in order to conceal it. And the people of the rank and file,
   especially the dull ones among them, feel at ease.

   But there are also other people, -- there are but a few of them and
   they are far between -- and such was Maupassant, who with their own
   eyes see things as they are, see their meaning, see the contradictions
   of life, which are hidden from others, and vividly present to
   themselves that to which these contradictions must inevitably lead
   them, and seek for their solutions in advance. They seek for them
   everywhere except where they are to be found, in Christianity, because
   Christianity seems to them to have outlived its usefulness, to be
   obsolete and foolish and repellent by its monstrosity. Trying in vain
   to arrive by themselves at these solutions, they come to the conclusion
   that there are no solutions, that the property of life consists in
   carrying within oneself these unsolved contradictions. Having arrived
   at such a solution, these people, if they are weak, unenergetic
   natures, make their peace with such a senseless life, are even proud of
   their condition, considering their lack of knowledge to be a desert, a
   sign of culture; but if they are energetic, truthful, and talented
   natures, such as was Maupassant, they cannot bear it and in one way or
   another go out of this insipid life.

   It is as though thirsty people in the desert should be looking
   everywhere for water, except near those men who, standing near a
   spring, pollute it and offer ill-smelling mud instead of water, which
   still keeps on flowing farther down, below the mud. Maupassant was in
   that position; he could not believe, -- it even never occurred to him
   that the truth which he was seeking had been discovered long ago and
   was near him; nor could he believe that it was possible for a man to
   live in a contradiction such as he felt himself to be living in.

   Life, according to those theories in which he was brought up, which
   surrounded him, and which were verified by all the passions of his
   youthful and spiritually and physically strong being, consists in
   enjoyment, chief of which is woman and the love of her, and in the
   doubly reflected enjoyment, -- in the representation of this love and
   the excitation of this love in others. All that would be very well,
   but, as we look closely at these enjoyments, we see amidst them appear
   phenomena which are quite alien and hostile to this love and this
   beauty: woman for some reason grows homely, looks horrid in her
   pregnancy, bears a child in nastiness, then more children, unwished-for
   children, then deceptions, cruelties, then moral sufferings, then
   simply old age, and finally death.

   And then, is this beauty really beauty? And the, what is it all for? It
   would be nice, if it were possible to arrest life. But it goes on. What
   does it mean, -- life goes on? Life goes on, means, -- the hair falls
   out and grows gray, the teeth decay, there appear wrinkles, and there
   is an odour in the mouth. Even before everything ends, everything
   becomes terrible and disgusting: you perceive the pasty paint and
   powder, the sweat, thee stench, the homeliness. Where is that which I
   served? Where is beauty? And it is all. If it is not, -- there is
   nothing. There is no life.

   Not only is there no life in what seemed to have life, but you, too,
   begin to get away from it, to grow feeble, to look homely, to decay,
   while others before your very eyes seize from you those pleasures in
   which was the whole good of life. More than that: there begins to glint
   the possibility of another life, something else, some other union of
   men with the whole world, such as excludes all those deceptions,
   something else, something that cannot be impaired by anything, that is
   true and always beautiful. But that cannot be, -- it is only the
   provoking sight of an oasis, when we know that it is not there and that
   everything is sand.

   Maupassant lived down to that tragic moment of life when there began
   the struggle between the lie of the life which surrounded him, and the
   truth which he was beginning to see. He already had symptoms of
   spiritual birth.

   It is these labours of birth that are expressed in his best
   productions, especially in his short stories.

   If it had been his fate not to die in the labour of birth, but to be
   born, he would have given great, instructive productions, but even what
   he gave us during the process of his birth is much. Let us be grateful
   to this strong, truthful man for what he gave us.

   Voronezh, April 2, 1894.
