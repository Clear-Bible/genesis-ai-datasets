LECTURE XIII. [1]

   1 John v. 7.

   For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
   the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and
   these three are one.

   I INTEND no long discourse upon this subject, nor longer than may
   consist with the design of going over the several heads of religion, in
   as plain a manner, and in as short a way as I can. It would very ill
   agree with such a design, to insist upon, and discourse upon all the
   several texts of Scripture arguments and objections this way and that,
   which are wont to be ventilated upon this point. All that can be
   expected, according to the course I have proposed to use, will be
   barely to represent that which I take, and which (I hope) we generally
   agree to be the truth in this matter, in as few and as plain words as
   is possible. If one should take the large course, which some (it may
   be) would expect, it would be to make one particular subject the
   business of a long life's time, and would he to turn this place into a
   theatre of contentious disputations rather than serious instructions,
   tending only to gratify vain minds, rather than to edify the sober
   mind.

   I shall not need to stay at all upon the particular controversy about
   this text, the authenticity of it, which, it is true, is disputed: but
   upon that account only, that some copies have been found not to have
   it. But for such as are in doubt there upon concerning it, I need do no
   more than recommend them (amongst others) to what hath been most
   judiciously, and, indeed, very charitably written as to that matter by
   Dr. Hammond, in his, annotations on the New Testament, where he hath,
   with equal judgment and charity, represented how it is very easily
   supposable that in the transcribing of some copy or another, two verses
   coming here together, this seventh and eighth that do begin and end,
   both of them, somewhat alike, the eye of the transcriber might fall
   upon the latter, and so write without looking back to the former. A
   very obvious supposition, and a great deal more probable (as it is a
   great deal more charitable) than to suppose that either side, in the
   time of the Arian controversy, did design a corruption of the Scripture
   text; I say, it is a great deal more rational, (as it is more
   charitable) because indeed it had been a very foolish thing, merely out
   of favour to one side, to have corrupted the Scripture in that one
   particular place, leaving other scriptures to stand as they were that
   speak so fully the same thing, as that xxviii. Math. 18, 19. and that
   John x. 30. "I and my Father are one." It is not likely there should be
   a designed corruption, where the loss of reputation would be so very
   great, and the gain and advantage so very little; but we have reason
   enough to be satisfied that the most ancient copies have it as we here
   find.

   And for the way of managing the discourse upon this subject, I shall
   not offer at that which some have done, the demonstrating a Trinity in
   the Godhead in a rational way, as that which some have supposed
   sufficiently evident by rational light; and which some have made it
   their business to evince, (both Poiret and others before him,) and with
   no contemptible endeavour. But whether such do demonstrate their point
   yea or no, it is to me a very strong demonstration of the strange
   imbecility of the human mind, that some should think it ration ally
   demonstrable, that, that cannot but be, which others take to be
   rationally demonstrable cannot be. This, I say, it is a great
   demonstration to me of; and I do believe that they who do read the
   other writings of Poiret and others, who think the Trinity rationally
   demonstrable, and read the writings of Socinus and others, his
   followers, who think the contrary, will apprehend in other matters,
   Poiret to be as rational a man as ever Socinus was, or any that
   followed him. Compare the writings of the one and the other, in other
   matters; and then I say, it is a strong demonstration, and that which
   doth require our very serious thoughts, of the imbecility of the minds
   of men, and how little the confident pretences to rational
   demonstrations, by interested persons, engaged and dipped in a party
   this way and that, are to be relied upon, when some very highly
   rational men shall undertake to demonstrate, that it is impossible this
   should be; when others as rational as they, shall undertake to
   demonstrate it is impossible not to be. That is, that there could have
   been no such thing as creation nor indeed any action in the Deity, and
   consequently, no Deity at all if there were not a Trinity in it. That
   is, if there were not an eternal mind which, when there was nothing
   else, should like an intellectual sun turn its beams inward upon
   itself, and so by consequence, beget an eternal action, its own eternal
   image, and that there must be an eternal love between that mind
   begetting, and the mind begotten: and there you have the Trinity in the
   Deity.

   But this I insist not on; only that it may appear that it is not
   impossible: and I hope that all pretence that it is, will in due time,
   and easily vanish. It is so plainly revealed in Scripture, that there
   is a Trinity in the Godhead, that we may very well take it upon the
   word of him that reports it to us, and who best (we may be sure)
   understands his own nature. Take it, I say, amongst those things of
   God, which are only to be known by the Spirit of God; as there are
   things of a man, that are only known by the spirit of a man that is in
   him: (as the apostle speaks, 1 Cor. ii. 14.) and if the mind and spirit
   of every particular man, have its own particularities known only to
   itself, till the man is pleased to reveal and make them known, sure it
   is very little strange that the divine Being should have his
   peculiarities too, not otherwise knowable than as he is pleased to
   reveal them. And if he plainly reveal to us, that there is a Trinity in
   the Unity of his nature, then surely, to sober inquirers and learners,
   the business is done.

   As to the latter part of the verse, I shall not need to insist upon it,
   "these three are one," having, I hope, sufficiently evinced to you the
   Unity of the Godhead from another text. And I chose to do it from
   another text rather, that had that expression in it which this hath
   not. For this doth not expressly say, these three are one God, but it
   doth say, these three are one. But having already proved to you that
   the Godhead is but one, it leads us with so much the more clearness
   (having asserted the doctrine of the unity of the Godhead to be true)
   to apprehend, that it must be the truth of this place, and so shall
   have occasion but to repeat concerning that which we have already
   proved, but not to prove it any more. And therefore, the plain contents
   of this scripture you may take thus--that there is a Trinity in the
   Deity, or--if you will, a little more largely that there are three
   which we cannot more fitly express or conceive of, than by the name of
   persons, in the only one Godhead. And,

   I. I shall evince the truth of this doctrine.

   And now to let you see that this is reasonably given you, as the sense
   and meaning of this place, I shall proceed by some gradual steps: and,

   1. To prepare my way, let you see that this is spoken here in this
   place; it is the doctrine of this place. So that if it can be made
   appear to be in itself true, we shall have all the reason in the world
   to conclude, that it is fitly represented as the doctrine held forth in
   this text. And for the truth of the thing, we shall come to consider
   from other places afterwards. And,

   (1.) It seems very reasonable, inasmuch as we otherwise ascertained
   that there is but one God, that the one thing where in the three
   persons mentioned are said to be united, is the Godhead. "These three
   are one." One what? It is most reasonable to understand the meaning is,
   that they are one God, though this be not expressed in the text. For it
   is very plain, from what hath been already said, that the Godhead can
   be but one. And when it is said, there are three in heaven that are nil
   one, that one thing which they are said to be, must needs be God, or
   the Godhead wherein they are said to unite; especially the Father being
   said to be one of the three, concerning whose Godhead there is no
   doubt.

   (2.) It is very plain, (upon supposition that the three mentioned in
   the text do unite, or are united in the Godhead,) the meaning must be,
   that they are one God and no more; that is, that the one God which they
   are said to be, is but one, is one God and no more. There can be no
   reason imagined why it should be said they are one, if the intendment
   were not that they were only one; or that that thing which they are
   said to be, is but one. To say the Godhead is one, it must always mean
   one exclusively, that is, that there is no other God but that, that
   one. And so, that is the thing that these three do unite, or are united
   in: not one witness, it is not a being united in their end: that cannot
   be meant here: for it is manifest that the apostle doth vary the form
   of expression in the following verse, where it is said, "These three
   agree in one;" all to one purpose, all to one design, all giving one
   and the same testimony concerning Christ, concerning that Jesus who was
   descended and come down into this world. But here it is said in the
   text, they are one, are one thing, not one person, and therefore, it
   doth signify that they do agree, or do unite and meet in that wherein
   it is never intended to say or intimate that they differ: that is, in
   essence they are united, but not in personality. If it had been a
   person that was spoken of, then it would have been proper enough, to
   have spoken of it under the notion of things. But inasmuch as it is the
   essence, and not the person, that is here intended, therefore it is
   said, one thing: if we would read the words literally, it is, "these
   three are one thing." that is the meaning of them and so they should be
   rendered.

   (3.) Hereupon it is very rational to conclude, that when it is said,
   there are three that are united in this one thing, that it must also be
   understood, they are three and no more, as by one is meant only one, so
   by three is meant only three. Whereupon,

   (4.) It must with equal reason be concluded, that these three which are
   three, and no more, must needs be some eminent three, and of some very
   eminent order. And do but pause here a little, and see if light do not
   spring into your minds about this matter: when it is said there are
   three (it being by parity of reason to be understood, three and no
   more) in heaven, Pray what three in heaven can there be, that are
   three, and no more, of one eminent order, but they must be three divine
   persons? Bethink yourselves of it a little: it cannot be three angels,
   for then it cannot be said, there are three and no more in heaven: and
   you have not heard of any higher creatures than angels, any superior
   order of creatures above angels, of which there are three and no more:
   and it cannot be three Gods, because the Godhead is but one; there is
   but one God and no more. Then I beseech you, What is there left? It is
   not three angels, it is not three of any sort of creatures superior to
   angels, of whom there are three and no more. And the Father is here
   mentioned as one of them, of whose Godhead there can be no doubt: and
   then pray consider, What can these three be? Not three creatures, not
   three Gods; therefore, they can be nothing but three persons, three
   substances in the Godhead. Thus then you are gradually led on to see,
   that this is the plain doctrine of the text, and if you can be
   convinced that there is in it, veritas rei, the truth of the thing,
   there will be no doubt at all but that it is veritas loci, the truth of
   this place.

   2. And that is it I now come to, that is, to evince to you veritatem
   rei, the truth of the thing, that there is a Trinity in the Godhead,
   that there are three that are all of them this one God. And, I shall
   (with all possible brevity) labour to prove it to you positively, from
   other scriptures and scripture considerations, and then--shew you the
   unreasonableness of what is pretended against it, how irrational the
   pretence is against such a thing. That is, that there should be three
   who in some one respect are truly to be said and called three, and in
   some other respect are as truly to be called, or said to be but one.
   But,

   (1.) I come to the positive proof. And because, concerning the
   personality and deity of the Father there is no question; there is none
   that will contend with us about that matter, therefore our business
   will relate to the other two. And concerning them, that is, the Word
   (as he is here called) and the Holy Ghost, I shall endeavour to evince
   to you these two things--that they are persons,--and that they are
   divine persons.

   [1.] That they are persons. And here (as I have told you) we have not a
   fitter notion under which to conceive of them, nor a fitter word in our
   tongue by which to express or speak of them. Not that we can think,
   that person being afterwards to be clothed with the notion of divine,
   can be the same thing with God as with us; because it is impossible any
   thing can have one common notion to him and to us. That would be
   altogether inconsistent with the perfection, the universal perfection
   of the divine Being, to suppose that any notion could be common to him
   and the creature. For then, he should not comprehend all entity in
   himself, if there were a notion common to him and to us; for that must
   import something superior to both, and that were comprehensive of both,
   and so it would make God but a part of being. Therefore, the word
   person as any other word whatsoever, that is wont to be applied to, and
   spoken of God and of us, must be spoken of us but analogically, not
   univocally, not as if it signified the same thing when it is spoken of
   him, and when it is spoken of us. And therefore, we are not to judge of
   a divine person by a human person, or by a created person. The
   difference is infinite, and the distance is infinite between God and
   any creature. So any thing that is spoken of him must infinitely differ
   from whatsoever maybe spoken of us under the same name. Therefore, when
   we speak of a person, among creatures, as signifying an intelligent
   suppositum, being, neither suppositum nor intelligent can be the same
   with him and with us. His intellect and ours differ infinitely: and it
   is so little known how individuations are made among creatures, that it
   is infinitely more impossible how they are made with God. But that
   being premised, that these two, the Word and the Holy Ghost are so
   spoken of in Scripture, as that we have no other way of conceiving
   otherwise than that they must be spoken of as persons; this I shall
   endeavour to evince.

   First. As concerning the Word, I only premise that which is in itself
   evident, that by the Word here, and the Son of God elsewhere, must be
   meant the same thing. As is plain in the first of St. John's Gospel:
   "In the beginning was the Word:" that which is called the Word there,
   is called the Son of God presently after, in the same chapter: "The
   Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the
   glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
   The Word and the Son are all one. Then, what is there and elsewhere
   called the Word sometimes, and sometimes Son, or the Son of God, that
   must needs mean what we can conceive of no otherwise than under the
   notion of a person. That is, we find the action, from time to time,
   ascribed to this Word, or this Son, of an intelligent agent, of one
   that did act understandingly and with design. And we can have no better
   signification of a person, no clearer notion of one than that is. He is
   constantly spoken of as an intelligent agent; and concerning that,
   there can be no difficulty, nor indeed is there any controversy between
   us and our antagonists, concerning his personality; only they will have
   him to be but a human person, which we shall in its own place consider
   by and by. And,

   Secondly. Concerning the Holy Ghost, that he also is a person, or such
   a one as we can conceive of under no other notion than that of a
   person; that is, as acting intelligently and with design: even so is he
   most apparently spoken of, from time to time, in Scripture. Hereupon it
   is said, He bears witness in heaven; as he did in heaven, and from
   thence, testify concerning Christ, that he was the Son of God, to be
   heard and obeyed and submitted to as such; and as a dove, descended in
   visible glory upon him from the heavens. This speaks the act of an
   intelligent, designing cause on his part, as to what he did in
   testifying, and so he is very frequently spoken of, as coming for such
   and such a purpose. "When he is come he shall convince the world." John
   xvi. 7, 8. And (which is most observable) in several parts of these
   chapters, of the 14. 15. and 16th of that gospel, even there, where he
   had been spoken of under the name of the Spirit before, when one would
   expect, in correspondence to that name spirit, it would have been said,
   it, it, being neutral, a word of the neuter gender, it is said he; when
   he is come, not when it is come, he shall convince the world of sin:
   yea, and even the very laws of grammar and syntax are waved, as if it
   were on purpose to hold out this one thing to us, that the Holy Ghost
   was a person, an intelligent Being, working and acting with design: for
   when we have the word spirit, presently he doth follow upon it: and at
   a very great distance, in one place, (several verses being interposed)
   from any other antecedent but spirit. Indeed, in the 14. and 15tli
   chapters, there was the comforter as well as the spirit, to which he,
   might have reference: but still, spirit was the nearer antecedent. But
   you will find, in the 16th chapter, the 13. and 14th verses, that there
   is no antecedent for many verses together, besides spirit, and
   afterwards immediately subjoined he, and not it, on purpose to signify
   (and we cannot imagine what it should be to signify besides) the
   personality of the Holy Ghost. And it is a very unreasonable supposal,
   that in the form of baptism which we have, Matth. xxviii. 19. "Go ye,
   teach all nations, baptizing them, in the name of the Father, and of
   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" that the two first should be persons,
   (as they are confessed on all hands to be) and that there should be put
   in the same order with them a quality, as our antagonists would teach
   us to conceive concerning the Holy Ghost, baptizing them in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and what? of a quality, in the third place.
   That is, that when the design manifestly was there to state the Object
   of all practical religion, of the whole of our Christianity, into the
   believing whereof we are to be baptized, there should be a transient
   quality put into conjunction with those two great persons, the Father
   and the Son. Surely, it needs but to stay and to pause here a little,
   to have light irresistibly strike into the mind of any one that will do
   so, that will consider how unreasonable it is to imagine, when the
   design is manifestly to represent and state the entire object of whole
   Christianity, that is, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, that the
   two first of these are persons, and the third but a quality. Therefore,
   that being very plain,

   [2.] The second thing that needs to be evinced is, that they are divine
   persons, and much is done towards that already. It appearing they are
   persons, they cannot be created persons, they cannot be angels, of
   which it can be said there are three and no more. But we hear of no
   intervening order of creatures, above angels and below God. And then
   what should they be, since they are persons, (as is plain) but divine
   persons, that do subsist in the Godhead? And to evince this a little
   more distinctly, but very briefly,

   First. Concerning the Word, or the Son, (which you see are both of them
   names of the same person) how expressly is he often said to be God? In
   that mentioned first of John, nothing can be spoken more openly nor in
   plainer words. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God, and the Word was God." And Psalm xlv. 6. "Thy throne O God is for
   ever and ever," which the author to the Hebrews (chap. i. 8.) allegeth
   to be plainly said to the Son; "And to the Son he said, Thy throne, O
   God, is for ever and ever." So Romans ix. 5. "Of whom, as concerning
   the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever." And
   that, 1 John v. 20. "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath
   given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we
   are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true
   God and eternal life:" most fitly spoken of the Son who was to be the
   spring of life to us, according to what had been said a little above in
   the same chapter, "This is the record, that God hath given us eternal
   life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and
   he that hath not the Son hath not life."

   It is, I know, alleged with a great deal of triumph by some of the
   adversaries, that he is excluded in another place from being the true
   God, and that that should not be said of him, when we are told, (John
   xvii. 3.) "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
   true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." If the Father only be
   true God, then the Son is not. But the inconsequence of this will
   easily appear to them that shall but consider, how the word only is
   placed. It is placed so as to assert the predicate, and not the subject
   in the latter proposition. It is not said, Thou only art the true God,
   and so, that doth not exclude the Son at all. The Father is the only
   true God, and the Son is the only true God, and the Holy Ghost is the
   only true God. But it cannot be said that either the Father only is the
   true God, or the Son only is the true God, or the Holy Ghost only is
   the true God: but they are each of them that God which is the only true
   one, and of which there is but one and no more. Do but observe that the
   word only affects not the subject spoken of, but the thing affirmed, or
   spoken of that subject. The case is but like this, as if I should use
   these words, "This is the only London." It may be true for ought we
   know, that there is no other Lon don, but this which is famously called
   so by that name, but if one should say, "This only is London," that is,
   this place where we are, and there the only should limit the subject,
   that were false; for there are thousands of places in London as well as
   this, there are a great many assemblies in London, a great many places
   of worship and societies besides this: but we may say, "This is the
   only London," so the difference ib plain to any that will consider it.

   I might insist much more largely, (but it is not needful to say every
   thing that might be said in a plain case,) concerning the Son, to prove
   his divine personality by most manifest attributes of Deity, given him
   over and over in Scripture, as "The First and the Last:" creating
   power, as a Him by whom the world was made, and by whom he made the
   world," which is over and over said of him. Col. i. 15. Heb. i. 3. John
   i. beginning. And universal knowledge, Omnisciency, heart knowledge;
   "Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee." But then,

   Secondly. Concerning the divine person of the Holy Ghost, that he also
   is God; that doth sure, carry convictive light with it to any that do
   consider, that when the form of baptism is given (as was said) with
   design to state the whole object of our religion, "The Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Ghost" are mentioned together; and there can be no object
   of religion but God, none but a divine person: and we find the Holy
   Ghost frequently mentioned, upon the same account, as one of those
   eminent three. How many places are there (it were end less to name
   them) where these three are brought in together, as it were purposely
   to signify that they were ejusdem ordinus, of the same order; and that
   we are to conceive of each of them under the same notion, that is, that
   of Deity, of the Godhead in God. Look but to that 1 Pet. i. 2. Rom. i.
   4, 5. 2 Thes. ii. 13, 14: and a great many places besides, where these
   three are brought in still together. As if it were purposely to signify
   their being of one order, and as having, in distinct respects, a
   concern in our great affairs; those that relate to our salvation and
   blessedness. Besides, that it must be a great prevarication, to
   understand that place otherwise than as expressing the Holy Ghost to be
   God: Acts v. 3, 4. "Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the
   Holy Ghost?--thou hast not lied unto man, but unto God." And certainly
   if he were not God, it were the most dangerous thing in all the world,
   to have him represented to us as if he were: and so tempt men to pay
   the homage of divine worship to a creature. It is never to be imagined,
   that there would have been such a snare laid before us, to lead us into
   so dangerous a mistake as that: things would have been spoken more
   cautiously, if he had not been God, than, when it was just said before,
   "Why dost thou lie against the Holy Ghost?" so immediately to say,
   "Thou didst not lie to man but unto God." It is not to be thought, (the
   thing being so full of danger) to place the notion or homage of the
   Deity upon any thing to which it doth not belong, that there should
   have been such incautiousness used, or so little caution, as directly
   to lead and train persons into so perilous a mistake. But besides all
   this, to put the matter out of all doubt; whereas, they that will have
   the Holy Ghost not to be God, being urged, "What is he then?" do say,
   "He is the mighty power of God, a certain mighty vis emissa, a divine
   power that issues from God for the working such and such effects." As
   for this conceit, pray do but consider the matter thus, Is the Holy
   Ghost indeed not God, but the power of God? Why this power which it is
   said to be, is either a created power, or an uncreated one. If it be an
   uncreated power, He is God, for every thing that is uncreated is God:
   if he be then a created power, the created power of God, or the power
   of God, but created, then it seems God did, without power, create this
   power, and was without power till he had created it: so that he did the
   act of creation (which is an act of omnipotency) when he was impotent.
   It supposes, first, an impotent God, and then supposeth him, when he
   was impotent, to create his own power; that is, when he was without all
   power, he did that act which requires an infiniteness of power, to wit,
   to create. I know nothing that carries clearer evidence with it, than
   this doth, that the Holy Ghost cannot be that created power which these
   persons pretend to; or cannot be divine power distinct from God, from
   the very essence of God. Every thing of God is God, and cannot be
   otherwise. If he were the power of God and not God, he must have been
   created power, by God; that is to say, God did create omnipotent power,
   being before impotent; for this it plainly comes to.

   Thus far, I think, it Is with some competent clearness evident, that
   these three, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, (concerning the
   first, as you have heard, there is no question) are persons; they are
   that which we cannot conceive of otherwise than under the notion of
   persons: and they are divine persons, so that there are three divine
   persons that do subsist in the Godhead, that is but one. So you have
   this, as the doctrinal truth of this place, and as the real truth in
   itself, positively evidenced to you.

   What is to be said by way of objection against it, we shall next come
   to. Only upon the whole matter, it seems to me, that there needs a
   great deal more of humility and reverence and seriousness and fear of
   the Lord, over-awing the spirits of men, to apprehend this to be the
   plain doctrine of Scripture, than of further argument in the case. And
   that will more appear by considering how irrational the pretence is,
   that this is a thing rationally impossible, that there should be such
   three, that are but one God. Nothing indeed, would be plainer than that
   the same cannot be three and one, in one and the same respect: but,
   that they may be three in one respect, and but one in another respect,
   we may make appear to be no impossible thing, and that there is nothing
   of harshness in it, nay, whereof we have parallel instances, (as far as
   there can be a parity between God and creatures) that occur to us every
   day. So that one would wonder how men can stumble in so plain a way,
   and when there is nothing indeed in view that should occasion it,
   besides their having indulged themselves, I fear, too much liberty to
   prevaricate in their own minds, and reasonings before, and then they
   think it reasonable to justify error by erring always, by never
   retracting, or by endeavouring to make men believe, that things
   suggested to them as true, are impossible to be true.

LECTURE XIV. [2]

   3. But now to come to the third part of the proposed work, to vindicate
   the truth of this doctrine laid down, in the proposition, as to what is
   objected, and alleged against it, which summarily and generally is but
   this one thing, into which all results; That it is contrary to the
   common reason of men, and such as doth in itself imply a contradiction,
   that three should be but one. And thereupon it is determined by the
   leader of them, Socinus himself, that if any thing do appear to be
   never so plainly contained in Scripture, if yet also it do appear to
   imply a contradiction, or to be contrary to natural reason, any,
   whatsoever violence, ought rather to be put upon the Scriptures than to
   admit it. And this goes therefore, with the men of that way, for a
   principle, that whatsoever seems to be repugnant to their reason, or to
   imply a contradiction, ought to be rejected, though never so plainly
   expressed in Scripture, or contained therein.

   Now first, I shall say here somewhat to this principle in the general,
   by which these men do steer themselves in this, and ail matters of
   religion besides. And then secondly, I shall say somewhat in the
   particular application of it in this case, and shew how very untruly it
   is alleged here, that this is a doctrine repugnant to the common reason
   of man, and which doth carry a contradiction in itself.

   (1.) As to the principle in general, I shall in short say these things
   to it:

   [1.] That if we can be certain, that any thing is repugnant to the
   reason of man, as it is such and doth in itself imply a contradiction,
   it ought to be rejected even in duty to God, and as a piece of homage
   to him. We do owe that homage to our Maker, as the God of truth, to
   reject every thing that we are sure is contrary to the common reason of
   man, which he hath put into him, which is truly and purely reason, and
   which belongs to the Spirit, unto which by the inspiration of the
   almighty God, that understanding is given, which distinguishes him from
   the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the field. We do owe it as a
   homage to the Author of our nature, to reject whatsoever is manifestly
   contrary to that reason, and which is in itself a contradiction. First,
   because he is most confessedly the primum verum, the first truth. And
   as all the beams of the sun, in whatsoever way they do shine to us,
   whether directly, or by never so various refraction, we are sure are
   alt from the sun; so whatsoever rational dictate, that we are most
   certain, or can be sure is such, which we find arrive to us, we cannot
   but be sure that it is from the Father of lights, from whom can issue
   nothing but light; nothing opposite to light or truth: and secondly,
   That it is impossible we can in duty, or as a homage to God, believe a
   contradiction, any thing that carries a contradiction in itself,
   because the highest and primary reason upon which i am to admit any
   thing for truth, is as it is a production of the first truth, as hath
   been told you. But I am certain, the same thing cannot be true and
   false; and therefore, as a deference to God, I cannot have greater
   reason to believe it, than I have to disbelieve it. If it carry a
   contra diction in it, and is pretended to be from God, I cannot believe
   it for any reason, but for the same reason, I am bound to disbelieve
   it. There is not more weight in one end of the scale than there is in
   the other: and so it cannot be believed in that case, as a piece of
   duty unto God: and thereupon, we are as ready to reject every thing, we
   are sure is contradictory and repugnant to a manifest dictate of
   reason, as they can be. But,

   [2.] If any thing be plainly contained and expressed in the word of
   God, that seems repugnant to our reason, we are then certain that the
   seemingness and semblance is false, because we cannot be surer of any
   thing than that God is true, and that he can never be deceived himself,
   nor deceive us: that both verity and veracity are most essential to
   him; and that it is repugnant to his nature, either to be ignorant of
   any thing, or to lie unto us in any thing. And therefore,

   [3.] When there is this competition between any plain words of
   Scripture and a seeming dictate of reason, we are to censure the latter
   by the former, and not the former by the latter: we are to measure the
   rational dictate, by the divine word, and not the divine word by the
   seeming rational dictate. And especially,

   [4.] When that thing is spoken often in Scripture, in the divine word,
   and in varied forms of speech, which have all the same manifest sense
   and meaning, and are not, without the most notorious violence, capable
   of another. And (which will be the ground of this last mentioned
   assertion) when,

   [5.] That word being professedly and declaredly given us as a rare to
   measure our sentiments as well as our practices by. If therefore, we
   should oppose that which seems to us a ration al dictate, to the plain
   expressions of that word, we make that which is to be ruled, the rule;
   we do in that case regulate our rule, and do not admit that the rule
   should regulate us. We judge the law, (as the apostle James's
   expression is, in a case that hath reference to practice, and the case
   is the same in reference to sentiments, and our judgments of things,)
   which is certainly very great insolency: that when God, in compassion
   to the darkness and blindness of our minds, gives us such a rule, a
   light shining in a dark place unto which we are told, we should do well
   to take heed, we should reject this rule, and say, we can do better
   without it, reject this light, and say, we can see better without it.
   As if one should, out of mere good will, offer himself as a guide to a
   bewildered traveller that knows nothing of his way, and this traveller
   should at all turns be controverting with his guide, and say, I know
   the way and how to steer my course better than you; which would be as
   well the highest insolency as ingratitude, supposing that guide to be
   very highly superior and very kindly condescending to do that office in
   such a case. And again,

   [6.] There is yet the more ground for this, when there is among men,
   and even among wise, and learned, and rational men, a very great
   division about what is a rational dictate in this case, and what is
   not. This makes the determination which I have given, to be so much the
   more reasonable, and makes the pretence on the other hand so much the
   more absurd, that that should be given for a dictate of common reason
   wherein most rational men do disagree, at least, therein, as rational
   men as these pretenders, are of a quite contrary mind: and that cannot
   be so clear a dictate of common reason, where in even the most rational
   men do disagree, and sure then, in that case, one would be glad to be
   determined by a divine word. And I add,

   [7.] That the reason of man, in this our present state, even in things
   of much inferior concernment, is very dubious and uncertain, in matters
   wherein religion is not concerned, and so wherein the minds of men are
   not apt to be perverted by ill inclination, as in the matters of
   religion they are. For though it be very true, that it is natural for
   men to be of some religion yet it is as true and as evident, that there
   is an aversion and antipathy in the minds and spirits of men against
   true religion, against sincere, living religion. And if the reason of
   man be a very dubious, uncertain thing, even when there is nothing to
   bias one this way or that, as it is in thousands of instances that
   might be given most apparently; much more cause have we in matters of
   religion, and of this nature, not to over attribute unto it. In
   philosophical matters, wherein men's minds cannot, through prejudice be
   swayed this way or that, and wherein it is no one's interest that this
   side be true rather than that side, yet there are the greatest
   difficulties imaginable in determining what is reason and what not,
   what is true and what not, as all the controversies in philosophy do
   shew: and some, wherein it is the hardest matter imaginable, even to
   the greatest wits that have ever been in the world, to free themselves
   from the appearance of contradiction, which side soever they had in the
   controversy. As it is most notorious, to any that know any thing in
   philosophy, about the compositum continuum, whether the continuum, that
   is, a body doth consist of parts always divisable, or of indivisable
   parts; so that bring it to the minutest thing imaginable, even if it be
   to the breadth of a hair, whether it be still perpetually divisible or
   indivisible. It is plain, take one side or the other in that question,
   and hitherto all the wits in the world have not found how, freely and
   clearly, to disentangle themselves from contradiction in saying, this
   is al ways divisible; or it is sometimes impossible to be divided any
   further, and the apprehension of that doth (I must acknowledge) greatly
   lower my reverence to that which goes under the notion of a rational
   dictate, when in such a case as that of any, the minutest thing you can
   imagine, even the breadth of a hair, no man shall be able to assert
   either it is always divisible or sometime indivisible, without
   entangling himself in such appearances of contradiction as from which,
   the greatest wits that have ever been, have not been able to shew us
   the way of being extricated. And when there is such a division, even
   among the masters of reason, the highest pretenders to it; this is a
   rational dictate, saith the one side, the quite contrary is a rational
   dictate, saith the other side, even in this very business of the
   Trinity itself: whilst some with loud clamour cry out against it as
   impossible to be, others on the other hand, take upon them to
   demonstrate it to be utterly impossible that it should not be; that
   there could be no creation, no Creator if there were not a Trinity,

   These things being said in reference to that principle in the general,
   I now come,

   (2.) To the application of it to this objection; that is, that this is
   a doctrine, (say some) to common and rational principles,
   contradictious in itself, that three should be one.

   That we may speak to this with the more clearness, we shall--consider
   what it is, from Scripture, we assert concerning this matter, and
   then--shew how unreasonably this is pretended to be repugnant to
   reason, or to imply any thing of a contra diction.

   [1.] What it is we do from Scripture assert in this matter, what we do
   not. For we must distinguish here, between plain Scripture doctrine and
   the bold determinations of some schoolmen. We do not think we are
   obliged to justify every determination of a confident and presuming
   schoolman, as if it were divine writ. But what from Scripture we do
   affirm is, That there are three in the Godhead, that these three are
   some way distinguished from one another, otherwise they could not be
   three, there were no pretence to call them three. We find they have
   distinct names; that is plain--the Father, the Word or Son, and the
   Spirit or the Holy Ghost, over and over. But there must be somewhat of
   distinction among themselves, otherwise there were no pretence to call
   them three, if they were no way distinguishable.

   Again, we do affirm they are so far distinguished from one another as,
   that can be said concerning one which cannot be said concerning the
   other. As when we say, "The Word was made flesh." (which you know the
   Scripture speaks,) the meaning is, not that the Father was made flesh,
   or the Spirit was made flesh, but that the Son was made flesh. When it
   is said, (as it often is,) that the Spirit or the Holy Ghost is sent by
   the Father, or the Son, the meaning is, not that the Father sends
   himself, or that the Son sends himself. Therefore, they are so far
   distinct from one another as, that is said of the one which cannot be
   said of the other. But then, how much greater the distinction is, we
   pretend not to say, because the Scripture doth not say it. Only this we
   do say, We can think of no notion by which they are so fitly
   distinguishable as that of personality, as that of their being distinct
   persons; that we do find plainly said concerning one of them, the
   Father, (who is so called in that Heb. i. 3.) that the Son is the
   express image of his person. So we render the word hypostasis fitly and
   aptly enough. And they being so frequently mentioned together, as we
   find they are, it doth naturally suggest to us, that there should be a
   suppositality. And concerning the personality of the Son too, there is
   no question; but as concerning the Holy Ghost, he being so frequently
   spoken of under the notion He, and, (as was noted to you) the gender
   varied on purpose, contrary to strict grammar, we ought also, to
   conceive of him, under the notion of a person: though at the same time
   (we have told you) it is impossible that the notion of a person should
   be the same with God and amongst men, and that for the reason which
   hath been mentioned to you. Only, we have nothing by which more fitly
   to conceive it, than by this notion. Then, so much as this, being what
   we do affirm and assert to be the doctrine of the Scriptures, and to be
   Scripture in this case, then, I say,

   [2.] This is very unreasonable and pretenceless, to affirm that this is
   contradictious in itself, or any way opposite or contrary to the plain
   dictates of reason. For where should the contradiction lie? It is only
   pretended to lie in this, that the same thing cannot be three and one.
   And it is easily admitted, that the same thing cannot be three and one,
   in the same respect wherein they are but one. But nothing hinders, but
   that the same may be, in different respects, that is, in those respects
   wherein they are three, they are not only one: in that respect wherein
   they are but one, they cannot be three. But, that in divers respects,
   the same thing may be three and one, or that there may be a trinity, a
   triad, in one and the same thing, the instances are so many, so plain
   and so notorious in other inferior things, that it is absurd and
   unreasonable to pretend this to be contradictious, or contrary to the
   dictate of nature. Let us go to the most obvious thing that can be
   thought of. If I should go no further but only to give you an instance
   of this book which I have here in my hand, it hath its breadth, its
   length and its thickness, as you all easily see and apprehend, but its
   breadth is not its length, nor is its length its thickness, neither of
   these are one another, yet all the same book: that is, this thing which
   is so long, so broad and so thick is this book. If we speak of a man,
   he is a very vegetative creature, and he is a sensitive creature, and
   he is a rational and intelligent creature, and yet, it is most plain,
   vegetation is not sensation, nor sensation intellection. The sun, it
   hath belonging to it, light and heat and motion: that luminous body is
   the sun, that califective body is the sun, and that moving body is the
   sun. These three are all but one sun: and yet there are three in it as
   is evident. The world is full of instances of the like nature. We can
   hardly think of any sort of things wherein this may not be exemplified.
   And whereas, the greatest quarrel is about personality, there is
   nothing more plain than that one and the same man may sustain three
   persons, the person of a father, the person of a son, and the person of
   a magistrate, and the like. Many persons may be sustained by one and
   the same man; the notion of person, in the strict and common sense,
   being only taken for the circumstances of their state and condition who
   are spoken of, and not as denoting this or that particular essence; and
   so to be a man, and this or that person is not all one: and so to be
   God, and this or that person in the Godhead is not all one. The same
   man may endure, and may sustentare, may put on, and may bear, several
   persons: and so it is no repugnancy to reason at all that the same God
   do so too. And therefore, this pretence of the irrationality or
   contradictiousness of this doctrine, doth itself want a pretence; there
   can be really no ground for it. And so much hath been so far said, by
   some of the late zealous contenders in this case the other way, that
   they are brought to say and publish, that truly he must be a madman
   that will say there cannot be three persons in the same God. That we
   find published not long ago: so far doth that pretence vanish, that
   this doctrine must be rejected as being irrational and contradictory.
   And if we would take the notion of person and personality, in the most
   strict and scholastic sense, it would be with very great arrogance that
   they must pretend this doctrine (taken even in that sense) to be
   contrary to a common, rational dictate, when as it is so very well
   known first, that the very notion of individuation or personality,
   suppositality, or more generally personality, in reference to rational
   beings, is one of the most disputed things in the world. And how absurd
   is it to say, that this or that is opposite to a common rational
   dictate, about which, (as was said before,) the most learned men, and
   the highest pretenders to reason have constantly disagreed. There must
   first, before this can be said, some one common notion of personality
   and individuation be fixed, which all men must assent to, as soon as
   ever they hear it, that must command assent to it in every man's mind.
   But about these things there is the greatest disagreement, and hath
   constantly been, ever since the name of a schoolman or metaphysician
   hath been known in the world. And then, secondly, besides that, there
   is so great a disagreement among schoolmen and metaphysicians, about
   the notions of suppositality, personality and individuality, that they
   who will conclude this to be against a rational dictate, must be able
   to evince, that the notion of personality must be the same with us and
   with God, which it will be impossible for them ever to evince, and the
   contrary whereof (as hath been said) is demonstrable. That is, were it
   ever so certain that there cannot be three finite persons partaking the
   same finite nature, it will he hence no consequence, that there cannot
   he three infinite persons partaking the same infinite nature, or
   communicating in the same infinite nature: no reason, for a parallel
   cannot be drawn so much as with a plausible pretence, between what is
   finite and what is infinite, in this case.

   But to shut up all that I intend, as to the polemical part of this
   discourse, I shall only leave these few things, which will plainly
   represent to us that this doctrine may be conceived, and hath not that
   difficulty in it which commonly hath been thought. As,

   First. It is out of ail question that God is but one, can be but one.
   And,

   Secondly. That whatsoever is necessarily, is God. Whatsoever is in
   being, from a necessity in nature, is God; than which no principle can
   be plainer. And,

   Thirdly. That whatsoever is by dependance on the divine will, is
   creature; whatsoever is not of necessity, but by mere dependance on the
   divine wilt, that is all creature. "Thou hast created all things, and
   for thy pleasure they are and were created."

   Fourthly. If therefore, we do suppose the Son and the Holy Ghost to be
   from the Father, by a necessity of nature, an eternal necessity of
   nature, and not by dependance upon his will, they will not be
   creatures, because nothing is creature but what depends upon the will
   and pleasure of the Creator. And if they be not creatures, what are
   they then? Then they must be God, and yet both of them from the Father
   too: for all that do assert the Trinity, do acknowledge the Father to
   be fons trinitatis, the fountain of the Trinity: and if from this
   fountain, the Son be one way, and the Holy Ghost be another way, both
   from the Father; that is, the Son from the Father immediately, and the
   Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, and this, not by choice, but by
   an eternal necessity of nature, here is this doctrine as easily
   conceivable as any that I know of whatsoever, that lies not within the
   compass of our manifest demonstration. And my business is not now to
   demonstrate to you that thus it is, but that it is very easily
   conceivable that thus it may be. That is, that the Son and the Holy
   Ghost may be from the Father, and that we are sure they are from him by
   an eternal necessity of nature, and not by choice. It is not by his
   pleasure they are and were, but by eternal necessity of nature they are
   from him as he is originally from himself. That is, they are always and
   eternally in that nature which is self-originate. And here is no
   contradiction, nor the least appearance or shadow of it in all this.

   And thus far now, hath our labour been taken up as to this subject,
   about the truth of it: that is, to prove and to vindicate it. Our next
   business, which only remains, will be about the importance of it, the
   great usefulness of it, and the mighty weight and stress that lie upon
   it. At present I leave this with you, that I know nothing more needful
   to clear our apprehensions, and make our minds very calm and serene, in
   reference to this doctrine of the Trinity than first, high, adoring
   thoughts of God, and secondly, mean thoughts of ourselves. If we can
   but think highly enough of God, and meanly enough of ourselves, and how
   unmeet and incompetent such moles and worms of the earth as we are,
   must needs be to make an estimate of his nature, and how things are
   with him, otherwise than he is pleased graciously and freely to declare
   to us concerning himself, there will be nothing then in all this
   doctrine that we shall stumble at, nothing that we shall receive with
   difficulty, and nothing but what we may receive with great use and
   advantage to ourselves.

LECTURE XV. [3]

   Therefore, now for the importance and use of this doctrine, much may be
   conceived of that, if it be considered how the stamp and impression of
   a Trinity doth run through the world. A noted writer, of our time, hath
   said very much to that purpose, of which I shall say but little. Take
   the whole universe of created beings and you have every where a Trinity
   instamped, It is observable enough in that great triad, the several
   things conceivable under each member, of nature, morality and religion.
   But it is with religion that we are concerned, and wherein the practice
   of it doth principally appear, and is most considerable. Our religion
   you do know, objectively considered, is made up of doctrines to be
   believed, and of duties to be done, and of benefits to be sought, and
   these are comprised in those three noted summaries, the creed, the
   decalogue, and the Lord's prayer. In these three, there is some
   impression and resemblance of the Trinity in the divine nature. That
   is, of that power and of that wisdom and knowledge, and of that
   benignity and love, which are the three great most noted principles we
   have to conceive of, and that we cannot but distinctively conceive of,
   we cannot otherwise conceive of, than as distinct in the simple union
   of the God head; and which may probably enough correspond to, and be
   the very notion of, Father, Son, and Spirit.

   Why now, if we consider doctrinals in the first place, the doctrines
   that do make up the first and most noble part of the scheme of
   religion, you know how they all depend upon, and are reduced to, the
   notions that are given us of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; upon these
   three heads hangs the frame of Christian doctrine. That is, of the
   Father considered as God Creator; and of the Son considered as God
   Redeemer; and of the Holy Ghost considered as God Sanctifier. Which
   three great works of God, though it be true that they do each of them
   owe themselves to the concurrence of each of the persons according to
   that known maxim, opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa: [4] which is
   undoubtedly a true and clear one: yet each of these is appropriated to
   each of the persons severally, not exclusively, but eminently. And that
   we may understand that aright, when it is said, the Father creates, it
   is to be understood eminently, not exclusively, of the Son and the Holy
   Ghost: and so as to the rest. When we profess to believe in God as the
   Creator of heaven and earth, that is, in God the Father, as he is the
   first Fountain of all being, uncreated and created too; why though that
   be plainly said, yet it is as plainly said, that without the Word was
   nothing made; and that by him, that is, the Word, even he--who is said
   to be "the brightness of his Father's glory and the express image of
   his person," the worlds were made: and that they were made by the
   Spirit of his mouth; and that the Spirit did move upon the waters, that
   is, upon the fluctuating chaos, which we must suppose to have been
   first made, before things were made out of it: and that it was first
   made is the most demonstrable thing, in all the world; otherwise, it
   were, itself, a necessary and self original being, and so God; the
   notion of God would not be all-comprehending, or there would be
   something praeter Deum, besides God, originally and naturally, and of
   itself. So again, as to the work of redemption, that was designed by
   the Father, but wrought by the Son, and applied by the Holy Ghost.
   These are plain things and abundantly evident in Scripture as, if I
   should turn from text to text, you would see. But I must suppose you to
   understand it already. You cannot then but see the mighty importance of
   this doctrine of the Trinity in our religion. We shall have occasion to
   press that further by and by. But now hereupon, I shall, for putting a
   period to the discourse on this subject, subjoin several instructions
   in reference hereto. As,

   1 That we should all learn to adore the wonderful divine condescension,
   that he should so far unveil himself, and make known so much of the
   things of his own nature and being, to such despicable beings as we. We
   can never wonder enough at this. Indeed, I have many times considered,
   it is a very instructive thing, that so many of the pagans should
   discover so very reverential thoughts of God, upon this account, and
   under this notion, as they apprehend his Being to be inscrutable,
   unsearchable, as that inscription on one of their temples doth import,
   "I am he that was, and he that is, and he that shall be, and no one
   hath ever unfolded my veil." Such reverential apprehensions, had they
   (however they came by them,) of the inscrutableness and occultness of
   the Divine Being, that there were such arcana, such secrets veiled from
   all eyes, that could never possibly be looked into. Now that God should
   take such poor creatures as any of us are, and let us see so far into
   the veil, that, whereof we could have had no certain apprehensions, if
   he had not told us, how wonderful is it! Though some have made it very
   much their business, (after they had got the hint from Scripture
   concerning the Trinity,) to shew how rational it was; not only to shew
   how consistent it was with reason, (which is a very justifiable
   undertaking and a great piece of right done to our religion,) some
   carry the matter higher, (as I told you,) and undertake to demonstrate
   it to be necessary, and that we cannot conceive of the nature of God,
   and of that great work of his, the creation of the world, in reference
   to one another otherwise. But this is to strain beyond what the
   exigency of the case doth require. It may however, (by that improvement
   I have already made of it too,) serve somewhat to rebuke the proud
   confidence of that sort of men, who represent this doctrine as contrary
   to a common, rational dictate, the common sense and reason of mankind.
   That is most insolently pretended when, as (unless they will assume to
   themselves that there can be no such thing as a rational distate, that
   is not stamped at their mint) I say, unless they would assume that to
   themselves, it must appear very incongruous to pretend that such a
   thing is impossible to be, when others at the same time, (who may for
   ought I know lay as good a claim to that of being the men, and that
   wisdom shall die with them as they can,) should say with so much
   confidence, it is impossible not to be; and that there could be no such
   thing as a Creator and a creation, if it were Dot so.

   But waving this disquisition, since it is most certainly not impossible
   in itself, it is very adorable that God should come, and so graciously
   discover to us that so it is; when we see how useful it is, and how
   expedite a frame of religion it lays open before us: that he should
   discourse to such children, such weaklings as we, at that rate
   concerning his own nature; "I will tell you how things are with me: now
   in the Godhead these are co-existent from all eternity, Father, Son and
   Spirit: and this I would not have hid from you; I would have you to be
   possessed with right notions and apprehensions of my nature thus far,
   that thus it is with me, and in me." You would wonder that a great and
   wise prince should take upon him to discourse his arcana with a
   peasant, a mean, ignorant peasant. But we do not enough wonder at this
   condescension of God, upon this ground, that we do not enough set
   ourselves to consider the distance between God and creatures, and what
   mere nothings we are to him, and that when we have the most exalted
   thoughts that our minds are capable of, concerning any created being
   whatsoever, and then descending to the meanest sort of creatures we can
   think of, the distance is not only greater, but it is still infinitely
   greater between the great God and us. What then have we left to do, but
   to fall down and wonder, fall down and adore, and cry out, "Whence is
   it to us that thou shouldest let us know so much of thyself?" that
   whereas, the things of God are never to be known distinctly, otherwise
   than as the Spirit of God doth reveal them, that Spirit of God should
   be the Author to us, of such a revelation as this, which we have
   contained in the Bible, concerning this great and most important
   mystery.

   2. Let us learn this too, not to think it a small matter, now that we
   are informed that there is in the Godhead, Father, Son and Spirit; that
   all three should so far concern themselves as we find they do, and be
   so constantly concerned as they are about our affairs. If all the
   potentates on earth should concern themselves about the life of one
   single fly, it were not so strange a thing, it were not so great a
   stoop. We should consider with ourselves over and over, What am I? what
   am I, and what is my life, that the eternal Father, and the eternal
   Son, and the eternal Spirit, should all concern themselves from
   eternity about me? And again,

   3. It should further instruct us into this, to fasten the apprehension
   deep in our souls, of the great concernment of the doctrine, that it
   may lie with weight upon us, as a seal that doth not make impression
   unless it be pressed on; that we should endeavour and intend more to
   press on this doctrine, this truth upon our own souls, that it may make
   the proper, due impression, that we may be delivered up into the mould
   and form of it: as the expression is, Rom. vi. 17. And to that purpose,
   let us bethink ourselves, how miserably (where this doctrine is not
   entertained) the scheme of Christianity, and the Christian religion are
   scattered and torn by the want, or by the denial of it. This
   apprehension should urge us so as that the doctrine should lie with
   greater weight and pressure upon our spirits, because where it is not
   received, away go the great limbs of Christian religion. The Deity of
   the Son of God, that is abandoned and cashiered: well, and what then
   becomes of our religion? Do you not think yourselves concerned in this
   matter? What I Are you willing to venture your souls otherwise than in
   the hands of a Divine Saviour, when you know yourselves to be sinners,
   to be guilty creatures? Do you think it will answer the exigency of
   your case, to have an atonement made for you of no greater value than
   if one mere man were made a sacrifice for another? And if that would
   do, suppose one man were as good as another; why inasmuch as all are
   sinners, when he goes to satisfy another's sin, who shall satisfy for
   his sin? Or how shall he satisfy for his own? And suppose an innocent
   man should be made on purpose (as it is supposed in this present case)
   to be a sacrifice; that is still but man for man. It is true, he hath
   no sin of his own to satisfy for, but suppose he could satisfy for the
   sin of another man, there must then, be as many innocent men created as
   there are guilty men, at that rate. But would not you be loath to
   hazard your souls upon such conceits as these? and to quit your hold of
   a mighty God for your Saviour? of this assurance, that he who is to be
   your Saviour is known by the name of "the mighty God, the everlasting
   Father, and the Prince of Peace?" Would you be content to abandon this,
   that he is to be your Saviour who is God blessed for ever; who before
   the worlds were made was with God; and in time was made flesh, and
   dwelt among us; that word that was with God, and that was God, and by
   which all things were made, without which nothing was made, that was
   made, was made flesh? An amazing thing it is to me, how men that
   pretend to believe the divine authority of the Bible, can disentangle
   themselves from such a place as this, "The Word was made flesh." They
   that will have Jesus Christ never to have been, no such person ever to
   have been, before he was born of the Virgin Mary, I would then know of
   them, "What was that, that was made flesh?" It was the word that was
   made flesh; there was somewhat before this flesh was made, or it was
   nothing, that was made flesh. And every one that understands the
   ordinary use of this expression (flesh) knows it doth not signify the
   person of a man, but the whole of a man, not the body only: for when it
   is said, "in his sight there shall no flesh be justified," what is the
   meaning of that? That the bodies of men shall not be justified? Surely
   not. But thus, from not believing this doctrine, proceeds the denial of
   that great and noble propitiation, once for all made for the sins of
   men, under the proper notion of a propitiation or an expiatory
   sacrifice to atone for sin, and take away guilt. Again hereupon,

   The eternal priesthood of the Son of God is evacuated and reduced to a
   nullity: and all upon this, that an alterity cannot be conceived in the
   Godhead. Not that there is therein, Aliud et aliud, one diverse from
   another, but that there is there personae altera et altera, one person
   distinct from another. But because this is not apprehended, nor will be
   apprehended, therefore, say they, There can be no such thing as a
   propitiatory sacrifice, such as we, such as the Scripture, such as the
   gospel doth most expressly speak of, that is, of him who was God
   offered up unto God. For, say they, There is but one person in the
   Godhead; and a satisfier and a satisfied, must be two persons, there
   must be in such a case an alterity of persons personae altera et
   altera, and so they truly reason. He that doth satisfy and he that is
   satisfied must be two persons: this is most certain, but they, not
   admitting the alterity of persons, therefore exclude the whole
   doctrine. And then,

   That mighty power that is to go forth from the Divine Spirit, for the
   breaking of the bands of iron, and the rescuing of captive souls out of
   the devil's power; to turn men from darkness to light, and from the
   power of Satan unto God, all that is reduced to nothing too. And so
   there is no other Christianity left in the world but a certain sort of
   self-sprung religion: no power but that which I can be the author of to
   myself, what I have of mine own: or else if they will have more, they
   do speak altogether unintelligibly and contrary to the plain sense of
   things: that is, they will not have the Holy Ghost to be a distinct
   person in the Godhead, but (as they call it) the power of God, meaning
   a quality. But I take what hath been said against that, to be truly as
   plain demonstration as can be used in any case whatsoever. The Holy
   Ghost is called the divine power. Comply with them so far, then say I,
   This divine power is either created power or uncreated. If this divine
   power be created, then they must suppose God, while he was without
   power to create power; that is, that God being first impotent, created
   power and became omnipotent. But if they will say, It is an uncreated
   power, then they say what we say: then it is God: the Holy Ghost is
   God. But he is God so as he is capable of being sent, and sent of the
   Father, and so that he must be a distinct person in the Godhead. But
   the stress of all that mighty affair which is to be wrought in the
   souls of men, when they are sanctified; of children of the devil, and
   friends of hell, to be made children of God, and meet to be partakers
   of an inheritance with them that are sanctified, with the saints in
   light: all that mighty work that is to be done by an Almighty Spirit,
   must be proportionally diminished as the cause is diminished, as the
   agent is diminished and reduced, by their doctrine, to a mere creature.
   Therefore, I say, labour to apprehend deeply, the mighty importance of
   this doctrine, and to fix the apprehensions of it, and to have it
   wrought in your souls, that so such a truth may no more be capable of
   being torn away from thence than one faculty of your souls can be torn
   from another. And,

   4. Labour to savour and relish such truth, this truth, this doctrine,
   labour to get the savour and relish of it into your souls; that is, to
   receive this truth in the love of it. It is a matter of dangerous
   importance, when truth of this kind which concerns the vitals of
   religion, is received merely as an airy notion, and is not digested,
   doth not enter and sink deep into our hearts, and that which must
   entertain and admit there: even into the very centre of our souls must
   be the love of it. "They received not the truth in the love of it, that
   they might be saved." 2 Thess. ii. 10. And what became of that matter?
   When they did so lightly adhere to divine truth as one doth to a thing
   that he doth not love, or that is not united to his soul by love, they
   easily suffered their souls to be cheated of it: and then, for their
   not loving this truth, (it being a thing most highly criminal not to
   love divine truth, not to love so great and sacred a thing) God gave
   them up to strong delusions, to believe lies, that they all might be
   damned who received not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
   Such truth they could take no pleasure in, but they could take pleasure
   in unrighteousness. "Let them go." saith God, "the way that the
   inclinations of their own wicked hearts carries them to." There is that
   kindred, that alliance between the soul and truth, that there is a
   violence done to both if they be severed, and if the soul do not
   inwardly love truth, as that which is most nearly allied to it. They
   that are after the Spirit do savour the things of the Spirit, as they
   that are after the flesh do savour the things of the flesh. And this is
   the way to become most stable Christians, when souls and truth come to
   be united and knit together in love, meeting in one and the same common
   centre, and even in this as the centre; as you may see in that place
   which I will recommend to your present perusal, and future serious
   thoughts. Colos. ii. 2. Saith the apostle, "I would, that ye knew what
   great conflict I have had for you, (as he introduceth it to them by
   what he saith in the foregoing verse) that your hearts might be
   comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full
   assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
   God." And what is comprehended in this mystery of God? that is, of the
   Father and of Christ; it is generally expressed first, "the mystery of
   God, "and then particularly, "of the Father and of Christ." The former
   and, is not copulative but exigetical: "To the acknowledgment of the
   mystery of God, and," that is, even, or to wit, of the Father and of
   Christ. That is, the mystery of God doth comprehend these two. The Holy
   Ghost is not always mentioned, being expressly enough so in many other
   texts. But here is the very sum of our religion in this mystery, "the
   mystery of God." to wit, "of the Father and of Christ;" two particular
   expressions including the general one, from both which, (as other
   scriptures sufficiently instruct us,) the Holy Ghost issues forth, as
   the great and mighty Agent to accomplish all the great things, which by
   Christian religion are to be effected in the world. And this was the
   apostle's deep concern on the behalf of these christians. "You cannot
   imagine," saith he, "what conflict I have about these things; that you
   might be strong christians:" and how? "That you may be knit together in
   love, unto the riches of the full assurance of understanding," all
   loving together, all agreeing together to love the same truths, the
   same doctrines, and thereby to have it incorporated, inwrought into
   you, that you may be able to say, "I can as soon suffer limb to be torn
   from limb, as suffer such truth as this to be torn away from my soul:"
   that that is to be bought and never to be sold, never to be parted with
   on any terms, "What! part with that? or be indifferent towards that? or
   let my mind hover or be in suspense? why it is my very life, my life
   lies here: shall I in the midst of a tempestuous sea, being safely
   brought to a firm and stable rock, quit my rock and go to floating
   again amidst the raging waves?" So will any man reckon in this matter,
   that hath any care or concern for his soul. Again,

   5. You may hence learn, how we are to eye God in our transacting the
   great business of covenanting with him; that is, as God the Father, God
   the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; which that initial seal of the
   covenant doth plainly enough dictate, when we are required to be
   baptised in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy
   Ghost. When I enter into covenant with God to take him for my God, if I
   am first solemnly to do it yet; or if I am with solemnity, from time to
   time, to renew my covenant, we must consider how we are to do it; we
   must not think of taking God abstractly or taking one person alone. But
   we must take God the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost
   for our God. Do not think your baptism signifies nothing, when it is
   directed to be administered in that order, in the name of the Father,
   the Son and the Spirit. So you are to consider with yourselves, "I am
   to be a devoted one, I am a devoted one, and must continue so, to God
   the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost." A wonderful thing
   that we should be a congregation of such persons dwelling on earth, who
   have these names named upon us, that such a claim should be laid from
   heaven to us, I claim every one of you for mine, for mine, saith the
   Father, you were baptized in my name; and so the rest. Why should we
   not walk up and down this world with this sense on our minds, with this
   thought often renewed, often impressed upon us?

LECTURE XVI. [5]

   6. It lets us see how we are to understand the relation that results
   from such a covenant between God and us, whereby we become related to
   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, and they become
   related to us: you have heard under what distinct notions, principally,
   but not exclusively, each of the persons is related to us. The Father
   as Creator, not excluding the Son and Spirit: the Son as Redeemer, not
   excluding the Father and Spirit, the Spirit as Sanctifier, not
   excluding the Father and Son. We have shewn you concerning each of
   these, that creative power (according as the Scripture teacheth us to
   conceive) is from the Father, as the Fountain, through the Son as the
   way of its conveyance, (in respect whereof some speak of a natural
   mediatorship belonging unto the Son of God before the ordinate one) and
   by the agency of the Holy Ghost, who is represented as the immediate
   Agent in all the operations of God towards the creature, whether in the
   sphere of nature or of grace. And we are to look upon the Son as under
   the notion of the Redeemer, but so as to understand that this
   redemption; was designed by the Father, and is applied by the Holy
   Ghost; and upon the Holy Ghost as the Sanctifier, and yet still to
   understand that this his sanctifying work was predetermined by the
   Father, procured by the Son, and effected by himself. When therefore,
   we are to consider God as related to us as our God, ("this God is our
   God, he will be our guide even unto death") we must take in and bring
   together each of these notions, and conceptions concerning him; we must
   take in the conceptions of each of the persons, "God the Father, God
   the Son, and God the Holy Ghost is my God." Somewhat agreeable to what
   the ancient philosopher saith, concerning relatives, Relata sunt quorum
   totum esse est ad aliud; that is, relatives are such things, the whole
   of which appertains to another. Why so? All that is conceivable in the
   Divine Being is, in this case, all to us. The fulness of God is to be
   considered with relation to us so far as is needful, so far as we are
   capable: he doth not reserve himself from us in any thing of it. How
   admirable a thing is this! How great and high thoughts ought we to have
   concerning the privilege state of our case I Indeed, there is nothing
   that we have to consider of this God, or to look after the knowledge
   of, to answer the curiosity of a vain mind; but every thing or any
   thing that may answer the necessity of a perishing soul, of a soul that
   must otherwise be miserable and lost. Whatsoever is requisite to our
   real felicity and blessedness, we may look to all that is in God as
   determined by a special relation unto us. "As I am such (saith God) I
   am such entirely yours, all for you, wholly yours." Therefore, did the
   everlasting covenant that comprehends and conveys all this, yield such
   solace to the soul of dying David, 2 Sam. xxiii. 5. "Thou hast made
   with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure, for
   this is all my salvation and all my desire." I care for nothing beyond
   this.' The great thing that the covenant doth convey, is God: and by
   it, it is, that God the Father, Son and Spirit do become related to us
   as ours, if once we do take hold of the covenant, if once we put in our
   claim, and do but lay the ground by that act of oar own interest: our
   claimable interest doth depend upon that; that very act of taking,
   accepting, "laying hold" as the expression is in that 56 Isaiah, for
   the encouragement of poor strangers that might possibly apprehend they
   were quite cut off from God. "No, let the sons of the strangers that
   take hold of my covenant encourage themselves; that makes me theirs: I
   am theirs, if they do but lay hold; it is but take and have," as
   afterwards, in this" chapter where the text is, it is said concerning
   the Son especially, "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath
   not the Son hath not life." And he hath him who hath once taken him.
   Again,

   7. This serves specially to instruct us concerning our application to
   God in prayer. That is, that we must still comprehend in our thoughts,
   Father, Son, and Spirit together; the Father, Word, and Holy Ghost, as
   it is expressed in the text. I know and have particularly understood
   from some, that they have been full of dubious, perplexing thoughts,
   how to steer aright in their applications to God, making their solemn
   ad dresses so as to run into neither of those things which they have
   pretended to have been, both of them, their fear and confusion: on the
   one hand, by not ascribing distinctly to each of the persons what they
   should; or blasphemy on the other hand, by ascribing what was not due;
   what was not to be ascribed. But our way is very plain, if we do but
   consider what the Scriptures say concerning these three substances in
   the Godhead, and what copies it sets us of applying ourselves hereupon.
   That is, to the eternal Father, through the eternal Son, by the eternal
   Spirit; so we ought to apply ourselves, and here is nothing to lead us
   into confusion or indistinction of thoughts in so doing. It is plain we
   have the Father always represented as the original Foundation of all
   light, all life, all being, all excellency, all perfection, whether
   created or uncreated. He is then a most adequate terminative Object of
   our worship in such application and supplication. We go properly to the
   Fountain of all good. Whither should we go else? But he is (especially
   to those that have been in delinquency and transgression) inaccesible:
   we need a mediator: there could no mediator answer the exigency of our
   case, that was not God as well as man: we need a Divine Mediator, a God
   Mediator, we cannot expect that God should do any thing for us but for
   the sake of God, or for his sake who was God: so we are always taught
   to apply ourselves, to direct our addresses: and so we are to expect
   the answers of them: that is, that prayer must ascend through Christ,
   and that blessings are to descend through him. "Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus, who has blessed us with all spiritual
   blessings in heavenly places," through him. Eph. i. 3. And we are to
   suppose that whatsoever is done for us, in answer to our prayers, when
   they are accepted, it must be by the agency of the Holy Ghost. The
   state of our case is such, as to require an infinite almighty Agent to
   work in us, and to work for us, the things that are necessary to our
   present support, and to our final blessedness. And we are hereupon,
   taught by our Lord himself, in respect to the final and terminative
   Object of such worship, (that of prayer for instance) to pray unto the
   Father; "Our Father which art in heaven"--so we are taught to pray. "I
   bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Ephes. iii. 14.
   Yea, and so our Lord Jesus Christ did pray himself: "I will pray the
   Father and he shall give you another Comforter." John xiv. 16. "Father
   forgive them; for they know not what they do." Luke xxii. 24. And to
   him he renders solemn acknowledgment by way of thanksgiving. "I thank
   thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth." Matth. xi. 25. And when he
   did so, (as we find his was a very praying life, in the days of his
   flesh, here in this world,) it is very vainly and foolishly alleged
   that then he must, according to our doctrine and notion, be supposed to
   pray to himself: it is a very vain and idle pretence. And so I find
   indeed, that the arguments of that sort of adversary, that is, they
   that do impugn the divinity of the Son of God, tend to prove,
   generally, nothing but that which we never deny, that is, that Christ
   was man. This is the thing that by many arguments they set themselves
   most industriously to prove, which none of us deny, that Christ was
   man. Who doth doubt it? But they would thence conclude that because he
   is man, therefore he could not be God; which is their absurd and
   foolish consequence, when we know it was so plainly, so very plainly
   said, that the Word which, in that text, is said to be with God, is
   also said to be God: and the same Word is said to be made flesh, to be
   incarnate, to have assumed and taken on flesh: that is, not as if it
   did, in becoming flesh, cease to be what it was before, but did only
   add an assumed nature to a divine; and therefore, there being two
   natures now meeting together in that one person, it was no way
   unintelligible, but that he should do that in the one nature which was
   impossible he should do in or by the other. That is, as man he did
   grow, and as a man he did die, and as man he did pray, when as God he
   could do none of these. But he that was God did do these things, though
   not as he was God. He that was God, did lay down his life, as in that
   3rd. chapter of this epistle, verse 16. "Hereby perceive we the love of
   God, that he" (that same he that was God) "laid down his life for us."
   And so he that was God, shed his blood for us. Acts xx. 28. "Feed the
   flock of God (his church) which he hath purchased with his own blood;"
   his own, who was God; though as God, we know he could neither bleed nor
   have blood. But whereas, the Son of God, as he was the Son of God and
   God, did pray, and praying, apply himself to the Father, so are we to
   do, to pray, and in praying, apply ourselves to the Father as we are
   led by that great example. But then, we being nothing but creatures, we
   have the whole Deity in view as the Object of our worship and
   addresses. But not the Deity, abstractly considered, but the Deity as
   subsisting in these three persons. The Deity abstractly considered, in
   the case of our Lord himself, was neither the Object, nor the Subject
   of prayer; God, as God, did neither pray nor was prayed unto by him;
   did not pray, for it was the man, the man Christ that prayed; nor
   abstractly, nor merely as God, was he the Object of prayer: but as the
   Godhead did subsist in the person of the Father, so did the man Christ
   apply himself to him, and so could in no sort be said to pray to
   himself, in praying to him. But now, I say, we who are nothing but
   creatures, we have the entire Godhead, not abstractly, but as
   subsisting in three persons, to apply ourselves unto, and those persons
   conceived of, according to the order they are represented to stand
   towards one another, and to be related one to another. As we told you
   already, when we pray to the Father, as the final and terminative
   Object of our prayers, we are at the same time, to conceive the Son as
   through whom the prayer is to be transmitted, together with the answer,
   the good we are to expect and pray for: and the Holy Ghost, as by whose
   power to pray, and by whose power the answer of prayer is to be
   effected too. And so it is God that our prayers must respect, God to
   whom, God through whom, and God by whom. Pray to God, through God and
   from God, and so our prayer hath every way to do with God. Our prayer,
   as it is to be through the mediation of Christ, so both it and its
   answer are to be wrought by the Holy Ghost: we are in that great and
   sacred work of praying, to deliver up ourselves to the conduct of the
   Holy Ghost, and so we are to do in the whole of our course. "As many as
   are the sons of God they are led,'' oracled (as that word signifies,
   Rom. viii. 14) "by the Spirit of God." Which Spirit is a Spirit of
   adoption, (as it afterwards follows,) the Spirit that belongs to the
   state of worship, as they are sons, that teaches them to cry "Abba
   Father." And because they are sons, he hath sent the Spirit of his Son
   into their hearts, as it is said in that parallel place. Gal. iv. 6.
   And we are required to pray alway in the Spirit. Ephes. vi. 18. And in
   the Holy Ghost: 20th verse of the epistle to Jude. "Praying in the Holy
   Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
   Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."

   Put all this together, and then every prayer of ours, ought to respect
   each person in the Godhead. That is, it ought to be to God, through
   God, and from God: even as the answer, it is to be in the same order,
   originally God's answer, through Christ, and by the Holy Ghost. And so
   we run into no confusion, when we suffer ourselves to be governed by
   Scripture light. And we can be in no danger of incurring the guilt of
   blasphemy: for we do not ascribe to any of these persons more than the
   Scripture doth plainly teach us to ascribe. And as our Saviour saith
   concerning himself, so may we concerning each of these persons: when
   the Scripture saith so and so, and doth attribute such and such things
   to them, will any one say, that he blasphemes that saith, that the
   eternal Father is God, or the eternal Son is God, or the eternal Spirit
   is God? Scripture most expressly saying these things as words can speak
   them. And again,

   8. This should further teach us how to steer our whole course in this
   world: our business here on earth, ought to be (in the main of it)
   religion: we ought to make religion our business. The business of
   religion, while we are in this imperfect state, is only a motion
   Godward. The religion of the way, is coming to God. So that any one who
   is sincerely religious and Godly, will be able to make answer to this
   question, What is the main business of your life? This true answer he
   can make, "My main business is to make towards God, I am aiming at God,
   tending towards God, as one that hath been removed and set at a
   distance from him, and so am to be brought back to him." It was this,
   Christ died for, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God. Now this
   being the state of our case, we are distant from him, in nearness to
   whom consists our duty and felicity. When we are to take and direct our
   course Godward, we must have a final term for our motion: "Whither are
   you going?" "Why my course is tending and directed Godward." This
   motion must have for its ultimate term, God the Father. This is the
   sense and language of an inquiring soul, when once it comes to
   understand what the Scripture doth so plainly reveal; that there are in
   the Godhead, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Their sense, I say, is what we
   find expressed, John xiv. 8. "Shew us the Father and it sufficeth us:"
   "do but shew us the Father, and we have enough: our great inquiry is
   after the Father, the Fountain and Original of all things, in whom is
   our life and our only hope." "Well," saith our Saviour (meeting that
   genius and sense of such an inquirer) "I know where you would be, and
   who you are seeking: and have you so long known me, and are ignorant of
   the Father? Come, I will be your Conductor, I will be your Guide, no
   man cometh to the Father but by me." And therefore, as there must be a
   final term of this motion, so there must be a way leading thereto.
   "Why, ] am the way, the truth and the life, (John xiv. 6.) no man
   cometh unto the Father, but by me." What is considerable in all motion,
   is especially considerable in this. In every motion there must be a
   final term, and there must be a way to move in. The Father, he is the
   final term--the Son, he tells us, he is the way. But then there must be
   a third thing, there must be an acting, moving principle besides, and
   that must be the Holy Ghost, and can be no other. It is by that one
   Spirit that all who shall approach to God must have access to him, even
   to him the Father, considered under the notion of the Father. Jews and
   Gentiles have been wont (as that was the noted distinction) to divide
   the world. Now we find both spoken of in the same context, Ephes. 2.
   His business was to make them nigh who were afar off. The Gentiles were
   afar off, the Jews were comparatively nigh: now Christ was to make them
   nigh too, and both of them were to have access by one and the same
   Spirit to the Father: from the 13th to the 18th verse. Whoever have a
   mind to return, to come back to God, (from whom, in the common
   apostacy, all have made a defection and cut themselves off,) here is
   the course and method of their procedure, they must propound to
   themselves God the Father, (the Fountain of all life and blessedness)
   to whom they must come, to whom they must be bending and directing
   their course, and to whom they must guide their course in the way he
   hath prescribed, and that is, by his own Son: "No man cometh to the
   Father (saith our Saviour) but by me." And they must be acted on in
   this way towards that final term and end, by the power of the Holy
   Ghost. There can be no motion without the concurrence of such a third,
   unto which there is a correspondency here. That is, no man can move,
   but he moves some whither towards some term, nor can he move, but it
   must be in some way. Nor again, can he move but it must be from some
   motive principle, that carries him through this way to that end. And so
   you may easily represent to yourselves the business of your lives here
   in this world. My business is from day to day, to tend towards the
   eternal Father by the eternal Son and under the conduct and influence
   of the eternal Spirit. These are obvious and useful instructions, in
   reference to the doctrine that hath been opened to you from the text,
   that do more directly concern and relate to the subject we have thus
   far been upon.

   But there is somewhat else, in reference to the present purpose, upon
   this subject, which is collateral, and will be of use to us, however,
   to take notice of too. Our great design upon this text, was to observe
   to you, that there are such a three in the Godhead; three and no more,
   as we have observed and insisted, of one certain order, Father, Son,
   and Spirit, that do subsist in the Godhead, which is but one. But the
   apostle doth here not only take notice what they are, that are thus in
   heaven, but what also they do, how they are employed, amidst the glory
   of the heavenly state. And he tells us they "bear record in heaven: the
   Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one." You see
   who the witnesses are, in the words of the text, and may see, a little
   lower, what is the matter of their testimony, (as I was hinting to you
   but now) that is, in sum, the truth of the Christian religion, or the
   whole constitution of the Mediator. This is the record, (as it is
   presently subjoined) that God hath given us eternal life, and that this
   life is in his Son. He hath an infinite fulness of life to convey, to
   communicate, and to diffuse through a desolate world, a world lost in
   death and darkness. And how is it to be conveyed? in what way is it to
   be communicated? Why it is all treasured up in his Son, he hath
   constituted and appointed a Mediator, that in him it might be
   deposited, and that by him and through him, it might be transmitted and
   made to diffuse itself, and flow amongst lost and perishing souls. This
   was the matter of this testimony. Why let us take so much of
   instruction from hence,

   That since those Three glorious Three that are in heaven, are bearing
   record to the truth of our religion, of Christianity, that is, that God
   hath a design to communicate life to lost and perishing souls, and hath
   treasured up that life in order to this communication in his Son: since
   this is their record, their testimony, I pray let us take care that we
   duly receive it. Be afraid of slighting that testimony, the matter
   whereof, is of so great importance to ourselves, and the Authors
   whereof, are the three glorious Persons in the Godhead, so venerable
   and so great Ones. When they are said to bear record in heaven, or to
   testify in heaven, the meaning is, not that, their testimony is
   performed in heaven terminative, but originaliter, that is, these
   witnesses do testify from heaven, concerning this matter which is of so
   great importance to the sons of men on earth. And pray see that we
   receive their testimony, as after it follows; If the testimony of a man
   (who is of any credit) ought not to, be slighted; the testimony of God
   is greater. We have the testimony of God the Father, God the Son, and
   God the Holy Ghost, concerning this one thing, that there is a design
   of saving sinners, and giving life to them through his Son, and that
   this life is only in this way to be communicated and conveyed to
   perishing and undone souls: what an awe should this lay upon our souls
   that are perishing! And it is to us, that this salvation is offered.
   They are dead themselves, as the apostle's expression is, "You are
   dead, but your life is hid with Christ in God." This being the state of
   our case, tremble at the thought of slighting such a record, such a
   testimony, that proceeds from these three great Witnesses that do bear
   record in heaven. That is, the Father testifies concerning his Son,
   "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased:" The Son, that
   eternal Word, testifying concerning the man to whom he united himself,
   replenishing that man with a divine glory, so as that glory descending
   from heaven, and accompanying him in his descent from heaven, shone
   visibly in him as the glory of the only begotten Son of the Father,
   full of grace and truth. For he, at the same time when, after his
   descent, he had united himself with flesh is said to be the Son of Man,
   who came down from, and who is in, heaven. John iii. 13. He was
   therefore, testifying from heaven, and was actually in heaven, when
   also he was actually united with this man on earth. And the Holy Ghost,
   he testifying from heaven, by descending on this same man, in visible
   glory like a dove and lighting upon him. Thus, here was God the Father,
   testifying from heaven, and the eternal Word testifying, and the ever
   blessed Spirit testifying, from heaven, and their testimony meeting all
   in one point, namely, that Christ the Mediator is he by whom life is to
   be conveyed from the God of all grace unto undone, perishing, lost
   souls.

   And consider in reference to this further, that as this is a testimony
   to us, it is our concernment, and is incumbent on us so to comport
   ourselves as that it may finally prove a testimony for us, and not a
   testimony against us. This testimony is directly to us, that is, that
   this is God's appointed way for saving lost souls and bringing of them
   to life and blessedness, and consequently, according as the design of
   this testimony is comported with or not, it will be either for us or
   against us. For us, if it can be recorded at last concerning us, such
   and such have had the gospel preached unto them, Christ hath been
   offered, God hath been offering himself in Christ; and they have obeyed
   the gospel, they have complied with the call, they have received the
   Son of God. Oh! how great a thing would it be to have a record in
   heaven for that? How did Job solace himself in this, "My record is in
   heaven." When you can appeal to the records in heaven touching
   transactions between God and you, and you can say, "Lord, thou didst
   make an offer to me of thy Son, thou didst require me to receive him as
   my Lord and Saviour; I have done so, I appeal to thee whether it be not
   recorded above, let the records of heaven be searched, see, whether I
   be not recorded a believer, one that hath resigned up my soul to God in
   Christ by the power of the eternal Spirit, to be entirely and
   absolutely his for ever. O! how blessed a thing will it be to have such
   a record in heaven concerning you and for you? He that knows all things
   knows that such a one hath received Christ in truth, such a one hath
   truly believed, such a one loves the Lord Jesus in sincerity."

   And how fearful, by consequence, will it be to have it recorded in
   heaven against you "So long, so many days, so many years hath such a
   one lived under the gospel,--so often hath a Christ been tendered to
   him, and been refused by him, and there he stands in the records of
   heaven, a refuser of the grace of God, refuser of his Christ, despiser
   of the great salvation, that hath been published and proclaimed and
   "begun to be spoken by the Lord himself, and was confirmed by them that
   heard him, God bearing them witness by divers miracles and gifts of the
   Holy Ghost."

   And besides, that we are thus to take notice of what is doing above;
   how these Three employ themselves, their bearing record in heaven,
   consider too (and therewith I shall shut up all) where it is that this
   work is doing, that these Three are bearing this record in heaven. Let
   us consider a little, and take this instruction from it, that it very
   ill becomes us to alienate ourselves from heaven and disregard the
   affairs and concerns of heaven. For we find that our affairs and
   concernments who dwell on earth are minded in heaven. In heaven there
   is a concern about such poor, wretched creatures as we upon earth. It
   is very unworthy dealing if we live here upon earth, groveling in the
   dust of it, and very seldom think any thought of heaven. When, in
   heaven, by that glorious Triad above, we see our concernments while we
   are upon earth are not forgotten, are not disregarded. These great and
   glorious Ones in heaven, are taken up about our affairs. Sure it should
   provoke us to look upwards much and often, adoringly. It should suggest
   from time to time this thought to us, that the intercourse between
   heaven and earth is not cut off. Still (as abject creatures as we are
   in this our low estate) these glorious persons above are concerned
   about us. Certainly, it should be often considered by us, that we have
   mighty attractives to draw our minds and thoughts upwards, God the
   Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost still bearing a record from
   heaven to us about things that are of the greatest and highest
   concernments for us to mind.

   And it should, in fine, provoke us to have aspirings upwards, towards
   the blessedness and perfection of the heavenly state. In heaven, these
   three bear record, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. Who can
   think of this, and not say, "O that I were there! O that I were there!
   Then will this glorious mystery of the Trinity lie open to my view." It
   is in that seat of the divine glory that these Three are performing
   this kind office towards the poor children of men, even amidst the
   light and glory of the heavenly state. The time will come that we may
   hope to ascend, and be caught up into this region of light, and in that
   light to see light, so that as whatsoever is dark and obscure and
   unknown, and unrevealed, concerning this glorious Three and One, will
   be done away. When once we ascend and get up thither into the regions
   of light and bliss, where the glory of the Eternal Being doth display
   itself, we shall then know as we are known: we cannot know now but in
   part, and see but in part, but we shall then know perfectly and fully,
   and as we are known; so far as the capacity of created nature can
   admit. O! how pleasant should our aspiring upward to these Three be,
   where they do thus testify and bear record. How often should we be
   directing our thoughts and spirits, and the longing of our souls
   towards these regions of light and bliss, saying within ourselves,
   "When shall a period be put to the time of my converse with bats and
   moles in this base earth? when shall I hear the divine voice from the
   throne of glory that shall say to me, Ascend and come up hither, and
   see the things whereof thou hast hitherto but heard by the hearing of
   the ear?"

VI. The Attributes and Perfections of the Divine Being
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE XVII. [6]

   Matt. v. 48.

   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect.

   NEXT to the doctrine of the Trinity, comes (according to proper
   theological order) that of the Divine Attributes or Perfections, most
   fitly to be considered. After the discourse of the Trinity which we
   have showed you subsists in the God head, we have chosen this text,
   both as it serves to confirm, and as it serves to regulate, that
   foregoing doctrine.

   First, As it serves to confirm it. For when we are so plainly told that
   "there are three that bear record in heaven;" and that the great Object
   of our religion, and whereto we are most solemnly to be devoted, is
   represented to us as three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost;
   supposing such a triad as you see in the Godhead, you can suppose it
   under no other notion than that of a very great and high perfection
   belonging thereunto. And that, therefore, it must greatly intrench upon
   the perfection of the Godhead, and unspeakably diminish it, if there
   should be any attempt or offer made to diminish and detract from that
   sacred number. It could not but be a horrid maim to the very Object of
   our religion: and against any such disposition thereunto, or to do any
   thing, or to admit of any thought into our minds that may have that
   tendency, it would fortify us greatly, to have the belief well fixed in
   our minds of the perfection of the Godhead. And,

   Secondly, It serves to regulate that doctrine of the Trinity too: that
   is, to direct us to understand it so as may consist with the other
   perfections of the Godhead; where we are sure it is impossible there
   can be any war, or that there should not be the highest and most
   perfect agreement. We must so conceive of the Trinity in the Godhead,
   and the perfections that we are here and elsewhere taught to ascribe
   unto it, as that these may manifestly accord with one another. And for
   that purpose, we must conceive of the divine perfections as the
   Scripture doth direct us, according as God himself speaks of them;
   allowing his word to be our measure, in making our estimate and
   judgment concerning them. They that take another course, and pretend to
   discover to us the incomprehensible nature of God, by methods and
   measures of theirs' secluding this, and opposing it in any kind, truly
   we have a great deal more reason to be astonished at their confidence
   than we have to admire their knowledge; as if they could make a better
   discovery and a clearer representation of God to us than he himself.
   But if we do understand the divine perfections according to those plain
   and express measures which he hath given us in his word, or which he
   enables us to collect, as we are reasonable creatures, from what he
   hath said in his word concerning himself and them, it would then
   withhold us from any such exorbitant conceptions concerning the Trinity
   of persons in the Godhead, as shall not be easily reconcileable with
   the doctrine of his perfections, according as he hath represented and
   stated it himself.

   And upon that account, shall we apply ourselves to consider so much
   concerning the perfections of the Godhead, as this scripture will give
   us a general ground for. Indeed to speak of the several perfections and
   attributes that do belong to the Divine Nature, distinctly and at
   large, would be the work of a life's time; and very little agree with
   what I have designed, the expounding and opening to you the principles
   of religion, in as short a time as I can. Therefore, I have pitched
   upon this text, designing to sum up ail under it, which I think
   requisite to say concerning the excellencies and perfections of the
   Divine Being, which we commonly speak of under the name, his at
   tributes. You may take the ground of discourse thus,

   That all the excellencies which are requisite to make up the most
   absolute perfection, belong as attributes to the nature of God; or as
   so many attributes to be ascribed to God. This, some may possibly
   apprehend will be but to do what hath been done already, and to do it
   over again. That is, when in proving to you the existence of the Deity,
   we shewed that we are to conceive of him under the notion of a Being
   absolutely perfect. It is true, it was impossible to demonstrate his
   existence without forelaying that notion of God. And that is suitable
   to what the laws of method do require, in treating of any subject
   whatsoever. That is, if there be occasion to put the question an sit,
   whether such a thing be or not and to prove the existence of it, first,
   and before we come to that inquiry, to inquire quid sit, and what it
   is. To open the nature of such a thing, there must be first some
   general notion assigned and laid down of that whose existence we would
   prove, and about which the first inquiry was made an sit, whether it be
   yea or nay. Otherwise, in attempting to prove that, we may as well
   prove any thing else, if we do not give such a notion of it as will
   distinguish it from another thing.

   But now after we have done so, it comes properly of course then, to
   proceed to a more narrow inspection into the nature of such a thing.
   And so the order of tractation did require it should be in this present
   case. That is, when we were to in quire concerning the existence of the
   Deity, first to put you in mind, what you and all must be supposed to
   apprehend concerning the thing we inquired about, that is, a Being of
   absolute perfection in the general: and we can have no other notion of
   God but as a Being absolutely perfect. That being done, and it having
   been evinced to you that there is such a Fountain-Being from whence
   whatsoever perfections we do be hold, and come under our notice among
   the creatures, must have descended and been derived, inasmuch as
   whatsoever we behold, and take notice of, that comes under any notion
   of perfection with us at all, is not nothing, and therefore could not
   come from nothing, and therefore must be first in a fountain from
   whence it came. When by this means, I say, we have plainly evinced,
   that there is one Being which hath all perfection originally in itself;
   and thereupon shewn that Being to be a fit Object for religion, and to
   be worshipped by us, and to whom duties and exercises of religion ought
   to be performed, and that this can be done acceptably no way but
   agreeable to his own will; thereupon we were put upon an inquiry, how
   that will of his might be understood and known: and having found that
   it was discovered (with that design and to that purpose that he might
   be duly and acceptably worshipped) in that word that bears his name,
   thence we come regularly and of course, to speak of things particularly
   and more expressly concerning him (whereof we have had some general
   notions before) which are contained in this Book, and which this word
   will help us to a more distinct knowledge of. And therefore now, in
   speaking to the proposition laid down, we are to consider the subject
   of it: "your heavenly Father," and then we are to consider the thing
   affirmed concerning this subject: He "is perfect."

   I. For the former, the subject of this affirmation, we must consider in
   what sense (as there will be occasion to take notice of by and by) he
   can be spoken of under the name of a subject. Scholars know how to
   distinguish between a subject of predication, and a subject of
   inhæsion. He can be no subject of inhæsion, as you will see presently.
   But a subject concerning which, this or that may be affirmed or spoken,
   that is the only thing which we can truly and properly mean when we
   speak of God under that name or term. But whereas he is here mentioned
   as our "Father which is in heaven," (as our Saviour directs be should
   be prayed unto, in that comprehensive system of petitions that he
   himself was pleased to give his disciples, "Our Father which art in
   heaven,") we must distinguish between Christ's calling him Father
   himself and his teaching us to call him so, or his speaking of him as
   our Father. When Christ himself calls him "Our Father," he calls him so
   as he was: and so he doth speak himself, when he speaks of his having
   come from, his having descended from the Father. He could mean by the
   term "Father," nothing else but the first person in the Trinity. But
   when he speaks of him as our Father and directs us so to speak of him,
   or to speak to him, we do not need so to limit that term "Father," in
   reference to us, for we may fitly enough consider the whole God in the
   paternal relation to ourselves. Concerning the Father there is no
   doubt, for so our Saviour hath taught us to conceive and speak, "I go
   to my Father and your Father, My God and your God," John xx. 17. And
   even the Son is spoken of as our "everlasting Father." Isaiah ix. 6.
   And all the children of God are said to be born of his Spirit, and to
   be begotten thereby. John iii. 1. And suppose we should look upon
   Father, here, strictly as a personal name or title, yet so we must
   consider the Divine Nature as subsisting fontaliter, or as in a
   fountain in that person: and it is that person as having that nature
   eminently and originally and firstly in him; even that same nature that
   is common to each of the persons. And so it is not the person as the
   person, but as having the Divine Nature in it, which is the subject
   here spoken of. "Your Father which is in heaven is perfect." The
   Godhead or the nature of God subsisting as in the Fountain, in the
   Father: and that same nature which is also common with him to the Son
   and to the Holy Ghost. But then,

   II. For that which is affirmed or spoken of this subject, He "is
   perfect." How are we at a loss when we come to speak of this divine
   perfection! "I have seen an end" (saith the Psalmist) "of all
   perfection, but thy commandments are, or thy commandment is exceedingly
   broad." Even so much of divine perfection as is expressed that one way
   (in the divine word) is of so exceeding vast a latitude as to represent
   itself as the matter of the highest wonder to a very enlarged and
   comprehensive mind, that had exceeded the bounds of all other
   perfection and already gone beyond them all. I have seen an end of all
   perfection, but how vast a perfection beyond all that do I perceive in
   thy divine word, wherein there are yet but some sunbeams, some
   glimmerings of the perfection of the Divine Nature! Indeed when we go
   about to speak of such a subject as this, or to think of it, we may
   even fear to meet with such a rebuke as that, Job xxxviii. 2. "Who is
   this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?" Can we think, by
   searching to find out God? Can we find out the Almighty unto
   perfection? Job xi. 7 Somewhat, the case requires should be said, of
   what we can say and conceive but little of. Something, the exigency of
   our case doth require; that we labour, all of us, to be informed
   concerning one with whom we have so much to do, and in whose hands all
   our great concerns do lie.

   For the word that is used here, "perfect," and the words in the learned
   languages that we are referred to by these penmen, they do (as all
   words must do) fall most inconceivably short of the thing. Words cannot
   but be poor, and labour under a penury when they are expressive of any
   thing of God. Alas! They can go but a little way in it.

   The words that we have here to do with more immediately, do carry in
   them a kind of diminishing and lessening intimation of coming to a
   state, or having come to a state that is higher and more excellent,
   from a state that was meaner and lower; in which the subject spoken of
   is (as it were) supposed to have been before, according to the general
   and indefinite use of such words. As the Greek word teleios that is
   here used, refers to a word that signifies an end, and so carries an
   intimation with it, as one had but then attained an end which he was
   aiming at, and tending towards before, which implies such a diminution
   as can by no means be admitted concerning God. As when any one doth
   then suppose himself to have arrived at an eternal sort of perfection,
   when he hath compassed an end that he was about. "I work this day, and
   to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfect;" finish a work I was
   engaged in, which is but an external sort of perfection. The word (for
   want of being more expressive) is borrowed and employed here, in a case
   of very transcendent height above that. And so for the Latin word
   perfectio, or perfectus, it carries an intimation with it as if the
   thing spoken of were, now at length, thoroughly made that which before
   it was not. Such expressions do (through the natural poverty of speech
   and language) lessen and diminish greatly the thing that should be
   represented and set forth by them.

   But to consider the thing itself, (as we may be capable to open to you
   somewhat of the divine perfections) there are two things to be done in
   reference hereto. We shall note to you, some things more generally that
   do concern the divine perfections indefinitely considered: and then
   shall (though briefly) come to consider some of the particular
   perfections themselves, which we are more specially concerned to take
   notice of, that are comprehended under those generals.

   1. There are some things more generally to be laid down concerning the
   divine perfections, or excellencies, or attributes; you may call them
   which of these you will, fitly enough. And,

   (1.) There is this to be considered concerning them, that there are of
   these divine excellencies or perfections, which we are taught to
   attribute to God, some that are altogether incommunicable ones. There
   are some that are incommunicable; that is, that have not so much as a
   name common to him, and to us, by which they are to be signified and
   spoken of. As there is his Self-subsistence, his All-sufficiency, his
   Eternity and his Immensity. These are attributes, or perfections of the
   Divine Nature that are not so much as common in name to him and to us;
   so appropriate to him, that there is nothing known by the same name
   that can be said of us. And there are some of his attributes and
   perfections that are communicable, that is, which under one and the
   same name, maybe spoken of him and of us, of him and of the creature.
   As his wisdom; there is also such a thing among men: and his power;
   they have some power: and his goodness; they have some goodness: and so
   his justice, his holiness, and his truth: these are divine perfections
   that are spoken of under one and the same name, concerning him and
   concerning some of his creatures. That is one thing that you have in
   general to note; as concerning the incommunicable attributes of God,
   they have not so much as the same name with him and with us: for there
   is nothing in us, to which such names do agree: All-sufficiency,
   immensity, eternity, omnipotency, self-existence and the like. But the
   other (as was said) are signified by words applicable to some what in
   us, as to be wise, to be good, to be just, to be powerful and the like.
   And,

   (2.) In the next place, you must note, that for those divine attributes
   and perfections which are communicable, it is only the name that is
   common to that thing in him, and that thing in us, which is expressed
   thereby. It is true that there is the same name but not the same
   nature. There is a likeness, a similitude, but not an identity, or a
   sameness. Take heed of apprehending, or imagining any such thing
   between the divine wisdom, or the divine power, or the divine goodness,
   that are uncreated, and that which is created; and so of his holiness,
   his justice and the like. We are not to think there is a sameness of
   nature, though there be the same names used in such perfections as
   these, as they are found to be in God, and as they are found to be in
   us, or in the creature: for it is impossible that the nature which is
   infinite, and the natures which are finite can be the same. An infinite
   nature and a finite nature must needs differ infinitely, and therefore
   can by no means be the same nature. Wherefore, all that is said in this
   case, in reference to us, when God is pleased to derive and communicate
   from himself unto those whom he regenerates, that which is called the
   Divine Nature; it is only said of it,--that it is his image, and his
   likeness, that is conveyed or communicated: it is only some what like
   God or the image of God that is impressed upon, and wrought into the
   soul. We must take heed of thinking that it is the same nature, as they
   have thought and blasphemously spoken, who have talked of being godded
   in God; as if the very nature of God was under such a name as this,
   transmitted into the creature. And again,

   (3.) We must understand these perfections, or excellencies of the
   Divine Nature to be his very nature itself, and not to be any
   accidental thing superadded thereunto. We must not conceive that such
   divine perfections as wisdom and power and goodness and the like, are
   additions to the nature of God: but they are his very nature itself.
   There can be no such thing as an accidental supervention to the Divine
   Nature; but every thing that is in God must be conceived to be God. He
   is essential wisdom and goodness and truth, and is not these things by
   accident, as men may be, so as to have those things separable from
   their nature; no, nor can his nature, indeed, be so much as conceived
   without them. We are not to look upon them as accidents, either as
   separable or inseparable from his nature, but as being essentially
   included in it. And this is most evident, upon the account we have
   showed you; and the thing speaks itself in demonstrating to you the
   existence of the Godhead, that that Being whose existence we were to
   demonstrate, is self existent, existing always by and from itself
   without depending, without being beholden to any thing from whence it
   was. Now what is so self-existent is existent necessarily; that is, it
   owes its own existence to that peculiar excellency of its own nature,
   to which it is repugnant, and impossible not to exist. Now, whatsoever
   doth exist necessarily, so that its non-existence should be altogether
   impossible (which is the peculiar manner of the Divine existence) that
   must needs be unalterable. What is necessary, must be eternally or
   invariably necessary, and without any mutation: and nothing can be
   superadded to another but must infer a mutation: any addition would
   make an alteration. Therefore, none of these perfections are additions
   to God; for then they would make a change; but that which is
   necessarily what it is, never admits of any change, neither by addition
   nor subtraction any Ways.

   (4.) You must take this general note farther, that it is hence
   consequential, that the excellencies and perfections of the Divine
   Nature are in him, in perfect simplicity. That is, if none of them do
   differ from the Divine Nature, then it is impossible they should differ
   from one another; they cannot really differ one from another in
   themselves. It is true, indeed, that by our imperfect way of conceiving
   things, through the narrowness and incomprehensiveness of our minds,
   which cannot take in all things at once, we are fain to admit distinct
   notions which are wont to be called inadequate notions, concerning the
   Deity. We can conceive of such and such excellencies but by parts, but
   by little and little. It is but a small portion we can take tip of him
   in the whole, and but very little after all. And therefore, all we are
   fain (looking upon the glorious and ever blessed Deity) to conceive, is
   an unknown wisdom in him, and an unknown goodness, and an unknown
   holiness and the like. Not as if these things did more really differ in
   him than one and the same face, (as one aptly expresseth it) doth
   really differ in itself because a great many glasses are placed against
   it, that do themselves differ from one another, and are variously
   figured and cut, do seem to represent divers faces. There is, I say, no
   more of real difference in these perfections from one another, as they
   are in God, than there would be in that case of so many real things
   that are reflected by so many glasses, where the difference of the
   reflected image doth proceed from the glasses, and not from the
   original which is one and the same to them all. And that we may
   preserve the notion entire of the Divine Simplicity, it is easy to be
   demonstrated to them that shall consider--that if there be not a most
   perfect simplicity in the Divine Nature, so as that the several
   excellencies belonging thereto be really in him, one and the same
   thing, then these excellencies could not meet there but by composition;
   they would make a composition in the Divine Nature if they were there
   with real difference. But such a composition in the Divine Nature is
   altogether impossible, upon these two accounts. First, If there were
   such a composition there must be supposed a causation: if the Divine
   Nature were compounded, it would be inferred it were caused; and so God
   were not the first Cause of the first being: and, Secondly, (though one
   would think that nothing should need to be added after that, it being
   plain, nothing can be prior to God,) If there were a composition there
   would also be a limitation, and so these perfections of the Divine
   Being would not be infinite, and consequently they must be perfections
   altogether disagreeable, no way agreeing to the Divine Nature. It
   cannot but be that he must be infinitely wise, infinitely good,
   infinitely powerful, and the like. But he should not be so, if these
   things did really differ in him from one another; for whatsoever doth
   really differ from one another, doth limit that other from which it
   differs. If there be an infiniteness in goodness, or an infiniteness in
   power, or an infiniteness in knowledge, we cannot suppose many
   infinites; there cannot be more infinites than one; and therefore it is
   but one and the same thing that is all these. Whatsoever you do design
   to the one, you must detract from the other. And if you should suppose
   two infinites, you do thereby suppose neither to be infinite, but both
   to be finite. That therefore, you must fixedly retain, as a general
   rule, that the several excellencies and perfections of the Divine
   Nature, are in him, in most perfect simplicity, and so do not differ in
   him, as, one thing differs from another, Only the Divine Nature and
   Being itself, as it hath all excellency and perfection in it doth, when
   it comes to cast an aspect upon us and upon our minds, appear as
   various, though in itself it is most simply one. And again,

   (5.) You must further note this, that the negative attributes of the
   Divine Being do always imply somewhat positive. There are some things
   ascribed to God in negative terms, which must be understood to have a
   positive sense and meaning, under those terms. As when it is said of
   God, he is immortal, which is a negative term, it implies the most
   infinite and undecaying fulness of life. And so when it is said of God,
   that he is invisible, though that be a negative term, such a being as
   cannot be seen, the meaning is, that his being is of that high and
   glorious excellency as not to be liable and subject to so mean a thing
   as the sight of our eye; it is too fine, too bright and glorious for so
   mean and low a faculty to reach unto, And,

   (6.) You must note this, that any particular excellency that men
   attribute or ascribe to God, it must always be understood to be
   ascribed to him in the highest pitch of perfection, and not with that
   diminution wherewith we behold the shadow of such things to be
   accompanied in the creature. And therefore, we must take heed of
   debasing the excellencies of the Divine Nature, by confining,
   concerning them, to that which only gives some faint representation of
   them among us. We speak of several things that are real excellencies
   among the creatures; as quickness of sense, to be able presently to
   feel whatsoever is noxious and hurtful: this sense of pain, is in the
   creature a perfection; but we are not to conceive any such thing in
   God: but we are to conceive that which is transcendent in him, that
   comprehends in itself the power of giving such and such perfections to
   the creature; so as that those things are eminently, constantly, only
   in him which, speaking of this and that particular perfection, is in a
   distinct, formal notion in the creature. We must not say, that this or
   that we behold in the creature is in him, but some transcendent
   excellency that doth virtually and eminently comprehend it; as when the
   Psalmist tells us, "He that planted the eye, doth he not see? and he
   that formed the ear doth not he hear? and he that teacheth man
   knowledge doth not he know?" we are not to think that there is such
   seeing, or such hearing with God, or any kind of sensation as is with
   us: but there is that transcendent excellency in him, that doth
   eminently contain all these in a far more glorious manner than we can
   conceive. These things, it is fit we should note generally, concerning
   the divine attributes, or perfections, as a ground for somewhat more
   distinctly, though very briefly, concerning these attributes, or
   perfections of God, particularly considered.

   But before we pass from this discourse, of what is of more general
   import concerning them, give me leave to suggest somewhat to you that
   may be of present use, and that may influence practice, and tend to
   better the hearts and spirits of us, who are now called to hear about
   such a subject; "Your Father which is in heaven is perfect." So our
   Lord, who was a Teacher come forth from God, on one of his great
   errands, doth direct us to conceive concerning him. I pray let our
   thoughts stay here a little, and meditate, and pause awhile; both on
   this Subject here spoken of, and that which is affirmed concerning this
   Subject.

   [1.] The Subject spoken of, "Your Father which is in heaven." This
   NAME, "Your Father," should carry a very attractive sound with it to
   every ear, and to every heart among us. It is very unfit that we
   should, any of us, sleep and slumber under the mention of this name,
   this title given to God, "your Father." Let us bethink ourselves: Can
   we call God Father? It is a thing to be thought on--with much caution,
   and then, if that hath produced any effect, and reached any good issue
   with us, it ought to be thought on--with high consolation.

   First. With great caution. "Your Father which is in heaven is perfect:"
   when we find that some are addressed by our blessed Lord, with the
   supposed capacity of bespeaking God as their Father, would it not
   strike cold to any man's heart, that should have cause to think, "Am
   not I excluded? Am not I one of them that may not dare to take such a
   name into my mouth and apply it to him, to call him my Father? Doth not
   my own heart smite me, that I assume so much to myself as to say, God
   is my Father?" There were those that briskly and boldly pretended to it
   in our Lord's time. "We are not born of fornication, we have all one
   Father, even God." say some of these petulent hearers. John viii. 44.
   It ought to be seriously considered, "What Godlike thing have I in me
   to be speak me his child, or that may give me the confidence to call
   him my Father? What childlike dispositions do I find in me towards him?
   Is there that trust that becomes a child, that love, that dutifulness,
   that study to please him?" Let us consider whether we can call him
   Father, and our hearts not smite us, and tell us inwardly, this is a
   title that belongs not to thee to give. But if we can find it doth, it
   is a thing to be considered as with great caution.

   Secondly. With high consolation afterwards. Can I indeed say, that he
   is my Father? What then can I have to complain of? what have I to fear?
   what have I to desire? what have I to crave beyond what this contains,
   and carries in it? And pray take heed of diminishing so great a thing
   to yourselves. Have you, upon a strict inquiry, reason to look upon
   yourselves as one of that regenerate seed which is peculiar and
   appropriate to God? carries his signature, his stamp, his image? It is
   then a very unworthy thing to your Father, to let your spirits sink. It
   should greaten your minds, it should make you to say within yourselves,
   "Then am I to live far above the world, it is base, for the children of
   such a Father to live mean, and lie low, and to grovel in the dust; and
   to let his own heart despond and sink within him, upon the less
   grateful aspect and appearances of things from this world. For alas!
   what is this world to me, if God be my Father?" And, "Your Father,
   which is in heaven is perfect." You must consider how this our Father
   is in heaven; not as confined there, not as if heaven did confine him,
   whom the "heaven of heavens cannot contain." And we should thereupon
   consider, that truly if heaven do not confine him, this earth ought not
   to confine me. If he be my Father, there should be no exclusive limits
   between him and me. If he be my Father, so in heaven as that though he
   hath his throne, the theatre of his glory, his court, and his retinue
   there above, yet he doth also diffuse a vital and essential presence
   throughout the creation, so as that this earth itself is not excluded,
   "Whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven
   thou art there; If I traverse the seas, wherever I come, there thou
   art." Psalm cxxxix. 7. I say, if heaven doth not contain him, but that
   he reacheth this earth too, I should thereupon think this earth should
   not so confine me, but I will reach him, and apply myself to him, and
   converse and lead my life with him. And since heaven is represented as
   the seat of his most glorious residence, we should always think
   ourselves to have concerns lying there above. I am not to be limited
   then to this base low earth, if I have a Father in heaven. It is
   intolerable hereupon, that we should live here upon earth, if we had
   renounced and quitted all claim to heaven, never looking up thither.
   What! Do we forget that our Father is there? There he dwells in glory,
   there he beholds the dwellers upon earth, and looks into the very
   inmost motions of our thoughts, and workings of our spirits, from day
   to day, and from moment to moment; if he see a mind carried after
   vanity all the day long, will he not say, "What! Is such a one, one of
   the off spring of heaven, but hath no business there, who never minds
   any thing but this base earth?" Shall he have cause to observe this
   concerning us, and thus to judge and censure us from day to day? "These
   are the children of the earth, sons of the earth, they have nothing to
   do in heaven, they never look up thither." Such words standing here in
   the Bible, "Your Father which is in heaven is perfect;" methinks they
   should make strange impressions upon our spirits when we come to look
   on them and seriously consider them.

   [2.] And then what is affirmed concerning this Subject, (though I must
   not spend time upon that now,) he is perfect, every way perfect. We may
   yet, by the way, see what ground of reproof there is here for us, that
   we so little adore, and so little imitate this perfection. That God is
   not greater in our eyes when we are beholding him, and considering,
   that whatsoever our minds can conceive of excellency, we find it in him
   in the highest perfection, and yet we adore him not, we take no notice
   of that glorious One, how sad is the case when even this itself is a
   continual increase of guilt upon us, that we know so much of God, that
   a poor creature should have cause to say, "I should have been far more
   innocent if I had known less, and been less capable of knowing God. I
   might have been an innocent creature, in comparison, if I had not known
   so much." To know him to be so perfectly holy and not to imitate him,
   to know him to be so good and not to trust him, to love him, to depend
   upon him and to seek union with him; to know him to be so perfect, and
   content myself with my own imperfection, when according to this rule of
   our Lord we should be "perfect as our Father which is in heaven is
   perfect."

LECTURE XVIII. [7]

   2. But I come now to give, in the second place, some more distinct
   account of some, at least, of the more eminent of the attributes of
   God. And I shall begin with that which must be understood as
   comprehensive of all the rest, and that is, of the DIVINE
   ALL-SUFFICIENCY. This is the summary perfection of God; his
   All-sufficiency. And as the verse where the text lies, saith "Be ye
   perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect," so elsewhere, is the
   Divine All-sufficiency represented to us as the ground and pattern of
   that perfection which is required in us. Gen. xvii. 1. "I am God
   All-sufficient: walk before me and be thou perfect." The word there
   used is, in some translations, rendered All-mighty, in others,
   All-sufficient, El-Shaddai. They indeed seem to me, to give the more
   congruous account of the etymology of that word that do read it
   All-sufficient, deriving it not from Shadda that signifies to destroy,
   to lay waste, which yet, is comprehended no doubt (that is the power of
   doing so) in the notion of Almightiness, but rather deriving it from a
   word that signifies sufficiency with the pronominal particle he: He
   that is sufficient, God that is sufficient, El-Shaddai or that is
   self-sufficient. And he is so self-sufficient either understanding it
   to be a sufficiency arising from himself or a sufficiency serving for
   himself. Either way he is self-sufficient; by a sufficiency that speaks
   him to be All to himself, a sufficiency arising and springing up within
   himself, or a sufficiency to himself, as having enough in himself to
   enjoy without being beholden, without depending upon Any thing without
   himself. And such All-sufficiency spoken of God must needs mean, He
   that is of himself, sufficient for himself, must needs be sufficient
   for all the creation besides, If of himself there be a sufficiency in
   him for all his own perfections, there must he a sufficiency for all
   that communication that the creature can any way stand in need of. This
   is that attribute, that comprehensive one, that we shall in the first
   place say somewhat to.

   And I shall say the more of this, because it is so vastly comprehensive
   as hath been said, and as the matter is plain in itself that it is. It
   is the same thing that is meant by that fulness that we find again and
   again, in Scripture, attributed to God, that pleroma tou Theou, "That
   you maybe filled with all the fulness of God." Ephes. iii. 19. Not that
   there needs any great fulness to fill us. A very little thing will do
   it; and it signifies nothing to the vastness of the plenitude of the
   ocean, that a nut shell or a minute vessel may be filled; but it is the
   greatness of the expression that I here note, "the fulness of God;" how
   vast, how immense, how profound an abyss must that be! In Ephes. i. 23.
   we read of the "fulness of him that filleth all in all;" that filling
   fulness: it is another fulness that is meant there in that form of
   expression where, most condescendingly, the church of Christ in this
   world is spoken of as his fulness. But whose fulness is it? The
   "fulness of him that filleth all in all." Even he, notwithstanding his
   vast and boundless self-fulness doth yet vouchsafe to be filled in
   respect of that union that he is pleased to take a people out of this
   world into, with his own blessed Self. We read (Col. ii. 9.) of "all
   the fulness of the Godhead" dwelling in flesh, as it were, embodied in
   flesh, which we must understand still is the same fulness when it is
   deposited, when it is, as it were, so disposed for communication. It is
   not another fulness from the original Divine Fulness, but the same
   under a new relation wherewith it now comes to be clothed. As when
   also, in that Col. i. 19. it is said, "It pleased the Father that in
   him should all fulness dwell." fulness and all fulness, that it should
   dwell in him. It did dwell indeed in him originally and naturally in
   the person of the Son, but now it dwells in the Mediator, that being so
   lodged and settled, (as it were) it now lies ready for communication to
   indigent creatures, necessitous creatures, empty creatures; such as we
   are, empty of every thing that is good, and of the desert of every
   thing that is so; and only designed and fitted by natural designation
   as so many "vessels of wrath" to be filled with wrath. Now all the
   fulness of God comes to be posited and clothed with that relation, to
   put on that aspect, with reference to us, that according to our need,
   measure and capacity it is all for us. "It pleased the Father, that in
   him should all fulness dwell," with such a design that he might fill
   the sacrifice first, that was offered up, as you find the context
   speaks,--(Col. i. 19, 21.) "that he might make peace by the blood of
   his cross and reconcile all things to himself:" and then, that he might
   fill the souls which that sacrifice had been accepted for, in the
   virtue of it, opening its own way to flow in to us. And another
   expression you have of this same perfection, (the All-sufficiency and
   plenitude of the Godhead) to wit, that of his being "All in all." A
   most Godlike phrase, wherein God doth in his own word speak so of
   himself, speaks like himself, at the rate of a God, with divine
   greatness and majestic sense. It is used with reference to the divine
   operations, 1 Cor. xii. 5. "There are diversities of operations, but it
   is the same God which worketh all in all." But it is also spoken of the
   Divine Being with reference to his existence; He is All in all; or as
   in the mentioned place, (Ephes. i. 23) "filleth all in all." In the
   final state when all the great designs of God are compassed and brought
   about, then is he more entirely, fully and immediately to be All in
   all. He will be more conspicuously so then: he is now so indeed, as it
   hath not escaped the notice of heathens themselves, who tell us, that
   whatsoever we see is Jupiter, and whatsoever we are moved by, is
   Jupiter: that one universal mind doth work through all the universe and
   mingles itself with the vast body of the creation. So is Christ, in
   whom is all the fulness of God, (as was told before) he is said to be
   "All in all." Here is an All in an all, a comprehending all and
   comprehended all; that is, an uncreated All, and a created: the latter,
   contained in the former, the former, containing the latter, in-wrapping
   it, infolding it, diffusing itself any where, throughout it, and in
   all, and over all, and through all. And indeed, that created all, is a
   little, most contemptible little all, in comparison of the
   all-comprehending, uncreated fulness, that involves the other in as
   great a disproportion as you may suppose an atom, a little mote or
   particle of dust comprehended in the whole earth, or a minute drop in
   the vast ocean, that swallows it up and runs through it and through it;
   so is the all of this creation (as great as it may appear to our little
   narrow minds and thoughts) swallowed up in the uncreated All, so as
   that in comparison of that, it is nothing. All nations come under this
   notion, but "as the drop of a bucket, and the small dust of the
   balance, and lighter than nothing," as confessing it impossible to
   speak diminishingly enough of the littleness of the creature, in
   comparison of the Divine All, "less than nothing." Indeed, simple
   nothing cannot vie with all fulness, with the immense plenitude of
   substantial beings. But that, that seems to be newly stept forth out of
   nothing, that, it may be, will pretend to vie, and therefore that is so
   much the more despicable, even more despicable than mere nothing: mere
   nothing hath no competition with it to that vast plenitude and fulness
   of Being. But there may seem somewhat of competition in that which is
   just stept forth out of nothing: and therefore, that is despised as
   less than nothing; for mere nothing is not so despicable as that which
   is just risen out of nothing when it is brought into any kind of
   compare with the infinite, immense All.

   But to speak yet a little more particularly and distinctly concerning
   this most perfect All-sufficiency and fulness of God, (as it can be
   possible to us to speak and hear of so great a thing) I shall speak
   somewhat to the nature of it, what sort of fulness or plenitude this
   All-sufficient, perfect fulness is. And then--speak somewhat of the
   purposes which it answers and is most apt to answer.

   1. Somewhat of the nature of it. And for that, our best way of opening
   and unfolding it will be to consider these two things, namely, what it
   contains,--and after what peculiar it doth contain what it must be
   understood to carry in it: that is, the contents and the properties of
   this fulness: what it contains and with what peculiar and
   distinguishing characters it doth contain it.

   (1.) For the contents of this most absolute and perfect fulness of God,
   All-sufficient fulness; it contains all that we can think, and indeed
   all that we cannot think. It contains all being, and all life, all
   motive and active power, all knowledge and all wisdom, and all
   goodness; every thing that is excel lent, valuable and desirable in all
   the kinds, and in all the degrees of perfection conceivable, in
   reference thereunto. I shall not speak more distinctly now, in
   reference to that head, be cause under other heads that we are
   afterwards to speak a little (though but a little) particularly to,
   there will be more occasion to discourse of these severally. But we
   come,

   (2.) To consider of the characters of this fulness, the proper ties of
   it, whereunto it must be understood to contain what it doth contain.
   And so,

   [1.] It is a self-original fulness, a fulness that ariseth from itself.
   It is the highest fountain itself, and not fed from any higher, which
   is the signification of that title, or that name by which God was
   pleased to make himself known to Moses, "I Am," and a little more
   largely "I Am that I Am." A name so expressive of this plenitude and
   fulness of being and all-perfection of God; so aptly and naturally
   expressive thereof, that it hath obtained naturally, easily in the
   pagan world, as that inscription testifies in the temple, which I
   formerly named, "I am that which I was, and that which is, and that
   which shall he, and let any man at his peril disclose my veil." And we
   are told by some of the ancients in the Christian church, that the
   notions which Plato doth so abound with, he learnt in Egypt, and came
   by them, it is most probable, and as they think, as having been
   communicated from some of the Israelites to some of the Egyptian
   priests with whom he afterwards conversed, that is, with those of them
   to whom those traditions came some centuries of years afterwards. And
   that this fulness is self-original, or self-originate, they must always
   apprehend, who do apprehend that any such thing as Deity could only be
   of itself, from itself. A Being of that sort and kind, as unto which
   not to be, was always repugnant; and so that it owes whatsoever it is,
   or whatsoever it hath in itself, to that peculiar excellency of its own
   nature, which was always necessary to it, to be what it is; can receive
   nothing aliunde, from without, and can lose nothing, or suffer no
   detraction of what it is, or hath already belonging to it. This is "I
   Am," the stable and permanent Being that is by itself what it is. That
   then, is the character under which we are to conceive of this divine
   fulness, of this perfect All-sufficiency; that it is self-originate: he
   being the perpetual, everlasting Spring and Fountain of it to himself.
   "With thee is the fountain of life." Psal. xxxvi. 9. There, being is in
   its first Fountain, and life is in its first Fountain. To that, all
   things else that be and live, and that have any thing of motive and
   active power, they participate all from hence; "In him we live and move
   and have our being," as the apostle expresseth it, Acts xvii. 28. For
   which he there quotes a pagan poet; and likewise for that in the
   adjoining words, "we are all his offspring."

   [2.] We are to conceive concerning this Divine Fulness, that it is
   immense as well as self-originate. He is infinite, unbounded: and that
   it must needs be for the same reason, because it is self-originate: for
   causation speaks limitation, whatsoever causeth another, limits it: and
   that which is uncaused must be unlimited, omnis limitatis est causata;
   that which doth impart and communicate to another doth measure and
   bound its own communication: and from whence any thing hath that which
   it doth derive from another, thence it hath the bounds and limits of
   that which is derived. The limits of the derivation proceed from the
   original. Therefore it is plain whatever is uncaused must be unlimited,
   and so this fulness of God being self-originate without any superior
   cause, must needs be immense and infinite without bounds and limits.
   There is nothing to bound and limit, but he existing necessarily, when
   all things else do exist contingently, and by dependance upon his will
   and pleasure, it could not be but that he must engross all being, all
   life, and all perfection in himself, because there was nothing else
   existing besides or before that which did exist necessarily, that is
   himself, by which what was In him could not be any way limited.
   Therefore, so we are to conceive of the Divine Fulness--that it is
   immense. It is then a perfection here spoken of God, which is not
   particular of this or that special kind, but which is most properly
   absolute and universal, to wit, of all kinds taken together, with all
   the several degrees that can come within the compass of each several
   kind. So metaphysicians are wont to distinguish of perfection, into
   that which is simple or absolute, and that which sui generis, of its
   own particular kind, that which hath all that belongs to that kind in
   it, may be said to be perfect in its own kind. That which hath the
   essence and properties of gold may be said to be perfect gold, and
   especially if it be pure from dross and doth exclude every thing that
   is alien from it, if it be pure. That is the notion of pure: purum est
   quod est plenum sui, that is pure that is full of itself, and hath no
   admixture of any thing alien from it. So may a thing be said to be
   perfect in its own particular kind, when it is full of itself and when
   it is free from admixture of any thing else. But the Divine Nature (as
   is evident) is infinite and immense; is not perfect of this or that
   particular kind, but of all kinds whatsoever; that is, of all that is
   excellent and valuable; yea, every thing of all being, being included
   and comprehended in it. Not formally, for that would make God and the
   creature all one, but eminently and transcendently, that is, it being
   in the divine power to determine whether any thing besides should be
   extant, or not extant. And so he is the Root of being to every thing
   that is, and the Spring of life to every thing that lives, and the
   Fountain of all excellency to every thing that can partake of it. And
   therefore, his perfections or fulness is not of this or that particular
   kind; if it were so, it were a limited fulness, a bounded fulness: but
   it is a fulness that comprehends all kinds together eminently, and
   transcendently in itself. As the root of the tree doth comprehend all
   the branches, that is, virtually, it comprehends that virtue in it, and
   transmits that which extends to all the branches, and as the very seed
   did virtually contain the whole tree once in itself; so all the
   creation was contained in God, before it, by his appointment and
   command, stood forth into actual being. And,

   [3.] It is hereupon an immutable Fulness. This divine fulness admits of
   no alteration, either by augmentation or diminution. It can neither be
   made more nor less than it is: either, would make a change, and no
   change can have place in. that Being which is necessary. The Divine
   Being and all that plenitude and fulness that belongs to it, being
   self-original, it must be necessary; it could spring from no other,
   therefore, it must be of itself what it is: and no other imaginable
   reason can be assigned why such a Being doth exist, but only that
   peculiar excellency of its own nature, to which it was repugnant not to
   exist. Hereupon therefore, this is the only necessary Being, and that
   which is necessarily what it is, can never be other than what it is,
   can never vary, and therefore that "Father of lights (as the blessed
   God is mentioned under that name, James i. 17.) is without variableness
   or shadow of turning." Without so much as the umbrage of a change,
   there is not the shadow of variation with him. But before the creation
   was he was the same, and through all the successions of time when that
   creation is in being, he is still the same: and if the creation should
   drop back again into nothing he were the same. Unto that which is
   necessarily what it was first, nothing can supervene, because it hath
   its whole being necessarily, so that there can be no addition to it:
   and then there can be no detraction from it, no diminution, because it
   hath what it hath necessarily: it is essential to be what it is. And
   therefore,

   [4.] This plenitude of God, must be everlasting, this All-sufficiency,
   this perfection, must be eternal. For if there can be no variation in
   any, the least degree, much less is it conceivable there should be a
   cessation of the whole Being. A variation in any, the least degree, is
   altogether impossible to that which is necessarily what it is: and
   thereupon the eternal permanency of it in the same state must needs be
   consequent. Hence those amazing expressions about the Divine Being,
   "from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." Psalm xc. 2. Set
   yourselves to contemplate God; you must needs yield yourselves to be
   lost and swallowed up in your minds upon the contemplations of that
   which is "from everlasting to everlasting." And so that most emphatical
   expression, of his inhabiting eternity; "Thus saith the high and lofty
   One that inhabiteth eternity, I dwell in the high and holy place."
   Isaiah lvii. 15. But before that, he was his own place, and indeed all
   the creation is rather vested in him, than he in any thing. Before time
   was, or any creature was, he had nothing to inhabit but his own
   eternity, that is, his own eternal Self: for eternity and the eternal
   One are the same thing.

   Thus you have some account of the nature of the all-sufficient, perfect
   fulness of God, both from the contents and proper ties or perfections
   thereof; what it contains, to wit, all being, all life, all motive
   power, all wisdom, all knowledge, and whatsoever excellency besides you
   can conceive, or all that is conceivable, and indeed, all that is
   unconceivable by any created mind. And then, under what characters, as
   it is a self-originate fulness, an immense fulness, an unalterable
   fulness, incapable of any augmentation or diminution, and as it is an
   everlasting fulness.

   2. The next thing is to shew you what purposes this perfect,
   All-sufficient fulness of God may answer. And indeed, it answers all
   that is any way desirable should be answered, or that it were to be
   wished should be answered. For,

   (1.) It answers the corresponding purpose of its own felicity, to be an
   everlasting felicity to himself, where there is the only
   correspondency, that it is any way possible it should otherwise be;
   should any way be found between the fruitive faculty and the object.
   Here is an immense and boundless object for an immense fruitive
   faculty: nothing could satisfy God but God: there is a capacity not
   otherwise to be filled up. It was to be answered by nothing but
   himself, and therefore we must not suppose that there are any additions
   any way to that felicity from any thing without himself. He only enjoys
   himself and takes pleasure in his own designs. When he hath designs
   upon such poor creatures as we, he only pleaseth himself in himself, in
   his bountifulness, the benignity and the kindness of his own design.
   When he did, (he must be supposed to have done) even in the days and
   ages of eternity always retain with himself a design, "I will raise up
   such and such creatures;" such in particular as any of us; "I will in
   their proper time and season raise them up out of nothing, on purpose
   to take them into a communion and participation with me in my own
   felicity, my own blessedness." What is it he was pleased with? was it
   that he loved us or delighted in us? He was self-pleased with the
   kindness and benignity of his own design: not that any thing in us
   could draw his eye, his love, or his delight, but his kindness and
   goodness therein was its own reason. He sheweth mercy because he will
   shew mercy. It was not that one was better than another, but from that
   goodness of his that is invariable, and can never be better than
   himself, the complacency that it was always apt to take in its own
   designments. From hence it is, that he hath any such thing as
   delectation in a creature, only as he hath freely placed a design and
   made it terminate upon such a one, and so is pleased in that kindness
   and goodness which he hath in himself, and not in any delectableness
   that was previously in the object, For as to that, there was no more in
   one than another, and if it were for that reason as such, then it must
   have followed that all would have a like participation in the felicity
   of the Divine Being. But this is the eminent, great purpose that the
   divine All-sufficient fulness serves for, even for his own eternal and
   invariable felicity. Whence he hath so frequently the title and name of
   "the ever-blessed God;" his own blessedness being his very essence, or
   essential to himself; so that he was never to be known under another
   name, or conceived of under another notion, than as the blessed One,
   the Fountain of all blessedness; "The glorious gospel of the blessed
   God," saith the apostle, 1 Tim. i. 11. And "the blessed and only
   Potentate." 1 Tim. vi. 15. And "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who is blessed for evermore." 2 Cor. xi. 31. And so of Christ
   as he is God, he is said to be "over all, God blessed for ever." Rom.
   ix. 5. "Blessed for ever," that is, only in himself as the only
   correspondent and adequate object of his own fruition. And,

   (2.) His most perfect Divine Fulness, appears to have been sufficient
   for the creation of this world: and (which is but doing the same thing
   continually) preserving it ever since it was created, even until now;
   not only bringing it into being, a rude mass of being; but settling and
   conserving of order in it, and that variety and distinction of
   creatures, which we be hold and which indeed we must suppose to be the
   only effect of the All-sufficient perfection of a God. The very being
   of such a world speaks his power; but the order that is in it and the
   variety of creatures wherewith it is replenished, and the continued
   preservation of those distinct kinds and species through so many
   successive ages; so that what this or that plant is, or at least was,
   so many thousand years ago, it continues to be the same, a thing of the
   same kind; in the same rank or class of being still as it was. All this
   is by the All-sufficient, perfect fulness of a Deity that could answer
   such a purpose as this, to make such a mass of created beings exist and
   arise out of nothing; and that so much of order and distinction of
   kinds should obtain and be preserved even in this natural world,
   through so many successive ages unto this day. It was this that the
   perfect All-sufficiency of God did, and doth continually serve for.
   And,

   (3.) For the government of the intelligent world; so that wheresoever
   he hath intelligent creatures he can, by bare touches upon the mind,
   steer them and act them this way and that at his own pleasure: make
   great numbers of people at once to agree in one and the same design,
   all of them; as God did touch their minds in making Saul, king. And
   that is one instance that shews what is done throughout all the world,
   and all other ages, where all minds lie under the agency and influence
   of one supreme, universal Mind. And otherwise, how were it possible
   that all should conspire and agree to serve the same purpose and do the
   same thing. And again,

   (4.) This perfect, All-sufficient Fulness serves for the defeating of
   the designs of his enemies; so that he can with the greatest facility
   and ease, consume adversaries with a fire not blown, and make them
   "perish like their own dung:" and blow upon them with the breath of his
   nostrils and make every thing of opposition vanish when he will. And
   thereupon, as being perfectly Master of his own designs and having
   every thing in his own power with the times and seasons and ways of
   doing them, he lets enemies run on, foreseeing still at a distance
   their day that is corning. He knows their day is coming, and in the
   mean time sits in heaven and laughs at them, "the Most High hath them
   in derision:" them who say "Come, let us break their bands asunder and
   let us cast away their cords from us:" as it is in the 2nd Psalm.

   (5.) It answers the purpose of sustaining and preserving his own, the
   people that he hath collected and chosen out of this world to be
   peculiar to himself, the whole community of them and every particular
   soul belonging to that community so as to lose, none of them. He bears
   them up and carries them through all the temptations and conflicts and
   trials and exercises that they meet with here, in a sojourning state
   and in a warfaring state, so as that they are kept by his mighty power
   through faith unto salvation, And then,

   (6.) And lastly, this perfect and All-sufficient Fulness serves for
   their final satisfaction and blessedness, when they shall be brought
   into that region, into his "presence, where there is fulness of joy,
   and to his right hand where there are pleasures for evermore." Psalm
   xvi. 11. And that which is felicity enough for himself, will surely be
   enough for them too.

LECTURE XIX. [8]

   But now in the next place I shall speak further to you of some of the
   most eminent and noted of those attributes and perfections of God which
   are comprehended in this general one, and concerning the order of
   speaking to them, I shall not be much solicitous. Some distinguish them
   into negative and positive. But that distinction I reckon less
   material; because that those they call negative ones are so only
   verbally, there being somewhat most really positive, that is
   comprehended under such negative terms, as infinite and immortal and
   immense and the like. They are usually distinguished into communicable
   and incommunicable, as hath been occasionally told you already; the
   former whereof, being those attributes of God of which there is some
   image and resemblance under the same name among the creatures.

   The Incommunicable Attributes are those whereof there is no direct
   resemblance among the creatures, nor the very name thereof justly or
   properly to be given 10 any among them or to any thing that is to be
   found among them. And for this distinction of the divine attributes,
   they speak very properly and congruous to the nature of the thing, who
   tell us, that in the description of God, the former sort of these
   attributes (the communicable ones) do serve to express his nature more
   generally, or serve to supply the room of a generus in a definition.
   And that the incommunicable attributes serve to supply the place of a
   difference in a definition restraining (as it is the business of a
   difference to do) that general nature, that is presupposed.

   And others again distinguish these several ways, that is, some do call
   every thing a divine attribute, which may be any way affirmed
   concerning God. When some others of them do only mean by a divine
   attribute, that which is affirmed concerning him, (as the logicians are
   wont to speak) "Loquiter quid" not "in quo;" as when it is said, "God
   is a Spirit." that they do not reckon a divine attribute which is only
   to answer the question, What he is? But those things only are to be
   called attributes, or divine perfections, that do speak more
   distinguishably concerning his nature, to shew what a one he is, or
   what a peculiar sort or kind of being he is. And so for one class of
   divine attributes some reckon his natural proper ties which do some way
   specify his nature.

   And then for the second kind, the faculties which, (according to our
   way of conceiving things) we must attribute to him. And then for a
   third sort, the exercises that do reside in those several faculties,
   and for a fourth, those that do imitate the affections that are in us
   belonging to the rational nature, as it is to be found with us, such as
   love, anger, desire, delight or the like.

   I do not think fit indeed that we should tie ourselves to any such
   distribution. What I mentioned before, of communicable attributes and
   incommunicable, carries its own evident reason with it, and its own
   light to every one that observes things. There are some divine
   excellencies whereof there is an image and resemblance in the creatures
   fitly mentioned, under the same name in him and in them, though they do
   not signify the same thing in them as they do in him, but only the
   image or resemblance of such a thing. And then there are those that are
   incommunicable, and which neither in name nor in likeness can agree to
   the creature. This is a very plain distinction, obvious to any one that
   considers.

   For his incommunicable attributes they are such as these, and I shall
   but only mention them. As,

   1. His Simplicity, absolute uncompoundedness, all excellencies and
   perfections meeting, and being united in him, in the absolute unity of
   his own Nature without division, without composition and without
   mixture.

   2. His Immutability, by which he is always invariably, eternally what
   he is. "I Am what I Am." without "shadow of turning," (as the apostle
   James's emphatical expression is) there being not so much as the shew
   of a change.

   3. His Self-existence, or (which is all one) his necessary existence,
   or the necessity of his existence. That perfection of the Divine
   Nature, by which he is so, as that it is simply impossible for him not
   to be, or ever not to have been, his essence involving existence in it,
   so as it is not with any thing besides; for as to any created being, it
   may be, or it may not be; it may exist or not exist. But it is peculiar
   to the Divine Being to exist necessarily, so as that it cannot but
   exist: that is the same thing with self-existence, not existing from
   another, but existing only from himself. And,

   4. His Infiniteness, which comprehends divers things in it; for the
   infinity of the Divine Being, it is either extrinsical or intrinsical:
   extrinsical as it imparts some kind of relation to somewhat ad extra,
   or without, and so the extrinsical infiniteness of God is two fold:
   that which respects time and that which respects space. That which
   respects time is eternity, and that infinitely exceeds all the measures
   of time. Consider God's duration in reference to time, and his duration
   is eternal, which is founded in his self-existence, or his necessary
   existence, was told you before. His being, is of that peculiar kind or
   hath that peculiar excellency belonging to it that could never not be;
   and therefore must exist from eternity, and must be to eternity. This
   is his extrinsical infiniteness in reference to time. And there is his
   infiniteness in reference to space, which is extrinsical too. It is
   somewhat supposed without, or besides himself; though but supposed or
   but imagined. All that space which the Divine Being doth occupy and
   possess: and this is his immensity. In reference to time, his
   infiniteness speaks eternity, in reference to space his infiniteness
   speaks immensity, that which some understand to be his omnipresence.
   And indeed, it is mostly so, but not wholly, for omnipresence even as
   presence is a relative term, and refers to somewhat with which it may
   be said to be present, and so the divine presence can refer to nothing
   besides himself, without the compass of the created universe, for there
   is nothing without that, that he can be present to. But his immensity
   hath an infinitely further reference, that is, to all the boundless,
   imaginable space (only imaginable) through which the Divine Being
   diffuseth itself. For not only is it truly said concerning him. He
   fills heaven and earth, "Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the
   Lord." Jer. xxiii. 24. But also, "the heaven, and the heaven of heavens
   cannot contain him." as it is said in that seraphical prayer of Solomon
   at the dedication of the temple "Will God indeed dwell with men on the
   earth, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain?" And so his
   infiniteness in reference to space, it doth, without any limits, go
   beyond and transcend this vast created universe, be that as vast as it
   can be supposed to be: and it must be supposed to be very vast indeed,
   by all that do set themselves to consider what is by human indication
   or inquiry to be found most considerable, and who allow themselves the
   liberty ever to think of that vast extent of created being, in
   comparison whereof not only our earth is but a point, but even that
   vortex that covers this part of the world to which the earth belongs,
   is but a mere point, that which contains our sun, and the other
   planets; all that is but a mere point in comparison of the rest of the
   universe. Consider that, and the vast extent thereof, and you must yet
   consider, all this is but a mere point in comparison of the vast
   amplitude of the Divine Being, concerning which we are to conceive
   there is not any point of conceivable space any where, but there the
   Divine Being is, and still infinitely beyond it. And indeed, it is fit
   we should give great scope to our thoughts, that we may as far as
   possible conceive in this respect worthily and greatly concerning that
   God whom we serve and whose name we bear, and to whom we profess to be
   devoted ones.

   But then there is his intrinsical infiniteness besides, that is, his
   infiniteness considered not with reference to any thing without him,
   but in reference to what he is in himself. And so it signifies the
   unfathomable profundity and depth of his essence, including all being
   itself, in all the kinds, in all the degrees, and in all the
   perfections thereof; so as that there is no being of any kind, or of
   any sort, which his being doth not some way or other comprehend,
   virtually at least: his, being the radical Being from which all other
   beings spring.

   Concerning these Incommunicable Attributes, or perfections of the
   Divine Being, I shall say no more to you than only to give you this
   summary and short account that I have given, because in our
   demonstrating the existence a God it was impossible not to speak to
   these things: that was a thing not to be done without mentioning such
   things as these, even somewhat too in a way of demonstration, that
   demonstrating of them we might give some account of the Being whose
   existence we are to demonstrate. But now there are sundry other divine
   attributes that I shall speak a little more distinctly to, and which
   lie under that other head of

   Communicable Attributes, and which therefore are more familiar, and
   ought to be so to ourselves, as having some image, some resemblance of
   them, under the same names, in us; all, either have, or ought to have;
   some indeed have and cannot but have a resemblance in every intelligent
   creature, yea (and further than so) in every animate creature. And for
   those that fall under a moral consideration, they are such as ought to
   be in us, though they be not. These perfections of God are
   distinguished into natural, intellectual, and moral; or of his nature,
   mind, and will.

   First. I shall consider his natural perfections: and,

   1. I shall begin with that perfection of the Divine Nature whereof
   there is in us some kind (and ought to be in other kinds) a resemblance
   or image under the same name. And that is, the Divine Life, the life of
   God. I do not mean it now in that sense wherein it is a thing either
   derived to us, or prescribed to us. As in the one or the other, or both
   of these senses, that expression must be used and understood, (Eph. iv.
   18.) "being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that
   is in them s and because of the blindness of their hearts," speaking of
   the Gentile world, and those Ephesians themselves, while as yet they
   were in a state of gentilisrn. I do not, I say, speak of that life now
   which God requires us to live, and which he makes his own children to
   live. But I speak of that life which he lives himself; and in respect
   whereof he is so frequently in Scripture called "the Living God," that
   excellency of his Being, which he many times attests, to add weight and
   solemnity and emphasis unto his protestations to men, to assure them
   that this is so, or not so, or. that this f that he doth, or doth not,
   or will do, or will not do. "As I live, saith the Lord, I have no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked." And so, upon sundry like
   occasions, that form of protestation is used by him: "As I live I will
   do so or so, or it is so and so;" which intimates this, to be a most
   glorious excellency of the Divine Being, and that which he lays a
   mighty stress upon himself, and would have us to do so too. It is that
   which should highly raise our thoughts and apprehensions of the Divine
   Being, to consider him as the living God: and therefore the properties
   of that life by which he lives, (after the general conception of life
   itself,) would be worth our while a little to stay upon. We can have no
   other general conception of life, but that it is a self-active
   principle. It speaks a sort of self-activeness in the subject wherein
   it is: and so, being spoken of God, it attributes that to him in the
   highest perfection that can be thought, and indeed doth suppose it to
   be in him, in a perfection infinitely beyond what we can conceive: that
   is, that he is by the excellency of his own Being, a perpetual fountain
   of life to himself, It is that which is included in the notion of a
   spirit, though it is not expressive of all that is signified by that
   notion. It is but an inadequate conception of what is carried in the
   notion of a spirit. A spirit, it is, as such, (though that be not all)
   a self-active being, a being of self-actuating vigour, that can move
   itself within itself. And that is the most full and distinct conception
   that we have of life. But taking that for the general conception, there
   are peculiar excellencies of the Divine Life, that distinguish it from
   life any where else. As,

   (1.) His is absolutely self-originate. No other life is so; but his is
   absolutely self-originate. All other life is derived, participated,
   even such creatures to which life is essential, yet their life is but
   participated; for admit, life is essential, (as it is to all created
   spirits as such) yet inasmuch as their being is participated and
   derived, so is their life too; and their being, being a spiritual
   being, (though a created being) life is so essential to it, for if it
   ceaseth to live it ceaseth to be, and so its life and being are not
   separable things. It is not so with that life which our bodies do
   partake of; even in ourselves, our bodies and our souls have two very
   distinct sorts of life, our bodies have but a borrowed life, a united
   life which they borrow from the soul that is within them, and unto
   which they are united. That soul may retire and part, and then the body
   dies, and yet it is the same body that it was before: so that if it
   cease to live, it doth not thereby cease to be. These bodies of ours
   may cease to live, though not cease to be, because their life is a
   borrowed life from another: they have it from the soul. But the soul,
   that hath life in itself, essential to it; so that it can not cease to
   live, but it must cease to be. But though it be so, yet its essence and
   life are but derived from that great Original Life, and from that great
   Original Being whose life we now speak of. He is the well-spring of
   life, (Psalm xxxvi. 9.) "With thee is the fountain of life." It is
   equally impossible, as was said before, for him either to cease to
   live, or cease to be; where as to us this impossibility is only
   supposed, it is only a suppositive impossibility. If we should cease to
   live, we should cease to be too, in reference to these souls of ours.
   But it is positive as to God, that he can neither cease to live nor
   cease to be. His is therefore an absolute self-original Life. He hath
   life in himself, or by himself, as that expression is, John v. 26. "As
   the Father, (who we are told is our Father) which is in heaven is
   perfect." perfect in this respect, hath life in himself, a perpetual
   spring of life within himself, so hath the Son life in himself, as he
   is God, and as he is God-man; life to communicate and derive from
   himself to quicken whom he will, as it is in that context. And then,

   (2.) This life of God, as it is a self-original, so it is a
   self-communicative life; it is a self-communicating life. Not in the
   same kind, but it doth contain in itself eminently that life which it
   makes others to live, which it imparts unto creatures. Indeed they
   cannot live that same life, for life being essential unto him in whom
   it originally is, to communicate his life were to communicate his
   essence, and so we make the creature, God which is impossible. But he
   contains eminently in himself that life by which, formally, he makes
   the creature live. And so in that respect, the Divine Life, is
   self-communicative, causual, efficient, making those to live to whom he
   doth impart it. With him is the well-spring of life. Now these two
   things are carried in the notion of a fountain: 1st. That there be a
   perpetual spring in it, and 2nd. that there be a communication and
   eflux, a deriving of streams from that spring. These two things are
   carried in the very notion of a fountain. And so as he is the
   well-spring of life it imports,

   [1.] That life that is in him to be self-original, he is the perpetual
   Spring of it, in himself and to himself. And then,

   [2.] Self-communicative, continually deriving streams issuing and
   flowing out to the creatures, so as to quicken whom he will, as it is
   said, "the Son doth, in that," John v. 20. And

   [3.] This life of God is an indeficient life; a life that cannot decay,
   a life that cannot fail, a life that cannot languish, life always in
   the highest perfection, every thing in God being God, and therefore no
   more capable of diminution or decay, than the being of God is, which,
   as you have heard, is a necessary being, and therefore can never be
   otherwise than as he is, never more perfect, nor ever less perfect.
   And,

   [4.] It is universal life. The life which belongs to the Divine Being,
   is universal; that is, it carries all kind of life eminently in it, not
   formally but eminently. You know that there is a great variety of the
   kinds of life among the creatures; but all comes from one Fountain, and
   therefore that life which doth belong to the blessed God himself, it
   must be a universal sort of life, a universality of life, all kinds of
   life are summed up there, not formally but eminently, there being no
   kind of life that is lived by any creature, from the most excellent to
   the most mean and abject, but the power of giving it, the power of
   imparting it, being in himself who is the Original of life: he hath it
   within his own power to make that creature live this or that sort of
   life suitable to the capacity of its own nature, and it is observable
   to this purpose, that in that passage, Psalm xlii. 8. where the
   psalmist saith, "my prayer shall be to the God of my life;" in the
   Hebrew it is plural, to the God of my lives. And you know, a man (and
   more may be said in this kind concerning a holy man, a saint) lives
   several sorts of lives, as he lives a vegetative life, first the life
   of a plant, and then the sensitive life; the life of an animal, and
   then the rational life; the life of a man, and then, if he be a saint,
   as you know the Psalmist was, a holy life. Now all these lives are
   comprehended together in this one Fountain. "My prayer shall be to the
   God of my lives." It is he that makes me live all these several ways
   that I do live. As I live the life of a plant, I have it from him: as I
   live the life of an animal, I partake that life from him: as I live the
   life of a man, a rational creature, I still partake that life from him;
   and as I live the life of a saint, a holy man, I partake that life from
   him too, which carries the nearest resemblance with it of his own life.

   And thus we are to conceive of our Father which is in heaven, to be
   perfect in respect of this high and glorious excellency of life;
   self-original life, self-communicative life, indeficient life and
   universal life, that contains all sorts and kinds of life eminently in
   itself.

   And now to make some Use of this subject of the life of God, how highly
   should this raise our thoughts concerning that God whose name we bear,
   concerning our Father that is in heaven. It must highly serve to
   recommend him to us,

   1. As the Object of our worship. What a glorious object of worship have
   we! How may our souls solace themselves every time we go to worship in
   the contemplation of this, "I am going to worship the living God!" So
   he is pleased to distinguish himself from the false gods, by this same
   epithet of the living One. Therefore, we have living and true, put
   together distinctly concerning him. 1 Thes. i. 9. "To serve the living
   and true God." And it is with reference to the consideration of him as
   the glorious Object of our worship, that the apostle speaks of him, in
   Acts xiv. 15. when those ignorant barbarians, among whom he was, would
   have done worship unto him and Barnabas, he runs in among them and
   saith "Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions
   with yourselves, and preach to you that you should turn from these
   vanities to the living God, who made heaven and earth and all things
   therein. "Our business is to bespeak you to be worshippers of the
   living God alone." Thus doth the word magnify him above the inanimate,
   senseless deities of the pagan world, who were wont to worship stocks
   and stones and the works of their own hands; and bow down and pray to a
   god that could not save. And how should we magnify to ourselves the
   Object of our worship, under this notion, and admire and bless God that
   he hath revealed himself to us, so as we are not left altogether
   ignorant whom we are to worship, that we do not worship altogether we
   know not what. We know the Object of our worship carries in it the
   reason of its own being worshipped, which renders it a rational
   worship. He is the living and so the true God whom we worship.

   2. How highly should it recommend him to us as the Object of our trust.
   "Therefore we labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the
   living God who is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that
   believe. 1 Tim. iv. 10. and chap. vi. 17. "Charge them which be rich in
   this world that they trust not in uncertain riches but in the living
   God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy." How heart satisfying an
   Object of trust have we in this respect, considering God as the living
   God, the Fountain of an indeficient, never failing self-original and
   universal life, in all the excellencies and perfections of life.

   3. What an Object of fear have we even in this conception of God, or
   from this divine attribute. "It is a fearful thing to fall into the
   hands of the living God." Heb. x. 31. A man may be angry with me, and
   he dies and then his anger dies with him; but it is a fearful thing to
   fall into his hands who never dies, the hands of the everlasting God.
   Who would not value his favour as that wherein stands life? It should
   mightily raise our apprehensions concerning God to conceive of him so.
   And,

   4. It highly recommends him to us as the Object of our imitation. For
   this is one of the divine excellencies or perfections, whereof there is
   a mimesis, a resemblance under the same name in us. We do all of us
   live (as was said) several sorts of lives wherein we do resemble God.
   But we should most of all resemble him in a holy life, such of us who
   are raised from death to life, or shall be so. And herein it is the
   duty of every believer to resemble him. This is matter of precept, a
   thing capable of being put into a command. It is no matter of duty to
   us to imitate him in the other kinds of life, but In this kind of life
   it is matter of duty to imitate him in it, that is, in the perfection
   of that life which is therefore called the life of God, because it is
   prescribed us by God, enjoined us by God and it is that wherein we are
   to imitate God. And therefore, it is called, even as it is in us, "the
   life of God." Ephes. iv. 18. Others not yet reconciled to God, not
   brought home, but remain in their natural, unconverted state, they are
   "alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them
   because of the blindness of their hearts." We are to consider God, the
   living God, as the Object of our imitation: and therefore, should
   reflect with just severity upon ourselves; "Do we pretend a relation
   with the living God, and say he is our God? O! then what mean our dead
   prayers, our dead duties, our dead hearts! that we let them be dead,
   and do not strive and wrestle and contend with them, to get them up to
   this raised perfection of life wherein we are to resemble God, and to
   express a visible conformity to him!" It is a severe rebuke which is
   put upon the Sardian church. "Thou hast a name to live and art dead."
   It is plain, he doth not speak of a total death, or as if there was
   nothing of spiritual life among them, for in the next words he saith,
   "be watchful and strengthen the things that remain which are ready to
   die." There were great degrees of deadness, but strengthen (saith he)
   the remains of life, "the things that remain that are ready to die,"
   and see how it is enforced, "for I have not seen thy works perfect
   before God." Your heavenly Father is in this respect perfect, as he is
   the living God, as life is in him in the highest pitch of perfection
   and excellency: "but I have not found your works perfect before me, as
   your heavenly Father is perfect;" therefore, "strengthen the things
   that remain that are ready to die;" that your life may shine in lustre
   and glory more suitably and conformably unto the divine life, unto the
   life of God himself. But now,

LECTURE XX. [9]

   2. In the next place I shall go on to speak somewhat concerning the
   POWER OF GOD which is another natural perfection in him, and is next of
   kin to the life of God. Once have I heard this, twice hath it been
   spoken, that power belongeth unto God, as in that 62 Psalm 1, verse. It
   is in him as in its native seat and subject. It belongs unto him.
   Nothing is more appropriate, more peculiar to God than power: and it so
   belongs to him as it can to no other. If we speak of strength, lo, he
   is strong: (as the expression is in Job) implying all created power is
   not to be spoken of in comparison with him. All other power is not to
   be named power, not worthy to bear that name. "Your heavenly Father is
   perfect" in this, as well as other respects: power is with him in
   perfection; the perfection of power belongs to him.

   And here, concerning the power of God, I shall give you some instances
   and some properties of it.

   (1.) Some instances of it. As,

   [1.] That it hath been the sole, productive cause of this great
   creation. Consider all this vast creation as resolved back again into
   nothing: and then consider it all springing up out of nothing (as it
   were) at once. How vast a power is this! Whatsoever in all the whole
   universe of created things you see or hear of, or can think of; all
   this is raised up out of nothing by the divine power. To bring any
   thing out of nothing, how vast a power would it require! how far
   surpassing any human, any created power! If you could but suppose all
   the powers in all the world, if the whole creation were to be combined
   and united together only for this one single purpose, to make one
   single atom, the least that can be thought to be raised out of nothing,
   you would easily apprehend it would never be. If all the world were
   assembled to contrive and unite their power to make a grain of dust out
   of nothing, they must all confess it infinitely above them. Then to
   have so vast a creation as this made to arise out of nothing, at once
   from nothing come to being, how should it overwhelm us to think of it;
   all that we now behold in being, and so far beyond, so inconceivably
   beyond what we can behold it to be. This earth of ours, as spacious as
   it is, is but a mere point, compared with our own vortex; but a part,
   but a little corner of the creation, and that but a mere point in
   comparison with the rest of the universe; and all this spoken out of
   nothing into being by the great Creator: the word of Divine Power but
   saying, "Let it be," and it was. Lift up your eyes on high, as the
   prophet's direction is, Isaiah xlix. 18. and think who hath created all
   this: when you behold the sun, and moon, and stars, the vast expanse of
   the heavens, and all the ornature thereof. And again,

   [2.] There is the continual sustentation of this world, once created
   and made, which is the same momently expense of power; for all created
   being, if not continually sustained must, by its own natural
   mutability, every moment be dropping into nothing. So that here is the
   same power put forth as if a new world were created every moment. And
   then,

   [3.] That all the motion that is any where to be found, throughout the
   whole universe continually proceeds so from it, that the divine power
   is the continual spring of it. A wonderful thing to think of! We are
   apt to have our thoughts soon excited and awakened concerning the
   divine power when we see some wonderful instance of it fall out,
   besides the ordinary course. When we behold the effects of some violent
   wind and impetuous tempest; if we see trees torn up by the roots,
   houses shattered down, all to pieces, mountains torn asunder, the
   bowels of the earth ript open, we straightway think these to be great
   instances of a mighty power. But the power is in comparably greater
   that works continually and every moment in all the motion that is any
   where through the universe, in the most still, and silent, and steady
   and composed way. The power that continually, but silently turns about
   the mighty orbs of heaven, and the great luminaries that are in it,
   and, as some think, this very earth itself, in that still, unobserved
   way that we can take no notice of, which if it be, is incomparably less
   than that the so inconceivably greater body of the sun should be moved
   in so inconceivably greater a space, so much larger in circuit, so
   vastly large, with that celerity that must answer what we expect and
   see every day. What must that power be that goes forth in this? Such
   motion of the heavenly bodies that we find move the sun, and moon, and
   other planets, besides all the innumerable stars, multitudes whereof
   are so unspeakably greater than the body of the sun, and that so vastly
   greater than this earth of ours: and all these continually turned about
   by a motive power: which because it is steady and constant we are
   therefore so stupid as not to take notice of it, or adore what is doing
   by it every moment, without failure, without stop, even for one moment.
   We are to blame that we do not more use our thoughts this way, to
   aggrandize to ourselves the greatness of him that made all things, and
   us little inconsiderable parts of them all. And again,

   [4.] That this power doth work constantly and steadily with nature in a
   natural way, and extraordinarily, whensoever he will to whom it
   belongs, against nature. Here is what doth demonstrate It to be the
   exceeding greatness of his power, it is vastly great, as it co-operates
   with nature, as it works with nature. And how vastly great doth it
   appear as it counterworks nature in several respects, and at his
   pleasure whose power it is. It was great power that could make such a
   thing as fire to burn, to seize and prey upon other matter, and devour
   and consume it. But how much greater power doth it require to make fire
   not to burn, to bind up the natural tendency of it, as in the instance
   of the three children. It was a great power to make that great element
   of water to flow along every where as he hath assigned its receptacles
   and channels; and greater again when he pleaseth to make it not to
   flow, to congeal, as it were, and to stand up the mighty waves on a
   heap. And again,

   [5.] If we look a little into another sort of species, what a weighty
   instance of this power was it to support the manhood of Christ under
   those sufferings of his, which he, as to satisfaction for the sins of
   men, and in which capacity only he was capable of suffering; to wit, as
   he was man, for he could not suffer as he was God. That that man should
   be able to bear the weight and load of all that guilt, which he
   undertook to expiate by his blood, which blood was necessary to expiate
   it, and to lay a foundation for the preaching of the gospel, which
   saith, "who soever believeth in him shall not perish, but have
   everlasting life:" that he did not sink under that weight and load of
   guilt, and under the power of divine wrath, when all our iniquities did
   meet on him: that he, one single man should be sustained and borne up,
   when so vast a load and weight of guilt lay upon him: here was the
   power of the Godhead sustaining that one man. It was because he was
   Immanuel, "God with us," God in our nature. That that nature did not
   fail, did not sink under that mighty load: that that man should stand
   as the fellow of God, when the sword was drawn to strike that man his
   fellow: that he should stand against him and not be destroyed, and not
   be overcome, is a great power. And again hereupon,

   [6.] What an instance of the divine power was the resurrection of that
   man? Smitten he was, and smitten down unto death, into the grave. And
   yet out from thence he springs up anew, by a divine power, "and was
   declared to be the Son of God, with power by the Spirit of holiness, by
   which he was raised from the dead." It was an exceeding greatness of
   power, as you read, Ephes. i. 19. which he wrought in him, or exerted,
   or put forth in him, when he raised him from the dead. And again,

   [7] What an instance is it of the power of God, when he changes the
   heart of a sinner, when he reneweth and reduceth a lapsed, fallen,
   apostate, degenerate creature; that is, especially when he changeth his
   will, the primary, main seat of that mighty change. "Thy people shall
   be a willing people in the day of thy power." Here is the perfection of
   divine power to be seen in this: for most plain it is, as I said before
   about creation, that if all the power of all this world were combined
   together for this one effect, to alter the will of one single man, it
   could never be done; you know how to crush, how to tear him into a
   thousand pieces, but no man knows which way to change the will of a
   man, not in any instance whatsoever, unless God change it himself. In
   instances of common concernment, nobody hath power over another man's
   will; all the power of all this earth is not able to change my will if
   I have set it this way or that. But his people shall be a willing
   people in the day of his power: your heavenly Father is perfect,
   perfect in power in that he knows without doing violence to his
   creature, without offering any thing that shall be unsuitable or
   repugnant to its nature, to change its will. He knows how to govern his
   creatures according to their natures: though he knows how to rule and
   govern them, yea, to over-rule them contrary to their nature when he
   will, yet he chooses to govern his rational, intelligent creatures
   according to their nature, and so agreeably changes the hearts of men,
   according to that natural way wherein the human faculties are wont to
   work; a thing that all the powers of the whole world could never do
   besides. And again,

   [8.] What an instance is it of his power to uphold the life of a
   regenerate soul, during its course through this world! A great instance
   this is, that their heavenly Father is perfect in power. For most
   certain it is, as soon as any one production of this kind appears, if
   there be a child born, a son of God born from above, all the powers of
   hell and darkness are presently at work, if it might be, to destroy
   this new, this divine production. But it is enabled to overcome. "He
   that is born of God keepeth himself, that the evil one toucheth him
   not:" and "he that is born of God overcometh the world." This is by a
   divine power annexing itself to, and working in, and with, this new
   creature. The apostle speaking of one weak in the faith, (Rom. xiv. 1.)
   weary in the faith, as the original signifies, shews that such a one
   might be received, but not to doubtful disputations: for God (saith he)
   is able to make him stand. This poor weakling, one that is weak in the
   faith, receive him (saith he) for God (as despicable a thing as he
   appears) is able to make him stand. Every new-born child is weak, and
   we must conceive so concerning every regenerate soul: he is at first
   weak, and they are always too weak, (God knows) as long as they remain
   here in this world. They have distempers, weakening distempers always
   about them. But concerning such a weakling, that it should be said,
   "God is able to make him stand," makes it to be an instance of a
   divine, enabling power that ever he should be made to stand. And it is
   the like case where such are spoken of under the notion of bruised
   reeds, to make a bruised reed stand against all the shocks of hell,
   when all the infernal powers are engaged to overthrow it: God shews
   that he is able to make it stand. And thus it is with such a poor
   creature all the time of his abode upon earth, hell is engaged in a
   continual conflict against his precious life, and purposely and with a
   design to destroy that. But God is able to make it stand, it lives as a
   spark amidst the raging ocean, and is never extinct but always lives.
   What an instance of the divine power is this! And again,

   [9.] Restraining the wrath of man combined with the power of hell
   against his church in this world. He hath built this church upon a
   Rock, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. The design hath
   been always driven, and the attempt continually renewed from age to
   age. One age hath been industriously at it to root religion out of the
   world, to extinguish the divine seed, but they could make nothing of
   it: another age rises up after them, "Come (say they) let us handle the
   matter far more wisely and take better methods and carry it more
   secretly, that we may do our business more securely, and see what we
   can do to extinguish and root out religion:" and so the age after that,
   and then the next after that, and so from age to age until this age,
   and yet the thing is not done: yet this church remains, and is still in
   being, and is yet propagating itself. This is owing to the perfection
   of divine power. Their Father which is in heaven is perfect, perfect in
   this power of his, by which he conquers all the powers which are
   engaged against his poor church in this world, he triumphs over the
   feeble and impotent attempts of men and devils. "He that sits in the
   heavens laughs, the Most High has them in derision." The wrath of man
   shall praise him and the remainder thereof will he restrain. Psalm
   lxxvi. 10. The wrath of man he turns to his praise; he makes matter of
   praise and triumph to himself that the wrath of man goes forth;
   pleasing himself with this, "How shall these wretched creatures see
   themselves foiled and baffled within a little while!" He raiseth
   trophies and triumphs to the greatness of his power, from all the wrath
   of man that goes forth. And that which shall not belong to his praise,
   all that he will restrain. He can let it go forth as he pleaseth, and
   restrain the remainder thereof as he pleaseth. What he lets go forth,
   creates to himself a name upon its going forth, and he suppresseth the
   rest. And though I might thus multiply instances, I shall add but this
   one more: and that is,

   [10.] The power he shews in forbearing and sparing a sinful world, and
   (upon his own prescribed terms) here and there, as he pleaseth,
   pardoning and forgiving particular sinners. This is a power which in
   some respects surmounts all the rest, or an instance of power that
   surpasseth all other instances. In other instances, his power shews
   itself in mastering of a creature, or outdoing all created power, but
   herein he useth a certain sort of power over himself, restraining his
   own great wrath, omnipotent wrath, that it break not forth to consume a
   world, and turn it into flames, as it righteously might have done many
   ages ago. "Let the power of my Lord be great according as thou hast
   said. The Lord is gracious and merciful, and of great forbearance,
   forgiving iniquities, transgression and sin." Let the power of my Lord
   be great. O! how great is his power over this world! But how much
   greater is his power over himself, when he withholds his anger, and
   lets not his fury go forth to consume and make an end of sinners, as he
   easily could in a moment. But,

   (2.) I shall in the next place, after these instances, give you some
   properties of this divine power. It is,

   [1.] Original, as must be said of all divine attributes. All other
   power is derived, secondary, borrowed, participated from another; but
   the divine power, God is beholden to none for; it is self-sprung,
   self-original. "This have I heard," saith the Psalmist, "once and
   again, that power belongeth unto God." It is in him, as in its native
   subject. His is the first power, the very beginning of power. It is in
   him as in the root and fountain: and so he is of himself, the mighty
   One. "If we speak of strength, he is strong." Job ix. 19. As if it had
   been said, All other strength is not worth the speaking of. If we speak
   of strength, meaning a strength fit to be spoken of, or mentioned under
   that name, that is divine strength. The divine is self-originate, it is
   in him as in its first original. And again,

   [2.] It is irresistible, or invincible, not to be resisted if he
   pleaseth, and not to be overcome however. He will work and none shall
   let it. His work shall go on, of whatsoever kind it be; if he have
   designed it once, resolved it once, it shall be done through all,
   whatsoever opposition. Saith that man of God Moses, that great man,
   (Deut. xxxii. 3. designing there to give an account of God) "Because I
   will publish the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness unto our God:
   He is the rock, his work is perfect." It is spoken concerning him and
   his work as a stated, settled character, that whatsoever work he
   resolves upon, he will make thorough work of it; and so his work shall
   bear the heavenly image upon it. Your heavenly Father is perfect, and
   his work is perfect, carried on irresistibly, whatsoever it is, upon
   which he sets his great heart, against all opposition. And again,

   [3.] He is a self-moderating power; a power that can moderate itself.
   Indeed, the power of all intelligent beings is more or less so. It
   belongs only to brute agents to act, ad ultimum. Intelligent ones can
   govern their own power. But such is the divine power in perfection, a
   self-governing power that doth not go forth ad ultimum. He can temper
   it as he pleaseth, and there is a most observable indication of the
   peculiar excellency of his power in this respect continually, though
   men observe it not, though men take no notice of it, that it is
   self-moderating, as was said before, there could be no such thing as
   motion any where throughout this great creation of God; but through a
   motive power from him, even his own motive power, he being the first
   mover; no hand turns, no creature moves but by a participation of a
   power from him, the great Fountain of all power. But now supposing
   without the creation, apart from the creation, so vast a power (as the
   divine appears to be) to go forth without moderation, without
   restraint, if once there were such a consistent thing and this world,
   by any means formed and connected together, I say by any means formed
   and connected together, that divine power, not self-moderated power,
   must needs shatter this consistent world all in pieces in a moment. If
   that power were not self-moderated, so that things are guided and moved
   in a steady, orderly course, it must be so, How easily doth a great
   wind throw down, a house! Then so vast a power going forth from the
   Creator of this world, supposing it compacted, congested, brought to a
   consistent thing already, must needs shatter it all in pieces if that
   power were not self-moderated that goes forth upon it, And again,

   [4.] An infinite power; that is a further property of it. How often is
   the great God, our God, our heavenly Father celebrated as the Almighty.
   "I know that thou canst do all things," saith humbled, convinced Job,
   when God puzzled him with so often repeated, "Canst thou? Canst thou do
   this? and. canst thou do that thou seest done? and where wast thou when
   I did so and so? when I laid the foundations of the earth? where wast
   thou when the morning stars sang together? who ever thought of thee in
   that age?" When God had thus argued with him and brought him down to
   the dust. (chap. xlii.) he saith, "I know thou canst do all things and
   that no thought can be withheld from thee." That is, "Whatsoever thou
   thinkest to do, nothing can withhold thy thought from proceeding to
   execution, from coming into fact, if thou wilt do it. Thou hast an
   unbounded power without limits." But this must be duly understood. It
   is to be noted here,

   First. Concerning the infiniteness of the divine power, its
   omnipotency, its almightiness, that it can never exemplify itself by an
   infinite effect. As it doth not follow, because divine power is
   infinite therefore the world created by that power is, or could be
   infinite: or, that it was possible for God to make an infinite one; you
   would think that strange perhaps. Cannot an infinite power produce an
   infinite effect? Can it produce an effect contrary to itself? No, but
   yet the other is impossible: and the reason is so plain, that I think
   when you consider it, every one will understand it. That is, if you
   should suppose the infinite power of God to have made an infinite
   effect, this infinite effect can be made no better, no greater than it
   is; for nothing can be added to what is infinite; and if so, then that
   infinite power could do nothing more. So that it is a contradiction for
   an infinite cause to produce an infinite effect, for an infinite cause,
   would be exhausted by producing an infinite effect: but an infinite
   cause can never be exhausted, therefore an infinite effect can never be
   produced by it. That is, it can never be said concerning an infinite
   cause, that it can do no more. But if it should have produced an
   infinite effect it could do no more, for nothing can be added to what
   is infinite. And,

   Secondly. This is to be further noted, that this infinite power,
   omnipotence, almightiness, it cannot do impossible things, neither
   things naturally impossible, nor things morally impossible.

   i. Not things naturally impossible. It can give being to nothing that
   carries self-repugnance in it, that should imply a contradiction if
   such a thing should be. Whatsoever implies a contradiction is no object
   of omnipotency. As for instance, to make that not to be; that is, while
   it is, to make a thing to be and not to be at the same time; or to make
   a thing that hath been, not to have been. This implies a contradiction,
   this is naturally impossible and so, by consequence, is not an object
   of almightiness. And,

   ii. Any thing that carries in it a moral impossibility is no object of
   divine power. To do an unjust thing, to lie, is impossible with God,
   impossible to his nature; and therefore, when we speak of the
   infiniteness of divine power, the perfection, the absolute perfection
   of it, we are to consider this as it is conjoined with other divine
   perfections, and so we are not to mea sure our notion, or conception of
   the divine power, by what it, abstractly considered, can do, but as it
   is the power of a Being in all other respects absolutely perfect. It is
   one thing therefore to inquire and determine what almighty power,
   considered apart by itself, can do, and another thing to consider what
   almighty power in conjunction with all other divine perfections can do,
   as it is in conjunction with holiness, justice, mercy, and wisdom. And
   it can never work but as it is in conjunction with these, as it is
   joined with all these together. Though God be almighty, omnipotent, he
   cannot do any unjust thing, an inept thing, a foolish thing. This were
   impotency, not omnipotency. It would speak him impotent, not
   omnipotent: it were an imperfection of power, not a perfection of it.
   We must consider him as perfect in power, and it would be an
   imperfection of power to suppose him enabled to do any thing that were
   unfit to be done. And then,

   [5.] Jn the last place, his is eternal power. His eternal power and
   Godhead go together, "Trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord
   Jehovah is everlasting strength." A perpetual, never failing spring, he
   is in this, as he is in all the attributes and excellencies of his
   being; "I Am that I Am. What I Am, I am without variableness, or
   without shadow of turning." That continual expense of power that hath
   been ever since the creation, first arose out of nothing, hath not made
   that power suffer any diminution, nor can it suffer any. He is still
   the same, without variableness, without mutation, without so much as
   the shadow of a turn, of a decay, of any failure.

   Let us make some Use of this.

   1. Labour deeply to apprehend this perfection of the Divine Being: fix
   the apprehension of it: let all our hearts say with in us, "Lord we
   subscribe, we agree, we yield to the light and evidence of divine truth
   concerning thy divine power." It is a lamentable case that the clearest
   notion of divine truth should be with us, as if we held the quite
   contrary, so as that with reference to effects, and impressions upon
   our spirits, it were all one to us, to believe that God were
   omnipotent, and had all power, infinite power, and to believe he had no
   power. It is a reproach to us, that our notions of truth, when they are
   never so plain, are so insignificant, so void of effect, and of their
   proper correspondent impression upon us.

   2. Take heed of admitting disputations against the divine power. Let
   the foundation be once firmly laid with you, that power belongs to him
   in its highest perfection; and then admit no disputations against it.
   We are too prone to do so, to misimpute things, to impute things wrong
   that we take notice of, and that come under our observation, and make
   that a cause which is not a cause; we think that things do go in this
   world many times very irregularly, and so as we wish they might not, or
   they did not do, and secret atheism unobservedly slides in and
   insinuates itself. "If there be a perfect One, perfect in power as he
   is in all his other attributes, why are things thus? why do they go
   thus? why is not what is amiss redressed, and presently redressed?"
   But, as was said before, we are not to judge of what the divine power
   can do, but to consider it in conjunction with other attributes:
   consider it in conjunction with perfect wisdom, as we shall have
   occasion afterwards to speak, consider it in conjunction with perfect
   liberty and with absolute sovereignty. If we did consider things thus,"
   We are not to imagine that the divine power is to be exerted according
   to our will, but according to his will," dispute would cease, the
   matter would drop: we should presently say, "I yield the cause, he
   knows better how to use his own power than I can direct him." Who hath
   directed the Spirit of the Lord, and who, being his counsellor, hath
   instructed him?' And,

   3. That it may be so, let us labour to get our spirits into an adoring
   frame and disposition towards him under this notion, as our heavenly
   Father who is perfect in power, as the perfection of power is in him.
   Let him be always great and admirable in our eyes under that notion,
   and so considered. And further,

   4. Let us glory in him upon that account: let our hearts exult in the
   thoughts that our heavenly Father is perfect in this respect. Walk
   accordingly in his name, glory in it, make your boast of him all the
   day long. This hath been the temper and genius that hath governed among
   a people related to him heretofore. "Our God is in heaven and he hath
   done whatsoever pleased him." When all people are wont to walk each one
   in the name of his god, why should not we walk in the name of the Lord
   our God? Their gods that are no gods, they please themselves with and
   take a kind of pride in owning them. O how warrantable a matter of
   gloriation have we, to go with hearts lifted up in the name of our God!
   Our God is in the heavens, and doth whatsoever pleaseth him: and can
   with the greatest facility carry every cause that he is engaged in. He
   cannot fail, finally to own and right all that are brought to him, and
   adhere to him, whatsoever their present excuses for awhile may be.
   Learn hence again,

   5. To value an interest in him, and covet it, and labour to make it
   sure and clear. Who can but think it the most desirable thing in all
   the world, to have him who is so infinitely perfect in this, as in all
   other respects, for their God? How secure would it make a man's heart,
   how quiet and rationally quiet to think, that power, all power, is in
   the hands of my Father! My Father can do whatsoever he will, he hath
   all power in his hand. And then,

   6. When you have made it your business to secure an interest in him
   upon this account, and under this notion, then trust in him under the
   same notion. Exercise a daily, vital trust upon him. "Trust in the Lord
   for ever, for with the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength." Isaiah
   xxvi. 4. See how things correspond there, "Trust in the Lord:" "Why,"
   might the soul say, "I have need of a God, and a strong one to trust
   in." In the Lord Jehovah is strength; trust in him. "But I have need of
   strength for ever, being made to live for ever." In him is everlasting
   strength; so that you have as much reason to trust in him to day as you
   had yesterday, and will have to-morrow as you had to day: for in the
   Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength, strength that will never fail,
   and it is trust that must keep you from falling. "He gives power to the
   faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength;" and "they
   that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength." Isaiah xl. 29, 31.
   And,

   7. Lastly, Dread to have him for an enemy. O! consider the fearful case
   of such as are engaged in a contest with him! Consider their folly,
   their madness, their misery; and labour to keep at the remotest
   distance from their state: fly from that sort of men as a dreadful
   spectacle; you fly from among them by ceasing to be of them. That is,
   by seeking reconciliation with God, and an interest in him, and
   striking a covenant with him, then you are delivered from being of
   them; but think in the meanwhile with pity and compassion, what mad
   creatures they are, that are engaged in a contest against omnipotency,
   "Woe to him that strives with his Maker! Let the potsherds strive with
   the potsherds of the earth." But what! shall a potsherd of the earth
   strive with all the powers of heaven? How unequal a match, how mad a
   choice is this! And from thence take your measure of what is like to
   become of all the contestations in this world against God, and against
   his interest. We are not to prescribe to him concerning the times and
   seasons and methods: but do you see a sort, a generation of men set
   against God and godliness? It is easy to judge the event; you may
   easily foresee the effects in the power of their productive cause.

   And thus I have gone through those attributes which we call his natural
   perfections.

LECTURE XXI. [10]

   Secondly. I shall now come to speak of those perfections of God that
   are to be considered under the head of intellectual ones, and there we
   have these two to consider and speak of, as more eminent perfections,
   the KNOWLEDGE OF GOD, and his WISDOM. These are great perfections of
   the Divine Mind, wherein we must understand our heavenly Father to be
   perfect, as the text stiles him. I shall speak to these both together,
   they being congenerous, and of one sort and kind, though they are to be
   conceived of by us, with some distinction. And,

   1. For HIS KNOWLEDGE: our heavenly Father is perfect in this respect;
   or his knowledge is most perfect knowledge. It appears to be so, both
   in respect of the peculiar nature of it, and in respect of its extent,
   with reference to the objects about which it is conversant.

   (1.) In respect to the peculiarity of its nature: it is knowledge of
   such a kind as is appropriate to God only: that is, upon this account
   principally, that it is entirely intuitive not discursive. It is not
   such a sort of knowledge as that by which we proceed, as we do from the
   knowledge of plainer and more obvious things to the knowledge of those
   that are darker and more obscure. But his knowledge of all he knows is
   simultaneous, that is, he knows all things at once, all at one view. We
   come to know some things by the knowledge of others which we foreknew,
   and so are fain to lead on our minds from step to step, and from point
   to point. The case is not so with him. All things are at once naked and
   manifest to his view, so as that, though he doth see the connexion of
   things and knows them to be connected; yet he doth not know them or any
   of them because they are so connected; that is, because he knows such
   things, therefore knows such other things as are connected therewith,
   as it is with us, while we proceed by rotation from the knowledge of
   some things to the knowledge of more. His is in this respect most
   perfect knowledge. And,

   (2.) It is so in respect of its extent, in reference to the objects
   known. And we must,

   [1.] Suppose the extent of this knowledge so vast as to reach simply
   unto all things: that is, not only all things that do exist, but all
   things that are even possible to do so. In this respect, with reference
   to the objects of divine knowledge, it is aptly wont to be
   distinguished into that which they call Simplicis intelligentia et
   purae visionis. It is no matter for opening to you those terms; but the
   thing intended to be signified by the one and the other is briefly
   this--that God doth not only know all those things that shall certainly
   be, but all those things that are possible to be. And so in that
   respect the object of his knowledge is equal to his power. There is
   nothing possible but what he can do, but what he can effect. Every
   thing is possible to him because he can make it to be. And so vast as
   that ambitus, circle of his omnipotence, so vast also is the object of
   his knowledge or omniscience; that is, he knows whatsoever he can do,
   he knows the utmost extent of his own power though he never intends to
   do actually all he can. But then,

   [2.] The perfection of this knowledge, in reference to the object of
   it, is most especially conspicuous in two things, namely,--that he
   knows all futurities and--that he knows all the most secret thoughts
   and purposes of men, or generally of his intelligent creatures.

   First. That he knows all contingent futurities. It is needful you
   should understand me right here, not only bare futurities, that is,
   things that shall certainly come to pass. There are many men can
   certainly foretell many future things: that is, natural futurities and
   such as do depend upon certain and settled causes; as when it is
   morning, the night will come, when the sun is risen, that it will set,
   when the sea has ebbed, that it will flow, and the like; but contingent
   futurities mean quite another thing, that is, such futurities as do
   depend upon free causes, such as do depend upon the will and pleasure
   of such creatures as have a certain sort of liberty belonging to their
   nature. And thence comes that miracle of prophesying; that God should
   be able to tell so distinctly and with such certainty, for many ages
   yet to come, that such and such things, men will do. Nor are we to
   think so debasingly of this knowledge of God as to suppose it depends
   only upon this his purpose to make a man do whatsoever he knows he will
   do; which indeed were to debase it into the very dirt, and to make him
   accessary to all the impurities and wickedness in the creation, by men
   or devils. Arid it is to narrow it as much as to debase it: that is, to
   suppose that he could not know that men would do so and so unless he
   would make them do the very things that he forbids them, in the very
   circumstances wherein he forbids them. And this indeed were to subvert
   the whole entire notion of divine forbearance and permissive
   providence. As when we are told (Rom. iii. 25) "That God set forth his
   Son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, for the remission
   of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God." To suppose that
   sin should be past, through the forbearance of God, that is, that he
   forbearing men, they sin, were a subverting the notion of forbearance,
   if he made them do (by a positive effective influence) all that they do
   in a way of sin, though the thing be never so apparently evil in itself
   most intrinsically evil, as the very act of hating himself. To suppose
   that he should only so know this or that, that he should be ignorant
   who should hate him and who should not, among the children of men,
   unless he should make them hate him, and determine to make them do so
   that he might know what they would do; this were not only to debase,
   but infinitely to narrow this knowledge of God. To suppose that he
   cannot know but upon such and such terms, or in the same way wherein
   the devil hath some certain foreknowledge of what he intends to his
   uttermost to make men do, must infinitely debase and narrow his
   knowledge. He is not an idle or unconcerned supervisor of the affairs
   of this world, and doth not only foreknow whatsoever one will do, but
   he knows too how to limit their actions and how to restrain and how to
   convert and turn to good, what they do with the most evil and
   mischievous intentions and designs, but upon this it is that he doth
   demonstrate his God head, that he is able to declare future things long
   before they come to pass, and did so; that he hath given such
   predictions of what should be, long before it was. In many places of
   the prophet Isaiah he doth, as it were, magnify his own Deity in
   opposition to the paganish gods, by this, that he hath declared the end
   from the beginning, even what shall be in all aftertimes. As in the
   xli. xliv. and xlviii. chapters of that prophecy we have many passages
   of that import. And in that 41 chapter, verse 22, 23, he doth (as it
   were) provoke and challenge the heathen deities to demonstrate their
   Godhead this way, "Produce your cause," (saith he) "let them declare
   things to come, that we may know that they are gods:" as if he had
   said, "Let them never talk of being gods, or that there is any such
   thing as deity belonging to such despicable idols unless they can
   foretell things to come. And this is the true import of that great
   scripture: Rev. xix. 10. "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
   prophecy:" that is, that which should demonstrate the truth of the
   Christian religion or prove against all contradiction that Jesus was
   the Christ, was the spirit of prophecy so long before, that he should
   come at such a time and in such circumstances into the world as
   eventually he did. And,

   Secondly. This perfection of divine knowledge is most eminently
   conspicuous in this too, his knowledge of the hearts of men; that he
   knows the most secret thoughts and purposes of men's hearts, and looks
   into them with an eye that injects fiery beams. He hath an eye as a
   flame of fire, that searcheth hearts and tries reins; so as that when
   there is (as it were) a challenge given to all this world; "Who can
   know the heart of man? "It "is deceitful above all things and
   desperately wicked who can know it?" (Jer. xvii. 9.) here comes one,
   that answers the challenge, "I the Lord search the heart and try the
   reins." And this is one of the great things that both demonstrates and
   magnifies his Godhead. Amos iv. 13. "He that formed the mountains and
   created the wind, and that declares to man what is his thought, the
   Lord, the God of hosts is his name."

   I shall not further insist on this, but pass on to the other
   intellectual perfection, in respect whereof we also ought to conceive
   our heavenly Father is perfect; that is,

   2. His WISDOM. He is perfect in being perfectly wise, all-wise as well
   as all-knowing. I told you we were to speak of these perfections of the
   Divine Nature, and conceive of them, according to what analogy they
   have to such things as go under the same names with us, and so wisdom
   and knowledge are two distinct things. Many know much who are not wise:
   but so we are to conceive of the perfections of our heavenly Father,
   that he is not only most perfectly knowing, but most perfectly wise
   also. Wisdom, you know, is commonly distinguished into speculative and
   practical: sapience and prudence. Indeed, the former doth not greatly
   differ from knowledge but somewhat it doth. It is not needful for me to
   stay to explain to you the distinct notions of intelligence, sapience
   and science. The first whereof, is the knowledge of principles, the
   last of conclusions, and the middle comprehends both together.

   But besides what hath been said concerning the knowledge of God, it
   will be of more concernment to us to consider his wisdom, as it
   corresponds to that which with men is called prudence, as the
   expression is Prov. viii. 12. for both are most conjunct with him. "I
   wisdom dwell with prudence." And so this wisdom lies in always
   proposing to himself the best and most valuable end: and choosing the
   aptest and most suitable measures and means for computing it. According
   as any one doth more perfectly both these, he ought to be accounted
   more perfectly wise. Now his end is known to every one that knows any
   thing of God, he cannot but be his own end. As he is the Author so he
   must be the End of all things for himself. He hath made all things for
   himself, by the clearest and most in disputable right. There could
   never have been any thing but by him, and it is not to be supposed that
   he should make a creature to be his own end. It would not consist with
   the wisdom of a God, that he should do so: it were indeed to make a
   creature to be a God to itself, or that he should upon such terms make
   a creature to ungod himself. And whereas, the just display of his own
   glory is the means to his end, his doing that, is most conspicuous in
   such things as these, to wit, in the creation of the world, in his
   providential government of his creatures, in the mighty work of
   redemption, wherein he hath abounded in all wisdom and prudence; and in
   the conduct of his redeemed through all the difficulties of time to
   their eternal state.

   These are the means; or his actual displaying or diffusing of the beams
   of his glory in all these ways, is that by which he doth effect his own
   glory, make it to shine as that he is there upon the most worthy and
   becoming Object unto all eternity, of all the adoration and praise of
   his intelligent creatures; the most worthy and deserving Object,
   whatsoever is done, or not done by any of them. My limits will not
   allow me to insist, at least not largely, on these things.

   (1.) The creation of the world. What a display of wisdom was there in
   that! If we take but the two great and comprehensive parts of it,
   heaven and earth, "He hath established the earth by his wisdom, and
   stretched out the heavens by his understanding," or discretion. Jer. x.
   12. And if you should look into the one or the other of these more
   comprehensive parts, it would not be conviction only, but transport and
   admiration that we ought to be put into every hour, or as often as we
   make any such reflection. But I must not go into particulars, as I
   might. And then,

   (2.) For the providence by which he governs this created world, and all
   the variety of creatures in it, so as that all things in their own
   particular places and stations do most directly subserve the purposes
   for which they were visibly made, they are sustained that they may do
   so: they are guided and governed and ordered in all their natural
   tendencies and motions that they may do so. And,

   (3.) For that wonderful work of redemption, the apostle gives us this
   note about it, that he hath therein abounded in all wisdom and
   prudence. Ephes. i. 7, 8. Herein did the perfection of wisdom and
   prudence shine forth, to reconcile the mighty, amazing difficulties,
   and seeming contrarieties, real contrarieties indeed, if he had not
   some way intervened to order the course of things, such as the conflict
   between justice and mercy; that the one must be satisfied in such a way
   as the other might be gratified; which could never have had its
   pleasing, grateful exercise without being reconciled to the former. And
   that this should be brought about by such an expedient, that there
   should be no complaint on the one hand nor on the other, herein hath
   the wisdom of a crucified Redeemer, that is, whereof the crucified
   Redeemer or Saviour was the effected Object, triumphed over all the
   imaginations of men, and all the contrivances, even of devils and hell
   itself; for they undoubtedly were so secure upon no account as this,
   that they saw our Lord die. Satan filled the heart of Judas to bring it
   about that he might die; animated the whole design: this was the
   devil's contrivance, "If he that is turning the world upside down,
   doing such wonders every where, all men running after him be but dead,
   if we can bring him to his end, we shall certainly make an end of his
   religion, we shall certainly make an end of his design." But even by
   that death of his, by which the devil contrived the last defeat, the
   complete destruction of the whole design of his coming into the world,
   even by that very means it is brought about so as to fill hell with
   horror, and heaven and earth with wonder. And then,

   (4.) The conduct of the redeemed through this world, notwithstanding
   all the obstacles, discouragements, and difficulties that lie in their
   way, what a display, a glorious display of the divine wisdom is there
   in this! I shall not speak to particulars distinctly, but only give
   some general account. As,

   [1.] That it hath never yet made any wrong step; that amidst all these
   wonderful varieties of actings and dispensations wherein it hath been
   engaged ever since there was a creation, there should never be any one
   wrong step made, nothing amiss done, nothing ever done out of time, or
   otherwise than it should. And,

   [2.] That it is never at a stand, never puzzled, hath always its way
   open to it, every thing forelaid: "Known to God are all his works from
   the beginning," as that sage speech is of the apostle James, at the
   famous council of Jerusalem. Acts 15. He can never meet with a
   difficulty that can put him to a stand; for his way is always plain and
   open before him. And,

   [3.] That he never loses his design, never misseth any end that he
   proposes to himself: The counsel of the Lord always stands, and the
   thoughts of his heart take place through all generations. Psalm xxxiii.
   11. And,

   [4.] That he doth so frequently disappoint and bring to nothing the
   designs of the wisest and most contriving men, turns their wiles upon
   their own heads, "takes the wise in their own craftiness," drives their
   way headlong, precipitates their counsels into confusion and abortion:
   as the expressions are in that 5th Job 12, 13. and in the 33d psalm, 9,
   10. And many more we have in Scripture, of the like import. And then,

   [5.] That he frequently surpriseth the most apprehensive and sagacious
   among men; doth things that it was never thought he would do; wondrous
   things, terrible things that we looked not for. Isaiah lxiv. 3.
   Sometimes they are fearful surprises that he brings upon men, and
   sometimes grateful ones. Indeed, the same dispensation may be at the
   same time most terrible and most grateful, most terrible to one sort
   and most grateful to another, as they must be understood to be that are
   mentioned in Isaiah lxiv. 3. "Terrible things that we looked not for,
   the mountains flowed down at thy presence." That is, the most
   mountainous oppositions, the loftiest and most aspiring spirits brought
   down and made to stoop: and all their pride laid in the dust; so it
   hath often been beyond all expectation, he still shewing his ways to be
   as much above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts, as the
   heaven is high above the earth, and as the east is far removed from the
   west. So it hath been when he hath gone beyond any fear or foresight of
   his enemies, and above all the hopes and desires and prayers of his
   people, done beyond what they could ask or think. What wonderful
   conspicuous beamings forth of the divine wisdom, have there been in
   such ways as these!

   I shall not discourse to you further doctrinally, concerning these
   things. Something I would say by way of Use, before I pass from them.
   Thus our heavenly Father is perfect. Why these are very clear notices
   of God, which we soon hear; we have heard them now within the compass
   of a little time; and we as soon assent to them as we hear them. But
   pray let us look into ourselves and consider, What impressions have
   they hitherto made upon our hearts? Have our hearts been all this while
   leaping and springing within us, and saying, "This God is our God; our
   heavenly Father is thus perfect?" Hath that been the lively sense of
   our souls within us all this while t And consider, these notices of God
   are not new to us. Did we never hear before that the living and true
   God is all-knowing and all-wise? When were we without these
   apprehensions? Such a conception of God as this we have had ever since
   we had the use of our understanding, and heard or knew any thing of God
   at all. But pray consider, What suitable, permanent and abiding
   impression have we borne about the world with us hitherto? and what is
   he so far manifested and made known to us for? Is it not that our
   spirits might be formed by the discovery, and our minds thereby
   governed agreeably thereunto? How comes it to pass that such things as
   these should have had all this while no more influence to beget a
   correspondent heart and spirit in us towards God? Is it that these
   things are of little weight, that they sink no more into our hearts and
   souls? Or is it a matter of small concernment to us, what a one he is
   whom we take for our God, or profess to have so taken? Is that a matter
   of small concernment to us? Do we know what the name of God imports? To
   be a God to us, is to be our "All in all," to be such a one to us every
   way, in point of good to be enjoyed, in point of power and authority to
   be obeyed and submitted to. Can it be a little matter in our eyes, what
   a one our God is, he that we hare to do with continually as our God?
   And by how much the more easily we assent to such things concerning him
   when we hear them, it argues that they are so much the plainer, and
   therefore that the guilt must be unspeakably the greater and
   unspeakably the heavier, if our hearts and spirits be not in some
   measure proportionably framed and steered and conducted according to
   the import and tendency of so plain things. These are not dark things
   that need much explication to us, nor doubtful things that need proof
   or demonstration. We are satisfied already, that he could not be God,
   who is not infinitely knowing, and infinitely wise, and perfectly both.
   So that we have nothing at all to do but to comport in the frame and
   temper of our spirits, and in the course of our walking with these most
   evident things. And by how much the greater they are, and the more
   sacred they are, (and things that we profess to believe and apprehend
   concerning God must be such, for a greater one could not be concerned
   than he,) the greater profaneness must it be to abuse such notices as
   these are, or not to use them, not to improve them to their proper
   purpose and end. We know such things concerning God: and have we
   nothing to do with the things of God, but to trifle with them or to let
   them lie by as neglected, useless things, when they are to run through
   our lives and to have a continual influence upon us through our whole
   course from day to day? Are these things right in our minds and
   understandings, and our hearts in the mean time only as a rasa tabula,
   a mere blank? There are such notices in our minds, but look into our
   hearts and see what corresponds there. Alas! there is nothing, a mere
   vacuity: what a sad case is this! and yet the discovery of these things
   breathes no other design but only to form our hearts and spirits and
   that our lives may be proportionably governed. It is a dreadful thing
   to have the knowledge of God lie dead in our souls, as if that were to
   go for nothing. Here I might shew you what impressions this discovery
   of the divine perfections should make upon our hearts, and might thence
   proceed to shew you in many instances that it doth not make that
   impression which it should. But I must not take that course. I will
   briefly hint a little at the former, the latter you will recollect
   yourselves: rectum est index sui et obliqui: If it doth appear once
   what we should be and do, correspondently to the apprehension of the
   divine perfection in these respects, it will be easy to us to
   animadvert on ourselves and see wherein we are not what we should be,
   and do not what we should do correspondently hereunto. It is plain,

   1. That such a discovery of God, in these perfections of his, should
   conduce greatly to the forming and composing of our spirits to
   adoration, to make adoration of him to be very much the business of our
   lives. How grateful should it be to us to think we have such an Object
   for worship and adoration, the all-knowing and the all-wise God! How
   vastly different in this respect is our case from theirs that worship
   stocks and stones for deities, senseless and inanimate things! That
   worship woods and trees and rivers and fountains and beasts and
   creeping things and the like. What hath God done for us that he hath
   made himself known to us in these great perfections, as the Object of
   our worship! that when we pray we know we pray to an intelligent Being
   that knows all things, and an all-wise God that judgeth what is best
   and most suitable to be done in reference to what we supplicate him
   about, and when and how to do all that he judgeth fit to be done. There
   ought not only to be an adoring frame in solemn worship hereupon, but
   an adoring frame we should carry about with us through this world,
   often looking up to him, and considering that we have always an eye to
   meet our eye, and are to apply mind to mind, (what a satisfaction is
   that!) understanding to understanding, our imperfect understanding to
   his perfect one. With what adoring souls should we go through this
   world every day upon this account! But do we do so? Consider how far
   short we come in so plain a case as this is. And again,

   2. Should it not make us stand much in awe? The matter is plain: great
   knowledge and wisdom in a man, great prudence creates great reverence,
   especially if it be in conjunction with things that we know are in the
   highest conjunction here, if in conjunction with authority, power and
   dignity. But even apart they do much in this kind; when a man hath the
   repute of a wise man, of a knowing person, it would strike us with so
   much awe as not to trifle, not to play the fool in the presence of such
   a one. Is there any thing proportionable with us in our frame and
   deportment towards the all-knowing God? Our heavenly Father is
   perfectly knowing, perfectly wise; in what awe should we stand of him
   continually upon these accounts! And again,

   3. It should fill us with shame to think what he knows by us. He is all
   eye as one said truly of him. With what confusion should it fill us to
   think he should know so much by us every day? Every vain thought, every
   light motion of our mind, all our fooleries, all our triflings, all our
   impurities that lodge and lurk in our hearts are known to him. This
   thought made a great impression upon a heathen; (Seneca, as he
   testifieth himself,) omnia sic ago, tanguam in conspectie, I do every
   thing as in sight, as having an eye that doth rimari, pry into my
   breast. O! what a shame is it that we should need a heathen instructor
   in such a matter as this! and how confounded should we be before the
   Lord to think what he knows by us continually, that we should be
   ashamed that men should know such things concerning us, as we are not
   ashamed he should know. The ingenuity of grace is wanting, it works
   not, shews not itself. It hath wrought like itself heretofore, "I
   blush, I am ashamed to lift up mine eyes to heaven." saith good Ezra,
   and that, when he speaks not so much neither concerning his own sins as
   the sins of the people.

   4. How should it make us study to be sincere. Nothing in us so answers
   perfect wisdom and knowledge in God, as sincerity. Every thought of my
   heart thou hast known long before; and it follows in the same Psalm,
   139. "Search me O Lord and try me, and shew me if there be any evil
   way" (any painful way as the hebrew admits to be read) "in me, and lead
   me in the way everlasting." Again,

   5. It should possess us with great complacency, (those that can reflect
   upon their own sincerity,) that they are continually in view to God. It
   should be a complacential thought, to think that he who is so perfectly
   knowing, and so perfectly wise, knows their sincerity, and knows too,
   all their infirmities. That he knows their sincerity, "Thou knowest all
   things, thou knowest that I love thee." John xxi. 17. And that he knows
   their infirmities, and will consider them with indulgence and
   compassion. "He knows our frame and remembers that we are but dust."
   Psalm ciii. 14. And,

   6. It ought to possess us with trust, habitual trust that should run
   through our lives. Is not such a one fit to be trusted? doth it not
   highly recommend him to us as the Object of our trust, that we know him
   to be perfectly knowing and perfectly wise? You can easily apprehend,
   an ignorant fool is not to be trusted. One that is ignorant and a fool
   is no fit object of trust. Is not he therefore that is perfectly
   knowing and perfectly wise, a fit Object? How cheerfully therefore
   should you trust him with all your concernments, how cheerfully should
   you intrust him with the concerns of this world, and your part and
   share therein? considering in what hand your affairs and all affairs do
   lie, even in his who will make, "all things work together for good." So
   he hath engaged to do, and he is most knowing and most wise that hath
   so engaged. Imprudent persons promise rashly what is not in their
   power, but he that is perfectly knowing and wise can never do so.
   Though I might mention divers other things I will shut up all with
   this,

   7. It should make us study conformity to him in these respects. Have we
   this discovery of the perfections of our heavenly Father, that he is
   perfectly knowing and perfectly wise? It should make us endeavour after
   conformity to him in knowledge and wisdom: for these are some of his
   communicable excellencies: that is, his imitable ones. We should think
   with ourselves, "Is it for me to pretend to him as a child, to call him
   Father, to say, my Father which is in heaven is perfectly knowing and
   perfectly wise, when I am nothing else but an ignorant fool?" Wisdom
   expects to be justified of her children. Are we the children of wisdom,
   are we the children of him that is perfectly wise and perfectly
   knowing? Certainly it concerns us to be like our Father in these
   respects: this is a great part of his image, even of his image to be
   renewed in us. "Put on (saith the apostle) the new man which is renewed
   in knowledge after the image of him that created him." Col. iii. 10. Is
   it for the glory of the all-wise and all-knowing God to have a company
   of fools for his children, ignorant creatures that know nothing, and
   labour not to know much of the things that most concerns them to know,
   in reference to him, and what lies between him and them? We should,
   upon these accounts, labour to value and covet, most of all, mental
   excellencies' such as these. But such is not the common guise of this
   world. And it is an amazing thing, to think so many intelligent
   creatures' minds and spirits (though lodged in flesh) should be so lost
   as to all apprehension of true excellency, or of what is truly
   valuable, as to value a little glitter, a little exterior pomp and
   splendour before these mental excellencies of knowledge and wisdom,
   that are most peculiar to God, and wherein we, if we are possessed of
   them shall most resemble him. What fools are the men of this world!
   They esteem men according as they have most of worldly pelf, as they
   have collected together most of thick clay, but they never think of
   valuing themselves or any one else by the mental excellencies of
   knowledge and wisdom in which they resemble God. What base erroneous
   thoughts must these be supposed to have of God! What do such make of
   God? As the apostle speaks to these Athenians, but speaks as knowing
   and understanding them and himself to be of a mind as to this, he
   argues with them from a principle and ex concessis "What! do you think
   the Godhead is like silver and gold or corruptible things?" As if he
   had said, "I cannot but know as well as if I were within you that you
   are of my mind perfectly in this matter, that is, that the God head is
   not like to silver or gold or corruptible things, but he is a Spirit,
   and you, as you are spiritual beings, or as you have such in you, are
   his offspring." Certainly it is to be governed by the judgment of a
   fool in my choice, in my desires, in my estimation of things, to think
   that earthly things are the most valuable things, that carnal things
   (as the apostle calls them) are the most honourable things. No, without
   doubt those are the most honourable and most valuable things that are
   most God like, and by which I shall most resemble God. How was he taken
   with Solomon for his judgment and choice when he bids him ask what he
   would have! He was not such a fool as to go and ask riches, honour,
   long life, or the necks of his enemies, but begs for wisdom and
   understanding. This was most God like: and you see how God was pleased
   with his choice, how high an approbation he gives of it in that 1 Kings
   iii. 10, 11. And we should labour to govern our own judgment in these
   matters accordingly.

   And pray consider this with yourselves, and labour to feel the weight
   of it in your own spirits, if we do not covet and desire that God
   should create us according to his image and likeness, we shall
   certainly be apt to create to ourselves a god after our own image and
   likeness. That is, if we do not make it our business to have ourselves
   made like unto him, we shall be industrious to make him like to
   ourselves. As it is in the Psalmist, "Thou thoughtest that I was
   altogether such a one as thyself." A thing that will lead and plunge us
   into the deplorable estate of all sin and misery unavoidably.

LECTURE XXII. [11]

   Thirdly. It remains now that we go on to the third head of the
   communicable perfections of God, to wit, those of the divine will, or
   which we may otherwise call his moral perfections, and the most
   principal of them which I shall (but briefly too) speak of, are these
   four, to wit, his holiness, his justice, his faithfulness and his
   goodness. And before I speak to them severally, I shall give you some
   general considerations concerning them, and which will also partly
   respect some of those that have been spoken to already under the former
   heads. As,

   1. That when we distinguish the divine perfections into natural,
   intellectual and moral, the meaning is not as if those that were
   intellectual and moral were not also natural. But the first member in
   this distinction is larger and more comprehensive than the rest. All
   that are intellectual and moral are also natural perfections in the
   divine nature, but all that are natural are not intellectual and moral.
   And,

   2. We are to consider this concerning them, that the divine perfections
   which are spoken of under the notion of attributes, they do suppose
   their subject to be such, as to which they can and they must agree: we
   speak now only of a subject of denomination not of a subject of
   inhæsion in a proper sense. But they do all suppose their subject, that
   is of predication, to be a spiritual Being, or they do suppose God to
   be a Spirit, and might, all of them, be brought as proofs and
   demonstrations (if it were needful) that he is so. He could not be
   intelligent if he were not a spirit, nor righteous, nor holy, nor just,
   nor true, for all the e do suppose such a subject of predication as to
   which such attributes or attributed perfections can and must agree. And
   therefore (as hath been intimated formerly) when we speak of the
   attributes and perfections of God, this doth not come among them, but
   is presupposed and necessarily presupposed. Those that are properly
   called attributes are spoken of in quale quid, not in quid as schoolmen
   do fitly enough say, though I do not need to trouble you with the
   explication of those terms.

   3. You are to note this concerning them, that as they do suppose their
   suitable subject, so several of them do suppose others of them. As
   wisdom doth suppose knowledge, and holiness doth suppose wisdom; and
   justice, holiness, and faithfulness, justice, and so on. And again,

   4. We are to consider that our conception of God and his nature and the
   properties belonging thereunto, cannot possibly take up things
   otherwise than by parts: and so all our conceptions of him must be
   inadequate, and when we have taken up as much as is possible it is but
   a small portion that we have taken up, or can admit into our minds. And
   therefore, we are to conceive concerning all these perfections of God
   that though it be unavoidable to us to apprehend diversly, yet we must
   apprehend them as all falling into one most simple nature and being:
   whence it is not to be thought strange that we find a coincidence in
   very great part indiversive of these perfections, that do (as it were)
   fall and run into one another. As there will be more occasion to take
   notice in those particulars that are mentioned. And,

   5. You are to consider further that our notices of God must needs be in
   a great measure by reflection on ourselves. He hath been pleased to let
   us know that he created man at first after his own image. That is,
   after his natural image with the addition of his moral or holy image.
   And that he doth again regenerate and renew men after his own image,
   that is, his holy image, supposing the natural one, that being still
   supposed remaining, as the subject both of the corruption and of the
   restitution. This being so, we have the advantage of discerning much
   concerning the excellencies and perfections of the Divine Nature by
   reflecting upon ourselves. What we see by that reflection, we see as in
   a glass darkly, and indeed, when we are the glass we are a very dark
   one. But some resemblance, some image there is to be found, even with
   all there is the natural image of God, and with the regenerate there is
   the holy image renewed, though very imperfectly renewed, whereupon when
   we are to conceive of holiness, faithfulness, justice and goodness in
   God, our conception is much to be helped by these notions that we
   cannot but have of such things among men, these being, (as you have
   heard) of his communicable attributes that have the same name in him
   and in men, and the image and likeness of the same things. And,

   6. Though there be somewhat of the divine image or likeness in men, yet
   this similitude is not to be considered without very great
   dissimilitude. It is true indeed, omne simile est dissimile, every like
   is also unlike, but there must he most of all when we are to compare
   things in God and in us. Though there be some similitude, the
   dissimilitude must be vastly great which we are to take along with us
   in speaking of each of those mentioned perfections of the divine will,
   and so we come to the particulars. And,

   1. As to the HOLINESS OF GOD. That very term as it is applied to God,
   is of various significancy. And indeed, it is so as the term comes
   thence transferred unto creatures. Some times it signifies august,
   venerable, great, majestic. And the reason of the use of that phrase to
   such a purpose, that is, holy to signify august and venerable, is
   obvious: for as things that were holy were not to be violated, were not
   to be touched (as it were) by impure hands, not to be arrogated, not to
   be meddled with by any but those to whom they were appropriate, (in
   which respect, majesty hath been wont to be accounted a sacred thing
   that was not to be meddled with by any other, and the person a sacred
   person that was clothed therewith, not by any means in the world to be
   violated,) so with no very remote translation, holy or holiness being
   spoken of God doth signify the awfulness, the venerableness, of the
   Divine Nature. But yet, this is somewhat alien from holiness as it is a
   moral perfection: or as it is a perfection of the divine will. And
   therefore, as such we must consider it under its own proper and
   peculiar notion. It sometimes also, signifies firm, sure, unalterable.
   The sure mercies of David, (Isaiah lv.) the Septuagint renders it
   sacred, holy. But if we speak of holiness in the proper sense, as it is
   a perfection of the divine will, so it must needs, in the general
   notion, signify the rectitude of that will in all things, and so it
   must have two parts, a negative, and a positive part.

   (1.) A negative; and so the divine holiness stands in purity, in being
   most perfectly free from any taint or defilement, from any thing of
   moral turpitude, in any kind or any degree. And that purity, the
   negative rectitude of the divine will which is carried in his holiness,
   comprehends two things, first, an enmity from all irrectitude, any
   taint, any turpitude: and secondly, an abhorrence and detestation
   thereof. Not only that the nature and will of God hath nothing impure,
   or that is not right adhering to it; but doth also detest and abhor to
   have. It signifies the aversion of the divine will, its perpetual,
   inflexible aversion from every thing that is evil, unworthy of it,
   unbecoming to it. And so whereas, holiness is spoken of in Scripture
   under the notion of light, that light is said to be without darkness,
   in the first place, (1 John i. 5.) "God is light, and with him is no
   darkness at all." This is made the matter of solemn message to the sons
   of men: "And this is the message that we have from him and which we
   declare to you:" God hath sent this message to the world, this account
   of himself, that he is light and without any darkness at all, without
   the least mixture of any thing that is impure, or foul or unworthy of
   him. But then, as it is said in that place, speaking of the divine
   holiness under the notion of light, that it is without darkness: so it
   is, secondly, elsewhere, represented under the same notion as expulsive
   of it, declining it, hating it, as having with it a most inflexible and
   eternal aversion from every thing that is signified under the notion of
   darkness, unholiness being there signified by it. "What communion hath
   light with darkness?" It is drawn down to signify that there can be no
   communion between God and unholiness, the temple of God and idols. 2
   Cor. vi. 16. And,

   (2.) This holiness hath also its positive part which must comprehend
   two, the like things that have been mentioned concerning the negative
   part. That is, first the actual, perpetual rectitude of all his
   volitions, and all the works and actions that are consequent hereupon;
   and, secondly, an eternal propension thereunto, a love thereof, by
   which it is altogether impossible to that will, that it should ever
   vary from itself in this, as it can not in any other respect. That the
   determinations of that will are right in themselves, is out of
   question; and that, his word (and he best understands his own nature)
   testifies over and over. And then his propension, his eternal,
   unalterable propension of will to that which is right and good, that we
   find spoken of as a thing we must conceive too, as belonging to his
   holiness also; "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his
   countenance doth behold the upright." Psalm xi. 7. And so you have his
   hatred of all iniquity, and his love of universal rectitude, both
   mentioned together in one and the same breath, as it were; "Because
   thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity." (it is spoken of Christ
   it is true, but spoken of him as God, (Psalm xlv. 7.) having said
   immediately before, "Thy throne O God, is for ever and ever") therefore
   God, even thy God hath anointed thee." He is the image of God, the
   brightness of his glory, the express image of his person. But here it
   may be said, when we place (as we cannot but do) the notion of holiness
   generally in rectitude, every thing of rectitude must have some measure
   or another, or some rule to which it is to be referred, and which it is
   to be judged by. What is then the measure and will of divine rectitude
   wherein holiness stands? This is the thing that hath been very
   variously discussed, and with a great deal more perplexity than there
   was cause for. These things you may take about it, that are all plain
   in themselves, and will be as much as will need to be, or can, in sum
   and substance, be said to it. As,

   First. That the divine rectitude cannot be measured by any law, that
   refers to him properly so taken. A law properly taken, is the
   signification of the will of a superior concerning: an inferior. But it
   is out of question, God can have no superior, and so nothing can in a
   proper sense be a law to him. And a measure, it is prior to the thing
   measured, must be before it, but there can be nothing prior to God.
   Yet,

   Secondly. In the borrowed sense, very plain it is that God is a law to
   himself; and it is the only conception concerning this matter, that it
   can admit of: nor is that to be thought at all strange, when those
   parcels and fragments of right notion that are left in the ruined
   nature of man, do yet leave him a law to himself, where he hath no
   other law, no written law extant before him: much more, when the
   notions of rectitude are most perfect, they may supply the place of a
   rule or measure by which the divine rectitude is to be measured. But,

   Thirdly. His mere will, abstractly considered, cannot be this measure,
   as if the divine will might have made that which is right to be wrong,
   or that which is wrong to be right: this is altogether unconceivable
   and impossible, that that will, abstractly considered, should be to him
   the measure of right or wrong, or of good and evil. That is, as if one
   could suppose that an act of the will might alter the obligation that
   is upon an intelligent creature to love the best good; or could make it
   lawful or a duty to hate the highest and most perfect pulchritude and
   beauty. This cannot be: as we are told, it is impossible for God to
   lie. He cannot lie, as it is impossible to him to be unholy, as it is
   to be untrue. And therefore, that there are eternal reasons of moral
   good and evil is a most indubitable thing; that that which is right
   could not in its own nature, in the greatest instances but be so; and
   that thereupon, that the distinction must be admitted necessarily, of
   things that are good because God wills them, and of things that he
   wills be cause they are good. And so natural laws and positive, they
   come to have their distinction and diverse consideration. And then in
   the last place,

   Fourthly. That it is equally absurd to suppose, that the ideas of right
   and wrong, or of moral good and evil, as they are a measure to God
   should have place any where but in him; that is, in his will, not
   abstractly considered, but in his will as it is everlastingly conformed
   to a wise mind. There cannot but be an everlasting conformity between
   the rectitude of the divine will and the divine word. And whatsoever he
   doth, he doth all things not because he will, but according to the
   counsel of his will. Ephes. i. 11. And indeed, the contrary
   apprehension, were to resolve all the divine perfections into nothing
   but sovereignty. It is the divine will that is the measure of good and
   evil, yet not abstractly considered, but as it doth agree with most
   perfect wisdom, and that unalterably thereupon, it is as impossible to
   him ever to will that which is not wise, as it is impossible to him
   ever to speak that which is not true. And so far, having given some
   account of the divine holiness, wherein it lies, you may collect in
   great part from what hath been said, this double property of it, not to
   mention more:

   i. That his holiness is primary, all other holiness is but derivative,
   imparted. This is the fountain-holiness, the primary holiness. And,

   ii. His holiness is essential. It agrees to him, not primarily only,
   but essentially too, as being altogether inseparable from his nature.
   Holiness in any creature was always to it an extra-essential thing. We
   have had instances of it even in the higher orders of God's creatures.
   Man was created holy, but fell. Among the angels that were universally
   holy, many fell. So the holiness of the best of creatures is a thing in
   itself separable from its essence. But the divine holiness is most
   perfectly inseparable. I shall say no more upon this, (the course that
   I am upon did oblige me to great brevity in speaking to this head,) but
   only by way of Use.

   1. To recommend it to you, that we may live in the adoration of God,
   considered under this notion: "Who is like thee among the gods,
   glorious in holiness?" Exod. xv. 11. "There is none holy as the Lord,"
   as Hannah speaks in that admirable song of hers, 1 Sam. ii. 2. How
   should we rejoice in the thoughts of this, that we have such an Object
   of worship, so perfectly, unexceptionably holy. And,

   2. We ought to study the imitation of him herein, as the adoration of
   him upon this account, understanding the text as saying that to you,
   "Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" in holiness: "Be ye
   holy, for I am holy," 1 Pet. i. 15, 16, referred (for so it is written,
   as the apostle speaks) to that Levit. xi. 44. and in divers other
   places.

   3. Consider with what great gratitude the condescending goodness ought
   to be owned, that he should have a design to make such as we, like
   himself in this respect: we ought to acknowledge great kindness even in
   such a commandment, "Be ye holy for I am holy. I would fain have you
   like myself." It speaks great love and good will to us, that he would
   have us imitate him. And,

   4. It should make us willingly submit to any methods that he thinks fit
   to use, to bring us to that conformity to him in this respect; that we
   be gradually perfected herein, as he is most perfect. The state of our
   case requires that his methods should be sometimes rough and severe for
   this purpose. We have a great deal of dross about us. The fathers of
   our flesh, indeed, they correct (saith the apostle, Heb. xii. 9) "after
   their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers
   of his holiness." A great word and work, (and which we ought to
   consider accordingly) that we might be partakers of his holiness! that
   is, that he might transform us into his image and likeness. What
   difficulties, what furnaces, what fires, what deaths would we not go
   through for this, that we might be made partakers of his holiness, to
   be in this respect, #s he is, perfect.

   2. The next that I have mentioned of these four perfections of the
   divine will, is his JUSTICE. And justice is wont to be distinguished
   into universal and particular. But then,

   (I.) As universal righteousness or justice doth comprehend particular
   justice in it, so it superadds somewhat distinguishing, as you shall
   see by and by. Therefore,

   (2.) For particular justice, that is twofold. It is either commutative
   or distributive; for commutative justice, with God it can have no
   place, because he hath no equal: or there are none of the same order
   with him, that can make exchanges with him or that can transfer rights
   to him for any rights transferred from him: he can be debtor to none of
   his creatures. Who hath given him any thing, and it shall be
   recompensed to him again?" as Rom. xi. 35. It is a challenge to all the
   world. But it. is that part of particular justice, which is wont to be
   called distributive justice that properly agrees to him, that is,
   rectoral justice, magistratical justice, the justice of a governor,
   ruler, of a superior towards an inferior. And that useth to be divided
   into these two parts, praemiative and puniative: praemiative, that
   confers rewards, and puniative, that dispenseth punishments. For the
   former of these, whatsoever rewards God dispenseth must be all of
   grace, not at all of debt. He cannot be antecedently a debtor to his
   creatures, otherwise than by promise, and so his justice runs into his
   faithfulness, as you will see by and by. And supposing him to have
   bound himself by promise, then it is a piece of justice with him to
   make good his promise, and thereupon, the notion of righteousness doth
   obtain and take place, even in conferring benefits. "God is not
   unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love." Heb. vi. 10. And
   "it is a righteous thing with God," not only to "recompense
   tribulation" to the troublers of his people, but also, those that are
   troubled rest with him. 2 Thess. i. 6, 7And "if we confess our sins, he
   is faithful and just to forgive us our sins." There is a piece of
   justice in it. It is, upon one account, the highest act of mercy
   imaginable, considering with what liberty and freedom the course and
   method were settled, wherein sins come to be pardoned: and it is an act
   of justice also, inasmuch as it is the observation of a method to which
   he had tied himself, and from which afterwards therefore, he cannot
   depart, cannot vary.

   And then for punitive justice, this is most distinguishing of the
   justice of God, from his holiness abstractly considered. By his
   holiness he hates sin, and by justice he punisheth it. The one makes
   him hate it, the other obligeth him to animadvert upon it in a way of
   punishment, or inclines him to do so. And this he doth as a debtor to
   himself. Justice among creatures is conversant about the rights of
   other men; but in God it must be conversant about his own rights;
   because he is himself the Fountain of all rights. And there could be no
   such thing as right throughout the whole universe, if it had not its
   first fountain in God himself: and therefore, his justice must be the
   faithful guardian of the rights of his sovereignty and government, And
   thereupon, this justice doth not only allow him but oblige him to award
   to every transgression a just recompense of reward, as the Scripture
   speaks.

   But of this, I shall say no more, save only, this word or two by way of
   Use, that is,

   1 Let us have our souls so possessed with this apprehension of the
   divine justice as to dread it, and stand in great awe of it, knowing
   that we have to do with a God that will not be mocked, or trifled with
   by any; and who never confers favours upon any, so as to forget his
   just right; nor doth so exercise his mercy towards any as to depress
   and lose his sovereignty; of which sovereignty of his, as hath been
   said, his justice must always be a faithful guardian, and therefore,
   those that are nearest to him must know that if they transgress, his
   justice must have an exercise about them, even as punitive. There is
   such a thing as economical, punitive, family justice, by which, even
   where God is pleased to be related as a Father, he animadverts upon,
   and chastises and punishes the faults and follies of his own children,
   even those that are of his own house hold. Though you must distinguish
   of punishments, between those that are corrective and those that are
   vindictive, Vindictive punishments shall not have place there upon
   those that are, and have, a stated being in the family, that are of it
   and in it. But corrective punishment shall have place even there. And
   then, Not only dread divine justice, hut labour to engage it to be on
   your side. What a great blessing is that, to have even justice itself
   plead for us, and the state of our case brought to that pass that it
   may. If we confess our sins, that is, with a truly evangelical frame of
   spirit, he is faithful and just to for give us our sins: and the blood
   of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sin. But I pass on,

   3. To say somewhat of his FAITHFULNESS. And that also doth in great
   part run into justice, as justice doth in some part run into holiness.
   But so far as to superadd somewhat peculiar and distinguishing. The
   faithfulness of God is his veracity or his truth as it relates to his
   word, the conformity that is between his word and his mind. And
   whereas, his word, as his faithfulness that refers to it is twofold,
   assertory and promissory; so accordingly, must his faithfulness be
   understood. It stands either in declaring to us truly how things are,
   or how they shall be. It relates to his assertory word; that is, that
   he doth make a true representation to us of all things that are to be
   received by us as doctrines. Whereas, he is in no possibility of being
   deceived himself herein, so neither can he deceive us; God cannot lie.
   It is impossible to God to lie. So much, the light of a pagan could
   discern of God, even Balaam; "God is not a man that he should lie, nor
   the son of man that he should repent." All the declarations that he
   hath made to us by way of assertion of things that we are to conceive
   are so and so, we are to look upon his truth and faithfulness as
   engaged herein. That is, he doth make a representation to us of things
   just as they are, and no otherwise, in what he saith to us of himself,
   in what he saith to us of Christ, in what he saith to us of his Spirit,
   and in what he saith to us of the way and course of duty wherein we are
   to walk, and the like. And whereas, our Lord Jesus Christ is the
   Revealer, the first Revealer of God and his mind to men, he is
   thereupon, called the faithful witness, as representing and testifying
   things just to be as they are, and no otherwise. It comes in among his
   glorious titles, "Jesus Christ, the first begotten from the dead, the
   Prince of the kings of the earth, the faithful witness:" that falls in
   among the rest. Rev. i. 5. God's name is in him, that is, the same
   nature is in him where of the divine name is expressive. And therefore,
   in the whole gospel revelation we must conceive the highest
   faithfulness to be engaged. That which sums it up, "Jesus Christ came
   into the world to save sinners," the apostle calls it "a faithful
   saying, and worthy of all acceptation," (1 Tim. i. 15) most worthy to
   be received and believed. And then,

   The word of God, to which this faithfulness hath reference is not only
   assertory but promissory; not only declaratory how things are, but how
   also they shall be. It is true, we may take in his threatenings too,
   unto which his faithfulness hath reference as well as his promises. But
   chiefly and principally, his faithfulness hath reference to his
   covenant. "He is the faithful God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for
   ever." Deut. vii. 9. And "he will not alter the covenant that is gone
   out of his mouth, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail." Psalm lxxxix.
   33, 34.

   And therefore, concerning this also, take so much of present Use. Is
   God perfect in this respect, most perfectly true and faithful, true to
   his word, his mind always agreeing most accurately with it? Then,

   1. Trust this faithfulness of his. The object of trust is faithfulness
   most properly, the most immediate object. That which answers to
   faithfulness is faith. If he be faithful, he is to be believed, trusted
   in, and relied upon. In that passage of the apostle's prayer that he
   might be delivered from wicked and unreasonable men, for all men have
   not faith; the most probable meaning of that, is, that have not
   faithfulness, (faith being there taken objectively,) that are not fit
   to be trusted; wicked and unreasonable men, upon whom we can place no
   trust, that are not fit to be believed. But we are never to admit a
   thought so diminishing or debasing concerning him whom we have taken to
   be our God, as if he were not fit to be trusted, as if his faithfulness
   could fail any whit. Our heavenly Father is perfect in this respect;
   therefore trust him perfectly, without vacillation, without wavering or
   suspenseful hearts. He cannot deny himself, he abides most faithful and
   therefore most securely to be relied upon by those that are, through
   his grace, enabled to give up themselves to him. He desires no more:
   give up yourselves to him, and you are safe on his part: rely upon him,
   for he is faithful; he will keep what you commit to him. And,

   2. Imitate his faithfulness as well as trust it. Do you labour to be
   perfect herein? I pray let us all labour to be perfect in this as our
   heavenly Father is perfect, to wit, in faithfulness, both towards him
   and towards men

   (1.) Towards him, O! how can we think it tolerable to break with him
   who is never apt to break with us! His faithfulness can never fail, why
   should ours so often fail? When we promise, when we engage, when we vow
   to live in his love, in his fear, in his communion; what shame should
   it cover our faces with, to be unfaithful towards him, who is
   constantly faithful towards us. And,

   (2.) Towards men; imitate him there too: this would be the glory of our
   religion. It is the intolerable reproach of it, that there is so much
   falsehood among men, and even among them that profess the Christian
   name, among them who pretend to God as their God: saying he is their
   God who is the faithful God, most perfectly faithful. This makes a most
   deplorable state of things. "Help Lord" (saith the Psalmist) "for the
   faithful man faileth." Psalm xii. 1. It makes the state of things so
   very dismal that all who understand themselves, think they have reason
   to cry to heaven, "Help, help, in such a sad case as this." Help, Lord,
   the godly man fails, there is no faithfulness left in the world. We are
   undone in this case if God do not help, if we have not help from
   heaven. But what an ornament is it to the Christian name and
   profession, when the very words of such and such as do profess it, are
   reckoned stable as a pillar of brass. "I would no more distrust such a
   man's word, than I would fear the falling of the heavens over me, or
   the sinking of the earth under me:" this would be the glory of our
   religion. O! then let us labour to be perfect in this respect as our
   heavenly Father is perfect.

LECTURE XXIII. [12]

   Having discoursed from this text, of many of the divine perfections,
   under the distinct heads of the perfections of the Divine Nature, of
   the Divine Mind, and of the Divine Will: and as for those of this last
   rank, having discoursed to you of several others, it remains to say
   something yet,

   4. Of the DIVINE GOODNESS; where, by goodness I do not mean the
   goodness of being merely, or the goodness of this or that thing in its
   own particular kind; nor moral goodness in the utmost extent and
   latitude of it, for that would comprehend the several other perfections
   of the divine will, that have been spoken to already; but one branch
   thereof only, which commonly goes under the name of benignity; a benign
   inclination of will, which we are to consider, both with respect of
   what it excludes, and in respect of what it includes.

   (1.) In respect of what it excludes: it excludes what is opposite to
   it, whether it be contrarily opposite, or contradictory. That which is
   contrarily opposite is an aptness to do hurt, a mischievous disposition
   to have a mind or will prone to the doing of mischief; which it most
   certainly excludes: and then, that which is contradictorily opposite
   is, not to be willing to do good, an unaptness to do good.

   (2.) And so, accordingly, it doth include a general propensity to
   benefaction, to acts of beneficence, and so we are to consider the
   goodness of God anologically to what we can find of any like specimen
   among men; for indeed, much of our way of knowing God is by reflection,
   there being somewhat of God yet left and remaining in man, fragments,
   broken relics of that image first instamped upon the soul of man in his
   creation. And by them it is, that we form the general notion, even of
   those perfections which we do ascribe to God. We see the several
   features of that image, by reflection, as in a glass, on which we
   bestow such and such names. Though in the mean time we must know, (as
   hath been told you upon other occasions over and over,) that whatsoever
   there is that goes under the same name with God and with us, (as all
   his communicable attributes do,) yet the things must be infinitely
   diverse, as his being and ours cannot but be. It is but some shadow,
   some faint resemblance, of the divine perfections that are discernible
   in us. But upon those things we bestow these names, still apprehending,
   that under the same name somewhat infinitely more perfect hath its
   place and being in God.

   And now, as to this perfection, (the divine benignity,) I purposely
   reserved that to the last place, because it is most in the eye and
   design of this text, as is very manifest if you look back but to the
   two more immediate paragraphs, which do mote directly refer hither, the
   former of them more expressly signifying that vacancy that should be in
   us, (in conformity to the divine pattern and example,) of all
   inclination to do evil, and the latter, positively expressing and
   holding forth the inclination that should be in us, after the same
   example, to do good. Of the former of these paragraphs you may look
   downwards from ver. 38, and see how the design of that, runs against a
   mischievous temper and disposition of spirit, an aptness to do evil,
   yea, though provoked; that there must be no disposition to retaliate,
   to requite evil with evil, wrong with wrong, injury with injury: but
   rather than do so, suffer oneself to be injured more, as the several
   expressions in that paragraph do signify, which it is not needful here
   to consider.

   And then for the latter paragraph, concerning the disposition to do
   good, the discourse of that, runs from ver. 43 to this conclusion and
   close of the chapter; all under the name of love; so extensive and
   large in reference to its object, as not to exclude enemies themselves;
   those that do with the most bitter hate pursue and persecute us, "You
   have heard it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate
   thine enemy;" such undue limits have been wont to be put and assigned
   to your love; that you acquit yourselves well enough if you do love
   them that love you, and if you do good turns to them that do such to
   you, if you carry it courteously and affably in your salutations to
   such as will salute you. But this is a mean and narrow spirit, unworthy
   of a christian, and unworthy of the name and design of Christianity,
   that being intended to restore man to man, to restore man to himself,
   to make man what he was, and what he should be. There are no such
   limitations as those to be made to our love; it must reach enemies,
   enemies themselves. "I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that
   curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that
   despitefully use and persecute you;" and all this, that you may be
   perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect; (for so he doth,) "that
   you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he
   maketh his sun to rise upon the evil and upon the good, and sends his
   rain upon the just and upon the unjust;" animadverting upon it as a
   mean thing; and an argument of a base and narrow spirit, to have our
   love and kindness confined to those wonted limits, wherein men,
   otherwise taught by their own corrupt inclinations, are wont to confine
   theirs. This is, therefore, the main and more principal design of this
   text, as it refers to the context, to commend to us the divine
   benignity, to represent that, and to set it before us as a pattern to
   which we are to be conformed. Be in this respect perfect as your
   heavenly Father is perfect.

   And indeed, it is the fittest to consider this divine perfection in the
   last place; for it is (as it were) the perfecting perfection; it crowns
   and consummates all the rest. All the excellencies of the Divine Being,
   they are to be considered not abstractly, each by itself, but as they
   refer to one another, and as all together they do make one admirable
   temperament; as with reverence we may speak. Indeed, of those that are
   abstractly considered, that are wont to go under the notion with us of
   very great exercise, should be all separated from this, they lose
   themselves, lose their very name; wisdom, apart] from goodness, it were
   only an ability to contrive, power, apart from goodness were only an
   ability to execute ill purposes and designs. But divine wisdom, that is
   in conjunction with most perfect goodness: and divine power, that is in
   conjunction with the most perfect goodness: and so this is, (as I may
   say,) the perfecting perfection, consummating of all the rest. How
   admirable a thing is that wisdom that is continually prompted by
   goodness! and that power) that is continually set on work by goodness,
   in all the efforts and exertions of it!

   And now, in speaking to this, the divine benignity and goodness, I
   shall briefly point out unto you the various diversifications of it,
   and then lay before you some of the more observable exemplifications of
   it. I shall shew you how it is diversified, and wherein it is
   exemplified.

   [1.] How it is diversified. It admits, in sundry respects, {which I
   shall mention to you,) of sundry considerations and notions that may be
   put upon it, which yet do all run into this one thing, goodness. First,
   as it imports a propension unto any thing of suitableness, according as
   the estimate of divine wisdom and liberty doth determine it, and so it
   goes under the name of love. Love, is nothing else but a propension
   towards this or that object. The objects towards which divine goodness
   is propense, they are estimated by his wisdom and liberty, or
   sovereignty in conjunction, in respect of their capacities to receive
   these his propensions, or to be the passive subjects thereof: secondly,
   as it refers to offenders, guilty creatures, so this goodness is his
   clemency: thirdly, as it refers to repeated offences, so it is
   patience: fourthly, as it refers to long continued and often repeated
   provocations, so it is long suffering, forbearance: fifthly, as it
   refers to a miserable object, so it is pity and compassion: sixthly, as
   it refers to an amiable object, so it is complacency and delight:
   seventhly, as it refers to an indigent object, and speaks large
   benefactions towards it, so it is bounty: and lastly, as it refers to
   the principle of liberty and spontaneity from whence it proceeds, so it
   is called grace, eudokia, the very expression that is used to signify
   the goodness of the will, when, without any kind of inducement, good is
   done for goodness' sake. C( Thou art good and doest good." When there
   is nothing to oblige, nothing to requite, nothing to remunerate,
   nothing to invite, this is the graciousness of goodness. These are
   sundry diversifications, (as they may fitly enough be called) and one
   and the same excellency, divine goodness and benignity, raised
   according as such and such respects (as have been mentioned) do clothe
   it. But then,

   [2.] We come to give you exemplifications of it, in instances evidences
   that do recommend and shew it forth unto us. And,

   First. The most obvious and most comprehensive one is, this very
   creation itself which we behold, and whereof we ourselves are a little,
   inconsiderable part. What else can be supposed to have been the
   inducement to an infinite, self-sufficient, all-sufficient Being to
   make such a creation as this stand forth out of nothing, but an immense
   goodness, a benignity not to be prescribed unto, and was only its own
   reason to itself, of what it would design and do? The creation could
   add nothing to him; for it being produced out of nothing, it could have
   nothing in it, but what was of him and from him; and so there is
   nothing of being in it; nothing of excellency and perfection in it, but
   what was originally and eminently in himself before; for nothing could
   give that which it had not: and all that is in this world, is given out
   from God himself, and therefore, it is resolvable into nothing else but
   mere goodness that we are, or that any thing else besides is. As in
   Rev. iv. 11. "For thy pleasure all things are and were created." For
   thy pleasure; it was a pleasure to him to have that immense and
   boundless goodness of his, issue and flow forth in such a creation: and
   among the rest of creatures, in giving being to such as might be
   capable of knowing who made them, and of contemplating the glorious
   excellencies of their Maker, and of partaking a felicity in him, as
   well as a being from him. Indeed, that there should be so vast a
   creation, (though all that is nothing compared with him, vast as it
   is,) that is owing to his power; that there should so ornate and
   amiable and orderly a frame of things be created, that is owing to his
   wisdom. But that there should be any creation at all, that is owing to
   nothing else but his mere goodness. He would have creatures that should
   be capable of knowing and enjoying the excellencies and perfections
   that make up his being to himself, according to their measure and
   capacities; and he would have other creatures of inferior ranks and
   orders to minister unto them. And though this be an obvious thing, and
   we hear of it often, it is often in our minds, yet I am afraid it is
   not often enough in our hearts. It doth not sink and pierce deep into
   our souls, to think what we, by mere nature, are, by mere untainted
   uncorrupt nature; all that we are by divine benignity, that it did
   eternally depend upon his mere pleasure whether I should be something
   or nothing. And what a rebuke would this carry in it to a vain mind, if
   it might be seriously and often thought of! "Was I created to indulge
   and pursue vanity, to indulge a vain mind, and pursue vain things?" how
   great an awe would it hold our spirits under! It would teach us to fear
   the Lord and his goodness, to think, "I only am, and have a place in
   this world, because he thought it good, and he saw it good to have it
   so." But,

   Secondly. The universal sustentation that he affords to all created
   beings, generally considered: this is all nothing but mere goodness;
   for as he had no need of a creation at first, he hath still no need of
   it, and he that hath raised it up into being out of nothing one moment,
   might have suffered all to slip and lapse into nothing the next moment
   again, without injury to what he had made, or without loss to himself.
   His tender mercy is over all his works. He lets all this great variety
   of creatures that replenish this world, continually draw from him. The
   eyes of all things look towards him. Nature hath (as it were) set an
   eye in every thing that is made, only to look up with craving looks to
   the great Author of all things, and all are sustained suitably as their
   indigent states require, when all are still useless to him, and
   advantage him nothing. But,

   Thirdly. His continual sparing offending creatures; how constant a
   testimony and evidence is this of the immense goodness of God! That
   when he hath those that offend him continually, in his power and at his
   mercy, and he may right himself for what hath been done, in a moment,
   or prevent doing any thing more to his displeasure, and to his
   dishonour, yet he spares: how admirable goodness is this! It is not
   oscitancy and neglect, as if he took no notice of what men did. On
   purpose to obviate such an expression, Moses useth that emphatical
   expression, (interceding for offending Israel,) "Let the power of my
   God be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is
   long-suffering and slow to anger." Let the power of my God be great. It
   is not from oscitancy but power, that guilty creatures are spared, that
   an offending world is riot turned into flames and ashes long ago; that
   a vindictive fire hath not been preying on it, and vindicating the
   wrong done to the offended Maker and Lord of all. It is not oscitancy
   but power, that is, power over himself, the greatest of all powers.
   Creating power is less, the sustentative power, by which the world is
   borne up, is less. By the exertion of his power towards his creatures
   lip can easily conquer them; but by this exercise of his power he doth,
   (as it were,) conquer himself; withholding himself from those more
   sudden eruptions of displeasure and wrath which would argue that these
   were a predominant thing with him. But he will let the world know it is
   not so. There is the power of goodness that doth predominate and is
   governing. It is admirable in itself, and ought to be so in our
   estimate, that this world which hath for so many thousand years been
   inhabited and possessed by rebels against the crown and throne and
   dignity of the Eternal King, is yet spared, and they let propagate
   their kind, and transmit their nature, though they do, with it,
   transmit the poison and malignity of an inveterate hate and enmity
   against the Author of their being. How admirable is the divine
   goodness, that shews itself in this patience and long-suffering towards
   a guilty world! We are taught so to account; "Despisest thou the riches
   of his forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of
   God leadeth thee to repentance? Rom. ii. 4. And again,

   Fourthly. We are to consider as a further instance and evidence of this
   immense goodness of God, that he is pleased to take such care of the
   children of men, in their several successive ages and generations, as
   we find he continually doth; not only sparing them but providing for
   them; which is a plain and most constantly positive instance and
   exemplification of this goodness whereof we speak. Two ways he doth
   more especially take care of the offending creatures that do possess
   and inhabit this earth of ours; partly by laws, and partly by
   providence.

   i. By laws. How much of the goodness of God is seen by those very laws
   which he hath taken care shall have place in this world, and by which
   any thing of common order is preserved? How admirable is it that he
   should so concern himself for the tranquillity and peace and welfare of
   those that are in a confederacy and combination against him, and have
   been so from one generation to another! How wonderful is it! It is
   owing, partly, to the impressions he hath made and left upon the minds
   and nature of man, that there are any such laws as go under the name of
   the laws of nature, which have this tendency and design, to keep the
   world in a peaceful and quiet state; and do so, as far as they obtain
   and prevail. And indeed, there is none that do any thing to the
   disturbance and disquiet of the world, but they abandon the law of
   their nature in what they do, and offer violence to themselves. But any
   such law of nature we must understand to have proceeded from the Author
   of nature, and we must understand it to have been, preserved and kept
   alive among men, by him that doth preserve the nature of man, and doth
   take care that there should be successions of such creatures in this
   world. Consider how tender he is of the life of man, that he hath
   provided, that there should be such a law, even in man's nature,
   against murder, of which the municipal laws of several countries are
   all transcripts, and all owing to the general Legislator. Whatsoever
   laws of this or that country do agree with the natural law, they are
   all from the supreme Legislator, and are but discoveries of the care
   and concern that the common Ruler of this world hath to preserve such a
   creature as man on earth, from violence and wrong. And so likewise, the
   laws that do obtain anywhere for the preservation of property and for
   the preservation of chastity, and for the preservation of fame and
   reputation among men, and the like; that men may not be injured in such
   respects: they are all so many instances and exemplifications of the
   great and general benignity of the common Lord and Author of all
   things, towards his poor creatures in this world, though he beheld his
   nature poisoned with enmity and malignity against himself, and though
   that creature takes no notice of him in all this. And then,

   ii. The case is seen, not only in the provision he hath made by laws,
   but which he continually makes by providence, for the sustentation of
   these, his offending creatures. So you see the text refers us to these
   very instances, "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, pray
   for them that despitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be
   the children of your Father which is in heaven:" that you may represent
   and shew forth the Divine Nature in yourselves, that you may shew
   yourselves born of God, with such a nature as God hath; give some
   proofs and discoveries of the Divine Nature in you, be cause he doth
   thus; loves his enemies, doth good to them that hate him, feeds them
   with breath, with bread, with all the necessary supports of life, in a
   continual course from day to day. And again,

   Fifthly. It doth further evidence and exemplify divine goodness, and
   how perfect he is therein, that there is any derivation hereof to be
   found any where among men, that there is any such thing among men as
   goodness towards one another, in any degree of if. Wheresoever there is
   to be found more or less of that which we call good nature, if there be
   any thing of humanity, of an aptness to do good to others, or an
   unaptness to do them hurt, or to take pleasure in their infelicities or
   miseries, these are so many specimens of goodness that are derived, and
   their very derivation speaks a fountain from whence they come. There
   can be no borrowed or participated goodness but must suppose, and
   imply, a first goodness whence it proceeds. If there be any, the least
   goodness in any creature, this refers us to God, prompts us to look
   towards him with adoring eyes. This is a little rivulet from an immense
   ocean, a beam, a ray from that Sun of love and goodness, from that
   Nature that is all goodness and all love itself, in the very essence of
   it. This we ought to consider, if we meet with any kindness in this
   world, if we see any efforts, any discoveries of pity, of compassion
   and mercifulness in one towards another, this is all goodness from the
   First Goodness. All this, shews there is one Immense Goodness, whence
   all such little parcels of goodness do proceed and come. Even in this
   apostate and fallen world we see some such appearances of the divine
   image, (as was said) yet left. We see man hath love in his nature,
   something of goodness in his nature, a proneness to do acts of goodness
   and beneficence to some or other, as they come in his way: this should
   presently make us fall adoring the Supreme Goodness in all this. But
   then,

   Sixthly. The design of recovering apostate, fallen man, is beyond all
   things, a most admirable discovery of divine goodness; that ever he
   should have formed such a design. Here is such a creature, such an
   order of creatures, such a sort of creatures, fallen, sunk, lost,
   become miserable, and miserable by their own delinquency, by their own
   apostasy, that is, by their own choice: they have chosen the way that
   leads down to the chambers of death and eternal ruin. Now, that in this
   case he should form a design with himself, "I will yet settle a course
   wherein such creatures as these may be recovered and saved, even from a
   self-procured ruin." If there were not, I say, a goodness whereof no
   other account could be given, but that it is divine, but that it is of
   itself, as the Deity is, as the Godhead is; who would ever have
   imagined but that such creatures having offended, and by their
   offensive nature and course, put themselves into a way of perishing,
   must have been let perish. Nothing more was needful than to let them
   perish. Why should they not be let perish, when they chose it, when
   they loved it, and affected the way to it? "They that hate me love
   death." They that hated wisdom, the Supreme Wisdom, they loved death.
   And why might they not be left to their own choice, to take the things
   they love? No, this was Godlike, this speaks the goodness of a God,
   that he will prevent the perishing of self-destroying creatures. "Their
   destruction is of themselves, but they shall find that in me is their
   help;" as by the prophet he speaks his own mind and heart. Partly, the
   design itself, of saving and recovering such creatures, and partly, the
   strange and most surprising methods for bringing about such a design,
   may not only beget conviction, but the highest admiration also, of the
   goodness of God. We should not only acknowledge it, but fall a
   wondering, and even lose ourselves in wonder. How unaccountable a
   goodness was this, that rather than such creatures as we, should
   finally and remedilessly perish, God should put on man, become man:
   that roan, a man of sorrows; that man of sorrows, at last a sacrifice
   on a cross, to bring about a reconciliation between an offended Majesty
   and offending creatures? What manner of love was this! what a
   transporting discovery of divine goodness! "God so loved the, world,
   that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life." John iii. 16. But then,
   if we add in the next place, to all this,

   Seventhly. The various means that he useth to draw and gather in souls,
   to comply with the terms upon which pardon and reconciliation, and
   eternal salvation are offered to us. There are his ensigns displayed,
   there is a gospel published, there is an office set on foot, which is
   to last through all ages to the end of time, on purpose to draw and
   gather in souls; and all these to be looked upon still under the notion
   of enemies, they whose hearts were full of enmity and hate against him.
   For whom indeed he hath been doing good, in common kinds, long before:
   but they never thanked him for all the actings of his patience and
   sparing mercy. But such things are continually done towards the
   unthankful and the evil; yea, these he is so intent upon saving from a
   deserved ruin, and bringing them to partake, even in a blessedness with
   himself, to unite them with his Son, make them one with him, to possess
   them with his Spirit; and to one of the greatest wonders of the divine
   goodness that can be thought of. When he hath given his Son to be a
   sacrifice for poor sinners, then to give his Spirit to enter into them,
   and to inhabit and possess them, and dwell in them; that holy, pure
   Spirit, that Spirit of all goodness and purity, that Spirit of
   holiness, as he is called, that he should make his entrance into unholy
   souls, souls that are so many cells of impurity and filthiness, of
   every thing that is hateful and noisome and loathsome, how admirable a
   discovery is this of the divine goodness!

LECTURE XXIV. [13]

   And having thus demonstrated the divine goodness, my design is to
   vindicate it. And that is, indeed, of so great importance, that I
   cannot think it fit to leave off from this subject without placing some
   endeavour that way. It is of the greatest consequence to us, in all the
   world, to have our souls habitually possessed with a believing,
   admiring sense of the goodness of God. We should therefore watch with
   greater jealousy over our souls, in no one point more than this, lest
   any thought should arise, or lest any injection should fix and have
   place in our souls, that should any way tend to infer with us a
   diminution of the goodness of God, that the glory of it should be
   sullied in our eyes, or that it should be obscured or darkened in any
   kind: for how much may a thought do of prejudice to that genuine, holy,
   spiritual affection that should be working back again in ourselves
   towards a good God? How may that affection be stifled by a thought, if
   it be not duly and seasonably obviated!

   And indeed, there are but these two great objections that can, with any
   plausibleness, offer themselves against the goodness of God; partly,
   the eternal miseries that do befal the greater part of mankind; and
   partly, the temporal calamities that do befal the better part. These
   two ways, men may object to themselves against the divine goodness,
   wherein God is here represented as so perfect, that the most should
   miserably perish, and the best should undergo many hard and grievous
   things, even in this world. Both these, we shall take into
   consideration, that so, this most necessary part of the idea of the
   divine perfections may obtain, without any kind of obstruction or
   objection lying against it in our minds or hearts; so as we may yield
   ourselves to be entirely swallowed up of the divine goodness.

   The former of these is more frequent. And to shew how little pretence
   there can be from thence, how little colour of objection against the
   divine goodness, I shall lay before you these many considerations:

   1. That no such goodness can be as a perfection in God, that shall
   exclude or diminish any of his other perfections. No such goodness can
   belong to the nature of God, as any perfection due to it, that shall be
   exclusive or diminishing of any other perfection. You should not praise
   a man, but reproach him, if you should give this of him as his
   character, that he is so very goodnatured, as never to make any
   difference between civilities and affronts.

   2. Punitive justice is most certainly a perfection belonging to the
   nature of God, both as he is a Being universally perfect, and as he is
   the Ruler of the world, to be exercised in such cases, wherein there is
   occasion it should have place. This is plain in itself, punitive
   justice to be exercised where it ought to have place, it is a
   perfection belonging to the nature of God as he is a Being of universal
   perfection, and the Ruler of the world: as indeed, the Original Being,
   the First of beings must include all perfection eminently in itself.
   For there is no perfection that is not somewhat, and there is no
   something that can come from nothing, and therefore, the First Being
   must have all perfection in it. And if this be a perfection, (as every
   man's judgment will tell him it is,) that is, punitive justive, to be
   exercised upon proper occasions, it cannot but have place in the Divine
   Nature, as he is a Being of universal perfection, and as it necessarily
   belongs to him, supposing a world, to be the Governor of it. It could
   be from no other but him; and therefore, can be under no government but
   his.

   3. There can be no place for the exercise of punitive justice, but in
   reference to creatures governable by a law. Punitive justice can never
   have place, but towards such creatures as do admit of being governed by
   a law. Punishment is, properly, nothing else but due animadversion upon
   an offender against the law to which, he is obliged, and which he is
   put under. This also is plain in itself, and only leads to what I add
   further,

   4. That no creature can be capable of government by a law, but such a
   one as is endowed with the natural faculties of an understanding and a
   will. There is no place for a legal government, and so nor,
   consequently, for the exercise of punitive justice, but toward a
   creature that is endowed with the natural faculties of an understanding
   and will, supposing that such a creature be guilty of violating the
   laws by which he ought to be governed.

   5. It can be no reflection upon the nature of God to have made such a
   creature as man. For that which is the very first instance of divine
   goodness, it would be very strange that that should be a reflection
   upon it, cloud it, or obscure it. It evidenceth it most highly, that
   when it was in the choice of God, and a thing merely depending upon his
   pleasure, to make such a sort and order of creatures stand up out of
   nothing into being. This is, I say, the first evidence of his goodness,
   and speaks nothing to the disparagement of it: "for thy pleasure all
   things are and were created." And that which ought, from the very
   reason of the thing, to be matter of highest and most grateful
   acknowledgment and adoration, must thereupon, necessarily, be an
   instance of goodness in him to whom such grateful acknowledgments are
   due, and by whom they are claimed. And it is a saying that carries its
   own light and reason in it, of that ancient, that "If I were capable
   (saith he) of making an intelligent creature stand up out of nothing,
   with a present power of using and understanding, the first thing I
   should expect from him should be, that he fall down and worship me, and
   make acknowledgment to me, for having been the author of being, and of
   such a being to him." And then, for the kind of this being which divine
   goodness hath allotted to it, it makes it a high instance of his
   goodness itself. So far is it from being a diminution to it, that is,
   that he hath given us such a sort of being that is merely imitative and
   resembling of his own, wherein could there have been a greater
   signification of kindness and goodness, than to form a creature after
   his own image, with a spiritual, intelligent nature like his own? And,

   6. The things that render any creature capable of felicity, do also
   render it capable of government by a law: that is, reason and will, an
   intellective and elective faculty; these make a people capable of
   government by a law, and make them capable of felicity too. As hath
   been told you, if man had not had a nature endowed with an
   understanding and a will, he could have been no capable subject of
   being governed by a law: but then, if he had been destitute of such
   faculties as these, he could not have been capable of felicity neither.
   If he had not understanding to apprehend wherein it lies, and a will to
   unite with it, choose it, and take solace in it, he would be incapable
   of being a happy creature. And what! Can it be any argument against the
   divine goodness that he hath made man with such a nature as renders him
   capable of felicity? If he were not capable of government, he could not
   be capable of felicity; the same things making him capable of the one,
   and of the other.

   7. It must have been a very great blemish upon the divine government,
   if creatures capable of government by law, should generally offend
   against the most righteous and equal ones, (as his laws cannot but be,)
   and there should be no course taken for the punishing of such
   transgressors. This must be a manifest blemish upon a government.
   Suppose we, in any government whatsoever that there should be any such
   edict and proclamation published, that let the subjects under such a
   government do what they please, no man shall be animadverted upon, all
   shall do what is good in their own eyes, and no one be ever called to
   any account; would this be a commendation of a government? Such a thing
   is altogether insupposable in the ad ministration of the best and most
   excellent government that ever was, or ever can be. Consider it in the
   whole course of it, not the temporal administration abstractly, from
   the future state of things, but the course and the end of it
   altogether; and it must finally appear the best and most perfect and
   excellent government that ever was, or ever can be. But how
   insupposable is it, (I say) that the best and most perfect government,
   should ever be liable to such a blemish as this, that let men be never
   so wicked, it shall fare as well with them as if they were never so
   dutiful and obedient. The thing speaks itself, and Scripture speaks it,
   but it speaks not as a notion which it suggests anew, but only that
   which it takes up and observes, as a thing common to men before. "Shall
   not the Judge of all the world do right?" And see, what immediately
   precedes, "Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked? That be far
   from thee; Shall not the Judge of all the world do right?" Gen. xviii.
   23, 25. Supposing this as a great fundamental, a principle that did
   always shine with its own light, and that did evidence itself, that it
   must belong to the Judge of all the earth to do right: and so put a
   difference between the righteous and the wicked, that they are not to
   fare all alike. And again,

   8. The very nature of the law, that was original and natural to man, is
   itself a high evidence and instance of divine goodness. The law of
   nature, that law (I say) which was original and natural to man, and so
   inwrought into himself at first, that he was even constituted as a law
   to himself, because that that was enjoined in it summarily, did carry
   his own reason in it, had in itself, recommending evidence to that
   conscience wherewith he was created, that God did rule upon those terms
   that he was to rule himself upon; and so must judge him upon such
   terms, as upon which he must judge himself. For do but consider, how
   this law is afterwards sum med up, all in one word, love. This was the
   fulfilling of the law, the loving of God above all: the most equal
   thing in all the world, that the highest and best love should be placed
   upon the highest and best good. This was that which his law required,
   that we should love the Lord our God, with all our heart, and with all
   our soul, and with all our might. Our Saviour gives this, as the
   summary and principal part of the law that was natural and original to
   man: and then, the second part is like the former, loving our neighbour
   as ourselves. How greatly evidential was this divine goodness, that
   when he had made a creature capable of government by a law, he should
   give him such a law as this, and impress it upon his mind, so as it
   might be said, God was not more to govern him by it, than he was to
   govern himself: and so finally was to judge him, by it, as he must
   needs judge himself! "He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good; and what
   doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
   to walk humbly with thy God?" Micah vi. 8. Walk in that dutiful
   subjection to God, which must be the necessary and easy product of
   supreme and sovereign love to him: and then, carry it justly and
   mercifully towards men. And, certainly, that must needs be an instance
   and evidence of the greatest goodness in God, that should be the cause
   of the greatest good in man. Now, do but suppose the world conformed to
   this law of God, in these two most noble and constituent parts of it;
   that is, that all the inhabitants of this world did live in the
   continual love of God, adoring him most gratefully as the great Author
   of their being, and in a universal and mutual love to one another, each
   man seeking another's felicity as his own, and having no more design of
   hurt or mischief against another than he hath against his own life, his
   own heart; what a happy world were this! And that which tends to
   happiness, must be from goodness: nothing is plainer. Now, when so
   admirable a law as this, every part agreeing with the whole, no branch
   but what is naturally included in this summary, this compendium; I say,
   when such a law as this was given to men, it is most natural to add,
   that the same goodness that did enjoin upon man such a law, must also
   adjoin a penalty to it, a threatening or due punishment for the
   violation of it; otherwise, the divine government had been ludicrous,
   if there should have been such a law which is without annexing any
   penalty. And the better the law, and more unexceptionable, the more
   clearly righteous and equal is a very severe penalty to be annexed to
   it: and the annexing it thereunto, is not only what divine goodness
   must allow, and doth allow, but what it did require. This was a thing
   not only consistent with divine goodness, but the effect of it, that
   there should be such intermination added unto such a law. For, if the
   adding of that sanction to the law, was the aptest means to procure the
   continual obedience of it, and the Jaw itself had a tendency to the
   good of the community for whom it was made, then the very addition of
   the sanction or threatening to the precept of the law, must not only
   consist with the goodness of it, but proceed from it. Any prince that
   cloth really study the welfare of the governed community, must be
   understood to adjoin due and proper penalties to good laws, for the
   good of the people to be governed by them: that the awe of the adjoined
   threatening may procure obedience, and that obedience, felicity to them
   that are so governed; so as that such a law being once made, goodness
   did not only admit of it, but did require that there should be a
   penalty annexed to it, to enforce obedience. And again,

   9, It was never to be expected, that when God made such a creature, he
   should create him in that which was to be his final state. It could
   never be looked for from the divine goodness, that making such a
   creature as man, he should settle him in a final, good and happy estate
   the first day he made him. It can be no way inconsistent with the
   goodness of God, that having made such a creature as man, he should
   order him a state of trial, of probation, through which he was to pass
   into that state which was to be final, and perpetually felicitating.
   For a final state is a state of retribution, a state of reward. The
   Scripture so speaks of it, frequently, as you cannot but know. Now I
   beseech you, what was it to be the reward of? It must be the reward of
   a foregoing obedience. And therefore, it could never have been expected
   from the divine goodness, that when God first made man, he should have
   made it impossible for him ever to have offended: or when he made any
   intelligent creature that he should have made it so. Those two great
   orders of intelligent creatures, angels and men, it is plain enough God
   made neither of them incapable of offending. And it was not reasonable
   to expect that he should. But as to ourselves, (for we are more obliged
   to mind our own concernments,) this is the account we have given us,
   (Eccles. vii. 29.) "God made man upright; but he hath sought out many
   inventions." God made him upright, put him into a good state, if he
   would have liked it, but he must needs fall to his own inventions, to
   mend it, and try if he could not make to himself a better state than
   God had made for him. It was never to be expected from the divine
   goodness, that he should, by almighty, extra ordinary power, have
   prevented this. For the creature that was designed to be rewarded with
   eternal felicity, for a present temporal obedience, he must be left to
   the trial of his ingenuity and dutifulness towards his bountiful
   Creator. Otherwise, there would have been no place, no room for reward.
   And if there had been no place for punishment, in case of disobedience,
   there could have been no place of reward, in case of obedience and
   duty. Therefore, I add hereupon,

   10. That inasmuch as it was necessary there should be such a law, and
   the threatening annexed to it, or punishment proportionable to any
   offence committed against it, the execution, according to the tenour of
   the threatening, became accordingly and consequently necessary,
   supposing once the violation of such a law. I speak of that law which
   was natural and original to man; for that little instance of obedience
   wherein God did put man at first upon, there could not have been
   transgression in that, without it had been a violating of the most
   natural law, in the most noble and essential part of it. Now, if a
   threatening were necessary to be annexed to a law, the execution of it,
   in case of a violation of that law, was consequently necessary; yea,
   and if the threatening did immediately proceed from divine goodness,
   the execution of the threatening must immediately proceed from it; but
   not without the intervention of the divine veracity. The goodness of
   God did lead him to add a due and proportionable threatening to his
   law: and this law being violated and broken, so as that the threatened
   punishment became due, it must be executed. That which was ordained
   from the divine goodness, it comes to be the immediate effects of
   divine justice, which is not contrary to goodness: it is only in our
   conception diverse, but far from being contrary. If there had not been
   such a constitution, the divine goodness had not shone forth with that
   lustre and evidence that now it doth. And there being such a
   constitution, his truth and legal justice oblige him, in some way or
   other, to keep to it, either in kind or equivalency: he must do himself
   and his own law that right, as to preserve the honour, reputation and
   dignity of it, and of his own government concerned therein. Therefore,
   the execution of such a law, by inflicting the incurred penalty one way
   or other was necessarily and unavoidably consequent: so necessary, that
   one attribute could not in this case have had its sole exercise without
   injury to some other, which our first consideration was directed
   against. But then I yet further add,

   11. That whatsoever penalty comes to be inflicted upon unreconcileable
   sinners, in the final and eternal estate, it must be acknowledged that
   much of divine goodness was exercised and demonstrated towards them
   before. Suppose an offending creature whose heart was implacable
   towards God, and so violently addicted to sensual lusts, that he had
   the authority of his Maker in continual contempt; and his whole life
   was a defiance to the authority of his justice and government, and the
   goodness and kindness of the offers he hath made to him; suppose (I
   say) such a creature incurs never so severe a penalty, he cannot but
   acknowledge that much of the divine goodness had its exercise and
   demonstration towards him before. For otherwise, what room or place
   were there for that expostulation of the apostle, even with them whom
   he supposeth finally to fall under wrath in the day of God's wrath, and
   revelation of his righteous judgment; "Despisest thou the riches of his
   goodness, and long-suffering, and forbearance? not knowing that the
   goodness of God should lead thee to repentance?" Despisest thou his
   goodness! This same despising had no object, if there had been no
   exercise of goodness towards such a one before: and it would suppose
   this expostulation to be a great impertinency. Despise goodness; it
   were to despise nothing, if there had been no goodness, and so there
   could have been no such thing as despising: the thing the apostle
   chargeth upon such a one; for there can be no act where there is no
   object. There could he no goodness to be despised, if there had not
   been the exercise of goodness towards such a one in a former state.
   Therefore, I add,

   12. That the general and special goodness of God are things no way
   inconsistent with one another. These two things do very fairly accord,
   God's general goodness towards all, and his special goodness towards
   some. And it argues a very great debility of mind, and shortness of
   discourse, when any do set these against one another, as if special
   goodness must destroy the notion of general goodness, or as if general
   goodness must destroy the notion of special. The matter would be more
   easily apprehensible, if we would bring it to a case relating to a
   human government, and suppose the best that is supposable in this
   world. Would you suppose that the clemency, kindness and goodness of
   the best prince that ever was (or of whom you can form any idea in your
   own minds) must oblige him to deal alike with all his subjects, that
   is, that all persons that are of equal parts, of equal understandings,
   must be equally prefer red, equally dignified? Would the goodness of
   any prince oblige him to this, that if he find a necessity to have some
   persons of good parts and understanding to be of a privy council to
   him, that he must have all to be of that privy council that are of as
   good parts as they? And shall such a prince not be thought to be good,
   or his government not to be equal, unless it were so? The best idea
   that we can form of any government is, that things be equally carried
   towards all, and yet special favour be towards objects that are not
   altogether incompetent, at the choice of the ruler. This is the best
   idea we can form. Bring then the matter to the divine government; we
   must distinguish between matters of right and matters of favour. For
   matters of right, we are to expect from it, that God do right to all
   men universally without exception; but for matters of mere favour, in
   reference whereunto he is not so much as a debtor by promise; (and he
   can be a debtor to none by nature) he can owe nothing to his creature.
   It is possible for a subject in a human government to oblige his ruler,
   but no creature can oblige God. A subject in a human government may
   really deserve favour and kindness at the hands of his rulers, for he
   can benefit them, it is in his power to profit them, they can really be
   the better for him; but God can be the better for none of us;
   therefore, he can be a debtor to none but by promise; we are therefore
   only to expect from the divine goodness, that where he hath promised,
   there he will be as good as his word; but for unpromised favour, to
   which the creature can have no title, that there he do dispense
   arbitrarily as seemeth good to him. And therefore, upon this ground his
   general goodness towards all, and special goodness towards some, are no
   inconsistencies one with another. And if he do generally shew that
   goodness in the course of his dispensations, to all his creatures, and
   especially to all the children of men, that every one that considers
   must acknowledge, then it is no detraction from the goodness that he
   doth shew to all, that he doth somewhat more of mere special favour for
   others, yea, though it be never so much, or though it be never so
   greatly more. There is no cause or pretence why any man's eye should be
   evil because his is good. For free and unpromised favours, (and all are
   unmerited, but such as are not only unmerited but unpromised too,) that
   he dispense out these arbitrarily, is certainly no repugnancy to the
   highest and most perfect goodness. I further add,

   13. That instances of the general goodness of God towards men are most
   numerous and undeniable. For besides, that he hath given them being,
   (when it was in his choice and pleasure whether he would or no,) here
   he entertains them in a world, to the making whereof, none of them did
   ever contribute any thing; he watches over them by an indulgent
   providence, supplies them with breath every moment; keeps off, for an
   appointed time, destructive evils, affords them out of that common
   bounty of his, the good things that are necessary for the continuance
   and comfort of life. How rich is this earth in its productions for
   offending creatures! I cannot but think of it, many times, with wonder,
   that considering that this inferior part of God's creation so soon
   after it was made, fell under his just displeasure and righteous curse,
   there yet should be so great variety of productions, every where in
   this earth, for the entertainment of rebels, or those that for the most
   part never give thanks for what they enjoy, never look up, although
   they have a capacity and disposition in their nature (originally) so to
   do, to adore, to pay reverence to the first and eternal Being. That
   which some think to be more the difference of a man from a brute than
   reason is, a natural religion, which some take a great deal of pains
   with themselves to erase and tear by the roots out of their own souls.
   Let us consider that which the text refers to, "Love your enemies,
   bless them that curse you, do good to them that despitefully use you,
   and persecute you, that you may be the children of your Father, who
   doth good to the evil and the good, makes his sun to shine and his rain
   to fall on one and the other;" do so, that you may represent your
   Father; herein lies his perfection. This whole earth that men fill with
   their wickedness, he fills with his goodness, "The whole earth is full
   of the goodness of the Lord," Psalm xxxiii. 5. "The Lord is good to
   all; and his tender mercies are over all his works." Psalm cxlv. 9. "He
   hath not left himself without witness, in that he doeth good, and gives
   fruitful seasons, and, fills men's hearts with food and gladness." Acts
   xiv. 17. And I further add,

   14. That even those instances of divine goodness that are of an
   inferior kind, have a tendency and aptitude in them to make way for the
   exercise of his goodness to them, in a higher and nobler kind. The
   goodness which God exerciseth towards men in the concernments of this
   natural life of theirs, they have a tendency and aptitude to affect
   their minds, and to be get good impressions there, and to make them
   consider and bethink themselves, "Whence is all this? and how comes it
   to pass that such provision should be made for one, and for creatures
   generally, of that order to which I belong?" This is the tendency, even
   of external mercies. Whereupon, it is spoken of with such resentment,
   "They say unto God, Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy
   ways--yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of
   the wicked be far from me," Job xxi. 14, 15. And the same, you have
   resumed afterwards, in the next chapter, implying that the tendency of
   things did run quite otherwise; that is, to allure and draw the minds
   and hearts of men towards God; and make them consider and bethink
   themselves, and say, Why should we not covet to know our great
   Benefactor, and him from whom all our good comes? But they say unto him
   "Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways:"--"though he
   filled their houses with good things;" and therefore, is there such a
   resentment afterwards expressed: "but the counsel of the wicked be far
   from me;" representing them as a monstrous sort of creatures, a sort of
   prodigies in the world, that there should be such a disaffection in
   rebellious and obdurate hearts against the Author of all goodness and
   kindness and mercy, that is in so continued a course exercised towards
   them. The counsel of the wicked be far from me; as if any serious and
   considering man must, and ought to be startled and affrighted at
   beholding such a spectacle as this, a reasonable, intelligent soul
   shunning and fleeing away from him who is daily loading it with his
   benefits, and seeking, by kindness and goodness, to insinuate himself
   into it, and so make room and place for himself, in the love and
   kindness of such a one. But that these Dispensations have this tendency
   in them, the Scripture is full of it; "Knowest thou not that the
   goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?" hath a leadingness
   thereto, in that mentioned Rom. ii. 4. "And count, (saith the apostle
   Peter in his 2 Epis. ch iii. 15.) that the long suffering of the Lord
   is salvation:" (he would not have us make a false count, I hope:)
   reckon that he is aiming at the saving of your souls, while he is doing
   good to you in external respects. If lie feed you with bread, if he
   feed you with breath day by day, and moment by moment, what is it for?
   Is it only to support such a despicable thing as this frail body of
   yours is, which must shortly be come a carcass? Is that the utmost of
   his design? No, he is leading thee to repentance, and would have thee
   account that both his bounty and his patience towards thee have
   salvation in design. Count the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation,
   that is, it is the design of the thing; it is that which the thing
   itself doth naturally aim at, and lead unto. And hereupon, we are told,
   in that. Acts xiv. 16, 17, l8. that God aimed at the turning men from
   the vanities that their hearts did doat on as the objects of their
   worship, to the living God; he did aim at this in giving them fruitful
   seasons, as you may see, if you take notice of the connexion between
   the 15 and 17 verses of that chapter. So, Acts 17, he gives them being,
   breath and all things, that they might seek after him who is not far
   from every one of us; in whom we live and move and have our being, And
   then,

   15. Lastly; The terms upon which he offers peace and pardon and eternal
   life to offending creatures are the highest proofs and evidences
   imaginable, of the wonderful goodness of God, notwithstanding that so
   great multitudes do, finally, refuse them and perish. And to this
   purpose, it should be considered, that the apostle speaks of this as
   matter of transport more than doubt, and that it did need more to be
   admired than evinced. "God so loved the world that he gave his only be
   gotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish but have
   everlasting life." John iii. 16. The silence that is there used is more
   speaking than any speech could be. He so loved the world, at so
   stupendous a rate. It is a very speaking silence that he doth not tell
   us how great that love is; he leaves us to understand it to be
   altogether inexpressible, that he should give his only Son. that
   whosoever believeth in him, should not perish--and whereas, men have an
   impotency to the exercise of that faith that is requisite to their
   attaining salvation, what is that impotency? It stands only in an
   affected blindness and obduracy of will; that which they call moral
   impotency. Now moral impotency doth not excuse, but aggravate the
   faultiness. No man takes moral impotency to be an excuse, but a high
   aggravation. As if a man is guilty of murder, and he bring this to
   excuse him,--"I could not but kill that man because I hated him, I did
   so violently hate him that I could not but do this unto him." That
   moral impotency (his extreme hatred) aggravates the crime, that that
   made it to be done, made it so highly faulty, and so much the more
   heinous, that it is done. He is not less guilty, but the more, by how
   much the more his hatred was predominant and prevalent in the case.
   Why, so this disaffection to God and to Christ and to holiness, (which
   is impotency) is an impotency seated in the will, and the ignorance
   hath its root, it ariseth and proceeds from thence, that is, that men
   are "alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in
   them, and because of the blindness of their hearts." A blindness which
   they love, a blindness which they choose, as it is, Ephes. iv. 18.
   Whereupon, all their misery is self-created. The miseries wherein men
   are involved in this world, which make it another hell to them, (a hell
   on this side hell,) and the miseries of the final and eternal state,
   they are all self-created: that is, they do arise from a fixed,
   inveterate malignity against the Author of their being, and that very
   nature itself, whereof their own, at first, was an imitation. An
   amazing thing, but it were impossible, if men did love God, to be
   miserable. Loving him is enjoying him, and enjoying him is felicity, if
   any thing be, or can be. The image of men's future miseries, you have
   in their present state. What is it that makes the world such a hell as
   it is, but men's hatred of God and of one another? For (as was said) if
   there were no contention at all, among men on earth, but who should
   love God best, and one another best, and who should do most for him,
   and for one another, what a heavenly life should we live here, a heaven
   on this side heaven: but the hell on this side hell, is only this, that
   men's hearts are filled with enmity against God, and one another: and
   from this malignity proceeds their infidelity, that they do not unite
   to God in Christ when they are called to it; which is no excuse, but an
   aggravation. But, in the mean time, that is the most wonderful goodness
   that can be thought, that such overtures should be made to men, God
   having given his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life.

LECTURE XXV. [14]

   And this may suffice to be said, in answer to that first objection
   against the divine goodness, the eternal miseries of the most. And,
   indeed, the sum of all that can be said upon that account, doth amount
   to this, as if it were a thing inconsistent with the goodness of God,
   that he hath made such a creature as man, given him so excellent a
   being, made him after his own image, that is, endowed him with a reason
   and a will, in his very creation: and, that having made him such, he
   did not unalterably fix him in a good and happy state the first day,
   but that he thought fit to pass him through a state of probation into
   his final state; and upon this lapse and degeneracy, he did not do for
   every one in order to their recovery as he hath done for some. In
   answer whereto, you have these considerations laid before you.

   But we pass on to the other objection; the temporal afflictions of good
   men. Some may be prone to impeach the divine goodness upon this
   account, and object against what hath been said on that subject. But
   here, such as find themselves disposed so to object, should reflect
   upon themselves and consider, what they themselves are. Are they good
   men that do thus object? Or are they such as are afraid to be so on
   this account, and are thereupon so very officious as to object this on
   the behalf of others, while they themselves are loth there upon to
   become good, apprehending they shall not serve a good master, and are
   therefore willing to wave and decline his service? If they be men of
   this latter stamp and character, that do so object, it seems that their
   sense must be this, that they will never be good themselves, unless God
   will hire them to it by temporal rewards and emoluments, by indulging
   them to live a life of case and pleasure and opulency in the world. And
   for them whose sense this is, I have but these things briefly to say to
   them:

   1. That true goodness can never be so mercenary. They are never like to
   become good upon these terms; if God should give them their own terms.

   2. I would have them consider what other choice they can have. If they
   will not serve God, and devote themselves to him, and admit to be such
   as he requires, (that is, truly good,) but upon these terms, what else
   will they do? What other master, or service, or way have they to make
   choice of? Can they, by their not being willingly subject to the
   governing power of God, exempt themselves from an unwilling subjection
   to his vindictive power? Whither will they betake themselves? will they
   leave God's dominions? will they go beyond the bounds of his
   territories? whither will they fly? Neither earth, nor heaven, nor
   hell, can keep them out of his reach; as the Psalmist, at large, speaks
   it in that 139 psalm, and the prophet Jeremiah in the 23 chap. of his
   prophecy. "Am I a God at hand, and not a God afar off? Do not I fill
   heaven and earth? saith the Lord." Is it to be a disputed thing between
   him and you, whether you shall serve him and comply with his good and
   acceptable will? And,

   3. If God should give such men their terms, whereas they appear to be
   in the temper of their spirits bad enough already, they have a great
   deal of reason to think that would make them a great deal worse. It
   needs abundance of previous and preventing grace not to be the worse
   for a good condition, here in this world, as all experience shews. And,

   4. Lastly, I would appeal to such, whether God is not, in such
   respects, abundantly good to them already. Hath he not given you breath
   and being and all things that you enjoy? How great are the favours that
   you partake of, in common with the rest of men! To instance in what the
   context mentions: "He makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the
   good, and sends his rain on the just and on the unjust." What a case
   were you in, if God should put out the sun, and if he should turn the
   fruitful land in which you dwell, into universal barrenness, by
   continual withholding his rain? If he should turn your present health
   into continual sickly languishings, and your ease into tormenting
   pains, and your plenty into pinching wants, and straits? And more than
   all this, if he should turn his invitations to you to pray and
   supplicate for higher, and those that may tend to eternal mercies, into
   prohibitions; and say to you, "Never pray, never supplicate, never look
   up, I will receive no addresses from you?" If his invitations to you to
   surrender yourselves, and become his, and take him for yours, should be
   turned into protestations against it, "I will never be your God, and
   you shall never be my people?" Think while this is not the case, if God
   be not abundantly good to you already, so that upon your own account
   you have very little reason to contest the matter with him.

   But, if good men do object this, as possibly against their more
   habitual frame, under the power of some temptation they may be apt to
   do, as we find it was with the Psalmist in the 73 psalm: and the like
   offence and scandal, good men are represented as, sometimes, apt to
   take at their own afflicted condition, compared with the prosperous
   state of worse men, against which, much of that 37th psalm is directed,
   and that 2lst of Job; and the beginning of the 12th. chap. of
   Jeremiah's prophecy: let such but go into the sanctuary, as the
   Psalmist did, (in that 73d. psalm) retire themselves, consider the
   thing in the secret divine presence, and commune with God about the
   matter, and not with their own souls, nor consult with flesh and blood,
   and let them but consider such things as these, briefly,

   (1.) Whether this matter of fact be ordinarily and generally true, that
   the case of good men is worse than that of wicked men in external
   respects. It is a matter that deserves to be considered and inquired
   wisely about; and certainly, upon inquiry, it will rather be found
   otherwise: that is, except in the paroxysm of persecution against
   instituted religion; (for it is very rare that men should be persecuted
   for natural but,) "if any man will live godly in Christ Jesus," he must
   expect to "suffer persecution." I say, except in some such paroxysm of
   persecution upon such an account, for Christianity itself, as to those
   that live among pagans, or for ibis or that institution of them that
   live among Christians, that case being excepted which is not constant;
   ordinarily, it appears evident that the better men are, the better
   their state and condition are in this world. Their religion obligeth
   them to that temperance, sobriety and diligence in their callings,
   prudent and discreet management of their affairs, that in ordinary
   cases it is most plain and manifest, that there are much fewer who are
   ruined by their religion, than that are ruined by their wickedness, by
   their riot, and by their debauchery; more persons, more estates, and
   more families are ruined that way, if there be but a survey taken of
   the state of things in this world: and the apostle offers this very
   consideration, (in that 1 Cor. x. 13. even to the very suffering
   christians of that time) "There hath no temptation," (that is tentative
   affliction) "befallen you but what is common to men," but what is
   human. It is true, the account is not common, but the matter of the
   affliction or the afflictions materially considered, are common to men.
   Are good men thrown into jails, and sometimes put to death for their
   religion? Truly, so are bad men for their wickedness, as frequently,
   and, if we should make a general computation, much more frequently.
   They suffer the same things very commonly, upon a less comfortable
   account. And,

   (2.) Where this is really the very case, that the condition of good and
   holy men is, in this world, much worse than that of the worst men, as
   many times it is so; they are to consider the vastly different value of
   spiritual and temporal good things, and this is the great business of a
   christian, to labour to have that spiritual sense in exercise, by which
   to be able to discern between good and evil, and to prefer the things
   that are more excellent: as those two scriptures compared together
   speak; Heb. v. 14. and Phil. iii. 8. They ought to have their naked,
   unvitiated senses by which to discern between good and evil, and to
   abound in that judgment and sense, in all sense, by which they may
   distinguish the things that differ, and prefer (as that expression
   admits to be read) the things that are more excel lent. And then, how
   much greater is the value of a sound and well tempered mind and spirit,
   above that of all earthly and worldly accommodations and enjoyments
   imaginable, which are but the gratifications of our flesh and external
   sense, at best. And,

   (3.) Such are to consider what is the experience of Christians of all
   times, concerning the aptitude and useful subserviency of external
   afflictions to inward and spiritual advantage: they say, when they are
   in their calmer, and more considering frames that it is good for them,
   that they were afflicted, and, that God hath done it in very
   faithfulness to them. And,

   (4.) Lastly. It is God's own declared end, in the temporal afflictions,
   he lets befal his, and therefore, would have them count it all joy,
   when they fall into divers temptations, that is, tentative afflictions.
   James i. 2. Count it all joy, because it made greatly for their
   perfection. The trial of your faith worketh patience, therefore, count
   it all joy; implying, there is more of real good in that one single
   excellency of patience, than can be of evil in all the external
   afflictions, absolutely resigned and submitted to the divine pleasure.
   Here is so much of an in choate heaven, such a heaven as our present
   state admits of, this one thing hath, as is riot only enough to make us
   patient, but joyful under the various temptations and trials of this
   kind, that we are apt to fall into, or lie under. And hereupon, where
   this sense hath been impressed upon the hearts of good men, they have
   thought the sufferings of the present time, were not worthy to be
   compared with the end of them, which was to be wrought out thereby, as
   in that, Rom. viii. 18. "I reckon that the sufferings of the present
   time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
   revealed in us." This is my arithmetic, so I account, or this is my
   logic, so I reason s the word may be rendered either way, this is the
   rational estimate I make of this case, having turned it round, and
   viewed it on every side, and balanced things with things, that the
   sufferings of the present time, this now of time, this very point of
   time, are not worthy to be compared (alas, it is not to be named the
   same day,) to the glory that is to be revealed. It is as nothing in the
   account, as if we should weigh a feather against a mountain. This is my
   rational estimate and judgment in this case. And, that God doth design
   the afflictions of this present state, as a preparation for the future,
   and eternal state, we have most expressly laid down in that, 2 Cor. iv.
   17. "The light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." It is a metathesis
   which is not usual in Scripture; do work for us, that is, indeed, do
   work us for it. And it is to be under stood, principally, of subjective
   glory, not objective; for that can never be more or less to any: it is
   essentially the same in itself with divine glory, but subjective glory,
   not objective, It is essentially the same in itself with divine glory;
   but subjective glory to be impressed, that is, more or less, according
   to the capacity and disposition of the subject. And we grow more
   capable, and are larger vessels, receptive of greater glory, as our
   temper is: and our temper is better, and made more receptive of larger
   and more glorious communications, even by the sufferings of this
   present time. By the light afflictions which are but for a moment, we
   are so much the more apt for the eternal weight of glory, which is to
   ensue; which we are not barely to be told, but to bear, answerable to
   the notion of weight. We are not only to be mere spectators of the
   glory there spoken of, but the subjects of it. And then, if this be all
   that God doth design by the afflictions that he lets befal good men
   here in this world, to refine them, to make them more partakers of his
   own holiness, and consequently of fuller glory, greater and higher
   measures of glory, is this any ground of taking up diminishing thoughts
   concerning his goodness? Yea, I might add,

   It is that which his very relation doth oblige him to, even as he is
   our Father: your heavenly Father is perfect. For what a Father is he to
   us? Or in what sense is he Father to his own? He is the Father of their
   spirits; so his word speaks contradistinguishly of him, to the fathers
   of our flesh. Of the flesh we have other fathers. Heb. xii. 9. He is
   not the Father of our flesh; he is the Creator 6f it: but of our
   spirits he is the Father. He is the Father of them, both upon a natural
   and supernatural account, as they have his natural image, being
   intelligent and spiritual beings like his own: and, as his regenerate
   children, have his holy image renewed in them. Now the very relation
   doth oblige him (if he be a Father to us, that is, to our spirits,)
   more principally to mind the advantage of our spirits. That very
   relation doth not only admit, but require that he should let us suffer
   in our flesh, if it may be for the advantage of our spirits: and that
   this outward man should be beaten and shattered day by day, even unto
   perishing, if, while this is a doing and suffering, the inward man may
   be renewed day by day. He must take the principal care about that to
   which he is a Father. Affection must follow the relation; the relation
   is to our spirits, and the affection must be, principally, to our
   spirits.

   But I shall insist no further on that part. It remains only to make
   somewhat of Use of what hath been said, especially touching this divine
   perfection of the goodness of God. And,

   1. Be hereupon encouraged to cherish this apprehension concerning God,
   take heed that nothing ever shake your fixed belief and apprehension of
   this. And whatsoever reasonings do arise in your minds at any time,
   forelay this always, let it be always a thing forelaid in you. Yet God
   is good to Israel, as the Psalmist begins that 73 psalm. Nothing can be
   of greater importance, either to the liveliness and vigour, or even to
   the very substance and being of religion, than a fixed, stable
   apprehension of the divine goodness: that religion is nothing, the soul
   whereof is not love. If love be not the very soul of your religion,
   your religion is a carcass, an empty nothing. But that love may be the
   soul of it, there must be a constant apprehension of the loveliness of
   the object. Labour then to have your souls possessed always with a deep
   and fixed apprehension of the divine goodness. Contemplate it in every
   thing that you behold, in every thing that you enjoy, yea, even in the
   lessening and qualifying of those evils that you suffer. Go up and down
   this world with hearts full of this thought; "the whole earth is full
   of his goodness." Collect all the instances you can of the goodness of
   God, and keep by that means, such an apprehension alive and in vigour
   concerning him. What a mighty spring would this be, of cheerful and
   joyful and pleasant religion. Let no thought arise, but let it meet
   with a seasonable check, if it tend to any diminution of divine
   goodness. And,

   2. Preserve a worshipping, adoring frame of spirit Godward upon this
   very account, having your hearts full of this apprehension and sense;
   labour always to be in a posture of adoration, apt and ready always to
   look up, carrying that as a motto engraven on your hearts, "I am less
   than the least of all thy mercies." And again,

   3. Endeavour as much as in you is, accordingly to look upon that
   immediate promanation of the divine goodness, his law; that which
   issues, which' proceeds so directly from the goodness of God. Esteem it
   to be what really it is, the product and image of the divine goodness.
   Look upon him as absolutely, universally perfect, and consider the
   reasonableness of what is said concerning this law, in correspondency
   thereunto. "The law of the Lord is perfect." Psalm xix. 7. And
   considering this one single perfection of the Divine Being, his
   goodness, make a proportionable judgment concerning his law, in
   reference to that; that is, that it is an expression of his good and
   acceptable will: and labour, more and more, to prove that by a vital
   sense, by an experimental relish in your own spirits. O! how good is it
   to be what he would have me to be! what that most perfect rule of his
   doth require and oblige me to be. And,

   4. Accordingly judge concerning the course of his providential
   dispensations. His law prescribes to us the way in which we are to
   walk; his providences make the way in which he walks; labour to
   apprehend goodness therein too. All his ways are mercy and truth. That
   is, you are to judge according to the series of his providences
   complexly taken, and as together they do make up one entire frame. And
   so, indeed, we are to make up our judgment concerning his law. Not by
   this or that particular precept, for it would be a very hard imposition
   upon the mind of a man, to judge and pronounce concerning the goodness
   of that command to pluck out the right eye, or cut off the right hand,
   or the right foot, abstractly taken, without reference to the conjunct
   precepts, and without reference to the end, to which, altogether, they
   refer. And so, if you look upon providence, you are not to pronounce
   concerning this or that, separately and apart, considered by itself. As
   you would not make a judgment of the goodness of a piece of arras by
   looking on it folded up, where you can only discern a piece of a leg,
   or a piece of an arm, it may be, or the limb of a tree, but look upon
   it unfolded, and there see the entire frame of it all at once. So
   consider the providences of God, in reference one to another, and in
   reference to their end in which all things shall finally issue, and
   into which they shall result, and you must say as the Psalmist doth,
   "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth. "Ancl as Moses, in that
   triumphant song of his, in the 32 Deut. where he tells us, in the
   beginning, his design was to publish the name of the Lord, that is, to
   represent the glory of his attributes; "Because (saith he) I will
   publish the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness to our God: He is
   the rock, his work is perfect." Take all together, you will see it will
   be perfect work at length, entire, all of a piece; and that nothing
   could have been spared out of that series and chain of providence that
   compose and make up the whole course. And then,

   5. Endeavour that your knowledge of God may be practical, vital,
   unitive and transforming, as touching this very thing, the divine
   goodness. O! how much to be lamented is it, that we should have such a
   notion of God in our minds to no purpose? the notion of so great a
   thing, a Being absolutely perfect and infinite, even in this
   perfection, goodness itself, immense goodness lying in our minds, idle,
   dead, useless and in vain; so that our hearts are in reference hereunto
   but a mere rasa tabula. There is a notion in our minds, but nothing
   correspondent impressed upon our hearts, such an apprehension of God as
   this, if it were vital, lively and operative, would transform us, make
   us aim continually to be such as he is, which I shall further press by
   and by. It would powerfully attract and draw us into union with him.
   What! shall I live at a distance from the Fountain of all goodness,
   immense goodness, goodness itself, love itself! God is love. He that
   believes the love of God, is hereupon drawn to dwell in God as he is
   love, considered under that notion, and so to have God to dwell in him;
   as the apostle expresseth it, 1 John iv. 16. What mighty influence
   would this have upon our whole course, if we did go with lively;
   operative, apprehensions up and down the world of the divine goodness!
   How should we disburden our souls of care! With what cheerfulness
   should we serve him! How little doubt should we have concerning the
   issue of things! of that glorious reward which a course of obedience,
   service, and fidelity to him, a little will be followed with at last.
   But that our knowledge of God, as to so great a thing as this, should
   be like no knowledge, as if we knew nothing, or as if we thought the
   quite contrary concerning him; methinks, this we should look upon as an
   insufferable thing, as a thing not to be endured, and so take up
   resolutions, dependant upon his grace, never to be at rest till our
   hearts were like this apprehension of God, that he is perfect in
   goodness. And hereupon further,

   6. Make sure of your relation to him as your God, as your Father; and
   consider and contemplate his goodness with that very design, that you
   may be indeed stirred up to aim at coming, without more ado, into that
   relation. We do not much concern ourselves so seriously to inquire
   touching the character of a person with whom we are never to have to
   do, with whom we have no concern nor ever expect to have any. If we
   hear of any such as an excellent person, we hear such a thing of him
   with more indifferency of mind, "I do not know him, and I am like never
   to know him; and be as good and as excel lent as he will, I am never
   like to be the better for him." But when I receive an account of one,
   as a most excellent person, who designs to adopt me at the same time
   for his son, and overtures are made to me for that purpose, I think
   myself highly concerned to inquire into the character of a person to
   whom I am to be related. And so should we consider the characters that
   we meet with of God; for we must either have him as our Father, or we
   must be children of a worse father, or of the worst of fathers.
   Therefore, this should be hearkened unto, your heavenly Father is
   perfect, perfectly good, perfect in goodness, upon this account, that
   overtures are made to me in order to my becoming one of his children: I
   am to come into his family; this is the thing that is proposed to me.
   And should not I labour to know what a one he is, and to contemplate
   the representation that is made to me of him, upon this account? And,

   7. Consider with highest admiration and gratitude, the greatness, the
   privilege, that you are, or maybe so related. As the case is stated, if
   this be not, there is nothing wanting but your own willing and joyous
   acceptance of the overture, falling in with it, resigning and giving up
   yourselves most absolutely and entirely to him; and taking his Christ
   for yours; with him goes the sonship, that is, with the acceptance of
   his own eternal Son. John i. 12. "To as many as received him, to them
   gave he power to become the sons of God, even to as many as believed in
   his name." And then, consider the greatness of the privilege, that you
   are, or may be thus related to the Most High God as a Father, to the
   best, most perfect, and most excellent of beings. You may have him for
   your Father, and perhaps you have him so already. How great a privilege
   is this! To have him for your Father is to have all. He that
   overcometh, shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he
   shall be my son. Rev. xxi. 7. "And if children, then heirs, heirs of
   God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ." God is to be your portion and
   inheritance, that if we suffer together with him (which is but a
   trifle, not to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed) we
   may be also glorified together. Rom. viii. 17, 18. Methinks, this
   should run in our minds every day; we are cither related to this
   blessed One, as our Father, or we may be; we are invited and called by
   the gospel, (and it is the great design of this gospel) into this
   blessed state. Methinks, it should run in our minds all the day long,
   that that glorious and most excellent One, should look down from heaven
   upon such an. abject worm as I, and say to me, "Call me Father, take me
   for thy Father." A heart that were full of the sense of this, would
   soon grow too big for all this world. What a trifle would this world be
   to that soul which were full of that sense; "God is become my Father, I
   have a Father in heaven, that doth whatsoever he will in heaven and in
   earth, and there is no withstanding him." He can do what he will, and
   he will do nothing but what is kind and good to them that willingly
   consent to come into this comfortable relation to him. You see how
   distinguishingly such a case is spoken of in the next chapter, Mat. vi.
   in the latter end. Do not you so and so, like the gentiles. Do not
   torture yourselves with cares and thoughts, "what ye shall eat, and
   what ye shall drink, and what you shall put on," and what shall become
   of your affairs and concerns in the world, and the like: the gentiles
   do so: after these things do the gentiles seek; but your heavenly
   Father knows what you. need; you have a Father in heaven that knows all
   your concernments, and that minds all of them, with all wisdom, and all
   the tenderness and kindness imaginable, I would not have you be as if
   you had no Father, to put yourselves into the same condition with
   pagans and outcasts, and those that are without God in the world. And
   then,

   8. Lastly; Imitate God in his imitable perfections, and especially in
   this his goodness. I say, imitate him with all the goodness that is
   possible, in all his perfections: "Be ye perfect, for your heavenly
   Father is perfect." So I would shut up, bringing the exhortation in the
   text, and inferring reason together. And pray drive it to this one
   particular thing, to which the context draws and claims it, that is,
   unto love: and even unto such love as shall reach enemies themselves.
   You very well know, that God could have shewn no love at all to any in
   all this world, but he must shew it to an enemy: all were in enmity and
   rebellion against him. "The carnal mind Js enmity against God." And
   this world was only possessed with such inhabitants, all sunk in
   carnality and earthliness, and deep oblivion of God, and full of anger
   and displeasure, upon being put in mind that there is One that claims a
   right over them, and that would have all their thoughts and their love:
   this they cannot endure; this carnalized race of creatures cannot bear
   this. "For the carnal mind is enmity against God." And he could never
   have been kind to men but he must be kind to enemies. For all were
   become his enemies, affected liberty, and could not endure the thought
   that there should be a power and a Lord to prescribe to them. I pray,
   let us labour to imitate this great perfection of the divine goodness,
   even in this very application of it to enemies. This is the beauty and
   the glory of the Christian religion, the thing wherein it excels the
   precepts of the most refined paganism, and of that which was higher,
   (as it was grown,) Judaism itself. "You have heard that it was said" of
   old time, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy:" (as it is
   in the context) "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that
   curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you;
   that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven." I
   never expect the Christian religion to flourish much in this world,
   till this appear and be exercised as the common temper of christians.
   They are to be such a sort of men, as that all the world may be the
   better for. If you express never so much of unkindness towards them, if
   you use them hardly, they will bless you, they will pray for you, they
   will do you all the good they can, all the good and kind offices in
   their power. When this spirit comes to be revived among men, it will
   make the Christian religion (as I may say) grassari, mightily to
   prevail and grow upon the world. The world must fall before such a sort
   of men as this. But that it will never do while, in this respect,
   christians are just like other men, as wrathful, as vindictive, as full
   of rage, and as full of revenge as any body else. Christian religion
   must grow upon the world, by things that will strike the sense, that
   incur the most sensible observation of men. Every one can tell and sees
   it when one is kind to them, and when they have good returned for evil.
   But there are two things most directly opposite to this temper, which
   christians are wont too frequently to overlook, never to animadvert
   upon: the one is,

   (1.) When they let their hearts tumultuate with too great fervour and
   anger against men, upon account of their profaneness and
   irreligiousness; and they think themselves warranted so to do: such a
   one is a wicked man, an open, visible enemy against God and Christ, a
   rebel against heaven. And so they allow themselves to let wrath have
   its vent and liberty towards such men, and upon such occasions. It was
   a great deal of zeal for Christ, that the disciples discovered, when
   they would have had fire to fall down from heaven to vindicate his
   cause upon those Samaritans that would not receive him into their town.
   But, saith Christ, "Ye know not what spirit ye are of." This is quite
   another thing from that spirit which I intend to introduce into the
   world, and which must breathe in, and animate, the religion that I am
   setting on foot among men. The other is,

   (2.) Their confining their kindness and respects to men of such and
   such a character, to this or that party. It is a temper more grossly
   remote, more vastly different from what is enjoined upon us here; and
   the thing that our Saviour animadverts upon in this context, as that
   wherein we do not only not exceed the pharisees as such, but even
   publicans themselves, ver. 20. We are told, that except our
   righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, we
   shall in no case enter into the kingdom of God: not even into the
   initial kingdom. As if he had said, "Ye are not fit for the Christian
   state, you do not come within the confines of Christianity, real
   Christianity, if your righteousness do not exceed the righteousness of
   the scribes and pharisees. But when men do confine their respects and
   the kindness of their hearts to a party, this is not only to outdo the
   pharisees, but even publicans and sinners, for they do so; if you love
   and salute them that love and salute you, if you are kind to them that
   are kind to you, what do you more than others? do not even the
   publicans and sinners the same? But "be ye perfect;"--(that is the
   contexture of this discourse) "even as your Father which is in heaven
   is perfect."

   And so I have done with what I designed upon this subject, of the
   divine perfections or attributes; the next we come in course to, will
   be that of the divine decrees and purposes of God: and more especially
   concerning men, and with reference to them.

LECTURE I. [15]

   Ephes. i. 11.

   In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
   according to the purpose of him who
   worketh all things after the counsel
   of his own will.

   HAVING discoursed to you, what I thought requisite, concerning the
   attributes and perfections of the Divine Being, we now come, according
   to the order of discourse, to speak to you of the Divine Decrees. I
   choose to call them by that name, because, by divines, they are usually
   so called; though according to the more ordinary use of that word in
   Scripture, it more frequently signifies public laws or edicts, whether
   human or divine, than private and secret purposes. And so in common
   speech too, and other writings, nothing is more usual than to call the
   constitutions of states and princes, decreta. But however, the word
   being so explained, to signify a secret purpose, antecedent to any
   manifestation, it may then fitly enough be so used; and in that sense,
   it is generally understood by divines, treating on the head of
   religion.

   And upon this subject, my design is not to speak to every thing that is
   disputed in the schools about it; but only what may be requisite, and
   sufficient unto the common faith and practice of Christians. Nor shall
   I need to lay down any other doctrine, than the very words of the text,
   that--God "worketh all things, according to the counsel of his own
   will,"--wherein you do see, there are several particulars to be
   considered. There is,

   1. The final term of all God's works, that wherein they do directly
   terminate, All things.

   2. There is his working itself, tending towards that term, he worketh
   all things.

   3. There is his purpose and volition of all that he worketh, called his
   will. And

   4. There is the supreme measure of all those volitions or acts of his
   will, and so of his subsequent actions, and that of his counsel. He
   worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will.

   I shall speak briefly to each of these, but most largely to that which
   is our most proper subject, with reference to the purpose for which we
   have chosen to insist upon these words, that is, the will of God; not
   merely the faculty, but the acts of his will. But we shall briefly go
   over the several particulars already mentioned.

   1. For the things wherein the acts willed by him, do finally terminate,
   which we are told are all things, and that universality may be
   understood two ways, either relatively, in reference to those works
   that do terminate in these things; as if he said, all things that he
   works, he works according to the counsel of his will. Or else, also, it
   may be understood absolutely and simply, there being simply nothing at
   all, unto which his agency, one way or other, extends not: though not
   to every thing in the same way; as there will be occasion to shew
   hereafter.

   2. For his working that terminates in these things, that is, in all
   things; it is emphatically expressed in the text; the word is
   energountos, in-acting, or in-working all things. It shews the peculiar
   kind of the divine agency, such as nothing can exclude, and nothing can
   disappoint. And then,

   3. There is his will itself, which must be looked upon as the immediate
   source of all these operations of his. And that we shall consider, not
   only as it is the measure of all his actings, but as it is
   self-measured by that counsel, that lies in his eternal and
   all-comprehending mind, which is the fourth particular in order, that
   we have briefly to consider. And touching that,

   4. We must know, that it cannot be understood in the same sense with
   God, and with men, as indeed nothing can that comes under the same name
   with him and with us; for nothing can be absolutely common between God
   and the creature; or have precisely the same common notion: there
   cannot but be infinite difference, always, between whatsoever is
   finite, and that which is infinite. Counsel with men imports
   imperfection; it signifies that we have not suddenly a perspection of
   the reason, and aptitudes of things, what it is fit for us to resolve,
   and not to resolve! and do, or not to do. And thereupon we deliberate,
   and arrive more slowly and by degrees from a more indistinct perception
   of the reason of things, to a clearer and more distinct perception of
   them, With God, it cannot be so, before whose all-seeing eye, all
   things lie in their aptitudes and correspondencies at one view; so as
   he doth not see things be cause they are connected with one another, so
   as to proceed from the knowledge of things that are more clear, to the
   knowledge of things that are more obscure; all things being equally
   clear and equally present, to his eye and to his view. But by way of
   analogy, that which is effected by counsel among men in the way of
   consultation, debate of things with themselves, continued discourse,
   reasonings and arguings of matters in their own minds to and fro, that,
   which with men hereupon is called judgment, counsel, hath the same name
   given it with him also. Not that it signifies the same, but that most
   perfect judgment of things, which is indeed the highest and most
   exquisite wisdom, which he hath eternally and all at once, when we do
   arrive to the like by steps. And so according to that perfect
   perception, that he hath of the reason of things, and their aptitudes
   and correspondencies to one another, and to his creatures, and to him,
   so accordingly he wills, and accordingly he doth.

   And this counsel of his, it may be taken two ways, either 1st. As it is
   internal, lying only in his own mind: or else 2nd. As it hath an after
   manifestation, as many of those things which lay from eternity, and
   through many successions of ages of time, secret in his own mind have,
   and do come to be revealed and made manifest more or less, and in such
   degrees as to him hath seemed fit. In that latter sense, counsel is
   taken frequently in Scripture, even when it is spoken of God, as these
   phrases do plainly signify, "If they had stood in my counsel. They
   despised all my counsel, and set at nought my reproofs. I have declared
   to you the whole counsel of God." Jer. xxiii. 22. Pro. i. 30. Acts xx.
   27.

   But here, it must be understood to signify counsel as it is secret, as
   lying in his own eternal mind, and as it is, thereupon, the measure of
   all the purposes of his will, and of all he subsequently doth, and hath
   done, in the creation and continual government of this world. In that
   latter sense, counsel is, even among men, correspondency in that
   acceptation of it with God, put for certain, established laws, and
   constitutions, and even as decrees are. Thus, with the Romans, many
   constitutions of theirs are known to go under the name of senatus
   consulta, that is, things consulted of, and agreed upon, by the
   governing power among them. But this is not the sense that it is to be
   taken in here, for notwithstanding much of the counsel of God be
   manifested, we are to consider it now as antecedent to any such
   manifestations: and thereupon, to return to that which is our more
   principal subject, his will, according to such counsel, "He works all
   things after the counsel of his own will;" according to that counsel
   which doth (as it were) guide and measure all the determinations and
   purposes of his just and holy will. We are not to understand, that the
   divine will here signifies the faculty of will, abstractly and
   precisely, but as comprehending the acts, the volitions, the
   determinations and purposes of the divine will, that which is commonly
   meant by the word decrees. And so, concerning the will of God and the
   purposes thereof, I shall first give you some distinctions, and then,
   secondly, lay down what I conceive necessary to be said concerning this
   subject in certain propositions.

   First. There are sundry distinctions of the divine will, which it may
   be fit to take some notice of: and some of them will be of great use to
   us.

   1. There are, who distinguish the will of God into antecedent and
   consequent. But I know no ground for that distinction, there being no
   first or last with him, or former or lat ter, as we shall have occasion
   further to shew.

   2. Again, some distinguish it into absolute and conditional; but
   certainly, it is over bold to feign any such distinction as that, of
   the divine will, properly so called; it is indeed agreed on all hands
   that there are conditions of the things willed, but there can be none
   of the will itself concerning those things; the faculty and act of the
   will not being distinguishable in God, as they are in us; for he is a
   pure act: and to suppose there can be a condition of the will itself in
   God, is to suppose a conditional Deity and so, consequently, a
   contingent one, and so, consequently, none at all.

   3. Again, some do more truly distinguish the divine will into that
   which is bene placite, and that which is signi. And for the former
   member of that distinction, it is most unexceptionable and scriptural:
   good pleasure, and the good pleasure of his will, we read of again and
   again in this very context, as well as many. times besides in
   Scripture. But for the other member of the description, it is too
   obscure for common use; and will require more explication than is
   proper for this place.

   4. It is again distinguishable into his objective and active will, or
   his will objectively taken and actively taken, so the thing willed is
   often called the will of God: as when we pray, "Thy will be done," that
   is, the thing that thou hast willed. And so that of the apostle, in the
   Acts, "The will of the Lord be done," and that of our Saviour, "he that
   doth the will of my Father," and the like. This is the will of God
   taken objectively, or for the thing willed. But then, it is taken also
   actively, as it signifies his volition itself, the purpose and
   determination, of his will; and so it must be taken here.

   5. It is again distinguishable into secret and revealed; a very useful
   and necessary distinction. His will, as it lies concealed within
   himself, and the same will, in many things made at length known and
   extant to the world, subjected to the common notice of men; that is, in
   such things as it concerns them to know and be acquainted with.

   6. Others distinguish it into decretive and legislative, which is a
   very proper distinction too, if we take decretive in the fore-explained
   sense; otherwise, it falls in with the legislative, and is the same
   thing.

   7. Others distinguish it into the will of purpose and the will of
   precept, which is a true distinction too. Only, that latter member is
   not extensive enough; for there are many things which, in the compass
   of God's revealed will, are necessary for us to know; and even within
   the compass of his legislative will, besides bare precept; but not in
   all respects. His will concerns what he will do himself, and it also
   concerns what he will have us to do. But it is his will concerning his
   own actions, concerning his own works, of which the text speaks: "He
   worketh all things," that is, his own works, "after the. counsel of his
   own will." And as it doth concern his own works, it may concern them
   diversely: that is, either such works of his as he designs to do
   immediately, and apart from us, or such works of his as have a
   reference to works of ours, wherein he is to work with us, or wherein
   he is to work, (as in some instances) after us; that is, in those great
   instances of rewarding and punishing. These works of his come after
   ours, though the will of them is eternal before. Again,

   8. His will is to be distinguished into effective and permissive: his
   will to effect whatsoever he thinks fit for him to effect; and his will
   to permit whatsoever he thinks fit to permit, or not to hinder, while
   what he so wills, or determines so to permit, he intends also to
   regulate, and not to behold as an idle unconcerned spectator, but to
   dispose all those permissa unto wise and great ends of his own.

   These useful distinctions (as there are divers of them) given, I shall
   now proceed,

   Secondly. To lay down, in divers propositions, what is requisite for us
   to understand and believe, concerning this matter, of God's purpose, by
   his counsel, in reference to the things which he works among his
   creatures, and some of these propositions will be more general, and
   fundamental unto some others, which shall be (God willing) more
   particular. But for the more general propositions you may take such as
   these:

   1. That all the purposes of the divine will are co-eternal. There can
   be no such thing as a new will in God; for there is nothing in God,
   that is not God; and nothing of God can begin de novo: for that were to
   suppose a new Deity. And here upon, there can be no place for dispute
   about the priority or posteriority of this or that purpose of God; they
   must be all simultaneous, all at once, in one and the same eternal
   view, according to that clear and distinct and all-comprehending
   prospect that he hath of all things, eternally before his eyes. And
   though it be true, indeed, that we are constrained to conceive of
   things; (because we cannot conceive them all at once as he doth,) by
   first and second, former and latter, and to consider of a natural
   priority and posteriority, where there is no such thing in real
   existence; I say, though we are constrained so to do, (which is a thing
   owing to the imperfection of our minds,) yet, we must take heed of
   building upon our own foundation, schemes and models of the divine
   decrees, as a great many have perplexed themselves in doing: and
   wherein we can determine nothing, but with the greatest uncertainty
   imaginable, nor, indeed, without too great presumption, bringing down
   the Deity to our human measures and models, and forms of conception.
   Again,

   2. We must take this proposition concerning the will and purposes of
   God, that they do always connect together means and ends: that is,
   supposing he hath willed and determined such an end, we must,
   accordingly, suppose he hath determined with himself the way or means,
   by which he will bring that end about; supposing it to be a thing to be
   done immediately: as those things are to be done, and in the same way
   wherein they are to be brought about, in the same way we must
   understand he hath determined to bring them about. As when he did in
   tend to preserve David at Keilah, he did also determine he should not
   stay there, knowing that if he did, the inhabitants would have given
   him up to Saul, as you may read it was determined, upon David's
   inquiry, 1 Sam. xxiii. So when he determined to save the life of Paul,
   and all his companions, and fellow passengers in the ship, where they
   were in so much jeopardy and danger, he did also determine that the
   mariners should not go away, for the apostle saith expressly, "If these
   go away we cannot he saved," after he had expressly, from God, told
   them, that not a hair of any of their heads should fall to the ground.
   And therefore, we are not to suppose that he doth determine an end to
   be brought about by means, but he doth also determine and ascertain the
   means by which it shall be brought about: so that if he intend any of
   us to live to such a term of time, he never intends that, and intends
   at the same time to let us, several years before, starve ourselves,
   poison or stab ourselves. But determining the end, he also determines
   those means by which he intends to bring about that end: he intends to
   bring it about in such a way: that is, in a mediate way.

   3. The purposes of God, and his foreknowledge are in some sort
   commensurate: taking foreknowledge in the proper sense, foreknowledge
   doth refer to futurity, as knowledge more abstractly taken, doth to all
   beings actual and possible; all possibilities come within the compass
   of divine knowledge: but of his foreknowledge, only futurities, or what
   shall be. And as to these, his purpose and foreknowledge are some way
   commensurate, that is, whatsoever he foreknows shall be, he either
   purposeth to effect, or he purposeth not to hinder it. And again,

   4. Whatsoever God doth actually bring to pass, that we may conclude he
   did purpose to bring to pass. Whatsoever he doth, he did purpose to do;
   for he doth nothing against his will, or without his will: and he can
   have no new will, as was told you before, and as it is plain in itself.
   Therefore, whatsoever he actually doth, he did always eternally purpose
   to do.

   5. Whatsoever he actually permits, he did never purpose to hinder.
   There must be a correspondency between his purpose as to permissa,
   things that are permitted by him, and the things permitted, as there is
   with reference to effecta; between his purpose, and the thing that he
   effects. Again further.

   6. Whatsoever God might, righteously and consistently with all the
   other attributes and perfections of his being, effect and do, or permit
   and surfer, that he might righteously resolve and purpose to do, and
   resolve and purpose to permit and not to hinder. Whatsoever it is that
   is consistent with his wisdom, holiness and goodness, actually to do,
   it is equally consistent with his wisdom, and with his righteousness,
   and with his goodness, to purpose to do, even from eternity. And
   whatsoever was consistent with his wisdom, and righteousness, and
   goodness to permit it and not to hinder, it is equally consistent with
   his wisdom, righteousness and goodness, to purpose not to hinder it;
   and so, to have a permissive decree concerning it, if he saw meet and
   fit to do it. And,

   7 Whatsoever, in respect to God's actions and purposes, would imply any
   thing of imperfection, we must sever and remove from him; whatsoever
   would imply perfection, we must assert and ascribe to him. Hereupon, if
   it would be a plain, manifest imperfection to act incogitantly,
   unadvisedly, or to do unintended things, as it were casually and at
   random, without a foregoing intention or purpose; if that, I say, would
   be an imperfection, we ought most carefully to sever it from God, and
   never think it possible for him to act so; that is, incogitantly,
   unadvisedly, without any foregoing intention or purpose; and if it be a
   perfection, to act according to wisdom, and counsel, and judgment, and
   steady purpose, we must by all means assert it concerning God, and
   ascribe it to him in reference to all his purposes and actions.

   These are general propositions that do lay some foundation for more
   particular ones, which are to follow. And herein, though it is very
   true, that God hath his purposes and decrees concerning all things: "He
   worketh all things according to the counsel of his own will." yet, we
   shall more especially consider his purposes concerning men. You know,
   that must be our business: and therein too, though he hath purposes and
   decrees concerning all the actions of men, whether personally
   considered, or considered as members of a community, lesser or larger,
   civil or ecclesiastical, concerning churches, concerning states and
   kingdoms, their successions, their rises, their continuance, their
   periods; though he have, I say, purposes concerning all these, and all
   within the compass of the text, "He worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will," yet, I shall chiefly keep my discourse to
   those purposes that concern our spiritual and eternal state. And so
   shall lay down briefly the other and particular propositions. As,

   1. That God did, undoubtedly, purpose to make such a world as this, for
   we find he hath made it; and he doth nothing that he did not purpose to
   do.

   2. He did purpose to make such a creature as man, and place him here;
   for we also find, so he hath done.

   3. He did purpose to create man in an innocent state, and
   proportionably good and happy unto the innocency and purity in which he
   did create him. For his word tells us, that he did create him so. He
   "made man upright." And it gives us an account of the circumstances of
   his condition when he made him, though briefly, yet as far as was
   necessary. And,

   4. He did not purpose to confirm him at first in that good state
   wherein he made him, so as to make it impossible for him to fall; for
   we find he did fall, and is in a lapsed state: therefore, it was
   purposed that his fall should not be prevented, that it should not be
   hindered: though none doubt, but that he that made man, could have made
   him as well impeccable, without any possibility of sinning, as he did
   make him sinless at present, without any thing of depravedness by sin.

   5. It is evident, God did not purpose to leave fallen man to perish
   universally in his apostate, fallen state: for we hear of, and know,
   the methods and appointed means for the recovery and salvation of
   fallen creatures, of fallen men, which are offered to our view in the
   word of God.

   6. He did decree or purpose to send his own Son to be a Redeemer and
   Saviour unto lost and perishing creatures, to be born, to live in this
   world, to die in pursuance of that reconciling design, and to overcome
   death; and in his resurrection and conquest over death, to erect a
   kingdom into which he would collect, as the voluntary subjects of it,
   all those that should resign and yield themselves to him, put
   themselves under his governing power, and submit themselves to his
   saving mercy, at once. And the substance of this we have given us as
   the matter of a divine decree, in that psalm ii. 7. "I will declare the
   decree. The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I
   begotten thee." Very true it is, that that is not directly meant of the
   nativity of our Lord: we find the apostle expounds it otherwise, Acts
   xiii. 33.) "We declare to you glad tidings, how that the promise which
   was made to our fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their
   children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written
   in the 2d psalm," (the most express quotation in the New Testament out
   of the Old) "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee: and as
   concerning that he raised him from the dead now no more to return to
   corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of
   David." It was in pursuance of a divine, eternal purpose and decree,
   that this was said, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:"
   that is, when he raised him from the dead, when he begot him again out
   of the grave, and by that glorious regeneration, he did then put upon
   him that high and excellent title (that was fundamental to the other
   glorious one that did ensue thereupon) "The first-begotten from the
   dead: the Prince of the kings of the earth." Rev. i. 5. But yet, though
   that be not the thing directly there spoken of, as the matter of the
   divine decree, God's first bringing him into this world, yet, that
   being the matter of a divine decree, (to wit) his dying, and his
   conquering death, and being begotten (as it were) a second time, or I
   may say a third time out of the grave, out of the womb, as his goings
   forth from eternity in respect of his Deity, and as he was, as man, at
   first brought out of the womb of the virgin, yet, even that earlier
   parturition must be supposed here, to have been the matter of a divine
   purpose and decree too. And so other scriptures do speak of the whole
   complex of this matter, as falling under a divine purpose. "That he
   verily was foreordained," (as Acts ii. 23.--1 Pet. i. 20. and onwards)
   foreordained to every thing he did, and foreordained to every thing he
   suffered, in pursuance of that great saving design and errand upon
   which it was determined he should come into this world. And this is
   that which the context here doth more specially lead us to insist upon.
   For when the apostle speaks of God doing all things according to the
   counsel of his own will, he tells us more distinctly what that counsel
   of his will did concern, and that is in the foregoing verse: "That, in
   the dispensation of the fulness of time, he might gather together in
   one, all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are in
   earth, even in him." This was the great thing that lay, as the
   substratum in the divine counsel, to collect and gather all things in
   Christ, to constitute him as supreme and universal Head to this
   creation. And whereas, all things were shattered and broken in the
   apostasy, there was now to be a recapitulation, and gathering all
   things under one head again, as you see in the close of the chapter.
   "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head
   over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him
   that filleth all in all." And this, that was primarily here designed in
   this, context, is that which God hath done according to the counsel of
   his will. "He doth all things after the counsel of his own will;" but
   this peculiarly, the sending of his Son into this world and the
   establishing of him as the Prince of those reduced from the state of
   apostasy. As the great destroyer of souls was the prince of the
   apostasy, the head of the apostate world, upon which account he is
   called "the God of this world." (2 Cor. iv. 4.) and "the spirit that
   worketh in the children of disobedience,'' so was our blessed Lord to
   be the head of that community that should be collected and gathered out
   of this world. And this was the great mystery of his will, which he
   purposed in himself, as the foregoing context is, "In the dispensation
   of the fulness of time" (by the Christian economy, that is the word
   there used for dispensation) to collect and gather, all under this one
   glorious head; to recover a people, and raise up a glorious structure,
   a church, out of a ruining and perishing world, by the Son and eternal
   God, who was made, in pursuance of this design, the universal Head,
   also Head over all things, but with special reference to his church.
   And so was this the matter of divine pleasure; to do this thing in the
   fulness of time, according as we find in Gal. iv. 4. "In the fulness of
   time, God sent his Son, born of a woman, made under the law, to redeem
   them that are under the law: that we might receive the adoption of
   sons." And as this is the most undoubted matter of divine purpose and
   decree, so it ought to be the matter of the highest joy and rejoicing;
   greater than can be expressed by an annual solemnity; such as should
   run through our lives, and be the matter of every day's rejoicing with
   us, according to what the first report of this glorious work was, when
   the womb of divine counsel did teem, and bring forth this glorious
   birth; when he brought forth the first be gotten, into the world, he
   saith, "Let all the angels of God worship him:" and they did publish
   the joyful proclamation of it from heaven, "Glory to God in the
   highest, and on earth peace good will towards men:" the greatest
   indication of divine good will, and the most significant that ever was
   known, or ever could be thought, that is, that when men had severed
   themselves from God, cut themselves off from him; and the world was
   sunk into a universal oblivion of him, destitute of all inclination
   towards him, and all interest in him, unapt to make any inquiries after
   him, or to say "Where is our God, our Maker?" that they should be so
   surprisingly told of Emmanuel, God with us: that God should so
   strangely descend, put on man, be manifested in the flesh, there was
   the greatest mystery of Godliness, that ought to fill heaven and earth
   with joy and with wonder. For when something like this was apprehended,
   but upon mistake, in what transports were these pagans! "The gods are
   come down to us in the likeness of men." Acts xiv. 11 And presently
   they offer at sacrificing. What matter of joy and wonder then, that the
   glorious, eternal Son of God, should make that descent, that kind
   descent, into this world of ours! Because we were partakers of flesh
   and blood, he himself likewise, takes part with us of the same: (Heb.
   ii. 14.) and because we dwelt in fleshly tabernacles, he himself
   resolved to erect a tabernacle like one of ours: "The word was made
   flesh, and dwelt among us:" (John i. 14.) did tabernacle among us is
   the expression: this being, as it were, his very sense in this
   vouchsafement and undertaking: "There is a company of poor creatures
   that dwell in flesh, or buried in it, rather than do dwell in it, and
   their flesh is more their grave than their mansion; well! because they
   are partakers of flesh and blood, and have tabernacles made of flesh,
   "I will go and set my tabernacle by theirs, they dwell in fleshly
   tents, and I will go and dwell in such a tent among them." The Son of
   God was made flesh, did dwell and tabernacle among us in such flesh as
   we inhabit, excepting the impurity and sinfulness of it, O! what matter
   of glory and exultation is this! How full of triumph should it fill the
   souls of men, that such a hope should arise to them, even as a
   resurrection from the dead! Now we see that God's kindness towards the
   children of men, is not shut up in everlasting oblivion; it is not
   suspended from any further exercise for ever; what a glorious instance
   of it is here!

   But as this is matter of highest joy, it ought to be matter of purest
   joy too. And there is not a little caution requisite in this case. The
   numerous appearance here this day signifies to me, that there is a
   great propension to keep on foot an annual solemnity upon this account:
   and as this is expressive of a disposition to rejoice, or to somewhat
   of rejoicing, I pray take these cautions in reference to it,--that it
   be not ignorant rejoicing, that it be not carnal rejoicing, and above
   all, that it be not wicked rejoicing, more grossly and more sensually
   wicked.

   (1.) Let it not be ignorant rejoicing. Rejoice we may, and must, in
   such a thing, that according to divine purpose and decree, Christ came
   into the world, and the Son of God became man, that he might become a
   sacrifice, and that there upon he might become a glorious King. To
   rejoice in this abstractly, that Christ was once born into this world,
   without understanding or ever desiring to understand what he was thus
   born for; what was the end of this manifestation and appearance of him
   in human flesh; this doth unbecome men, and much more doth it unbecome
   christians, it being to rejoice for they know not what. For what is it
   to us, if we abstract from the ends of the incarnation of the Son of
   God? if we subject not to the proper ends of it? What is it to us that
   Christ lived here on earth, somewhat above sixteen hundred years ago,
   and to rejoice in that he did so, without considering and understanding
   what it was for, upon what account it was, and with what design? This,
   I say, is but the joy of a fool: to rejoice in that, the true reason
   whereof, our own gross and voluntary ignorance hides from us; to
   rejoice when we hear that he came as a Saviour, without considering
   what he was to save us from, (though we are told at the same time,)
   when we hear of his being called Emmanuel, God with us, of his being
   called Jesus (Matt. i latter end) because he should save his people
   from their sins; to rejoice in Christ, even as an incarnate Saviour,
   without any thoughts of this, that I am to be saved by him, from that
   which made the distance, and continues the distance between God and me:
   I am to be saved by him from the impurities of my own heart and nature;
   I am to be saved by him from the vile carnality that hath depressed and
   sunk my soul so as never to mind God, never to desire after him, never
   to delight in him, to have inclinations to pray to him: I say, to
   rejoice ignorantly in these respects, is to rejoice presumptuously, for
   we know not what, and over confidently, against the direction and
   instruction given to us in that second psalm. Because God hath declared
   the decree concerning him, "Thou art my Son." and hath set him as his
   King upon his holy hill of Zion; and hath resolved to subdue the
   nations under him, and give him the heathen for his inheritance, and
   the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession, therefore to serve
   this mighty King with fear, and rejoice before him with trembling, that
   is the instruction that is given us. There is a pure and holy Deity
   hath become incarnate, the Son of God became, here, a God amongst us,
   with that resolution, not to bear with the wickedness of the world, and
   let men run on in their old and wonted course; but to revive God's
   memorial and the awe and fear of him in the hearts of men; and not to
   let men live prayerless lives, as they did, and without God in the
   world as they did; here was his great design. But now to rejoice in,
   Christ's having been born into the world, without ever considering the
   design of it: this is not only mean and brutish, but Insolent and
   presumptuous, to rejoice in the thoughts of so sacred and great a thing
   as this, without having hearts touched and impressed with the
   apprehension of the pure and holy end of it. And,

   (2.) Take heed of rejoicing carnally, with such a kind of joy as shall
   be exclusive of, or that shall exclude, that spiritual sense we ought
   to have of so high and mighty an under taking and intendment as this.
   How vain and how grossly incongruous and absurd is it to say, that
   because the Son of God came into this world upon such a design as you
   have heard, "Therefore, let us eat and drink and be merry, therefore,
   let us pamper and adorn this flesh;" forgetting that it is inhabited
   (even this mortal flesh) by an immortal spirit, and forgetting that
   even this flesh of ours is claimed and challenged to be a temple for
   the Holy Ghost, and therein made conformed to the flesh of Christ,
   which is itself such a Temple, and the mo del according to which, all
   Christian, temples, that is, a temple in a temple, in every Christian,
   ought to be formed. "Know ye not." saith the apostle, "that your bodies
   are the temples of the Holy Ghost?" (1 Cor. vi. 19.) and they are to be
   indulged and cared for accordingly. Christ speaks it of his own body,
   "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days!" As he was,
   even in his human nature, and in his body, a Temple of the living God,
   so is every Christian to be; and therefore, are these bodies of ours to
   be cared for in subserviency to this design. This body of mine, it is
   to be the living, animated temple of the Divine, Living Spirit. And
   what! is it then to be indulged, to be pampered, to be adorned with a
   fine dress, and is this all that I am to design concerning it? I am to
   design in it conformity to the great Original Temple, the Son of God.
   But to rejoice with such a sort of festivity as is only grateful to
   carnal and fleshly inclination, without any thought of being recovered
   and brought back to God by this Christ, of having my soul refined, and
   body and soul made meet to glorify the great God whose they both are:
   to joy without any thought of this, (I say) looks more like a pagan
   than a christian; and is much more suitable to the paganish than the
   Christian state. It ought to be considered, Christ took our flesh to
   make us partakers of his Spirit; he took our nature to make us
   partakers of his divine nature, escaping the corruptions that are in
   this world through lust: and to please ourselves in the thoughts of
   Christ having been born, without any thought of this, is such a
   carnality as affronts the very pretence that we make of rejoicing in
   the thoughts of it, that the Son of God did descend and come down to
   associate himself, and dwell among the sons of men in this world, and
   to suffer for them, and so to prepare them to dwell with God in the
   other world.

   (3.) But lastly, Take heed of such a kind of rejoicing as is more
   grossly and sensually wicked, even in itself and in its own nature:
   that is, to make the season when we, uncertainly, apprehend Christ to
   have been born into this world, the season of letting loose to all
   manner of looseness and debauchery, in direct contradiction to, and
   defiance of, the design of his coming: that is, when we know the Son of
   God was manifest to take away sin, and to destroy the works of the
   devil; as the expressions are, (1 John iii. 5, 8.) that we should make
   it our business to indulge and fulfil those very lusts which he came to
   destroy and dissolve and make cease out of (he world; what an affront
   is this to him whose memorial we pretend to celebrate! That is to make
   that which we imagine to be the day of his birth, to be the day of his
   most ignominious death, by crucifying afresh to ourselves the Son of
   God, and putting him to open shame, as if we would proclaim to the
   world, that the design of the Son of God's descent into it, was to give
   men the liberty of being safely wicked, that they might throw oft all
   restraint, and without any fear or dread of what should follow, abandon
   themselves to all manner of wickedness, to fulfil the impure lusts of a
   corrupt, depraved nature, till sin, being finished, should end in
   eternal death: and so make the Christian religion an inconsistency with
   itself, and to represent the matter, as if Christ came into the world,
   not to make men christians, but to exempt them from being so; and not
   to destroy sin out of the world, but to exclude and shut out
   Christianity, As if he came into the world that there might never be
   any such thing as Christianity in it, that he might bring it about,
   that men might, with safety and impunity, live in the highest rebellion
   against the very laws of that Christ by whom they pretend to expect
   salvation.

   But this is one great thing which we see lies under divine purpose and
   decree, according to the counsel of his will, the sending of his Son
   into the world to be a Redeemer and Saviour of sinners, by living among
   them, dying for them, conquering death, ascending to heaven, and
   erecting that kingdom by which he is to govern the redeemed community
   unto everlasting life. And by how much the more apparently this was
   matter of divine purpose according to eternal counsel, so much the
   higher and more dreadful wickedness must it needs be, to indulge in
   ourselves such a disposition of spirit, or so to shape our course that
   both shall lie counter to the divine counsels in all this. That is,
   when Christ did not come into the world by accident, but by design and
   by purpose, according to the wisest counsel, and eternal and most
   stable counsel, we should set ourselves, as much as in us is, to
   overturn the whole frame of that divine and eternal counsel of heaven;
   that is, that it shall never take place with me, "I will never be
   subject to him, I will never know him, never come into union with him,
   never resign up myself unto him; I will be mine own still, and live
   still at the utmost distance from God and defiance of him." By how much
   the more apparent this was the product of the divine will according to
   counsel, so more fearful and horrid must be the wickedness that stands
   in direct opposition thereto.

LECTURE II [16]

   But now to go on with other particular propositions about the decrees
   of God.

   7. That those terms of life and death for sinners, which God hath
   actually settled and published in his gospel, those we may be sure he
   did intend and purpose should be the terms of life and death unto us.
   Whatsoever, (as you have heard in the general propositions,) God
   actually doth, we may be sure he in tended and purposed to do. What he
   doth, he doth willingly when he doth it. No force can be put upon him;
   he never doth any thing against his will, and what he once willed he
   doth always will, for there can be with him no new will. Therefore,
   whereas, he hath enacted and published such things as these to the
   world, as the terms of life and death to sinners; that whosoever
   believes shall be saved, but whosoever believeth not shall be damned:
   that he gave his only begotten Son with that design, that they who
   believe in him should not perish, but have everlasting life; that they
   that believed not, are condemned already: they that believe, have
   everlasting life; they that believe not, shall not see life; but the
   wrath of God abideth on them: that sinners are to repent, that their
   sins may be blotted out; that they that repent shall not all alike
   perish: (Luke xiii. 3.) that the things that eye hath not seen, that
   the ear hath riot heard, and which have not entered the heart of man to
   conceive, are all prepared for them that love God: (1 Cor. ii. 9.) but,
   they that love him not, that love not the Lord Jesus, are so many
   anathema, accursed, till he come: (1 Cor. xvi. 22.) that Christ shall
   be the Author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him: (Heb. v.
   9.) but, that he shall come in flaming fire to take vengeance on them
   that know not God, and obey not the gospel of his Son; (2 Thess. i. 8.)
   these, I say, being the declared terms of life and death to sinners,
   enacted and actually published to the world as such, these you may be
   sure God did intend and purpose should be such. His purpose was
   eternal, and a decree, as that word was explained. This is out of all
   question, that such terms of life or death to sinners, as have been
   mentioned, are the matter of divine, eternal decree; he did always
   intend they should be so. Whence it is obvious to collect, that he can
   have no contrary decree, no contrary purpose. That is, wheresoever his
   pleasure is published and made known, so as to be capable to be
   understood about these matters, God will never deal with men upon other
   terms. There can be no repugnant purpose to any such purpose as this;
   that is to say, that he will save any whether they believe or no, or
   though they finally persist in obstinate infidelity and impenitency and
   rebellion against him to the last. It is never to be supposed, that he
   will do such a thing without decreeing it, so that he should have ever
   decreed it against such a decree as this. And so, on the other hand,
   that he will ever finally condemn, or hath ever decreed or purposed
   finally to condemn any that shall believe, that shall repent, that
   shall love him above all, and finally subject themselves to his
   government, whensoever they are brought to do so in Christ: therefore,
   it is vain and unscriptural, without foundation any way, for men to
   embolden themselves on the one hand, "Let me be never so wicked, or
   never so careless, I may be saved at last for all that; I do not know
   but God hath decreed to save me." Or, that any should torment
   themselves on the other hand with afflicting thoughts, "Let me do what
   I will, if I never so earnestly set myself, and seek help from heaven,
   that I may believe, that I may repent, that I may have my heart
   changed, renewed, and brought to love God, and subject myself to him in
   Christ, yet, there may be a decree against me and I may perish for all
   this." There is no reason, no foundation on the one hand or on the
   other, for any such imagined decree of God, against these plain
   declared decrees of his: they are (as to what is compendious and
   comprehensive of all) final believers who lie under the decree or
   purpose of salvation; and final infidels who lie under the decree or
   purpose of condemnation.

   So much, in general, is most certainly decreed, that they who believe
   shall be saved, and they that believe not, shall perish. But I further
   add,

   8. God hath not purposed this in the general, that he will save such as
   are wrought up to a compliance with his declared known terms of
   salvation; but whensoever he doth actually enable any to believe and
   repent, we may conclude that he did eternally intend so to do. And
   whosoever he doth actually conserve in a safe state, that is, enables
   them continually to believe, (it is enough to instance in this one
   thing, with which the rest are so essentially connected, that they are
   all implied, if this one be actually to be found, and even in the very
   mention of this one,) if he actually enable any to believe to the
   saving of their souls unto their final salvation, he did always from
   eternity, intend so to enable them. And so, he hath not only decreed,
   or intended certain indefinite and undeterminate species to life and
   salvation, but particular persons as is most evident many ways.

   (1.) Scripture is most express in it: if you look to the fore going
   verses, divers of them in this same chapter, you will find it. In what
   a transport, towards the beginning, do you find the apostle blessing
   God, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings, in heavenly places, (or
   things) in Christ. According as he hath chosen us in him, before the
   foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unblamable before
   him in love: having predestinated us, to the adoption of children by
   Jesus Christ unto himself; according to the good pleasure of his will,
   to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us
   accepted in the beloved." And in this same 11th. verse, where the text
   lies, "in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
   predestinated, according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
   after the counsel of his own will." And nothing, again, can be plainer
   than that known and famous text, Rom. viii. 30. "Moreover whom he did
   predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
   justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified." This is a
   chain that can never be broken; and equally expresseth that in the 2
   Thes. ii. 13. where the apostle gives solemn thanks, even for them,
   that God had chosen them unto salvation, through sanctification of the
   Spirit and belief of the truth. And in that, 1. Peter i. 2. "Elect
   according to the foreknowledge of God, through sanctification of the
   Spirit, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus." These (as it is
   observable, and was told you before, in those more general
   propositions,) do manifestly connect means and end together. But they
   do ascertain both, concerning some, and not leave the matter indefinite
   and undetermined, as if he did in the dark, make and form purposes with
   himself, without discerning, at the same time, who should comply with
   his pleasure, as to such terms of life, and who should not. And besides
   so express scriptures, the matter is,

   (2.) Evident in itself, that whomsoever he doth actually enable to
   comply with such terms of life and salvation, he did purpose and decree
   to enable. For when he doth so, when he gives a man faith, when he
   gives him repentance, which are most expressly said to be the gift of
   God: to you it is given to believe and suffer; (Phil. i. 29.) and
   Christ is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and
   remission of sins. Acts v. 31. I say, when he doth actually give these
   gifts, doth he give them with his will, or against his will? Is it to
   be supposed, that he should give them, and not will to give them? What
   could so impose upon him that he should give what he was not willing to
   give? But, if once he was willing, and if then he was willing to give
   such a gift, he was always willing; for there cannot be with him a new
   will, and therefore, he was from eternity willing. And again,

   (3.) That matter might be further argued, from what Scripture speaketh
   most expressly too, that as to that great and most comprehensive
   instance of faith in the Son of God; who soever do receive Christ and
   believe in his name, when God enables them so to do, he regenerates
   them; "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
   sons of God, even to as many as believed on his name." John i. 12. And
   then, it is immediately subjoined in the 13th. ver. "Who were born not
   of flesh nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." But if he
   do regenerate any, he doth it most willingly: "Of his own will begat he
   us, by the word of truth." James i. 18. Agreeable to the expression in
   the text, "He doth all things according to the counsel of his own
   will." He did with counsel, will to regenerate whomsoever he
   regenerates. And,

   (4.) It is altogether unimaginable, that God should do a thing so far
   exceeding all expectation, and even all wonder, as the sending of his
   own Son; he that was the brightness of his own glory, and the express
   image of his person, the Heir of all things, by whom he made the
   worlds; to be incarnate, to put on man, and to die upon a tree, so
   ignominiously, a spectacle to angels and men, and to leave it an
   undetermined thing whether any should be the better for it, yea, or no:
   or rather to leave it certain that none ever should be the better for
   it. For most certain it is, that as to those great terms, of life and
   salvation, none can ever be the better, if he do not, by his over
   powering grace, influence minds and hearts, and work them up to a
   compliance with those terms, and work and effect them in them. The case
   is vastly different in respect to spiritual good, and in reference to
   the opposite evil; where, as to wicked actions, and a continued course
   of them, or any particular act in such and such circumstances, men will
   al ways determine themselves; they are apt and prone enough to do so.
   If they can, in such and such circumstances, they will do wickedly: but
   in reference to any spiritual action that is good and holy, and of a
   saving tendency, there is not so much of an indifferency, but a most
   fixed aversion, which nothing but the power of divine grace can conquer
   and overcome. No thing but the almighty power of grace can make an
   enemy heart become friendly towards God, and towards his Christ, can
   vanquish the malignity of an obstinate infidelity, can mollify an
   obdurate, hard heart, and make it dissolve and melt as in repentance it
   must. This is, therefore, altogether an unimaginable thing, that God
   should do what did so far exceed all expectation, and even all wonder,
   as to send his own eternal Son, to die upon a cross, and leave it
   uncertain, whether any should ever be the better for it: or rather
   certain that none ever should. And it is again,

   (5.) Very unreasonable to think that the great God should have among
   men no objects of special favour; and it were foolish to suppose that
   it should be a reflection upon him to have it so. As it was formerly
   told you, it belongs only to a good governor, and even to the best that
   can be supposed, to deal equally with all; and kindly and favourably
   where he pleaseth. We are to distinguish matters of right, and matters
   of peculiar favour. Matters of right will be dispensed and administered
   with an equal hand, matters of special favour according to good
   pleasure, as it is expressed again and again, in the context. And plain
   it is, that there can be no natural right, which any creature can claim
   at the hand of God. Whatsoever becomes matter of right, from him to
   them, must only be by grace, by promise. He cannot be a debtor to his
   creature, till he makes himself so; and the promises by which he makes
   himself so, they se are all yea and amen in Christ;" (2. Cor. i. 20.)
   only upon his account, only for his sake. Whatsoever there is that
   comes within the compass of a promise, for the encouragement of sinners
   to return and come to God, it will all be made good to a tittle upon
   his account that is worthy, all promises being 4C yea and amen" in him.
   But whatsoever is above promise, more than promise, is all from mere
   eudokia, the good pleasure of his goodness. It can be resolved into
   nothing else, turn we the matter in our thoughts never so long. He will
   make good all that was promised to every one to a tittle; all
   unpromised, peculiar favour, that is dispensed according to the good
   pleasure of his goodness; even as his promises themselves at first
   were. And,

   (6.) Lastly: It is very evident that as to communications of grace and
   favour, God doth dispense very differently; and therefore, must be
   understood to intend so to do, and to have always intended it. As in
   the parable of the talents, (though parabolical scriptures do not give
   ground of argument as to every thing in them, yet they do as to their
   main scope,) he gives to one ten talents, to another five, to another
   one, as he pleaseth; he dispenseth as he pleaseth, wherein he hath not
   particularly obliged himself. But further,

   9. If yet he do actually, in a way of common grace, superadd more,
   wheresoever he hath given any thing of it, upon the due improvement of
   that, then we may conclude he hath always intended so to do; this was
   his pleasure, and his eternal purpose. If that be actually his rule,
   "to him that hath shall be given;" (you know how hath is to be taken
   here, that hath so as to improve what he hath,) he shall still have
   more; if this be actually the rule and measure of his proceedings, it
   was always his purpose it should be so. And so it must be under stood
   to have been his purpose, even in them that do finally perish, yet
   still to give them more of gracious communications in the way of common
   grace, upon the improvement of what they had; and they perish as not
   improving what was vouchsafed and afforded them, according to the
   tenour of that rule. They do not finally perish, as never having
   received any thing from the hands of God, in a way of grace, that had a
   tendency and leadingness in it to their better state, but they finally
   perish as neglecting and resisting such overtures as have been made to
   them. What the case was with the old world, before the flood, we must
   still suppose to be the common case among men. "My Spirit shall not
   always strive with man." Gen. vi. 3. It had been striving, and it is
   generally striving more or less; and especially where God doth afford
   the more peculiar manifestations of himself, as he did to that people
   whom he severed from the rest of the world, to be more appropriate to
   him. We have many passages that speak of the presence, and of the
   operations of the Divine Spirit, among that people. The Spirit of the
   Lord caused them to rest: He gave his Spirit to instruct them. Isaiah
   lxiii. 14. They rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore, he
   turned to be their enemy, and fought against them: ver. 10. and that of
   dying Stephen, "Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and life, ye
   do always resist the Holy Spirit, as your fathers did, so do ye." Acts
   vii. 51. Now, there cannot be a resistance where there is no striving,
   and there can be no striving where there is not a counter-striving.
   When the Spirit, in its more common operations, is resisted, it retires
   in displeasure, often and most righteously, and gives to men, yields to
   them that victory that shall be in the end fatal to them, undoing to
   them; many such victories undo them at last, and they perish by them.
   If he be actually working in men to will and to do of his own good
   pleasure, when he is ever so at work in any, he injects thoughts into
   their hearts, smites their minds with convictions, and their hearts
   many times with terrors; or if there be any more placid affections
   raised in them in any degree towards himself, or towards any divine
   thing, and the matter go no further than a loseable taste, that may
   vanish and pass away, it is plain he so far went of good pleasure; and
   if he did that which he did of good pleasure, then it was before his
   good pleasure, and always his good pleasure, and eternally his good
   pleasure, to proceed so far with such and such: so as in this case
   there can be no pretence to say, if he go no higher, that wrong is done
   to them with whom he went no higher. It must be justly said, "Friend I
   do thee no wrong," even to the most careless neglector, and the most
   contemptuous abuser of the grace of God, "Friend I do thee no wrong."
   If he do proceed higher, and to less vincible workings with some, there
   is no cause any man's eye should be evil, because his eye is good. He
   is Lord of his own grace, he may do what he will with his own. What he
   hath to dispense, and dispose of, is his, and they to whom he is to
   dispose so and so are his, and there is no pretence of wrong to any,
   that more is not done for them; for whom more was done than they could
   lay any original claim to; for it was all of mercy that there was any
   offer or overture made at all, or that the case was so stated before,
   as that it might have been possible, if it had not been through their
   own wicked neglect, that they that perish might have advanced in the
   way of salvation, according to his method, still further and further,
   so as not to make their own final salvation a thing impossible upon any
   other terms, than their own wilful neglect and final refusal. But I
   again further add,

   10. That such as live quite without the sound of the gospel, and to
   whom every thing of supernatural revelation hath never been vouchsafed
   or any thing of it, how God hath determined to deal with them, and the
   infants of such, he hath not yet declared further his pleasure to us
   expressly, than it was needful for us to know and understand. And
   therefore, it would be either vain or overbold curiosity to determine
   positively in their case, and it is very unreasonable and foolish,
   oversolicitously to inquire about it. It is enough for us to understand
   and know upon what terms God will deal with us, according to those
   circumstances wherein he hath placed and set us: he hath placed us
   under the dispensation of his gospel, wherein all things are made plain
   and evident to us, that concern us in reference to our present and
   eternal state, and will deal with us according to those known and
   published terms, which stand in so clear a light, before our eyes; and
   with all others according to those measures they have had. It is enough
   for us to understand and know what we may, as our case is stated,
   expect from God, and what God doth expect from us. And, it would be
   very unreasonable, and uncharitable, for us to trouble ourselves with
   further inquiries, and it would be very bold to venture on rash
   determinations in those more obscure things, and wherein we are so
   little concerned. These are to pass among the arcana, that secret
   things belong to God, when revealed things belong to us, and our
   children after us, as they shall come to be revealed to them. Deut.
   xxix. 29. A passage placed, as it were, on purpose to caution, and warn
   too busy and bold inquirers, and that, even in matters of unspeakably
   less concernment than the eternal salvation of souls. As suppose, that
   the people, for that is the case there supposed and refer red to, who
   had been so peculiar to God, taken nigh to him, above, and from, all
   other people and nations under heaven, should apostatise and revolt
   from him, and draw down vindictive judgments, and destructive ones upon
   themselves, and inquiry be made how it comes to pass, that such a
   people, so near to God, should be so treated and dealt withal, their
   land laid waste and made a wilderness, and nothing to be found but
   marks of divine vengeance, where such a people, so favoured by heaven
   did dwell, what is the meaning of all this? Why, they forsook the Lord
   their God! But that might have been prevented: Why did he not hold them
   to him? "Secret things belong unto God, but revealed things to us and
   our children." So is that sad and dismal state concluded and shut up at
   last, with that seal upon it! That, therefore, I would leave with you,
   as all I think needful to say, with reference to their case who lie
   without the compass of superadded divine revelation. Again, I further
   add,

   11. That whereas faith and its concomitants are ever to be found in
   that, which appears to be at length the subject of God's purpose of
   saving souls; and final infidelity, with its concomitants, are the
   characters of the subjects of the contrary purpose, a purpose to
   condemn with everlasting destruction; these must very differently be
   understood to be so. Faith, for instance, and so of the rest of its
   concomitants are never looked upon by God as any causes, or conditions,
   or inducements, any way, of his purpose to save any. These are by his
   grace to be found in the subjects, in those that he will save; but they
   are no inducements to pass any such determination concerning them. It
   is honourable to him to save such: and, even in the nature of the
   thing, they only are capable of final salvation and blessedness, in
   whom such characters are to be found: for they can never be happy in
   union with the eternal truth and goodness, who are habitually averse in
   their temper, and opposite to the one and the other. If happiness
   result from such a union, then they, in whom there is a prevailing
   final aversion to eternal truth and goodness, are uncapable of any such
   felicity, as is to result from a union with these. But it is no motive
   or inducement to God, to intend to save such a one, because he will be
   a believer, or he will be a penitent person. That he is a believer,
   that he is a penitent person, that he is a lover of him, and that he is
   obedient to his Son, these are the effects of his grace, and of his
   good pleasure, and so he is moved in this case by nothing without
   himself. But the case must be understood to be otherwise, as to those
   that he intends finally to punish, and to punish with ever lasting
   destruction. That is, he doth resolve to deal with them suitably to the
   state of things between him and them, and with himself. If any inquire,
   why there should be a difference, why he should be moved to purpose so
   and so, in reference to them that perish, (which purpose we are not to
   consider abstractly as it lies in God alone, for so it is not a
   distinct thing from his own essence of which there can be no cause; but
   we are to consider it with a reference to the effects and to the
   objects, and of that relation there is really a cause, and so there is
   a just cause for the condemnation of them that perish, even from the
   creature: but there can be no cause from the creature, of them that are
   saved) I say, if you will have the reasons assigned of the difference,
   they are obvious and plain, especially these two.

   (1.) That there is no natural connection between the imperfect faith
   and holiness of the saints, and their eternal felicity; no natural
   connection, I say, at all between them. But there is a most natural
   connection between the infidelity, enmity against God, and reigning
   wickedness, and eternal ruin and everlasting misery. No man can say
   that these two are naturally connected, an imperfect faith in God,
   through Christ, and imperfect holiness, and final felicity and
   blessedness. These are not so naturally connected that the one must
   arrive to the other. But there is a most plain, natural connection
   between infidelity and disbelief of divine truth, enmity against divine
   goodness, repudiation and refusal of the offers and tenders thereof,
   and eternal misery: so as that the one of them cannot but be the other.
   Wickedness must be misery, sin persisted in to the last must be
   destruction, it cannot be otherwise; sin when it is finished can be
   nothing but death. "To be carnally minded is death:" it is indeed said,
   "to be spiritually minded is life and peace:" but that is by an
   intervening divine constitution. And though there be a constitution in
   the other case too, yet there is a most natural connection between
   total prevailing wickedness, reigning iniquity, and misery; to which
   the supervening constitution is added to an indication of the righteous
   judgment of God, that he doth but let the thing be with such as it is.
   They love death; and he only lets them have what they love, and what
   they choose: he doth only not interpose in their case to break the
   connection. And,

   (2.) There is this manifest difference too; that as there is a natural
   connection between wickedness and misery, whereas there is none between
   imperfect faith and holiness and eternal felicity, otherwise than what
   God hath graciously made; so there is in final, reigning, persevering
   wickedness, the highest desert of eternal misery: whereas, there is in
   imperfect faith and holiness no desert of eternal life and blessedness.
   And none that consider, will think this strange, that when a man can
   never deserve (much less by what is merely gratuitously wrought in him)
   life and blessedness; yet, by continuing, persevering wickedness he may
   deserve to perish. That imperfect good that is wrought in him and which
   he owes not to himself, can never deserve life and blessedness for him.
   But total wickedness, yea, or any wickedness can deserve death, can
   deserve for a man's being left to be finally miserable and his falling
   under divine vindicta, vengeance: this is a divine nemesis, what is fit
   and righteous, what is fit the righteous Judge of all the earth should
   do; even animadvert upon wickedness, and testify his own just
   abhorrence and detestation of it, so that there is a vast difference
   between these two: that though faith and holiness be in those that
   shall be saved; and so are ever to be found in the subject of God's
   purpose to save, as characteristical of the subject, but are not
   inducements, or causes or motives thereof unto God: yet, wheresoever
   God hath purposed to condemn, their wickedness is a just motive of that
   purpose, so terminated, so related to the creature, that is, to suffer,
   and to the suffering that he is to undergo. There is something justly
   causative in this; and there is nothing more strange in all this, than
   what God hath himself, in his word, so plainly told us, that men's
   destruction is of themselves, but their help in order to salvation
   should be found in him alone. Hos. xiii. 9. It is no unsuitable or
   strange thing, that God should be eyed as the Author of all life, and
   all grace, and all blessedness, and of life and of felicity for ever.
   And, that sinners should be looked upon as the fountains of all evil
   and all darkness and all impurity and all misery to themselves only,
   God must determine men only to that good by which they are to be led on
   gradually to a blessed, safe, and happy state. But to that evil that
   tends to ruin and final destruction, men have it in themselves to
   determine themselves. More is yet to be added to illustrate this.

LECTURE III. [17]

   But before I proceed further, I think fit to premonish thus much, and
   declare to you, that I would not, as to these matters be understood to
   deny every thing that I do not assert about them, nor to assert
   whatsoever I do not deny: for my design is only to propose to you what
   is plain, and what is useable and may be improved unto the common
   purposes of Christianity. There are a great many things besides, that
   many have concerned themselves to dispute to and fro, which I think it
   not at all needful or useful to be brought into such discourse.

   But now, that the matter last insisted on, may yet be clearer and more
   plain. If we speak of this natural bodily life, you can very easily
   understand that that is in any man's power, it is within the compass of
   human power that ordinarily men have, for a man to give himself a
   mortal wound, but, having done so, it is not within the compass of
   human power to heal him again; and that, in reference to the natural
   connection between the one of those forementioned things and the other,
   and in reference to the moral and legal connection that is asserted
   between them; we may again illustrate it by a resemblance of it to the
   concernments of this natural bodily life. It is in the power of any one
   that dares venture to be so far criminal, to deserve death at the hands
   of the prince and the law, whereas, it may be no way in his power, when
   he hath done so, to deserve the prince's pardon and to have his
   forfeited life given him again. These are things, in themselves plain
   to any understanding. And now, whereas the text hath plainly told us,
   that God works all things after the counsel of his own will, this doth
   manifestly imply, that the determinations must be correspondent to the
   aptitudes of things, and most especially to the apt agreement which
   they shall hold with the universal perfection of his own nature. Now it
   is no blemish to the perfection of the Divine Nature, when things are
   so and so connected in themselves, naturally and morally, to let things
   in many instances stand just as in themselves they are. This is no
   reflection on the divine perfection; that is, where there is a real
   connection between wickedness and misery, both natural and moral or
   legal, it is no reflection upon the perfection of the Divine Nature, in
   many instances to let that connection be as it is. And whereas, there
   is no connection between imperfect faith and holiness, and perfect
   felicity and blessedness, (there is, in reality, no connection between
   these) it is no blemish to the divine perfection (if there be really,
   and if there be in nature, and as yet any other way between these two,
   no connection) to make one by grace, in what instances he pleaseth;
   that being done (as the gospel tells us) upon the Redeemer's account,
   who it was predetermined should so order the course of his management,
   even to dying itself, and in dying, that no divine perfection should
   reluctate or reclaim against such a connection as this; a connection to
   be made by grace when before it was not, when really it was not,
   between that imperfect faith and holiness that some should be enabled
   to in this world and their future felicity and blessedness in the other
   world. All comes to this sum, that is, that we can both effect and
   deserve our own death and misery; but we can neither effect nor deserve
   life and blessedness: that must be owing to divine favour and grace.
   And the case (as hath been often said) is vastly different in
   dispensing of punishments and free favours. It being no reflection upon
   the best government that can be supposed either to inflict deserved
   punishments, or to dispense undeserved favours. Neither of these can
   reflect on the best and most perfect government that can be thought. I
   now go on and add further,

   12. That the assertion of a decree of reprobation, antecedent to a
   decree of condemnation for infidelity and wickedness persisted in to
   the last, is that which may seem agreeable to the imperfect mind of
   man; but we cannot be so sure that it will be any way agreeable unto
   the most perfect mind of God, in which there can be no such thing as
   first and second, and unto which all things lie open at once, even unto
   one entire and eternal view. We are very plainly told in Scripture, of
   some men's being ordained of old unto condemnation: in that 4th verse
   of the epistle of Jude, and in the same place we have the characters
   given us of them that are so: "ungodly men, turning the grace of God
   into lasciviousness, denying the only Lord God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ." We are sure of such a decree as doth doom such, continuing
   such unto the last, unto condemnation and eternal perdition: but that
   there should be any decree concerning such, prior to this, that must
   suppose priority and posteriority in Eternum. But Eternum non patitur
   novum, there can be no such thing as novity, newness, in eternity. And
   therefore, being sure there is such a decree as this, and that this
   decree is eternal, we may be equally sure there can be no decree
   pre-existent to it; because every thing in God is co-eternal to him,
   and so this decree must be co-eternal unto God himself; and there can
   be nothing before God. And though it be very true, indeed, that many
   have taken much pains and given great exercise to their thoughts to
   assign and fix some certain order of former and latter, to the divine
   decrees, yet that doth only proceed from the imperfection of their
   minds; but we are sure it is impossible there can be any such thing as
   priority and posteriority in the Divine Mind; all things lying open to
   him at one eternal and entire view at once: so that whensoever he
   beholds and looks upon the subjects of final misery, he sees their
   character at the same time, and it cannot be otherwise. And again, I
   add,

   13. That will or decree, or purpose of God by which he doth determine
   the salvation of any, it is, in the proper time and season, effective
   of whatsoever is pre-requisite thereunto: that is, if he have decreed
   he will save such and such, that same will of his is, in the proper
   season, effective of that faith, of that repentance, of that holiness
   and of that perseverance which is requisite to their final salvation.
   But, on the other hand, God's will to punish any with future misery is
   not effective of what concurs to that, neither as naturally causing or
   deserving it. That is sin that doth both, as you have heard; it doth
   both naturally cause it and deserve it too. And, if you ask here, "What
   is the reason of the difference; or is there not a parity of reason in
   both cases, that if his will doth effect what is necessary to the
   salvation of the one, his will should also effect what is necessary or
   doth any ways previously concur to the destruction of the other?" The
   reason of the difference is most manifest upon these two accounts.

   (1.) That sin is properly, as such, no effect but a defect, and
   therefore, it doth not need an effective cause but a defective only.
   But we will impute nothing of defectiveness to God: that can be found
   no where but in the creature. And,

   (2.) That we can (sure any one may) apprehend it a great deal more
   congruous and suitable, to the nature and honour of God to make men
   believing and holy than to make them unbelieving and wicked. We can
   easily apprehend how well it agrees to the nature of God, and how
   subservient it is to the glory of God, to make men believing and holy;
   but no man can ever apprehend it agreeable to his nature, or
   subservient to his honour, to make men disbelieving and wicked. And
   therefore, as we make the difference, I cannot but apprehend you see
   reason enough why we should. And then further, take this,

   14. That for these distinct states of blessedness and misery, unto
   which the will of God doth determine some, and leave others, they are
   the only states of men hereafter, and there is not a middle state
   between these two, though there be great intermediate degrees between
   the highest pitch of felicity and the lowest of misery. There are, I
   say, very great intermediate degrees, but not a middle state. This
   proposition hath two parts:--that there is no middle state, and
   yet--that there are great intermediate degrees, both of blessedness and
   misery.

   (1.) As to the former part, that there is no intermediate or middle
   state between these two: it cannot, without very great absurdity, be so
   much as conceived there should be; besides that it is against the most
   express tenour of Scripture. I need not go about to quote texts to you.
   Look to the judgment of the great day. Matt. xxv. Men are judged but to
   two distinct states; all go one of these two ways. And it is
   unconceivable in itself that there should be a distinct intermediate
   state: for it would be to suppose that there can be such a thing as an
   intelligent, reasonable creature, having the use of his faculties,
   (which death, we have a great deal more reason to apprehend, doth
   promote rather than hinder,) and neither happy nor miserable. This is
   an unconceivable thing, equally unconceivable as it would be, that
   there should be such a creature under a law, under government, (as
   reasonable creatures even as such, either positive or natural at
   least,) that should be neither good nor bad, that should neither be
   obedient nor disobedient, holy nor wicked, and this you know to be an
   impossible thing. And that is enough as to the former part of the
   proposition. But then,

   (2.) As to the latter part, that there are great intermediate degrees
   both of happiness and misery, that is plain from most express
   scriptures. It is less needful to insist upon the degrees of
   blessedness in the other state, about which the Scripture is plain
   enough. There will be such a difference as these appears to be of one
   star differing from another star in glory. 1 Cor. xv. 41. But chiefly
   as to the differing degrees of misery; nothing is plainer from such
   passages in Scripture:--"They that know their master's will, and do it
   not, shall be beaten with many stripes; they that do it not, not
   knowing it, with fewer." Luke xii. 47, 48, "It will be more tolerable
   for Sodom and Gomorrah, for Tyre and Sidon, in the clay of judgment,
   than for Capernaum and Bethsaida, where so much gospel light shone; and
   where so glorious works were done, to evidence and demonstrate the
   truth of the gospel." Matt. xi. 22. And there is a sort among them that
   do perish, which do perish more dreadfully. Such and such, it is said,
   shall have their portion with hypocrites, (Matt xxiv. 51.) which must
   be supposed the most fiery, in the worst and hottest hell. God will not
   lay upon men more than is right, that any should enter into judgment
   with him, as the expression in Job is. And therefore, we must suppose
   the case to be vastly different between them that live under the gospel
   and them that do not. "They that sin without law, shall perish without
   law;" (Rom. ii. 12.) but with a gentler kind of perdition. But they
   that sin under the law, that is, under the divine Revelation, for that
   is the meaning of the law there, supernatural, divine Revelation, they
   shall be judged by it: not by that light which they have not, or those
   means of light which they never had, but by those which they have. But
   whereas, there will be very great degrees of difference in the states
   of the miserable hereafter, how great that difference will be, that we
   know not. It is enough that we know it will be very great; and
   therefore, among them that are miserable, none will be punished
   unsuitably to the demerit of their own sins. And this ought to have its
   weight with us, in order to the repressing of undue and hard thoughts
   concerning the divine proceedings with men in the final judgment: and
   so, concerning his purposes and determinations before, and from,
   eternity.

   But I think it not necessary to say more to you by way of position;
   yet, there are sundry things that I shall add by way of caution. As,

   1. That we should take heed of being too positive about any of these
   things, beyond the measure of divine Revelation, or too curious in
   inquiring, or too contentious in disputing about such matters. Let us
   labour to lay a restraint upon our spirits as to these things. The
   matter requires it, and the divine word requires it.

   2. Never depart from, nor doubt of, what God hath expressly revealed:
   in reference to what he hath expressly revealed, let us neither deviate
   nor doubt; but take heed lest we do. And,

   3. Take heed that we do not oppose the secret and revealed will of God
   to one another, or allow ourselves so much as to imagine an opposition,
   or contrariety between them. And that ground being once firmly laid and
   stuck to, as it is impossible that there can be a will against a will
   in God, or that he can be divided from himself, or against himself, or
   that he should reveal any thing to us as his will, that is not his
   will, (it being a thing inconsistent with his nature, and impossible to
   him to lie,) that being, I say, firmly laid, (as nothing can be firmer
   or surer than that,) then measure all your conceptions of the secret
   will of God, by his revealed will, about which you may be sure. But
   never measure your conceptions of his revealed will by his secret will;
   that is, by what you may imagine concerning that. For you can but
   imagine, while it is secret, and so far as it is unrevealed.

   4. Take heed of exalting any one divine perfection to the depressing of
   another, which men are too prone to do in their more fervent disputes
   about these matters. Great heat and zeal appear to vindicate such a
   particular divine perfection without attending, that at the same time
   they intrench upon some other. It were very easy to give instances.
   Some on the one hand are so much for the magnifying of the goodness of
   God, his love and his justice, (as they think,) that they quite
   overlook his sovereignty, make nothing of that, but guide their
   thoughts by such measures, as if they thought, that God was obliged by
   his goodness, or even by his justice, to do so with his own creatures,
   whom he hath so freely produced and brought forth into being out of
   nothing, as they may do with their fellow creatures. As if God were
   bound to observe the same measures as they do, and had no more power
   and dominion over the works of his own hands, than they have over one
   another, who cannot give one another so much as a moment's breath. And
   on the other hand, some are so over apt to exalt and magnify the divine
   sovereignty, that they quite forget to consider him as a wise and
   righteous and holy and good God; in all these, the best and most
   perfect of beings, This is quite forgot, and scarce any other notion
   doth actually obtain; though otherwise these are not denied, are only
   not denied, but in the mean time they are overlooked; and so hardly any
   other notion is brought in view, or upon the stage concerning God, than
   as of an almighty will, quite against the manifest scope and current of
   the Scripture every where, which makes all excellencies to be in him,
   and magnifies his wisdom, and his righteousness, and his love and
   goodness, at so high a rate, as you know. But to suppose the Divine
   Nature to consist but in an omnipotent will, not guided by wisdom and
   counsel, as the text speaks, "He doth all things according to the
   counsel of his own will:" is the strangest and most unshapen notion of
   God; and, in the tendency of it, most destructive to religion that can
   be conceived. It tends, indeed, to engenerate in the minds of men, a
   certain dread and horror: but is that the affection that is to
   influence religion, and to animate our worship? There can be no worship
   that doth not proceed from a dutiful reverential love: and agreeable
   hereunto, must be still our notions of God. Heathens themselves that
   speak at so high a rate (some of them) of the divine excellencies, and
   particularly of his goodness, exalting that far above his power, and
   above his knowledge, and above his wisdom; yet they, at the same time,
   say of him, "He is an impartial law;" and they comprehend in that, both
   goodness and righteousness, according to the strict measures whereof he
   manageth the whole course of his dispensations towards his creatures,
   and cannot but do so. He is a law that equally inclines every way, an
   impartial law he is to himself in all his dispensations. And indeed,
   such love and goodness in a ruler, as should include in it an
   insensibleness of injuries and indignities, and affronts, it were
   stupidity; it were inconsistent with the proper governing
   qualifications which are requisite in any ruler whatsoever. And again,

   5. Take this further by way of caution: Let us take very great heed
   that we do not, in reference to these things, so magnify human
   perfection as to depress divine; for that, in this affair, too many are
   apt to do; that is, to ascribe so much to the reason and will of man,
   as to detract most injuriously from the counsel of the will of God.
   Some think they know not how to solve the difficulties in these
   affairs, without ascribing greatly and highly to the reason and will of
   man. And all ought to be ascribed thereunto that is due; that is, so
   much as doth render a man a governable creature, capable of being bound
   by a law, and of being dealt with in the way of moral government. So
   much must be ascribed and ought to be so. It would be otherwise, as fit
   and congruous to have given laws, and assigned rewards and punishments
   to beasts and trees, as men, if we do not preserve the apprehension of
   man's capacity to be the subject of government, by reason and will,
   wherewith God hath endowed his nature. But to think that the reason and
   will of man are, of themselves, enough to enable him to all that is
   requisite to his future felicity, is to make a god of him, instead of a
   man, and to put him into his Maker's throne, to give him a
   self-sufficiency, as if he had enough in himself to do all things. And
   this, indeed, is so to magnify the reason and will of man, as upon the
   matter to nullify the counsel of the divine will in reference unto him;
   by which we find the methods are described and set, in which he is to
   expect continual aids and assistances, as being of himself, without
   them, able to do nothing. And,

   6. Take heed, hereupon, of being tempted to take up with a spiritless
   religion, that shall be only a human product, the effect only of a
   man's own power. Take heed of taking up such a repentance, and such a
   faith, and such an obedience as the power of man is sufficient for:
   that will certainly lurch men at last. That repentance, and that faith,
   and that holiness, (if any other were to have the names,) which is not
   produced by the Divine Spirit, but is short of that, must needs leave
   men short of heaven and eternal glory; unless you would suppose it
   possible to a man to be his own Saviour out of such a gulf of sin and
   misery as men are sunk into.

   7. Take heed of admitting any distrustful thoughts, that God will not
   be always ready to afford his communicated, superadded light and
   influence to those that see and acknowledge their own impotency and
   nothingness. Such as see themselves lost, and unable to help
   themselves, and that, from a sense of indigency and want, cry for his
   Spirit (even as for bread) to enlighten them and empower them, and
   enable them to do his will, to comply with his call, and come up to his
   terms of life and blessedness: take heed of ever admitting a
   distrustful thought concerning his readiness to impart and communicate
   to such. He will give his Spirit to them that ask him; when he is
   considerately asked and sought to: not formally, not slightly, not in
   words of course; but as feeling our own blindness and darkness and
   deadness and impotency: or where there is not, as yet, the light of a
   saint, there is that of a man, and that is to be improved and made use
   of, in order to our higher light, and if there be that self reflection
   to which God hath given to every man a natural ability, much more may
   be known than usually is. It belongs to the nature of man to turn his
   eyes inwards. The mind of a man (like the sun can only project its
   beams and cast them about this way and that, and every way,) the mind
   of a man, I say, as an intellectual sun, can turn its beams inward upon
   itself and take cognizance of what is done within him; and what
   dispositions and indispositions are within. Men can reflect and
   consider this with themselves: "Have not I an aversion towards God?
   have not worldly concernments and affairs, by the natural inclination
   of my own mind, a greater room and place there than heaven and the
   things of heaven? are not other thoughts more grateful? and have they
   not a more pleasant relish with me than the thoughts of God?" Men, I
   say, are capable of using such reflections as these. And thereupon, of
   considering, "This can never be well with me: if there remain with me
   an habitual aversion to God, who must be my best and eternal good, I
   cannot but he eternally miserable: if I cannot think of him, and
   converse with him with inclination and pleasure, I am lost. If my
   blessedness lie above, in another world, and my mind is earned
   continually downward towards this world, I must have a heart at
   tempered to heaven, or t can never come there. Well then let me try if
   I can change the habit of my own mind, make the attempt, make the
   trial." The more you attempt and try, the more you will find that of
   yourselves you cannot; you can do nothing of yourselves, you do but
   lift at a heavy log, you at tempt to move a mountain upwards, when you
   would lift at your own terrene hearts. Then, is this consideration
   obvious, "I must have help from heaven, or I shall never come there."
   Therefore, fall a seeking, fall a supplicating, as one that apprehends
   himself in danger to perish and be lost, if he have not another heart,
   a believing heart, a holy heart, a heavenly heart. God will in this
   case give his Spirit; and of that, you are not to despair by any means.
   Take heed therefore, of setting the imagination of a secret will of God
   not to give his Spirit, against his plain and most expressly revealed
   will, that he will give his Spirit to them that ask it, that is, that
   do considerately ask it, as apprehending the state of their case; not
   ask it slightly and in mockery, so as that the manner of their asking
   to have the Divine Spirit given should imply a contempt of the gift at
   the same time.

LECTURE IV. [18]

   And I will add, further, to this caution, that we take very great heed
   that we do not remit either our diligence, or our hope, in reference to
   the affairs of our salvation, upon the supposition of any divine
   counsel or purpose lying against us; and to enforce this, (than which
   nothing is more necessary to be enforced,) I might reason two ways,
   partly ad hominem, partly, ad rem.

   (1.) Ad hominem. That is, from the common apprehension and practice of
   men in reference to other cases. It is very plain that all the other
   concernments of men, are as much determined by divine counsel and
   decree, as the affairs and concerns of their souls and future estate.
   But it is as plain that men are not wont to suspend their actions, in
   common cases, upon mere supposition of such purposes and counsels of
   God, that may, for ought they know, lie against them in such cases. It
   would make very strange work in the world if they should; if men should
   suspend their actions in reference to common affairs of human life
   merely upon the supposition that a decree may be against them. What a
   condition would it reduce things to among men on earth! The whole world
   would be at a stand, or would be sitting still, and would sit still in
   very uneasy postures too. The husbandman must never plough nor sow, for
   he might say, "I do not know but there is a decree against me, that all
   will come to nothing, I shall have no crop, I shall lose all my labour
   and expence." The merchant should never send or go to sea; no man
   should ever make a meal, be cause he doth not know but that it may be
   determined that it shall poison and hot nourish him, choke him and not
   refresh him. Men should not walk the streets, for they do not know but
   that there may be some decree or other that a tile shall fall and
   strike them dead, or they may meet with a stab in their walk: nor
   should they sit still in the house neither, for they do not know but
   that there may be such a decree that the house may fall and bury them
   in the ruins. Plain it is, men do not in common cases suspend their
   actions upon such suppositions; but then it argues very great
   insincerity, and a very ill temper of mind, that men should only pick
   out their weightiest and most important concerns, and do nothing in
   reference to them, merely upon such an imagination that there may be
   some purpose, or something in the divine counsel lying against them. It
   argues, I say s a very ill mind; that there is some peculiar
   disaffection to God, and to the way of holiness and to religion as
   such, that men should only lay themselves under restraint in reference
   to those great concernments of religion, when they have as much cause,
   and the same pretence in reference to all things as they have in
   reference to this, And again,

   (2.) We may argue Ad rem, or from the true, real state of the case
   itself; that is, that there is no supposable divine purpose but what is
   guided by counsel, and that no one hath any reason to fear that the
   divine counsel can be any way prejudicial to him, even to an honest
   affair or undertaking, that belongs to the human life itself. For they
   are always to be considered as the counsels of an absolutely,
   infinitely perfect Being, whose nature is uncapable of any thing of
   malignity towards his creatures; (for it is the most perfect benignity
   and goodness itself, "God is love;") and therefore, that any supposable
   counsel of the divine will, in reference to our common affairs
   themselves, are a great deal more encouraging than they can be
   discouraging; yea, unspeakably more, in reference to these affairs,
   supposing we will but take up due thoughts of God about them, and have
   correspondent, due dispositions of heart and spirit towards him: for we
   are pre-assured by his own express word, that all things shall work
   together for good to those that love God; which love, will be the
   evidence of a man's being called according to his purpose, as these
   things lie connected in that Rom. viii. 28. There is no son or servant
   of common understanding and ingenuity, but it will be a very great
   encouragement and satisfaction to him to act in all things under the
   conduct and direction of a parent or master, that he knows to be a man
   of counsel, as well as of the greatest goodness; it will certainly be
   most satisfying and encouraging to any such one. And how unspeakably
   more will it be to any, to think, that whatsoever affairs that lie
   within the compass of human life, I have to manage, I am to manage and
   order them all under the conduct and direction of the wise counsel of a
   good, and gracious, and holy God; whence L may be sure he will never
   hinder me in any such enterprize and undertaking of mine, unless it
   appear to his infinite wisdom, that it will be to my hurt, that it will
   turn to my prejudice. If it shall be for the best for me, it shall
   succeed, if it shall not succeed, it would be to my disadvantage if it
   should. The tendency of all this is to compose men's spirits to the
   greatest quietude and tranquillity imaginable, in reference even to the
   common affairs of human life. This word is firmer and more stable than
   the foundations of heaven and earth, that alt things shall work
   together for good to them that love God: nothing can come amiss to a
   lover of God, to one, who by the Divine Spirit working in him, is
   contempered in the habitual frame of his spirit to the divine pleasure.
   And the disposition of all things cannot but work together for good to
   such a one.

   But, whereas, it may be said, "What if I do not love God? what if I
   find not that disposition in my heart and soul to him, what shall I do
   then?" Why,

   [1.] I would appeal to such a one, How perverse a notion must you needs
   have of God, if you think him to be such a one that he should equally
   take care, that all things should work together for good to men,
   whether they love him or love him not? that he should as much gratify
   them that hate him, as them that love him! You must suppose, in this
   case, some what in its own nature impossible: for it is simply
   impossible that any thing can succeed well with a man that loves not
   God. He must be the son of peace, or good cannot come to him: it can
   take no place in him. But what I have further to say is this, which in
   the second place I designed to say in arguing this matter ad rem. That
   is,

   [2.] That supposing a man be not a lover of God, an habitual lover of
   him, so as he can discern this to be the predominant governing
   principle in him; yet he hath greater encouragement in reference to the
   affairs of his soul, (supposing them to lie in this state,) than he can
   have in reference to his external estate here in this world. For do we
   ever find any such promises in the word of God, that whosoever labours
   to be rich shall be rich? or that he that takes care of his health
   shall be always healthy; as we have, that he that labours to be saved
   shall have help from heaven in order thereunto? "Work out your own
   salvation with fear and trembling, for God worketh in you to will and
   to do of his own good pleasure," Phil. ii. 12, 13. He is working: (so
   the word signifies:) what he doth herein, he doth according to good
   pleasure, and he is still doing and working in you. Therefore, there
   can be no purpose or counsel in the divine will, lying against this
   plain word of his. So that none can have any pretence to be less
   laborious, less diligent in reference to the affairs of their souls,
   than they have in reference to their common affairs. Yea, there is a
   great deal of reason why they should be much more, and that they should
   conjoin hope with their diligence in reference there unto; which I
   mention in this conjunction, because we find them so conjoined in
   Scripture; and they are conjoined in the nature of the thing. We find
   them conjoined, Heb. vi. 11. "That ye shew the same diligence unto the
   full assurance of hope unto the end: that ye be not slothful, but
   followers of them who through faith and patience have inherited the
   promises." And in the nature of the thing, there can be no diligence
   where there is no hope; where there is much of hope, there will be much
   of diligence. There is no reason that either should languish: there is
   the greatest reason why both should be lively and vigorous, and make
   each other so, even upon the supposition of what lies in the mind and
   purpose of God, in reference to the affairs of souls. And then, I
   further add by way of caution,

   8. That we do not overlook the advantages that may be made of
   agreements among them that do controvert this same thing. That is, the
   purposes and counsels of God touching the salvation of men, or touching
   the punishment of them who shall be found the tit subjects of his
   punitive justice in another state. Let us not overlook the advantage
   that may be made of what is in this matter agreed on all hands; that
   is, it is on all hands agreed, that no good man shall ever perish. This
   is a thing wherein all do consent and agree. And truly, what there is
   of difference, it is so very notional and little, in comparison of
   this, that here we have what should quiet our minds, yea, and it is
   further agreed, that for them that are wicked, they have always still
   means for making them better, more than ever they improve or make use
   of; and that God doth afford no such means to any unwillingly;
   therefore, always according to his will, and the counsel of his will;
   and consequently, that this must be found the case at last, that none
   do finally perish but such as have refused and rejected the overtures,
   or misimproved, or not improved the means that they had in order to
   their being saved. Though they had not all at once what was necessary
   to the saving of them, they had always reason to apprehend, that if
   they had used what they had, they should have had still more. And such
   agreements as these are by no means to be overlooked. We should labour
   to make the greatest advantage of them that the matter admits of. Yea,
   and it is further agreed, that this world is very wicked; and it cannot
   but be agreed, that God could make it generally better if he would, and
   therefore, it ought to be as generally agreed, that he hath something
   in his wise counsel whence it doth appear to him less fit to exert his
   almightiness to this purpose. Or, if any should expect he should do so,
   or wonder he doth not so, they have as much reason to wonder why he did
   not, by almightiness, shut sin out of the world at first, and why he
   did not, by his almighty power, (as he might,) prevent the apostasy or
   fall, either of the an gels that fell, or of the universality of men
   that fell all at once, and are all in a fallen state ever since.

   I shall not further insist as to matter of useful caution which in
   these several particulars hath been given you. But I shall add to
   these, some alleviating considerations, that may help to make things
   sit more easily on our minds, relating to this great and important
   subject. As,

   I Consider this, that all the purposes or determinations of the divine
   will, they are the products of counsel. That the text assures us, that
   whatsoever he doth, he doth according to the counsel of his own will,
   whereupon, as to the secret purposes and determinations of the divine
   will which therefore we know not, because they are secret, we have all
   the reason imaginable to think, that they must be most unexceptionable
   from that we do know, that they are all purposes guided by most
   unerring counsel, and which whilst we know not in particular what they
   are, we have nothing to do but reverentially to adore, as the apostle
   doth in Rom. xi. 33. "O! the depth both of the wisdom and knowledge of
   God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
   out." That part remains, to adore, with a dutiful adoration, what we do
   not distinctly and particularly understand, and, indeed, cannot
   understand. There is no government but hath its arcana; and it would be
   very inept and foolish for us to imagine, that there should be no
   secrets be longing to the divine government. But admit that there be,
   inasmuch as they do belong to the divine government, the government of
   God; that name is a name that comprehends all perfection, and excludes
   all imperfection; contains nothing in it but what is most excellent and
   perfect in all respects; and therefore, of this, in the general, we may
   rest most assured, that there can be nothing exceptionable in those
   purposes of his will which we do not particularly know. And,

   2. Let us but consider, that for his known and public counsels, they
   carry their own recommendableness in them to every mind, understanding
   and conscience of man, that shall consider. Do but bethink yourselves,
   what is given us as the summary of the whole counsel of God which is
   published and declared to apostate, fallen man. The apostle tells the
   Ephesians, (Acts xx. 21.) that he had made it his business to testify
   to them, "repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
   "And in having done so, he tells them (ver. 27.) that he had made known
   to them the whole counsel of God. Now, I beseech you, what could have
   been more suitable to the state of apostate, fallen creatures than to
   say, it is the counsel of God, they should repent, that they should
   turn to him. And since it was impossible they should return and be
   accepted, but upon the account of a Mediator and Redeemer who was to
   bring them to God, and reconcile them to him, what could be more
   suitable, than that this should be stood upon, wheresoever he is
   revealed and made known, that men should believe in him; that is,
   absolutely resign and subject themselves to his saving mercy, and to
   his governing power? Here is the whole counsel of God, here it is
   summed up. And what hath any man to say to this? why, being an apostate
   creature, lie should not turn and repent? and why, not being able to
   satisfy divine justice by himself, but having one revealed to him that
   hath fully done it, (so as to leave that none of his part) why he
   should not entrust his soul with him, and cast it upon him, and subject
   it to his conduct and government, by known and prescribed and most
   unexceptionable rules? And whereas, men cannot turn of themselves, (it
   is true,) they have not at present sufficient power in their own hand,
   it is all one, whether they have it, or may have it, if they do apply
   themselves. This is a part of the counsel of God too, that he is al
   ways ready to assist a returning soul: "Turn ye at my reproof, I will
   pour out my Spirit upon you." Prov. i. 21. This is part of his counsel:
   for they that do not so, are, in the next verse, said to have set at
   nought his counsel: "But they have set at nought my counsel and
   despised all my reproof." How unexceptionable are the counsels that are
   made known, and that are published and declared to us! And,

   3. Consider, that if this be the declared, published counsel of God,
   which you have heard, that he would have apostate creatures return, and
   is intent upon it that they should do so, "Turn ye, turn ye, why will
   ye die O house of Israel?" (Ezek. xviii.) and is always assisting to
   their return,--"turn ye at my reproof, apply yourselves, set about it,
   I will pour out my Spirit upon you, I will make known my words unto
   you:" I say, if this be his declared, published counsel, we are sure
   there can be no repugnant, contrary secret counsel. There can be no
   contrariety between his declared and his secret counsel. It were
   monstrous idolatry, that we should form in our own minds, instead of a
   Deity, an apprehension that he is made up of repugnancies and
   inconsistencies with himself. And again,

   4. Let us but consider, how things would lie under God's present view,
   supposing that we did not recur and run back into a foregoing eternity,
   supposing things to lie as they are in their present state, under the
   present and immediate view of God, only, without conceiving an eternal
   counsel and an eternal purpose concerning any such thing: and consider
   with yourselves how matters should lie then; that is, but thus, that
   whereas, God hath such an order of creatures, intelligent creatures,
   inhabiting this world, who have all apostatized, fallen, and gone off
   from him, and by the natural tendency of their course, are universally
   running themselves into misery, and sinking lower and lower, ready to
   be ingulfed of endless and eternal misery: he beholds these from the
   throne of his glory above; he sends forth plain, general significations
   of the pity and compassion he hath towards his creatures; directs his
   invitations to all the ends of the earth to look to him that they may
   be saved: if the express revelation do not reach all, it is they
   themselves, through their own wickedness, that do obstruct and hinder
   the diffusion of it, otherwise the gospel had spread and flown tike
   lightning from one quarter and end of the world to another, many an age
   ago, and still from age to age; but yet, plain significations that God
   is not irreconcileable to his fallen creatures, are more or less
   afforded every where; he doth not leave himself without witness in that
   he doth men good: he is kind to them; doth not treat them as an
   implacable God; makes his sun to shine, and his rain to fall upon the
   evil and the good, as in that context we so lately discoursed of to
   you. He is secretly striving with them, as his Spirit strove with the
   old world before the flood. "My Spirit (saith God) shall not always
   strive with man;" implying, that it had been striving, even with that
   wicked world before. And after the same rate he is dealing with men
   still. They despise the riches of his patience and goodness and
   long-suffering, many of them: suppose they do so more generally, he
   yet, by a merciful and more powerful hand takes hold of some, and saith
   (as it were) "Though you are inclined and disposed all to perish alike,
   I will have a relict from among you out of the hand and power of the
   destroyer:" and he hath finally a numerous remnant; more than any
   tongue can number, as we find the matter represented how it will be in
   the close and period of things; we do not know how vastly numerous they
   may yet be, or have been in former ages and successions of time. But
   they that perish, perish by their own wilful refusal of offered mercy,
   whether more expressly, or whether by more tacit, yet intelligible
   inclinations. Let but things be considered now as lying before God,
   obvious to one present view, Who hath any thing to say against God's
   method of procedure in this case? Who hath not cause to adore his grace
   and goodness and clemency in all this, though so great numbers finally
   perish? and then, how easy is the step further, if things to one
   present view do lie so very unexceptionably, what is there more of
   exception, supposing this view to have been eternal? If things be very
   fair thus, under one present view, will they lie worse, if it were a
   day earlier, or a month or a year earlier, or an age or from eternity?
   What is itself right and well, is eternally so, and was eternally so,
   and can never have been otherwise. And therefore, it is very vain and
   foolish for men to amuse their minds, and affright themselves with the
   thoughts of future and eternal counsels, that may have lain this way or
   that: if things look well to a present view, how can they look worse to
   an eternal one. And again, consider,

   5. That things should lie thus open to the eternal view of God, all at
   once, in all their dependencies and connections and references to one
   another, certainly, it is owing only to his perfections, that they
   should do so, and that they do so. Is it not a greater perfection to
   foresee and to foreknow all things, and to have forelaid all one's
   designs, than to foreknow nothing before hand? and to do nothing
   without foregoing, previous design? How unreasonable is it for us to
   think the worse of God for that he is more perfect! It is very
   unreasonable to suppose that he should not foreknow what will become of
   you and me in our eternal state; that he should not foreknow what the
   condition of that creature he hath made shall be to eternity. And
   whatsoever he doth actually make it to be, in point of felicity, by his
   own grace, or whatsoever he lets it be, in point of misery, by its own
   demerit, and the depraved inclination of its own nature, it is
   certainly his perfection to know the one and the other; and to do
   whatsoever he doth, willingly and with design, not unwillingly, or as
   if he could be imposed upon, or forced in any thing. Do but seriously
   consider how unreasonable it is to think the worse, or have the blacker
   thoughts of God, for that which is nothing else but his perfection. It
   would certainly be an imperfection to be nescient, and not to know what
   will become of things, and what will become of men: and so, to act
   incogitantly and without previous design, were a great imperfection. Is
   he then less fit to govern us, and to dispose of us and his creatures,
   for his being more perfect? And again,

   6. Consider how things will lie in the judgment of the great day. We
   know the rule of his final procedure in that day, which is called "the
   day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God," that he will
   give "eternal life to them that by patient continuance in well-doing
   seek for honour and glory and immortality: and indignation and wrath,
   tribulation and anguish to those that obey not the truth, but obey
   unrighteousness." Rom. ii. 5, 6. To none but perverse and persevering
   evil doers, none but such as refused to obey the truth and were
   contentious against it, and did obey unrighteousness, did give
   themselves up to the judgment of an unrighteous spirit and principle,
   ruling and working in them, to none else but these, "indignation and
   wrath, tribulation and anguish." If things will be very unexceptionable
   in the judgment of the great day, (as who can have any thing to say
   against this rule or this method of procedure) he will then, in the
   judgment of the great day, both do as he purposed before; and his
   purpose will no way be found to have differed from the measure of his
   final procedure. And again consider,

   7. That there cannot but a conviction go with the final issue of
   things, in the very souls and consciences of them that perish. They do
   foreknow the righteous judgment of God, that they that do such and such
   things are worthy of death; are worthy of misery. Pagans themselves do
   so, for to them the apostle speaks and refers in that: Romans, in the
   close of the chapter. And what convictions will be upon the consciences
   of men in the final issue of things, is sufficiently intimated in that,
   their principal sting is plainly enough and sufficiently intimated to
   be from their own consciences. There is the worm that never dies. And
   it were impossible this hold could be taken on the consciences of men,
   if it did not appear to them that they were finally guilty of their own
   ruin. All such imaginations must vanish and fly away of course, that it
   was impossible things should ever be otherwise with them than they are;
   that they were doomed unavoidably into that state into which they are
   come. Whatsoever might be a fence to keep off the stroke from their
   consciences, you must be sure will all vanish and be gone, and
   therefore, can have no place. And then lastly,

   8. Consider the high and everlasting approbation that all God's methods
   will have with the most clarified, refined minds of angels and saints,
   in all that vast general assembly made up of "the innumerable company
   of angels and the spirits of just men made perfect;" all agreeing in
   admiring and applauding the most unexceptionable righteousness of all
   God's dispensations; whereof the counsel of his will were the measure:
   "Just and true are thy ways, marvellous are thy works Lord God
   Almighty." And here will be no dark mind, no clouded understanding, no
   erroneous thought, no vitiating prejudice. If therefore, we are sure
   all things will to eternity lie well and right to the most perfect
   minds and understandings, then they are righteous in themselves: and
   being in themselves right, they ought to be so estimated and judged of
   by us. Certainly, these things cannot be mistaken, cannot be
   misunderstood and misapprehended by those pure and glorious creatures
   in the other state; those bright and unclouded minds that will see
   nothing but loveliness and beauty, and what is most highly praiseworthy
   and admirable in the eternal view that they shall have of them.
   Therefore, to shut up all for the present, let me but leave these two
   words of direction.

   (1.) Labour to cherish the love of God in your souls. That will commend
   to you all his counsels and all his methods. Love will never think
   amiss. And,

   (2.) Form your apprehensions concerning him, agreeably, that so you may
   have nothing in your minds to damp your love; nothing may disaffect you
   unto him. The understanding and the will (such is the constitution of
   the human nature) do interchangeably work upon one another: the more we
   love God, the better we shall think of him, and the better we think of
   him, the better we shall love him. These things circulate between one
   another. And nothing can be of higher and greater consequence: for if
   we do otherwise we shall cramp religion in ourselves; and so far as we
   propagate the ill sentiment, we shall hinder the, propagating and
   diffusing of religion among others. And do but take this deeply to
   heart, (perhaps I may have more reason to speak to it hereafter,) that
   in the latter days wherein, it is said, religion must flourish in the
   world, (Hosea iii. 5.) men are to "fear the Lord and his goodness."
   Most certain it is, in those days, (if there are such days yet to come
   better than we have seen,) thus it must be, there must be a universal
   diffusion of good thoughts concerning God. This is that knowledge of
   God that must replenish the world, and fill the earth, and transform
   the minds of men, and overcome their fierce, savage humours and
   dispositions, their disaffection towards God, and their barbarities
   towards one another; make them "beat their swords into ploughshares and
   their spears into pruning hooks." The revealed and acknowledged will of
   God, and goodness of God prevailing against the evil of the mind and
   hearts of men. "They shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter
   days." Their thoughts and apprehensions of God will be so persuasive to
   their own hearts, and they will look upon him according to that kind
   and amiable and lovely representation of himself that shall captivate
   all minds and hearts; and make men hate nothing but themselves, and
   that they have not sooner and more loved God.

LECTURE V. [19]

   Thus we have fully spoken to these words as they concern the spiritual
   and eternal state of men, which is the apostle's principal scope as you
   may see, in the foregoing part of the chapter, and of the same verse;
   "having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
   himself, according to the good pleasure of his will." verse 5. And
   here, "ac cording to the purpose of him that worketh all things
   according to the counsel of his own will," But you see, that from that
   special consideration of the counsel or purpose of his own will, or the
   good pleasure thereof, the apostle makes a very easy, natural
   transition unto this more general proposition which comprehends all
   that could be said, including the former in it, and much more. And
   therefore, having spoken to the more limited object already, of the
   counsel of the divine will, I shall proceed to speak somewhat of the
   counsel of God's will concerning the other affairs of men, besides
   those of their souls or of their eternal state.

   And though it be very true that God's agency about all these outward
   concernments of men, do belong to another head of theology, that is,
   his providence; yet, the counsel of his will, according whereunto that
   agency is directed about these affairs, as well as those others that we
   have already spoken to, comes properly under our consideration here.
   And therefore, to that I shall speak somewhat briefly; to wit, the
   counsel of the divine will respecting the present concernments of men
   in the world, so far as it may be needful and useful to us; that so we
   may detract nothing from God, that doth truly and right fully belong to
   him, and that we may not lose the advantage of the pleasant sentiments
   and relishes which we may have ourselves, and in our own spirits from
   the right stating of this matter, which we shall, therefore, endeavour
   as much as in us is. And shall in speaking of it do these four
   things--speak of the extent of the object about which the counsel of
   the divine will is said to be conversant--of the counsel of the divine
   will itself, its nature and significancy in reference to that object or
   sort of objects that we are now to consider--give you briefly the
   reasons why we are to ascribe such a thing to God as counsel and
   purpose touching these affairs of ours, and--labour to shew you, that
   no ill consequence can reasonably and justly, be drawn from hence.

   I. The extent of the object: sure we are not otherwise to circumscribe
   it than the letter of the text; WHO WORKETH ALL THINGS. For that
   special sort of object, the souls of men, and their spiritual and
   eternal state, we have spoken to already, which falls within the
   compass and comprehension, you plainly enough see, in the general
   expression in the text. And having spoken to that, even all other
   concernments besides we must understand to be within the compass of the
   object too: and therefore, that the counsel of the divine will is
   conversant about them; that is, whatsoever be hath any agency about,
   about that also, the counsel of his will hath place, for "he worketh
   all things according to the counsel of his will." He doth nothing
   unwillingly, he wills nothing unadvisedly: therefore, whereas all
   things lie under his agency, all things lie under the counsel of his
   will.

   More especially, whatsoever he hath made any law about; in reference to
   whatsoever he hath given us rules and precepts, these are called
   counsels often, and often in Scripture: they are the counsels and
   mandates of his will. These all lie under the counsel of his will.

   There is no state or condition that men can be in, in this world, but
   there are regulations and precepts given in reference thereto.
   Whatsoever is matter of threatening or of promise, the sanctions
   annexed to his precepts, (as there are many things of threatening and
   promise that are of temporal concernments,) these still must be
   considered as being within the same compass. Whatsoever may be matter
   of affliction or of comfort, whatsoever may have in it any thing of
   blessing, or any thing of cursing, (as there are temporal blessings and
   temporal curses besides the eternal ones,) all these, we must
   understand to be consulted of, in the sense we formerly opened unto
   you, excluding all the imperfections, and including all the perfection
   that can be any way conceived or signified by it.

   Moreover, all the private concernments of men, personal and domestic;
   the concernments of the world, of kingdoms and nations, political
   concernments: the concernments of the church of God in the world, which
   may be considered under the measure of time; they are all to be
   considered within the object of divine purpose and counsel.

   The more private, personal or domestic concernments of men; they belong
   to this object, and cannot be excluded. The time of every one's coming
   into this world, and the time of his going out of it: the "time to be
   born, and the time to die;" they lie under the determination of the
   divine counsel, directive of his will: even touching them, there is a
   time for every purpose under the sun. These, among the rest, "a time to
   be born and a time to die." Eccles. iii. 2. Skipping over (as it were)
   the intervening time, as if that were little worth the notice: yet only
   not noting it there, but in the mean time not excluding it neither, as
   is evincible enough from many other texts. But it is to be observed,
   (if you compare that with another passage in the same book: chap. 8.
   6.) as to every purpose, there belongs a season, so to every season
   there belongs judgment; to every purpose there is time and judgment.
   That must, undoubtedly, primarily, mean divine judgment, which is the
   perfection of counsel; that which with men is the result of counsel,
   and which therefore, must signify somewhat analogous with God: there is
   the judgment of wisdom and counsel, that is determinative of every
   season, every time, for whatsoever purpose, or occurrence that falls
   out to any of the sons of men. And the time between these two times,
   the time of their being born, and the time when they are to die: that
   lies tinder the same determination. His days and months and years are
   all set and appointed; as it is fully expressed in Job xiv. 6.

   And so the conditions of men, while they are here in this world,
   whether they shall be high or low; whether they shall be rich or poor;
   every one hath his dimension, his allowance ordered for him; and no
   doubt therefore, pre-ordained. Whatsoever portion any man hath of the
   things of this life, whether it be more, or whether it be less, it is
   all given. Even what the ravens have, the fowls of the air and the
   beasts of the field, it is all given: and much more what every man
   hath, is by the divine allowance and vouchsafement. To every living
   thing he gives what is convenient and suitable for the sup port of that
   life which he had given it before. But what he gives, he gives
   willingly, not against his will. And what he did once will, (as you
   formerly heard,) he could not but ever will, and there can be no new
   one with him.

   And how particular persons do branch into families; this all lies under
   the particular direction even of divine counsel an*d purpose. And so,
   what allotments such and such families shall have; and those as they
   multiply and do increase, "even unto nations and kingdoms," as you see,
   Acts xvii. 26. As God hath made of one blood all nations of men to
   dwell on all the face of the earth; so he hath determined the times of
   all, and appointed the very bounds of their habitations; assigned to
   every one his place where he shall be. It hath been the matter of the
   counsel of the divine will, even concerning us, that our lot should
   fall in such and such a part of the world: that we should dwell so much
   of our time in such a place; that our lot should be cast in England, or
   for so long a time in Lon don; and in what circumstances and with what
   advantages one way or other. All these things, as they have been
   ordered by the great Lord of all, so they are not ordered by him
   incogitantly, but according to the eternal counsel and purpose that are
   understood to have passed concerning us. The very meanest things that
   can any way belong to us, or belong to this world, being expressly
   mentioned to come under the divine cognizance and care; it is plain
   such concernments as these cannot be excluded. As when we are told, all
   the hairs of our heads are numbered; and that a sparrow cannot fall to
   the ground without our heavenly Father. And that is our Saviour's
   reasoning from hence, "Are not ye of more value than they, than many
   sparrows?" Now, if these things be the matter of the very care and
   agency of providence, they must have been the matter of an eternal
   purpose and counsel, for the reason again and again repeated before,
   that nothing can be new with God; no new thought, no new counsel or
   purpose.

   And to consider, to what particularities the divine eye and purpose do
   reach; what we find recorded and comes under our notice by way of
   history, that therefore, must suppose there hath been an eternal view,
   even of the same things, and a purpose concerning them. As for
   instance, that which appears to be the most barren part of the Bible,
   that large account that we have of genealogy in Scripture; How should
   Moses possibly come to know through the successions of so many hundreds
   of years, even two thousand years before him, what children such and
   such men had, all those that are reckoned up, and how many years they
   lived? And it was thought fit that should be put down: and how such
   families were ranked, and what nations sprang from them; all these must
   needs have been matter of divine Revelation, and therefore, were matter
   of divine knowledge, and therefore, were eternally so: all things being
   in the same order, under the divine eye, wherein they actually come to
   pass in the world.

   So all the removes of men to and fro, here upon earth. "Thou tellest my
   wanderings," saith David; there is not a step taken this way or that,
   but all is under the divine direction and provision and purpose, that
   so and so it shall be.

   And if you enlarge your thoughts further, to the concernments of formed
   nations and kingdoms, collective bodies, they must be understood also,
   to be within the compass of this object. The alterations in kingdoms;
   the seasons and intervals of rests and disturbances; of peace and of
   war, of plenty and of scarcity; of a prosperous and of an adverse
   posture of affairs, in respect of any, whatsoever, favourable
   providences or judgments that come upon these; these all lie under the
   counsel of the divine will. The revolutions of governments, when they
   are past, when they pass from form to form; God hath been pleased to
   give some more extraordinary proof and demonstration of his regency in
   these kingdoms, on purpose that it may be known (as Nebuchadnezzar,
   that great prince was forced to confess) that God rules over the
   kingdoms of men, and gives them to whom he pleaseth. Dan. iv. 32. The
   Most High rules in the kingdom of men. It is not said kingdoms,
   importing this whole world to be one kingdom to him, one great
   monarchy, all lying under his imperial power. And all this must be
   understood to be according to counsel, and according to purposes that
   were with him eternally. For (as hath been said before) his being is
   so; Et eternum non patitur novum; no new thing can fall out in
   eternity.

   And so, for the state of his church in general, or of particular
   churches upon earth; all their concernments, as they are such, they
   fall under the counsel of the divine will which orders all their
   circumstances in reference to them; sometimes making their condition
   more prosperous and favourable, and sometimes, move adverse, for trial
   and needful exercise of their graces, in these kinds wherein it is
   requisite such graces should have their exercises, which he hath
   adapted to such special purposes. So large (and for our thoughts, let
   them go as large, and far as they will or can) is the object about
   which the counsel of the divine will is conversant. But,

   2. Something is to be said concerning the nature of such counsel and
   will, as it respects such an object; or this more special sort of
   object which I most intend in the present discourse. Why,

   ( I.) This is always to be held concerning the counsel of the divine
   will, that it is most perfectly wise; all things being in view to him
   at once, open to one eternal view in all their connections, references
   and dependancies; he having a thorough and everlasting perspection,
   even of all at once, of the things themselves and of their connection
   with one another, even as they are connected, not because they are so,
   so as to pass from one connected thing to another, as we in our more
   imperfect way of knowing things are constrained to do. And,

   (2.) The counsel of his will must therefore, hereupon, be immutable:
   being most perfectly wise, there can be no imaginable? reason of any
   change. He never needs alter his measures: "Known to him are all his
   works from the beginning of the world," was that grave saying of the
   apostle James, in that synod at Jerusalem. Acts xv. 18. Whatsoever he
   hath to do, or doth do, that he designed to do; for he acts nothing
   casually: and what he did design to do, he did consult about, so far as
   consulting can have place with him: we explained the sense of it
   before, that is, that he hath perfect perspection of all that is
   requisite and fit to be done, and so did purpose according thereto, and
   then doth according to that purpose. And therefore, to consider,
   besides the nature of such a divine purpose and counsel, its reference
   and significancy to human affairs. I say,

   (3.) This same counsel of the divine will, it is a measure to himself
   of all his own agency, what he will do, and what he will not do; how
   far he will exert his influence, and wherein he will suspend it: how he
   will direct it this way and that, and how he will limit it. And,

   (4.) By consequence, it must needs be a measure of all events; because
   nothing can eventually fallout, but according to his will, either
   effecting or permitting; and there being no determination of his will
   which is not still under the direction of divine counsel. And all this,
   we must understand to be constantly transacting with him, with the
   greatest clearness, and with the greatest facility imaginable. You do
   observe among men, vastly different tempers and complexions of mind;
   some seem to be almost constantly calm and sedate, composed and serene,
   there appears nothing torpid or unequal in their frame or habit. Now,
   if we can conceive among human minds what is more perfect, and what is
   less, sure it should not be difficult to us to take our assent, and
   conceive concerning the Divine Mind, that it must be most absolutely
   perfect, never liable to any cloud, to any discomposure, all things
   lying in a most perfect clearness, and having their eternal formation
   or form there, with the greatest imaginable facility: and infinitely
   more than we can imagine. So as there is no cause for any thought
   concerning a plenus negotii Deus, as the epicurean objecteth,
   concerning such a Deity as should be engaged and taken up about making,
   and about governing such a world as this, that this must give too much
   business to such a Being, as we are not to conceive of otherwise than
   as perfectly happy, it not consisting (as they foolishly imagine) with
   the felicity and happiness of such a Being. But when we can conceive in
   some men, with how very great composure of mind they go through a great
   variety of business, their minds being always clear and serene, can we
   not consider concerning God, that his understanding is infinite, as
   reason and Scripture do most plainly speak; and so that nothing could
   ever be excluded it, or lie without it? as the various images of things
   are represented in a clear glass, detected there, without giving any
   toil or labour to the glass, or inferring upon it any change. And so
   the schools have been wont to speak of God's eternal knowledge of
   things, that he beholds them all as in an everlasting and eternal
   speculum, there being that perpetual and eternal clearness in the
   Divine Mind, that things lie there without any discomposure to him,
   without any disorder, in the same state and frame, wherein they do
   actually fall out; so as when they do actually fall out, whatsoever
   disturbance there is of one thing with another, and among the things
   themselves variously interfering, yet all these things are beheld
   without disturbance to him: as the various motions and agitations of
   many persons in a room, all represented in a clear glass, make no
   disturbance or discomposure in it at all, whatsoever there is in the
   things represented. Therefore, I pass,

   3. To the reasons why we are to ascribe to God such a concern about
   human affairs, so as to employ the counsel of 1m will, even from
   eternity about them. I will shortly name to you these two plain and
   obvious things, as the reasons thereof, besides what Scripture doth, in
   many more places than those that I have named, expressly assert about
   it: 1st. The most absolute perfection of hiss nature cannot but infer
   it: and 2d. the supremacy, the universality and accurateness of his
   government.

   (1.) The perfection of his nature, that cannot but infer it. He being
   every way perfect, absolutely perfect, (which he must be, if he be God,
   we have no other notion of a Deity but of a being absolutely and
   universally perfect,) he must be omniscient, and must know all things:
   and if so, he must always have known them; for if ever he did not know
   them, there will be some addition to his knowledge when he comes to do
   so. But that knowledge to which there can be an addition is imperfect;
   and therefore, the divine knowledge could never admit of any addition,
   but all things, (as was said before) must have lain open everlastingly
   with him to one eternal view. And,

   (2.) The supremacy, universality, and exactness of his government, doth
   necessarily infer it. Inasmuch as he is Lord over all, and is Most
   High, there can be none above him that should be director of such
   affairs. And inasmuch as he is universal Governor, if any affairs lie
   not under his government, they can lie under none. It is not a
   supposable thing, that one part of the creation should be governed, and
   another ungoverned; part under a ruler and the other part under no rule
   at all. And then, the exactness of his government, not considered
   absolutely, but respectively, that is, with respect to the state of the
   governed creatures, the governed communities that lie under the
   management and dominion of his kingdom. We are to consider this world
   as in a state of apostasy; and we are not to expect that he should deal
   with this world, as if men were in a perfect state, for their frame and
   temper are far from perfect. He deals with them as suitable to the
   state of apostates, as those that have been, and are, in rebellion
   against him gene rally. And admirable it is that the methods of his
   government should be so mild and propitious; and that so much of common
   order should be preserved among them thereby, as we find there is, this
   being considered. But to such government, eternal provision and purpose
   are always necessary, and could not but be necessary. There must be
   eternal foresight of all that was to be done, and eternal purpose and
   counsel thereupon. We thence come,

   4. To consider, that there can be nothing of ill consequence, justly
   and reasonably, drawn from hence. What is most supposable in this case,
   and of this kind, that is, which may present itself to a first view
   under the notion of an ill, or inconvenient consequence, which chiefly
   lies under one of these two heads, 1st. That this hypothesis will
   preclude the use of human prudence; and 2d. that it will shut out
   prayer. These are two things that carry a first and more obvious
   appearance of an ill consequence, upon the supposition of what we have
   been hitherto asserting. But I shall labour to evince, that neither of
   these consequences can, with any reasonable colour, be thought to
   ensue. As,

   (1.) That here, there should be no place nor use for human prudence.
   Thus some may too hastily think and pronounce, If there be a divine
   counsel and purpose about every thing that a man can do, or about every
   thing that shall occur to him, that he may either enjoy or suffer, to
   what purpose is it for men to consult and determine, or contrive this
   way or that? as not knowing but that they may, in the very thing they
   design and go about, run counter to the counsels of the divine will;
   and so all will be in vain, and to no purpose. We shall give you some
   considerations to shew the m-consequence, that it follows not, that
   there is no pretence that the use of human prudence should hereby be
   excluded. As,

   [1.] That all things are determined by God to fall out in the way
   wherein they do fall out. I told you at first, when I entered upon this
   subject, we are not to conceive any such thing concerning him, as that
   he doth decree and determine things abstractly, without reference to
   the media by which they are to be brought about. We are to impute no
   such thing to God, with reference to the eternal states of men, as we
   spake then; that whatsoever a man doth he shall be damned, be he never
   so good, never so strict, never so pious; or that whatsoever such a man
   doth, he shall be saved, let him be never so wicked, never so
   irreligious or profane; never so strongly persist and persevere in such
   a course. We are to impute no such thing, no such counsel to the wise
   and holy God. Neither his word, nor the reason of the thing leads us to
   any such thought concerning him. And so, in reference to these lower
   affairs, we are never to think any such thing concerning him, as if he
   laid down purposes and decrees concerning this or that end, without
   connecting in his own eternal mind and view, the whole scheme of all
   the ways and methods and means by which such ends are to be compassed
   and brought about. And therefore,

   [2.] Those things which, according to the counsel of his will, are to
   be brought about by the intervention and exercise of human prudence;
   these things are actually so brought about: whatsoever is effected,
   whatsoever is done by the exercise of the prudence of a man, it lay in
   the divine mind and counsel, as a thing not only to be brought about,
   but to be brought about so, and in that way, by that very means, by the
   deliberation, and by the prudent contrivances of such and such of his
   creatures, that should serve his purpose in such a way. And therefore,

   [3.] In this case, and in reference to all such events, the very
   objection is an argument. The objection, the possible use, or
   advantageous use, of human prudence is a proof and demonstration of it:
   for, according to divine counsel and purpose, such a thing as doth
   actually occur and come to pass by human prudence, was determined so to
   come to pass, by the intervention of human prudence. And again,

   [4.] It is the much more common course, in the way of God's
   dispensation towards his creatures, to let things go on according to
   the posture and aptitude of the second causes by which they are
   effected and brought about; it is much the more common and usual
   course. He who is the supreme Ruler and Lord of all, is not to be
   supposed but he may at pleasure lay on a restrictive or regulating
   hand, as he sees meet to alter the natural course and tendency of
   things. But ordinarily he doth not so, but things do run on according
   to the aptitude and disposition and posture of the second causes, by
   the ministry whereof they are effected and brought about. And even as
   to voluntary and rational agents, whereas, the men of this world, (who
   are such agents,) are generally wicked, God generally, and for the most
   part, doth not hinder the ill purposes that they have formed and
   contrived and set themselves to execute. That, the Psalm ist supposeth
   to be the common case when, in that psal. xxxvii. 7. he gives so
   weighty counsel in reference to that case, not fretting, nor letting
   our hearts tumultuate and arise and swell within us, because of evil
   men that bring their wicked devices to pass, implying this to be the
   more ordinary case, that wicked men do bring their wicked devices to
   pass, God doth not lay that restraint, for great and holy ends and
   reasons, which will appear in their lustre and glory one day; but lets
   things run on in their own course according as the inclinations and
   aptitudes of other second causes do lead. And this being observably so,
   it is the most unreasonable thing in the world, to suppose that in
   rarer instances wherein the purposes of men are disappointed and
   frustrated by some signal hand from God, therefore the natural
   operations that do belong to men should be concluded to be generally or
   universally useless, or to be precluded: or that the principles were
   useless which were suited to such operations or ends as those. But,

   [5.] We are further to consider, that if God doth more extraordinarily
   interpose, so as to disappoint the evil purposes of men, contrived by
   their subtilty and craft, (which they are apt enough themselves to
   misname prudence,) he doth it in no such way as offers violence to the
   rational nature. He doth it by letting men befool themselves, or by
   letting them befool one another, or sometimes by letting the devil
   befool them, He sometimes lets one man befool another: as when that
   counsel of Hushai, proved to be the means by which God turned (as David
   prayed he would,) Ahitophel's counsel into foolishness. Sometimes, he
   lets the devil befool men, acting according to his own inclinations
   which he restrains not. He lets him loose as he did to deceive Ahab,
   being a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets, unto Ahab's
   destruction. He would not, himself, infuse a lie into the mind of Ahab,
   (which was a thing his nature was most abhorrent from, being the God of
   truth,) neither would he let a good angel go and tell a lie to him, as
   unbeseeming and, indeed, impossible to one that had the divine image in
   perfection in his nature. But there being a proneness in the wicked
   spirit (as the matter is parabolically and dramatically represented) to
   go and deceive Ahab, in his prophets, to his destruction, he lets him
   go. But there is no violence offered to the rational nature of man in
   all this. He acts by judgment, (such as it is) that is, by a mistaken
   judgment; not by none, or against judgment, against a practical
   judgment, which indeed to the nature of man were impossible. And those
   that are under such deceptions as these, when they do indeed play the
   fool: as Ahitophel's counsel was turned into foolishness and they all
   became fools that followed it, yet they thought themselves wise in so
   doing: and so, those that were reckoned or did reckon themselves wise,
   were taken in their own craftiness, and their counsels driven headlong,
   as in Job v. 13. the expression is. And what they do in such kinds,
   under such deception, they do freely and with complacency, pleasing
   themselves in their own way; so as there is no violence offered to the
   nature of man, considering him as a rational, and as a voluntary agent
   in what he doth, even then, when hi& purposes are inverted and
   disappointed. But then,

   [6.] If men do take up such purposes as it seems meet to. the great and
   holy God to frustrate and disappoint, (which by extraordinary
   interposition, as hath been said, he doth very rarely: be is sparing in
   instances of that kind,) yet, that, men are to blame themselves for;
   either, that they did propose to themselves unlawful designs; or, that
   they did pursue and prosecute lawful ones unlawfully; whence it hath
   seemed meet to that wisdom which governs the world, either to cross and
   defeat their designs, or to check and rebuke them, that they may
   reflect on and understand their own folly in so mishaping in their own
   course, as they "are often wont to do when they take up wicked
   purposes, and form wicked designs which prove abortive. And how should
   it be otherwise, if they take counsel against the Lord and his anointed
   one, his Christ? Do you think it strange that that should be, in vain?
   t( Wherefore doth the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain
   thing?" Why is it a vain thing that they imagine and device? It is
   counsel against the Lord and his Messiah. And if there be an inverture
   of the counsel and purposes of men which do lie cross to the divine
   counsel and purpose, and that they clash with one another, what wonder
   is that? Nay, whose will is it fit should rule and oversway in such a
   case? Is God to quit the sovereignty and yield up his throne and
   sceptre, and say unto vain creatures, "Be it according to your mind,
   and according to your will," when they will nothing but mischief, wrong
   to him, and ruin to all that are better than themselves? And some
   times, they pursue the most lawful things unlawfully: and then it is
   meet that God should someway or other give a check to them. As in such
   an instance as the apostle James mentioneth, (chap. iv. 13.) of such as
   say, in the power of their own self-conceit and self-will and
   self-confidence, "We will go to such and such a city, and will tarry
   there a year, and we will buy and sell and get gain:" and forget all
   this while that they live under the divine dominion and government;
   that they ought to say, "If the Lord will, we will do so and so." It is
   very fit, that in such cases, God should put them in mind they have a
   Lord over them, and that he should give a check to such insolencies.
   And if they meet with rebukes because they will not carry themselves
   like those that live under the dominion and government of a Ruler who
   is superior to them, they will not walk in that light which before hath
   been made to shine in their minds and consciences, and God takes a
   severe method with them, to make them know themselves and him; there is
   nothing unfit done in the case. He doth but what he owes to himself to
   do, that he may do himself right, that he may not lose the honour and
   acknowledgment that are due to him, as he is Lord of all. But now, upon
   such a supposition as this, it is no more reasonable to say, that the
   understanding, or reason, or wisdom, or prudence which any man hath, is
   given him in vain, than it would be to say, that because such and such
   a man is a very prudent, wise man, it is altogether in vain that he
   should have a prudent servant. And yet, there is no man so wise, but if
   he have occasion for a servant, he will have an understanding man to be
   his servant, and not a fool; a prudent one, and not one that is rash
   and foolish, and would do things precipitately and to disadvantage. But
   how unreasonable would it be to say, that because such a wise master
   will not let even this wise servant do his business his own way, but
   will check and control him and exercise the authority of a master over
   him, therefore, such a man hath a prudent servant in vain? Who would be
   so foolish as to say, the prudence of such a servant is to no purpose
   unless he may be master, and carry every thing his own way, according
   to his own mind and fancy? Or suppose a man had a watch that ordinarily
   goes well as he would have it, but sometimes he finds it to err, and
   then he rectifies it with his finger; would the owner of this watch,
   taking upon him to rectify it with his finger, say, "To what purpose
   are all the contrivances of this watch, and to what purpose are the
   several wheels and movements in it, if a man shall move it with his
   finger?" There is as little reason to pretend, that prudence and wisdom
   are given to any man in vain, because God will over rule him and shew
   himself to be supreme in sundry such instances as may occur. I say,
   there is as little reason to say and allege this, as there would be to
   say, that all the articles in a watch are in vain, because it may need
   sometimes to be rectified and corrected by a wise finger.

LECTURE VI. [20]

   I shall only add to all that hath been said on this head, that the
   counsels of the divine will do very well admit of the use of human
   prudence, in subordination thereto, and it hath its great significancy
   in such subordination, but in opposition thereunto, it can signify
   nothing. And nobody is to think this strange, in subordination to the
   counsels of the divine will. Human prudence signifies much, all that it
   is covetable that it should signify. Many times God designs to bring
   about such and such events by the ministry of human prudence, and then
   the counsel of the divine will is so far from excluding it, that it
   doth necessarily include it, and take it in; cannot but do so. But most
   plain it is, that human prudence can signify nothing in opposition to
   the divine will. And would you have it? would any one wish it should?
   That human prudence should take place against the divine will, is that
   a thing to be wished? Or are we to be fond of human prudence in
   opposition to the divine counsel, as if we thought the world would be
   better governed by men than by God? That, sure, is never to be
   regretted, that there is no wisdom, no counsel, no understanding
   against the Lord. Sure, that should trouble none of us, but please all.
   And to think, hereupon, that human prudence must needs be a useless
   thing, because God doth not put all into the hands of men, and leave
   them to do in the world, whatsoever they please as so many ungoverned
   creatures, (as was formerly hinted,) it might as well be said, To what
   purpose is it for a man to have a prudent servant, unless the servant's
   will and pleasure may take place in every thing against his master's.

   (2 ) But I come in the second place to that other supposed ill
   consequence, to wit, that the assertion of such a counsel of the divine
   will, must exclude the great duty of prayer. And I think it is very
   material and of great importance to discourse to you somewhat largely
   upon this head; because, I know how commonly it lies in the minds of
   many men, as an objection against that great duty; or else, they make
   use of the objection of that great duty, as an objection against the
   divine counsel and purpose, and the hand which they are to have in all
   human affairs. Now, that this seeming difficulty may be cleared, I will
   give you sundry considerations. As,

   [1.] That the primary or more principal notion that we are to have of
   prayer, is to conceive of it as an act of worship, that is, as an
   homage due and claimed to be paid to the great sovereign Lord of all.
   That is the principal and prime notion that we are to have of prayer;
   that is, that it is such an act of duty as wherein we are to own and
   acknowledge God: it is due to him, as he is God, to be supplicated,
   sought to: that there be a dependance upon him, professed and avowed by
   his reasonable creatures. Now this being the first and primary notion
   of prayer, an acknowledging of God, and avowing our dependance upon
   him, and of his superiority over us, as that adjunct expression of it,
   bowing the knee before him, doth import, I would fain know whether he
   be the less adorable, for that he is infinitely wise? And if he be
   infinitely wise, then his wisdom and counsel must extend to all things.
   But doth his infinite wisdom render him a less adorable Object? Doth he
   less deserve to be worshipped, or have his due homage paid him by his
   creatures, for that he is infinitely wise? The counsel of his own will
   extending to all things doth import so much; he is wise without limit,
   so as that the exercise of his wisdom can not he excluded or shut out
   in any case. If it could be excluded in any case, it were not infinite:
   but because it is infinite, is it therefore, a less excellency for
   being infinite? And so, Doth he less deserve to be adored and honoured,
   and to have homage paid unto him as such? And,

   [2.] Whereas, when we do pray, we do also express inclinations and
   desires of our own, that we would have this or that brought about, when
   we foreknow the event to be determined by the divine will: prayer is so
   far from being excluded by that, that we pray with so much the more
   vigour and cheerfulness and alacrity; and our hearts and souls are so
   much the more enlarged and engaged and drawn forth in prayer, even when
   we know the things we pray about are determined by the counsel of the
   divine will. As in that memorable case of Daniel's foreknowing by
   books, by Jeremiah's prophecies, that the approaching period and end of
   the seventy years, determined for the continued captivity of his
   people; when he under stood this book, and discerned the approach of
   the time, he sets himself with so much the more vigour to pray: (as you
   see Daniel ix. 1, 2.) finding out that the matter was near, and towards
   a period, he doth not therefore think prayer excluded, but sets himself
   to pray with so much the more earnestness and vigour hereupon. As,
   indeed, if any do consider the nature of man's constitution, and the
   frame of the human soul, it is evident that desire and hope do
   influence one another. It is a mighty damp to all rational desire to
   have no hope. And if the thing be looked upon as desirable in itself;
   so much the more of hope, so much more of desire: and by how much the
   more hope doth rise towards confidence, desires grow so much the more
   fervent. As simple despair of any thing which we have an inclination to
   desire, damps desire; when we see that the thing is altogether to be
   despaired of, reason itself dictates to us to withdraw our minds, and
   turn them another way. Daniel understood the time drew on, when this
   sad calamitous state of his people was to find its period and be
   determined; then he sets himself with mighty vigour and fervour of
   spirit to prayer. And,

   [3.] When we do not foreknow the event, as not having any discovery
   made to us what the counsels of the divine will concerning it are, yet,
   even then, the business of prayer is to refer ourselves, with reference
   to any such concernments, to the divine disposal. A thing most suitable
   to him and to us; to him as he is the wise and sovereign Lord of all;
   and to us, as we are depending creatures, subject to his government,
   and are disposed of, in reference to all our concernments, or
   whatsoever we have any concern about, as he sees good. And therefore,

   [4.] In reference to such things, wherein we are ignorant of the event
   and what God will do, the proper design of prayer is, to endeavour to
   obtain at his hands a disposition of spirit complying with his
   pleasure, so as there may be no contest between him and us; that
   whenever the event falls out, if it do prove agreeable to our
   inclinations, we may rejoice in it with so much the more raised and
   sincere gratitude: if it do not, that we may submit to him, without
   engaging in a contest with one who giveth no account of any of his
   matters; and with whom, none can contend and prosper. They must always
   have the worst of it, they must be worsted in it if they engage in a
   contest with him. Therefore, the business we must design in such
   prayer, or in prayer about such things, (the issue whereof we do not
   foreknow,) is not to bring the divine will to ours, but to bring our
   will to his. As the matter is aptly enough illustrated by some, suppose
   one comes down a rapid stream in a boat, and hath the opportunity to
   throw an anchor or hook on the shore, there he pulls, as though he
   would draw the shore to the boat, and yet, all that he can be
   rationally supposed to in tend, is to draw the boat to the shore. So
   are we to design in prayer, that plucking ourselves unto God, the
   drawing of our souls to a compliance with him, that our wills may be
   brought to unite with his; not that we can imagine to change his will
   by any thing we can say, more than in the narrative of our prayer we do
   suppose to ourselves the informing him of any thing whereof we suppose
   him before ignorant. "He is of one mind, and who can turn him?" Job
   xxiii. 13. And therefore,

   [5.] The availableness of prayer, considered in reference to the
   counsels of the divine will, is to be estimated by the tenour of our
   prayers: according as our prayer is modelled, so it wilt be available
   or unavailable. This is the confidence we ought to have in prayer,
   "that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us." 1 John
   v. 14. And therefore, further,

   [6.] We must make it our great business, in all our ad dresses to him
   in prayer, and especially in reference to temporal concernments, (about
   which we have no express signification of his will, as we have about
   spiritual and eternal ones) to have our prayers so formed as that they
   may agree with the court of heaven, (as I may speak,) whither they are
   to be addressed. As if any man on earth, is to petition a human
   judicature, he must endeavour to know the stile and phrase of the
   court, and that his petition may he right in point of form; and
   especially so are we concerned to do in this case, when we are to
   address the great God. There must be a becomingness of God observed,
   that we address to him, as God is to be addressed to, and one that is
   absolutely supreme, and perfectly wise and good, who (according to that
   observable saying which I remember in the great Jew Philo, who gives us
   this notion of himself) hath given us that discovery, that we have
   always a ground of so fixed and formed an apprehension of him as one
   that can do all things, and will do that which is best. Such a
   conception of God, if our prayers do but carry with them a conformity
   to that conception, that is, that we have this fixed confidence
   concerning him, that he can do what he will, and that he will always do
   what is best, we can never think that such prayers can ever be
   unavailable. But this doth so highly agree with this apprehension that
   he doth all that he doth do, according to the counsel of his own will,
   that it not only is not prejudiced thereby, but we are greatly
   confirmed in it, that if he doth all things according to the counsel of
   his own will, he will never do any thing that is wrong, he will never
   do any thing that we ought to have so much as a wish, that it be
   otherwise than as he will do it: for as he can do whatsoever he will,
   so he will always do whatsoever is best. And,

   [7] Therefore, we ought to form our addresses and petitions to God,
   according as his word hath given us direction. As there are rules, some
   way or other, to be known in any prince's court, or in any court of
   judicature, how they are to be addressed to: some way or other, it is
   to be understood. And we may understand by his plain word, how he is to
   be addressed to. As to all those things that are of principal
   concernment and necessity to us, we find directions in his word to pray
   for such things, with promises they shall be granted upon serious and
   sincere prayer. We knew his will so far about our principal
   concernments, as that they who repent shall be for given, they who ask
   his Spirit shall have it, to them that improve what they have, he will
   give more, that if we set ourselves to work out our own salvation with
   fear and trembling, he will work in us to will and to do of his own
   good pleasure. About these, our greatest concernments, we are at a
   certainty. He hath told us in his most plain and express word, what he
   will always do in such cases. But we are always left uncertain about
   such things as are less considerable, and about things too, that are of
   a mutable goodness, that is, that are sometimes good and sometimes
   evil. The things of the mind are invariably good, always good; what is
   the goodness of the mind is always so. That the mind he knowing,
   intelligent; that it he holy, pure, subject unto God; these are things
   always good, invariably good. But it cannot be said so concerning the
   bona corporis, the good things of the body, or the bona fortunae, the
   good things of fortune, that they are always good, for their goodness
   is to be measured according to their suitableness and conformity or
   subserviency to some greater good. For we are to consider that as we
   have bodies so we have minds too; and that which would be good for my
   body, if hurtful to my mind, it loseth the nature of goodness; and
   therefore, is that goodness mutable, according as circumstances will
   render such and such things more and more subservient to a higher good,
   to a nobler kind of good that we are more to be concerned about. And
   therefore, for those things which are of a mutable goodness they cannot
   be the matter of an absolute promise, that shall be concluding and
   determinative concerning them universally, and at all times; because at
   sometimes that which would be a good, it may at another time degenerate
   into evil, by the variation of circumstances. But an evil cannot be the
   matter of a promise; it would be the matter of a threatening at such a
   time when it ceaseth to be good. If it should stand in the promise
   under the notion of a good, but by this and that circumstance loseth
   its aptitude and suitableness to the end wherein this goodness lies,
   then doth that good turn into an evil, and so cannot be the matter of a
   promise. You, cannot say, you promise anyone that which is evil, or
   which would be a hurt to him; therefore, the promises of God, in
   reference to things of this nature, are always suitable to the nature
   of the things. We have as express promises concerning temporal good
   things as the nature of the things will bear, or our circumstances
   admit, and therefore, God hath done more suitably to himself and us, in
   reference to such things, in telling us "all things shall work together
   for good to them that love God and that are the called according to his
   purpose." Rom. viii. 28. Indeed, a person that is a sincere lover of
   God, cannot but be the better by whatsoever event occurs to him in
   external respects; for that love is an active principle in him, that
   co-operates to the making good of the promise. It thinks no evil, it
   makes a man construe well, all the divine dispensations, it forms his
   spirit to a compliance with the divine pleasure, and so, good will come
   out of it to such a one, to a so qualified subject, whatsoever the
   event be. And therefore, all the business of prayer that it may be
   significant and available, is to have it formed and modelled according
   to the tenour of the divine will as God hath expressed that will to us
   in his word, and to pray for things agreeably to the discovery we have
   thereof: that is, with a peremptory confidence, in reference to those
   things that are expressly promised; and with submission, in reference
   to all other things: satisfying ourselves, with this, that he who is
   the most perfectly absolute, supreme God, nothing of evil can proceed
   from him, but as an ill affected subject turns things into evil to
   itself. And so the gospel becomes "the savour of death unto death." to
   an ill disposed mind; not from what it hath in itself, or as it
   proceeds from God, but only from the disaffected state and condition of
   the subject. And then again,

   (8.) We are to consider this, that the interests of men in this world,
   in reference to their temporal concernments, do so generally interfere
   and cross with one another and oppose one another, that it is
   impossible all prayers should be granted. For there are many times
   prayers against prayers. One man or this sort of men prays for this
   event, and another sort, for the quite contrary event. Therefore, it is
   most absolutely necessary that the divine counsel should moderate, and
   have its agency, not only in bringing about events, but even in forming
   the spirits of men. When interests do so clash, and desires and prayers
   so contradict one another, (as they many times do,) with what confusion
   would it fill the world, if every irregular desire should be granted?
   And indeed, if the wills of men were to regulate the will of God, and
   their prayers were to prescribe, it would make fearful work in the
   world: if we had such a kind of fatuum numen, a silly deity, to be the
   object of our addresses and prayers, that were to use no counsel, no
   wisdom in judging what is fit to be done, and what is not, but every
   human desire should engage the divine power, and employ the divine
   hand, with what ruin and desolation would men's prayers fill the world!
   And so this world would be made a desolate wilderness, at that rate, if
   the prayers of men, without the interposition of the counsel of the
   divine will, were to prescribe finally what were to be done for them.
   And therefore, again,

   (9.) It ought to be considered, that wherever there is any such thing
   as right prayer, there is a divine Agent to be employed, in reference
   to the whole business of prayer. As we have an Advocate and Intercessor
   without us at the right hand of God above, so, all that do belong to
   God have an Advocate and Intercessor within them. All the children of
   God, because they are such, because they are sons, God sends the Spirit
   of his Son into their hearts to teach them to cry, Abba Father; as Gal.
   iv. 6. compared with Rom. viii. 15. And it is therefore, called the
   Spirit of adoption, because it belongs to the adopted ones, to those
   that are taken into that state and condition of sons; because they are
   sons, the Spirit is given. It is an intolerable injury, and absurdity,
   that among us who are called Christians, with whom it is an article of
   our creed, that we believe in the Holy Ghost, we should so little
   consider what hand and part, he is to have in this matter. It is an
   idle vanity to think, that he is to dictate words to us, and that there
   ought not to be prayer, but what the Spirit ought to indite the very
   words of. No, that is not the business of his office; but to possess
   the soul with such a living, internal sense to which words will
   correspond; that soul that is filled with such a sense, will not want
   suitable words, (at least between God and itself) in which to utter
   that sense to him. And so is the work of the Holy Ghost, in this
   matter, expressed in that Rom. viii. 27. That when we know not what to
   pray for of ourselves, that Spirit makes intercession in us according
   to the will of God; (so we read it and do interpose in the translation
   more than is in the text,) it makes intercession according to God, (so
   it is in the original,) not barely according to his will, but in
   subserviency to his interest; and to his great one, which (it is true)
   his will must always respect too, as we cannot doubt. And therefore, if
   he is to be applied unto, and relied upon, that great Agent of God: and
   we are to refer it to him (as it were) to mind our petitions, that they
   may be right in form, this is the great business of that Spirit; he is
   thus far (as it were) the Master of requests, and we are to resign
   ourselves to him, to put our spirits under his formation, under the
   dominion of the Divine Spirit. "I do not know whether my mind may agree
   with the divine mind yea or no, but O! do thou make it agree, and
   conform it thereunto." And lastly,

   (10.) We have, upon the whole, this to consider, that all prayers once
   so rectified and put into the right form and tenour, they do ever
   obtain their principal answer. According to the great platform and
   model of prayer that is given us, we pray with principal reference to
   the divine honour, if we pray aright, that the name of God may be
   hallowed; we pray that the governing power of his kingdom may obtain
   and take place all the world over: we pray that his will may be done on
   earth, as it is done in heaven. We have particular inclinations and
   desires of our own; these we are never to express but with this
   reserve, "Lord, if these desires of mine, agree with thy will; if they
   agree not with that, I renounce them, I disclaim them." So every good
   man is then answered, if he be denied: if he be denied in one respect,
   he is answered and his petition granted in higher and more principal
   respects; for the principal thing he aims at is, that God may be
   glorified, "Hallowed be thy name;" and that in order and subserviency
   thereunto the governing power of his kingdom may take place, and that
   his will may be done. These are the great and principal petitions: and
   all things else are to be petitioned for but as they subserve these.

   And therefore, now to sum up all. Prayer, it may be from two sorts of
   persons, either from a devoted or from an apostate creature. Prayer,
   proceeding from a devoted soul can never fail of its principal answer:
   for every such prayer is influenced by supreme love to God; his
   interests comprehend all our true interests: so that all doth but come
   to this, whether I love God more than myself, then that love will
   always dictate such prayers as can never miss of their answer. That is,
   if I pray as a devoted creature, and to be a devoted creature is to
   pray, is to love God more than myself. But, if I pray as an apostate
   creature, that is, as one that is gone off from God and keeps off from
   God and hath a separate interest from God, and will not come to him and
   return to him again; then my prayers always run after this tenour,
   "Lord I pray that my will may be done, that my interest may take place
   and be served, whatsoever be comes of all, or any concernments
   besides." But what! would we have the counsels of the divine will to
   give place to such insolent requests as these? that were, in effect, to
   pray, "Lord do thou descend and come down from thy throne and resign it
   to me, and let me set up for myself; I would be a god to myself, and I
   desire to make no other use of divine power, (finding my own impotency
   in many things,) but only to serve my own purposes and ends."

   Therefore, there is all imaginable encouragement to sincere prayer,
   from this doctrine, that God doth all things according to the counsel
   of his own will. And this, surely, we are greatly concerned to consider
   in such a juncture of time as we are now cast upon: nothing can be more
   opportune. We have a dubious prospect before us; we know not how things
   may is sue. Now to pray with hearts possessed with the sense that God
   doth all things after the counsel of his own will, is the best
   preparation for prayer, in reference to the present concernments of
   this season, that can be thought. That is, it is such a disposition of
   spirit that will, in this duty of prayer, be both most honourable to
   God, and most comfortable to ourselves.

   Most honourable to God; nothing could reflect on him more than to pray
   with a contrary notion concerning him; that is, that he doth not do
   things after the counsel of his own will, but as poor foolish creatures
   here in this world, shall prescribe and dictate to him: they make him
   do any thing, draw him to this or that by the importunity of their
   requests and desires. You cannot give a notion of God more injurious to
   him, or more repugnant to his very nature. For then we must suppose him
   a Being of mere power, absolute, almighty power, which any fool may
   command when he pleaseth. What a strange sort of Deity do we worship!
   particularly if we pray with such a notion of God as this. But nothing
   can be more comfortable to ourselves, than to supplicate him, according
   to this true notion of him, that he doth all things after the counsel
   of his own will. With what quiet minds may we pray; and acquiesce in
   all the issues of things! Things lie in the best hands they can lie. We
   have this to satisfy our hearts in: and though we pray as men, we are
   to expect he should answer as God. We can pray but with the wisdom and
   foresight of poor fallible creatures: but then we are to expect him to
   answer according to the wisdom of an all-comprehending Deity. And as
   this is most highly honourable to him; so it will be most highly
   satisfying and comfortable to ourselves, and upon the best terms from
   which a reasonable mind can receive any satisfaction.

LECTURE VII. [21]

   It only remains to make some Use of all that hath hitherto been spoken.
   And so comprehensive a truth as this, you will apprehend to be of very
   large and copious usefulness. I shall contract as much as the matter
   admits. It serves,

   1. To shew us, how we are to form our notion of God. And if any have a
   mistaken one, how they may rectify and reform it. It lets us see we are
   to conceive of God to be a Being of infinite wisdom, for according to
   our notion of counsel, it is the immediate product of wisdom. Only,
   when we apply it to God we must do it so as to sever all that it
   imports of imperfection, and to include all that it imports of highest
   perfection. We find it needful with us, to consult and advise with our
   friends sometimes; however, with ourselves, and our more deliberate
   thoughts; but no such thing can be said of God, with whom all things
   lie open, in one infinite, eternal and all-comprehending view at once.
   That is not the meaning of counsel with him, as it is with us, as
   though being uncertain and doubtful, we did need to be counselled and
   advised: but that of perfection, which we mean by counsel and most
   perfect judgment of things, that we are to ascribe to him: and so, as
   that is the result of wisdom, it is with him in the highest perfection
   without consideration, so, that we can have no notion of wisdom, that
   doth not imply counsel; nor of divine counsel, that doth not imply the
   most perfect, most exact, and most accurate wisdom. We see he doth all
   things according to the counsel of his will, so as never to err in any
   thing; never to make one wrong step. For how often is he celebrated by
   expressions, that do import so much, God who is wise. What glorious
   ascriptions are there to him as such. "To God only wise, be honour and
   glory." Rom. xvi. 2J. And so that of 1 Tim. i. 17. You have the same
   kind of doxology even in the same terms. And so in the epistle of Jude,
   the concluding words of that epistle: "To God only wise, be honour, and
   glory, and dominion, for ever and ever." This appropriate term, only,
   only wise, speaks that there is no wisdom, that is not from him, nor in
   him, that he is primary wisdom, the original seat of wisdom. If any man
   lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all liberally. He can
   do so, he hath it in all its fulness, in its most absolute plenitude in
   himself. James i. 5. And therefore, is he said to be the Father of
   lights, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, every congenerous
   gift; we must understand it agreeable to so exuberant a Fountain: and
   hereby, we are to rectify our thoughts of God, if we have taken up
   wrong ones; for we must conceive of the several attributes of the
   Divine Being, agreeably to this, as they are complicated with this most
   perfect wisdom, as that is most especially conjunct therewith. If any
   should think of God's power, as only an act of boisterous omnipotency,
   working at random, not guided by wisdom and counsel: if they should
   conceive of his will, as if it were a stiff, inflexible resolvedness of
   doing things without judgment or wisdom, if they should conceive of his
   wrath, as an all-consuming flame, burning up all before it, without
   distinction, without discrimination: if any should think of his love as
   a fond inclination to this or that person, or thing, without being
   directed by wisdom or counsel: all this is infinitely to wrong God; it
   is indeed to create to ourselves a God like ourselves. But this is
   infinitely injurious to represent him by ourselves, as a being of mere
   power, and of mere will, without considering, that he is a Being of
   infinite wisdom, and so doth all things according to the counsel of his
   own will. And again,

   2. We are further to learn, how we are to conceive of God's works; for
   every thing works as it is: and as he is a Being of wisdom, we are to
   reckon, that there must be characters of wisdom and counsel upon all
   that he doth. There is eminently so, upon the works of his creation. He
   hath established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens
   by his discretion. Jer. x. 12. Wisdom is the parent of order, where
   soever there is any thing of order, that surely must be attributed to
   wisdom as the directive cause of it; it must be found, if not in second
   causes, yet in the First. The stable ordinances of day and night, the
   certain returns of summer and win ter, the regular motions of sun,
   moon, and stars, and the like: in all these we are to behold the wisdom
   of God, who hath, settled things by so accurate counsel, according
   whereunto he doth all that he doth. And so we are to conceive
   concerning the works of his providence too, that there are counsel and
   wisdom, which conduct them all, which regulate human affairs where in
   men have themselves but a subordinate agency, under the supreme and
   sovereign Ruler of all. We are to reckon nothing falls out casually,
   nothing undetermined, either to be wrought or effected by him, or at
   least to be permitted, for greater and more preponderating reasons,
   against the restraints that might have been laid upon the second
   causes, by which they are wrought. And again,

   3. We are further to learn hence, the extensiveness and universality of
   God's powerful and governing influence. He worketh all things, he hath
   an agency about all that is done. It is true, the words are capable of
   being thus understood, He worketh whatsoever he worketh according to
   the counsel of his own will. But there cannot a hand be lift up, nor a
   foot stir, not a power or faculty of any creature be exerted, but he
   hath a working agency one way or other in reference there to: not so
   much as a sparrow falls to the ground, but it is within the compass of
   that agency of his, which doth all things after the counsel of his own
   will. Not so much as a hair drops from any head without him: all
   things, as they refer to him, are done with number, weight and measure:
   and so, wisdom and counsel, have a universal exercise, in reference to
   all things that are done under the sun, even the meaner concernments of
   men in this world If you go to the business of agriculture or husbandry
   in the general; the several methods of husbandmen in ploughing, sowing,
   threshing and the like, are all said to be from the Lord, who is
   wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working, Isaiah xxviii. 29. And
   therefore, we are hereupon to acknowledge, and own with adoration, the
   universal extensiveness of his governing influence; as was formerly
   noted in the opening of the words, in working all things; that is the
   expression, an energy that is most intrinsic, intimate, inward to every
   inferior agent, still exerting and putting forth itself, in whatsoever
   is wrought or done under the sun. And he is even more intimate to us,
   (as paganish light itself, doth more anciently observe) than we are to
   ourselves. That phrase is fetched from more refined paganism, into the
   schools of Christians, that he is more inward to us, than we are to
   ourselves, so as that there is a divine energy working and stirring in
   every created agent whatsoever. And,

   4. We may next learn hence, the reasonableness and congruity of all his
   public constitutions and laws, which he hath made for the government of
   his reasonable creatures. Legislation is a great act of sovereignty,
   indeed the prime and most principal. If God do all things according to
   the counsel of his own will, it is according to the counsel of his will
   that he hath made laws for those who are capable of government by law,
   as only the reasonable creature is. Laws are frequently spoken of under
   the name of counsels. Your human laws are commonly called consulta as
   among the Romans, those that went under the name of senatus consulta;
   such things as were advised upon, and, as it were, weighed in balances.
   Are they fit, or are they not? Will this be a useful constitution, yea
   or no? And so is the frame of divine laws spoken of, under the name of
   the counsel of God. The pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of
   God against themselves. Luke vii. 30. It is spoken in opposition to
   Christ and his teachings. Those that were doctors of the law among the
   Jews, they rejected the counsel of God against themselves. Indeed, the
   whole revelation of God's mind, about the salvation of men, it bears
   that name, which included the perceptive as a very noble part of it. I
   have not shunned, saith the apostle, to declare unto you the whole
   counsel of God. Acts xx. 27. In all this, therefore, we ought to
   acknowledge and adore a divine wisdom, and especially in that, which is
   the standing constitution, for the governing of men, in reference to
   their salvation and final blessedness, since the apostasy, and you find
   God most highly celebrated and magnified, upon that account, in that
   Rom. 16. latter end: the apostle there speaking of the gospel
   constitution, under the name of a mystery, concludes all thus, "Now to
   him that is of power to establish you, according to my gospel, and the
   preaching of Jesus Christ," (ver. 25.) according to the revelation of
   the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is
   made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the
   commandment of the everlasting God, made known to ail nations, for the
   obedience of faith, "To God only wise, be glory, through Jesus Christ,
   for ever." His wisdom is conspicuous in this established constitution
   of his, which is to last through all the ages of time, and which is the
   constitution of that kingdom, which is never to be shaken. That is
   called the kingdom not to be taken down: Heb. xii. latter end. The
   compages whereof are so firm and strong, as to suit a designed
   perpetuity. Whereupon, they that live under the gospel, are warned
   concerning their deportment under it. Now that we have received a
   "kingdom, that cannot be shaken, let us have grace to serve God
   acceptably, with reverence and godly fear." He will not now be dallied
   with by men, whom he hath put under the dispensations of the gospel; as
   that epistle to the Hebrews begins. There were some temporary
   constitutions wherein God did deal with men, and speak to them in
   various and variable methods. But now, he hath spoken to us by his Son:
   and this is such a state of things as shall last as long as the world
   lasts, and those that do not comport with this method, or law of grace,
   in order to being saved, shall never be saved! Therefore, let us seek
   grace to serve him acceptably. The last efforts of divine wisdom are
   seen in this constitution.

   5. It thereupon, therefore, further lets us see, the impudence of
   sinners, who confront their own imaginations, and their own lusts, to
   the wisdom and counsel of the divine constitutions; for that is indeed
   the case, and the very state of the controversy between God and a
   guilty creature that hath been, in an apostasy from him, and doth yet
   refuse to return. This is the very sum of the controversy between God
   and them, Who is wiser, who is best capable of prescribing and giving
   laws? for wisdom is the most conspicuous thing, (as was said) in
   legislation. Authority is supposed, it is true, but if there be never
   so unquestionable authority, if there be not wisdom to use it, it would
   be strange work that one destitute of wisdom would make of governing
   authority; strange laws, strange edicts there would be, where there was
   uncontroulable power without wisdom. But (as was told you) when laws
   are to be made, here is the great exercise of governing wisdom, such as
   doth befit the state of a ruler, to consider how the exigency of the
   case may be answered, what laws will be more suitable for such and
   such, or for a people in such circumstances. Now, when the counsels of
   heaven are opened, (as it were) into a result, in such a constitution;
   here is the Law of that kingdom that is erected and set up for them
   that are to be saved. And here comes an insolent creature and contends
   against the Lawgiver, and disputes the matter with him that gave him
   breath; what impudency is here! That law of grace, it saith,
   wheresoever it is promulgated, to them that come under this government
   of grace, or will be the disciples of grace, grace doth teach them that
   live under it, "to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
   soberly, godly and righteously in the world." But here, is an impure,
   obstinate sinner, to whom notices are given of the good and acceptable
   will of God to this purpose, that the gospel that is preached to him,
   the law of the Redeemer's kingdom, it saith at the very first, Repent,
   now that kingdom is come among you, repent, turn. The divine wisdom
   saith to the sinner, "Turn, turn or die, turn or thou art lost." But he
   saith, It is wiser to go on, to persist in my own course; it is a wiser
   thing to live a stranger from God still, and as without God in the
   world. Divine wisdom saith to men, "God hath a mind and design to save
   you, deny you all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and subject yourselves
   to God," "No, it is wiser (saith the sinner,) to live an ungodly life
   still, it is a wiser thing to lay the reins on my own lusts, and do
   whatsoever is good in mine own eyes, it is wiser to please my own flesh
   than the God that made me; it is wiser to indulge sensual inclination
   and follow the imagination of my own heart." For men, I say, to
   confront their own imaginations and lusts to the divine counsel, it
   speaks the height of impudency in sinners, that they do not turn, that
   they will not be brought back to God. And,

   6. It further lets us see how sad and forlorn the case of unreconciled
   and impenitent sinners is. God hath done all things according to the
   counsel of his own will, therefore, the constitution that he hath made
   and settled, is uncapable of change. There is an immutability stamped
   upon the divine counsel, and what is likely, then, to become of such
   men as run counter to all the wisdom and counsel, that is conspicuous
   in the divine constitutions? Because of their perfection they cannot be
   changed, and because of the sinner's wickedness, he will not. God
   cannot change, and men will not. What is then like to become of things
   between him and them? But,

   7. We may further learn hence, how hopeful and comfortable their state
   is, whose minds and hearts are brought to a liking of the methods of
   God, for the saving of sinners, to a compliance and agreement with
   them. O! happy man! The unerring, and therefore unalterable counsels of
   heaven, have determined well concerning thee, and concerning thy state.
   You see in this same chapter where the text lies, that the gospel
   constitution carries, (as it were) this inscription upon it, "To the
   praise of the glory of his grace." Look upon the whole frame of divine
   constitutions, that refer to the saving of sinners, and you may see (as
   it were) in golden letters written upon this noble fabric, "To the
   praise of the glory of his grace." Thus the gospel constitutions stand,
   (as it were) dedicated, "To the praise and glory of divine grace,
   wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." And observe then,
   what follows in the next verse, "In whom we have redemption, through
   his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
   grace, wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence."
   This is the mystery of God; he hath made known to us the mystery of his
   will; it is a most mysterious thing that ever he should have such a
   will towards me. But he doth all things according to the counsel of his
   own will; and thereupon, there is an immutability and unchangeableness
   upon the determination of it, as you see in that Heb. vi. 17. Wherein,
   God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise, the
   immutability of his counsel; He hath confirmed it by his oath, added to
   his word, that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for
   God to lie, the heirs of promise might receive that strong, that
   steady, that unshaken consolation. It is to be attributed to want and
   deficiency of wisdom and foresight, that the constitutions and
   determinations of men, need so often to be altered. Such and such an
   inconvenience was not foreseen; such a law was made, and it may be, a
   little trial and experience, shew it to be very inconvenient, and so,
   it is fain to be reversed, repealed, or needs some explanatory
   additions, or the like; it is reckoned a piece of meanness, and
   disparagement, to be put to alter edicts; and because the Medes and
   Persians were a proud and haughty nation, therefore, were their laws
   and statutes irreversible, never to be changed; so that they did assume
   to themselves infallibility, and beyond what could agree to the
   condition and capacity of creatures, of men, in an imperfect state. But
   the divine counsel being all upon foresight, all the determinations
   thereof, being made and settled upon one comprehensive view, here is no
   place for the supposition of a change. And therefore, is this most
   highly consolatory to all that feel their hearts comply with the gospel
   terms, with the evangelical constitutions: "I find my heart is wrought
   to a closure with that, and I am never to fear a change." It is the
   effect of his counsel, his immutable counsel which he hath shewn, that
   such as we might have strong consolation who fall in with, and comply
   with his terms.

   8. It further serves to let us see the vanity of their confidence, who
   have any separate interest, and drive any opposite design from, and to,
   this of the great God himself. His counsels must stand, and the
   thoughts of his heart to all generations; whereas, the counsels of the
   froward are turned head long: as the expression is, Job v. 13. How
   unequal is the contest, when there comes to be a competition between
   the design of a mortal man, though never so insolent, and that of the
   immortal God? Some of themselves have thought it insolent for creatures
   so to assume. Rabshakeh thought it were an imaginary thing, and very
   wrongly charged upon Hezekiah, yet seems to look upon it as a great
   piece of pride, "Thou sayest, I have counsel and strength for war,"
   thinking it to be an unbecoming thing: yet, though he only speaks of
   the counsel and might of Hezekiah as opposed to his own, or that of his
   master Sennacherib; but he never thought how insolent it was to oppose
   that, his counsel to that of heaven. "I have counsel and strength for
   war." but how soon are all those counsels and strength blown upon,
   blasted and brought to nothing when God hath any work of his to do,
   whereunto, that counsel and might are opposed. And to conclude, I add,

   9. That since God doth all things according to the counsel of his own
   will, the times and seasons for doing any great work that he intends,
   are always chosen by him, with most accurate wisdom. They are most
   fitly chosen; therefore, where as, we are apt to blame the divine
   methods because he doth not take our time and our way, how unreasonable
   is it, since it is plain, that all the things he hath to do are affixed
   to particular seasons, which lie under divine determinations? "Unto
   every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the
   sun. Eccles. iii. 1. And if you will look a little further in that
   book, you will see there, that as there is a time for every purpose,
   every event, so there is also judgment for every time, there is
   judgment, which is the effect of counsel, or that whereunto counsel
   results. For every thing there is a time and judgment. And so
   thereupon, there comes to be a critical nick of time into which such
   and such things must fall, and into no other. And therefore, it is
   said, that "the misery of man is great upon the earth." Eccles. viii.
   6. Because there is time and judgment to every purpose, therefore, that
   is, be cause time and judgment are not considered, are not under stood
   by men, therefore, their misery is great. And so they are taken, many
   times, in an evil time, without foresight; they do not know the time;
   not because they are ignorant of the time, but because they are
   unready, unprepared, for what is to be done and suffered in such or
   such a juncture of time. And so you see their case is represented
   still, upon that account, miserable. But the wise, they do consider
   time and judgment: Happy men! therefore, happy men! as those two verses
   full in together: Eccles. viii. 5, 6. This ought to be considered, and
   it makes a man a happy man that considers it. Therefore, how quiet and
   calm may all men's minds be; and the minds of the wise will be that do
   equally consider things. We find things were determined most
   punctually, relating to the great concernments of that people, God had
   in the world heretofore, when they were yet an unconformed people. Four
   hundred and thirty years must pass, just so many from the time of his
   capitulating with their head, Abraham, striking a covenant with him.
   And so much time there must be, because the sins of the Amorites were
   not yet full, and Canaan could not he ready for the reception of them,
   and there did four hundred and thirty years pass upon this account.
   When they were in captivity in Babylon, seventy years was determined
   for that. When the woman is in the wilderness, there is a set time;
   forty and two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days. And we are not
   to think that the determinations of divine wisdom and counsel are less
   certain because they are less known to us, and we only see by the event
   what was determined. Twenty years have elapsed since the haughty French
   tyrant hath been the terror and scourge of Europe, and especially of
   reformed Christendom; for it is so long, (in the year 1672) that lie
   first attempted on our neighbours and brethren of Holland. Many might
   have been apt to think, why hath not God animadverted on him sooner,
   put upon him an earlier rebuke? Why was it not the last year? Why was
   not his fleet scattered, and his army broken then, as they have been,
   in several parts, this year? Or why was it not the year before that?
   Why, it is a foolish thing for us to contend and dispute with the
   counsel of heaven, and we are to refer it to the determination of
   divine counsel, to choose the fittest time to begin to animadvert on so
   insolent an enemy, and the aptest means how first to let him know that
   he is a mortal, and that they in whom he trusts, have a mortality upon
   them; that they are liable to defeatments, to disappointments; that
   their strength is not brass or iron, or such as cannot be broken when
   he will. He can make so weak and mutable a thing as the wind to serve
   his purpose against so haughty a one. We are to consider that these
   things fall out according to the counsel of the divine will: he is not
   to give us a reason why no such thing was, so many years ago, why he
   did not raise up such and such, who might have abated his pride, and
   brought a blast upon him long before now.

   Hitherto, we have by way of use, from the doctrine of this text, let
   you see so many inferences and recommended so many truths from it,
   which, according to the aptitude that it hath in it, may help to
   rectify and regulate our thoughts, apprehensions, and notions in many
   things.

LECTURE VIII. [22]

   The further use which remains, is to direct our practice; for in many
   respects, it hath in it a great aptitude, and suitableness too. In
   order to this, it is requisite,

   1. That we take up the several sorts of the considerations which may be
   had of the counsels of the divine will. And then,

   2. That we reflect upon our own distemper, and the faultiness of our
   spirits and practice, in reference hereunto. And accommodately, then,
   to consider both of the counsels of the divine will, and of our own
   miscarriages, and so recommend to you sundry heads of instruction, in
   reference to our future practice. We are,

   1. Variously to consider the counsels of the divine will. They may be
   either considered indefinitely; or else, they may be considered with
   some distinction, according to the various references they may bear
   towards us, and our concernments and affairs, whether they may be
   eternal or temporal; and these, whether they be private or public.

   And again, whether they be known to us, or unknown; so variously may
   the counsels of the divine will be considered. And then, for his
   precepts, which are the result too, of the counsel of his will. They
   expressly declare what it is the counsel of his will we should do,
   though therein also, we are to expect his co-operation; he working and
   in-working also therein, according to the counsel of his will. And many
   times, the counsels of his will are known to us only by the event. We
   never know what God would do in this or that instance, till the event
   shews us. And so in such and such things, because the event hath not
   shewn the counsels of the divine will in many things, they are yet
   altogether unknown to us.

   2. Now, according to these various considerations of the counsels of
   the divine will, we shall find ourselves, many ways, to be faulty in
   reference thereunto.

   As in reference to the counsels of God indefinitely considered, that
   either we ourselves do not firmly enough believe the great doctrine of
   this text, that he really doth all things according to the counsel of
   his own will; or that we deeply enough consider it not, and carry not
   an habitual sense in our souls correspondent thereunto: that we have
   not high and great thoughts as we ought hereupon: that we are so prone
   to dispute matters with him: that there is no more of dutiful
   compliance with the counsels of his will, even then when they are
   known: that many are so apt to cherish in themselves a perpetual dread
   about their eternal concernments, which lie most certainly under the
   disposition of his own eternal will: that they are so distrustful of so
   wise and mighty an Agent, that doth all things according to the counsel
   of his own will: that there is no more of quietude, tranquillity and
   rest of spirit in him, so considered, as one that doth what he
   pleaseth, and always according to wise counsel.

   Now, according to these various considerations, which we ought to have,
   both of God and ourselves, of his counsels, and of our own miscarriages
   and distempers, are these instructions to be, which I am now to
   recommend to you. And,

   (1.) I pray, Let us charge this upon ourselves, more thoroughly to
   establish the belief of this truth in our own souls, that God, in very
   deed, doth work all things after the counsel of his own will. Let not
   our minds waver and hover, in reference here unto, as if this were a
   doubtful matter, as if possibly, it might be otherwise 3 as if either
   he were ignorant or oscitant, and unconcerned about the affairs of his
   creature, as if anything might possibly fall out without his
   advertency. For we should consider with ourselves, being once at a
   certainty about the existence of God, about which if we be not at a
   certainty, we can be certain of nothing; if (I say) we be at a
   certainty concerning this, and we may be as sure of it as that we are,
   and that this world is, and that there is any such thing as wisdom and
   power and goodness, any where to be observed and taken notice of in the
   world; we and this world, and whatsoever there is of excellency and
   perfection in it, must all have some original; they are not nothing,
   and therefore could not come out of nothing. If we be (I say again) at
   a certainty about this, that is, in short, that there is a God, we may
   be at equal certainty about this, that he worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will. For I beseech you, reflect and consider how
   well would it agree with your own minds, and with the natural notions
   and conceptions that are placed and fixed there, to conceive of an
   ignorant God, or of an impotent God, or of an oscitant, neglectful God.
   Do but consider, how well any such conception or apprehension can agree
   with the natural notices you have in your minds already, and may take
   notice of, if you reflect. And thereupon, let disputes be at an end
   with yon, and fix and establish the belief of it in your own souls,
   that in very deed he worketh all things according to the counsel of his
   own will. And,

   (2.) That hereupon (this being once thoroughly believed) it may be more
   deeply considered: and that we would labour to carry an habitual sense
   of it about us, from day to day, through this world. For to any one
   that considers, these things are very distinguishable; dead notions,
   and living sense, even in reference to the same truth. I have such a
   truth in my mind, but how have I it? If I have it as a dead notion,
   then it is all one to me as if I had it not. Let it not, therefore,
   satisfy us to have so mighty, important a truth as this lie in our
   minds as a dead notion; but let us labour to have it there as living
   sense, that we may resort to upon all occasions, and draw forth into
   present use as the matter shall, from time to time, require. And,

   (3.) Labour to live adoring lives towards the glorious God, so
   considered, as one that worketh all things after the counsel of his own
   will. How should we, hereupon, be composed of ado ration towards the
   blessed God, so as that wherever any actual present instance occurs and
   appears to us, wherein that agency of his shews itself, we be always in
   a disposition to bow our heads and worship! Here is a manifest effort
   of Deity, as the power and wisdom of God, that doth all things after
   the counsel of his own will. We should especially labour to maintain an
   adoring frame and disposition of spirit, with reference to these two
   great excellencies of the Divine Being which appear and shine forth in
   view, in this truth held forth to us in this text: "who worketh all
   things after the counsel of his own will:" that is, almighty power and
   infinite wisdom. Two things, than which nothing can be supposed to make
   an object more adorable, to make any thing a fitter object of
   adoration. Almightiness--he worketh all things. Is not he almighty that
   can do all things? and infinite wisdom--for he doth all things after
   the counsel of his own will. So, that wheresoever there is an exertion
   of his power, there is an exertion of his wisdom too, guiding that
   efficacious exertion of his will, that he doth not act in any thing by
   a boisterous and extravagant exertion of power, without judgment or
   without wisdom or without counsel, that all things that are done, are
   done by him: one way or other he hath an agency in every thing; and
   that nothing is done by him but by the direction of that wisdom that
   can mistake in nothing: all things consulted, and done after the
   counsels of his own will. A man of great might and of great celebrated
   wisdom too, how venerable a person is he in the account of all? But to
   have these two things in conjunction, to wit, almighty power, with
   infinite, unlimited wisdom, sets a very adorable Object before our
   eyes. And it is a reproach to us, if we, thereupon, do not carry an
   adoring frame of spirit, every day, about this world with us.

   (4.) Another instruction, hereupon, will be, that we never contend
   against him. What! Against him that worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will? Is he a fit Object for our contention? Will we
   undertake to dispute matters with him? Think with yourselves, both how
   foolish and how wicked that must be. He that can do all things,
   whatsoever he will, it must be a very foolish thing to contend with
   him. What shall we get by it? He that contends with God, can he hope to
   be a gainer? He that strives with his Maker, woe to him: all that we
   can gain by it is but to infer a woe upon ourselves. Isaiah xlv. 9.
   Therefore, it is a very foolish thing to enter into a contest which we
   are to despair beforehand of ever getting any thing by. And then, How
   wicked a thing is it! For certainly, the sovereignty must belong to him
   who worketh all things, and that after the counsel of his own will. It
   must, upon all accounts, belong to him. He will certainly carry the
   matter, and have the sovereignty. He worketh all things: almighty and
   resistless power is lodged in him; and he ought to have the
   sovereignty. For to whom should it so fitly appertain, as to him that
   doth all things according to counsel, never any thing rashly, nothing
   unfit in itself, nothing unseasonable, whensoever it is done?
   Therefore, (as the expression is there) he that contends with God, let
   him answer it; let him try if he can; for to be sure he never can, he
   never will be able to answer it, to enter into a contest with God, who
   is One that so wisely, and according to so stable, and so steady
   counsel and judgment doth all things. Again,

   (5.) Labour dutifully to comport with him as he is such a One that
   "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will," and according
   to such considerations, (as hath been hinted to you,) as we may
   severally have of these counsels of the will of God. There are counsels
   of his will that are made known and signified by his express precepts.
   As was told you, the last time, legislation, making of laws, is one of
   the prime acts of wisdom, wherein above all things that excellency is
   to be conspicuous and shew forth itself. Now we shall dutifully comport
   with the counsels of his will, made known by his precepts and laws,
   when we do obey them. That when once we find that charge laid upon us
   to do so and so, by express divine precept, we immediately labour to
   get our spirits formed to an obedient compliance, saying within
   ourselves, "I have nothing to do, in reference to such and such a
   thing, but to obey." "Mortify such a lust," saith the command, "Lord I
   yield and will endeavour to obey." "Love me with all the heart and soul
   and mind and strength:" "Lord, I will to my uttermost." It is a law
   founded in counsel; there could never have been a wiser law, nor a more
   merciful one, from a good God, towards an indigent, depending creature,
   than that I should place my love, my desire, my delight on himself. If,
   considering me as a wandering creature, I find his word saith to me,
   "Repent;" a wise counsel is spoken to me according to the counsel of
   his will. I will persist in sin no longer; I will turn that I may live.
   If he have made known his counsels concerning such and such things that
   he will do, that he will put an end to this world, that the wickedness
   of the wicked shall come to an end; that his Son shall appear in the
   end of time, and shall be the final Judge; it is then dutiful to comply
   with such counsels of the divine will, to be always in an expecting
   posture: to say, "O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,
   according as thou hast determined; we approve of the counsel of the
   divine will, and will patiently wait till it come. And as for that
   appearance and coming of our Lord, we will wait and long for it;
   looking for it as the reviving, heart gladdening hope of our souls."
   Whereinsoever the divine will is made known to us, or which way soever
   the counsels of it are known, let them be dutifully comported with.
   Such things as are only known to us by the event, let us dutifully own
   and acknowledge them. I know it was the divine will, according to
   counsel, that such and such things should be either effected by
   himself, or permitted to be effected by those in whom he saw such a
   disposition, or from whom he did not withhold power to effect it.
   Again,

   (6.) Take heed of slavish dread, in reference to your own eternal
   concernments. Most certain it is, that there are counsels of the divine
   will conversant about the eternal concernments of every one of us; but
   take we heed of slavish dread in reference hereto. There is no cause
   for it. It is an ungospel-like spirit to live in a slavish dread, even
   about our eternal concernments, under a gospel of grace which deals
   with us principally about them, and whose special, particular, and
   great design is to advise and direct us, even touching them.

   But it may be here said, How is it possible for one in an uncertainty,
   not to be in a dread about his everlasting concernments, about those
   concernments of his, which however they lie, will never alter, will
   always be the same? One that finds himself to have been, hitherto,
   under the power of some reigning lust or other, have not I reason to be
   in a continual dread, what shall become of me for ever?

   That was a thing we find represented as not suitable to the state of a
   very Cain. Suppose thy state to be as bad, suppose thyself a very Cain
   for wickedness, you see how God be speaks him, when there was some
   present token that he was not so acceptable as Abel was. Cain might
   perceive it, here upon his countenance falls, and God reasons the
   matter with him, "Why is thy countenance fallen? If thou dost well,
   shalt thou not be accepted? If thou persist still to do evil, it is
   true, sin, that is, vengeance, the consequent of sin, lies at the door.
   But if thou dost well, shalt not thou be accepted?" So he bespeaks even
   a Cain; so you must understand him to bespeak you. In the worst that
   you can suppose of your case, this is the counsel of the divine will,
   even concerning thee. Hereupon, then, God ought to be the Object of thy
   reverence; not the Object of thy dread. Thou oughtest to reverence him,
   not to dread him, as one that doth all things after the counsel of his
   own will. But you will say again, "Where lies the difference?"

   The difference is great, and most manifest, between reverence and
   dread. Reverence carries love in it: dread carries hatred. And am I now
   to dispute the matter with you, whether any man ought to hate God?
   Ought you to hate him, think you? Ought he to be the Object of your
   hate? No, place all your reverence upon him, which certainly carries
   love in it. For reverence hath goodness for its object; the most
   excellent good is the object of my reverence. By how much the more
   there is of goodness in any one, by so much the more is he the object
   of my reverence. But it is evil, destructive, pernicious evil, that is
   the object of my hate, and consequently of my dread. But you are no
   more to think that God can be the Object of a man's dread, than you can
   think that a fit notion, or a self-consistent notion, an evil God. Can
   there be any such thing as an evil God? There can be no such thing as
   the affection of dread (involving essentially hatred in it) duly placed
   upon God, unless you would suppose an evil God, which is a
   contradiction even in the very notion. Therefore, turn all your hate
   (let the case be the worst that can be supposed) upon yourself, and all
   your love upon God. Think of him with reverence that carries love in
   it. And think of yourselves with that dread (as you are yet wicked
   creatures) which carries hate in it. And this is a true gospel frame,
   to hate one's self, loathe one's self, fall out with one's self, judge
   one's self, condemn one's self; but all the while to reverence God: let
   him be ever amiable in your eyes.

   Aye, but you will say, "How can this be but matter of dread to me, when
   I find myself a wicked creature, and whom, therefore, the wrath of God
   must pursue? for his wrath is revealed from heaven against the
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men: and I find myself such a one, a
   wicked creature, an ungodly, an unrighteous creature."

   Do but consider here, the objection carries its own answer in it. "The
   wrath of God is revealed from heaven." Against what? Against
   ungodliness, against unrighteousness: and you are such a one. But what,
   is it necessary always to continue such? The wrath of God can never be
   directed against any creature but as he is wicked. But then his word
   saith, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon
   him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon." Isaiah lv. 7.

   But you may perhaps say, "I am a wicked creature, and this is the thing
   I dread, that I shall be always so, I cannot alter the state of my own
   case, I cannot mend myself; this is that therefore, which makes me
   stand in dread."

   Why, to that I shall shortly say, either you desire to be other than
   you are, or you do not; either you desire, of a wicked creature, to be
   made holy, godly and righteous, or you do not desire this. If you do
   desire it, and you say, this is the object of your dread, that you
   shall never be other than a wicked creature, because you cannot mend
   yourself; why dread, (as I told you,) carries hatred in the nature of
   it, and hatred of wickedness. If you dread this continuance in
   wickedness, you hate it. But I would fain know, if it be possible to
   desire and hate the same thing. Do you desire and choose to be always
   wicked, and yet hate and dread to be so? These are inconsistent: what
   you say now, overthrows itself. It is impossible for you to desire to
   be always what you are, if you really dread, that is, hate that state
   of wickedness wherein you are. If that be the matter of your dread, (as
   it ought to be) then you do hate to be what you are, and you desire to
   be what you are not. Then pursue this apprehension further, a little,
   "I am a wicked creature, and I desire to be otherwise than I am, I
   dread myself, I hate myself as I am such: then I do desire to be such
   as God would have me to be, that is, a holy creature, and one conformed
   to his holy nature and will;" and if this be the posture of your soul
   in reference to yourself, and your own state Godward, you very well
   know what he hath declared of his readiness to accept such. When we
   confess our sins, with self-loathing, self-indignation, self-judging,
   "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins: and the blood of Jesus
   Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." And when we judge ourselves,
   we shall not be judged. He never condemns that man that condemns
   himself, not notionally, but inwardly, with a concomitant hatred and
   loathing, which is somewhat else than the notion of the state and frame
   wherein you find yourself. But now, if you suppose that God will have
   no mercy upon such a one, that is to make a supposition to yourself of
   somewhat in the notion of God that is repugnant to the known notions of
   him: that is, as he is the God of all grace; as he is love itself, and
   as he hath told us this to be his name, "The Lord, the Lord God,
   gracious and merciful, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin." But
   if you have such notions of him, that he will abandon and throw away a
   self-loathing and self-judging creature, and one that desires nothing
   in all this world so much as to please him, this is to create to
   yourself a formidable idol, instead of the true and living God; there
   is no such God as you imagine to yourselves. As an idol is nothing in
   the world, so is this nothing but your own idol, which is a nullity.
   There is no such God; but you create to yourselves such a formidable
   idol, and then hate him, You call that God, which is but of your own
   making, your own creature. But take God as he is in himself, and as he
   hath revealed and reported himself to be, the God of all grace, whose
   name this is, (and his name doth express his nature,) the name that he
   hath made himself known by, "The Lord, the Lord God, gracious:" take
   this true notion of God, and set it before your eyes, and consider,
   "though I be an object of hate, sure I have now before mine eyes an
   Object of the highest love." Is not this an Object of love, a fit
   Object, the most deserving Object, the most amiable Object that can be
   thought? Conceive of him so; and let that be your apprehensions of him,
   till you find hi& love gradually work itself into your souls, and
   transforming and changing you. And if you come once to this perceiving
   and believing this love, you have a love begotten and wrought in you,
   then God and you are happily met. Love and love, cannot but unite and
   dwell together, and will everlastingly co habit and dwell together. But
   if you say, you are a wicked creature, and you desire to be always what
   you are; if wickedness and you are inseparable, as they can only be by
   the union of your will with wickedness, then are misery and you united
   too, and can only be so by your adherence in heart and will to
   wickedness; and so you will be your own hell, and an everlasting
   fountain of misery to yourself; but God and his throne will be
   guiltless for ever, for he never hates a creature as a creature; his
   wrath can never reach you, but as you are one that continues in a will
   to be wicked.

   But if you can truly say, "I would be otherwise, only I fear, God will
   not help me." Why! hath he not said, he will give his Spirit to them
   that ask him? You are to take heed of forming a notion of God against
   his word; for he can have no will against his word: it is impossible he
   should. There can be no counsel of the divine will that contradicts his
   plain word. Therefore, take heed of imagining any such thing to
   yourselves.

   And so, upon the whole matter, there is place for that counsel, as what
   we are to resolve to live and die by, that is, never to entertain a
   slavish dread concerning our own eternal concernments. But consider how
   the distinguishing characters are given in Scripture, between them that
   are saved, and them, that finally perish. And if you find the present
   characters upon you that mark you out for hell and damnation, only say,
   "I am such and such now, but it is not necessary that I should always
   be what I am." Sin is not you, and you are not sin; they are separable,
   these are partable things: and only implore that grace and help of the
   Divine Spirit that is offered, suitable to the estate of lost and
   apostate creatures. And never entertain any despairing thought but that
   that Spirit shall be given when it is seriously asked and sought after,
   and desired by you: the state of no man's case can exclude such
   considerations as these, for while there is any thing of sense about a
   man's eternal concernments, though it be from common grace, it is from
   the Spirit of grace, for all grace is from that Spirit, and that common
   grace may be gradually leading on to special grace, if it be duly
   complied with.

   So that there is still no cause for a slavish dread: that soul is not
   quite abandoned and given up by God, in which remains any concern about
   its future state, and about its case God ward. You are not, indeed, to
   ascribe it to your own. nature, if you are so solicitous about the
   divine favour, if you are not so swallowed up in this world, and
   immersed in sensuality, as to have all thoughts excluded about your
   soul-affairs, and your everlasting concernments, You are not to
   arrogate this to yourself; for we are not sufficient of ourselves to
   think a good thought: and there is a good tendency in those thoughts;
   and therefore, all this ought to be ascribed to the Divine Spirit that
   is now, some way or other, at work with you; and those workings of his,
   have a leadingness and tendency in them to move to further and higher
   workings, which accordingly you are to expect with hope, and so to lay
   aside a slavish dread accompanied with despair, with utter despair that
   ever things shall he better with you.

   (7.) And then, as to all your other concernments, intrust them freely
   and cheerfully to this God. He that worketh all things after the
   counsel of his own will; how complete an Object of trust is he! Whose
   heart would misgive him, who trusteth him that worketh all things after
   the counsel of his own will? Can the counsel of his own will, can the
   counsel of that will which is guided by unerring wisdom, ever hurt any
   body? Will any body be the worse for lying under the determination of
   that will, which is guided by unerring counsel? Never fear to trust
   him, in all things, who bears this character; a cheerful trust, a
   delightful trust, is most suitable to this representation of God. Never
   fret, never tumultuate, never admit of any distrustful thought; but at
   the same time, (as the direction is, Psalm xxxvii., beginning.) "Trust
   in the Lord and do good." and place your delight in the Lord, and not
   fret at any thing we see fall out in the world, never fret but trust,
   never fret but do good, never fret, but delight thyself in the Lord.
   And therefore,

   (8.) Lastly; The direction that is most suitable to this apprehension
   of God, is to preserve a continual quietude and tranquillity in our own
   spirits. The proper effect of such trust is quietness: a His heart is
   fixed, trusting in the Lord.'' And, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect
   peace, whose mind is staid on thee: because he trusteth in thee."
   Isaiah xxvi. 3. There is no room, nor place for rational disquiet
   hereupon, in reference to any thing he hath done, or in reference to
   any thing we may apprehend he will do. Let there be such a constant
   calmness and tranquillity of spirit maintained, in opposition to
   vexation, about past events; and to solicitude about future events: for
   these two things, we are apt to disquiet ourselves: about past events,
   with vexation; and future events, with solicitude: and so we live
   uncomfortable lives. But there will be no place left, either for the
   one or the other, if we will but carry this apprehension about us, that
   God worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. What cause
   then, can there be for solicitude? God will not change his nature, he
   will be still the same. He will as much govern the world by counsel in
   all future times, and all the particular concernments of his creatures,
   and especially our own concernments, in respect of which we are apt to
   be solicitous. He will do as much as ever he did. For this is his
   essential character, and therefore, can never cease to be so, that he
   doth all things after the counsels of his own will.

   But you may say, "He may permit wicked men to do so and so,
   injuriously."

   If he do so, he wisely permits it, and according to the counsel of his
   own will. And who would be afraid of the counsel of such a will? If lie
   permit ill things to be done and fall out in the world, it is either
   for the exercise of their graces who belong to him in the world, and
   who are the called according to his purpose; it is that their faith,
   and their love to him, and their patience, and their subjection, and
   their heavenly mindedness, and the raisedness of their spirits above
   the world, may be more tried, and may further appear: or, it may be,
   for the correction and chastisement of his own offending people. And
   then, there is no place for fretting and inquietude of spirit, but
   calmly to accept the punishment of sin, lying down under it with a calm
   and submissive patience. Or, it may be in reference to the future, more
   illustrious display of his own glory, that he lets wicked men prosper
   and triumph for a time, and flourish like the green grass, when it is
   that they may be destroyed for ever. And never doubt but that he doth
   all things after the counsel of his own will, he will make all things
   finally to result into such an end as shall be suitable to so glorious
   an Agent, worthy of himself, so that angels and saints shall confess to
   all eternity, that all his ways and works were marvellous, just,
   righteous and great; and worthy of himself, taken altogether. It cannot
   but be so, that the issue of things must be such as is most agreeable
   to him "who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."

II. God's Work of Creation
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE IX. [23]

   Heb. xi. 3.

   Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by
   the word of God, so that things which are seen, were
   not made of things which do appear.

   IN that order of discourse, (wherein we have made some progress,) of
   treating of the several more principal heads of that religion which we
   all profess, we have spoken at large (as the last subject we insisted
   upon in this course) of the counsels of the divine will, or (which is
   all one) his purposes and decrees, according to which he is said to
   work all things, in that, Ephes. i. 11.

   And now, the next thing that comes in order to be spoken of, is that
   great work of creation, which is part, and the first part, the
   beginning of the execution of his external counsels or purposes of his
   will. This is the first of his external acts that terminate upon
   somewhat without himself. His decrees, though they have their term
   within him, and so come into the account, not of his transient, but of
   his eminent acts, and yet do differ, too, from all these internal acts
   of the divine Hypostasis towards one another; for they have their very
   objects in the Divine Being. But the decrees of God, though they have
   their term within the Divine Being, that is, they do, while they are
   but decrees, effect nothing extra Deum, without God, yet they have
   their object without him; that is, they refer, some way or other, to
   the creature. Now, in contradistinction to those internal acts of God
   that have reference to the creature, we consider his external acts,
   whereof this of creation is the first, and is leading and fundamental
   to all other subsequent and external acts of his, towards, or upon, the
   creature, as now existing, till some act or other hath preceded, by
   which it might exist.

   This is, therefore, such an act as makes its object, and doth not
   suppose it; as all following acts of God towards the creature do
   suppose the object, and not make it; suppose it preexistent, and then
   are concerned and conversant about it, as already existent; to wit, to
   sustain it, to regulate it, improve it, perfect it; or any ways alter
   it as he sees good.

   And whereas, this is the first step that God takes in executing the
   counsels of his will; that is, that being ascribed to him, to do all
   things according to the counsel of his will, he doth this great work of
   creation, according to that counsel of his will. This will put an end
   to the great dispute about the original of all things; whether this
   world, and all that it contains came, of itself, or by fate, or by
   chance; or whether it were all entirely owing to some wise and
   designing intelligent Agent. If, I say, the authority of divine
   Revelation may decide the matter, and so far obtain in the minds of
   men, there is an end of that dispute; that is, that since whatsoever is
   done by that great and almighty Agent, was done according to the
   counsels of his own will; then this world came not into being of
   itself, or by any fatality or casualty; but by wise counsel designing
   the thing, and the time, and whatsoever circumstances might refer there
   unto.

   And, indeed, those that have not a divine Revelation to guide their
   apprehension in this matter, and have but allowed themselves (as many
   have) a liberty of thought, have discerned those characters of divine
   wisdom and design, in the whole frame and contrivance of things in this
   great creation, as not only to acknowledge, but to adore the wise
   Creator that hath given being to all. Every thing of order, being the
   product of wisdom; wisdom and order have most certain relation to one
   another, as the productive principle, and the object produced. If there
   be such a thing as order produced, wisdom and counsel must have been
   the productive principle.

   We, formerly, in the beginning of this series of discourse, had
   occasion to speak of the creation, from Romans i. 20. The invisible
   things of God, even his eternal power and Godhead, are clearly seen in
   the things that he hath made. It was upon another account that we
   discoursed of the creation then; not making that the terminative
   subject of our discourse; but considered it only as evidential of the
   Deity; we are now to consider it as effected by that almighty, divine
   power: we now consider it as a matter of faith. "By faith we understand
   that the worlds were framed by the word of God." And it was of absolute
   necessity that there should be that rational consideration of the
   creation, first, in order to the evincing of an object of faith, before
   we came to speak any thing of faith, or what was to be matter of faith;
   for no one can believe any thing, by the proper assent of faith, till
   he understands who he is to believe, and why. And it is the formal
   object of faith that we were to evince to you, in order to our shewing
   the ground why we were to believe any material object that comes within
   the compass of divine Revelation.

   Therefore, having first evinced to you the existence and being of God;
   and then, evidenced to you, that that Revelation which we have in the
   Book of Scripture is from God; and thence having more distinctly
   considered the nature and perfections of God, as they are held forth in
   that Revelation, together with the distinct Hypostasis which that
   Revelation assures us are in the Deity; we now come to consider the
   creation too, as a matter of faith also.

   And it ought not to seem strange to us, that when we have heard the
   creation spoken of, as tending to evince to us the being of God, we
   should come now to discourse of it as a matter of faith; for most plain
   it is, that the same conclusion may be assented to on different
   grounds, and the one doth strengthen the other, and not detract from
   it. It is no prejudice at all to our receiving the doctrine of the
   creation, as a matter of faith, that it is also demonstrable in a
   rational way, any more than it doth detract from, or lessen the credit
   of, a human testimony that many do concur and say the same thing; which
   detracts nothing from the validity of that person's testimony, but
   instead of that, adds thereto.

   And we are to reckon it a great discovery of the divine favour and
   indulgence to us, when one and the same thing may be the matter, both
   of a fiducial assent upon a divine testimony, and of rational
   demonstration also. God condescends to us, and is so much the more
   favourable, that he is pleased to make the same thing evident more ways
   than one, according as the occurrence of several media for the
   evidencing of any thing, doth beget a stronger and firmer impression of
   the thing itself, upon our minds. This is referred unto, allusively, to
   set forth the great assurance wherewith the gospel Revelation was
   given, 1 John i. 1, 3. "That which we have heard, which we have seen
   with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of
   the word of life--that which we have seen and heard declare we unto
   you."

   It is very true, indeed, that the creation, generally dered, and more
   abstractly, is very demonstrable by reason; not only to be rendered
   probable, or a likely thing, but certain and more demonstrable. That
   is, as I said, when we have in view so many sorts of things that we are
   sure were not always; and therefore, could not be of themselves; (for
   whatsoever is of itself must be always, must be from eternity;) then we
   are sure every such thing must have had some maker or other. And so,
   nothing can be more demonstrable, than that there hath been, and must
   be, a creation, even unto reason, and by reason.

   But though reason may clearly apprehend and evince, in general, that
   there hath been a creation, it can never evince the way and manner, the
   method and order, wherein things have been created. All this must be
   owing to divine Revelation, and to faith thereupon, if we understand,
   (as here it is said,) "through faith, the worlds were framed, by the
   word of God." By reason, we may know that the world or worlds were some
   time or other made: but we can only know by faith that they were made
   in six days, and that such and such was the order of making them, as
   the divine history doth report the matter to us. And therefore, doth
   this text inform us, not only of this as an apprehensible thing, that
   the worlds were made, but it lets us see how we are to apprehend it. We
   are not only to understand this, but we are to understand it by faith,
   that the worlds were framed by the word of God.

   We have, in the text, two distinct propositions, which are of two
   divers kinds; the first is dogmatical, or more expressly assertory, and
   the second is explicatory of the former.

   The former, I say, is mere dogmatical. "By faith we understand that the
   worlds were framed by the word of God." It is a thing to be understood
   by faith, that the worlds were framed by the word of God, And this, I
   shall make the main subject of my discourse which I intend upon this
   scripture.

   The latter is explicatory of the former, so that things which are seen,
   were not made of things that do appear, or were made, (which is the
   truer reading of the text,) of things which do not appear, or were made
   of not appearing things, not preexisting things, that had stood forth
   into being before.

   First. And for the first of these: you see it contains two parts--what
   it is we are to understand; and--how we are to understand it.--The
   thing to be understood, that the worlds were framed by the word of
   God,--and how we are to under stand it, by faith: or through faith. It
   is faith that lets in the notion the more distinctly into our minds. We
   have this notion by faith, as the word in the greek signifies, the
   forming of a notion, begetting it in our minds. We have the notion
   begot in our minds by faith, that the worlds were so framed by the word
   of God.

   1. We have first, and more principally, to consider the former of
   these, the thing to be understood. We shall consider the manner
   afterwards. And for the thing to be understood, that the worlds were
   framed by the word of God, we have here three heads of discourse more
   distinctly to be considered and spoken to--the object of this act, the
   worlds--the Agent whose this act or work is, that is, God, exerting his
   power by his word, and--the act of creation itself, what kind of act
   that is. It is here rendered, "framed." We shall speak to the emphasis
   of that expression hereafter, in its proper place, when we come to give
   you an account of the nature of the act, creating, which though that
   word doth not primarily and directly signify, yet supposeth, as we
   shall in a proper time come to shew you.

   (1.) We are to consider the object of creation, as it is here expressed
   by this comprehensive term, the worlds, "The worlds were framed by the
   word of God." The word, here, so rendered, doth signify sometimes
   eternity, especially being plurally used. But sometimes also it
   signifies time, and sometimes an age, and in the plural, ages. But it
   doth also signify, in the narrower sense, time: not only time, in
   itself, abstractly and nakedly considered, but the things that lie
   within time: not the mensura but the mensurata, not only that duration,
   which is the measure of such and such things, but the things themselves
   that are measured thereby. And that is the sense wherein it must be
   taken here. Therefore, it is not the naked thing, time, that is spoken
   of here, (though the word, sometimes, hath that signification as the
   object of this creative act,) but all things that come under temporary
   mensuration, all that are measured by time, which is fitly enough
   expressed in our translation by this term, "the worlds."

   And whereas, it is not said, world, but worlds, that shews, that the
   continens is more than one: and if the propriety of the greek be
   considered, it also signifies them to be more than two; for the word is
   not a dual but a plural, and so it is more than one, and more than two
   worlds that are signified by this expression. And indeed, the matter is
   less indefinite; and it being impossible to us to know how many are the
   several circles of things that are above us, that are all made things,
   things altogether without our knowledge or comprehension, (as we have
   had occasion to tell you on another account, of our Lord's being
   ascended, and gone up far above all heavens,) we are left in a just
   uncertainty, (which belongs to us, and is proper to our state,) how
   many those heavens are, or those orbs of things which are replenished
   with creatures, (parts of the universe,) that altogether make the
   entire object of this creation, and this great creative act.

   And taking that phrase, "the worlds," to signify whatsoever lies under
   the measure of time, so we are not barely to consider such orbs, but we
   are to take in all the contenta, as well as the continens, all the
   things contained, as well as the things containing. And so, it is the
   whole universe of created beings that comes under our present
   consideration: which, therefore, in speaking to us of the object of the
   creation, or what it is that is created, it is not to be imagined that
   we should speak of it in the singular, nor of all the particular kinds;
   but only under some general heads, into which the universe of created
   things may be distributed.

   [1.] The first, and most general and obvious distribution of the
   created universe, is into the more substantial things, and the
   modifications thereof; what is in itself a substantial thing, and what
   doth only some way or other modify such a being. And it is the former
   of these, that is the proper object; creation more strictly and
   properly taken. Creation is, in the strictest sense, suppositorium of
   supposita, of things that do subsist not of themselves, in reference to
   any efficient cause: for so no created thing doth exist, by itself, in
   opposition to what doth inhere, so as to be a subject of things that do
   reside in it. And so, the modification of things are not properly
   created in the strictest sense of creation; but are educed and brought
   forth out of those substantial beings that were themselves created, or
   made out of nothing; and so they, that is, substantial things, are the
   most proper objects of creation, that have a proper subsistence of
   their own, though with dependance on the efficient Cause that gave them
   being. And after this distribution, comes,

   [2.] The distribution of such created things, that is, substantial
   beings, in which all the diversifying modi do reside and have their
   place, And we are to consider what may be the more general distribution
   of substantial things, that are themselves created. And we can consider
   none more general, than this one, to wit, of all those created
   substances, into these two heads, matter and mind. If the inquiry be,
   What doth this universe of created beings contain? Or what are the
   great spheres of being that lie within the compass of the created
   universe? Why, speaking of substantial things themselves, that are the
   subjects of divers distinct modi or modifications, they can be but
   these two, all will fall under these two heads, to wit, matter and
   mind. And this is that distribution of created things which the
   Scripture gives us a ground express enough for: Col. i. 16. "By him
   were all things made that are in heaven or that are in earth, visible
   and invisible." We may well enough suppose all matter to be, some way
   or other, visible, though, there be indeed a finer sort of matter than
   is visible to us. But then, there is the other head of things, in that
   Col. i. 16. things that are simply invisible, altogether invisible, as
   it is altogether impossible that any sense, any external sense, can
   perceive a mind, or a thought, which is the immediate product of that
   mind. So, that every distribution of created things into visible and
   invisible, I take it, sufficiently corresponds with this that I now
   mention, that is, matter and mind.

   And otherwise, we have the creation distinguished as to the object of
   it, or creation, passively taken, into heaven and earth, as we find in
   that history of the beginning of the creation, Gen. i. 1. "In the
   beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Some, indeed, that go
   to the cabalistical way, will have by heavens, all intellectual beings
   that are created, to be comprehended and meant: and by earth, all
   matter whatsoever. We shall not dispute the propriety of that
   conjecture, or what probably it hath, or hath not; but take what is
   more obvious to ourselves in common understanding. And if we take that
   as a distribution of created things, heaven and earth, as was intimated
   before, we must comprehend together both the continens and the
   contenta. And so, by heaven, must be understood and meant, not only all
   the several superior orbs, but all their inhabitants that do reside and
   dwell in them, and wherewith they are replenished, and unto which, our
   very minds and spirits, (though now they are clothed with terrestrial
   vehicles and dwell in flesh,) do originally appertain and belong, as
   being nearer of kin. and more allied to the world of spirits than they
   are allied to this world of flesh and earth, this terrestrial world.
   For, if we fake the mind and spirit in us, to be the nobler and more
   excellent part of ourselves, taking our denomination from that which is
   more noble and excellent, we have greater affinity, according to our
   primitive and original state, with heaven, than we have with earth,
   which affinity is not to be judged by the place of residence, but by
   the nature of the thing. Mind and spirit are more akin to heavenly
   inhabitants, than they are to any thing that is made merely of earth.

   And so, taking the things contained, with all the heavenly orbs, you
   have great diversifications, in that mentioned place, Col. i. 16. And
   there indeed, the Spirit of God runs out more than it doth in the
   distribution of things that fall under that other head, that is, the
   visible things of this earth. For we are told, under the head of
   invisible things, (and which also in very great part, indeed, are the
   things which do belong to the heavens,) of thrones and dominions, and
   principalities and powers; which are very reasonably thought to mean so
   many several orders of celestial creatures that do inhabit the other
   world or worlds, for Low many of them there are, we do not know, nor
   can know; as we formerly told you.

   And then, if we speak of the things contained in this lower orb,
   signified here by earth, they do more generally fall under a common
   notice, and are more obvious to every one's apprehension. This world,
   you know, is replenished with very numerous sorts of creatures that
   live one way or other, or with one or another sort of lives; either,
   that do live an intellectual life, or live from an intelligent soul, as
   we do all live; or else, that live a merely sensitive life, as all the
   brute creatures do, of that next order below, or else, things that do
   live a merely vegetative life; as all the several sorts of plants that
   have some kind of life, though it be of a meaner and lower kind.

   And then, there are all your inanimate things that have no proper life
   at all; that is, have no self-moving or self-acting principle within
   them, or peculiar to them, from whence they do act or order themselves,
   or are capable of being moved, as from any internal v is in this kind
   or that.

   Of such extent is this created universe: it takes in all these several
   sorts of things. And to descend to the enumeration of more particular
   kinds would be an endless work, and not proper for us. But, in the mean
   time, we have very great amplitude in the object of our present thought
   and consideration, when we are to look upon the universe of created
   beings, that is, of created substances, look upon all those that come
   under the notion of matter, and that, as such, is inanimate: matter, as
   matter, has no self-moving principle in it. Look upon all those things
   that live some kind of life or another; whether they be things of this
   earth of ours, or whether they be things of the superior or refined
   orbs and parts of the universe: these come in all the orders of
   angelical creatures of which we have only that general and more
   indistinct account which that Colossians i. and some other passages of
   Scripture give us. What their diversifications are, we know not; but
   some or other they are, and such as do import superiority and
   inferiority among themselves. And then, go to that other head, of
   things destitute of life, and that more properly come under the notion
   of matter beforementioned: and so, descending down wards from the more
   noble and excellent creatures, to the meaner and lesser ones, what a
   vast scale of created being is this! descending from the highest to the
   lowest, or ascending from the lowest to the highest, and all within the
   compass of the created universe, and all this signified by that one
   expression in the text "the worlds."

   Indeed, all this being summed up into this one expression, of the
   universe or the world, taken singularly and in the largest sense of
   which it doth admit, we have, even within the compass of created
   beings, that which far exceeds any of our thoughts. And it hath been a
   question, much agitated, amongst philosophical men, whether the created
   universe have any created limits at all, yea or no. It hath been
   agitated by some with a very ill design: and some have made it their
   business, in moving the controversy, to hide their design. And with a
   strange mixture of fraud and folly, in discussing that question,
   Whether the created universe were infinite or no? they have gone about
   to disguise the matter, and told us, they would not, indeed, say it was
   infinite, but it was indefinite; to wit, the extent of the created
   universe: and by the extent of it, the meaning could not be the mere
   local extent, but the real; not barely what space it took it up, but
   what of essence and real being it did comprehend and contain; and that,
   some of them have told us, was not infinite, but indefinite only.

   But there hath been a very great mixture (as I say) of fraud and of
   folly: of fraud, that they have disguised their meaning, and laboured
   to hide it: and of folly, that in their very attempt of hiding it, they
   have unawares discovered a very ill meaning. And it could not but be
   so; for when the terms are distinguished of infinite and indefinite, I
   would fain know what they mean by the latter. If, by indefinite, they
   mean that which hath in itself no certain limits, then they plainly
   say, it is infinite, the created universe is infinite, because it hath
   no certain, limits. But if they mean by it only, that it hath no known
   limits to us, that every one readily acknowledged: we can never know
   the limits of it; and so that is but to say it is finite, if they mean
   only so. And indeed, it is a very dubitable thing, whether any finite
   understanding can measure the created universe, or is capable of
   comprehending the extent of it. Very willing I am to aggrandize that as
   much a I can, in consistency, still, with owning it to be but a created
   thing; because still, the more we magnify that, the more we magnify the
   Creator. But to pretend it to be an indefinite thing in that sense,
   that is, that it hath no certain limits in itself, that is to make it
   an infinite thing.

   And if it here be inquired. What is the inconvenience of that, to make
   it to be so, or how can we prove it not to be so? Why truly, to the
   former of the questions, there would be this to say, that to say it
   were infinite, or could be infinite, were to say that it were not a
   creation: for most certain it is, whatsoever is infinite is God.
   Infinity is the proper predicate or attribute of Deity. And so, the
   inconvenience would be, the taking away all the foundations of
   religion; for it would be the confounding of God and the creature, the
   taking away the difference between them. And it would be equally
   impossible, that there should be any room or place for religion, if you
   take away the subject of it, as much as if you take away the Object of
   it. If the creature were infinite, there could be no subject of
   religion: and there can be no place for religion, if there be no
   subject of it, any more than if there were no Object of it.

   And as to the question, How can it be proved that the created universe
   is not infinite, and cannot be infinite? It is very clearly to be
   proved by what hath been said, in very great part: that is, whatsoever
   is infinite is God. Therefore, to say that the created universe is
   infinite, is to say, that it is not created. But besides, it may be
   easily evinced, that not only this universe of created beings is not
   infinite but that it is impossible that it ever should be, or could be.
   And as the plain reason of the thing doth lie against that imagination;
   so, the most pernicious and destructive tendency of that philosophy
   that would impose upon us the imagination of an infinite universe, is
   most studiously to be disclaimed and abhorred, as taking away all place
   and room for religion. For it would confound created being and
   uncreated, and deify the creature, and so, leave no subject of worship,
   as the more avowed atheism leaves no Object of it.

   I shall not say more to you about the object of this said act. We are
   further to consider the great Agent, the Creator: and the nature of the
   act of creation. But let us make some stand and pause here, and
   consider what improvement is to be made of what hath been thus far
   discoursed to you. It is of very vast extent, what we are to consider
   under the notion of the created universe. But when all this is done, it
   is still but a creation; make it as great a thing as you will, magnify
   it as much as possible, consistently with its being a creation, and
   when all this is done, then say within yourselves, "All this is but as
   a drop, a drop of a bucket, a dust in a balance, a mere nothing, yea,
   lighter than nothing and vanity, compared with that Being which is of
   itself; that Being which owes itself to none; that Being to which it
   was impossible not to be; for ail this vast creation doth but depend on
   will and pleasure; "For thy pleasure they are and were created." It was
   determinable, merely upon good pleasure, whether there should be any
   creation, or no creation: so that one nutus, one nod (as I may speak)
   of the Divine Mind, either makes this vast thing, the whole created
   universe, to be something or nothing. "If I please, it shall be
   something, if I please, it shall be nothing."

   It should lead us into adoration of the great self-subsisting Being,
   that owes it to none that he is, is beholden to none, but is by the
   excellency of his own eternal nature, to which it was repugnant not to
   be, and which comprehends all plenitude and fulness of being in itself,
   even an infinitude of being.

   Consider this then, and when it hath prompted and led you into
   admiration and adoration, looking up to the great Creator, it should
   prompt and lead us into the greatest detestation of the insolency of
   creatures, even such creatures as (if they would use their minds) are
   capable of apprehending this, and yet take upon them as if they were
   absolute. They started up out of being but the other day, and at the
   fiat, and by the pleasure, of the great Creator; and now, they look
   upon themselves in this world as if it were all theirs, and as if they
   might do in it what they pleased. He that is the Creator of heaven and
   earth is also, we know, in Scripture, stiled the Possessor of heaven
   and earth. And for a company of upstart creatures sprung up into being
   but the other day, to take upon them, as if they were possessors (as
   much as is possible for them to grasp) of this creation, and to do in
   it what they will; what a detestable insolency is this! It is but a
   dependant, borrowed right that any one hath in whatsoever he calls his
   own. And yet, men are apt to hug themselves in conceit of propriety,
   saying, "This is my own land, these are my own goods, this is my own
   house: and it is so by the best title a man can have." Now suppose a
   stranger enter your door and come into your house and take no notice of
   any thing as yours, but useth all things as he pleaseth, and saith he
   will do what he lists in this house of yours; or (without saying so)
   doth what he lists, takes and uses what he will, and as he will, would
   you not take yourself to be highly injured, and would you not right
   yourself, if it lay in your power, upon so injurious an intruder as
   this? Why, at this rate is the great God treated and dealt with, by his
   apostate, revolted creatures, inhabiting this lower world, though it be
   even the meaner and baser parts of his creation? Creatures sprung up
   into being here by indulgence of divine favour, take upon them as if
   they were their own lords and owners, and as if every thing they lay
   their hands on were their own, without ever taking notice of God; He
   that gave them breath and being and all things, that they might seek
   after him, and consider, "Whence come I? and all things that I use and
   enjoy, whence are they?" No such thing enters into their minds, from
   day to day, but a life's time is run out in these bodies, wherein they
   should love, and serve, and adore, their great Creator, without taking
   notice of him.

   But a more copious use of this yet remains, when we shall have opened
   other things that yet are to be doctrinally opened unto you.

LECTURE X. [24]

   (2.) We are now, in the second place, to consider the Agent in this
   great and mighty work, and that is, (as the text expresseth it,) God
   himself, that great, all-comprehending Name. There will be occasion to
   take notice of the way of his agency, (by his word,) by and by. The
   Creator of all things, of heaven and earth, can be no other than he who
   comprehends and contains all things, virtually, in his own power. But
   whereas, we have heretofore shewn to you at large, that there is in the
   Deity a threefold subsistence, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,
   they are each of them to be comprehended under the notion of Creator
   here. It is a plain and self-evident truth, commonly given us as a
   maxim, Opera Trinitatis, ad extra, sunt indivisa, vel communicabla;
   that the works of the three persons in the Godhead towards the creature
   are undivided, and communicable to each of the persons; so as that we
   must understand them to be conjunct, in every such act as they do exert
   without themselves or towards any thing that is not God. Their
   distinguishing actions are towards one another; but the actings that
   they exert towards any thing without them, these are common to them
   all. So that the Father creates, the Son creates, and the Holy Ghost
   creates. This action which, as we have told you, makes its object, and
   doth not suppose it, as other acts, ad extra, do, it is the common act
   of each of these. And so you find that the creation is usually ascribed
   to God, under that name of God (that name, being essentially taken)
   which comprehends all the three persons. And so we must understand
   that, in the beginning of Genesis, where God is said to have created
   the heavens and the earth. And that observation is not to be slighted,
   that Elohim, a plural noun is conjoined with a verb of the singular
   number; Barah Elohim. As if it were said, Gods created the heaven and
   the earth; that is, it is an expression to note that there is a
   plurality in the Deity; that is, of persons, each of which is God. But
   it being conjoined with a verb in the singular number, it shews that
   these three were but one; did agree in Deity, as well as in this
   creative act. And this is that which that learned man Zanchy, in his
   treatise, "De tribus Elohim," doth prove profitably and at large. But
   more particularly, when the name of God is taken,

   [1.] Personally, as divers times also it is, then it signifies,
   eminently, God the Father: and that very term doth sufficiently express
   him to be the Original of all things, of all beings, both created and
   uncreated. He is usually, and fitly enough, said to be Fons Deitatis et
   fons Trinitatis. The Deity is first in the Father, and all created
   beings first and originally from him, as the matter is plainly
   expressed in the 1 Cor. viii. 6. To us there is but one God the Father,
   of whom are all things. Him we are taught to adore as the great
   Original, from whom all being hath its rise. And yet,

   [2.] We have the creation, very frequently, ascribed to the Son,
   speaking him conjunct with the Father in this great creative act. And
   even in that last mentioned place, (1 Cor. viii.) where it is said, "To
   us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things and we in
   him," it is added, "and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things,
   and we by him." And so, in that Col. i. 15, 16. his agency in the
   creation is most expressly asserted. He who is there said to be "the
   image of the invisible God, and the first-born," (as we read it, but it
   may as properly be read, according to grammar, with only the alteration
   of an accent, the first-begotten of every creature,) "by him were all
   things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
   invisible; whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or
   powers, all things were created by him and for him." There is his
   concurrence and conjunction with the Father, both as the efficient and
   final Cause of all things. So that Heb. i. 2. "God hath in these last
   days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed the heir of all
   things, by whom also he made the worlds." He that is "the brightness of
   his Father's glory and the express image of his person," by him the
   worlds were made. And so we have it, most expressly, in the beginning
   of John's gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
   God, (a known name and title of Christ, God's eternal Son and
   consubstantial Word) that Word was in the beginning with God, and that
   Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
   made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." He
   is spoken of under a title of like import, frequently, in other
   scriptures, and most expressly in Proverbs viii. That is, by the name
   of the wisdom of God, and, under that name, is asserted to be with him,
   even through out the whole work of this creation. Not with him in an
   idle concomitancy: which no man can understand, either according to the
   reason of the thing, or the plain import of the other scriptures that
   have been named, and many more that are to be named. He was with him,
   when the Lord laid the foundations of the earth, when he stretched out
   the heavens, when he did all that was done in the work of creation. And
   then,

   [3.] The creation is ascribed to the Eternal Spirit, to the Holy Ghost,
   as you find expressly in that Gen. 1. when we had been told, t( In the
   beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and that the earth was
   without form and void; the Spirit of God is said to have moved upon the
   face of the waters:" that is, upon the fluid matter of the yet unformed
   chaos, that profound abyss; that Tohu and Bohu, as it is expressed;
   upon that fluid and yet unformed matter that was fluctuating, even as
   waters do: upon that, the Spirit of God did move to collect and form
   things out of it, according to divine pleasure.

   Thus, it is plain, each person in the Godhead hath his hand and part in
   this great work of creation. What hand and part each hath, some are
   very curious in describing. But so far as the Scriptures expressly do
   lead us, so far we may allow our conceptions to be formed concerning
   their distinct agency. And it is plain,

   First: That the name Father doth signify him to be the Original of all
   things, the first Fountain Being, the Fountain of all being, created
   and uncreated. The Divine Being itself is first and originally in Him,
   as the name Father signifies: and that comprehends the fulness of all
   being in itself, all excellency, all perfection whether conceivable by
   us, or unconceivable. So from him, the creation must have taken its
   rise as the Head of all things. And then,

   Secondly: The Scripture speaks of the Son under the name of the eternal
   consubstantial word of God, or his essential wisdom, which must needs
   be understood to contain in itself the first idea of all things. All
   being originally contained and comprehended in God the Father as such,
   he is now said to be the image of the invisible God, and in him do all
   the glories of the Deity shine, as in their first image. All things
   being to be created and produced into actual being according to that
   image which lay in the Divine Mind, which he is. As there is no one
   goes about to make any thing, but hath the image and idea in his own
   mind, first, of what he intends to make. He that intends to make a
   book, or to make a house, or a garment, hath the idea in his own mind,
   first, of what he intends to make, and according to that idea all
   things are made. All things that were to be created, the eternal wisdom
   of the Father comprehending them all in himself, he is the rule or
   norma, according to which; the creation is at last produced into actual
   being. And then,

   Thirdly: The agency of the Holy Ghost may be conceived according to
   that light the Scripture gives concerning the distinguishing characters
   of that person. From the actuous love, between the Father and the Son,
   for an eternal production of the divine image by the Father in the Son,
   there cannot but be an everlasting spiration of love between the Father
   and this, his consubstantial Image: an actuous love, and that image,
   containing in itself the ideas of all the things that were to be
   produced. This mighty power of actuous love, it goes forth to produce
   all things, according to this image, with the highest delectation and
   complacency, according to which, God pronounced concerning all things
   which he had made--that it was very good, and so a derivative object of
   divine love; all things being produced according to that excellency of
   his own image that was the Original Root of all things. And hereupon,
   do other scriptures speak of the agency of the Holy Ghost in this
   matter; that is, that by his Spirit he garnished the heavens; one part
   of the creation there spoken of. "Thou sendest forth thy Spirit and
   they are created." Psalm civ. 30. And so you see, that Father, Son, and
   Spirit have their parts and agencies in this great work of creation.
   But then,

   (3.) We have here to consider the act itself. You have seen the object,
   the worlds; and you have seen the Agent, God himself, Father, Son, and
   Spirit. We are now next, according to the order proposed, to consider
   the act that is expressed here in the text by a word, which is, fitly
   enough, rendered, "framed;" but we must note unto you, that, that word
   doth express one sort of act, and supposeth another. It expresseth one
   sort of act, that is, the framing of things; framing (as it is fitly
   enough translated here) when there was some what now brought into
   being, out of which, they should be so and so diversly framed,
   especially as to the material part of the world. That is the act here
   expressed. But then, it supposeth a former act, a foregoing act, and
   that is, the making all out of nothing, out of which any thing was
   after framed. We shall speak of the act the word expresseth, first; and
   then shall speak of the act that word supposeth.

   [1.] The word in the text is very fitly expressive of the former act,
   that the worlds are said to be framed. It comes of a word that
   signifies perfect and entire, and it seems to come from that we
   commonly denote by art; or, as some would have, the relation of this
   word to artus which signifies our limbs, the limbs of any creature that
   is endued with life. And so they would borrow the illustration of this
   word from chirurgick art, that doth aptly place the bones which have
   been dislocated, and puts them into joint again. So the worlds were
   framed (as it were) by the most curious and exquisite chirurgick art:
   or else, that which is precedent to that, the locking and joining
   things into one another throughout the whole creation.

   And in this respect, the framing of the worlds was more immediately the
   work of the divine wisdom, which may be meant by the expression here,
   that they were created by the word of God, which I told you we should
   take notice of in its proper place. Which may be meant not of the word
   spoken out, but of the internal word, agreeable to what we are wont to
   call verbum mentis: as there is no one that speaks, (if he speak
   sense,) but he hath in his own mind first, that which he after wards
   expresseth and speaks out. But herein was the wisdom of the Creator
   principally conspicuous; in that beautiful order and frame of things
   that appeared every where throughout this great universe; that there is
   that order that we behold daily among the heavenly bodies, in reference
   to one another and in reference to us; that which, in the 8th psalm,
   you find the Psalmist in so high and holy an adoration of: "When I
   consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,
   which thou hast ordained." It is a great argument of a holy heart, to
   be much in contemplating the divine wisdom that Lath settled every
   thing of that order which is any where to be found in the whole
   creation.

   If you look into this lower world, and consider that, as to what falls
   under our notice, there is every where that correspondency of actives
   to passives, of faculties to objects, as every one that will use
   thoughts may easily discern, the wisdom of the Creator is greatly to be
   adored in it. For think we with ourselves, how great a piece of vanity
   this creation had been, if it had not been so; if there had been
   objects upon which there had been no faculties to exercise: or, if
   there were faculties to be exercised that had no objects; as if there
   were visible things, and no eye to see them; if there were audible
   things, and no ear to hear them. And so, back again, if there were
   eyes, and nothing to be seen; and a faculty of hearing, and no such
   thing as sound. But herein is the admirable contrivance of the divine
   wisdom in this creation manifest, that there is such a correspondency
   throughout, of objects to faculties, of active powers and principles to
   passives.

   And then, in that order that is settled amongst things, there in we
   have the great display of the divine wisdom, there being (as hath been
   often said) that relation between wisdom and order, as between cause
   and effect. Wheresoever there is any of stated, settled order, we may
   be sure there was wisdom to contrive and design it. Stated and settled
   order cannot be a casualty. When we see the contrivance and order that
   are in such a thing as a watch or a clock, and the like, we are
   presently sure that such a thing was not made by chance. And to think
   that such a mighty agency, a mighty power of motion, as was once
   exerted in this creation, should produce things in that orderly frame
   wherein we behold them, without design, without wisdom, is as absurd an
   imagination, as if we should imagine a thousand men, by violent strokes
   with axes and hammers, upon brass or iron, or the like, without any
   design, should produce so many watches, clocks, or any such like
   engines; meaning no such thing.

   Therefore, nothing is more to be wondered at, nor a greater argument of
   the degeneracy of man, or how low his mind is sunk, than that there
   should be any who should go into the account of the more thinking sort
   of men, that yet should make it their business to exclude the power of
   final causes out of the world: as if there were no such thing as a
   final cause, or an end designed, that had any influence at all upon
   this great creation. Whereas, if we consider the several orders and
   sorts of being, how useful the meanest creature, even the inanimate
   part of the creation is, to very great and necessary purposes and ends;
   and when we consider, among those things that have life, how aptly they
   serve for their own purposes, and how aptly every thing in them serves
   their own purpose, that is, to beget and maintain that life, we cannot
   but see the absurdity of that conceit. To look upon the lowest sort of
   living creatures, the mere vegetable creatures; Why are they made with
   roots? but to take hold of the earth from whence by them their
   nutriment is drawn; that those little fibres, without which a leaf
   could not be nourished, should be dispersed every where throughout the
   whole, with so fine a texture as they are? Very well doth Cicero, a
   heathen, speak of nature under the name of the divine art, the art of
   God. And whereas, "Boni artificis est celare artem;" it is the part of
   a good artist to conceal his art, truly, if the divine art were not, in
   great part, concealed, one would think all the actions of intelligent
   creatures, should be swallowed up in wonder, to behold the divine
   agency running through all things, and so variously exerting itself for
   the production of things as we find them; and contriving the several
   kinds of things in the same rank and station in the creation, into
   which at first they were set.

   If we should look to that admirable, rare contrivance, that appears in
   the forming of our own bodies, upon which you find the Psalmist in that
   transport, "Marvellous are thy works, fearfully I am made." that is,
   wonderfully; "and that my soul knoweth right well." Psalm cxxxix. 14.
   That is, "This is a beaten subject to me, a thing that my thoughts are
   much used to, it is a thing about which my mind is accustomed, I know
   it right well:" as we know the path that we have often trod.

   And not only is the divine wisdom conspicuous in this framing of
   things, but his goodness too. How adorable is the goodness of God, even
   in that frame and disposure of things that we find in the creation;
   that things are so framed and adapted, as to answer and correspond to
   one another. Here is a great appearance of the divine goodness, that
   whereas he hath put into such sorts and orders of his creatures, a
   desiring faculty, there is still somewhat in that creation to answer
   that faculty of desire. Every thing is, by natural instinct, taught to
   desire that which is good for it; that is, that which is convenient and
   suitable to it. So we have the Psalmist (psalm cxlv. 15.) admiring God
   upon this account, that the eyes of all things were up unto him, and
   that he gave them their meat in due season: a continual argument and
   testimony of the divine goodness. He hath not left himself, in this,
   without witness; the whole earth is full of his goodness, even that
   which the inhabitants of it replenish and fill with their wickedness
   and malignity against him. He cloth good to all, even to the evil and
   the good. He hears the ravens when they cry, and they seek their meat
   from God: psalm 104. which psalm is full of expressions to this
   purpose. This is the munificence of the great Creator, that when he did
   design to replenish such and such parts of the created universe, with
   such and such inhabitants, creatures able to receive and entertain some
   correspondent and suitable good, he hath also stored the world with
   that good which shall answer every appetite throughout all this
   creation of God: so that none can be miserable, amongst even those that
   are rendered, by their own natures, capable of government by a law, but
   such as make themselves so by aversion and disaffection to their proper
   and suitable good. They only have it not, because they refuse it,
   because they are disaffected thereunto.

   But then, we should come, in the next place, to speak ct the second act
   which this expression in the text doth suppose. That which the word in
   the text is most expressive of, is only that sort of act by which
   things are adapted and suited to one another: but this supposeth a
   former act, by which those things, out of which things are thus framed,
   were themselves at first produced and brought forth out of nothing;
   which is creation in the strictest and most proper sense; though,
   indeed, there is not a word that doth exclusively signify that act in
   any of the learned languages. But the nature of the thing, doth plainly
   evidence that there must be such an act. That is, look upon all
   uncreated being, the being of God himself, and then that which is
   created and made being, must have been made out of nothing; which they
   that will not apprehend, run into various and most manifest
   absurdities; one sort, thinking there must be such a thing as eternal,
   necessary matter; another sort, thinking that things must be made out
   of God as so many parts of the Deity. But I shall, on the next
   occasion, labour to evince to you the absurdity of any such
   imaginations as these.

   And in the mean time, pray let us make so much of present reflection
   upon this great work of God's creation; that is, that he who hath made
   such a world as this, cannot but have both right and ability to rule
   it, and all things in it, to the best and most valuable purposes. And
   truly, I fear we do not, on this account, enough study the creation,
   and the attributes of the Divine Being that are exerted and put forth
   in that creation. There is his wisdom and his goodness to be seen in
   that first sort of act already spoken to.

   And his power is most visible, and especially to be seen in the latter
   sort of act, as we shall shew when we come to speak to it. But to any
   that would give themselves liberty of their own thoughts, one would
   think, they should not part, for all the world, with the consolation,
   that this one thing should afford us: that is, that all this vast frame
   of things should be produced by divine wisdom, goodness, and power,
   into that exquisite order, in which we now behold them: and that,
   hereupon, he that could tell how to make such a world as this,
   replenished with such variety of inhabitants, knows how to govern, and
   dispose every thing he hath made. And, as there hath been that display
   of those glorious excellencies, in the Divine Nature, in the frame and
   contexture of this whole creation, we ought, hereupon, always to
   expect, that he will, with the same wisdom, power, and goodness,
   regulate, govern, and dispose of what he hath so made. All these things
   will appear, and shew themselves in the most proper seasons, without
   our distracting and self-tormenting cares. Let us be desirous,
   principally and finally, of nothing but that he who made such a world
   as this, for himself, and for his own glory, may, in his own way and
   time, have that glory out of it which he seeks and designs for himself.
   Yea, let us be content, that he should have it in such a way as may
   possibly be conjunct with our suffering many inconveniencies; things
   that may be grievous to us, to our flesh and blood, and external sense.
   Should not he have his glory out of his own creation, his own way? This
   world was not made for us, but it was made for him, by whom it was
   made.

LECTURE XI. [25]

   [2.] But then, as I have told you, in the second place, we are now to
   consider, that as the expression, here in the text, doth more directly
   signify that one act, of putting things into order, which is the native
   import of the word; so there is another act necessarily supposed; and
   that is, the bringing of things out of nothing, which are the proper,
   the truly proper matter of production, or whatsoever is extra Deum,
   whatsoever is a diverse thing from the being of the Deity itself. This
   word, "frame," doth not signify directly this act, but it doth
   necessarily suppose it. Order, doth suppose a subject, the things in
   being that are brought into that order. And as the two great attributes
   before mentioned, divine wisdom and goodness, do shine forth in that
   former act, the putting of things into order; so his power doth most
   eminently appear in this latter act, the bringing' of the things which
   he so puts into order, out of nothing.

   As we do not pretend to assert this act, from the import of this word
   that is used in the text, abstractly considered, so neither do we
   pretend to assert, from the native, proper force and significancy of
   any one word at all, that we must think appropriate to this purpose, as
   only to signify this act and nothing else. We do readily grant, the
   hebrew and the greek words thus rendered, are frequently used with more
   latitude than barely to signify the bringing of things out of nothing.
   And so, this act is not to be concluded from the force and import of
   such words, abstractly considered by themselves. Words that are of a
   more indefinite signification, that may signify more things than one,
   they are always determined to some one particular sense or other, by
   the circumstances of the place where they are used. There is not any
   one word at all, that is to be confined and limited to one certain
   sense by its own native import: or, at least, there are very few words
   that are capable of that confinement and restriction by constant and
   unvaried use. But what they mean in this or that saying, is to be
   judged by the circumstances of the discourses wherein they lie.

   What of the creation is de fide a matter of faith merely, we have
   hinted to you already, and shall further have occasion to shew you,
   when we come to speak of that second head, how we are to come to this
   understanding. But, in the mean time, it is very evident, when it is
   said, that we are to understand this by faith, that the worlds were so
   and so framed, we are not to understand it exclusively, as if the
   meaning of the text were to shut out every thing of argument, or
   ratiocination in the matter. One and the same thing may be assented to,
   from divers different premises, as was hinted to you before. It is
   enough for our purpose, and even to make this which I am now speaking
   of, a matter of faith, to wit, the producing of created things out of
   nothing, if it shall evidently appear, that in some texts of Scripture,
   this must be ultimately intended and meant; and that no other thing can
   be, so as to exclude the necessary pre-supposition of this: and there
   are, undoubtedly, some texts that must be so understood, that there
   hath been somewhat produced out of nothing, out of which other things
   at length were made to arise.

   As to that first text of Scripture, "In the beginning God created the
   heaven and the earth." Created, must necessarily have this sense, at
   least, by an unavoidable necessity; for this making heaven and earth,
   being said to be in the beginning, when things took their beginning,
   had their first rise, it must suppose that heaven and earth were not
   only brought into order, but that of which they were made, was made of
   itself to exist, not having existed before. Otherwise, how was that the
   beginning of things? How was that the head of things? as the hebrew
   word Resch, from whence the word Bershith, in the beginning, signifies.
   Otherwise, this word must assert a contradiction, that things were
   begun, and not begun, at that time when God created heaven and earth.

   And so, if you go forward to that first of John's gospel, ver. 2, 3.
   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
   was God. All things were created by him, (that is, God) and without him
   was nothing made that was made:" every thing that was not God, was then
   made: all things. And, therefore, to suppose that all these made things
   were made out of pre-existent matter, is to suppose, that that
   pre-existent matter was riot a thing, for all things were said to be
   made by him. All things beside himself were then made; therefore,
   matter itself was then made, out of which other things were made;
   unless it shall be said that matter is nothing, and, if so, we have
   what we seek, that is, that there are some things made out of nothing;
   but if it were a thing, and were not the Divine Being, as it is
   impossible to be, it was a self-made thing, and then made out of
   nothing.

   And to this purpose must the explicatory proposition in the text be
   necessarily adapted, so that the things that are seen, were not made of
   things that did appear. The phoenomena, (that is the word there) things
   not then appearing, when the worlds were thus framed by the word of
   God; that is, things not before existing, for there is nothing at all
   that can be supposed to exist, but doth appear to some faculty or
   other, either divine or created. But they were things simply not
   appearing at all, and, therefore, not existing at all, out of which
   these worlds were made.

   And lexicographers do take notice of that among the other senses of the
   word phainomenon, that it signifies to exist. And, therefore, the
   worlds are said to be framed out of that which once did not exist, till
   it was made to exist by the divine creative power. And therefore, they
   foolishly think who would put a difficulty upon God in this case, such
   as was put upon the Israelites in Egypt, to make brick without straw:
   as if omnipotency could be posed, or meet with any obstruction to its
   designed acts, for want of matter to work upon. It was all one to him,
   (who calls things that are not, and makes them be as if they were, as
   the expression Rom. iv. 17) whether there were the pre-existent matter
   to work upon or no: and the non preexistence can never nonplus
   omnipotency.

   And therewith should we obviate the vain and idle question, when we
   hear of the worlds being framed by the word of God: "Aye, but of what
   were they made? made they were, but what did he make them of?" They
   must have, originally, been made out of what before was not, seeing it
   was his pleasure that they should be; for, for his pleasure all things
   are and were created. Rev. v. 9. And so, (as was said before,) if you
   take matter within the compass of being, it must itself be a made
   thing.

   Now, concerning this act, the bringing of all things out of nothing,
   take this twofold assertion, which we shall evince to you, and
   according whereunto we are to conceive of it--that it is possible to no
   created agent: and--that it is possible to God.

   First: To all created agents, it was impossible to bring something out
   of nothing. It is impossible to all the power of nature, unto the power
   of whatsoever creature, or unto all the creatures uniting their power.
   I shall not trouble you with the reasonings of the schools to this
   purpose, by which they plainly enough demonstrate creation (that is,
   bringing something out of nothing) to be impossible to any creature. It
   is, indeed, a much disputed thing among them, whether God cannot impart
   his power, whether it cannot be communicated to a creature, so as that
   he may not make use of a creature in creation; but it is little
   material how that goes.

   But that a creature cannot, by all its own strength, be able to bring
   any thing out of nothing, nor all created power put together, needs no
   other conviction, but an appeal even to common understanding. Nor can
   you conceive it any way possible for you. And if you say, "No, I cannot
   do it alone; but if I take in the advice, or superadded helps of such
   and such things, possibly we may together." Why, suppose all the power
   and force of all men in the world, and of all created agents besides,
   were to be united in one act, you cannot so much as conceive that they
   could produce so much as one single atom into being out of nothing. As
   it is equally impossible to all created power to annihilate, as to
   create, to reduce something back again into nothing, as to produce
   something out of nothing. So also is it equally possible for the
   divine, uncreated power to bring all things out of nothing. And, then,
   therefore,

   Secondly: We are to conceive concerning this act, as it is impossible
   to any created agent, so it is possible to God, and to the divine
   agency. For it is plain, it implies nothing of contradiction in the
   thing itself; that that which did not exist, should exist, as it is
   evident that many things do exist which did not exist. Therefore, there
   is no contradiction in that, what did not exist, should exist, as it is
   evident that many things do exist. And, therefore, to suppose it
   impossible to God to make that exist, which did not exist, is itself to
   assert a contradiction. For the notion of God doth carry infiniteness
   in it: you cannot form a notion of God, but it must include
   infiniteness. But to say that he is infinite, infinite in being, in his
   perfections, in his power too, and yet, that he cannot do that which
   implies no contradiction to be done, is to deny God to be God. It is to
   say, God is but a finite being, or of finite power; to say, that which
   you call God is not God, which is a contradiction, when you say that he
   cannot do that which implies no contradiction that it should be done:
   that is, that that which did not exist, should exist.

   But admit this, perhaps you will object, that it is possible to divine
   agency to make something out of nothing, that doth not, however, prove,
   that God hath now done so. There are many things possible to be done,
   which are not actually done. And it is no argument, from the
   affirmation of the power to assert the act.

   To this, I only say, It is not alleged to that purpose; we do not
   assert the possibility of creating something out of nothing, to prove
   that something hath been created out of nothing; but only by way of
   answer to them, that would thereby prove, that something was never
   created out of nothing, because it is an enunciatio affirmation, that
   which is impossible to be done is never actually done, though it doth
   not follow, that because the thing is possible to be done, therefore it
   is actually done. And, therefore, this is alleged only in answer to
   them, that do say it is simply impossible. But we prove it not to be
   impossible, for many things exist that did not always do so.

   But we otherwise prove, that it hath actually been so, that is, that he
   hath made something out of nothing; that is, that we have proved it
   from those plain texts, that cannot but be understood in that sense.
   And we shall now prove it, from the gross and manifold absurdities,
   that they are unavoidably cast upon, who disallow something to be made
   out of nothing. That is, such absurdities as these; first, they must
   suppose this world to have been eternally, of itself, as it is; or,
   secondly, they must affirm there hath been necessarily self-subsisting
   matter from eternity; or, thirdly, they must assert, that God hath made
   all things out of himself, that whatsoever is made, is part of himself.
   But these are all of them the most manifest and gross absurdities that
   can be thought.

   i. That this world should have been eternally as it is, without
   beginning. They that will pretend to say so, must first throw away all
   divine revelation about this matter, which manifestly asserts it never
   to have been eternal, but hath begun to be. But besides that, they do
   assert, here, repugnancies in the very nature of the thing, for they
   must assert the world to be as new now, as it was several thousands of
   years ago; that it was as old, the first year, as now it is; that is,
   the first year in our account. Besides what is wont to be alleged by
   them who are for that second horrid opinion, that matter was
   necessarily self-subsisting from eternity; they think themselves
   concerned to prove the world's being from eternity, as it is; and they
   do so from that consideration, that then it is most unconceivably
   strange, that we should have no records of things, (as one of those
   Epicureans speaks) elder or of-a more ancient date than the times of
   the Trojan war, and the like. But,

   ii. That which is more plausibly, and more usually, taken up in these
   latter times, (though it was an ancient by-gone absurdity too,) is,
   that there must be such a thing as eternal matter, out of which many
   things were brought into this frame, in which now they are; and some
   that will not pretend to atheism do think, that only that matter did
   pre-exist, and things could not have been produced into that order and
   state wherein they do now appear, but by a divine agency; that is, by a
   divine power and wisdom running through all things, and modelling them
   into that form in which we do find they do now appear, and are now
   cast; but nothing is more obvious to them that do consider, than the
   gross absurdity of that opinion, that there must be such a thing as
   eternal, self-subsisting matter, out of which God made the worlds. For,

   (i.) That would ascribe to the matter, the most fundamental attributes
   of the Divine Being; that is, self-subsisting or necessary existence.
   Nothing can be imagined more grossly ab surd, than, that the highest
   and most radical, and most fundamental attribute of the Deity should be
   ascribed to dull and senseless matter, that is, to exist of itself, and
   that it should be possible to him, if he would, to reduce it to
   nothing: and that this prerogative should belong to every particle of
   matter, and that all matter being reduced into minute particles, even
   in our conception, then each minute particle must be in itself, an
   independent thing, existing of itself without dependance on any thing
   else. Which, if it be acknowledged, then shall you have as many deities
   as there are minute particles of matter through out the universe.

   (ii.) This will further confute that gross conceit, that there must be
   any self-subsisting matter from eternity. And if there were such, it
   were altogether impossible that this world should be made out of it.
   And so it is asserted, not only impiously, but vainly: impiously, as it
   doth intrench upon a peculiar and most fundamental attribute of the
   Divine Being, to wit, self-subsistence: and vainly, because it were
   impossible this world should be made of such matter, if there were any
   such; for whatsoever is necessarily self-subsisting is unchangeable;
   that which is necessarily what it is, can never be other than it is.
   And it is altogether impossible that a world could he made of it,
   without its undergoing various changes. If it be necessarily such, of,
   and from, itself which now it is; that which is necessarily what it is,
   is eternally what it is. And therefore, can never be liable to any
   change, not so much as that intrinsic change of motion. For suppose any
   minute particle of matter to be of itself necessarily, it must be
   somewhere; and if it be necessarily any where, it can by no succeeding
   change be any where else: and so must be simply unmoveable. And then,
   this world could never be made of it, that is, of unmoving matter: and
   it must be unmoving matter, and uncapable of motion, if it be of itself
   what it is. For if it be of itself, it must be necessarily somewhere;
   and if it be somewhere necessarily, it must be somewhere eternally, and
   can never change its place. And again,

   (iii.) That opinion of eternal, necessary, self-subsisting matter, the
   absurdity of it is enough to be evinced from hence, that is, that the
   ground upon which it is asserted, equally serves for the asserting of a
   manifest falsehood; that is, that nothing else is made out of nothing.
   We may as well suppose matter to be made out of nothing, as any thing
   else to be made out of nothing; but something else must be acknowledged
   to be made out of nothing. We told you, at first, speaking of the
   object of creation, that the universal distinction that created things
   are capable of, is into two heads, of mind and matter. Now, they must
   acknowledge minds to be made of nothing, that they are not eternally
   self-subsisting. And if a mind can be made out of nothing, why may not
   matter as well as mind? and it is plain, that (speaking of the mind of
   a creature) that must be made out of nothing: for it could never be
   made out of matter, matter being uncapable of thought; and thought is
   the most essential thing we can conceive of in the notion of a mind.
   This can never, upon any terms, agree to matter; that is a material
   thing: as such it is impossible that that should be capable of thought,
   or of the power of thinking.

   There is no part of matter to which that can agree, for you can
   conceive nothing of matter, or of the several particles of matter, but
   either its size, that is, being bigger or lesser, or its figure, that
   is, being so shaped; or its situation, that is, being in this place or
   that, in reference to other parts or particles of matter: or its motion
   to one part or another. Now, none of these can make the power of
   thought to be any way at all compatible to matter: for it must be
   grossly absurd to imagine, that if matter be of such a size, such a
   bigness, now it is true, being of such a size, it cannot think; but if
   it were a little bigger, or a little less, it could think. And then,
   again, if you speak of the figure of it, if it be round, it cannot
   think; but if it were square, or triangular, it would; how absurd is
   such a conception or imagination as this! So likewise, to think that
   motion should endow it with a power of thought is most absurd: that,
   being here, it could not think, but carry it there, and then it can
   think. Or to think that situation could give it that capacity. And you
   cannot think or conceive any thing of matter but one of these. Now if
   any of these cannot contribute to make it have a power of thought, to
   make a mind of it, I say, since there were minds that were not of
   themselves from all eternity, and could not be made out of matter, then
   those minds were made out of nothing. And if minds were made out of
   nothing, why not matter as well as minds? And that is a third
   consideration to evince the absurdity of that imagination of
   self-subsisting matter, from eternity, out of which the world must be
   supposed to be made. And,

   (iv.) It will be further proved from hence, not only to be ab surd, but
   blasphemous; that is, that it would make God to be a finite being. That
   was intimated another way before, but it will also appear this way that
   is now offered to your consideration. That is the only reason that is
   pretended, why there must be self-subsisting matter, because God cannot
   make something out of nothing; and so that he had not power in himself
   of creating matter: and then he cannot be understood to have in himself
   infinite power, or to be himself, virtually, the all-comprehending
   Being. But most certain it is, that the name God, doth comprehend all;
   as even the significancy of that title Pan, given to the god among the
   pagans did import, that he was virtually all things; that is, that
   there is virtually, nothing which is not comprehended in the most
   perfect excellency of his being. And therefore, if matter be something,
   if it be a real something, then it must be comprehended within the
   virtual power of the divine power: otherwise, that is not
   all-comprehending, and that it should not be so, is repugnant to the
   very notion of God, a Being of infinite perfection in himself. If he be
   such, then he comprehends this perfection in himself, the power of
   making matter, as it is a greater perfection, sure, to be able to do
   this, than to be, as to this, impotent. And then,

   iii. A third absurdity which is conjunct with no less blasphemy too,
   which they are cast upon who deny the creation, at first, to have been
   out of nothing; and that is the conceit of many of the stoics of old,
   and which hath been taken up by some more lately is, that God made
   things out of himself. Not meaning, nor referring as the efficient, as
   the agent, (as we all do) but to himself as the subjectum ex quo, the
   subject out of which things were made. So that all the creation, and
   the greatest sorts of creatures, they are several parts of God, so and
   so diversified. But to this, nothing more needs to be said than,

   (i.) That the Divine Being is simple, impartable, uncapable of division
   into parts: it is inconsistent with the perfection of God, that it
   should be otherwise: and,

   (ii.) The Divine Being is the most perfectly spiritual Being, the most
   purely and perfectly spiritual; and therefore material things were
   never made out of it. For it is altogether as impossible to turn a
   spirit into matter, as it is to turn matter into spirit.

   Something I would say by way of Use, before I go off from this head,
   and proceed to the other, the manner, here, as ascertained how we come
   by this notion of the creation; that is, faith. Pray make this
   reflection, upon what hath been already said: If this creation could
   originally come out of nothing, then let no doubt, I beseech you,
   trouble your minds about a new creation. Did God, at first, make heaven
   and earth, or make the worlds out of nothing? Sure he can as easily
   make a new world out of that ill state of things in which we now be
   hold them, as he did the whole world, as now it is, out of nothing. If
   you will say, There are no appearances looking that way: if there shall
   be a new heaven, and a new earth, how can we admit that thought, when
   there are no appearances tending thereunto? Why, this world was first
   made out of things that did not appear. There were no appearances as to
   the creation of this world before it was made: what if there be no
   appearance, nay if there be contrary appearances, if things look quite
   another way, and with a quite contrary face and aspect? What is all
   that to Him who, at first, made heaven and earth with a word? It would
   greatly facilitate our faith, if we did this, if we did but consider
   these two things: first of all, the greatness, and secondly, the
   facility of this work of God. The greatness of it, so vast a thing and
   so great a thing as this world is; and the facility of his doing: he
   spake and it was done; as the Psalmist expresses it; Dictum factum, As
   soon as it could be spoken, Let such a thing be! and it was, "Let there
   be light, and there was light;" Let there be heaven and earth, and they
   were. So to make a new heaven, and a new earth, when the season thereof
   comes, is equally easy, as all things are equally easy to Him that can
   do all things.

LECTURE XII. [26]

   Before we proceed to the next head, it remains only to consider
   somewhat that is wont to be objected, by such as too much indulge a
   litigious temper and disposition of spirit, against the one and the
   other of these acts; the putting things into this order wherein we find
   them, and the bringing of things into being that were nothing before.

   1. There are that do object against that act, which is here expressed
   in our English, by the name of framing of worlds, the putting things in
   them into the order which we now behold. That is, It is objected, that
   if this order which we see in the universe, were the effect of divine
   wisdom and design, it would be certainly much more accurate than we
   find it; things would be done with more exactness, there would not be
   so many defects as we see in the universe. It seems not to be congruous
   (such do imagine) to the wisdom of God, that he should under take the
   settling of an order in this creation, and that it should, in such
   respects as have been mentioned, and many other, be liable to so much
   exception. And to this, there are several things to be said. As,

   (1.) That it is very true, indeed, the order of things would be more
   exact, and accurate than it is, if it had been God's design to make
   every creature, and the whole frame of things as perfect as he could
   have made it. But we have no reason to imagine that that was any thing
   of his design. He did not make it to answer our purpose, but his own,
   all being to run into an eternal stale of things at last, and this
   temporary state to be of short continuance. And therefore, let such as
   do think, there should have been greater exactness and accuracy in this
   frame of things, (if this will not satisfy them) sit down and wonder,
   that when it was intended, one time or another, such creatures as they,
   should be raised up into being in the world, that God did not put
   things into better order for their entertainment, that he did not make
   every thing more exactly to answer their fancies, appetites, and
   humours. But,

   (2.) It is enough to the purpose here asserted, that the worlds were
   framed by the Word of God, by the Eternal Logos, that did predetermine
   the order of things, and by a powerfully exerted word, in the time and
   season, when things were to exist ad come forth into being. I say, it
   sufficiently answers what is here asserted, if it doth appear that all
   things were done with design, and so as that they could not be done by
   any wisdom or power less than divine. This is enough for our purpose,
   that there are characters of design upon the whole frame of things: but
   that such a design as this could never have been laid, nor could ever
   have been effected by any created wisdom or power whatsoever, for the
   wisdom we see in the contexture of the things which we beheld, is no
   where, in the creature, accompanied with power capable of doing such
   things. Not to speak of things in particular, if you do but consider
   these two properties of things that are framed and made, either first,
   the magnitude of some, or the parvitude of others; (only to instance in
   those two,) as it is manifest there was a design, so it is equally
   manifest that no created agent could have done any thing like either of
   these. Either,

   [1.] As to magnitude: the magnitude of the universe, what created agent
   could have made so vast a fabric as heaven and earth, as "the worlds?"
   which is the expression in the text. All created agency must confess
   itself outdone. Nothing is left us upon that account to consider, when
   we ask the question, How came there to be such worlds? It is resolvable
   by nothing else, but that the worlds were framed by the word of God.
   And then,

   [2.] On the other hand, if you do but consider the parvitude of things,
   the many multitudes of things that have life: no created agent can
   contrive or do any such thing. Multitudes of little creatures, in the
   kinds of them, too little to be seen by our naked eye, but that by
   instruments may be seen to have their respective motive powers. And
   those that are capable of dissection, that there should be as many
   parts observable, for the several functions of life, in some of the
   minutest insects as are to be found in an elephant. It is plain, that a
   wise design there was in the framing of things as they are made, and
   that it is altogether impossible it should be done by any other but a
   Divine Agent: whether you consider the magnitude or the parvitude of
   things that are made. And again,

   (3.) There is this further to be considered as to this objection, that
   in looking upon, and taking notice of, the works of God, we are not to
   consider them abstractly and severally, but we are to consider them as
   parts of one entire whole, and in their reference to that. As a heathen
   philosopher, among the Greeks, tells us, "If we should make a judgment
   of the whole work of creation by this or that less comely part of it,
   it were the same thing as if one would give an account what sort of
   creature man is, and take for instance and example, such a one as
   Thersites, or one of the most deformed of all men, and so give an
   account of the structure of the human body by such a one, that there
   would he as little cause of cavil, as he would have with a picture
   drawer, who should find great fault with him that he put not bright
   colours every where, that there are, any where, dark shadows to be
   found." This, and much more to this purpose, is discoursed by a
   heathen, for the vindication of God as to this thing, that there should
   be any thing of defect, or not the most absolute perfection to be found
   in every creature that we can look upon. And again,

   (4.) It is further to be considered to this purpose, That we are to
   consider the time and texture of things in this universe, not barely as
   now it is, but as at first it was, and to consider what this inferior
   part of the creation, which was made for the use and service of man y
   was in its original state, when he was in his original state: that man
   for whom all this lower world appears to have been made, is become a
   degenerate creature, an apostate creature. And that, as he is gone very
   far from his original, things are very far gone from their original, in
   which they were made for him. The frame of this world is not like what
   it was. What changes there were in it for the sin of man, before the
   flood, we know not. But that must have inferred a universal change in
   all this earth. And we find, as to the point of longevity, things have
   altered apace and did gradually alter in that respect. So as in a short
   compass of time, in comparison, lives of seven or eight hundred years,
   or more, were come to sixty or eighty years, a very great, and hardly a
   tolerable age, all labour and sorrow. That sickness and mortality are
   come into this world, it is true: but who brought them in? They were
   sinners that introduced them. It is sin that hath so slurred the
   creation of God, as to that noble creature, and as to the subservient
   creature, proportion ally. And,

   (5.) It is further to be considered too, that God hath, since the first
   creation of things, settled an ordinary course of nature in the world,
   which ordinarily he doth not invert or alter, but for some very great
   purposes. As when, now and then, a miracle is to be wrought; otherwise,
   usually, he doth not interpose to change the course of nature, but lets
   things run on according to the tendency and current of second causes.

   (6.) In the last place, as to this objection, this is further to be
   considered, that this is more an argument, that the order we find in
   things should proceed from God, that there is not such an accuracy in
   every punctilio to be beheld, than if it were so: that is, it is more
   suitable to the divine greatness. There is this, among men, to be
   observed, that according as they are of greater minds and spirits, they
   do less concern themselves about light and trivial matters. And they
   reckon a kind of rational neglect to be greater, to have more in it of
   majesty, more that doth beseem a great man and a great mind. They are
   little minds that do minutely concern themselves about trifles and
   small matters.

   2. But again, there lies matter of objection, with some, against the
   other of these acts. The former, his putting things into order, the
   latter, his putting things into being. And with this, the objection
   that lies with divers, and hath done, in latter and former ages, is the
   authority of that maxim, Ex nihilo, nihil fit, that nothing can come
   out of nothing, and therefore, there can have been no such thing as a
   mere creation; which (as I told you) the act supposed, the act of
   framing of things: the order of things doth suppose the being of them.
   But this, say they, could never be, that that which was nothing should
   become something; for common reason doth allege, that out of nothing,
   nothing can be made, nothing will be nothing still, everlastingly.

   But to them, I have only two things to answer--that herein they do
   mistake the maxim that they rely upon, and--that they contradict
   themselves.

   ( 1.) That they mistake the maxim, upon the authority whereof they
   pretend to rely, that nothing can come out of nothing: for it can only
   imply these two things--that it is impossible for any thing to come out
   of nothing by itself, and--that it is impossible that any thing should
   come out of nothing by a created agent. In both these senses, the maxim
   is most certainly true.

   [1.] That it is impossible, that any thing should come out of nothing
   of itself: that is evident to every understanding that reflects and
   considers. If we should but, in our own supposition, imagine, that
   there were nothing now at all in being of one kind or another, it is
   certain that to all eternity there would never be any thing in being:
   as we have had occasion to argue to you heretofore. We find that
   somewhat now is, and therefore, we are sure that something hath always
   been: for if there were any time when there was nothing, to all
   eternity there would be nothing. Because it is impossible that
   something should ever itself arise out of nothing. In that sense, the
   maxim is most indubitable; that it is impossible that something should
   arise out of nothing. And,

   [2.] It is equally indubitable in this sense too, that a created
   agency, or all created agency put together, if it were all to be
   exerted into one act, could never raise something out of nothing. But
   to bring the authority of this maxim against the omnipotent agency of
   the supreme and sovereign Cause, is the most absurd collection that can
   be thought. As if we could measure the Divine Agency by that of the
   creatures. It might every whit as well be said, that because a child
   newly born, cannot build a house or a city, that therefore, it can
   never be done, no agency could ever do it: and the difference is
   infinitely greater between God's agency and any creature's, than
   between that of the meanest and weakest creature, and that of the
   mightiest that can be supposed. This is to circumscribe omnipotency,
   and to deny omnipotency to be omnipotent, which is a contradiction.
   What greater contradiction can there be, than to deny a thing of
   itself, to say there is any thing that is not what it is? But it is no
   contradiction, that that which was not, should be made to be, that that
   which did not exist, should exist, and so to bring something out of
   nothing; for that is within the compass of the object of almighty
   power, And then, I answer,

   (2.) As they that do so object, do most manifestly contradict the
   truth, so it is equally evident that they contradict themselves, in
   giving the account they do give of the original of things, such as it
   is. There are two sorts of them.

   [1.] There are some; first, that will have all substance to be one,
   (such as Spinosa and his followers) and so to be uncreated, and that
   there is nothing created but the modifications of things. But as to
   them, I inquire whether these modifications were in that substance
   before, yea o&no? If they were before, then they were not produced, and
   so nothing is produced. But if they ware not in that substance before,
   (which they imagine) and yet be something, (as they cannot pretend them
   to be nothing) then this something is throughout of nothing: and they
   cannot but be compelled to own so much. And we find it actually to be,
   for we find things are modified so and so. And then,

   [2.] There is a second sort, who do not make all substance to be
   self-existent and eternal, but only matter, as the passive subject,
   which the eternal, unmade Mind doth work upon.

   But even they also, must be constrained to contradict themselves. And
   it will appear most evident, that they do so, the matter being pursued:
   for a mind is not made of matter; there is no kind of cognation between
   a particle of matter and a thought, and so between the whole of matter
   and of mind. A mind can never be made of matter, or out of matter. But
   there are minds that are made; our own, theirs, if there were any that
   were not always; and then, they must be made out of nothing, for out of
   matter they cannot be made. And so, as to that objection, the objectors
   are manifestly found, both to contradict the truth, and to contradict
   themselves; and we need concern ourselves no further with them. [27]

LECTURE XIII. [28]

   Secondly. The second general head we now come to is, how or by what
   principle we are to understand all this. And for that, the text tells
   us, it is by "faith" that we are to understand it. How come we to know
   that this vast universe, these worlds, (which how many they are we
   cannot tell,) did all spring up into being by the word of God? How come
   we to be informed, or how are we informed of all this? Why it is by
   faith. Here, it is requisite to shew how this is to be taken, that we
   are by faith to understand the worlds to have been created by the word
   of God. Why,

   It is not to be taken exclusively, as if it were to be under stood no
   way, but by faith. It is plain, and hath been made plain, that it may
   be understood by reason too. And there is no prejudice at all in it,
   that the same conclusion should be capable of being proved by more
   arguments than one; and by more sorts of arguments than by one sort.
   Nothing is more ordinary, than to bring many arguments of one sort, of
   those we call artificial arguments, to prove the same conclusion: many
   such arguments may be useful to serve one and the same purpose: and it
   is no more inconvenient, and incongruous, that there should be
   arguments of more sorts than one, to prove the same thing, than that
   there should be many arguments used of one sort. Therefore, this is not
   to be understood exclusively, that we are to have the notice of the
   worlds being made by the word of God no way at all but by faith; or
   that we are to understand this by faith only: that the text doth not
   say, and we are not to take it so. But,

   We are to take it thus, that is, that we are to understand this by
   faith more advantageously; not exclusively, but with much more
   advantage than by any other way alone. My meaning is, that having
   plain, rational evidence of the creation, (as indeed we have such as is
   irrefragable, and as no mind which considers, can withstand) then, it
   is a great superadded advantage, to understand the same thing by divine
   Revelation too. It adds a great deal, to have the matter so stated,
   that I may also understand this by faith, that the worlds were made by
   the word of God.

   And, I shall now shew wherein this great superadded advantage lies; and
   wherein, if we compare the two ways of understanding this by reason,
   and of understanding it by faith, this latter way hath the advantage,
   even of the other. For, first, we understand more of it by faith, than
   we can by reason; and, secondly, what we understand by faith, we
   understand better.

   1. We understand more of it by faith, than by mere rational indagation
   or search, we could understand. We have a more circumstantial account
   of very important, considerable circumstances of this creation, as
   faith represents the matter to us, out of God's own Revelation, than by
   rational disquisition we could have had. We understand within what
   limits of time; and we understand in what order this work of creation
   was performed, by faith. Reason could never have informed us of either
   of these,

   (1.) We understand within what limits of time this work was done, that
   is, that all was absolved within the space of six days: no reason could
   ever have informed us of that. But it signifies much towards the
   liveliness of any representation, that the matter be represented in its
   circumstances. Reason, in the gross, could only have informed us
   generally, that all these things which do appear, are not of
   themselves, and were, some time or other, raised up out of nothing, by
   an almighty, creative power; but it could never have informed us within
   what limits of time such a mighty work as this was done. But our faith
   in the divine Revelation informs us of that too. And then,

   (2.) It informs us of the order in which things were produced, which no
   reason could ever have informed us of, or found out; that is, that on
   the first day, there being nothing at all but a disorderly chaos,
   (which must have been supposed first raised out of its primitive
   nothing) that God causeth a glorious light to spring out of that horrid
   darkness, that had every where spread itself over this chaos, this vast
   confused heap. He did but say the word, "Let there be light, and it was
   so."

   And then, it informs us, that on the second day, God ordereth a
   firmament, dividing the waters, or the fluid matter that was superior,
   made up of finer particles, from that which was inferior and more
   gross: the one, being designed for a nobler kind of use, and the other,
   for meaner services and purposes.

   And then, we are informed, again, that on the third day, God made, in
   this inferior world of ours, dry land and sea to appear, severally
   divided, and separate one from another, and distinct. And, that, as to
   the dry land, God doth implant in it the seminal principles of all
   sorts of vegetation, to make it capable of serving its after uses and
   purposes.

   And then, on the fourth day, all these glorious lights are made to
   appear, and shine forth in the firmament, that are ever since
   observable and conspicuous in the world.

   And then, on the fifth day, he replenished! this earth with all those
   sorts of sensible animals that we find it inhabited with, and by which
   they are so much the more to be fitted for the habitation and use of
   man.

   And then, on the sixth day, he makes man, and brings him forth into
   this orderly and so well prepared world; all things being fitted and
   accommodated to his use and purpose, as was most suitable and
   congruous; and gives him dominion over all; as the matter is so
   copiously, and with admiration of God, represented to us in that 8th
   psalm.

   And then, that having thus, in six days, absolved and finished all this
   great and glorious work, he now sanctifies, and hallows, and blesses,
   the seventh day. The Lord himself, (as it were) resting with
   complacency in the view of his own work, finding it to be good, and
   answering to the complete, eternal idea which lay in his own
   all-comprehending Mind. He beholds, with complacency, all that he had
   done, and so takes up that satisfying rest that was suitable to a God,
   in the contemplation of his own work. He did it with delight and
   pleasure; and now beholds it with delight and pleasure done. And so,
   takes man (the creature, here in this lower world, which he had made
   capable thereof) into communion and participation with him, in this
   blessed rest of his: upon which is founded the law of the sabbath.

   Now, all these things that could not otherwise have been known to us,
   but by divine Revelation, and our faith therein, God, telling us that
   things were so and so, and we believing him, and relying on the truth
   of his word therein, He did graciously provide that those things should
   be made manifest; that they should be made known to the children of
   men, in succeeding times, by casting all into sacred records. Though,
   that, indeed, were not done till a considerable time after this
   beginning of all things; yet, till it was done, the knowledge of these
   things was more easily transmitted or conveyed; three or four men,
   having seen all from the beginning of the world, and so were capable of
   telling one another, until the time when these things were capable of
   being transmitted into sacred records; these records themselves giving
   an account of those particulars that were transmitted, from hand to
   hand, by three or four of those that lived, successively, nearest to
   the beginning of time, who seeing and knowing, might tell one another.

   And we have these notices, all of us, from God, that thus these worlds
   began. And, indeed, if such a notification of these things, did but now
   first arrive to us; if there were but one such manuscript in being,
   that should give this account of the first rise and production of all
   things, and it were sufficiently attested and proved to be divine, of
   how great value and account would it be! Your great antiquaries, that
   have been so highly pleased in searching into the ancientest original
   of things, what would not one of them have given for such a monument of
   antiquity as this, informing us distinctly, from point to point, how
   all things came into being, and in that order wherein they now lie to
   our notice and view? The price thereof, would be above that of rubies,
   and all that could be desired, would not be compared therewith.

   That is one thing, whereby this understanding, by faith, the creation
   of the world, hath its advantage over any other way of coming to the
   knowledge or notice of it: that is, that we know more of it, by faith,
   than we could do any other way. And,

   2. What we do know, we know better. It is a better way of knowledge, or
   we may know better this way, to speak of the one and the other,
   comparatively, in several respects. As,

   (1.) It is an easier way of knowledge, than that of rational search and
   disquisition. There must, in order to that, to know things so, be
   usually a laborious inquiry into the reference of one thing to another.
   There must be an adaption of a frame and series of consequences and
   deductions; some whereof may be more obscure, but leads us gradually
   into clearer light, step by step. This is a more painful way of
   understanding things: it requires a very great exercise of mind to know
   many things by the deduction of a long series of consequences, one
   following upon another; and which the minds of men, generally, are less
   apt for, in this low and lapsed state of man. But how easy a thing is
   it, to have such a matter told us, by One who, we are sure, will not
   deceive us, and cannot deceive us? and then, to believe it, and take
   his word that so it is? This brings us to a satisfaction about this
   matter presently, and with the greatest facility, h is true, indeed,
   that as to this particular point of the creation, the matter is most
   plainly demonstrable, and very soon, to any capable and apprehensive
   mind: but if men were left to themselves, though they may be capable of
   discerning things represented to them in their dependencies, one upon
   another, they would not so easily find it out of themselves; and,
   therefore, as this is far the more easy way of knowing, so,

   (2.) It is a way, too, by which the thing may be more commonly known:
   so far as the divine Revelation doth obtain and extend, it may be more
   commonly known. Very true, as I told you, it may be demonstrable, most
   plainly, to an intelligent, apprehensive, unprejudiced person, that
   this world was raised up out of nothing, by divine power. But as there
   are few that have ever made it their business, so far to cultivate
   their minds, as to be capable of demonstrating this to themselves; so
   there are few, that have opportunity of consulting with those, who will
   take the pains, (having acquired so much knowledge themselves) as to
   make such a demonstration to them; so as that, with the most, it goes
   but as a matter of opinion. But few, if they were put to it, are able
   to prove that this world had its rise thus, at first. But now, if it be
   to "be believed, as a matter of divine Revelation, so far as that
   divine Revelation doth obtain, every one may presently be in formed;
   and so this knowledge would become as much more common, as it is much
   more easy:--every one can read, or hear this read, to wit, the account
   that Scripture gives concerning the original of things: and so this
   knowledge, by this means, shall not be confined to a few, as it would
   be confined to a few, if none could come to the knowledge but those
   whose minds are sufficiently cultivated, so as to be capable of
   demonstrating this to themselves, or of apprehending well the
   demonstration made of it by others. And again,

   (3.) It is a much clearer and more satisfying way, as well as it is
   more easy and more common. When the understanding of this matter is
   grounded this way, it is more satisfying to the mind; it makes things
   much more clear. They are but dark, and confused, and indistinct
   notices that we could have had in a rational way, of the beginning of
   things. But to be told this, from point to point, how all things were
   produced at first, and brought forth into that being, and order,
   wherein we behold them; what a satisfaction is it to an inquiring mind,
   to have such notices of these things!

   How much hath the matter been otherwise, with those that have been
   destitute of divine Revelation, in this matter, and who could not
   discern the state of this affair by faith. How conjectural have their
   apprehensions been; and how wild and exorbitant their conjectures, even
   concerning their own beginning. Man is nearest to himself: and if one
   would inquire concerning the beginning of things, one would inquire
   first of all, and chiefly, How did we begin? How came it first to be,
   that there should be such a creature as man here in this world? Those
   that have not had the help of divine Revelation, so as to be capable of
   understanding the matter by faith, as their apprehensions have been
   conjectural, so their conjectures have been the most strangely
   disorderly, inordinate, that could be thought; some imagining, that men
   were thrust out, at first, m little bags out of this earth, having been
   formed there: others have apprehended, that they were begotten in the
   bellies of fishes; (these were the conjectures of the great
   philosophers in the former ages of the world,) and by those fishes
   exposed and thrown out upon the earth. But to have an account given us,
   by the word of God, so plainly, how satisfying it is to the mind of an
   inquiring man! All dubious hallucinations about this matter, come now
   to be decisively and plainly represented, so as here is no more place
   left for dubious, and uncertain conjecture in the case. But this was
   the determination of heaven; and according to the determination of
   heaven, the thing was done. "Let us now make man:" and so God made man:
   "In his own image male and female created he them." Here is an
   expedite, clear, and satisfying account how we had our beginning. And
   then,

   (4.) This way of understanding, by faith, the beginning of things, the
   creation of all things, is much more impressive; which is the greatest,
   and most important thing of all the rest. It is more easy; it is more
   common; (where divine Revelation obtains,) it is more satisfying; and,
   lastly, more impressive; more apt to make deep, and suitable, and
   useful impressions upon our mind and heart. By faith, we understand,
   that is, to make the thing enter into our souls. That notice of such a
   thing, of so great importance to us, which is by faith, transforms the
   subject; moulds it into a suitable frame towards the Creator, towards
   itself, and towards its fellow-creatures, especially, those of the same
   order and kind. Here will be corresponding impressions made by faith:
   whereas, mere rational knowledge of the same things, makes very little,
   or that, that is, at best, but faint and languid.

   And the matter is very plain, that till faith comes, it is but an
   empty, notional knowledge, which people have of God's Creator-ship; and
   of their own creature-ship: of God, as their Creator, and of themselves
   as his creatures. It is but a slight, superficial knowledge that any
   have of these things, till faith comes: that carries a transforming
   power with it, so as to work the truth revealed, and believed, into the
   ver inwards of our souls. And it is more impressive, the knowledge and
   understanding even of this matter, which comes by faith, upon several
   accounts.

   [1.] Because the ground of this my faith, is distinctly and immediately
   divine. I believe such a thing, as God reveals it, because it is
   reported to me upon the authority of God, which carries a mighty awe
   with it, upon the soul, and so makes the thing revealed and believed,
   the more impressive. I attend to God in the matter, the authority of
   God. If I believe such a thing, with a divine faith, it strikes my
   soul, and carries the matter to my heart. And again,

   [2.] The notice that I have by faith, of these things, is very
   agreeable to an apprehensive mind; and so it enters in the more. Look
   to the matter really, as it is revealed, and the substance of the
   divine Revelation, concerning this matter, is congruous, and suitable
   to the mind and spirit of a man. There lie no unanswerable exceptions
   against it. The knowledge that comes by rational inquiry, and search,
   admits of objections: when the matter is to be wrought out by mere
   ratiocination, there will be reasons pro and con; arguments on the one
   hand, and arguments on the other hand: and many things that may seem
   reasonable to one, will not seem reasonable to another. But, as to what
   we are here required to believe about this matter, or what is matter of
   faith in this case, there is nothing in it but what is very congenerous
   to an apprehensive and unprejudiced mind, that is willing to know the
   truth of things. It may be, there is what should never have been found
   out, or known, if it had not been told: but to a considering mind, the
   thing appears to be just as it is told it is. I should not have thought
   of it before; but now I am told of it, it is very agreeable it should
   be so. And things do impress the more, accordingly as they are more
   suitable to them, they are the more easily received, there is less of
   obstruction lies against them. And,

   [3.] The notice we have of such things by faith, is the more
   impressive, for that this very faith itself is a divine principle,
   immediately divine, implanted, inwrought into the heart by the Divine
   Spirit. We find faith reckoned among the fruits of the Spirit. Gal. v.
   22. And we read of such a thing as the spirit of faith. 2 Cor. iv. 13.
   The Divine Spirit, when it comes to new-create, to raise the new
   creation, amongst all the necessary principles of the divine life that
   are now to be implanted in this new creature of God, there is faith,
   that great receptive principle, by which it is to take in all light and
   gracious influences from him. The very principle itself, is from God;
   and therefore, the discoveries that are made by it, must needs he so
   much the more deeply impressive upon the soul, because, that faith by
   which the impression is made, is immediately a divine thing. And, then,

   [4.] If you look to the act of faith, or its more immediate and
   connatural effect, it must he more impressive: faith, being described
   by its most appropriate act, or by its immediate effect, is called,
   "the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not
   seen:" expressions that represent faith to us as looking forward and
   backward, as what goes so immediately before the text in this same
   chapter. Hope, that always refers to somewhat future, is that by which
   we have the prospect of futurities; faith is the substance of those
   hoped fur things, those futurities; that is one expression of the work
   of faith, to substantiate future things that we do but hope for. And,
   then, there is another work of it, or its work is otherwise expressed:
   it is, "the evidence of things not seen:" and that is larger and more
   extensive, and represents faith to us as a principle that can look
   backward as well as forward. We do not see how this world was raised
   out of nothing: no matter for that, we can believe it; faith will be to
   us the evidence of that we never saw, or have not seen: faith will (as
   it were) place us upon the verge of this world: and let us see, as if
   we had stood by, when God did, in this orderly way, raise up this
   creation, part by part, out of a disorderly chaos, and heap of
   confusion, wherein all things lay. If we have that obediential
   subjection to the divine authority, revealing things, (which
   subjection, faith doth involve and carry in it,) this faith serves us
   instead of eyes; doth the same thing (being the evidence to us of
   things not seen, or of what we never saw) as if we had been by as
   spectators, when God was doing this great and mighty and noble work;
   one thing raising up after another into view before our eyes. Faith
   shews all this with evidence, and, therefore, is much the more
   impressive: so that, after the hearing of such a discourse as this, if
   it be entertained by faith, we should go away with hearts deeply
   impressed, having God in all the glorious excellencies of a Creator in
   view before our eyes; and our own spirits formed as dutiful, loyal,
   dependant, subject creatures, all full of adoration and praise; so as
   continually to behold him, and his fulness, filling all in all, which
   way soever we look or cast our eye: and that is the general use indeed
   which is to be made of all this.

LECTURE XIV. [29]

   And now, it is the particular Use of the whole which we are next to
   come to. And you see the heads of discourse, hitherto, have been two;
   and so we shall have two things to improve by way of use, that is,
   first, that we are to understand the worlds to have been made by the
   word of God: and, secondly, that we are to have this understanding by
   faith. Each of these do claim their distinct improvement. And,

   1. For the former. This is a matter to be understood, that these worlds
   were made, created; that this great universe which comprehends all the
   worlds, (we do not know how many the text means; but we noted to you,
   that it is not the dual number that is used here, but the plural,) is,
   most undoubtedly, a made thing. That the worlds were made, this we do
   understand. And we learn from thence,

   (1.) That the world was not eternal, that it had a beginning. This
   hath, on the by, been hinted before, and we have formerly proved this
   to you in itself; and, I think, sufficiently. We now consider it as an
   inference, that, because it hath been created, therefore, it was not
   eternal; therefore, it some time began. Indeed, this inference hath
   been doubted, and disputed by philosophers, whether it were good and
   strong, yea or no, that, because the world hath been created,
   therefore, it cannot have been eternal, but must have begun. Some have
   imagined, that it might be dependently eternal, notwithstanding its
   being a created thing. Some such as grant it to be a creature, have yet
   imagined also, that it might be, in a way of dependance, eternal. But
   in truth, the question would only need to be distinguished, and then it
   would be soon and easily answered: for that supposed dependance upon a
   cause, must be understood to be, either upon a necessary cause,
   necessarily acting and producing such an effect, or upon an arbitrary
   cause. If we should suppose this world to have been from God, as the
   necessary Producer of it, that would make this world itself to be a
   necessary being, and would be simply in consistent with its being a
   creature. All necessary being must be divine, must be God; whatsoever
   is necessarily, can be no other than God. But if it be meant of
   dependance on God as an arbitrary cause, considering an act of the
   divine will to intervene; that is, that it was his perfect choice
   whether the world should be, or not be, so it is impossible it can have
   been eternal, dependantly eternal, if the matter were determinate by
   divine pleasure. Shall this be, or not be? that supposeth it some time
   not to have been. It supposeth a transitus from not being to being; but
   that it is impossible it should be eternal; for there can be no change
   in eternity. That of which eternity is spoken, must have been always
   what it is, and as it is. Therefore, nothing can be more manifest, than
   that this world began: its being, depended upon the divine word, upon
   his pleasure: for that is the notion that the Scripture gives of the
   creation: "for thy pleasure all things are and were created." Rev. iv.
   11.

   And that should be a measure to us, how we are to conceive of this
   universe of things. Be it, or they, (the things contained in it) as
   great as we can imagine; let our thoughts be enlarged and raised as
   much as is tit, or they are capable of, upon such a subject,--the
   greatness and vastness of this universe: yet presently think, once this
   was all nothing, raised up out of nothing, sprang from nothing. It is a
   mighty disgrace upon created being, once to have been nothing. This is
   a disgrace upon created being, which it is fit it should bear; all
   shrinking into nothing before him who is the All. Magnify it to
   yourselves as much as you will or can, yet presently think it back into
   nothing: great it is indeed; but once it was nothing, mere nothing. It
   began to be, and therefore, there was a vast, immense duration wherein
   it was not, wherein there was no such thing.

   And, moreover, the worlds, in that frame wherein we behold them, cannot
   have been eternal: for it would be the most ab surd contradiction, and
   nonsense, imaginable, to say, that in this changeable state, wherein
   things are, they could be from eternity. It is a manifest contradiction
   to the understanding of any body, that would use his thoughts, that
   there should be eternal changes. And pray consider it. It may seem a
   little dark and obscure to you at first hearing, but stay a little upon
   it in your thoughts, and there is not any here of so mean capacity, but
   if they would use their thoughts a little, they may easily apprehend it
   impossible that there can be such a thing as an eternal change. Now
   there is in this world a continual succession, and a succession of
   changes. As to things that have life, to instance, there we see a
   continual succession of living and dying amongst all things that have
   life, and come under our view from day to day. But it is altogether
   impossible that there can have been such changes from eternity; for
   there can be no death; but there must have been life before: nothing
   can be said to die, that did not live. But to suppose any such change
   from eternity, an eternal change from life to death, it is a
   contradiction in itself; one must be first in its place; life must be
   first; and if life were eternal, it could never die; what lies under
   the measure of eternity must be always as it is. Eternum non patitur
   novum, there can be nothing new in eternity. And, again,

   (2.) As it is manifest, that this universe, these worlds, were not
   eternal, but began to be; so it is also manifest, that it did not begin
   to be by any kind of chance or fate. Some, who have admitted this world
   not to have been always what it is, in that order we behold it, yet
   thought, that it came, by a sort of casualty into this state we now see
   it. That matter having always been of itself, (as they absurdly
   imagine) they have thought that the eternal motion of this matter, the
   various rollings to and fro, of it, have at last produced this strange
   and orderly frame of things which we behold. But nothing is more plain,
   than as this world is a late thing, in comparison; for there was a
   vast, immense duration wherein it was not; and in comparison of which
   it is but lately come into being: so that, when it did come into being,
   it was brought forth, into that being, by a designing cause.

   The word, in the text, is emphatically enough expressive of that; it
   was brought into that exact and accurate order, wherein we see things
   lie, designedly, as the greek word here used, implies; as the several
   parts and limbs of a body are joined together, so as to consummate and
   make up one orderly frame. Order is the effect of design; wisdom is the
   parent of order. To behold that orderly frame of things which is
   observable to every eye in this universe of created beings, doth
   sufficiently shew, that it was not chance, but most profound wisdom,
   that hath brought things into this state wherein they are.

   That is most plain; that is, if the worlds were made, they are not
   eternal, but did begin; so that they did not begin without design. The
   wisdom of him that did design this orderly frame of things, ought to be
   discerned, acknowledged, and adored; and a continual disposition of
   heart to adore it, ought to be habitual to us, and often going forth
   into actual exercise. It hath been the constant frame of holy ones of
   old, and we should take heed of letting it be an alien thing to us.
   "Lift up thine eyes on high, and consider; Who hath made all these
   things," that we behold, in so much lustre, and beauty, and glory, over
   our heads? who hath made them, and produced all the hosts of heaven,
   and called them by name? "When I consider the heavens, the work of thy
   hands," (saith the psalmist) when I do, (it implies he did it often,
   that it was his wont,) then, I say, "What is man that thou art mindful
   of him?" Look to such places as I relate to, that Isaiah xl. 26 and
   psalm 8 throughout, and many more. It should be more our business to
   contemplate and admire the unsearchable wisdom of God, in the creation
   of this world. The great exercise and argument it is of a holy heart,
   that wherein it doth exercise itself, and by which it discovers itself
   to be such. Again,

   (3.) We may learn hence, the meanness and poverty of all
   creature-being, even upon the account of its being such; created and
   made. The worlds were made. As that doth argue them all, once, not to
   have been, so it argues them still to be next to nothing, continually
   depending. What was not of itself, ran not continue to be by itself:
   that which was drawn forth out of nothing, by an almighty power, still
   needs the Continual exercise of the same power, to keep it from a
   relapsing, and sliding back into nothing again; which otherwise it must
   soon do. Sin being come into the creation, there needed a mediator, for
   this purpose, that all might not be thrown back into nothing again: "By
   him all things consist." Col. i. 17. It is he that upholds and bears up
   the pillars of a tottering world; even where it was not obnoxious to
   justice, to a divine nemesis; yet, as being created, the mere
   liability, its dependableness, (which is proper to all created beings
   as such,) must have rendered it continually liable to relapse into
   nothing, if not continually upheld.

   You see hence, therefore, by the way, what an ungodly creature hath to
   trust in; what he hath, for the final object of his trust, to wit, that
   which is every moment ready to mutare, to drop into nothing, to go out
   of being, that is only sustained momentarily by him that made it. This
   is all that a wretched soul, that is off from God, hath to rely upon,
   to trust in; nothing but creature; nothing but that which itself is
   next to nothing: all such a one's dependance is upon that which doth
   itself, too, depend. He that hath not a God to trust, to rely upon,
   what doth he depend upon? Let him but name it to you; be it what it
   will, God it is not. Alas! mistaken man! thou dependest upon that which
   depends, itself: and how miserable a case art thou in? Indeed, the
   vanity of creature dependance, is obvious to every man's thoughts, that
   will but allow himself to think. But the wickedness of it, is but a
   little thought of: few think of that. Any man may apprehend how vain a
   thing it is to place confidence in a creature that is next to nothing:
   but it enters into the minds of but few to consider how wicked a thing
   it is. You must know, that to be the final Object, is the divine
   peculiarity of the Deity; and one of the highest, and most appropriate:
   a glory that he will not impart. As to be prayed to, to be invocated,
   that is hut secondary to this of his being trusted in: we trust first,
   and then invocate. This is a glory that he will not give to another. It
   is a homage due to Deity, which belongs to God alone, to be, I say, the
   final Object of trust; he, into whom my trust doth ultimately resolve.
   I know there may be a subordination; you may trust in a friend, in a
   relation: but for the final, supreme Object of trust, it is the
   highest, supreme worship of the Deity, to be placed only upon him.

   And therefore, it doth not only infer misery by disappointment, when a
   man trusts in a creature; but it infers a curse by revenge. It is not
   only an infelicity, that doth befal a man in such a case, when he doth
   expect that which is not to be had, from that which affords it not; but
   it is a wickedness, that is followed with a divine curse, with a just
   vindicta, for a wrong and injury done to him; that is, that I place
   upon a creature, that which is peculiar and belongs to him alone; and
   so, I do not only punish myself as a foolish, mistaken creature; but
   God punisheth me as a sinful, guilty creature, upon this account:
   "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm."
   Jer. xvii. 5. But, alas! how many do place their trust in ignobler
   creatures than man is, in things beneath man? So much the meaner and
   baser is the temper of their spirits herein, to place a reliance upon
   that which is meaner than themselves. To neglect and forsake, to avert
   and turn off from God: and then sink beneath themselves, creep to an
   inferior creature, this calls for the blast of heaven upon such a one
   that hath "forsaken God, the Fountain of living waters, to dig to
   himself broken cisterns, that can hold no water." For which the prophet
   (Jer. ii. 12, 13.) doth call heaven and earth to behold, with
   astonishment, as witnesses of such folly and wickedness as this;
   especially as being found in a people pretending to God. "My people,
   they that call themselves my people, have committed these two evils, to
   forsake me the Fountain of living waters, and dig unto themselves
   broken cisterns that can hold no water." When a man lets his heart
   unite, by trust, in that which hath nothing in it, forsaking the All
   for that which is of itself nothing; and which in itself cannot be a
   moment, what folly and wickedness is this!

   This is the snare that carnal, worldly-minded men run themselves into,
   and do not consider it as a deadly one; it is a snare of death: "Charge
   them that are rich in this world, that they trust not in uncertain
   riches, (the lubrious things, the uncertain things of riches, as the
   words admit to be read, (1 Tim. vi. 17.) but in the living God, who
   gives us all things richly to enjoy." That trust which is not reposed
   on the living God, it is not only the greatest folly, but the highest
   iniquity: folly lies in it, that they place Deity upon a nullity, a
   mere nullity. That which thou makest the final object of thy trust, is
   thy god; and, then, likewise, that trust is idolatry. God will be
   jealous in this case, when his rival is set up in his place; when a
   creature is made his rival; and the little minute things in this
   creation are made to fill up his room, and to be to thee instead of
   God.

   Naturally, every one affects to be happy, and when this is the natural
   tendency of a man's spirit, that it is now quiet, in some measure
   quiet, either in the possession of what he hath got, or in the probable
   hope of getting more; and of having within one's compass, that which
   one doth desire and covet, and reckon most suitable: here is my
   felicity, and I am so far quiet, because, I think here I have enough.
   As he is brought in, in the parable of the wicked fool, saying, "Soul
   take thy rest, thou hast goods laid up for many years." That which he
   had in his barns, that was his god; and now he thought his soul should
   rest, as thinking to have enough no where but there. Alas! thou fool,
   thy soul will be gone from thee this night, and then what will become
   of thee, and all these? What folly it is to set a man's heart upon such
   things: as the heart is set by trusting upon any thing. Trust fixeth
   it, as in its own place, as is spoken concerning trust in God; "His
   heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord." Trust, is that which fixeth a
   man's heart. But thou dost fix thy heart like a fool, who fix eth it
   upon any thing unfixed itself: for then what becomes of thee and thy
   trust, when that is gone? So do they who trust in uncertain riches; for
   "riches make themselves wings and fly away, as an eagle to heaven."--A
   strangely emphatical expression! It may be the soul would say to
   itself, "Shall my wealth, and my riches be gone? why, I intend they
   shall have no wings." Alas! they make themselves wings: they will not
   be beholden to you for wings; they will be gone of themselves, though
   you would never so fain they would stay. And there is an expression
   that is likewise strangely emphatical, and which is very proper to our
   present purpose, of setting the heart upon that which is not. All
   created being is so poor a dependant being, that it is next to nothing,
   and is rather fit to be called a mere nullity, a mere nothing: and that
   so despicable a thing should be put into the place of God! should
   supply the room of Deity: O! what an indignity is this to the Majesty
   of heaven; and how severely to be reproved! Be cause there is nothing
   else stable besides God; when the soul is once oft* from him, it offers
   to fix, but cannot be fixed; because its object is not fixed.
   Therefore, heathen light hath seen this, and a most significant
   expression was it of a heathen. "That a soul off from God, is like a
   cylinder upon a plain, that moves necessarily and perpetually, cannot
   be fixed, but continually rolls and moves this way and that; and cannot
   be otherwise, for it hath nothing to fix upon." And, again,

   This lets us see the absolute independency of the Divine Being; for
   what is there without himself for him to depend upon? These worlds are
   all that can be thought of extra Deum, without God; and they were all
   made by him. Can he depend upon that which he himself made? The worlds
   were created by the word of God; therefore, his being must be
   absolutely independent. And herein we should give our thoughts scope,
   it is pity we do not do it oftener, and more designedly, to consider
   the difference between that which is of itself, and which is not of
   itself. We might even lose ourselves and be swallowed up in the
   contemplation, to think of a Being, that, by its own peculiar
   excellency, could never not be, to which it was impossible not to be;
   which was not beholden to any thing; for all things were beholden to
   it.

   How is the great God magnified before our eyes, upon this account, in
   that 40 chap. of Isaiah, in several verses of it together, from the
   twelfth verse and onwards. "Who hath measured the waters in the hollow
   of his hands, and meted out the heavens with a span, and comprehended
   the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in
   scales, and the hills in a balance." Who is he that hath done all this?
   The "who is he?" there, is not an expression of doubt; but of
   admiration and wonder. O! what a One is he! How glorious a One that
   hath done so! "Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his
   counsellor, hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who
   instructed him, and taught him, in the path of judgment?" Who had he to
   commune with, besides what was himself, in going about this mighty work
   of creation? Who prompted him, who suggested it to him? "Come now make
   a world, give being to a creation." No! all was proprio motu. Who
   instructed this Spirit of God, as to this great affair of the creation,
   or any thing else that he doth? "Who doth all things after the counsel
   of his own will! Behold the nations are as the drop of a bucket, and
   are accounted as the small dust of the balance; behold he taketh up the
   isles as a very little thing, and Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,
   nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering. All nations
   before him are as nothing, and they are accounted to him less than
   nothing and vanity. To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness
   will ye compare unto him?"

   So should we, upon this account, greaten to ourselves the Divine Being,
   and heighten and raise our own thoughts and apprehensions concerning
   him: that when all things else, of this vast universe of beings, are so
   absolutely and purely dependant every moment upon him, he, in the mean
   time, depends upon nothing. All that he is, he is in, of, and by, and
   for, himself. He can have no dependance upon the creature, either for
   the support of his being, or for any other addition to his felicity:
   but is his own All. And how convictively doth the apostle reason with
   those philosophers at Athens, to this purpose, Acts xvii. 24. 25. "God
   dwelleth not in temples made with hands, nor is he worshipped with
   men's hands as though he needed any thing, inasmuch as he hath given to
   all, life and breath and all things." And what can you add to this?
   What support can he have from you? what improvement of his felicity any
   way from you, or from anything else, since all things are his own
   creatures? And further,

   (5.) You may learn, hence, the divine all-sufficiency; and how vast an
   amplitude of being there is in him, when all this great creation sprang
   from him; and yet, nothing could be detracted from him by it neither.
   How vast an amplitude of being must that be, when all this great
   creation is gone out from him, sprung from him, and yet his being not
   diminished, nothing the less! O! consider this, and think how great and
   desirable a thing it is, to have him for a portion; the All; he that
   comprehends in himself the all of the creature, and who formally
   possesseth his own All still: that is, is simply All. What can he want
   that hath him for his portion, who is All? All his own creation, it was
   virtually in him before, and is still virtually in him, depending still
   upon that power of his, for its sustentation, that gave it being at
   first. And there is his own infinite All too. O! happy that soul that
   can say, "The Lord is my portion." How rich, how full, how satisfying a
   portion! And,

   (6.) We may, further learn hence, the absoluteness of God's dominion
   over all his creatures. Will you not allow him to do whatsoever he will
   in heaven and earth, who made both by his own word? Shall he not do
   what he will with his own? We are apt, most unreasonably and peevishly,
   to regret it when there is a disposal of creatures; or any little
   minute part of this creation of God, this way or that, any otherwise
   than we would. But how absurd it is to repine at God's disposition of
   his own! He gives more of this world to such a one, and less of it to
   me. What then? What he gives to me, and what he gives to the other, was
   it not all made by himself? And may he not dispose, as he pleaseth,
   with what he had made?

   How doth he plead the matter with Job, to exalt his own dominion upon
   the ground of his creation? Job thought it hard that he who was so rich
   a man, so healthy a man, should be bereaved of all so suddenly, and of
   his health, and comforts of his life besides: "Why," says God to him,
   "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare if
   thou hast understanding. Did I consult thee when I made this and that,
   and the other creature? And may I not dispose of the creatures I have
   made, my own way, and as I will?" And,

   (7.) We may further learn, that if these worlds thus began, that is,
   were thus framed by the word of God; if they had such a beginning, even
   at his pleasure, then at his pleasure, too, we must reckon they will
   have an end. That which began to be at some time or other, it began to
   be what it is. Such and such things began to be at the pleasure of the
   great Creator: and at the pleasure of the great Creator they must cease
   to be what they are. And we ought not to think it strange, that there
   should be such an end determined for this world, as the Scripture
   informs us there is: that is, a time will come, at length, when, the
   purposes of the great Creator having been sufficiently served upon it,
   these visible heavens, which we behold, "shall be rolled up as a
   scroll; pass away with a great noise; and the elements melt with
   fervent heat; and the earth, and all things therein, be consumed and
   burnt up," as 2 Peter iii. 10. and we are not to think it strange. And
   it is only upon this ground, that it hath been thought strange, that
   this should be the end of this world, because the beginning of it was
   not understood, as we may see, looking in the same chapter, at the 3d
   and 4th verses: "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last
   days, scoffers, walking after their own lusts; and saying, Where is the
   promise of his coming?" "It is talked of that he will come, and then an
   end will be put to time, and all the successions of time. But all
   things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation to this
   day. And therefore, we cannot imagine that there should be any such
   end." But (saith the apostle) "this they willingly are ignorant of,
   that by the word of the Lord the heavens were of old;" and because they
   are willingly ignorant of this, therefore, they are wilfully ignorant
   of that end which is determined concerning this world. They will not
   believe it, because they believe not its framing at first: "that by the
   word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing in the
   water, and out of the water." Because they do not believe the beginning
   of things, therefore, they will not believe that which is told them
   expressly, too, concerning the end of them.

   There are a great many things more, that we might learn hence, but they
   will more immediately belong to the consideration of our own
   creatorship, than of the world: they do not so immediately result from
   the consideration of God's having made the world, as the consideration,
   more particularly, of his having made us; and therefore, I shall not
   insist on them till I come more particularly to speak to the creation,
   of man from another text.

LECTURE XV. [30]

   2. I shall, therefore, now proceed to make application of that second
   general head of discourse; that the more principal and advantageous way
   of our coming to understand the creation, is by faith. And it is a very
   manifold use that may be made of this. As,

   (1.) We may learn from it, the excellency of faith; how soul-enabling a
   thing it is. It hath a certain power, with very great light, to help a
   man's understanding, and to clear his intellectuals. By faith we
   understand. It hath, in great part, its seat in the understanding:
   there it is originally, though it is not finally there; thence it
   descends, too, into the heart. But it hath a great work in the minds of
   men. Faith doth supply minds with notions; so it is if we would read
   the words literally to you. It doth furnish us with notions, which we
   should otherwise never have. It is true, if it be faith indeed, it will
   not let them always remain mere notions; it will inspirit them; it will
   make them vital, and powerful, and operative. But notions they must be
   first, and faith makes them so. By faith we have notions of things,
   that otherwise we never should have had. But this, I say, speaks faith
   to be a soul-enabling thing. It nobilitates the mind and spirit of a
   man; acquaints it with things from God, (for that is the business of
   faith,) unto which it would otherwise be a stranger.

   This should raise and heighten our apprehensions of faith, that
   despised thing; that little understood thing. That by which we are to
   understand; men do not understand.

   Whatsoever it is that divine Revelation doth, in order to the informing
   us of needful and useful things, that faith doth. And take we the
   compass of divine Revelation, and consider all the great and glorious
   things that are contained and brought to light in it, and by it, and
   thence you are to collect the excellencies of faith. Because, without
   that, the divine Revelation signifies nothing to us; no more than light
   doth to a blind man. The divine Revelation and faith, must both concur
   to the same effect, to wit, our understanding of things; as light and
   the eye do both concur to the same effect, our seeing of a thing. We
   cannot see by light without an eye; nor will an eye enable us to see
   without light, but both together. The divine Revelation, that is light
   to us; faith is the thing by which we discern things in that light. And
   so, if we do apprehend an excellency in the divine Revelation, which
   brings so many great and important things into view before us, we are
   proportionally to apprehend the excellency of faith too; without which
   all that divine Revelation could signify nothing to us. And,

   (2.) We may further learn, hence, how wonderfully kind and gracious
   God's condescension is to us, that he should make such a discovery, and
   offer it to our faith, of things, in reference to which we should be at
   so great a loss, and understand so very little of: as for instance,
   this creation of God: what we do owe to the bounty of heaven for this,
   that it should condescend, so distinctly, to tell us how things came at
   first to begin. Faith, in that discovery which God makes to us of this
   matter, sup plies the room and place of sight; and so it is the same
   thing in effect, as if he had let us see him making the world; for
   faith is the evidence, to us, of things we have not seen. We were not
   present, we were not by, when this mighty glorious work was done.
   "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?" Where wast
   thou? saith God to Job: chap. 38. 4. But now, God having vouchsafed to
   us, such a Revelation and discovery of this mighty work of his; if he
   also gives us faith by which we believe this discovery, it is as if he
   had set us by him while all this was doing; so, we have (as it were)
   the idea, the representation, the landscape of the rising creation; as
   if God should before that time have created one of us, and have taken
   us, and set us up, spectators of his whole work.

   Whereas, yet, there was nothing but horrid darkness spread every where,
   then for God to have taken one of us, made us stand up out of nothing,
   and said to such a one--"Come, cast about thine eye, there is nothing
   but vacuity, emptiness and darkness every where; come see me make light
   out of this darkness." He that calls things where they were not, and
   makes them be, or as if they were, saying, "Light, where art thou? come
   out of that dark, profound abyss;" and immediately it springs forth,
   what an amazing light were that! Why, faith in God's discovery gives
   you this light: by faith we come to be so intelligible, to have so much
   understanding about us, as to know how this world did rise out of
   nothing, eternal nothing, into that state in which now it is. And what
   vouchsafement is this to such as we, to do, in effect, the same thing,
   as if he had set us by him at making of the world. "Come see me collect
   a mass of grosser matter; see me (as it were) spin out of it that fine
   texture of the vast and spacious firmament, those heavens that do
   encircle this little habitable world in which we dwell; see me adorn it
   with sun, moon and stars; see arising on this earth, plants, and trees,
   and woods, and springs, and rivers: all lately nothing, and now begin
   to be: see me replenishing this world with living creatures, in their
   several varieties and kinds." O! what condescension is this, that God
   should vouchsafe to tell us all this over again, and give us the
   representation so distinctly, of what, in so many successive days, he
   did and wrought in this kind. But, again,

   (3.) We may further learn, hence, how inexcusable it is, that they who
   pretend to faith in this matter, should use it so little. If we falsely
   pretend, it is a most unjust usurpation of a name, to call ourselves
   believers; and that, of such things, when we are not. But if we pretend
   truly and justly to the faith of these things, then we are most
   inexcusable to use that faith no more hereabouts; to live so long, in
   such a world as this, and so seldom to consider how it began. A strange
   and inexcusable stupidity. That this world should be replenished with
   intelligent creatures, reasonable creatures; and that it should come
   into the minds of so few, and into any minds so seldom to consider, How
   did all things begin? Sure we are there, where multitudes of things are
   existing, that must have had a beginning, that are riot self-existent,
   or unto which existence is not essential, so, as that they could not
   but be and exist. It is amazing to think that intelligent creatures
   should not more frequently consider with themselves, how things first
   began to be, beholding such a world as this, which they are sure was
   not always, but had a beginning; and not consider how it began. That
   men can behold such varieties of creatures, and use such varieties, and
   enjoy such varieties, and never consider whence they are, whence came
   they, how came there to be such things in the world, and how came there
   to be such a world? It is most inexcusable and strange stupidity, and
   dotishuess of mind, in any reasonable creature: but most of all in them
   that do pretend to believe and know by faith, that the worlds were
   created by the word of God. And,

   (4.) We may, again, learn hence, that what is commonly called faith,
   about this matter, is really and indeed not faith: that is, the
   apprehension of such a thing as this, is without effect, and that
   impresseth nothing upon the soul. It hath been very justly and fitly
   told you, that we have the notions of things by faith, many things
   which we should otherwise have no notion of. But though faith first
   begets such notions, yet it will not let them continue mere notions
   long, if it be faith: that is a mighty, lively, operative principle,
   powerfully working in the soul, to form that suitably to the thing
   believed. But while there is so little of suitable impression upon the
   souls of men, in reference to this thing, what they call faith about
   it, is not faith, but must be something else.

   For the most part, it is not any thing else but a negative faith, which
   men are wont to call faith in this and many other such cases. It is, I
   say, but a mere negative faith upon which they place that great name:
   that is, a not believing the contrary, not having formed explicit
   belief of the contrary, that they call faith. They have not yet (it may
   be) laid down in their minds any formed conclusions to this purpose,
   that the worlds were not made by the word of God; and their not
   disbelieving it, they call believing it: whereas, faith is a most
   positive thing, a thing of great reality, and a thing of great efficacy
   and power, wherever it is. And, therefore, for such as never yet found
   their souls impressed by their apprehensions of the world's creation, I
   would admonish them no more to call that apprehension of theirs by the
   name of faith, but call it something else,--call it by its true
   name,--call it a floating uncontradicted opinion; and that is the best
   they can make of it, while it is an apprehension that hath no power;
   and while it doth not represent God in his excellent glory, as the
   great Creator and Lord of all, so as to form the soul to adoration and
   subjection to him thereupon. Never say till then, that you do believe,
   or that you have faith concerning the creation of the worlds. Alas! how
   many that have it often in their mouths--"I believe in God the Father,
   Maker of heaven. and earth"--yet do but usurp the words, "I believe."
   and their heart, and their practice, contradict their tongue, and tell
   them they believe it not. Believe it! yea, as much as a known romance,
   while they live in affront of the Creator, and take upon them as if
   they were lords of the creation; and as if they had made the worlds;
   and not He.

   These things we may, by way of just inference, collect from hence; that
   it is a thing to be understood by faith, that the worlds were made by
   the word of God. But we shall thence proceed to some further Use; that
   is, to counsel and exhort those that have faith in this matter, to use
   it more; to have their faith more in exercise upon this great and noble
   subject, the creation of the worlds by the word of God. And it is to
   many great purposes, that faith upon this important subject may be
   employed and used. As,

   1. To engage us in the more frequent and serious meditations on the
   beginnings of things. To engage us, I say, in the more frequent, more
   serious, more affectionate, and more fruitful meditation of this
   matter. If we believe it indeed, let us think of it often. Our faith is
   an apprehension that it is true: and if it be once owned to be true, it
   cannot but be deemed to be a very important truth; a very considerable
   truth; a truth that requires, and challenges, great attention of mind,
   and application of heart and soul to it. Think and judge it an
   unreasonable thing, to live from day to day, in this world, and never
   consider whence it came, and how it began. And let your faith be set on
   work in frequent and most affectionate meditations of the beginning of
   the worlds,

   2. Let your faith, hereupon, form your souls into adoration of the
   great Creator. Go up and down this world with adoring souls: let every
   thing you behold, from time to time, put you in mind of him, and make
   you bow your head, and worship. Admire that fulness of his, that fills
   all in all; and those variable displays of his wisdom, and power, and
   goodness, which are conspicuous every where, more or less, in all sorts
   of creatures. We are but nominal believers and christians, if there be
   not many, if there be not much of this about us; and if we are not
   aiming and endeavouring that there may be more and more.

   3. Let our faith instruct us unto the grateful and reverential use of
   the creatures of God, as remembering they are made things; and that we
   have the use of them by divine vouchsafement and allowance. There ought
   to be a mixture, a temperature of reverence and gratitude in the
   habitual frames of our spirits hereupon: and if we have a real and true
   faith in us about this matter, it will make it to be so; it will
   impress our spirits; it will fill us (as it ought to do) with a
   wondering gratitude, that such creatures as we, should be so
   accommodated by such a world as this, so suitably ordered for us. If we
   use faith in this matter, it will make us sit down and wonder; look
   upon it as it is, an admirable thing, that the great God should have
   raised up such a creation, such a world, as this is, out of nothing, by
   the word of his power. That it being designed, "I, in time, coming to
   have a place and being in it, should want nothing while I am there;
   such and such creatures, made out of nothing to supply me, to furnish
   me. What is it that I eat? What is it that I drink? What is it that I
   wear? Are they not all the creatures of God? What is it that refreshes
   me? What is it that delights me? Are they not God's creatures?" How
   full of reverential gratitude should our hearts continually be, on this
   account! To think such and such parts of the creation were made on
   purpose that I might not be in distress, that I might not feel
   necessity; and to think bow this world gene rally accommodates its
   inhabitants: and to wonder with all, that their apostasy was foreseen!
   O! how should it replenish our souls with wondering gratitude, to think
   that there should be such a provision made with design, and upon
   foresight, for the entertainment of rebels and apostates! This whole
   world replenished and filled with the divine goodness, all sorts of
   creatures made for the unthankful and the evil. A design laid through
   so many successions of ages, "My goodness shall diffuse itself, and
   flow in such and such a part of my creation, (as this world is but a
   little, a very little part of it,) for the supply and support of those
   that will never give me thanks, (though they have natures capable of
   doing so,) even for the unthankful and for the evil."

   4. Our faith, upon this subject, should instruct and enable us to
   contend with difficulties in reference to whatsoever God hath
   encouraged us to expect, or told us he means to do. What can pose that
   faith which believes the creation of the world? He that could make such
   worlds as these are, out of nothing, by his word; what cannot he do?
   what is there to be expected greater than this, that should be the
   matter of any present solicitude, thoughtfulness, concern and care? If
   very perplexing thoughts of heart do arise about the ill state of
   things in this world, he that made heaven and earth, and all the worlds
   by his word, cannot he make new heavens and a new earth when he will,
   and when the time and season of it comes? How frequently may we observe
   it to be, in Scripture, for the people of God, to animate and raise
   their own hearts unto the belief and expectation of great things from
   God, upon this ground, that he hath made heaven and earth, that he is
   the Creator of all things. "Our God hath made the heavens." When those
   vain creatures that dislike the divine government, and oppose
   themselves to it, taking counsel against the Lord, and against his
   Anointed, when, I say, they have nothing to trust to, in the designs of
   this kind, they are forming and driving continually; nothing but stocks
   and stones, the work of men's hands; "Our God hath made the heavens;"
   (so you have it expressed, Psalm cxv. 3, 4.) made the worlds; given
   being to all these worlds: and what cannot he do } when his time and
   season for it are come? And things will come to their full issue in the
   fittest time. Our God it is, who hath power enough to do the things we
   expect, and wisdom enough to order the times and seasons for them.
   Again,

   5. Our faith ought to have exercise with us, upon this subject, in
   order to the keeping of our minds quiet and composed, amidst the
   various expressions and instances that we behold of the divine dominion
   and sovereignty, doing what he will in the disposal of affairs in this
   world. It may be, some we find him exalting, and it pleaseth us; we
   find him depressing, and it displeaseth us; we have a little share and
   portion in this world, and we regret it: others have a great and large
   portion of it, and that we envy. But we should consider whose this
   world is, who made it. May not he dispose of what he hath, made, as he
   pleaseth? This (as we noted to you before) is a just inference from the
   very thing itself, abstractly considered, that is, to form our spirits
   agreeably, and to make us content, and well pleased, that God does
   dispose of what he hath made, as seemeth good to him.

   6. We should further learn, hence, to behold, with great complacency,
   what appearances there are of divine glory in this world, which he hath
   made by his word. And to behold, with just regret, the dishonours that
   he meets with in it; or that these appearances of his are so little
   taken notice of; and that such glory shines unregarded as to the most.
   These are but dutiful dispositions and affections towards the Creator
   and Maker of these worlds: and faith should furnish our souls with such
   dutiful affections; otherwise it is a fruitless faith, a life less
   faith, if it doth not do this. Do I believe that God made these worlds,
   by his word? how can it then but please me to behold his glory shining
   in such and such aspects and appearances of God? and how can it but
   fill my soul with such dutiful wishes? "O! may thy glory, more and
   more, be exalted above the heavens, and shine through all the earth."
   And how can it but fill our souls with resentments, that there should
   be such glory shining, and not regarded? The great Maker and Lord of
   this world, excluded out of his own creation, as if the All in all did
   signify nothing! men taking upon them, every where, as if they were
   absolute, as if they had been self-created, and using the creatures of
   God at their own pleasure, and in affront to him that made them. If
   faith would do the part in our souls which belongs to it, it could not
   but fill them with regret, and with a dutiful concern, that the great
   Lord and Maker of this world, should be so little acknowledged, and
   taken notice of in it. Again,

   7. The faith of the creation of the worlds, should engage our hearts in
   an earnest desire and endeavour to have a sure and clear interest in
   Him who created and made all. What doth this world signify to me, to
   behold it, to be in it, to be of it, a part of it, but to have nothing
   to do with him that made it? The faith of this, would make a soul
   restless till it can say, "The Lord of heaven and earth is my Lord."
   Were these worlds created by the word of God? then he shall be my God.
   He that could make such worlds as these, by his word, is it not a
   covetable thing to have an interest in him? Is it not desirable? Can I
   satisfy myself till I have it? especially, when I find it is matter of
   hope, a thing not to be despaired of; when there are such notifications
   of his pleasure, (that he is inviting and teaching men to take him, and
   choose him) published and proclaimed in his gospel to the world,
   declaring now the terms by which he offers himself to be our God, and
   invites us to take and accept him for ours? The serious belief of this
   thing, that these worlds were made by the word of God, would certainly
   put us upon a most industrious inquiry, "How shall I do to know him,
   and to be acquainted with him, and to be interested in him, by whose
   word these worlds were made? And, I can not satisfy myself not to know
   him that made them, and not to have him for mine, since I find there is
   a possibility of the thing; that it is a thing not to be despaired of,
   and it is no unjust, or presumptuous aspiring, for me to seek an
   interest in him." My faith of the thing ought to make my soul restless
   in this case.

   And if one consider, cast one's eye round about, and behold this world
   in the extent of it, (as far as our dim and short sighted eyes can go,)
   and behold the great variety of creatures in it, methinks the thought
   should presently arise, "Amongst all these things, there is nothing
   suitable to me, to my spirit; nothing in which I can be satisfied, and
   in which I could take rest, unless I could find out him that made these
   worlds by the power of his own word:" till then, methinks one should
   always look very wisely about one, and behold the amplitude of this
   world; and then, presently to think, likewise, "Sure it is a sad,
   melancholy thing, to be in this world, as without God in the world,
   what an empty cipher is it, if God he out of my sight, if I cannot find
   out the Maker of all, so as to know him, and have him as mine." And
   then,

   8. If one can do so, how should our faith fill our souls with high
   gloriations in that God? I have him, that made the worlds, for my God.
   "All people will walk every one in the name of their God." And we
   should say, And we will walk In the name of our God: and see, where
   there is such another God to be found that hath made these worlds, (how
   many soever they be, and how great soever they be,) and all by his
   word: I have him for my God. And again,

   9. It should, by a little further recollection, make us apprehend too,
   the greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ, upon whom the business lay of
   redeeming and saving lost creatures in this world; and must lie of
   making a new world; of repairing a ruined and languishing creation. For
   you had to consider, that he had his part, he concurred, he was Creator
   even of this world. Look to the 1 chapter of the epistle to the
   Hebrews: He is styled "the brightness of the Father's glory, the
   express image of his person;" he that upholds all things by the word of
   his power--the heir of all things, and by whom he made the worlds. "By
   him he made all things, visible and invisible," Col. i. 16. and John i.
   1, 3. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
   the Word was God. By him were all things made: and without him was not
   any thing made that was made." And I will not undertake to exclude that
   from the signification and meaning of the text, "By faith we understand
   that the worlds were framed by the word of God," the essential Word,
   the divine Logos. Though, I would not lay a stress upon a thing that is
   not plainly and manifestly intended: yet, to take it in, is very
   suitable to the current of other texts of Scripture. The eternal Word
   had its hand and part in the creation; and it was by it, that these
   worlds were made. And thereupon, by a right of creation as natural, as
   well as by the acquired right of a Redeemer of a lost world, by the
   effusion of his blood, and the sacrifice of himself, he comes to have a
   governing power over all this world: being ascended and gone up far
   above all heavens, he hath all power given into his hands, both in
   heaven and in earth.

   I would only improve the consideration hereof, to this purpose, to
   greaten your thoughts concerning your Redeemer. We are fain in very
   important cases, from time to time, to be beholden to our senses, even
   in the most important cases that can be thought. Our sense tells us
   something of the greatness and amplitude of the world; though it cannot
   tell us much, yet it tells us something: and by that, make your
   estimate (for we need such helps) how great a Redeemer we have; him
   that made these worlds. They were made by the word of God: he was the
   eternal Word; and as such, we are sure, having the eternal idea in him,
   according to which the worlds were to be made; by him, at length, they
   came to stand forth into being. Think this with yourself, "This is my
   Redeemer; he that had so mighty a hand in the formation of all these
   worlds; and in whose hand the government of them now lies. It is with
   him I am to trust my soul. It is to him that I am to subject and devote
   my soul. Have I not reason to do so? Have I not encouragement enough to
   trust him, that made this soul, and all these worlds, and to obey him
   who hath so great and universal a power over these worlds?"

   10. Our faith in this matter should, more and more, release our spirits
   from mean and vile confinement to this one world only; for by faith we
   understand that there were more: therefore, our faith should release
   our spirits from a base confinement to one world, when it tells us of
   more. It tells us, there were worlds created by the word of God:
   therefore, it speaks an abject mind, a mean and base spirit, and so
   much the more if we have faith, (as we pretend to have,) to be confined
   in our thoughts, in our desires, in our designs, in our expectations
   and hopes, to this one world. Tell a believer, "Your all lies in this
   one world;" "No, (he will say,) my faith hath got ken of more, notice
   of more." By faith I understand that there were worlds, framed by the
   word of God; therefore, it is a base thing to be tied to the present:
   "Demas hath forsaken us, having loved this present world." A believing
   soul would look upon that with disdain, (there is such a generosity in
   faith) and would say, "I scorn so base a confinement as that, to be
   limited to one world, when I know there were worlds created by the word
   of God." Though we are not told how many there were, yet we are sure
   they are more than one; and we have a very distinct account of one
   more, in which our principal concerns do lie, and are signified to be.
   And blessed be God for that, that we know so much, that there is one
   more, with which we have more to do than we have with this world, or
   can have, even where our principal interest lies, and where our Lord
   and our Head is. O! how should we bless God for this! that since there
   are more worlds, he hath told us so, and hath let us know it. To be
   limited, in our spirits, to this one world, this present world, is to
   run counter to the design of our Lord's dying; "He gave himself for our
   sins, to deliver us from this present evil world." He gave himself for
   our sins: what doth that signify, in conjunction with the latter words?
   but that they are our sins that chain us in our present dungeon. And by
   how much the more we can be released from these chains of our sins, so
   much the more shall we get out of this confinement, and get above this
   present evil world. O! if we have many things that we dislike in this
   world, let us bless God that we know of more worlds. And in the last
   place,

   11. We may further learn, that our faith concerning the creation and
   being of this world, should very much facilitate our faith concerning
   the end of it. If we can believe, that these worlds were made by the
   word of God, we may easily believe what he hath told us concerning the
   unmaking of them. And particularly, the unmaking of this, the
   dissolution of it as to its present frame. We may argue from the one to
   the other, that since the one hath been, the other is not harder to be:
   if one be a thing to be believed, the other is as believable as that,
   when we are told it will be so.

   It is very true, indeed, that believing is not formally arguing; but as
   faith doth rest upon the strongest argument in all the world, so it may
   supply matter of further arguing, though it be not in itself formal
   arguing, it rests upon the strongest argument that ever was; that is,
   that because there is a Being in finitely perfect, therefore, he cannot
   but be true, therefore, it is impossible for him to lie; therefore, it
   is inconsistent with his nature to impose upon his creatures: heaven
   and earth cannot have a surer foundation than this which my faith hath
   upon this matter, and upon tins ground. And then, resting upon the
   strongest argument imaginable, it can easily supply matter of further
   argument; that is, if my faith hath once believed this, that these
   worlds were made by the word of God, because God hath told us so, if
   also, he hath told us he will put an end to the present world, and how
   he will put an end to it, as he hath told us how it began; if I can
   believe the one, I can believe the other, too, with the same faith: and
   so am to live in the suitable expectation of such a time, when these
   visible heavens "shall be rolled up as a scroll, and pass away with a
   great noise, and the elements melt with fervent heat, and the earth and
   all that is therein, be consumed and burnt up."

   And, if I believe this, then how entertaining must the belief be! How
   pleasant the belief of the other world (as was said before) that is to
   come afterwards, that pure, and peaceful, and orderly, and blissful
   world! that lasting, permanent, and everlasting world! that when this
   world and all the lusts thereof are past away and gone, shall abide for
   ever, and all they that do the will of God: as that expression is 1
   John ii. 17. "The world passeth away and all the lusts thereof." Love
   it not, nor the things of it. If you love it, the love of the Father is
   not in you: and it is passing away. God is not so unkind to you as to
   place your love upon vanishing things, upon shadows. This world, I tell
   you, and all the lusts thereof, are vanishing, passing away; will
   shortly be gone; the shew will be over: but he that doth the will of
   God abideth for ever in that blissful world, which it is his will and
   pleasure shall abide for ever.

III. God's Creation of Man
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE XVI. [31]

   Gen. i. 27.

   So God created man in his own image; in the image of God created he
   him.

   WE have discoursed to you, more generally, concerning the creation. We
   now come, (as we are more especially concerned,) to consider the
   creation of man. It is true, that there is a nobler order of creatures,
   that were before him in dignity and excellency (at least) in the
   creation. But because that, of their creation we have not so particular
   an account; and because our concernment lies less there, I shall
   immediately fall upon the consideration of what this text puts under
   our notice, to wit, our own creation, the creation of that creature,
   called man.

   The connexed particle here, that refers these words to what goes
   before. "So God created man," invites us to call back our eye a little.
   It is said in the 26 verse, "And God said, Let us make man in our own
   image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of
   the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
   all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
   earth." And then, the text tells us, "So God created man in his own
   image." This connexion shews us, that (as you have heard at large,) God
   worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. So he did
   particularly this great work according to forelaid counsels. "Let us do
   so; let us make man, and make him such a one, even like God." And so
   accordingly he did. This may be understood as an allusion to human
   methods; that is, that men, intending this or that work, they do use
   somewhat of self-excitation; in order thereunto, they do accingere se,
   they do apply themselves to the action which they intend, and, as it
   were, recollect their strength, that is now to be exerted and put
   forth. So is God introduced speaking--"Come now let us go to work
   afresh, and make that creature man, even the resemblance of ourselves."

   And it may also be understood to carry with it, an intimation of that
   great mysterious doctrine of the Trinity. "Let us make man;" that
   conjunction of the pronoun of the plural number, with a verb singular,
   (as we have formerly noted to you,) being probably enough to give some
   intimation of the glorious subsistences of the Deity: and who (as you
   have formerly had noted to you) are to be considered jointly under the
   notion of Creator.

   And it speaks the perfect spontaniety of this work, or (if that may
   import any thing higher) the perfect intellective liberty wherewith it
   was done. "Let us make man;" there being no foreign inducement before
   the creation, there could be nothing extra Deum, nothing without God
   himself, but proprio motu, from the inward propension of his own mind,
   and that vast and boundless abyss of goodness, the fulness whereof was
   in him, now flowing forth, by free choice and consent, into a creation;
   and into the creation of such a creature as this. "Let us now make man;
   it is our mere pleasure to do so:" according to that in Rev. iv. 11.
   "For his pleasure all things are and were created." He only pleased
   himself and took a delight in such an effusion of his own glorious
   power and goodness, breaking forth into such a creation.

   In the words themselves, we have two things distinctly to be
   considered,--the work itself, of God's making man--"God made man;"
   and--the norma or the pattern according to which he made him--"he made
   him after his own image," made him the designed representation of
   himself: we shall consider these severally.

   I. Consider the work itself, or the making of man--"God made man." And
   therein, we are yet more distinctly to consider--the product--man;
   and--the productive act--God made him.

   1. For the former of these, the creature now made, and signified by
   that name of "Man," that we are to consider and contemplate awhile;
   that is, that we are to turn our eyes inward, and contemplate
   ourselves, and consider what sort of creatures we are. We hear it
   often, that man is a microcosm, this whole world in little, an epitome
   of the universe; the two great classes of being meeting in him; viz.
   mind and matter, the in visible world, and the visible, touching one
   another, and having (as it were) a nexus with one another in his
   nature. He hath a mind belonging to the invisible world; and a matter
   belonging to the visible, in his composition and frame. And so is set a
   middle creature between the angels and brutes, having the intelligent
   nature with the one, and the sensitive and inferior nature with the
   other.

   We need to be put in mind of what is so obvious to us; for of all
   things in the world that we are so prone to overlook and forget, we are
   most of all apt to forget ourselves: though it were a precept of so
   high and great importance, and so obvious to a reasonable mind, that it
   did proceed from the mouth of a Pagan: Nosce teipsum, first know
   thyself, yet it was reckoned too great and important a thing, to be
   primarily attributed to such a one. And therefore, it was said of it, e
   caelo descendit; surely it came down from heaven: no mortal could
   assume to himself the honour to be the author of so great a saying as
   this. But though it be a matter of so great an importance, and the
   obligation thereunto, men perpetual lie, and do lie under; and though
   it be so obvious to a reasonable mind, yet, generally, look upon all
   the world, and you may say, "Men are the least part or study to
   themselves, they least of all consider themselves, to know their own
   natures, and what sort of creatures they are."

   But that we may a little more distinctly consider this subject, plain
   it is, that man is a twofold creature; he hath a double nature in him;
   he is a man and a man: or there belongs to his constitution and frame,
   an inner and an outward man: as the apostle elegantly enough
   distinguishes them, in 2 Cor. iv. 16. "An outward man," that is a
   perishable and perishing thing; and "an inward man." which, while that
   outward man is perishing, is yet capable of being "renewed day by day,"
   as he there speaks.

   Indeed, while we turn our eyes upon ourselves, we are least of all apt
   to consider what is most considerable in our own frame. A people
   related to God of old, and even the strictest sort, or sect of them,
   (the pharisees themselves) our Saviour justly upbraids them with this
   stupidity, this piece of inconsideration: he speaks to them as a
   company of besotted fools: "Ye fools, hath not he that made the
   outward, made the inward too," in that Luke xi. 40. "He that made that
   which is without, did not he make that which is within also?" But both
   of these parts of man, or each of this twofold man, we are distinctly
   and severally to consider, for both have that in them which claim and
   challenge the deepest intention of our thoughts. There is the outward
   man which the Scripture speaks of, bat under the notion of a
   tabernacle, the outward case or frame of man, (as I may so speak,) a
   thing whereof he is capable of being divested, and which may be laid
   aside. "I must shortly put off this tabernacle," saith the apostle 2
   Peter i. 14. He speaks of a going forth, an exodus, as out of his
   house, out of his dwelling--"the earthly house of this tabernacle," So
   it is called 2 Cor. v. 1. "For we know that if the earthly house of
   this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not
   made with hands, eternal in the heavens:" therefore, called a
   tabernacle, because it is designed but for a temporary and very short
   abode and residence that we are to have in it; in comparison whereof,
   the future residence of holy and good souls, is spoken of under the
   name of a "mansion," in John xiv. and in Luke xvi. "everlasting
   habitations;" these are but very temporary ones. But though they are
   so, yet their present frame and structure doth challenge a very
   serious, and reverend, and adoring contemplation; whether we look upon
   the grosser, or more bulky part of this structure or frame; or whether
   we consider that which is more latent, less obvious unto common notice.
   If we consider the grosser part of this structure, or tabernacle,
   either in the whole of it, or by parts, how admirable a thing is the
   composition of a man, even of the outward man, this exterior part of
   man! Such, as claims to have such things said of it, as we find, Job x.
   10, 11. "Hast thou not poured me out like milk, and curdled me like
   cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
   with bones and sinews. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy
   visitation hath preserved my spirit." All being prefaced with this,
   "Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me together round about, yet
   thou dost destroy me;" he then seeming, as if he were all of a sudden
   about to ruin, and throw back into dust again, his own excellent and so
   curious work: and of how great excellency is it, according to the
   account that these words give us, and according to that too which we
   have Psalm cxxxix. 13, 14. "Thou hast possessed my reins; and covered
   me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
   wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth
   right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in
   secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine
   eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect, when all lay yet in a
   rough creation; and in thy book were all my members written, (or in the
   idea of the Divine Mind) which in continuance were fashioned, when as
   yet there was none of them." They were all fixedly formed in the mind
   of God, while as yet there was nothing brought forth into actual being,
   so that, this was the effect of the wisdom of a God, this exterior
   frame of man, so contrived with so exquisite order, every thing
   belonging to it, in so apt subserviency to the several uses and
   purposes for which it was originally designed. Here is that which a
   pagan calls ars Dei, a divine art, the art of God himself, in this
   structure or frame, a fabric composed and made up all of miracles; if
   we consider the elegancy and curiosity of the whole, and if we consider
   how the several parts were equally made to serve, both for use and
   comeliness: so that of all the wonders in the world, I know no greater
   wonder than this, that man himself, a creature so capable of
   consideration and thought, should ever have thought it possible, any of
   them, that there should be such a production as this without design; as
   if it were a casual, an unintended thing, that there should be so many
   severals in this composition and frame of man, but never intended for
   the uses and purposes for which they so manifestly and peculiarly
   serve. How stupid a creature is man be come, that he is willing to
   admit even the greatest absurdity, rather than to admit God into his
   thoughts.

   If we look into this frame; (though I can but touch upon things, and it
   is hard to know where to touch upon so great a multitude of things both
   observable and admirable at once,) if we should consider the aptness of
   the several parts that are in common use for the several offices and
   functions which they perform; if we consider what is external; if we
   consider what is internal; if we consider what is ornamental in our
   frame; how full of the highest and clearest judications of the greatest
   wisdom that can be conceived! There are, belonging to this frame of
   ours, the organs of the several senses, which do give so many
   advantages to such a creature as man is: every sense, or sort of sense,
   it hath its censorium inlaid in this frame; the things that are
   necessary unto feeling, and necessary unto touch, and necessary unto
   smell, and necessary unto hearing, and necessary unto sight. All these
   organs do belong to the; outward man; though the sentient be somewhat
   diverse and distinct, from this outward and external frame for it is
   not the eye itself that sees, but the soul in the eye; nor the ear
   itself that hears, but the same soul in the ear; and so as to all the
   rest of the senses too; which we all know, if that soul were dislodged,
   and retired, and gone, could no more see, or hear, or touch or taste,
   than a stone: but the aptness of these several organs for their several
   uses and purposes, such a curious contrivance as that of the eye for
   the sight, and that of the ear for the hearing, it would require
   volumes to unfold and open these to you.

   And then, if we consider that which is more latent, even in the outward
   man itself, not obvious to the notice of any of our senses, and that is
   the more spirituous part, in this frame of man, or the several sorts of
   spirits. I do not now speak of his purposes, and without which it were
   impossible that any of these operations could be performed, which do
   belong to the nature of man in this present state. There are the
   elementary spirits that are to be found in it, and that are common to
   it, with the inanimate part of the world. As there is no sort of body
   conceivable, in which we may not also conceive some what or other of
   that which they call elementary spirit. And then, there is a higher
   sort of spirit, which serves for vegetation; and a higher than that,
   which serves for sensation; and all these, no doubt, some way or other
   distinguished, though we are not capable of assigning their
   differences, otherwise than from their effects; but all meeting in the
   frame of a living man: one sort of these spirits finer than another;
   another, again, finer than that; but undistinguishable by us by any
   other way, than only by such indications as the things effected do
   speak and hold forth to us. All these things we use continually; and we
   could do nothing without them; nor be what we are without them, in this
   present state. But seldom or rarely doth it occur to any thought, what
   they are, or that there are such things belonging to us, when without
   them there could be no motion: they are not things that are
   self-moving, (as no matter can,) yet they are things by which that
   which hath the power of motion in itself, doth perform such and such
   kinds of motions as are necessary in this frame of ours.

   If we should consider the several things which are thus used: as all
   the muscles in the body of a man, reckoned to be about four hundred and
   thirty, without which, and without the spirits that do move them, the
   man were a mere trunk, a dead trunk; so many several sorts of muscles
   to turn that one member of ours, the eye, this way and that way, and
   the several agitations of spirits that must be the continual spring of
   all these motions. How quickly do we turn our eye this way, that way,
   upward, downward, and never consider what turns it about us, without
   which no such motion could be performed.

   If we think of all this, what cause have we to break out often into
   those same raptures, that we find the Psalmist, herein, in that
   last-mentioned place: "How fearfully and wonderfully am I made: Thy
   works are marvellous, and that my soul knoweth right well." And it is a
   mighty emphasis that these words carry in them: "and that my soul
   knoweth right well:" that is, it signifies this to have been with him a
   wonted study, that his mind used to be fixed on the contemplation of
   it?"my soul knows it right well:" these are with me beaten tracks, they
   are not uncouth or unusual thoughts; these are things that I think of,
   over and over again, from day to day." Indeed, when any one comes to
   consider the works of God, and particularly, this work of composing
   this fabric of our outward man, they are wondrous; and we must consider
   them so. If we do but glance but one single thought upon this work of
   God, we cannot but say, "they are wondrous," But how few of us can say,
   "and this my soul knoweth right well:" that it is a thing to which my
   thoughts are used, and which is my continual work; I do, from day to
   day, employ them and keep them in exercise upon such a thing and
   subject as this.

   But time, and my own design of speaking as succinctly as is possible
   unto the several heads which I am to discourse of, al low me not
   further to insist on this same outward man.

   We are to look yet further: and when we have taken some view of the
   habitation, to consider the inhabitant, that thing in man called mind
   and spirit; spirit in a higher and nobler sense than we used that
   application before. According to the exterior part of man, that you
   have heard of, he is called Adam, a composition of earth, of red earth,
   as that word signifies, or out of the dust of the ground; that earth
   pulverized, reduced to the finest particles, according as more or less,
   so they were capable of being wrought into that curious contexture
   which their great Maker did design: hereupon man is said to be thus
   made. He hath the denomination there, first from his outward, more
   visible and observable part; this is the creature which appeared first
   to come under notice and view, upon this stage of this lower world.
   There was nothing perceivable of him, but this exterior frame that was
   called man: he hath that denomination Quoad apparentiam, in respect to
   what he did appear, and was obvious to common notice, or that might be
   in such creatures obvious to the notice of one another, the first
   notice. It could only, in that respect, be said, that God made man of
   the clay or dust of the ground; that is, what of man was capable of
   being made out of matter, was made out of such, or out of that matter.

   But you have afterwards, a further account of this creature, in the 2nd
   chap. of Genesis and at the 7th verse; that "God did breathe into him
   the breath of life, and he became a living soul." The outward man
   carried the name of man before; but now we are given to understand
   there was a nobler thing be longing to this frame and composition of
   man, which admits that he should be called "a living soul, "from that
   breath of life, which it is said God breathed into him, that breath of
   life. It is as significant an expression as we could have in words, or
   that words could furnish us with, of vital spirit, a living spirit,
   that is the principal thing in man. And so, now, he hath the
   denomination, Quoad rem as he had it Quoad apparentiam before. Before,
   he was denominated according to his appearance: so man was said to be
   made of the dust of the ground: now he hath his denomination according
   to what he is in reality; a living soul being breathed into him, as
   vital breath, from God himself, most immediately.

   And here we are to stay our thoughts a little, and consider what this
   is. It is to be known, (as all essences are,) but by certain properties
   that do speak themselves in such and such peculiar effects, and so tell
   us what the cause must be from whence such effects do proceed. It is
   plain, that this same soul of man must be a substantial being;
   otherwise, it were never capable of such actions and effects as we
   manifestly find do belong to us, and are wrought by us. Now if we do
   consider them severally,

   1. That which is fundamental of all other, is, that it manifestly
   appears to be a vital thing; the spirit of man is distinguished by
   vitality, by being essentially vital. It is very true, indeed, that
   these bodies of ours, as long as the soul inhabits them, live too, have
   life in them: but I pray consider, what is so very obvious, the
   difference of that life, from what we must understand and conceive to
   be the life of our spirits. We know the body of man so lives, as that
   it doth not constantly live, it doth not always live; and so life doth
   not belong to it essentially; life is separable from it. The body of
   man, it can be killed; it is capable of losing its life, and so its
   life is but a derived and a borrowed thing from somewhat else. Spirit
   hath life radically in itself. For we must conceive the spirit of a
   man, this breath of life (as the learned languages, Hebrew, greek, and
   latin, Have no word for spirit but that which signifies breath,) I say
   this spirit, or breath of life, is, in itself, vital, so as that unto
   it, to be, and to live, is all one. The body may be, and not live; (as
   I told you) life is separable from it; but the spirit, the soul, while
   it is, it always lives, its being and its life are not capable of being
   parted from one another, as it is in the life of the body. And so it is
   from that life, that the life which is in the outward man is derived,
   and transmitted in all the several parts of that body that do partake
   of life. And then,

   2. Next to life, (which is fundamental and indeed of larger extent, and
   not so distinguishing,) there is intellect; there is a power of
   understanding that belongs to the spirit of a man, by which his spirit
   is a thing capable of thought, or doth consist in a thinking power, a
   continual source or spring of thoughts; so that if we never so
   continually attend ourselves, we cannot find ourselves not thinking:
   there is a perpetual forge of thoughts, from whence they fly and spring
   up, as sparks from this or that fiery substance, and never cease to do
   so. And within that compass of intellect, lies not only power of
   forming thoughts, but of connecting thoughts; of affirming one thing
   that we think, of another thing that we think; and the power of
   deducing thoughts from other thoughts, of inferring some thoughts from
   former thoughts; that is, that because I think so and so, therefore, I
   consequently think so and so too; some thoughts having a dependance
   upon other foregoing thoughts: and a power of ranging thoughts, of
   methodizing thoughts, of putting thoughts into a frame and order,
   according to that relation which they mutually bear to one another.

   And this, shews this same thing called spirit or mind in man to be, not
   only a substance, but a substance quite of another kind from this
   outward man of ours, that is made up of matter, though there be things
   belonging to this frame, never so fine, and did require never so high
   purity of matter; yet plain it is, that the spirit, that is in man,
   must be somewhat of a quite different nature; inasmuch as there is
   nothing of matter, whether gross or never so fine, that is capable of a
   thinking power: for you can no more discern a tendency of a power of
   thinking in a flame of fire, than you do in a piece of clay; a flame of
   fire is nothing more rational, nothing more capable of understanding,
   than a log or a stone; and therefore, whatsoever hath the power of
   thought belonging to it, must be a being of quite another nature and
   kind, from any thing of matter, be it never so fine, never so pure;
   there being no property at all belonging to matter, that hath any
   possibility of contributing to such a thing as thought--neither figure,
   nor the size, nor the motion, nor the connexion of parts one to
   another. It is altogether an unimaginable thing, that a piece of
   matter, be it never so small, should be more capable of thought for
   being of such a figure, or less capable of thought for being of such a
   one: that if it be square it cannot think; if it be round, then, it
   cannot think: if it be of a less particle, then, it can think; if it be
   a greater, then it cannot think: if such and such particles be
   separated one from another, then they cannot think; if they be put
   together they can. No reasonable understanding can imagine any
   contribution in these things unto the act of thinking. And the motion
   of so many parts can contribute as little and no more than so. A heap
   of sand lying still, can be capable of no thought; and if it be
   agitated, never so much, it will be as little capable: therefore,
   nothing is plainer than, that this property of the mind or spirit of
   man; that is, intellect or the power of thought, or thinking, doth
   speak this spirit, or mind of man, to be quite a diverse thing from all
   the matter that belongs to the outward man; even from every thing of
   the out ward man; that the inward and the outward man must be quite
   diverse or different things. And then,

   3. There is the power of will or choice, belonging to this inward man,
   the mind and spirit within us, by which we are capable of determining
   concerning our own actions; of choosing or refusing, of resolving to do
   so and so; of resolving not to do so; or resolving to do the contrary:
   a strange power, and of vast extent, that doth distinguish and belong
   to the spirit of man, and through which this soul and spirit of man
   come to have that double capacity, to wit, of duty and felicity. I were
   capable of neither of these, if it were not for that elective power,
   and consequently upon the intellective, by which I am capable of
   choosing my own actions, and the objects upon which they are to be
   employed. I speak now of the original capacity belonging to the spirit
   and mind of man, not considering, at present, the impairment or
   diminution thereof, by the apostasy: of which there may be occasion to
   speak in the proper place, and season, when it may come in our way. But
   it is the same faculty or property of the mind or spirit of man, to
   wit, the power of election and choice, that makes him the subject both
   of duty and felicity. He were never capable of duty, if it were not for
   this; nor capable of felicity, otherwise than by this; as he is a
   creature obliged by the law of duty, and capable of being rewarded and
   remunerated by felicity. This is the thing inferred by the power and
   faculty in man, the power of volition, depending upon that
   understanding or cogitative power, which you have heard of before;
   though some take that term of cogitation to extend so far as to take
   this in too. But we are not considering of words now. And then,

   4. There is the executive power, by which we reduce into act, these
   purposes and intendments of ours; a strange sort of power; that is,
   being directly under the dominion and government of that former power,
   the power of choosing; that is, be cause we will do so and so; and so
   choose we to go to such a place; or we stay and move not: we move this
   and that member, or we restrain that motion. If we will, we can move
   our whole frame with very great facility; or else if we will not, it is
   very difficult to move it. That I can by the notice, by the command of
   my will, make my whole bodily frame so easily move to this or that
   place, which without that empire or commanding act of my will, it would
   give so much difficulty and trouble to others to do. And I move it
   myself nullo conatu, nullo negotio, upon the matter, I make nothing of
   it, I do it with ease. This is a power that we continually use; but we
   very seldom reflect upon it, that we have such an ability belonging to
   our natures, and even to the very nature of our spirits, the soul
   within, by which to move to and fro, these members of our body, as from
   time to time we do. And,

   5. There is belonging, as very peculiar, (and some think it is most of
   all peculiar,) to the mind and spirit of man, the capacity of religion,
   of which the brute creature is altogether uncapable: some think this
   more differencing of man than reason itself. It is a very dubitable and
   disputable matter, whether there be not that very thing in many
   creatures, that are reckoned brutes only, that we call reason. But
   concerning this, religion, the matter is out of all question and doubt,
   that it belongs, most peculiarly, to the mind and spirit of man; that
   is, the capacity of acknowledging a Divine Being, the Author of our
   being, and of reverencing and adoring that Being accordingly; that
   power by which I do suspicere numen, by which I consider a Being above
   me, the Author of my being, and of all beings, and of any disposition
   in me to pay a reverence and adoration to that sovereign and supreme
   Being there upon. And,

   6. Lastly, there is belonging to ibis spirit of man, (as peculiar and
   distinguishing too,) the power of governing the inferior faculties; the
   power of governing sensitive appetites and passions; and even, in very
   great part, the acts of the exterior senses: I say, in very great
   part--there will be some involuntary actions; but how far the natural
   power of man did herein originally extend, we are not in this state of
   our apostasy capable of knowing now. But undoubtedly, when man was
   himself in his innocent and instituted state, and where the inferior
   nature was held in direct subordination to the superior, as there were
   then no undue thoughts, so neither were there any undue; motions of an
   inferior nature itself, but what were certainly commandable and kept
   within due limits. And this empire did belong to the mind and spirit of
   man, to govern and conduct all the inferior appetitions and affections,
   and all the external actions, so as they should move or not move, be
   done or not be done, as to that governing wisdom seated on the throne,
   in the mind of man, did seem meet.

   Of this there will be more occasion to speak when we come to the latter
   particular in the text; to wit, "that in the image of God made he man:"
   when we come to treat of the norma and pattern of this great divine
   work. But upon what hath been said, thus far, concerning the product,
   the thing produced, man: surely our thoughts cannot but reproach us
   that they are so seldom employed upon so important a subject, and that
   lies so very near us: for what can be so near us as ourselves? That we
   can have our eyes round about us, like the eyes of the fool in the end
   of the earth, and so seldom find time and room for any such thing as
   self-contemplation.

LECTURE XVII. [32]

   Whereas, in the former discourse, we told you, that it is impossible
   that the spirit of a man, this inward man, can have been made of
   matter, so neither can it be made of spirit, for spirit is not a
   partible thing. If any should suppose it to be made of created spirit,
   it is as good to suppose it made immediately out of nothing, as any
   former created spirit; for the necessity will recur of referring this
   production, at length, to that special kind; to wit, of making a thing
   out of nothing. But for its being made of the uncreated spirit, God
   himself, that would 1)e to make the Divine Essence a divisible thing, a
   partible thing, as if there were parts capable of being severed from
   parts belonging to the same essence of God. And therefore, though among
   some of your heathens, (your stoics particularly) there have been those
   high hyperbolical expressions of men's being parts and members of the
   Godhead, Des partes sumus et membra, as Seneca's expression is; and
   that celebrated stoic speaks softly enough indeed of the soul's being
   divinae particula aurae, the soul should be a particle of divine
   breath; these are expressions allowable enough as high rhetorical
   strains, but not as expressions of rigid truth, by any means. If,
   therefore, the spirit of man were neither made of matter, nor of
   spirit, it must have been made out of nothing. And so in reference to
   this part of the product, the effect, the thing produced, man, that
   must needs be by most immediate creation in the strictest and most
   proper sense.

   As for the question, "Whether that these souls were made at once, or
   whether made successively just then, when put into a state of union
   with these bodies?" is a thing altogether unfit for us to concern
   ourselves about; it being, indeed, such a thing as divine Revelation
   hath given no determination to; and such a thing as no human
   investigation can ever be able to make a determination of, one way or
   other; we must be content to be ignorant where God hath drawn a veil
   over things, and not brought them into any kind of light that we can
   discern them by.

   And then, for the completing of this production or productive act, we
   are to consider, (as comprehended in it) the union that is brought
   about between these two parts, the outward man and the inward man,
   without which there could not be one product considerable in the case:
   for when we speak of God's making man, (as this text doth,) the meaning
   cannot be barely, that he made a body for him out of the earth, and
   that he made a soul for him out of nothing; the production of these two
   parts will not amount to the making of a man, unless these two parts be
   united and brought together, so that of both to compass and make one
   thing: a man is not created till then, not made till then. And most
   plain it is, that this union, it was made, at first, by God himself
   immediately, without the co-operation of any second cause. But it is in
   the after productions, brought about in a settled way and course of
   nature, in which, yet, we cannot say that man's being produced, doth
   consist in the making of his body, or the making of his soul; but in
   the union of the one with the other. There is not a man produced till
   then; till these two parts, being produced, are brought together, But
   they are not brought together in union in the same way as they were at
   first: for at first it was by God's own immediate operation; but he
   hath now settled the course of nature wherein all following productions
   are brought about. But yet, still it is his work; otherwise, man which
   was God's creature at first, would cease to be God's creature, if he
   were not still the Maker. Now concerning this union we have this to
   say:

   1. That it doth not confound the parts united, one with another; for
   the body is a body still, and not a spirit: and the spirit is a spirit
   still, and not a body. These parts do remain distinct in the union:
   there is no confusion of them in the case, nor identification; as if
   the nature of the one were lost and swallowed up, in the nature of the
   other. But the body continues to have all the properties of a body; and
   the spirit continues to have all the properties of a spirit; the
   properties of the one are not communicated to the other. It is not the
   body that thinks, nor the spirit that grows; or the like, but these
   particular distinguishing actions proceed, that are proper to the one
   and the other, they remain unto each. But,

   2. We have further to say, concerning this union, that, though under it
   the parts remain distinct, and are not confounded one with another, yet
   they are most intimately united; though it does not identify them, nor
   confound them, yet is this union a most close union, a most inward
   union, so as not to be ordinarily separable by any means that shall not
   discompose the recipient herein, that it shall be no longer naturally
   capable of being; so the soul cannot but stay there: and when it
   ceaseth to be capable of being the apt recipient of the soul, the soul
   can no longer stay; it is, therefore, a most intimate union; and a most
   marvellous one; and one of the greatest mysteries in all the creation
   of God; considering the vast difference that there is between these two
   natures, a piece of clay, and a mind; that these two should be so
   united together, that so long as the one remains naturally susceptible
   of the other, they can by no means be parted, they cannot be separated,
   while the crasis of the body remains entire. It is one of the greatest
   miracles in all the great creation of God; that is, that when this mind
   of mine, this spirit, is loose from all matter besides, I can move
   myself from this place, or that, as I will; I cannot yet, by any means,
   from this body of mine: to this piece of matter I am tied and fixed:
   and though this soul of mine be an elective and voluntary agent, and I
   do things electively, and at choice, I cannot at my own choice take
   myself out of this body of mine, to separate it from my soul; but
   whither ever I have a mind to go, it follows me, and goes with me, and
   cleaves with me; I cannot shake it off while the crasis lasts. This is
   a thing whereon the wisdom of the Creator hath infinitely outwitted us,
   and gone beyond us. We know not what hath tied this knot, this knot of
   man, made of these two parts, that are so little of kin, as dust and
   spirit are to one another, yet so to adhere to one another, as that
   they cannot be severed by any art, or any power, as long as the crasis,
   or whole constitution lasts, so as this mind or spirit can go out and
   come in at pleasure. Let it be considered, for it is one of the deepest
   mysteries of divine wisdom in all the creation of God. A great wonder
   it is in itself; and really, it is not a less wonder that it should be
   so little considered, that man, that hath such a thing as this
   belonging to his nature, a union of two such, so disagreeable parts,
   should so seldom reflect upon it, so seldom allow himself to
   contemplate and look into the mystery of his own composition.

   But now, to go on to the Use of this former part--God made man: here
   are but a few words. But it is a vast improvement that they are capable
   of, if we would give our thoughts scope; and if it might please the
   Divine Spirit to concur and fall in with his own word. Here lies before
   us the foundation, laid bare and open to view, of the whole law of
   nature: that which we call the law of nature herein, it hath its
   foundation even in this--God made man. It results but from the nature
   of God, and the nature of man compared together, or with one another;
   the nature of the Creator and the nature of the creature, this
   creature, such a creature. Inferior creatures are not govern able by a
   law; it is an intelligent, voluntary subject that alone is capable of
   being so governed. And inasmuch as God is the most perfect intellectual
   Being, and our Creator, and we are intellectual beings too, and his
   creatures, hence results upon us the obligation of that law which is
   called "the law of nature;" and may justly be so called, or which
   otherwise may be called "the law of our creation." Take that in the
   general. But to be here a little more particular, there are these
   several things to be learned even from hence--that God made man. As,

   1. Is God indeed our Maker? Then certainly there ought to be in us a
   most thirsty, longing desire to know him, as far as our minds are
   capable of knowing him. For what! Can I be content to be ignorant who
   it is that made me? Indeed, there cannot be a higher and more notorious
   violation of the law of our nature, or creation, to be willingly
   ignorant of that God that made me, and gave me being. But how dismal a
   thing is it, that we should so generally need to be taught how to
   answer the very first question that we are wont to ask our children:
   "Who made you?" I hope you are wont to do it; God knows how it is; but
   I hope it is your wont and use to ask your children, "Who made you?"
   But pray let us consider, Do we not need to be taught ourselves, what
   we pretend to teach our children, "who made us?" When you would teach
   your children so much, do you mean that they should repeat the words
   and no more? Is it not your meaning, that you would have them
   understand who made them? Is it not your meaning that they should have
   some notion in their minds of him that made them? If we had so, and a
   true, right, correspondent notion, O! how mightily impressive would
   that very thought he upon our souls; how would it strike through all
   our powers, for ourselves to answer that question, "Who made us?" He
   that is infinitely beyond all thought, beyond all conception, declare
   his name, or his Son's name, if thou canst tell: as it is said unto
   Ithiel and Ucal, Prov. xxx. 4. Into what an amazement should it put us
   to consider, what answer we should put to this question, "Who made us?"
   Into how profound thinking should it cast our minds? Into how deep
   thoughts? Out of how vast and immense a fulness and plenitude of life,
   and being, and power, we did spring? That vast plenitude, that abyss of
   being, that answers the question, "Who made me?" He made me, that is
   the infinite fulness of all being, and of all life, and of all
   excellency, and of all perfection: and shall not I covet to know him?
   At the same time that I acknowledge him incomprehensible, I must look
   upon the knowledge of him as most desirable, the most desirable of all
   knowledge.

   And therefore, it speaks a most horrid degeneracy (as there will be
   occasion more directly to take notice of hereafter) of this thinking
   part of man, his mind and spirit, that it can think of so many
   thousands of things, and covet to know them, affect to know them, but
   not affect to know the Author of its own being, of its own life, and of
   all those great powers and faculties that he hath furnished the
   reasonable, intelligent nature with; "They liked not to retain God in
   their knowledge." Rom. i. 28. They did not approve of it: that is the
   import of the word: a strange thing that this matter being proposed to
   God's own creature, and a creature capable of thought and
   understanding. Hast thou a mind to know God, to understand him that
   gave thee being? No, I do not approve of it. They approved not to
   retain God in their knowledge; there was a secret dislike and
   disaffection; "an alienation from the life of God." as it is expressed,
   Ephes. iv. 18. "and this they are willingly ignorant of," (saith the
   apostle Peter 2 epis. iii. 5.) "that the world was made at first by the
   word of God, the earth standing out of the waters and in the waters. Of
   this they were willingly ignorant." This matter, it lay hid from them,
   being very willing that it should: that is the import of the expression
   the Spirit of God makes use of there. It lies hid from them, being
   willing of it. What lies hid? That this world had a creation; of this
   they are willing to be ignorant; and so, consequently, that they had a
   creation. They desire not the knowledge of it; they say to God, "Depart
   from us, we desire not the knowledge of thee." Job xxi. 14. Here is
   divine light and glory shining every where through this world; but we
   choose rather to dwell in the dark as to this thing. "The light shineth
   in darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not;" receives it not,
   would exclude and shut out that light: a voluntary darkness; as if that
   darkness should entertain thoughts and communings with itself; as if
   there should be an agreement among the several clouds of that darkness;
   "Come, let us collect and gather together thick about such and such
   minds, to fence them against the beams of such light;" this mind is
   self-collecting, and gathering these clouds, drawing them in,
   inwrapping itself in them; "O! let us not know God, though he made us;
   God made me and yet I will not know him." O! unnatural thing; most
   monstrously unnatural.

   Even so it is with men in their distresses, when nature itself would
   dictate to them, "O cry to him to give thee help who hath given thee
   being." Do but observe that, Job xxxv. 10. "They cry by reason of
   oppression of the mighty; but none saith, Where is God my Maker." An
   amazing thing that men in their distress will many times cry to rocks
   and stones but not say, "Where is God my Maker?" Cry to rocks and
   mountains, (as they will at last) but lift up no cry to heaven, "Lord I
   would fain know thee, manifest thyself to me in this my distress." No,
   men will perish under their burdens rather than do it: such is the
   disaffected temper of men's minds towards God. Indeed, for ease and
   relief they will cry, but not for God, or say, "I want to know God;"
   that is none of their sense. "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living
   God, when shall I come and appear before God?" Nothing more remote from
   the minds and hearts of men than this sense. And yet, it is not
   understood, what they are incurring of guilt and misery, by this
   neglect of getting their minds furnished and enriched with the
   knowledge of him that made them. It is not considered what lies upon
   it. "It is eternal life to know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ
   whom thou hast sent." And if these two be necessary (as we find in that
   John xvii. 3.) If both these, I say, be necessary, how fearful a case
   is it, if we cannot get men over the first, or to the first, which is
   more natural. But the knowledge of the true God, that lies within the
   compass of the sphere of nature, that belongs to natural religion. And
   a compliance with the divine pleasure in this, to wit, seeking to know
   him, belongs to the law of nature, by the first and primary obligation
   of that law upon us. At what a distance are their souls then, from
   blessedness and eternal life, that when it is "eternal life to know the
   only true God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent," we cannot get man
   to the first. No, they are content to be all their days ignorant of
   God; yea, though he be a Father to them.

   O! strange prodigy of unnaturalness! So you would account it, if that
   were the temper of any child, that he did disaffect to converse with,
   or take any knowledge of, his own father. But this is the peculiar
   relation between God and men. He is a Father to them, a Father upon a
   natural account; as he hath been the immediate Creator of their
   spirits. And therefore, when Christ's line is run up to the highest,
   you find it run up to Adam--"Who was the Son of Adam:" and then by Adam
   it is run up to God--"Who was the Son of God," Luke iii. 38. and upon
   that account it is that we are said to be "his off spring," in that
   Acts xvii. 28. An expression that the apostle borrows from a celebrated
   poet of their own, a certain astronomical poet, who was highly in vogue
   with that people, or with the philosophers of that place; that
   university at that time. One of your own poets tells us "we are his
   offspring." Man is the creature of God: but with very great
   peculiarity. He hath many creatures besides. All the inferior universe
   are his creatures too: but among all, man only is the son; that is,
   there is none below him to whom that title is ever given of being his
   son. "And shall we not be subject to the Father of spirits and live?"

   Besides this supernatural ground of this relation of Father and Son
   between God and the spirits of men: I say, besides the supernatural
   ground of it in regeneration, it hath its natural ground. And you will
   see more of it when we come to consider the Second Part--Man's being
   created after God's image: for if we speak of human productions, a man
   makes many things himself, yet what things he makes they are of a
   different nature from himself; but whatsoever he begets is of the same
   nature, of a like nature with his own. Human nature can make many
   things, make houses, make garments, but they have nothing of a
   similitude or agreement of nature with the maker. But it is this
   peculiar sort of production that gives foundation to the relation of
   father and son, even that which makes the product to be of the same
   nature and kind, or of an agreeable nature to the productive cause. If
   man be the son of God, then he must be an intelligent being, as He is.
   And this is the state of things between God and men; and yet they do
   not know it, and choose not to know it, are willingly ignorant of it.
   The matter is upon account plain, that their ignorance of God is
   voluntary; for that it is evident, it is not necessary; that is, they
   do not live ignorant of God because he cannot be known: for his glory
   shines every where. There is not the meanest creature but proclaims
   Deity to every one who will attend: there is not the most despicable
   pile of grass, or grain of sand, or any such thing, that will not make
   an argument to us of Deity, that cannot fail but be most cogent and
   unanswerable. For take but one single pile of grass, one single grain
   of sand, and here is a real something; that is plain. But is it a thing
   that came into being of itself? Is this pile of grass, or grain of
   sand, a self-subsisting thing? No, by no means; no reasonable thought
   can imagine that, that it can be a self-subsisting thing: for then it
   would have more perfection in it than all the world hath besides, that
   did not make itself, or come into being of itself: then it owes itself
   to a maker, and so we are unavoidably led to God. If you but so much as
   set yourself to contemplate a grain of sand f or a pile of grass,
   follow the train of your own thoughts but a little way and you are led
   to God, whether you will or no: this is either something or nothing; I
   find it to be a real something: well, but what is it? a thing that
   subsisted of itself? No, by no means; for then it would have all the
   perfections, all the excellencies of the universe in it; and infinitely
   more; this grain of sand, and pile of grass, would have more excellency
   in it than all the world: for it is plain, that this world did not make
   itself; why then we must refer it to the Maker; and so you are led to
   God, whether you will or no, by so mean a thing.

   Therefore, I say, men's ignorance of God is not necessary; because they
   cannot know him: it must, therefore, be voluntary, because they are
   willingly ignorant of him. And the more plainly so, because, whereas
   they have a sufficient demonstration of the being of a God, even in the
   meanest creature, they have a more abundant demonstration in
   themselves, and from themselves. If a grain of sand, or pile of grass,
   will prove a creature and a Deity to me, how much more must I myself
   who know I did not make myself. I know I came into being so many years
   ago: so that this work of giving an answer to this question "Who made
   you?" doth not lie remote: I do not need to fly up into heaven, or go
   down into the depth of the earth, or to cross the seas, for an answer
   to it; but only look into myself. The word is nigh me, in my mind, and
   in my mouth; if I will allow that to speak my mind: I have in me these
   powers, these faculties, that nature, that most expressly represent God
   to me. I find myself a creature that can use thoughts; I find I have a
   power in me of laying designs, of forming projects, of foreseeing
   things, of comparing thought with thought, of inferring and deducing
   one thought from another. How manifestly doth all this lead me to God,
   the perfectly intellectual Being!

   Therefore, it is the most amazing thing, that our thoughts can reflect
   upon, that there should be such an indisposition and averseness in us
   to know him that made us. God made man; but man will not know God,
   though he be not a Creator, at large, only to him, but a Father; and
   man, in respect of his soul and spirit, his very offspring, he being
   the Father of spirits: upon the account whereof, pagans themselves have
   been wont to speak of God, as the paternal Mind, Father of all minds,
   and of all spirits, as some of them by the light that shone, even to
   them, could not avoid to see and say.

   There is but one thing that leads to many more parts of the law of
   nature, and our condition which results in all the several parts of it,
   from the collation and putting together these two things--God and man:
   man being considered as the thing made, and God as his Maker; God made
   man. Sure, I say, in the first place, nothing can be more reasonable,
   and suitable to this state of the case, than that man should have a
   mighty thirst to know God, to know him that made him. One would think
   it should be an uneasy state of the spirit of man, to be in any such
   ignorance of God as should proceed from neglect: to be ignorant of God
   by neglect, by not caring to know him, by not concerning one's self to
   have that knowledge, that should be the uneasiest thing in all the
   world to the spirit, to be capable to have that said to him, "So many
   years thou hast lived in the world, lived in the flesh, a tabernacle
   that thy Creator and Maker hath framed for thee, and put thee into it,
   and all this while thou hast not cared to know him, nor concerned
   thyself to get any acquaintance with him." It very much becomes and
   concerns us to covet to know him. It is a very unnatural thing to be
   content to be ignorant of him that made us; but not to be willing to
   know him, that is much worse. But now,

LECTURE XVIII. [33]

   2. We may hence collect, that our constant, grateful adoration of God,
   i a most reasonable duty incumbent upon all of us. Nothing is more
   deeply fundamental in the law of our creation, than the law of worship.
   "Let us come and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker." It is
   a joyful homage that is claimed unto him on this account, the most
   complacential adoration. "Let us come before him with thanksgiving: it
   is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves." Indeed, nothing can be
   more reasonable hereupon, than those two great parts of natural
   worship, to wit, supplication and thanksgiving. Supplication; Should
   not a people seek unto their God? Did he make us? did he give us being?
   from whom else are we to expect all the good we need? He that hath
   given us being; all the accessories of being are to be looked for only
   from him. And thanksgiving; these two parts of natural worship, are
   complicated in one another; in the institution of them, as they are in
   the reason of them, and root of them. "Let your requests and
   supplications be always made to him, with thanks giving," as in divers
   texts of Scripture, which I might refer you to, and even upon that
   account, that he hath given us our very being itself, which is the
   fundamental unto all other good that we are any way capable of, that he
   hath given us being of such a kind. So God made man.

   We should consider what is involved in the nature of man, and so
   bethink ourselves what we have to bless God for: that is, the primitive
   nature which God gave man at first, or where with he made him, every
   thing that he made was good, and so was that more excellently good. It
   is storied concerning Plato, a heathen, that dying, he gave God solemn
   thanks for three things: "That he made him a man, and not a brute; that
   he had made him a Grecian and not a barbarian, (there being much more
   light among them in his time, than with the rest of the world, to wit,
   the light of philosophy and cultivated reason;) and the third was,
   because he had ordered it so that he should live in Socrates' days, who
   was reckoned so great a luminary in that part of the world among them,
   while yet they were over spread with paganism." O! how awfully should
   we adore God that he hath given us a being; that he hath given us
   rational, intelligent natures, capable of knowing and enjoying so great
   things I that he hath assigned us our station in such a part of the
   world, and where we have opportunity to know a greater One than
   Socrates was! that he hath ordered our creation in such circumstances
   as he hath done, in such a time and such a part of the world! Nothing
   is a more equal law that can be upon us, than that we should have an
   habitual, adoring gratitude, possessing our souls upon such accounts.

   And, upon the whole, Adoration! how correspondent a thing is it to
   creation; adoration on our part, unto creation on his part? How
   convictive a saying was that celebrated one of Austen? "If I (saith he)
   were capable of making a reasonable creature to stand forth out of
   nothing, endowed with the power of reason and understanding, the first
   thing sure that I should expect from him would be, that he should fall
   down and worship me." In what an unnatural state, then, is this world
   upon this account, that being inhabited by so many reasonable
   creatures, it is inhabited by so few worshippers! Again,

   3. Another practical deduction from hence, is, that we ought to live in
   a continual dependance on him that made us. So God made man. Hath he
   made us, and will not we depend upon him? trust in him? This is most
   essential homage due to our Maker, to place upon him, and exercise
   toward him, a continual, vital trust. This is a glory which he will not
   impart, but concerning which he is jealous. And, indeed, as to purely
   internal worship, this is the first, and most radical of it, trust in
   God: and so very natural to an intelligent creature, that I remember
   Philo Indaeus hath this expression concerning it: "That he is not fit
   to be called a man, that hath not in him hope towards God." He seems to
   mean it of what is most natural to man, that he is not to be reckoned a
   man, that doth not trust in God, and doth not place a hope in him.

   Natural dependance is reckoned, consequentively, essential to a
   creature; and it is so. A creature is naturally a depending thing; an
   explicit dependance, that doth as properly belong to an intelligent
   creature, as natural dependance doth to all other creatures. A
   creature, as such, taken at large, is a mere dependant upon him that
   made it. This whole creation is nothing else but a thing dependant upon
   God, upon divine power and upon divine pleasure; according to which it
   was determinable, whether it should be, or not be; and according to
   which, it is continually determinable, whether it should continue to be
   another moment, yea or no. And so suitable as natural dependance is to
   a creature, as a creature, so suitable is intellectual dependance to a
   reasonable creature, as such: that is, that it should consider its
   dependant state, and often recount with itself, How came I to be what I
   am from moment to moment, when I can not promise myself a moment's
   breath or being? This is so appropriate a glory to the Deity, that when
   trust is supremely placed any where else, there is a curse pronounced
   upon it; "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man;" Jer. xvii. 5. for
   this is to rob God of his peculiarity; to place a homage on the
   creature, that is most appropriate and peculiar to the Creator.

   But it may be said, In our state of apostasy from God, what room or
   place is there left for trust in him?

   To that I answer, very certain it is. men are in an apostasy from God.
   But are they, therefore, always to continue so? especially when he is
   so intent upon a design for their recovery and reducement; and he
   insists still upon the right that he hath in his own creature. Because
   his creature is revolted and apostatized, and run away from him, hath
   he, therefore, lost his right in it? If there be an obligation upon an
   apostate creature to return, (and if it were a wicked thing to
   apostatize at first, it must needs be an increase of the wickedness, to
   continue in that slate of apostasy and not to return,) then, wherein
   stood our revolt, therein must stand our return. The revolt of a
   creature from God in his apostasy, lay in departing from him through
   "an evil heart of unbelief;" that it could not trust in him, did not
   trust in him; trusted the tempter and destroyer of souls, against him,
   and in opposition to him. And to come out of a state of apostasy must
   be by trust, if the going into the state of apostasy was by distrust.
   But this must he in God's own prescribed and appointed way and method.
   When once it hath pleased him to signify the way in which he is pleased
   to admit of sinners' return unto him, wherein he hath made the
   constitution of a Redeemer known, there must he a return in and through
   him, and trust in God through him: "Ye believe in God, believe also in
   me." John xiv. I. Where this way of returning to God, so as to make him
   the supreme Object of our trust, is not known, there the state of a
   sinner is less capable of remedy. But where it is known, it admits of
   so much the greater and deeper guilt, if yet there be no thoughts of
   returning, and returning in this very act, by placing again our supreme
   and vital trust upon him who was the first great and commanding Object
   of it; that did most rightfully command it, and challenge it, for
   himself; Shall I have a creature that shall not trust in me? not make
   me its all in all? Therefore, to have our interest in God restored by
   Jesus Christ, that must be our great business, who live under the
   gospel of Christ.

   And then, we are to trust in God under that very notion of the Author
   of our being, knowing, that because we are apostate creatures,
   therefore, that he will never, for our sakes, but he will, for Christ's
   sake, do the part of a kind, benign Creator to us. Our interest in him
   as Creator being now renewed; not. lost and swallowed up, but renewed
   and restored: and therefore, is the charge laid upon Christians (I
   Peter iv. 19.) to "commit themselves to him in well-doing, as unto a
   faithful Creator." His interest in us, as our Creator, was never lost;
   our interest in him, as such, was; but being now restored, upon this
   restitution, we are continually to trust in him, and commit ourselves
   unto him under the same notion of Creator, still. To commit ourselves
   unto him as a faithful Creator, that is, he did put himself, at first,
   under obligation (implicitly at least) to his reasonable creatures:
   "Obey and thou shalt live," shalt be happy, he freely putting himself
   under this obligation. But the creature, upon his revolt, forfeited all
   his interest in him, and all right to that promised felicity, which, as
   an obedient creature, he might have expected: by Christ this right is
   restored; and so God is to be considered now, by such as through Christ
   have returned to him, not merely according to the benignity of a
   Creator, but according to his fidelity also: "commit yourselves to him
   as a faithful Creator," he having resumed the obligation upon himself
   to treat such kindly: and he doth it, not merely from unobliged
   goodness, but obliged, which the notion of faithfulness doth imply. He
   will be to you a faithful Creator, if you commit yourselves to him
   accordingly as such. And again,

   4. Another piece of practice that we may induce, and should learn,
   hence, is a constant and most profound humility. What! am I a creature?
   So God made man: there had never been any such a thing as man if God
   had not freely made him. O! then how deep an impression of humility
   should this fix upon our souls! What am I? A creature depending upon
   will and pleasure; it was lately in the power of another, whether I
   should be, or not be. A proud creature is a monster in the creation of
   God; the most horrid monster in the creation. What have I to be proud
   of, who am of myself nothing, and should never have been any thing, but
   by vouchsafement, by the goodwill of another? It is to that only that I
   owe it, that I am any thing.

   If one creature have more, or do think he hath more, of real excellency
   than another, that, with the whole of his being is all but a made
   thing. Thy whole being, whatsoever excellencies belong to it, either as
   common to that sort of creatures to which thou art annumerated, or more
   special and peculiar to itself; if it be any thing, (if it be not
   merely a concealed thing,) it is a made thing, as thou art: thou wast
   made, and it was made, and it was made to be thine; but all depending
   upon will and pleasure, therefore is pride a most monstrous thing in
   the creation of God. The continual sense of all creatures, of any
   intellectual sense, should be this, "We are all nothing but what it
   pleased our Creator we should be. We have nothing but by his pleasure;
   our being is a borrowed being: and the additions, and all the ornaments
   that have occurred to it, are all made things, all borrowed things."
   Should any one be proud of that which he hath borrowed? To wear
   ornaments that every one knows were borrowed, and to be proud of them,
   what a madness is that? Our very being is a borrowed thing, and all
   that belongs to it.

   When God would humble a creature down into nothing, thereby to make it
   the capable receptacle of a Deity, a cohabiting Deity, that with such a
   one he might dwell, how doth he magnify himself the higher; "Heaven is
   my throne, and earth is my footstool." Isa. lxvi. 1. All these things
   have I made, they are all the works of my own hands. Now, if I can find
   a creature sensible of this, to such a one will I look, that is of a
   poor and contrite spirit, that humbles himself into the dust before so
   mighty and glorious a Creator; with such a one will I dwell; he shall
   be my temple the habitation of a Deity;" for the Deity will suffer no
   diminution in uniting with such a one; be cause that will still be
   looked upon as the All in all, while he still looks upon himself as
   nothing. And,

   5. We further learn, hence, the great equity of the law of self-denial;
   it is a most deeply natural law; and when it is made fundamental in
   Christianity, that is but the revival and re-inforcement of a natural
   law: "Except a man deny himself he cannot be Christ's disciple." Why
   so, why cannot he be Christ's disciple? Pray consider what was Christ's
   business, when he was to collect to himself disciples. His business, as
   a Redeemer, was to recover apostates back again to God ? and their
   discipleship to him, was only to put themselves under his conduct; that
   under the direction thereof, and through his mediation, they might
   return to God and be accepted. The very design for which a mediator was
   appointed, shews the necessity of his insisting upon this law as
   fundamental to the whole frame of Christianity. As if he had said, "My
   business as a Redeemer, as Mediator, is to recover and bring back
   apostate souls to their God again. Wherein were they apostates? In that
   they did set up themselves apart from God, and in opposition unto God.
   None can come to me and own me for their Head, and for their Lord, and
   Intercessor, and Mediator with God, but it must he under this notion;
   that is, that they look upon me as the only One by whom they are to be
   restored, and brought back into their primitive state, reduced to God,
   the great Author, and consequently the end of all things. And
   therefore, did Christ, in dying, "redeem us to God by his blood." Rev.
   v. 9.

   We are not to think, that we were, ourselves, the principal end of
   Christ's redemption; that would be an injurious and absurd imagination;
   to think that the creature was Christ's chief end, it were a horrid
   conception. God must be the chief end of all things; therefore, the
   design of Christ's dying was to redeem us to God; to restore back such
   and such creatures to God, that the end for which they were made, might
   be served upon them. Our interest in him is a secondary thing; but his
   interest and right in us was the primary thing. Therefore, it was
   impossible to be otherwise, but that Christ's designing the redemption
   and reduction of sinners to God back again, must lay this law as
   fundamental, at the bottom of all that religion he was to set up in the
   world; that is, self-denial. "You have lived in a separate state apart
   from God. If you are weary of that life, and will come off from
   yourselves, then you are for me; then you come under my conduct; I will
   make your peace; I will buy it out for you, (and he hath bought it
   out,) and procure your acceptance with God, upon your return." But this
   can never be, if you have a mind to live separate still, to stand upon
   your own bottom, and make self your first and last. No, God must be
   your first and last; and he really is the first and the last. And
   therefore, "unless any one be willing to deny himself, he cannot be my
   disciple." saith Christ; he cannot be a christian under any other
   notion than as one that is now willing that God in all his authority,
   and greatness, and excellency, and glory, shall entirely fill up that
   room which, before, self had usurped. And therefore,

   6. We further learn, hence, how reasonable and necessary a thing it is
   to man, as he is a creature, a created thing, to seek an interest in,
   and union with, God, as his highest and best good; for of himself he is
   nothing. That he is any thing (as hath been said) did depend upon
   divine pleasure. Such a one, if he do recollect and use thoughts, must
   needs state his case thus: "Not only am I uncapable of doing any thing
   towards my own felicity, but I cannot preserve myself in being one
   moment. What good have I then, but what I must expect from him that
   made me? I have been severed from God, cut off from God, the great
   Author of my life and being; I have not, in this my separate state, my
   good in my own hand; I have not enough in me to make me a happy
   creature; a creature I am; but I still need to be a happy creature. And
   when my very being is not my own, what shall I be able to command for
   my self, or procure for myself, or raise up to myself, within me, that
   shall be able to be a felicity or satisfaction to me?" He that Is
   nothing of himself, it is the most reasonable and necessary thing to
   such a one to seek a union with him who is All, I am in myself nothing;
   there ought, therefore, to be in me a propension towards him who is my
   All. My soul ought to incline towards him, to adhere to him, as its
   supreme and hest good; "Whom have I in heaven but thee? who can I
   desire on earth in comparison of thee?" And,

   7. A life of the most absolute devotedness to God, is the only
   righteous way of living; no man lives a righteous life that doth not
   live a devoted life. And what are we to deny ourselves for, as neither
   being able to procure a felicitating good to ourselves, nor as being
   allowed to design a supply for ourselves by any interest of our own?
   And why are we to deny ourselves in these respects, but that what we
   take off from ourselves, may be immediately placed upon God who is our
   All? As we are to seek a union with God for our real, present sup port,
   and for our final satisfaction, so are we to devote and addict
   ourselves to him in order to this service. When we adhere to him,
   (according to what was expressed in the foregoing head,) that refers to
   our support and satisfaction; when we devote ourselves to him, that
   refers to his service; that we may serve and glorify him: for that we
   are to devote ourselves to him.

   And that hath its reason in this too, that we are his creatures, he
   hath made us: and what did he make us for? Did he ever make a creature
   to be its own end? He hath made all things for himself: "Of him, and to
   him, and through him, are all things, that he alone might have the
   glory. Therefore, is our own created being, (as it is such) our very
   being itself, a perpetual, standing testimony against us as long as it
   lasts: if we live not devoted lives; if he who hath been the Author of
   our being, be not the end of it, this very being of mine is a testimony
   against me; for what sort of being is it? Not a self-sprung being, but
   a created being: So God made man. I am a made being; therefore, is my
   being a testimony against me, (the kind and nature of it being
   considered.) I am a continual testimony against myself, as I stand a
   created thing, depending upon will and pleasure, if I live not a
   devoted life, so as my own heart can bear me record, in the sight of
   God, that I do live to God. Being to ask myself the question, (and it
   is a shame to us if we do not often ask ourselves the question,) "What
   do I live for?" what is my business here in this world? If I cannot
   answer it with a sincere conscience, "Lord, thou that knowest all
   things, thou knowest that I principally design to live to thee, and
   that I reckon my life, and my being, a vain and a lost thing, otherwise
   than as it is sacred unto thee: I continually testify against myself; I
   should think it living in vain, to please myself, and to serve an
   interest of mine own, when I have not a moment to command, but depend
   upon the pleasure of another for every moment's sustentation in the
   being that I have." Who can answer it to himself, to live that
   sacrilegious and ungodly life? that is, not to live devoted to him by
   whom we live?

   8. We may again learn, hence, what reason there is why we should love
   God more than ourselves: you cannot but know, this is a thing most
   strictly charged upon us, and wherein we are upon no terms to be
   dispensed with; namely, that we are to love him above all. We owe
   unspeakably more to him than we can do to ourselves. We do not owe to
   ourselves that we are any thing. "He made us, and not we ourselves." If
   there be any thing of real goodness in the being that we have, there is
   infinitely more in the Author of that being: and if goodness, as such,
   be the object of love, the greatest goodness must be the object of the
   greatest love, and the highest goodness, of the highest love. And
   therefore, do not think that we are hardly imposed upon, when the law
   of our creation doth require and claim this from us, that we love God
   more than ourselves. And therefore, when our Lord Jesus Christ takes
   upon him the great business of our redemption, and reconciliation unto
   God, (which it was impossible for him ever to have effected, if he had
   not been God as well as man, upon the account of the Deity that was
   united in the same person with his humanity,) he claims so much for
   himself from us, that is, he doth tell us, that, if any man do love
   father, or mother, or wife, or child, or his own life, more than him,
   he cannot be his disciple. We are to consider that there is Deity in
   his person, the fulness of the Godhead; and so that he is, as such, the
   supreme Object of our love, to wit, the Deity which is in him, common
   to the Father and Spirit, must be the supreme Object of our love. It is
   as if he should have said, "I come, in kindness, to redeem and save you
   as lost creatures: you are not to think in doing so, I have laid aside
   my Deity; for then I could not have been a Redeemer and a Saviour to
   you: and therefore, having that Godhead united with my humanity, in my
   own person, I require this of you, that is, that you love me more than
   your very being: and you cannot be my disciples upon any other terms,"
   He was Creator, in conjunction with the Father, and the Spirit; for li
   by him were all things made, visible and invisible; and without him,
   nothing was made that was made." And therefore, we are not to think it
   a hard or an unreasonable imposition upon us, that we are to love God,
   and to love Christ, more than ourselves; more than this natural life or
   being of ours, so as that all must be a sacrifice to his pleasure, if
   he once say the word, or signify his will to that purpose.

   And that is the way, having lost ourselves, to find ourselves again, by
   loving him above ourselves. "If any man love his life," (that is,
   supremely,) "he shall lose it; but if he will lose his life for my
   sake, he shall find it." We find life, and all, in God through Christ,
   when we are lovers so as to make him the supreme Object of our love, as
   in that, John xii. 25. No man can really be a loser by so abandoning
   himself, as to place that love which he unjustly placed upon himself
   before, (that is, his supreme love,) now upon God, and upon Christ. No
   man can be a loser, but he finds himself again in this case. He had
   lost himself before; but now he is restored to himself and to his God
   both at once. Then,

   9. We may further learn, hence, how reasonable a thing it is, that man
   should be under government: Is he a creature? then he ought to be a
   governed thing. The most reasonable thing in all the world it is, that
   he that hath given us being, should give us law. Hath he been the
   Author of being to us? and shall he not rule his own creature? Shall
   that be allowed to have a will against his will? To have been raised up
   out of the dust, but the other day, out of nothing, and now to dispute
   whose will shall be superior, mine or his that made me, what an
   insolency is it! We may again learn,

   10. How foolish a thing is self-designing, when men lay their designs
   apart from God; forming their projects, as the apostle James speaks,
   chap. iv. 15, 16. "I will go to such a city, and buy and sell and get
   gain. And I will reside there for such a time." This all proceeds from
   our forgetting that we are creatures, made things. God hath made us; so
   that our breath is in his hands. How great an absurdity is it, as well
   as an injury, that I should talk of forming projects, and laying
   designs, when I am but a made thing, and there is an arbitrary hand
   underneath me, which sustains me; but that may let me drop and sink, in
   the next moment, if it be withdrawn. We ought to say, "If God will, we
   will do so and so." If your being depend upon his will, certainly your
   actions and affairs depend upon his will too. But for men to design so
   and so, without consulting God, or referring themselves to God, is to
   take upon them as if they were not creatures. And,

   11. We may hence learn, further, (as that which is fundamental to all
   the rest,) how indispensable an obligation there lies upon us to
   preserve a continual, awful remembrance of God upon our minds and
   hearts, from time to time, all the day long. "Remember thy Creator in
   the days of thy youth." I pray, let us but use our own understanding in
   considering this. When it is said, "Remember thy Creator in the days of
   thy youth." (Eccles. xii. 1.) Is the meaning of it, that we are only
   when we are young to remember him, and forget him all our days
   afterwards? No, the meaning is, that those days of our youth are not to
   be exempted, we are not at liberty to for get him even then, but that
   he claims an early and first interest in our time and thoughts, and in
   the truth and vigour of our spirits, and that we are to begin then,
   when we are young, as we are to continue all our days afterwards. And
   how is he to be remembered? Why under the very notion of Creator: that
   suggests to us the very reason why we are to remember him; because he
   is our Creator, and our breath is continually in his hands. What! do we
   think a man can subsist without God, any better when he is grown up, or
   when he is grown old, than he could when he was young? No, the reason
   upon which the obligation rests, is still the same upon us all our
   days; that, therefore, it is a most monstrous thing, to consider how
   men come to dispense with themselves in this fundamental duty, that
   virtually comprehends all the rest. All is lost and gone, if we do not
   so much as remember God. How can we dispense with ourselves to rise up
   in the morning, without a serious thought of God, and run after our
   common affairs all the day long, and still forget him? And lie down at
   night (it may be) without any serious remembrance of him? and yet lie
   down with the apprehension that we are innocent in all this; we have
   passed over this day well if we have succeeded in our business, if
   there hath been no disaster that hath befallen us, all hath been well;
   though there hath been no serious thought of God; no minding of God at
   all; that is to live in a downright rebellion against God, through a
   whole day; and also from day to day, through a whole life's time
   hitherto: for it must be entire and universal rebellion, inasmuch as
   all duty towards him depends upon remembering him: we can do nothing
   besides if we do not do that Therefore, is that given us as the
   character and diagnostic of wicked men, of men that are designed for
   hell, and allotted to hell for their final and eternal inheritance and
   residence. Ck The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the people
   that forget God." Psalm ix. 17. And they, accordingly, are
   characterised as such, who more peculiarly belong to God, and as those
   whom he owns for his own, and counts his jewels; "In the day that I
   make up my jewels, saith God, they shall be mine:"' Who? why "They that
   feared the Lord, and thought upon his name." Mal. iii. 16, 17. "And the
   desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee."
   This is the profession of his holy ones. Isa. xxvi. 8. And, again we
   may add,

   12. Since God made man, you see how easy it is for him to prevent all
   the evil designs of ill men, if he see good: for they are all his
   creatures: and hath he made a creature that he cannot govern? If then
   we see wicked men, at any time, bring their wicked devices to pass, it
   is not because God cannot rule them; but because he hath deeper designs
   that they understand not, and we understand not. And therefore, their
   insolency, and good men's despondency, upon that account, are equally
   unreasonable. They triumph; and good men are dejected; their hearts
   sink, and they hang down their heads; and why? be cause wicked men
   prevail, and prosper in their way, many times, ages together; and, it
   may be, in many parts of the world. But,

   (1.) Their confidence, on the one hand, is so unreasonable as to be
   even ridiculous. "He that sitteth in the heavens, laughs, the Most High
   hath them in derision." A company of bubbles of being, that I can let
   drop into nothing in a moment, if I please: and yet they please
   themselves in the hopes and imaginations of succeeding in such and such
   designs as they have laid.' "He that sitteth in the heavens shall
   laugh" at them. He knows how soon he can let such bubbles drop into
   nothing; and he sees that their day is coming. And,

   (2.) Good men's despondency is, upon this account, equally
   unreasonable. "Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, that the
   everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth,
   fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no searching of his
   understanding." Isai. xl. 28. Thou dost not know the counsels of God,
   what that all-comprehending mind and understanding of his doth design,
   in letting creatures awhile run such a course. But we are to be
   assured, he hath his own creatures in his own hand and power, both men
   and devils, and can govern them as he pleaseth. He hath a hook in their
   nostrils, that they themselves are unapprehensible of. He knows their
   coming in, and their going out, (as he said of that proud Assyrian,)
   and even all the rage which they have against him. But, I say, he hath
   a hook in their nostrils, and can turn them as he pleaseth, and when he
   will: we shall have done a great thing towards the whole business of
   our religion if we can but get this truth impressed upon, and deeply
   wrought into our souls; So God made man; if we will but learn to look
   upon ourselves as made things, and look upon all men as made things,
   continually in the hands, and at the command of their great Creator.

LECTURE XIX. [34]

   Gen. i. 27.

   So God created Man in his own Image.

   WE have treated of the first thing, to wit, this creation itself. So
   God made, or created man. And now,

   II. We come to speak of the norma or pattern of this work of his; or
   the estate wherein man was created; in his own image; which is
   mentioned with a reduplication; "in the image of God created he him;"
   and this we shall speak to briefly, by way of explication and
   application.

   1. In the explication, our great business must be, to inquire, and
   shew, wherein stood this image of God, wherein man was created. Theirs
   was a strange and absurd dream, (that of the anthropomophites,) that
   is, they who did ascribe to God a corporeal shape, and supposed man to
   be made like to God in that respect. We know, indeed, that in tract of
   time, our Lord Jesus Christ did assume a human body; but that gives no
   pretence at all to this imagination: for therein he was made like unto
   us, man being the pre-existent pattern, and not we like to him, man
   being made long before. And to ascribe to Deity itself a corporeal
   shape, must needs speak very mean and base thoughts of God, founded in
   gross ignorance, and rising up into a mental blasphemy; and indeed,
   very vile thoughts even of ourselves, as if we were but to imitate God
   in somewhat corporeal.

   Some of the more refined pagans have disclaimed, and declaimed against
   such gross thoughts of God, warning us to take heed of ascribing any
   thing corporeal to him; as one, inquiring how we are to conceive of
   God, according to the doctrine of Plato, (I mean Maximus Tyrius,) he
   tells us, "we must be very shy, and it ought to be most remote from us,
   to ascribe any thing at all corporeal to him, neither shape, nor
   colour, nor magnitude, nor any kind of figure whatsoever: but somewhat
   of that high excellency as neither to be seen with eyes, nor felt with
   hands, nor expressed by any words." In some such things we are to
   understand the excellency of the Divine Nature and Being to consist.
   And accordingly, the apostle, discoursing to those Athenian
   philosophers, (Acts xvii.) supposeth them very capable of understanding
   so much as this; he quotes one of their own poets for it, that "we are
   God's off spring." "And forasmuch," saith he, "as we are the offspring
   of God, we cannot conceive the Godhead to be like any corporeal thing
   of never so great excellency;" as silver or gold, of which some
   corporeal shape or resemblance may be made, or stands never so
   curiously graven by the art or device of man: we must understand our
   resemblance to him, as we are his off spring, to lie in some higher,
   more noble, and more excellent thing, of which there can be no figure;
   as, who can tell how to give the figure or image of a thought, or the
   mind or thinking power? This image therefore, must principally lie in
   some mental thing, and is to be only mentally understood: that is, it
   must have its seat and subject in the soul and spirit of man itself:
   and so we must know this image of God in man, wherein he was made, to
   be twofold; natural and moral.

   (1.) Natural, standing in such things as wherein the very nature and
   essence of man's soul and spirit doth consist and lie. As,

   [1.] In spirituality: the soul of man is a spirit, as God himself is a
   spirit. He, the paternal Spirit, (as a heathen very aptly speaks of,)
   the fatherly Mind; and agreeably to that, we are his offspring, he
   being the Father of spirits.

   [2.] And in life; essential life. We have bodies that live a borrowed
   life. Our spirits are, themselves, living things in their own nature
   and essence; so that life is inseparable from them, as it is not
   inseparable from our bodies; for our bodies can die; but our souls
   cannot. IF it be, it lives: being and life are the self-same thing. As
   the blessed God is so frequently spoken of in Scripture, "the living
   God," the original well-spring of life; so making a creature like
   himself, and in his own image, he makes him to be such as to whom life
   should be essential, though it be dependant upon him, (as all being
   must be,) yet life being made so much of the essence of man's soul that
   it can never be severed from it; therein its life is like the divine
   life; that is, it is an immortal life. It is true, "he only hath
   immortality;" that is, he only hath an original, independent
   immortality. But the souls of men, and all created spirits, have a
   dependant immortality, together with their dependant being, and not
   separable from it. And,

   [3.] In the power of understanding; therein doth the soul of man bear
   the image of God naturally, as it is an intelligent thing, a thing that
   hath a power to understand and know the impress of God is upon the
   spirit of man in this. "He that teacheth men knowledge, shall not he
   know?" Psalm xciv. 10. And he that declareth unto man his thoughts, (as
   having given him the thinking and the knowing power,) are we not to
   suppose, he should know his own work? And,

   [4.] In liberty, or the power of willing this or that; of acting or
   suspending its own acts, and of acting this way or that, accordingly as
   it shall chuse; a dominion it hath over its own act, a self-determining
   power, or self-dominion; but subordinate to the divine dominion; for he
   never made a creature that he was not to govern. These are things that
   I now mention, but which being included in the nature and essence of
   man, when I gave you an account of this creature man, which God is said
   to have made.

   I shall only add two things more generally concerning this natural
   image of God in man.

   First. That it is permanent and lasts always, as long as man lasts, as
   it cannot but do, it being essential to him, or his very nature: for
   his very nature did resemble the divine, "the image and glory of God,"
   as he is called 1 Cor. xi. 7. It must, therefore, be permanent, and can
   never be severed from man; this is an image that could not be lost. Man
   could not lose this image; his soul must be a spirit still; a living
   thing still; and an understanding thing still; a spontaneous, free
   thing still, subject only to the divine government. And therefore,
   considering man, even in his estate of apostasy, we find this image of
   God, still remaining, as the perpetual reason of that law of preserving
   the life of man in this body, as in the 9. Gen. 6. "Whosoever sheddeth
   man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God
   made he man." If the reason of the law were lost, the law were lost,
   and would cease: but plain it is, the law was made with reference to
   man, already fallen: fallen man, apostate man, still bears, in that
   respect, the image of God; therefore, he will not have his life to be
   touched. He is a Godlike creature, and he that strikes at the life of
   man, strikes at the image of God! A very awful thought, to consider
   that man, even as he is man, while he was in innocency, or in apostasy,
   is still the image of God, and therefore, must be in violable, not to
   be touched beyond his rules, who reserves to himself still, the
   dominion over lives, as being the God of our lives, so as to kill or to
   make alive, either immediately, or mediately, by his own authority in
   men, but not otherwise. And,

   Secondly. There is this to be said in general, too, concerning the
   natural image of God in man; as it is permanent, so it is fundamental
   unto the other image, and the contraries thereunto; that is, if man had
   not the natural image of God upon him, he were never capable of having
   a moral image, could never be a holy creature, nor unholy, if he were
   not naturally such a creature. And he could never be happy or
   miserable, if he were not such a creature: that is, if he had not a
   soul that were a spirit, and that were a living thing, and that were
   intelligent, and that were capable of acting voluntarily and by choice.
   And therefore, this image must still be presupposed unto the other.

   (2.) Which other we now go on to speak of, that is, the moral image of
   God in man, founded on the former. And so man doth bear, and did
   originally bear, the image of God, in the moral sense, in these two
   respects--first, in purity--secondly, in felicity. He did at first
   resemble God as a holy, and as a happy Being. In reference to both
   these, the natural image of God was fundamental to the moral; this was
   the very foundation in him of all duty, and of all felicity; and of the
   contraries thereunto, that is, of sins and of misery; as contraries
   must always have the same subject in which they take place,
   successively, or in a remiss degree.

   [1.] This image of God in man, which we call moral, superadded to his
   natural image, stood in this, to wit, in the sanctity and holiness of
   this creature in his original state; the rectitude of his natural
   powers and faculties with reference to his rule and end. But this is to
   be understood with caution. We are to take heed of asserting either too
   much, or too little, concerning the holiness of man's original state.
   We must take heed of asserting too much concerning it, to wit, so much
   as would not consist with the possibility of his falling; or too
   little, to wit, what would not consist with the possibility of his
   standing. But, in general, this sanctity or holiness wherewith man was
   made, and wherein he did originally resemble God, it stood in these two
   things;

   First. In innocency; that is, that he was made perfectly innocent, and
   it was impossible that it should not be so: for it could not consist
   with the holiness, and the other perfections of the Divine Being, to
   make him a sinner. He could not come out of the hand of God at first,
   an impure and unholy thing. Wherein stood the image of God, but in that
   he was originally holy, as God is holy? to wit, in some similitude to
   the holiness of God: he was created in this, as part of the image of
   him that created him, as that Col. iii. 10. and Ephes. iv. 24. do
   plainly imply: for the image of God restored and renewed must be the
   image that was lost. It could not be a specifically different thing:
   therefore, when the soul is renewed after this image, it is plain, that
   he was created in it; that is, was created an innocent and sinless
   creature: not barely in the negative sense; for so is a stone or a
   brute innocent. I say, not in that sense only; but as being free from
   all taint and impurity, when he was a capable subject of being both
   pure and impure; which a stone or other unintelligent creature was not.
   And then,

   Secondly. This holiness, wherein man was created, as it did include
   innocency, freedom from any taint of sin; so it did include a
   possibility of continuing so; that is, that there was no depraved
   inclination in his nature, as it was made or created by God, to
   determine him unto sin; unto any sinful thought, or to any sinful act.
   It is true, he was not made impeccable, or with an impossibility of
   sinning, yet he was made with a possibility of not sinning; that is,
   with an intrinsical possibility thereof: for we must distinguish here,
   between possibility and futurity. It is true, that his fall was future;
   but his standing, for all that, was possible; we mean only by it, a
   simple possibility, not compounded with any consideration of God's
   foreknowledge. It is true, God did foreknow what would become of man;
   but that did not infer a necessity upon his nature; that could have no
   influence to make him fall; that is, that God foresaw, that being left
   to himself he would fall; but he saw at the same time, that though he
   would fall, yet that he had done that for him by which it was possible
   for him to have stood, if he had followed the law of his own nature.
   And therefore, though we call this image moral, in contradistinction to
   natural, yet we are not to think that it was in no sense natural; for
   it was con-natural. It was not natural, as that signifies essential;
   for then it could not have been lost: but as it signifies somewhat
   agreeable to the nature of man; and nothing could be more agreeable to
   his nature, than to have continued still an obedient creature to God,
   and consequently happy in him: so that it was not at all to be ascribed
   to man's nature that he fell; for that were to resolve the cause of his
   fall into the Author of his nature; and so, to cast all upon God at
   length; whereas, man's destruction is only of himself, he is the
   fountain of whatsoever is evil, and God the only fountain of all good.

   But then, we are to consider the holiness wherewith man was created,
   more particularly. And so, it stood in the confirmation, or the
   conforming of the faculties of his soul unto the rule and order wherein
   God did at first set them; that is, as for the mind and understanding,
   it did agree with the Divine Mind; and for his will, it did agree with
   the Divine Will; and so, the faculties of the human soul, those two
   great leading faculties, the mind and the will, did each of them bear
   the stamp and impress of God upon them. And therefore, whereas, we find
   God spoken of under that twofold notion in Scripture, and by one and
   the same penman of the holy Scripture, the evangelist John, in his 1st
   epistle, that "God is light," and that "God is love;" the one in the
   1st chap. verse 5, and the other in the 4th chap. the 8th and 16th
   verses. Such a creature was man in his mind, and in his will, conformed
   to the Divine Mind and Will.

   i. "God is light," saith the apostle, "and with him is no darkness at
   all; and he that walks in darkness, and saith, he hath fellowship with
   God, lies:" there can be no fellowship between light and darkness. We
   are not to understand light, there, to mean merely speculative
   knowledge: but we are to understand it as signifying practical
   principles, lodged in the mind, and which are most con-natural to
   holiness in the will and heart. They are the ideas contained in the
   one, which are exemplified in the other. So, "God is light." essential
   light itself; and so was the spirit of man, "the inspiration of the
   Almighty having given it understanding;'' that is, that it was,

   (i.) A knowing thing; not only had a power to know, but did actually
   know all that concerned him to know, or that it was his duty to know.
   And as such, this part of the divine image is referred to morality; for
   there are some things which it is our duty to know; and to be ignorant
   of them is a sin. But we are not to suppose man to be destitute of any
   knowledge, that he ought to have had, in the state of his primitive
   innocency; though it must be far from us to think that he had universal
   knowledge, that he knew all things: for that would still be proper to
   God as an incommunicable attribute of the Divine Nature. And therefore,
   his knowledge must have been a growing thing in that state wherein he
   was made. But he did know all that did belong to him to know, for the
   state wherein he was. And so are we to conceive of that knowledge, as
   the moral additament to the faculty or power of knowing, which is
   natural. And then,

   ii. Besides his actual knowledge, we must understand, in his mind, a
   docility, or an aptitude to learn, or know more; and still more,
   according as the Creator should vouchsafe to reveal more to him, or as
   he should give him opportunity (as he had given him a natural ability)
   to reason himself from the knowledge of some things into the knowledge
   of more.

   (ii.) For his will, that must have been the seat too, of the holiness
   wherein the image of God stood, and wherein he did resemble God; and
   there is the seat of God's law impressed: for we must know, that man
   was made at first with the law of God written in his heart. Besides the
   positive precept which he transgressed, there was the whole frame of
   that whole law in him, which was to be the permanent rule of his
   practice and obedience: for the apostle, speaking of man in his fallen
   state, (Rom. ii. 15.) tells us, "that even pagans themselves." (where
   there are the greatest ruins of the human nature to be seen,) "even
   they have the law written on their hearts." And if it be so with fallen
   man, what an entire impression must there have been of the divine law
   upon the mind of man yet in his integrity. A law written in his heart,
   of which some pagans speak, calling it the non scripta, sed nata Lex,
   not a law written, (that is, in any external scripture,) but an
   engraven law, an innate law, that was impressed on man on his creation,
   or that he was made with.

   And so, as this law which, is in itself, of universal and ever lasting
   obligation, is all summed up in love, which is the fulfilling of the
   law; why, therein we must understand this creature to have at first
   resembled God; that is, as God is said to be "light," so he was in
   respect of his mind: and as God is said to be "love," so he was in
   respect of his will or heart: a creature made up of love, which sums up
   all duty; for "love is the fulfilling of the law." And therefore, when
   men are renewed and brought back to God, and his image restored in
   them, they are created after God in this respect, so as to be capable
   of dwelling in love as in a proper element and region connatural to
   them. This was the great principle that did conform men to both parts
   of the law; that part which was to respect God himself; and that part
   which was to respect men towards one another: for these were the two
   great natural and moral precepts; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
   with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might; and
   thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." O! what an excellent state
   was this! when the impression of this law, whereof this was the
   summary, was entire and perfect; not the least inclination to violate
   it in any part, or in any point, either towards God, or towards a
   fellow creature.

   And we may yet further, and more distinctly, consider this rectitude of
   the faculties of man's soul to stand in this--first, that the superior
   faculties of his mind and will, were more directly and exactly
   conformed to the divine mind and will--and secondly, that the inferior
   faculties were subject to the superior; this being the law of man's
   nature at first; that is, that though he had inferior faculties, as
   well as superior, suitable to his compounded nature, (being made up of
   an inward man, and of an outward man, or of an intellectual, and of a
   sensitive nature,) yet, these inferior faculties belonging to the
   sensitive nature, they were made so as to be obedient and subject to
   the superior; that is, to an enlightened mind, and to a holy will: so
   as to have no appetitions that were irregular or disorderly, of an
   inferior kind, or belonging to the sphere of sense, but what reason,
   governing the will, could prescribe to: no violent passions or
   appetitions in one kind or other, so as to love or desire, or fear, or
   hope, or joy, or sorrow, or be angry inordinately, but according as a
   right mind should dictate, and as a right mind should command. And
   then,

   [2.] As this moral image, superadded to the natural, and founded
   thereon, stood in holiness, (which we have thus far explained,) so it
   stood in happiness too, in sanctity and felicity; that is, as God is
   the blessed God for ever, so did this creature imitate him in his
   blessedness; bear the image of that upon him too. We must understand
   that he had a present inchoate blessedness; a present blessedness begun
   in a satisfaction to all his faculties, in having what was
   proportionable and accommodate to all the powers of his nature.

   First. As to his superior faculties: herein stood the blessedness of
   this creature, that he had a mind capable of knowing God, and a will
   capable of enjoying him; and which did know God, and which did actually
   enjoy him: and it could not hut be so; for here was no culpable
   darkness or cloud upon this mind; there was no corrupt or depraved
   inclination in this will: and God was pleased to exhibit himself, and
   manifest himself, to make himself known, and to offer himself to be his
   portion and God, according to the tenour of that covenant, that law of
   works, and that law of his creation, under which he was made. There
   fore, there was nothing to hinder his present happiness: there was no
   aversion from God, no disinclination to him; but, a steady propension
   towards him. There was no guilt upon him, to make him afraid of
   approaching God; as it was with him soon after he fell, when he ran and
   hid himself. Vain creature! thinking there would he some darkness
   wherein he could hide himself from the Divine Majesty. But while he
   remained yet in his integrity, as there was no faulty darkness in his
   mind, so there was no depraved inclination in his will: but knowing God
   to be the best and highest Good, most absolutely perfect,
   all-comprehending and every way suitable to him, his will could not but
   be a propense towards him accordingly, so as the it must have been his
   sense in perfection, (though not unalterably,) which comes to be the
   sense again of the renewed soul: "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and
   whom can I desire on earth besides thee?" When he had the beauties of a
   new-made creation all in view, a heaven that was then new, and an earth
   that was then new; yet, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and what is
   thereupon earth that I desire besides thee?"

   As to his inferior faculties, there was what was most grateful to them
   too. Man was created in a paradise, full of pleasantness, and of
   pleasant good things, which it was then lawful for him to enjoy without
   restraint, except that one forbid den tree. And he not only had the
   perception of all, all grateful, sensible good, but an interest in, and
   a power over, all. And you see, that God estates him in a dominion,
   sets him over all the works of his hands, in this inferior, lower
   world, and doth so, immediately upon his having created him. "God
   blessed them, and said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and
   replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of
   the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every thing that moveth
   upon the earth."

   What a glorious prince was man then! and into how great a principality
   did God put him as soon as he made him! Whatsoever was most suitable,
   and most delectable, for his enjoyment, in that kind of inferior and
   sensible good, was all put into his power; so as what innocent,
   well-tempered nature would choose, as most grateful to it, that he
   might choose, one thing excepted; which very exception, (as all
   exceptions do firmare regulas,) was but a confirmation of his dominion
   over all the rest; and did but more fully speak his right and title to
   enjoy what he would beside. All this as to his inchoate happiness. But,

   Secondly. Besides this, we must understand him to have had a title to
   continuing and increasing and, at length, perfect felicity. We are not
   to suppose him made in that state, which, if it had stood, should have
   been eternal, without change or alteration. But most rational it was,
   that God having newly created an intelligent creature, should create
   him in a state of probation, upon which was to follow a state of
   retribution; as it is most natural, that duty go before felicity: that
   there must be obedience before recompence. His full and final
   recompence was yet to come.

   And the reason of the thing plainly speaks it. We cannot suppose, that
   God made man in a better condition than he made the angels: (a superior
   sort of creatures:) but it is plain, that he created them in a state of
   probation; otherwise it had been impossible that some of them should
   have fallen, and left their first station, forsaken it, and thereupon,
   to be "bound in chains of darkness, and reserved to the judgment of the
   great day." And it is plain, further, upon this account too; as to this
   earth, supposing man to have stood, (though God foresaw that he would
   not; that he would fall,) yet we must suppose his constitution to be
   such, as agree with the supposition of his standing too. It had been
   altogether impossible that, in the succession of many ages, this world
   would have contained all the men, if they had been innocent; and so,
   consequently, all immortal. But we must necessarily suppose, though not
   death, (for that was only introduced by sin,) yet some such kind of
   translation unto higher and more glorious regions; as from perfect
   arbitrary, good pleasure, Enoch and Elijah found at the hand of God,

   And so, besides the actual felicity he had, there was a title to.
   future felicity, supposing he had stood. For when the divine
   constitution runs in this tenour, "Cursed is he that continueth not in
   all things that are written in the book of the law to do them," do hut
   consider what the reverse of that must be: "Blessed is he that
   continueth in all things written in the book of the law to do them." If
   not continuing in all things writ ten in God's law, to do them, must
   infer a curse, then to have continued must infer a blessing: and as
   that curse did put him into a worse estate, that blessing must have put
   him into a better estate; otherwise, it had not been a state of
   retribution suitable to a foregoing state of probation.

   Thus far, you have now the explication of this state, wherein God is
   said at first to have made man; that is, made him in his own image, the
   image that was natural and essential to man; and that image that was
   moral and superadded. And can we look upon this as a useless doctrine?
   Of what importance is it to us to look back, and consider the original
   of this creature! what it was; and what it is! What man was in that
   perfect rectitude, of which we have had some account; and what he is in
   that forlorn and abject state into which he is now sunk and fallen. It
   is this that must make redeeming mercy, and our recovery by a mediator
   grateful. It was a noble expression of a heathen; Nemo improbe conatur
   unde descenderat ascendere: (speaking to this very case, the depraved
   condition of man as he now generally is, and what his state before was,
   of which they had hallucinations, though not distinct conceptions;) no
   man blameably endeavours to ascend from whence he did descend. Capax
   est noster animus dei, atque eo fertur, nisi vitia deprimant: we have
   minds capable of God; and towards him they would be carried if vice did
   not depress and sink them. But nobody doth unwarrantably aim to ascend
   thither, whence he did descend; if he did descend, sink from so
   excellent a state, there must be some aim upwards, some aspiring to get
   up to that state again, or to somewhat agreeable thereto, by which the
   natural appetite in man to blessedness and felicity should be excited
   and stirred and put into action, and kept in action, even by the very
   law of his own nature.

LECTURE XX. [35]

   The more distinct Use and application of this subject, and such as may
   most aptly and properly be made, we shall now proceed to. And it will
   afford us a very various, and a very copious use, if we seriously apply
   our minds to consider it. God created man in his own Image. Why there
   are,

   1. Sundry inferences of truth that we may collect and deduce. As, that
   man was, at first, a creature of great excellency, (whatsoever he is
   now become,) a noble and a glorious creature; the image of God being
   intire could not, sure, but be a very glorious thing. As it is blurred
   and defaced in a great measure, yet in respect of that remainder, or
   that mere ground of it, man is now said to be "the image and glory of
   God." 1 Cor. xi. 7 The image and glory of God, he is still,
   notwithstanding he hath diminished and disguised himself, as an
   intelligent being, a living thing: he hath a soul that is essentially
   life, or to which life is essential; that cannot cease to live; that
   hath a self-determining power belonging to its nature; that acts not
   under the laws of a fatal necessity, but according to reason and
   liberty, in the common affairs and actions of life.

   Take man as he was at first, when those powers that belonged to his
   nature were unvitiated and pure, what a glorious creature was this
   creature! Dei-formed, made after the likeness of God. The world
   replenished with such creatures, what a delectable habitation had it
   been! to have so many Godlike creatures inhabiting this world of ours,
   all representing God to one another, so many visible representations of
   divine knowledge, and divine light, and divine love and divine purity!
   O! what an excellent creature was man in his original state!

   (2.) We may further be informed, hence, of the more peculiar excellency
   of our souls: for we must consider them as the primary seat of the
   divine image: "So God made man after his own image." Wherein stood
   that? Where lay this image, or where was it seated? What! in our bodily
   frame and structure? (as the anthropomorphites did formerly dream.) Was
   it a piece of clay that was made so like God in us? And therefore, if
   man be to be looked upon as an excellent sort of creature, we must
   understand wherein his true value lies, and whereupon men are to value
   themselves.

   A great many are apt to value themselves because they have laden
   themselves with a great deal of thick clay; because they have a sort of
   propriety in much of this earth. Some highly value themselves upon an
   airy title: "I am such and such a dignified thing, among those with
   whom I dwell." Some are more vain to value themselves upon gay apparel,
   or because they have so and so trimmed and adorned those carcasses: but
   it is in respect of our mind and spirit, that we are the offspring of
   God, and bear the image of God: and if ever we have any thing truly
   valuable, or excellent about us, there it must lie; a mind and spirit
   must be the seat and subject of it. Again,

   (3.) We may learn, hence, that there is much of God to be understood by
   ourselves; for we were made after God's own image; and we may discern
   much of another thing by that which is really like it. Indeed, to
   direct the intention of our minds immediately towards God, is that
   which we are not so well capable of in this present state. The
   intuition of his glory, our weak minds cannot admit of: "No man can see
   my face and live." saith God to Moses. But we can see our own faces;
   that is, the face of our own souls: we can take a view of them, and
   consider what naturally, and in themselves, they are: that is,
   according to what there remains of true primitive nature in us; and so
   may discern and understand much of God, as his glory is reflected on
   ourselves.

   Though we know not how to face the sun when it shines in its strength
   and glory, yet we can sustain it to behold its image in the water, and
   look upon it there. So we cannot bear it, to behold the immediate
   radiations of divine glory directly shining forth, but reflected; and
   as it hath produced its image in ourselves, so we may be capable of
   beholding it. And by what we see in ourselves, when we understand that
   we are made after God's image, that there is a thing called mind in
   ourselves, then God must be a mind; there is a spirit in man, and we
   are his offspring: then he, sure, must be a spirit too; but an
   infinite, purer, and more perfect Spirit. If we find such a thing as
   love in our own natures, we may be sure that it is infinitely higher,
   and greater, and larger, and more perfect, every way, in God. But
   again,

   (4.) We may further learn hence, that upon the account o our being made
   after God's image, we have much the less reason to hesitate at the
   receiving of that most mysterious doctrine of the Trinity in the
   Godhead: for if we seriously consider, we may discern the image and
   impress thereof in ourselves: and we find that we are made after God's
   image. There is none that doth so seriously contemplate himself, his
   own soul, but he may and must discern and acknowledge a trinity there;
   those primary principles which, considered in their conjunction, do
   carry a most manifest and express representation of God in this
   respect;" to wit, active power, intellect, and love, those three great
   primalities in God, his word (who best knows his own nature) doth, upon
   all occasions, repeatedly express and inculcate to us. And the very
   like hereof we find in ourselves, considering these things in
   ourselves; not severed but conjunct: that is, a power to act, and to
   act according to understanding; and so act towards things that we love;
   and towards which there is a propension from a suitableness in
   ourselves to the things' that we act towards.

   Any one that will make himself his own study, must discern and
   acknowledge such things in himself as do make a real trinity; one and
   the same soul having active power belonging to it, understanding
   belonging to it, and love belonging to it, which, though all meet and
   unite in one and the same soul, are yet diverse and distinct from one
   another; for my power is not my understanding, and my understanding is
   not love; but all these do meet together in one and the same soul. So
   that considering man made after the image of God, the doctrine of the
   Trinity claims to be received with so much the more facility and
   agreeableness; we finding, so manifestly, the impress thereof upon our
   own souls. And so we may upon many things in the created universe
   besides; yea, and we may find running through all things; but most
   manifestly and discernably in ourselves, concerning whom it is most
   eminently said, that "we were made after God's image." Again,

   (5.) We may further learn, hence, that since man was made after the
   image of God, (so excellent and noble a creature as this image
   impressed upon him, must speak him and make him,) then sure, God did,
   in making this creature, design him for higher and greater things than
   can be compassed within this temporary state. He never did design, in
   making such a creature as man, to confine him to time and to this lower
   world. For as he is a creature made after the image of God, he is made
   with capacities of far higher and greater things than this world can
   contain, or than time can measure.

   If we look upon the present inhabitants of this world, so many minds
   and spirits inhabiting flesh, and cast about our eyes this way and that
   way, how thick is this same material world? how thick is it set with
   minds, with spirits, as so many diamonds sparkling in mud? Any one
   would say, "This is not their proper place: here are so many diamonds
   scattered here and there in dirt; surely they are not always to be
   there! Spiritual and immortal minds inhabiting flesh, and only casting
   their present rays upon low and sensible things; surely it will not
   always be thus." Did God make such creatures, did he make man, after
   his own likeness, for so mean and so low ends and purposes, as they are
   every where intent upon in this their present state? Did he make man
   after his own image, only to support and animate a little portion of
   breathing clay? Did he make him only to take this flesh to keep it
   awhile from turning into a putrid, stinking carcass. Was this all that
   a spiritual, immortal mind was made for?

   Men should understand, by reflecting upon their original state, what
   the capacity of their nature was; and that they must be made for some
   other state, and for higher and greater things, than they commonly
   apply themselves to mind while they are here. You have so many minds
   dwelling in flesh; and many, but for a very little while. But suppose
   it, as long as men do more ordinarily live upon earth, why to have a
   mind, a spirit, created and put into flesh to inhabit that, suppose
   twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, or sixty years, or to the utmost
   pitch that the lives of men do commonly reach to; and then that
   creature disappears and is gone. That flesh which that mind inhabiteth,
   turns to dust; the soul is fled and gone: here is no more appearance of
   this creature, this particular creature, upon this particular stage:
   what are we to conclude upon this then? But that sure these have their
   parts to act in another state, upon an eternal stage, that shall never
   be taken down. Here are so many Godlike creatures brought into this
   world, and put in flesh, only to abide here such a certain number of
   years, and there is an end of them. This can never be thought, that God
   did make so many creatures after his own image, for so mean and
   ungodlike ends and purposes. And again,

   (6.) We may further learn, hence, that an abode in the flesh, is not
   inconsistent with a very excellent state of life; for God did at first
   make man after his own image, of whose creation, as to the outward man,
   (of which I spake to you distinctly,) we are told, he was only made (as
   his name Adam doth import) out of the earth; but God breathed into him
   the breath of life, that intellectual vital life: he placed that spirit
   in him, by the inspiration whereof he came to be an understanding
   creature; and therein to resemble him that made him. Though this mind
   and spirit was to dwell in flesh, yet a very excellent state of life
   might be transacted here in this state: for admit that a mind and
   spirit be united with such flesh as we now inhabit and dwell in, yet
   here it hath the image of God entire and undepraved in it: not only a
   capacity of understanding, and of willing, and of acting, this way and
   that, but of doing all these aright, with a due rectitude adhering to
   each faculty; not remotely, not inseparably, as the sad events have
   shewn; but really and truly, so as that they might have remained in the
   state wherein they were made. O! then, how excellent a life might have
   been lived here, on these terms, in this world.

   Though our likeness to God did not consist in this fleshly part of
   ours, or had not that for its seat and subject, yet it might very well
   consist with our having such a fleshly part about us, when there was
   pure and incorrupt integrity in all the powers and faculties of the
   soul of man: to have his soul replenished with the knowledge of God;
   possessed with a holy and adoring disposition, in a continual aptitude
   to look to, and a continual inclination to delight in, God, and in his
   converse; together with a universal love to one another, under that
   notion of being made after the image of God, as they should behold
   God's resemblance in one another. And O! what a happy world were this,
   and how pleasantly, and with what delight, might time have been
   transacted here: a very pleasant, happy, excellent state of life might
   consist with dwelling in flesh.

   Such, in whom the image of God, to wit, his moral image, hath been
   (though less perfectly) restored, yet how pleasantly have they lived
   here in this world, amidst all the abounding wickedness of it: such a
   man as Noah; such a one as Enoch, who walked with God so many hundred
   years in this world. This is not to live an unhappy life, to walk with
   God every day, to live in his fear, and live in his communion. Is this
   to live unhappily?

   Men are apt to transfer all the causes of their complaint to other
   things, and set them at a remote distance from themselves. Some, when
   they do evil, or evil befal them, accuse their stars or external
   circumstances. But we have nothing to accuse but our own ill
   inclinations. If we live evil lives, bad and sinful lives, or miserable
   lives, in this world, it is our own fault: for mere dwelling in flesh
   imposeth no necessity upon us, of being either sinful or miserable
   creatures. And that we might be convinced of this, we have the
   exemplification of such a life in our blessed Lord living in flesh
   (after all flesh had corrupted their ways) without taint. Therefore,
   being in flesh, as such, doth necessitate none, either to live wicked
   or miserable lives in this world: the mind and spirit of man being
   stamped with the image of God.

   (7.) If man were at first made after God's own image, he must now,
   sure, be a very degenerate creature; the degeneracy of man must needs
   be exceeding great: how ungodlike a creature is he become! How unlike
   to God do men generally live and act, here in this world. This ought to
   be considered with deep and bitter regret. It is true that the natural
   likeness still remains, as it cannot but do, because it is natural,
   because it is the very nature of man himself. As his mind and spirit
   (being the immediate seal of the divine image) is a living thing, an
   understanding thing, a voluntary, active thing, this way and that, the
   natural image cannot but remain as long as man is man. But the
   degeneracy is with reference to the moral, superadded image; for that
   was at first superadded; and is still due; a thing concerning which we
   must say, it is a Debitum esse; and which, in reference to the natural
   image, is as the more curious lines of a picture are to the first rude
   draught. It is true, that first rude draught, consisting of maimed
   strokes, doth shew the true symmetry and proportion of the parts, in
   such a picture, to one another; but while every thing is yet wanting
   that tends to make up the comeliness and beauty, it is a very
   ungrateful spectacle that a man hath before his eyes in looking upon
   such a thing.

   The natural powers that do belong to the soul of a man, shew his
   original capacity, what he was capable of; then all these capacities
   are to be filled up, as the rude draught of a picture should be, with
   what would add beauty, and the appearance of comeliness and vigour to
   it, as far as the pencil can express that. Here is a capacity in the
   very nature of man, of knowing much; but look upon that understanding
   power divested and destitute of all true knowledge. Here is a will
   capable of choosing, and of enjoying with highest complacency, the best
   and most delectable good; but totally divested of any such propension
   and inclination. And, here is a soul that is a spiritually active
   being; but it is active now any way but towards God, by whom it was
   made. Why in these very ruins of human nature, you may discern what
   originally it was.

   Take the walls of some noble palace, yet standing: we will suppose all
   rooms to remain distinct from one another as they were, but it is
   totally unfurnished. It was inhabited, it may be, by some excellent
   person; but he is gone and hath left it: there was an honourable family
   that lived in splendor there; but they are removed, and now there is
   nothing to be beheld but bare walls: there be the rooms, the several
   apartments, as they were; but inhabited by nothing but owls and
   vultures: a habitation of dragons and serpents. And such is the soul of
   man, destitute of the divine, moral image, and of that holy rectitude
   which was the furniture and ornament of each several faculty and power.

   We may here see what man was in his original state; and hence see and
   collect how great his present degeneracy is. O! how art thou fallen!
   what art thou fallen to, thou Lucifer, son of the morning! A Godlike
   creature, one made after God's image, a little lower than the angels,
   that did so perfectly resemble him; and now sunk into so low a degree
   of darkness, and impurity, and misery, and death: of which also we were
   not capable, if the natural image did not remain, if he had not an
   understanding still, and a will still, and an active power still. And
   then,

   (8.) You may further learn, hence, what the work of regeneration is to
   perform in the souls of men; and of how absolute necessity such a work
   is to be effected and brought about there. So God made man after his
   own image. That plainly tells us what regeneration hath to do; that is,
   to restore that image wherein it was defective and lost. That must be
   the business of regeneration, considering together what the original
   state of man was, made after God's image: and considering what his
   present state is, his degenerate state, it is easy to collect what his
   regenerate state must be; a renovation, a state of renovation after the
   same image that man was impressed with at first, consisting of
   knowledge, (not only in a capacity to know, but in knowledge, )and in
   righteousness and true holiness. Not only in having the faculties that
   are capable of these, but in having these things themselves impressed
   into these faculties: this, regeneration must do: or the restoring us
   to ourselves, or repairing the image of God that was lost; that must be
   the business of regeneration. As man was made after the image of God at
   first, in his first creation; in his second creation, when he is made a
   new creature, he must be created again after God. The new man must be
   put on, "which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness." And this image is renewed in knowledge, as those two texts
   speak, Ephes. iv. 24. and Col. iii. 10. compared. Thus, is this part of
   the doctrine of the text improvable to the learning of several truths
   that do depend upon it, and that lie in connexion with it. Again,

   2. It may be improved too, and very largely, in representing, and
   reprehending, several sinful evils that this wretched world abounds
   with; by which it appears how much men, by sin, have fallen short of
   the glory of God; such characters of his glory having been impressed at
   first upon them. Why, to consider such things as these that too
   evidently, and too commonly appear in the temper of men's minds, and in
   the course of their practice, here in this world: For instance,

   To consider how low designs men do generally drive. What! Is this
   Godlike? Is this becoming a Godlike sort of creatures, such as man was
   at first, when they wear out their days here in this world, and make it
   their business to serve divers lusts and pleasures? What a base kind of
   servitude is this? Is this the creature made after God's image? Men to
   spend their days in the pursuit of shadows and trifles? Is there any
   resemblance of God in this? Is this like a creature that had in his own
   original and primitive state, a representation of divine in it, which
   was to conduct his whole course? And again, consider not only what men
   do pursue, that their minds and hearts are set upon; but (which carries
   more of horror in it) what they decline, and what their minds and
   hearts are set against. Men made after the image of God, and yet
   transacting their course in continual ungodliness. What! Thou made
   after the image of God, and yet an ungodly creature, and yet live an
   ungodly life in this world, when thou hast a soul about thee that can
   know God, that hath a capacity of knowing God, and of choosing him, and
   of loving him, and of delighting in him! That there should be in such a
   creature, stamped at first with the divine image and likeness, a
   disaffection to God; not only no inclination, but disinclination. What!
   disinclination to thine own true Pattern? disaffection to thine own
   Original? Thou wast made like God; why dost thou shun him? Why dost
   thou fly from him? Thou carriest the natural characters of his image
   upon thee whithersoever thou goest. And what! art thou running away
   from God with his image on thee, in the remainders of it? The
   remainders of it thou hast upon thy soul: a mind that can understand, a
   spirit that can and must live; and thou art running away from God with
   his own image upon thee. What a monstrous thing is that! And again,

   3. It might, in the third place, instruct us in several duties that are
   also very congruous and con-natural to this part of the doctrine of
   this text. As,

   (1.) More frequently to look back to our original estate. Such a truth
   as this made known, published to us, standing upon record in the sacred
   volumes, doth continually and repeatedly call upon us to look back, to
   consider and bethink ourselves what we were in our original state, made
   after God's own image, a God-like sort of creatures.

   (2.) It will be our duty, hence, to be now ashamed of ourselves in our
   present degenerate state. It is no shame to a mean creature that was
   always so, to be now so; no shame to a worm that it is a worm; to a
   toad that it is a toad. But that man should become an impure, and a
   poisonous worm, part of the serpent's seed, this is a most shameful
   thing, and ought to be considered with the most confounding shame. We
   should even be startled at ourselves to think what, from such a
   conformity to God, we are now come to. And,

   (3.) It should put us upon inquiring and listening after any means or
   ways of recovery. It would become a thinking creature, (as man
   naturally is) apprehending as even the pagans, (the more refined of
   them generally have,) that men are not now what they were at first. And
   it would put such upon considering, "Is there no way of recovery?" And
   it hath put even pagans themselves (destitute of all revealed light)
   upon many considerations of that kind, insomuch as that we find several
   of them to have written treatises concerning the purgative and ornative
   virtues. It shews us to have a great deal more of stupidity among us,
   than was among pagans themselves, if we have no thoughts about
   restitution, about being restored, about being recovered out of so low
   a state as we find ourselves lapsed into, compared with that which we
   know was original to us. It should make our minds full of thoughts from
   day to day. "Is there no way to become again what once we were?" to
   have minds, and wills, and inclinations, and affections, so rectified
   as we find, and must apprehend to have been, in our first state? Is
   there no way to get into that conformity to God, and acquaintance with
   him, as to be able to lead my life with God, which was the thing most
   agreeable my first state? And one that would use the understanding of a
   man, when he hears of a better state, that was original to him, would
   certainly be upon his inquiries--"Is there no way of recovering, no way
   of getting back into such an estate again?" And again,

   (4.) It should render the gospel very dear to us, that doth so
   expressly reveal to us such a way, wherein the image of God is
   recoverable: and thereupon, converse with him, and a continual
   intercourse with him, are become possible to us. At present, where
   there is no likeness, there can be no converse, no disposition, no
   agreeableness or suitableness. How dear then should that gospel be,
   that is not only God's revelation, but his way and method to bring this
   about. To this end he hath revealed his Christ to us, his first Image,
   his primary Image. He that is said to be "the Image of the invisible
   God, the first-born before all the creation;" in whom his glory shines
   as "the glory of the only begotten of the Father;" the archetypal
   Image, according to which, the Image is to be renewed again in us. That
   gospel that reveals this to us, and which is designed to be God's
   instrument for the making of the impression afresh on our souls, how
   precious should it be to us! For his glory shines through it, as
   through a glass; that, "beholding this glory of the Lord, we may be
   changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of
   the Lord:" since this, I say, is the design of that very gospel under
   which we live, O! how dear should that gospel be to us! By this, the
   image of God may be restored, which hath, in so great a measure, been
   defaced and lost out of our souls. And it again shews it to be our
   duty,

   (5.) To aspire to the highest pitch of that perfection, in conformity
   to God, that these souls of ours are any way capable of; especially,
   that we should be continually aspiring unto the perfection of that
   state from whence we are fallen. Take the forementioned instruction of
   a pagan to that purpose. Whereas some might be apt to imagine, and
   their thoughts might suggest to them, "It is a presumptuous thing for
   me to think of being made like God, to be holy as God is holy, and to
   be blessed as God is blessed," and the like; we should consider what we
   are, that as that heathen said; "It is no fault, no blameable thing in
   any one to endeavour to ascend to that state or pitch, from which he
   did descend; we have a mind capable of God; and it would be carried
   towards him if vice did not depress and sink it. It is therefore matter
   of duty, from the consideration that we are to aim and aspire after
   such a state. I do not aim to be what I was, and what I ought to be, in
   duty towards him that made me, as well as consulting any interest of my
   own, in the first place: for I am first his, before I can consider
   myself as my own: and therefore, in duty towards him, the Author of my
   being, I ought to be aspiring and aiming at this, to have his image
   renewed in me, and to be restored in this respect, to what I was.

IV. The Fall of the First Man, and the Fallen State of Man
     __________________________________________________________________

LECTURE XXI. [36]

   Rom. v. 12.

   Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,
   for that all have sinned.

   YOU know we have, of late, been treating at large of the creation, and
   particularly and more especially, of the creation of man, and his
   original state, as he was created after God's image; not only his
   natural, but his moral image, so as to resemble him, both in holiness
   and blessedness. We come now, from these words, to consider the lapsed,
   degenerate state of man, now grown most unlike to God in both these
   respects; to wit, of purity, and of felicity; sunk into a state of sin,
   and into a state of misery; become a most deplorable, forlorn creature.

   An amazing change! And indeed, it might amaze us, that it doth amaze us
   no more; that we can consider so astonishing a thing as this, with so
   little concern; when it is not a thing remote from us, but incurs our
   observation and sense, unavoidably, every day; whether we look about
   us, or whether we look into ourselves. And it doth so much the more
   need that such a subject should be insisted upon, the lapse of man, and
   the lapsed state into which he is come, and in which he is.

   It is true, indeed, that usually, immediately upon considering that
   subject of the creation, providence useth and is wont to be treated in
   the next place. And that is a method rational enough in some respects.
   But it being my design to speak of the heads of religion as practically
   as God shall enable me; and the providence of God, (when we shall come
   to consider that) being for this purpose, is chiefly to be considered
   as it doth respect man: and the course of his providence towards man,
   having been for almost six thousand years backward, conversant about
   fallen man, lapsed man, whereas it was conversant about innocent man
   but a very little while; it seems to me more reasonable, with reference
   to the design in hand, to consider God's providence (especially when we
   are to consider it in reference to man) rather, first, as conversant
   about fallen man. And so, first, to consider his fall, and that state
   into which he was fallen, rather than to bring in the whole head of a
   discourse about providence, with reference to the very little inch of
   time wherein he stood in innocency.

   And further, too, because the lapsed world of mankind is, as such,
   thereupon, manifestly put into the hands, and under the government of
   the Redeemer, who died, and revived, and rose again, that he might be
   Lord of the living and dead: yea, and not only the lapsed world of
   mankind, but even the whole creation, as a surplusage of remunerative
   dignity and glory, for that free and voluntary susception and
   undertaking of his, it will be, thereupon, most suitable to my design,
   to bring in the consideration of providence, under the mediatory
   kingdom of our Lord, and as it belongs to that vicegerency of his which
   he holds now, not only over this lapsed world, but over the whole
   creation, as by whom all things consist and are held together. And so,
   the discourse of the fall, in reference to this design of mine, very
   fitly intervening, I have chosen to pitch it on this place, from this
   text of Scripture now read.

   In which we may take notice, that there is that which is called a
   protasis, the former part of a sentence, without an apodosis, or latter
   part in form, answering thereunto. Through that rich abundance of
   divine sense wherewith the apostle's mind and understanding did abound,
   and was replenished, it was not so well capable of being comprehended
   and limited by rules of art, or within artificial limits. But yet we
   may take notice too, that in the following verses there is that
   apodosis, the latter part of the intended sentence in substance, most
   fully and most copiously represented; the design of the whole paragraph
   being, in short, this only, to shew that as Adam, the first man, was to
   be a root and fountain of sin and death unto all his seed; so the
   second Adam would be, of righteousness and life to all his seed, there
   being a resemblance in the former of the latter, according to what is
   elsewhere said, that "the first Adam was a figure of him that was to
   come," of the second that was to follow: though, there is not, it is
   true, an absolute and exact parallel or parity, as is never to be
   expected, in such cases, throughout.

   My business will only be with what we call the protasis, the former of
   these parts, and that abstractly and by itself considered, without
   present reference to what follows in the succeeding verses. And so we
   are to shew you, that whereas, according to the tenour of the last
   discourse, man was created after God's image, not only his natural, but
   his moral image, made like him in respect of sanctity and felicity; he
   is now fallen into a state wherein he is most unlike God in these two
   things; to wit, into a state of sin, and into a state of misery. Both
   these, the text expressly represents and lays before us: "By one man
   sin entered into the world, and death by sin."

   Here was the state of the one, the first apostate; he sins -first, and
   thereby becomes miserable. He did represent and resemble God in
   holiness, purity and sanctity; now he is be come a sinner. He did
   represent and resemble God in felicity and blessedness, in perfection
   and fulness of life; (not absolute perfection, it is true, not
   consummate perfection, but a perfection suitable to his present state;)
   and now he is be come a creature lost in death: death immediately
   pursued the sin into which he lapsed and fell.

   And thus it was, not only with the first sinner personally considered,
   but with all that were virtually comprehended in him; the whole
   offspring, the whole progeny: and the same two things have ensued upon
   them all; that is, sin, by that one being introduced, hath spread
   itself over all: and death, that way introduced, hath also diffused
   itself, and equally spread over all: all lost in death, inasmuch as all
   have sinned.

   Very plain it is, that general notices of these things have obtained in
   the pagan world: and some of the more instructed and refined pagans
   have spoken strangely about this; magnifying the original and primitive
   state of man at first; as that it was a state wherein they did partake
   of a divine portion; and wherein they lived in that converse with God;
   and there was among them that righteousness, and that mutual love
   towards one another, as made this world a pleasant region, and most
   delectable habitation. We have large discourses in Plato to this
   purpose; and divers do speak as largely concerning the degenerate state
   of man;--that he is not the creature that he at first was. And they
   speak it with a great and most affectionate lamentation, that there
   should be such a change,

   But yet, they having nothing in reference to these matters to guide
   them, hut either dark or dubious conjectures, or false traditions, they
   could not hut remain very ignorant of much: that is, how long that
   innocent state did continue; and, wanting divine revelation to guide
   them herein, some have drawn forth that state to a vast tract of time,
   speaking of it under the term of the "golden age:" and though it be
   generally acknowledged among them that there is a degeneracy in man,
   yet, how he came to fall, and wherein his fall at first stood, and how
   the dismal effects came to ensue so generally upon man kind; in
   reference to these things, they speak (as it could not but be) as men
   quite in the dark.

   But here we have a most express and punctual account, and as
   comprehensive as we can have, in one text of Scripture, in these words
   of this text; that is, both of the fall of the first man; and then of
   the fallen state of all men: and both these in the mentioned respects,
   sin and death, transgression and the consequent doom.

   And here are, in reference hereto, these three general heads that
   require to be distinctly spoken to--the fall of the first transgressor,
   this one that first sinned; and--the sinful and miserable state of all
   the whole race of men hereupon; and--the consecution of the latter of
   these upon the former, that by one that sinned there should be such a
   diffusion of sin, and consequently of death upon the whole race of men:
   how from the one man's sin whereby it first entered into the world, and
   by which death entered with it, there should be such a transfusion with
   it of sin and death too, through the world. These are the three general
   heads of discourse to be insisted upon. We begin with the first,

   I. The fall of the first man. And in reference thereto, we have these
   four things more distinctly to be spoken to--wherein his sin stood by
   which he fell--how it came to pass that he (an innocent creature, made
   upright, as in that Eccl. vii. 29) should thus transgress--what the
   death was that was threatened and did ensue hereupon; and the dueness
   of this death upon his having once so sinned.

   1. We are to consider his sin in itself, wherein that stood: and it is
   plain,

   (1.) That it stood in the breach of a positive precept, which had said
   to him, that he must by all means abstain from the fruit of such a
   tree; as you see Gen. ii. 16, 17. "Of all the trees of the garden,"
   wherein God had placed and set him, he might freely eat; but of that
   one, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he must by no means eat:
   in the day wherein he did cat of it he must die, fall under death,
   become mortal. There are here, some that would fain imagine another way
   of understanding this whole history of man's fall, whom I shall meet
   with upon a more particular occasion by and by. But this is the first
   step by which man departed from God: to wit, his making bold in an
   interdict, in reference whereto, he had a positive expression of the
   divine pleasure in that signification which God gave him by his mind
   relating to that matter. He having both a liberty given him, and a
   limitation: a liberty--"thou mayest freely eat of all the trees of the
   garden;" and a limitation--"of this one thou mayest not eat:" and that
   interdict enforced by that tremendous sanction, "Eat and die; if thou
   eatest, it will be mortal to thee:" it was a breach of this positive
   law. Take that, (as we shall have occasion to note to you more
   distinctly anon,) I say, take that act of eating in conjunction with
   all the concurrents whatsoever it did lead to, or whatsoever was
   concomitant of that transgressive act. Herein, I say, it first stood,
   the breach of a positive law. But,

   (2,) It did not stand in that alone, but in the violation of the whole
   law of nature too. This positive law, would never have been understood
   or known, if it had not been, some way or other, expressly signified.
   But we must understand a law of nature, besides, to have been given to
   Adam: to wit, by impression upon his heart; for the remains of such a
   law are still to be found in the nature of man, as the apostle in that
   2. Rom. takes notice: "Men do shew the work of the law written in their
   hearts, their consciences either accusing or excusing," or accusing and
   excusing, alternatim, by turns; sometimes accusing, and sometimes
   excusing, as they did comport or not comport, with the dictates of
   their own conscience, which is appointed to be the conservatory of the
   precepts of that law.

   And of this, there are divers celebrated passages among heathens
   themselves, who have called it not a written but a "born law," the non
   scripta, sed nata lex; so Cicero, and divers others, speak much to the
   same purpose. This same law of nature was transgressed in the
   transgression of this positive law, this particular interdictive
   precept, or negative command. For that particular precept had its
   foundation in the universal natural law; that is, this one
   comprehensive law must contain in it all the laws that could be
   supposed; that whatsoever our great Creator should signify to be his
   mind and pleasure, that, his intelligent, reasonable creature should be
   obliged to comply with him in. This sums up the whole law of nature,
   and so cannot but virtually comprehend all positive laws too; when
   once, by any such law, there is a signification given of the divine
   pleasure, and mind, and will, of him that made me: I ought to obey,
   when I know his mind; I ought to be ruled and governed by that
   expression thereof, which he is pleased to afford. This law of nature,
   (comprehensive of all laws) was broken in this transgression; and
   sundry great breaches of it, which strike deep into the very
   foundation, must be contained in this transgression. As for instance,

   Here was contempt of the highest and most indisputable authority. God
   said, "Do not this thing:" the creature saith, "Aye but I will do it."
   God saith, "If thou doest it thou diest:" he saith, "I will do it
   though I die for it." Here was no fearfulness of his displeasure, and
   of his punitive justice, the very sword whereof was drawn, and did
   glitter before his eyes, in the commination and threatening wherewith
   God fenced his law. Here was disbelief of the first eternal truth. Here
   was believing of a creature against the Creator. Whether that were an
   innocent creature, or a fallen creature, though he could not tell, yet
   he could tell it was a creature that spake to him and tempted him: and
   yet, this creature is believed against God; and here was an
   interpretative, constructive saying, "God is a liar; this creature
   speaks more truly than he." Here was vain curiosity, an affectation of
   knowing more than God yet thought fit for his estate. Here was
   impatiency of waiting for God's further most seasonable and opportune
   discovery. Here was discontent with that excellent state in which God
   had set him. Here was pride and ambition; he must be some greater thing
   than God had made him; "Ye shall be as gods." This is contained in it.
   So that we are not to think that the bare act of eating the forbidden
   fruit did constitute all the sin of man. But there are all these horrid
   things complicated and meeting together in it, which made it a sin most
   exceedingly sinful; especially for him that was hitherto in a right
   mind; upon whom clear light shone; no cloud upon his understanding; no
   perverseness hitherto in his will; a power to master the appetite, and
   keep under the otherwise mutinous inclinations of sensitive nature.
   Take all together, and we find, here was not only a transgression of
   the positive precept, but here was also a most manifest breach of the
   natural law, in the greatest and deepest foundations thereof. Now,
   herein stood this sin, which was the first thing to be spoken to about
   that first more general head. But,

   2. We are to consider, next, how this should come to pass, that a
   creature perfectly intelligent, and perfectly holy, yet in his
   integrity should come to be guilty of so horrid a violation of the
   divine law as this. It is an astonishing thing, to think of, or speak
   to; but an account is to be given of it so far as God hath been pleased
   to give it us. And so, to the inquiry, "How came this sin into the
   world by this one man?" we must answer, "It came so as the divine
   history doth inform us." The law given him, you have in the 2 chapter
   of Gen. 16, 17. verses: the violation of it, in the 3 chapter, at
   large, as distinctly as the divine wisdom did think needful for us. And
   so you find several things to concur, and must be understood so to have
   done to the bringing of this matter about, or that there should be such
   a thing as sin thus entering into the world. As,

   (1.) We are to consider herein the divine permission. Most certain it
   is, that God did permit, or otherwise it could not have been. And it is
   easy and obvious to us all to apprehend, that if he had pleased, he
   could easily have hindered it. The event shews that he did permit; for
   it did evince, it did come to pass, and he could easily have prevented
   so dismal an issue, if he had thought fit. But concerning that
   permission; it is true we are to refer it to the divine permission, in
   very great part, to whom it did belong to prescribe, but not to be
   prescribed unto; that he might do what he pleased with his own; give
   more or less of a gracious influence as he saw fit. But we are not to
   ascribe it to his sovereignty alone, or to the absoluteness of his
   power, but to that power of his, guided by the supreme wisdom, that
   discerns all the reasons of things.

   We have, you know, discoursed largely upon that text, "Who worketh all
   things after the counsel of his own will." All things that he doth and
   permits; all things that he suffers and lets his people do: all do fall
   under the determination of the wisest, and deepest, and most righteous
   counsels: nothing is done rashly; nothing incogitantly done, or
   permitted to be done. That, therefore, is to be considered in the first
   place, how it came to pass, that there should be such a transgression
   of the divine law, both positive and natural together God permitted it.
   And,

   (2.) This is further to be considered, that the apostate an gels (who
   made a defection from God) were manifestly apostatized, and had made
   that defection before. They were gone off from God, had made a schism
   in heaven, and forsook their first station. And,

   (3.) Nothing was, hereupon, more obvious, than that they should affect
   to draw this new made creature (man) into a combination and confederacy
   with them, against the rightful, sovereign Lord of all. And,

   (4.) It is plain, that as they were inclined to it, (and easy it was to
   suppose that they would be inclined to it,) so we find that they did
   actually attempt it. It is likely, one of their number and, most
   probably, their prince, the arch-devil; it was he that made this
   attempt. The matter is put into his hands to make trial, whether he can
   draw off this new-made creature from his loyalty, and involve him in
   the same guilt and misery with himself and his companions; and bring
   him under the displeasure and curse of his and their Maker, as they
   were.

   It is very plain, that it was the devil that tempted in, and by, the
   serpent. The Scripture doth expressly call him "the old serpent, the
   devil, and satan," as you see, Rev. xii. 9. That puts the matter out of
   all doubt. And that he might not fright Adam, (who possibly might
   hitherto be ignorant of a superior order of creatures,) by appearing to
   him (as it were) in some angelic form: and Adam very well knowing, that
   there were*not any other men besides himself: therefore, the devil
   slides into the body of the serpent to tempt. I know no reason we have
   to suppose or imagine that the devil did form of condensed air, another
   body like that of the serpent, (though that might be no impossible
   thing to do, as there are frequent instances in following times and
   ages,) but there being such a creature already formed, it is a great
   deal more probable, that he should insinuate and slide into the body of
   that: and how often hath he possessed human bodies, even when they have
   been alive, and sometimes when they have been dead! Histories give us
   many instances of it: and it is, therefore, not at all strange that he
   should possess the body of the serpent for such a purpose as this, and
   some way or other speak in, or by it. He hath spoken in the bodies of
   men, many times, (the stories themselves that we have of that sort
   importing plainly so much,) not making use of their organs of speech,
   but speaking more deeply in them than their organs of speech did lie.
   And so it is not strange, that though such a creature was not naturally
   furnished with the power of speech, yet that he might speak in it, and
   by it.

   And now here it is true, there are those who are so over wise above,
   and beyond, what is written, that they think it a mean thing to
   understand the history of the creation; and then, of the fall of man,
   according to the true literal meaning and import of the words wherein
   it is given. And as they are too wise (I hope) to be our instructors in
   such a case, so I hope we shall not be foolish enough to be instructed
   and taught by them. The apostle himself, if it were mean and low to
   under stand that history in the literal sense, was content to be of
   that low form, when he told us "the serpent beguiled Eve," and "he was
   afraid lest they should be beguiled, as the serpent by his subtilty
   beguiled Eve," 2 Cor. xi. 3. Pray let us content ourselves to be of
   that lower form with the apostle; that is, modestly understand this
   history just as it lies.

   For the history of the creation, some are sick of it, because they
   cannot tell how to reconcile the literal account thereof, in the
   beginning of Genesis, with the philosophy of their Descartes: as if his
   reputation were a thing more studiously to be preserved than that of
   Moses; though, yet, more might be said than hath been, to reconcile
   with rational principles, even the whole history of the creation: and
   it might be discerned even by themselves, if there were not more ill
   will, and an affectation to slur Scripture in the case, than the love
   of reason. Most plain it is, that it is a very ill compliment which
   they put upon Moses, when they would have him to have written the story
   of the creation, and of the fall of man, in that form wherein we find
   it, only to amuse the people over whom he was set: some account or
   other must be given; and such a one as this, would serve their turn,
   and help to awe them, and render them more governable.

   This is the account that some presume to give of this part of the
   divine Revelation: and therein, they express a great deal less
   reverence for, and esteem of, Moses, than some heathens have done:
   Diodorus Siculus, in particular, who magnifies him as one of the wisest
   men that the world hath had. But certainly, as these persons do take
   off all that can be imagined, from the integrity of any honest
   historian, so they did it without any respect to the reputation of his
   wisdom too. For if it were to be supposed that the fidelity of an
   historiographer were to be dispensed and laid aside: and if Moses could
   have obtained of himself to have done that, surely he might easily have
   contrived a more plausible romance than this that is supposed to be
   feigned by him: so as that no man can imagine what should induce him to
   give such a narrative, but only the known revealed truth of the things
   themselves. If one would have deviated from that, it might have been
   with a great deal more speciousness than this hath been.

   And it is, likewise, a very ill compliment that such, too, put upon the
   people of the Jews; yea, and upon all mankind., to suppose that they
   would be capable of being so imposed upon, if there be not evidence in
   the things themselves related to them and reported,

   But it is the greatest slur of all the rest, which they put upon divine
   Revelation, that when that appears and is so manifestly allowed to have
   been written for the instructing of men, it should yet be supposed to
   be written for the cheating of them. It is, therefore, plain and out of
   question, that the devil did tempt this new made creature man, in the
   serpent, into which he insinuated himself to this purpose, unto this
   transgression. And that is the fourth thing we are to consider about
   the manner of this sin coming to pass.

   (5.) And that the devil applied himself to Eve apart (as it is
   apparent) from her husband, when there was not an opportunity of
   consulting with him, she being, though (it may be) not of less clear,
   yet of less strong intellectuals; and in that respect the weaker
   vessel; her, he attempts: for Adam was not deceived, but Eve; that is,
   not first, but she first; and so was made use of as an instrument to
   deceive him, as the apostle tells us: 1 Tim. ii. 14.

   And because time doth allow me to go no further now, let me only close
   what hath been now said, with a caution to that sex: and especially
   those that are in the conjugal relation. Let them consider what God
   hath appointed that relation for. He gave Eve to Adam as a help meet.
   We see what a help she proved; a help to destroy him; a help to undo
   him, and his whole race and progeny; perverting the very end for which
   God appointed that relation. O! let such consider and look to it, that
   are apt to tempt their husbands into sin, because of their relation;
   because of the affection that they hear to them; because of the
   constant opportunity they have to insinuate into them, when their
   pride, and their vanity, and their vindictiveness, very often, must be
   all employed and set on work to draw their relative into sinful
   combinations with them against God, when he appointed them to be helps
   in the relation and capacity wherein they are set. They should be helps
   to duty; helps Godward; helps heavenward; joint helps, walking in the
   way to life. It lies in my way to note this; and let it be seriously
   considered and noted, according to the import and concernment of it.

LECTURE XXII. [37]

   But we are to consider in the next place, and that as the main thing
   more immediately to be considered in this case,

   (6.)The primitive state of human nature, in respect of the morality
   which was founded there, and wherein, or wherewith, man was at first
   created. You may remember, that speaking of that former great head, the
   state of man by creation, from that text which tells us of "God's
   having made him after his own image." and in speaking of the moral
   image of God upon man in his creation, comprehending both sanctity and
   felicity, that there we told you we were neither to lay the matter too
   low, nor too high: not so low as to make it thence apprehensible, that
   the sin of man was intrinsically necessary, however it might be
   extrinsically, with reference to divine foresight; that it should be
   thought intrinsically necessary would be of horrid consequence to
   admit; for that would be to make the Author of his being the Author of
   his sin. Therefore, great care was to be taken, not to lay the matter
   so low as to exclude the intrinsic possibility of man's standing: nor
   again, was it to be laid so high as to exclude the possibility of his
   falling; which the sad event doth shew.

   The matter, therefore, of his fall, is principally to be resolved into
   the estate wherein, upon the account of his morals, he was created;
   that is, that he was made innocent, but not impeccable; he was made a
   sinless creature, but not with an impossibility of sinning: and in
   particular, his mind, it was made apprehensive, very capable of true
   and right notions of things, but not incapable of wrong: it was made
   without error, but not indeceptible, under no present deception as it
   was made, and yet, not under an impossibility of being deceived and
   imposed upon by false representations and colours. And so as to his
   will, it was created without any determination to good; it was made in
   that state of liberty as to be in a certain sort of equipoise,
   according as things should be truly or falsely represented, by the
   leading faculty, to the mind and understanding. And so hereupon,
   according to this original state of human nature, there was a
   possibility remaining of what, no doubt, did ensue. As,

   [1.] Faulty omission in several respects. As,

   First. Of prayer, in the instant and article of temptation. It had been
   a creaturely part in that instant, presently to have looked up; "Lord I
   am thy creature, the work of thine hands, leave me not to err in such a
   critical season as this." And again,

   Secondly. Of dependance. The creature, as such, was by the law of his
   creation obliged to depend; that is, a reasonable creature capable of
   being governed by a law, was obliged to an intelligent, voluntary
   dependance, as all creatures, as creatures, have a natural dependance:
   and it cannot be otherwise with any of them. There should, by such a
   dependance, have been a derivation and drawing in a sustaining,
   strengthening influence, de novo, as the exigency of such a case did
   require.

   Thirdly. And of consideration. There was, no doubt, an omission of
   that; that he did not use the understanding power and faculty that God
   had endued his nature with, to ponder, and weigh, and balance things in
   that juncture of time. He being essentially, as to his mind and spirit,
   a thinking creature, should have used thoughts with more equity; that
   is, have balanced things on the one hand and the other. And this, it is
   plain, was not done. And there was no doubt,

   Fourthly. An omission of the exercise of the great principle of love,
   which could not hut be most connatural to such a creature: love to God,
   love to himself, love to his posterity. This principle was not excited
   and drawn forth into act and exercise, as it ought, in such an
   exigency, to have been. And this, as easily made way for,

   [2.] Faulty commissions even in the inward man, mental and cordial ones
   in the mind, and in the heart. As,

   First. The allowing himself to aim at greater measures of knowledge,
   than God had yet thought fit for him: whereas, he should have been
   content with a state in which God had set him in this respect, and have
   waited for his further manifestations to him, of what it was fit and
   convenient for him to know. It is plain, the temptation was specious
   unto the cognitive power of man: "Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
   evil;" a very plausible temptation to a creature made capable of
   knowing much, and therefore, could not but have a desire (suitable to
   such a capacity) of knowing more than he yet did. He might easily
   apprehend that this his state, in this respect, was not so perfect,
   though it was not sinfully imperfect. He was guilty of no culpable and
   blameable ignorance before; but not endued with so much knowledge, but
   that he could easily apprehend it might grow. But it was to have grown
   in a regular way; partly by his own improvement of his reasoning power;
   and partly by a patient expectation of God's further manifestations and
   discoveries to him. But he complies with the temptation that thus is
   given to his cognitive faculty, catching at a sudden power of knowing,
   beyond what belonged to his compass, and was within his reach, by
   ordinary and allowable methods and means. And then there was no doubt,

   Secondly. A sinful cherishing of sensitive appetite, which it belongs
   to a reasonable creature to have governed, and kept with in limits. He
   was of a compound nature; intellectual, and sensible; and the sensitive
   nature is permitted to aspire and set up for the government, and it is
   yielded. A great violation of the law of his nature, and that order
   that God had settled, at first, of superiority and inferiority between
   his natural powers. The object, no doubt, was very tempting, fair to
   the eye, and it is likely might carry a fragrancy and odoriferousness
   with it to the smell; and, in conjunction with the other methods of
   temptation, this might signify much. But, in the mean time, the
   cherishing and indulging sensitive appetite against the law of the mind
   and rational nature, could not but be a very faulty commission in this
   respect.

   And so, altogether comes to discover the difference between paradise
   and heaven, the paradisiacal state and the heavenly state. There was at
   first, in paradise, sinlessness; thus far, there was a posse non
   peccare, a possibility of not sinning: but in the heavenly state a non
   posse peccare, an impossibility of sinning. This difference was soon to
   be understood; that is, it is now to be collected from what did soon
   and early appear in view. Man was not made in a state of comprehensor,
   in that which was to be his ultimate and consummate state; but in a
   state of probation, made a probationer, in order to some further state,
   which upon his approving himself he was to be introduced into. And such
   a defectibility, a possibility of understanding things wrong, and
   choosing wrong, it was most suitable to the primitive state of man.
   According to all that we can apprehend of the wisdom of God, there must
   be a state of probation, before a state of retribution; before
   punishment or reward, there must be an obediential state, wherein a man
   shall, as he acquits himself, be capable of, or liable to, the one or
   to the other. Nothing could be more congruous unto the perfection of
   that Supreme Being who was the Author of our being, than, that this
   should be the state of things between him and man, at the first.

   And now, before we pass from this head, there are sundry instructive
   corollaries or inferences, that we may take up from it.

   1. One we have mentioned already, (as it the last time came in our
   way), that is, of what concernment it is to the female sex to take heed
   of comporting duly with, or lest they should violate or pervert the
   intent of, their being made what they are: and that they, coming into
   the conjugal estate, should be helpers to them with whom they are
   conjoined in that state. "Let us make for man a help meet for him:" we
   see how the design of that very institution was perverted and lost at
   first. A help! such a help as helped to destroy him, and ruin the world
   with him. It was not he that was deceived; (as the apostle to Timothy
   notes;) that is, not first deceived, but she, a woman that God had
   given him. And it is not without apparent need, but most agreeable to
   the ducture of Scripture in this case, that such a remark as this
   should be made; and that they whom it concerns, should receive
   instruction by it: for history is full of many dreadful instances, what
   tragedies, feminine subtilties, and pride, and lust, and envy, and
   vindictiveness, hath brought about in this wretched world. But,

   2. We may further learn from the whole, that it is of equal concern to
   that sex to which God hath given the priority, that they keep up to the
   law of their state; which is to be leaders and guiders in the state of
   marriage when they come thereinto; and that they dwell with the other
   relative, according to knowledge; (as the apostle Peter's expression
   is, 1 Pet. iii. 7.) that they comport with the obligation that the
   original institution hath laid upon them as to this. For we are not to
   think that Adam could, therefore, be excused because Eve solicited him,
   having of fended first: no more than afterwards, Ahab was excused for
   being a wicked man above all others, (upon the matter there was none
   like him for wickedness,) because that Jezebel his wife stirred him up,
   as it is, 1 Kings xxi. 25. He was not, therefore, a more innocent
   person; no, he was wicked, even beyond parallel, though Jezebel his
   wife stirred him up: for Adam ought to have done the business of his
   station. He that is first in such a relation and that hath the higher
   dignity, ought to comport with the obligation of the law of his state,
   and to exercise that more confirmed judgment which is supposed did
   belong to him. That he did not so, this made him guilty before the
   Supreme Judge. "Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife:"
   (Gen. iii. 17.) therefore, the malediction of the doom comes upon him,
   which hath been so generally transmitted as we know. Again,

   3. We learn, hence, that the grace of God, not as it is eminent in
   himself, but as it is transient, doth issue forth, and is communicated
   and imparted here and there, doth admit of degrees: there may be more,
   or there may be less, given forth, according to the mere pleasure of
   the Free-giver. A contemplation that tends highly and justly to exalt
   and magnify the grace of God, and the God of all grace, in the
   absoluteness of that liberty which maketh it what it is, that is,
   "grace. "It could not be grace if it were not most free. And being so,
   then he might dispense more, or he might dispense less, as to him
   seemeth good. We are not to think there was nothing of grace, nothing
   of dignation, nothing of vouchsafement, in God's first treatment of
   Adam: that he would make him such a creature, that he would give him
   such endowments as he did, it was all of good pleasure. But so absolute
   liberty, as doth belong to grace, might issue forth in higher or in
   lower degrees, as should seem meet to the Free-giver: he might give so
   much of his own influence, as by which it was intrinsically possible
   (as was said before) not to have sinned; while he was under no
   obligation to give forth so much as to make it impossible to sin.
   Again,

   4. We may further learn, hence, that by the same steps and degrees by
   which man did at first depart from God, God did depart from man;
   forsook not, but being forsaken: so that the measure which he gave long
   after, was at first observed strictly; (as it still is every where in
   the world;) God is with you while you are with him: so it ever was, so
   it ever will be, between him and his intelligent creatures. As the
   creature goes off from him, he righteously recedes and goes from the
   creature. Not, that on the part of favour he puts himself under any
   negative tie, that is not to be thought or imagined, but he is pleased
   to put himself under a positive one; that is, he hath put himself under
   no obligation to do more than according to this rule. For that he most
   frequently doth: and (in the state of apostasy) without it, who could
   be saved? None could, if God did not draw nigh to men; or took up a
   thought so to do. That rule is no negative tie upon God: but he hath
   been pleased to put himself under a positive tie; that is, such as are
   in the state of grace now, God will be with them while they are with
   him. As to Adam, who was in a state of grace of another kind at first,
   God would most certainly be with him as long as he was with God. And so
   it is still, with any that are in a state of grace, any that God takes
   to be his peculiar people: "I will be with you while you are with me;"
   he will never do less than that. He may, many times, do more,
   incomparably more, unspeakably more: he may prevent, and be beforehand;
   or he may follow men in their wanderings, even as he did Adam himself
   when he was wandered and gone off. But he would never go off from Adam
   first; he only did go off and depart from him by such steps as by which
   Adam did depart from God: and not being tied to the contrary, he might
   do so, and for wise and holy ends did. But again,

   5. We may further learn, hence, that such a liberty of will as stands
   in a mere indifferency to good or evil, is no perfection unalterably
   and immutably belonging to the nature of man: nothing can be more
   apparent, such a liberty as that, is most unfit to be magnified and
   made such an idol of as it hath, by many within the Christian world.
   For it is plain, and nothing can be plainer, that it did not belong as
   a perfection, immutably, to the nature of man. It was very suitable to
   that less perfect state in which man was created and made. But it is
   not to be found agreeing to it immutably, and without variation, at any
   time since, or ever will again. It just served for that state wherein
   he was at first made, such a liberty as stood with an indifferency to
   good and evil, (whether that good or evil should lie in doing or not
   doing, or whether it should lie in doing this or doing that,) it never
   belonged to man, but only in that first juncture, as being very
   suitable to the state in which man, as a probationer, was made and set
   at first. But it is not found to be with man ever since, or is ever
   like to be again: for in the unregenerate state, there is a liberty
   only unto evil, so as "all the imaginations of men's hearts are only
   evil, and that continually." There is no liberty as to any spiritual
   good, saving good. And again, even the regenerate state, though there
   be a liberty to good through grace, yet it is very imperfect. And then,
   look to the consummate state of saints in glory, and there is only
   liberty to good; no liberty of sinning: nay, no liberty to good or
   evil, (consider the matter morally,) not at all. So that so magnified
   an idol of liberty of will, as if it were an inseparable perfection of
   the nature of man, was never known to agree to it; but in its first
   state: and no more was ever found belonging to it since, nor ever will
   be.

   It may be said, it is only the moral good and evil, which is superadded
   to the nature of man, that alters the case with him; and that doth not
   change his nature; but that his nature will still be the same. And it
   is very true, his nature is the same that at first it was; otherwise,
   he could not be the same creature that did offend, and comes to be
   punished; or that shall, by grace, be made to comply with the terms of
   God's gracious covenant; and that shall afterwards come to be, through
   grace, rewarded. He would not be the same creature, if there were a
   change, quite, of his nature, and the essentials of his being: man
   would not be man, he would be another thing. But then, as moral good
   superadded hereunto, the one or the other of them may be without making
   his nature another thing. It can not, therefore, be said, that this
   liberty of will is altogether in separable from his nature. And if, in
   the heavenly state, (which is most plain and evident,) confirmation in
   good, doth nothing spoil a man's liberty, then, the efficacy of his
   grace in his present state, doth not spoil a man's liberty neither:
   nay, it doth much less; for if it should be supposed to do so, then, a
   man would be less a man for being a glorified man; it would be a
   diminution to the dignity of man, and he would be the worse for going
   to heaven; because there, his liberty ceaseth, a liberty to good or
   evil. What an unimaginable thing is that, that it should be a
   depression, a diminution, to a man, to glorify him! that that should be
   a maim of his nature! But if the glory of heaven do not diminish a man,
   or be a maim to him, because it takes away the possibility of sinning
   in the heavenly state; then, the efficacy of grace, in the present
   state, is no diminution, nor blemish, nor maim to the nature of man now
   neither. Again,

   6. We may further learn, hence, what cause we have to apprehend and
   dread the destructive designs of the devil. For what! do we apprehend
   that he is less an enemy to God, or less an enemy to man, now, than he
   was at first? Do you think the devil is grown kinder, more good
   natured, less intent upon the destruction of souls, and less malicious
   against heaven? It is a most intolerable, most inexcusable thing, that
   we who pretend to believe the Revelation of God about these things, and
   do hereby know the devil to have been a "murderer from the beginning,"
   and may collect, that he is still going about, that he may destroy and
   devour as a roaring lion; I say, the Lord have mercy upon us, that
   notwithstanding we pretend to know and believe all this, we should Jive
   so secure as we do, without any thought of any such thing. And,

   7. It may give us to understand the madness of self-confidence, that we
   should be so little afraid of sin; that we should be so little afraid
   of temptation; that we should be so apt to trust our own strength: and
   when that perfect state wherein Adam was made in paradise, was not
   enough to secure him, that we should live such independent lives, so
   seldom look up, that we have not the sense of that petition more deeply
   wrought into our souls, "that we may not be led into temptation."
   Divers other things there are that might be hinted, but I shall only
   add this, for the present,

   8. We may further learn, that there is no need that there should be any
   new invented account of the first apostasy of man, so as therein to
   depart from the plainness and simplicity of the letter of that history,
   which God hath given us of it; there is no need of any such thing. The
   matter, as Scripture represents it, and as we have (though less
   perfectly) represented it from Scripture, as it lies, is rational and
   congruous enough; and such as we need not be ashamed to own and avow to
   the world. There are those that are so over-officious in these matters,
   as to trouble the world with their fine notions and accounts thereof,
   altogether alien from the letter of the history, that so they may (as
   is pretended) make things look a little more plausibly than the letter
   of history doth represent them; when indeed, if the matter be searched
   into, the design seems to be, not to make them look plausible, but
   ridiculous: and their business is not to expound Scripture, but to
   expose it, and the whole of our religion. But I shall say no more to
   them now neither.

LECTURE XXIII. [38]

   So far we have gone in our course of treating, in some order, of the
   several heads of religion, as to enter upon this doctrine of the
   apostasy, which we proposed to consider and speak to from this text,
   Sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and therein to treat of
   these three general heads.

   I. Of the fall of the first man.

   II. Of the fallen state of man. And,

   III. Of the consecution of the latter of these upon the former.

   And for the First of these generals, the Fall of the First Man, we
   proposed, therein, to consider and speak to these four more special
   heads: 1. the sin by which he fell; 2. the way how he fell into, and by
   this sin; 3. the death that did ensue; and, 4. the dueness of that
   death upon this sin: and we have spoken to the two first of these.

   3. We come now to the third, the death that did ensue as to this first
   man. And here the inquiry may be, whether that the death contained in
   the commination or threatening, be principally meant, or the death that
   is in other terms expressed in the consequent sentence? The first of
   these, you read Gen. ii. 17. and the latter you read, Gen. iii. from
   the 17. to the 19. ver. I say, whether the death expressed in the
   commination--"In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
   die:" or that which is in other words expressed (not by the word death)
   in the sentence, "dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return." be
   the same, yea or no; it is plain, that there is a real difference
   betwixt the commination (formally considered) that contains the one,
   and the sentence that expresses the other.

   By the former, the commination or threatening, is established (as far
   as the comminatory sanction could go) that law, or covenant of works,
   which was to concern all mankind. By the latter, to wit, the sentence,
   there was a particular application of this law, now transgressed, unto
   this particular case of transgressing Adam; as that is the proper
   business of a sentence, to apply the law according to which it must be
   understood to pass to the particular case of offenders, when they come
   to be judged by that law.

   But it is here more distinctly to be considered, whether that the
   sentence do not carry with it some moderation as to the evil or penalty
   contained in the threatening of commination: in reference whereto,
   these particulars are worthy your consideration.

   (1.) That the terms, wherein the one and the other are to be delivered,
   are not the same; for the terms of the commination, by which the law or
   covenant of works, that was to concern all mankind is established, as
   by a solemn sanction, goes in these express terms: "In case thou
   eatest, thou shalt (as we read it) surely die:" thou shalt die the
   death, or, dying, thou shalt die. But the sentence hath not the word
   "death" in it; but it speaks of sundry miseries that should attend this
   life, and that should end, at length, in the dissolution of the
   compound, and especially, of the earthly part: "Dust thou art, and unto
   dust shalt thou return." Having worn out a sad life amidst many sorrows
   here on earth, thou shalt go to the dust at last, as thou art dust.
   And,

   (2.) It is to be considered, that these different terms are not apt,
   fully, to express the same thing: for whereas, it is said in the
   commination, "In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the
   death," these are expressions very fitly accommodated to signify death
   in the utmost extent, in all the latitude of it, "thou shalt die the
   death:" all the fulness of death seems to be comprised therein without
   limitation. But in the sentence, when the great day comes to pass
   judgment upon the delinquents, (the law being now violated and broken,)
   you have not, in his application to either of the human offenders, any
   so terrible expressions as this, only they are doomed to manifest
   sorrows and miseries: and it is told to Adam, (in whom the woman must
   be comprehended as being taken out of the man) that "dust they are, and
   unto dust they shall return;" therefore, there seems to be much less in
   the sentence than in the commination. And,

   (3.) It is to be considered, that between these two, the gospel did
   intervene; that is, between the commination and the sentence: the
   commination was given with the law to man yet innocent: when he was now
   fallen and had transgressed, then cometh the sentence; but it so comes
   as that the gospel steps in between, being tacitly insinuated in
   reference to them, in what was directly said to the serpent; that which
   was a curse to him, was a blessing to them: "I will put enmity between
   seed and seed, between thy seed and the woman's seed; and that seed
   shall break thy head, though thou shalt bruise his heel." And this, the
   grace of God might, for ought we know, apply and bring home to the case
   of Adam, as it was applied to all the more special seed of the woman,
   that should come to be united with him who was most eminently the
   woman's seed. And therefore, it might very well be, that though all the
   fulness and horrors of death, taken in its utmost latitude and
   comprehension, were included in the commination, there might, in
   pronouncing the sentence upon Adam, be as great a mitigation, as the
   variation of the terms doth import.

   But our inquiry here, must be concerning the death contained in the
   commination, where we have the term of "death," double death, or dying
   the death, most expressly made use of. And it is by that, that the
   dying of this death is to be measured; to wit, by the commination, as
   it did concern Adam, and it must concern Adam's posterity. And admit,
   that there was a real mitigation upon the intervening of the gospel,
   and the exercise of the grace of God, applying it in Adam's case, yet
   we are still to consider the death that was contained in the
   commination, as due to Adam; due, to wit, in a former instance, before
   there could be a mitigation in a latter, in a following instance: for
   supposing there were then so quick and speedy a remission in so great
   part, yet, the penalty remitted must be due, before it could be
   remitted. It must be a debt, before it could be a remitted debt. And so
   concerning the death that was due, which offending Adam and his
   posterity became subject and liable to; I say, concerning that, it is,
   we have to in quire, as this dueness is measured by the commination;
   though indeed, we are not yet, according to the series and order of
   discourse, to consider this death in the extensiveness of it to Adam's
   posterity; for that comes in, under the next general head, the fallen
   state of man; whereas, we have only now to consider the fall of the
   first man, and what did concern the case of Adam himself. And so, our
   inquiry is, What death it was that was threatened to him, upon the
   supposition that he should transgress? And of this matter, I shall give
   you an account in several particulars.

   [1.] Most plain it is, that corporeal death was included in the meaning
   of the commination; for that he did actually incur. You read, in the
   short history that we have of him, that death, at length, finished his
   course. He lived so long, and he died. And it could not be, that he
   should incur that which was not due. And if it were due, it must be so
   upon the commination; as the dueness of any such punishment, upon any
   delinquent, is first measured by the law; the sentence is to proceed
   according to law; that is, so far as not to go beyond it: it is
   possible there may be mitigations, but the extent of the law cannot be
   exceeded. That is therefore plain, that corporeal death was included.
   And,

   [2.] It is very evident too, that much more was included than corporeal
   death: for Adam did actually surfer more (as is manifest) than mere
   corporeal death; as the labours, and hard ships, and sorrows of life,
   and whatsoever else besides, about which we shall further inquire anon.
   And,

   [3.] That more beyond corporeal death could not mean annihilation, or
   an extinction of his being. For,

   First. We do not find that either he, or any one else, was ever
   annihilated, or that any creature ever was. No such thing appears that
   either he, or any man, or any thing, was actually reduced to nothing.
   Nor again,

   Secondly. Could death be a proper expression of annihilation: for
   annihilation is not adequately opposite to life. There is no adequate
   opposition between life and annihilation: if there were, then life and
   non-annihilation, or continuing such a thing in being, must be
   equivalent terms, if the other be adequately opposite terms. But it is
   plain, they are not so; because it is manifest, there are many things
   in being, and which are some what, and yet do not live. Therefore, to
   suppose that annihilation should be the thing meant by death, here, as
   is threatened to Adam, and so to offending man in him, is a dream
   without a pretence or ground, neither to be found, or any shadows of
   it, in Scripture; nor at all agreeing to the reason of the thing.

   To reduce a thing to nothing, is no apt kind of punishment. There is no
   other thing, indeed, but a reasonable creature, that is capable of
   punishment, properly so called. But the reduction of any thing to
   nothing, is to put it absolutely out of any capacity of apprehending
   itself under divine displeasure; or, that it is self-fallen, under the
   animadversion of justice: and therefore, is a most unsuitable thing to
   be designed for the punishment of a reasonable creature, if it were to
   be called a creature. But the very notion is most unsuitable to it. And
   therefore,

   [4.] There is no doubt, but spiritual death is included. "Thou shalt
   surely die," thou shalt die the death: here must be included spiritual
   death; the death of the soul; not naturally understood, but morally:
   for naturally, the soul is immortal, and can never die. But death, in
   reference to the soul, being taken morally, that is, as inclusive both
   of sin and misery, so the soul was liable to death, and became no doubt
   the subject of it, in this very case, antecedently to the restitution,
   and recovery, and the actual supervention of the divine grace. And when
   we say that death, in this sense, that is, the moral sense, doth
   include both sin and misery, it must do so, even by the same reason, by
   which life, in the moral sense, doth include both sanctity and
   felicity. And it is manifest, it doth include both.

   But then, we must further know, that sin being included in this death,
   it must be in a twofold notion, which we must understand in our minds
   concerning sin; that is, sin is to be considered, either as it is an
   evil against God; or it is to be considered, also, as an evil to
   ourselves. As an evil against God, so it could be a wrong to him,
   though it cannot be a hurt. And in that sense, or according to that
   notion, we are not to take sin here, for so we considered it under the
   former head. Very true it is, we must add,

   [5.] That there is a necessary complication of sin and misery with one
   another, as there is of sanctity and felicity with one another: they
   are complicated, and cannot but be so, even in their own natures. But
   though they cannot be severed, they may be considered distinctly.
   Severed they cannot be, neither of these two pairs--neither sin and
   misery, nor holiness and blessedness. Neither of the pairs can be
   disjoined or severed; the love of God, that comprehends in it all our
   duty, and all our felicity, virtually, as being the great active
   principle, and the great fruitive; that principle, from whence I am to
   do all the good I do; and that principle by which I am to enjoy all the
   good that I enjoy, or am capable of enjoying. Both of these two things,
   summed up together in one virtual principle of love, can never be
   disjoined or severed, any more than a thing can be torn and severed
   from itself. And so the case is, as to the opposite pair; sin and
   misery, they can never be disjoined or severed, for they are virtually
   comprehended in one and the same principle; to wit, enmity to God; upon
   the account whereof, while it prevails, it is impossible either to obey
   God or enjoy him. These two, therefore, cannot but he inseparable. But
   while they are inseparable, yet they are distinct too. As to this
   latter pair, wherein, we are now concerned, to wit, sin and misery; "To
   be carnally minded is death." And as it is misery, and so a hurt and
   ruin to us, so it is to be considered here as it comes under the notion
   of the threatened death, and so doth make a part of the threatened
   penalty; that is, sin carrying a self punitive malignancy in it. God
   having been once offended, he leaves the sinner (till grace doth work
   the reparation) under that self-punishment. "Thine own wickedness shall
   correct thee." And so, in this sense it is, that spiritual death must
   be comprehended in that death contained in the commination: "In the day
   thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death." It must comprehend
   spiritual death: and that spiritual death doth also comprehend in it
   several things, of which I shall give you a very brief account. As,

   First. The retraction of God's Spirit. That it contains, as the first
   and most fundamental thing, in this threatened spiritual death, the
   retraction of God's Spirit. When Adam had abused, or not duly used, the
   power which his Creator gave him, of obeying and complying with the
   divine pleasure, the Spirit retired; and now, we must consider the
   difference (as hath been intimated before) between the spiritual
   influence which was vouchsafed to Adam, while he yet remained innocent,
   and that which is afforded to the regenerate, in their present state,
   to preserve that state; that is, as to Adam in innocence, that
   influence was enabling, but not determining. It was such as by which
   (as hath been told you) he had a possibility of not falling, but not an
   impossibility of falling; he had a possibility of standing, not an
   impossibility not to stand; that he had not, that influence of the
   Spirit which he had, being suitable to his state of probation wherein
   he was made, that is now justly withheld, the Spirit retires, leaves
   him to himself.

   This we do not say gratis dictum; for do but consider that plain text:
   (Gal. iii. 13.) "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
   being made a curse for us: for cursed is every one that hangeth on a
   tree: that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us Gentiles, the
   promise of the Spirit, (or the promised Spirit) through faith." If the
   remission of the curse do carry with it the conferring of the grace of
   the Spirit, then the curse, while it did continue, could not but
   include, carry in it, the privation and suspension of the Spirit. This
   was part of the curse upon apostate Adam, the loss of God's Spirit. For
   that which the grace of Christ and redemption by him, removing,
   inferred the communication of the Spirit, that must include the
   suspension and withholding of the Spirit. And,

   Secondly. Hereupon, it could not but ensue, (which is a further thing
   contained in this spiritual death,) that the holy image of God must he
   erased, vanished; and, antecedently to the restitution, it could not
   but be so. And,

   Thirdly. There must be included in this spiritual death, an aversion
   from God, the turning off of the apostate soul from God: that whereas
   it minded him before, with a complacential ado ration, now it is quite
   alienated: here is no inclination in him towards God. The thing speaks
   itself; and it was apparent in Adam's case. As soon as he becomes
   guilty, he hides himself, vainly attempts to hide himself from the
   doom. That which was before the most grateful thing of all things, to
   have God nigh him, is now quite otherwise; he cannot endure that God
   should approach him. If it were possible to keep himself from God, (but
   that he vainly attempts,) his sense would be, "Let me have no more to
   do with God." And,

   Fourthly. There must be further contained in it, hereupon, a cessation
   of that intercourse and communion that was between God and him. For the
   Spirit of God was retired on his part, and man was become averse and
   disaffected to God on his own part. The image of God, that rendered him
   propense towards God, and meet for his communion, being vanished and
   gone, nothing can ensue more necessarily and certainly than a cessation
   of communion: God refuseth to converse with him, and he refuseth to
   converse with God. And,

   Fifthly. There could not also but be included as consequent hereupon,
   regrets of conscience: not penitential but tormenting; not penitential
   as yet, or not penitential first; but first tormenting, before they
   could be penitential, while grace was not yet applied. How soon it
   might be we know not. It is very likely it might be very soon, by the
   account that short history gives us. But in the mean time, there could
   be only tormenting regrets of conscience: "Very lately I was an
   innocent creature; now I am a fallen creature: I then stood right in
   the acceptance and favour of God; now there is war between him and me."
   Penitential regrets, indeed, could not be a part of the penalty; they
   are a part and degree of the sinner's restoration and recovery: but the
   preceding tormenting regrets, they are included in the death. It is a
   deadly thing to be stung with the sense of one's having offended him
   whom we can never propitiate to ourselves again. And hereupon, also,

   Sixthly. Very black and gloomy thoughts must ensue; amazing thoughts!
   He that was in the eye of the innocent, unoffending soul, his highest
   delight, now he is all inwrapt in a cloud; or the mind is inwrapt in a
   cloud that it cannot behold him; such a cloud as it can by no means
   penetrate. God could be conceived of under no other notion than that of
   an enemy and avenger. And,

   Seventhly. There must be, hereupon, most astonishing fears; for it is
   obvious that a reasonable, intelligent mind would consider, "He who did
   so lately fetch me and all this creation out of nothing, is almighty,
   and it is impossible for me to fence against his power. That power that
   could create a world so easily, what can I do to protect myself against
   it, when it is set on work by just displeasure?" And then,

   Eighthly. It must include despair: for the first covenant gave no hope
   of forgiveness, and therefore, gave no room or place for repentance
   till grace came, till an inspired gospel came to be actually applied
   and brought home in this case. And therefore, there must he the epitome
   and sum of hell, in the state of this case; God offended and never to
   be reconciled, and against whose displeasure, armed with power, I can
   have no defence, no protection. All this more, all this surplusage,
   must be contained in this death; that is, spiritual death, the present
   death of the soul in the moral sense, in all this latitude and
   extensiveness of it. And then, further,

   [6.] There is in this surplusage, too, these many external miseries of
   life that we find to be contained, also, in the very sentence: for
   though the sentence may contain less than the commination, yet it could
   not contain more. Therefore, all these being found in the sentence,
   must be in the commination too: all the external miseries of life that
   a delinquent creature could be liable to. And then, in the last place,

   [7.] This death must carry in it, too, death eternal, as the sum of the
   penalty, or the consummation thereof, as the evil threatened and
   contained in that. And though many would speak very distinguishingly of
   this matter, and labour to do so when they can, yet let but plain
   Scripture be considered in the case, and you will see how it speaks. Do
   but follow this very context unto the shutting up of this chapter, and
   you will see what kind of reign it is that sin hath in the world. It
   now began its reign, even in this first apostasy, or in the apostasy of
   the first man. Sin, we are told, it reigns unto death, verse 21. "As
   sin hath reigned unto death, so grace might reign through righteousness
   unto life." What life? "Unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our
   Lord." You see how these two stand in their antithesis, in their
   opposition to one another. Here is death set in opposition to eternal
   life. What death is that that stands in opposition to eternal life?
   Surely, it must he eternal death. So in the conclusion of the next
   chapter: "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
   life, through Jesus Christ our Lord." "The wages of sin is death." It
   is not said of this or that sin, some greater sin; but, "The wages of
   sin," as sin, "is death." And what death, the opposition shews us: it
   is put in opposition to eternal life; therefore, it must be eternal
   death that is the wages of sin, of sin as sin: and therefore, if Adam's
   transgression was sin, such a death must be the wages of it.

   And that is the third particular, belonging to this first general head,
   that we were to treat of, to wit, to shew what the death was that did
   ensue, and was designed to ensue, by force of the divine law; or the
   commination added thereto, upon this first sin of the first man. Now,

   4. The fourth of these heads is the dueness of this death upon this
   sin; and upon that I shall not insist, it being enough to touch it,
   things being obvious of themselves. The heinousness of the sin, and the
   too naturalness of the punishment taken together, will evince the
   dueness of this event upon this sin.

   (1.) Consider the heinousness of the sin. We have opened that unto you
   in many particulars formerly, to which I shall only add the
   consideration of these four circumstances. As that,

   [1.] The first man should so soon transgress. But just now made; (upon
   the matter it being generally thought to be but a little time: most
   think the same day 3) just now made by God, a reasonable, immortal
   creature, and so soon made by himself, a sinner, transgressor, and a
   rebel.

   [2.] Consider that he sinned with open eyes, having, before, no cloud
   upon his mind, but all things in clear light before him,

   [3.] And while his nature was antecedently untainted, no vicious
   inclination in him. And,

   [4.] That there was nothing which could be matter of complaint in his
   state, his condition so entirely good, and yet did not please him.
   Think, I say, of the heinousness of the sin, in these and other
   respects, and then the incurred death cannot be thought
   unproportionable, or undue, though you take it in the extent that hath
   been mentioned. But,

   (2.) Consider, too, the con-naturalness of the punishment to the sin,
   this death to his transgression. He turns from God to the creature: God
   turns away (in just displeasure, upon being offended,) from him. Hence,
   all these things ensue and follow of themselves. And there was no
   preventing it by any ordinary methods, unless God would annihilate him,
   unless lie would throw his creature hack again into nothing. But that
   became not the wisdom and greatness of God to do. It had been too much
   trifling to raise his creature into being, and put him under such an
   equitable, and so righteous a law, and., he offending, presently to
   nullify his own work. That had not been becoming God, not suitable to
   the divine wisdom and greatness.

   And therefore, now to give some brief notes of Use upon the two last
   mentioned heads.

   1. You may learn, hence, that the act of eating the for bidden fruit,
   is not to be considered too abstractly, as the first sin of man; that
   is the thing wherein the most do foolishly impose upon themselves, and
   so speak and think diminishingly of this whole matter. What! was it so
   great a matter? was it so great a thing to eat the fruit of a tree that
   was for bidden? This, abstractly considered, was not the first sin. Not
   abstractly considered; take it comprehensively, and take it in all that
   was belonging to it, and it was the first sin. But the act of eating
   alone, considered by itself, was not the first; there were a great many
   mental evils (as we have shewn in opening the sin) which did precede
   the act of eating, and that altogether, make it a most horrid
   wickedness; distrust of the truth of God's word, and trusting a
   creature that he might easily apprehend to be an apostate, fallen
   creature, by opposing the word of God; trusting him against him that
   made him, and gave him breath. He trusted against God, one, he knew not
   whom: but he might suppose it one that was not in his original
   integrity, that was fallen and gone off from God; otherwise he could
   never have counselled against God. There was great ingratitude for
   goodness, shewn and exhibited; for mercy received: mercy, indeed, as
   yet it could not properly be called, he not being as yet a miserable
   creature, or in a miserable state. There was opposing his will to the
   Supreme Will, There was exalting the sensitive nature against the
   rational, against the law of the mind; and so confounding the order of
   things, in that part of God's creation; to wit, himself breaking the
   order and dependance of the faculties in reference to one another, with
   many more.

   2. And you may further learn, hence, how nearly sin and misery, sin and
   death, do border upon one another. They are things very near to each
   other. These two spheres of life and death; that lightsome, glorious
   sphere, all full of vitality, pleasure and bliss; and that sphere of
   darkness and death, that comprehended every thing of horror in it, you
   see how nearly they do touch, and how nearly they did touch; so that we
   might suppose, but even a moment between the one and the other. This
   moment, an innocent creature, standing in delight, and favour, and
   acceptance; and the next moment, an accomplice of hell, associated with
   apostate spirits against God. How nearly do the spheres of light, and
   life, and bliss; and of death, and horror, and hell, touch! How near
   did they touch one another! How immediate was the transitus, the
   passage from the one to the other! And,

   3. You see, not only the nearness in point of time; but the natural
   connexion that is between sin and misery; that the one doth in so great
   a measure involve the other, as I have shewn they do. Sin carries death
   in it; "To be carnally minded is death." And we may further see,

   4. What occasion we should take, hence, to admire the grace of the
   gospel, that it should so soon intervene; and when it so doth, here is
   place for repentance by the constitution of a new covenant, the
   evangelical one, which the covenant and law of works could not give
   upon any terms: for it could represent God no otherwise than as an
   unappeasable enemy. "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
   things that are written in the book of the law to do them."

LECTURE XXIV. [39]

   Rom. v. 12.

   And so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.

   FROM the former part of this scripture, we have insisted upon the fall
   of the first man; "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
   sin;" his fall, by sin, into death. And so you have seen the entrance
   of both these, sin and death, into the world, in the fall of that one
   man. Now we come in the next place;

   II. To speak, from the latter words, of the fallen state of man,
   generally considered. And you see the ground of that, too, lies as
   fully in the latter words of the text, that "death passed upon all men,
   for that all have sinned." I read the words according to our
   translation, though some would have them to be otherwise read, and the
   letter of the text doth admit of another reading: instead of "for
   that," they read "in whom," all have sinned. But of that there will be
   more occasion to speak hereafter.

   In the mean while we are to consider the fallen state of men in
   general, according as these expressions do represent and hold forth to
   us. And they do represent his state to be a state of sin and death;
   these two complicated with one another. "Death hath passed upon all,
   for that all have sinned." And, according to that reading of the words,
   and the nature of the thing, that which is here last mentioned.,
   requires to be considered first, though these are complicated with one
   another; sin and death run into one another, are most inseparably
   conjunct; yet, they are all some way distinct. And so far as they do
   admit of being distinguished, we shall consider and speak to them
   distinctly. And so,

   1. Of the sinful stale of men in general. Now, in speaking to this, as
   the letter of the text leads us, we shall--consider the nature,
   and--the universality, chiefly, of this sin that is thus spread through
   the world. We are,

   ( 1.) To consider the nature of it. The general nature of sin is
   plainly expressed 1 John iii. 4. "Sin is the transgression of the law."
   And therefore, that we may shew you more distinctly the nature of that
   sin which hath so generally diffused itself among men, (as we shall
   afterwards shew,) it will be needful to inquire, What it is that we
   must take for the mea sure of such sin? inasmuch as the following words
   here do plainly tell us, in the latter part of the 13th verse, that
   "sin is not imputed where there is no law:" wherever any sin is, some
   law must be supposed to be. And what is that law, against which it can
   be understood that men might so gene rally sin?

   You have heard, by what law the first sin of man was to be measured:
   that was partly a positive law, a particular precept, a law made by a
   spiritual revelation to him: but much more principally a natural law,
   which was violated in the violation of that positive one, inasmuch as
   that positive law had its immediate root and foundation in the natural
   one: nothing being more apparently natural, than that the reasonable
   creature ought to comply with the will of his Maker being once known.
   But though it were very apparent what law that first sin did
   transgress, yet it is not so apparent what law it is that the common
   sin of mankind doth now transgress. And so that needs to be inquired
   into.

   In the general, it may be said, that the law that doth obtain in the
   world now, and from age to age, doth consist of two parts, as the law
   at first did which was given to Adam, even in his innocency; to wit,
   that it is partly natural, and partly by superadded Revelation. So it
   was at first, so it is still; but with great and remarkable difference.
   That whereas, at first, the natural law was full, perfect, intire, most
   comprehensive, and large, even in the discernible impressions of it;
   and the superadded law by special Revelation narrow, lying in a very
   little compass (one particular interdict only with its penalty
   establishing it) that we read or are informed of. But now the case is
   very diverse and opposite: that is, the natural is diminished, not in
   the obligation of it, but in the impression, the discernible or
   discerned impression, that frame in the heart or mind of man broken
   into fragments, many parts very obscure and illegible, and divers, with
   many of the inhabitants of this earth, (as it were,) lost through
   inadvertency, and their not reflecting upon themselves so as to discern
   and find out the sculpture of what remains engraven upon their hearts.
   And the revealed law, (where that obtains,) that is so much the more
   large, and comprehensive, and full, and perfect, so as to discover
   every false way; and every true and right way: one and the same rule
   being the same measure, recti et obliqui, of that which is right and
   that which is wrong too.

   And the exigency of the case did require that it should be so: that is,
   by how much the more that the natural law was erased, broken into
   fragments and parcels, and many of them (as to their discernibleness)
   lost with many; so much the more requisite was it, that the superadded
   law (which was to be by revelation) should be entire and complete, that
   there should be another impression of that original law, that should
   collect and gather up all that was lost of it, and rendered it obscure,
   from the prevailing corruption of the world. And so thus, in short, did
   these two cases stand in opposition to one another. At first, the
   natural law was most entire and full and large and comprehensive: and
   the revealed law narrow, and lying within a very little compass. But
   now the natural law, to wit, in the discernibleness of its impression,
   is greatly diminished; and the law that is by revelation so much the
   more large, comprehensive, entire, and full.

   At first, that revealed law after the apostasy, must, for several
   successive ages, be easily transmitted (by reason of the great
   longevity that remained before and after the flood) from hand to hand
   by a certain tradition. But afterwards, God provided that it should be
   collected and gathered up into Sacred Records, though not all written
   at once, but successively, according as supreme wisdom had determined
   concerning the different states in the future church, in point of
   light. And so, what we have of it now, lies entirely and fully in the
   sacred volumes, of which we have discoursed to you largely hereto fore;
   but that doth actually obtain but in a small part of the world in
   comparison: but a very small part. That it doth obtain no further, is
   owing to the wickedness of the world itself, which obstructs the
   diffusion of it. God, in his holy wisdom not obtruding, not by
   extraordinary means and methods making way for it, as it were easy for
   him to do, if it were so agreeable to the counsel of his own wisdom,
   the results whereof we now see, in fact; and the reasons whereof may be
   better understood in the appointed season. But we are not to think this
   wicked world innocent in its having no more of revealed light than it
   hath; that light shines in darkness, but the darkness doth not
   comprehend it, strives against it, otherwise there must have been a
   diffusion, even of most evangelical knowledge many an age ago. Men
   fence against it and keep it off, and will not let it spread; and God
   doth not exert the greatness of his power as yet (for ends and purposes
   best known to himself) for the gaining of a victory over that
   contumacious darkness.

   Yet, in the meantime, where there are no notices of that revealed law,
   or that law by Revelation, we are not to think that the world is
   without law: do but observe to this purpose what follows the text:
   "Until the law (verse 13.) sin was in the world;" until the law. Until
   what law? It is certain, here, "law" must be taken in a restrained and
   limited sense, otherwise the expressions in the following part of that
   verse would contradict those in the former: "Sin is not imputed where
   there is no law:" then there could have been no such thing as sin, from
   Adam to Moses, if there had been no law at all in all that interval.
   When therefore, it is said, "Until the law sin was in the world;" that
   is, Until the written law, or until the law that was given on mount
   Sinai, it is not the Jaw simply, but respectively only, that is there
   meant; not in an absolute and general, but in a particular and limited
   sense.

   It is true, there was a time (that time that is there mentioned, from
   Adam to Moses) when there was no such law as came afterwards to be in
   the time of Moses, Not that there was then no law at all; for then
   there could be no sin; but it is expressly told us, that "sin was in
   the world" for all that time; and therefore, there was some law; there
   was a law by which men might be reckoned sinners: for there was such a
   law according to which they were punished, as the following words shew;
   "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses;" there was such a law
   as made men still liable to death; and therefore, such a law against
   which men might still sin, even in the long interval from Adam to
   Moses. "Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not
   sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."

   I pray consider that expression, "that had not sinned after the
   similitude of Adam's transgression." How was that? That is, that did
   not sin against a particular and express law, with its annexed
   sanction, as Adam did. Some would under stand that of infants; and, it
   is true, it must include them. But I see no cause at all for such a
   restriction; but most manifestly the contrary: for infants were not the
   only ones that did die; death reigned over all, in that interval from
   Adam to Moses; and so, the sin must be as general as the death. But
   herein was the great dissimilitude, that, whereas Adam did sin against
   a framed, express precept, with its annexed penalty in the commination,
   the generality of men from Adam to Moses, did not so sin; but they
   sinned against such a law as they had; that is, the relics and
   fragments of the law of nature, first impressed upon the heart of man,
   or put into his very nature.

   This is agreeable to what we have in this same epistle, chap. ii. 12.
   "As many as have sinned without the law," (that is, without a written
   law,) "shall perish without law;" to wit, without that written law.
   Some law or other they were still under; they must be supposed to sin
   against some law; otherwise they could perish -by none. But a written
   law they had not. "As they that are under the law, (as it there
   follows,) they are to be judged by the law." And afterwards, in the 14.
   and 15. verses of the same chapter: "When the Gentiles who have not the
   law, do by nature the things contained in the law, they are a law unto
   themselves, which shew the works of the law written in their hearts,
   their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts in the mean
   while accusing or else excusing one another" So we read it, and I think
   very defectively, "accusing and excusing:" it is in the greek, "by
   turns;" not "one another;" but, "sometimes accusing, and some times
   excusing." Not as if their thoughts did accuse one another, or excuse
   one another; but the expression may admit to be read, I say, a
   sometimes accusing, and some times excusing," according to the
   discernible evidence of the case.

   And so you may now easily collect, how, in this general sinful state of
   the apostate world, men do every where transgress against a law. Those
   that have a written law, or might more easily have it, they sin against
   that; to wit, the Revelation that God hath given of his own mind
   concerning their duty, and in order to their felicity. They that have
   it, or might more easily have it, I say, sin against it. They that have
   it not, or from whom it lies more remote, they yet, sin against the
   dictates of the law which they have in themselves, or which they are to
   themselves. They that have no other law, being a law to themselves,
   they having some measures, though broken and imperfect ones, of right
   and wrong in their own minds and natural consciences.

   And now, the measure being stated by which this general sinfulness of
   the world is to be estimated, the natural law and, generally, that law
   that is by Revelation in the word of God, so far as it doth obtain, or
   might more easily obtain; it will be our further business, in the next
   place, to open to you the sinfulness of men in reference to this law,
   of which you have this account. And it is, in the general, the
   sinfulness of their inclination, or of their nature, that we are
   obliged, by the design of our present subject, to consider and speak
   to: "For that all have sinned."

   Here is not, it is true, actual sin: that the expression doth literally
   signify. But that must be understood as supposing a sinful nature,
   which is more principally to be considered; or it is to be considered
   in the first place; that which is the peccatum peccans, as it is
   significantly enough called by some. That evil heart, that nature, not
   as it is nature, but as it is depraved, it is now transmitted every
   where from age to age, and from generation to generation, among men:
   the fountain from whence all those streams of wickedness flow that have
   deluged the world, and made a raging ocean, "the waves whereof
   continually cast forth mire and dirt," as the prophet expresseth it.
   Isa. lvii. 20. That nature of man, which as it is degenerate and
   corrupt, is become a seminary, a seed-plot of all kinds of wickedness.

   This is for peccatum originale originatum; as we formerly discoursed to
   you of the peccatum originale originans, as some do choose to express
   those things. It is, in the general, a sinful inclination which lies
   opposite to the law of God, natural or revealed: for we are not to
   suppose that the love of God doth only provide against sinful acts, or
   sinful omissions, no, this is the very peculiar excellency of the
   Divine Government, in contradistinction to any other; that it
   determines first, what men ought to be, and then, consequently and
   dependantly, what they ought to do. Human laws and governments do not
   respect the former of these, otherwise than consequentially. They only
   take notice of actions, and those, external ones too. But internal
   inclinations they make little provision about, and do not otherwise
   take notice of (as indeed the nature of the thing doth not admit they
   should) but by consequence, as a man's habit and internal inclination
   may be collected and gathered from the series and course of his
   actions. But it is quite contrary as to the Divine Government, and the
   laws that be long thereunto; that is, that God having an immediate
   inspection into the minds of men, and his government, laying its first
   obligation there; its laws do first provide what men should be; and
   then consequentially, what they should do. They should be so and so; be
   holy, be righteous; and then, all is to correspond hereunto.

   Therefore, we must understand that an evil inclination, or a depraved
   or corrupted nature, is that which doth first violate the law of God,
   lies first against it: and so, that it is not infelicity only, to be
   ill inclined, but it is sin--sin in the highest and most eminent sense
   thereof. It is the habitual frame and bent of the soul, that the law of
   God doth in the first place direct: and then, it doth direct that men
   should act correspondency thereunto, So that now that empoisoned nature
   of man, the malignity of the heart and soul, or inner man, is that
   which makes the first and principal breach upon the law of God, which
   is in its own nature holy, just, and good: whatsoever there is of this
   law left, it is all holy, just and good, even as it doth obtain to be
   called "the law of nature." What is truly such, is holy, just, and
   good, still, as much as ever it was, and as expressive of the mind of
   God.

   Now concerning that corrupt inclination in the minds and souls of men,
   that doth first violate the law, it is to be under stood agreeably to
   the law itself. The law itself, is partly preceptive, and partly
   prohibitive. It consists of these two parts. And these two things are
   accordingly to be considered in the corrupted state of human nature: to
   wit, first, that there is a disinclination to all that is truly good;
   and, secondly, that there is a propensity, a perverse inclination, to
   all that is sinful and wicked.

   [1.] The first of these, that is, which is signified by the want of
   original righteousness, that rectitude which did first belong to the
   nature of man, the absence, and not the mere absence; but the want and
   privation of that, is the first thing we have to consider in the
   corruption of man's nature; that now it wants the inclination that
   there ought to be in it according to its primitive state, and the first
   obligation of the divine law upon man. This is the loss of God's image;
   not by his taking it away, which we must carefully abstain from
   thinking, even so much as one thought to that purpose; that is, that
   God took away his image from man, to wit, his image in respect whereof,
   man was to resemble him in point of holiness; that would be to devolve
   the sinfulness of man's nature upon God himself. But God did
   righteously, upon the first apostasy, withhold his Spirit, whereupon
   his image, being a created thing, and not capable of self-subsistence,
   must vanish: and so, as that in effect to erase the holy image of God
   out of his soul. He (man) hath expunged and blotted it out; provoked
   the Spirit of God to retire; cherished and indulged corrupt
   inclinations against it, and in opposition to it. And, God finally
   still retiring, that image falleth and vanisheth: not being withdrawn
   by him, (speaking of the effect,) but being expelled; not withdrawn,
   but drawn away; not by violence (as it were) obliterated out of the
   soul. That which was, indeed, God's workmanship at first, is defaced by
   our wicked workmanship: the work of our hands hath so far destroyed the
   work of his.

   There is, therefore, in the corrupt nature of man, a disinclination to
   all that which it ought to be inclined to; that is, both to objects and
   acts, that it ought to be inclined to. We are principally to consider
   the objects; the acts will of course most obviously ensue. The objects
   wherewith man was to have to do, were God himself, his fellow
   creatures, (those especially of his own order,) and himself.

   There was, upon God's having made man, the direct relation first
   between Creator and creature; and then, hereupon, (there being divers
   such of the same order,) there follows, of course, a collateral
   relation between one such creature and another. In the first respect,
   man being a reasonable creature by his nature, a creature and a
   reasonable one, he comes under obligation to God most directly: and
   then, collaterally, (from God still,) he comes to be under obligation
   to his fellow-creatures of his own order: and inasmuch as he is capable
   of bearing a relation to himself, so he comes to owe duty to himself
   also.

   To God in the first place. There is an aversion from God, to be
   considered in this fallen state of man, not of one single faculty of
   the soul alone, but even of the whole soul, and of all the faculties of
   it. But according to the natural order wherein they lie towards one
   another, the whole soul is gone off from God; mind, and will, and
   affections, and executive powers, al together turned off from God. So
   is the account given of the fallen state of man in that xiv. and liii.
   Psalm, from which texts and from others, you have so many quotations
   taken in the 3d. chapter of his epistle to the Romans, all summed in
   this, that "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
   This, then, is the great thing that, in the first place, is held forth
   in this text; to wit, that the state of man is a state of apostasy and
   recess from God; he hath withdrawn himself, and stands now in his whole
   soul in a quite averse posture from God; towards whom he was originally
   and naturally most propense.

   But then, whereas God, the Object of this aversion, is to be considered
   two ways; as our Supreme and Sovereign Lord, and as our Supreme and
   Sovereign Good, the soul of man is averse to him under both these
   notions; refuseth to take him as his Supreme Lord; or. for his Supreme
   Good; that is, it will neither obey him, nor be happy in him. And
   whereas, under this twofold notion, we are to consider God the Object
   of this aversion, it is under the former of these notions that we are
   to consider it now, while we are speaking of the sinful state of man,
   or the sin of man. It will be under the latter of these notions that we
   are to consider it, when we speak of the death that hath passed over
   all men, as that whereunto it doth more peculiarly and properly belong.

   But consider God as the Supreme Lord, and the sinfulness of man's
   nature, in this respect, lies in this, that he is, under this notion,
   averse to, and turned off, from him, and declines obedience to him. And
   the whole is, under this notion, averse; that is, the mind is averse,
   not only doth not know him, but declines knowing him, labours under,
   not a mere nescience of God, but an affected and chosen ignorance,
   desires not to know him. So is the representation made to us of the
   opposite state and condition of man in those mentioned psalms, the 53,
   most fully, 2, 3 verses; that is, "That God looking down from heaven
   upon the children of men to see who would inquire, who would seek after
   God, he finds them all gone back;" (the Hebrew word signifies a
   perverse retrocision, waywardly gone back;) no, here is no inclination
   to inquire after God; according to that, Job xxi. 14. "They say unto
   God, Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways," of thy
   concerns, and of thy methods. Those ways of intercourse that thou
   wouldst have to be between thee and us; these ways of thine we do not
   desire to know; we do not desire there should be any intermeddling, any
   intercourse between thee and us. And according to that Rom. i. 28.
   "They liked not to retain God in their knowledge." They did not only,
   or barely, not know him, but disliked to know, refused to know him.
   "Through deceit they refused to know me," saith the Lord, Jer. ix. 6.
   The same corrupt nature remaining, even under a professed relation to
   him, with the generality of that wicked people.

   And so, in this respect, the state of man is a state of darkness: to
   wit, of affected darkness. "There is no darkness or shadow of death
   where the workers of iniquity can hide themselves." It speaks the
   inclination of men's minds that they would fain hide themselves in some
   darkness or shadow of death if they could; but they can find none, none
   that hides them from him, though they can easily so inwrap themselves
   in darkness, as not to behold him. Their darkness is a fence against
   themselves; but not against him. They make it so thick that they cannot
   penetrate it; but he most easily can. They would fain have such a
   darkness as that he might not see them; but there is none, they cannot
   find any: "There is no darkness or shadow of death where the workers of
   iniquity can hide themselves. "But, in the mean time, that speaks the
   inclinations of their minds: "O! that we could be hid from God, and
   that there might be nothing at all to do between him and us." "Ye were
   darkness," (here is the common state of the unconverted, unregenerate
   world,) Ephes. v. 8. "Ye were darkness," not merely in the dark, but
   darkness itself. "The light that is in them is darkness," as our
   Saviour speaks, Mat. vi. 23. "If the light that is in thee be darkness,
   how great is that darkness." This, I say, speaks an aversion of mind
   from God; they care not to know him; they desire not to know him.

   And hereupon, it becomes so unaccustomed a thing to think of him.
   Thence is the character of a wicked, unregenerate man, "A forgetter of
   God." It is his usual paraphrase in Scripture; "A wicked man," and that
   lies, as such, under doom, is under such a character as this, one that
   is "A forgetter of God:" "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all
   the nations that forget God" Psalm ix. And in opposition hereunto, a
   regenerate man, a holy man, a renewed man, is characterized by one that
   remembers God, that thinks of God: "A book of remembrance was written
   for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name." Whereas, it
   is said of the wicked man; "God is not in all his thoughts." Compare
   these two places together, Psalm x. 4. Mal. iii. 16. A good man is such
   a one as thinks much of the name of God, hath God's name impressed on
   his mind: so as every actual thought of God, it is only reading the
   letters that do (as it were) compose that name, and that are impressed
   on his own mind; to wit, his actual thinking of God. Now a book of
   remembrance was written for them that feared the Lord, and thought of
   his name. As if it had been said; "Well, is there so much kindness
   towards me yet to be found in this revolted world, that they will
   remember me? I will have a book of remembrance for them; there shall be
   remembrance for remembrance. Do they think of me? I will think of them
   too: have they kind thoughts of me? I will have much kinder thoughts of
   them: I will book it up. Every kind thought that is taken up concerning
   me, in this general apostasy and revoltedness of the world from me, I
   will set it down, I will have a book of remembrance for every one that
   has any thoughts of me, in this forlorn state of things."

   And then, as this aversion hath place in the minds of men, it hath so,
   more formally, in their wills: they will not have this Lord to be their
   God; he shall not reign over them; they refuse his empire; throw off
   the reins: "Let us cast away his cords, and break his bands off from
   us." So, in the apostate world, do the princes and people combine
   together against the divine government: and those that lead others
   consent to be led themselves in this case, "Let us break their bands
   asunder, and cast away their cords from us:" (Psalm ii.) those of God,
   and of his Anointed, the Redeemer, the Messiah, as that word signifies.

   And then, likewise, there is a consequent averse or transverse posture
   in the affections of the soul, whereof, indeed, the will is the seat
   and subject; desires, fears, hopes, delights, anger, sorrow, all
   transversed in a quite contrary course and being, to what they should
   be: and so it is proportionably towards men, so far as men are
   concerned with men; and so it is towards ourselves. We should have
   discoursed of these distinctly, but cannot now.

   It is, in the mean time, strange, (and let us consider that with
   ourselves,) that this being so apparently the common case, it should be
   so little considered; that men take such complacency in themselves;
   that it comes so seldom into the thoughts of any to think, "I either
   am, or have been, an apostate creature, quite turned off from God." It
   is to be admired, that men's own thoughts are not painful to them upon
   this account. Certain it is, that I, and the rest of the world, have
   been all in an apostasy from God. This hath been my state; it is my
   present state. I am either an apostate creature, or a returned
   creature: either still apostate, or renewed towards him, altered in my
   habitual frame and inclination. How is it with me? am I one of the
   reduces? one that the mighty hand and power of the Redeemer (he that
   died, "the just for the unjust to bring us to God") hath reduced and
   fetched back to God.

   Or is this the case of none of us? That whereas we were all off from
   God, in an averse posture to him, are we not striving against the
   design of the merciful Redeemer, who is still striving to bring us
   back, and who strove herein unto blood, resisting against the wicked
   inclinations of degenerate, apostate men? "He resisted to blood
   striving against sin." That is the thing plainly implied in that of the
   apostle to the Hebrews, chap. xii. 4. "Ye have not yet resisted unto
   blood, striving against sin;" whereas, he had been, immediately before,
   bespeaking them to "run with patience the race that was set before
   them, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of the faith: who, for
   the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the
   shame." But why did he endure that cross and shame which we find him to
   have despised? The following words shew, he had been striving against
   sin. But that is none of your case: it was his. He suffered that cross,
   and fell under all that opprobium, ignominy and shame, in this striving
   against sin even unto blood; that sin by which men are held off from
   God, continued in a state of apostasy from him.

   Now let us bethink ourselves what the Son of God hath been striving
   unto blood against; to wit, "sin;" which hath turned us off from God,
   and kept us off from God: and are we striving against him, will not be
   reduced, will not be brought back? Strangers to God we have been, and
   so we will be still: go from day to day, from morning to night, and
   will have no concern with God; we will not pray to him; we will not
   think of his name; we will entertain no converse with him.

   But the further Use is referred to be spoken to, after a further
   explication of the sinful state of mankind.

LECTURE XXV. [40]

   It hath been shewed, that the ill inclination of men towards God,
   affects the whole soul. The mind knows him not, thinks not of him, is
   habitually forgetful of him: and, more formally, this aversion is in
   the will: that doth not choose the Lord for his God; wills him not,
   even where a people do profess his name. If yet the work of renovation
   have not taken place, his own Israel will have none of him; "Israel."
   saith God, "would have none of me." Corrupt nature is the same, even in
   such a people, whatsoever the external profession and garb, and
   appearance, and shew, may be. A corrupt heart is still the same thing,
   indisposed, disaffected to God; "alienated from the life of God." And
   conscience is stupified, doth not do its office, or, sometimes, is
   outrageous and overdoes it, the affections and passions are all as so
   many furies; original rectitude being gone, and the soul destitute of
   that holy image which originally it bore.

   But there is, also, an evil inclination towards fellow-creatures of
   their own order. That love is wanting which is "the fulfilling of the
   law;" and that sums up all that rectitude of heart and soul towards
   fellow-creatures of our own order. All is summed up in this; "Thou
   shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;" and therefore, is love the
   fulfilling of the law.

   And then, also, towards ourselves. Our love to our neighbour, is to be
   measured by that to ourselves: as that great fundamental precept which
   our Saviour calls the "second," next to that; "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy might; and thou shalt love
   thy neighbour as thyself;" in opposition whereunto, stands that
   aversion to God, in the first part. And as to the second great
   commandment, it is a measured thing; and the measure is love to
   ourselves.

   But now, in this state of apostasy, men want even that, they do not
   love themselves: to wit, if they did know themselves; and that they do
   not affect, to gain a true knowledge of themselves; and therefore, do
   not love themselves; their more noble self, their more excellent self.
   The soul, which is the man, that they do not love; they care not for
   it; care not how they prostitute it; how they enslave, how they hazard
   it from day to day. Yea, and,

   [2.] In all these respects, there is not only an aversion, an ill
   inclination, to that which is good, a want of original righteousness,
   or of the holy image of God as such; but there is, likewise,
   propensions to all manner of evil; there are violent propensions
   towards forbidden objects. God being forsaken and left, and the soul of
   man being conscious to itself that it is not enough for itself, it must
   adjoin itself to somewhat else, when it is off from God: and so, by the
   same steps by which it recedes from him, it turns to the creature, to
   this vain and impure world, which is God's rival and competitor for the
   minds and hearts of men.

   But here, it is to be considered, that when the soul is off from God,
   and therefore, must seek for somewhat else to supply his room, it finds
   itself under a necessity to make a false and ascititious deity, a
   divided thing, as if it were under a secret consciousness that no one
   thing could fill up the room of God. And therefore, the new deity is
   divided between these two; to wit, between this world and a man's own
   self: that is, his meaner or baser self; his ignoble self. And all of
   you know (if you recollect a little) what God is to be to us, namely,
   our Sovereign Lord, our Sovereign Good: him we are to serve; and him we
   are to enjoy.

   The soul being off from him, and being now to fill up his room as it
   can, it doth (as it can) attempt to fill it up by these two
   things--self and the world: self supplies the room of God, as he is to
   be served by us; and the world supplies the room of God, as God is to
   be enjoyed by us. And here are the propensions, now, of the apostate
   soul, continuing so, and yet unrenewed towards self, as the only one to
   be served, obeyed, and pleased, instead of serving, obeying, and
   pleasing God. And this is one of the greatest idols that is set up in
   the apostate world, even--a man's self.

   But then, remember it is his baser, meaner, and more ignoble self; when
   it is become the vilest thing that it was possible a reasonable,
   immortal soul could become; when it is be sotted, carnalized,
   brutified; when it is, in short, become a brute, when it would be a
   god. While it was itself, it must abhor any such thought, with the
   highest measures and greatest pitch of indignation. But now it is
   brutified into the vilest and most degenerate thing, become even as the
   beasts that perish; now it must be a god. "I will have none to serve
   but this self."

   But then, finding (as that is obvious to every one) that it hath not
   its own good in its own hand, (as, alas! what have I in me to make me
   happier; and though that is more to be considered under the other head
   of death, yet there is sin in it too, as it underwent a direct
   interdict,) it finds it must forage, it must go abroad; it finds it
   hath not enough in itself to satisfy it. And therefore, now in this
   kind, and under this notion, the world is the other idol that is to
   supply the room of God. "Love not the world nor the things of the
   world; for if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
   him." That shews, however, in the unrenewed state, the propensions of
   the soul are, by love, carried towards this vain and wretched world.
   All the good that it designs for itself, it seeks from it. And so,
   these are the two idols that are set up in this apostate world against
   the living and true God: self, as the God that is to be served, and the
   world as the God that is to be enjoyed.

   But then, we must observe, by the way, that as there is towards these
   two substituted objects a violent propension; so it is forbidden, only
   under that notion wherein it is excessive. It is no unlawful thing for
   a man to love himself, and even his meaner self: but to love himself
   with that love wherewith he should love God, that is sinful. It is no
   unlawful thing to love inferior creatures, things of this world, which
   God made all very good; but to love them with that love wherewith we
   should love God, as our supreme and highest Good, herein stands the
   sinfulness of this propension. These are to be in the room of God; not
   to serve ourselves under God, but above him and against him: not to
   enjoy and please ourselves, in this world, in subserviency and
   obedience to God, but in direct opposition.

   And so, there is, upon this account, not only no inclination towards
   God, (which was considered under the former head,) but there is direct
   enmity. Not only, in this case, doth the soul not love him with all the
   heart, mind, and might; but it hates him. And this is the character of
   the apostate world. Look to that Rom. i. 28. "They liked not to retain
   God in their knowledge." And a little lower, they are called
   "God-haters." The word signifies, they hate him with a stygian hatred,
   they hate him as one would hate hell; that is the signification of the
   word "God-haters," which sums up the malignity of this corrupted nature
   of man, that is made out in so many particulars in all that latter part
   of that 1 chapter to the Romans.

   So likewise, in reference to their fellow-creatures, when this love is
   wanting, which they should bear to them, and which is the radical
   principle that comprehends in it all duty of that kind, (that is, doth
   virtually comprehend it all,) the want of that due disposition is
   supplied by a contrary principle, that is, by one contrary thereunto,
   which is that of "being hateful and hating one another," mentioned
   Romans i. 30, 31. and Titus ii. 3. And it is, too, upon this account,
   that "self" is one of the two substituted idols, as you have heard. And
   be cause the interest of this "self" interferes, and there are now as
   many deities to be served, as there are men; hereupon it is, that
   jealousy works into hatred. And it partly proceeds, too, from the
   narrowness and minuteness of this world, which is the other idol that
   men set up in the room and stead of God. This world is too little for
   men; (it cannot but be so;) too little for immortal souls. It is a
   thing in its own nature unsuitable to them; but yet, men being
   deceived, think to have their all out of it: and so they are all
   pulling and tearing one from another, every one for himself, to make
   his own portion out of this world as great and considerable as he can,
   still imagining he shall repair his loss of God, out of this world. And
   all being under the power of this delusion, they do not consider, that
   "there is a lie in their right hand;" that they are seeking that in
   this world which it can never afford them.

   But hereupon, instead of that love which should be "the fulfilling of
   the law" of the second table, spoken of Rom. 13. there is that enmity,
   that mutual hatred of one another, that hath, for so many ages made
   this world an aceldama, a field of blood; and comprehends and sums up
   all those lusts, from whence come wars and fightings among men: among
   men, I say, who Jay under the obligation of so equal a law, and so kind
   a law of love, which so directly tended to the welfare of mankind; and
   so would have made this world a heaven upon earth, every one loving one
   another as himself, and seeking another's good as his own: whereas, all
   make it now their business to tear this world out of one another's
   hands as much as they can, and to pluck it in pieces, and so to worry
   and destroy one another for it.

   And in reference to men themselves too. In the room of a right
   disposition towards themselves, there are substituted, wicked
   propensions: they do affect themselves wickedly, sin fully, illegally,
   against the direction of the divine rule: and this is the root of all
   the insincerity that is to be found, any where in the world, that is,
   that the superior powers do not govern the inferior, do rebel and
   disobey. The mind and judgment that should govern the will, and its
   determinations, and purposes, this way and that, neglect their office;
   so that in the mind, now, is blindness; not generally a not seeing, but
   refusing to see, a willing blindness: that which the Scriptures express
   by "blindness of heart." There is error, self-deception, about the most
   important and most practical matters; the calling of good, evil, and
   evil, good. There is somnolency and drowsy slumber upon the minds of
   men; a supine negligence, that they cannot consider nor care how things
   go within them, or what is uppermost.

   Then again, there is, in the inferior soul, the imaginations, the
   appetites, the affections or passions, a continual mutiny and disorder,
   a rebellion against what doth remain of the law in the mind; so that
   what remains is very imperfect, much obscured, shattered and broken:
   yet, there is a continual mutiny and insurrection against these
   reliques of that law. And this, indeed, constitutes a man, within
   himself, the continual seat of a war; he is in a state of war with
   himself: for he hath some light in his mind; but there are these
   mutinous and rebellious appetitions and passions working in continual
   opposition there unto; so that he cannot rase out those notions, he
   hath in his mind: "This I should do, and that I should do so;" nor will
   his inferior faculties be induced to any kind of compliance therewith.
   It is not such a war as in the regenerate, to wit, in one and the same
   faculty, and especially in the heart and will, where there is an
   imperfect inclination to that which is good, but yet victorious. But
   the war lies here, between that which should be the governing faculty,
   the mind, the practical judgment, the conscience, and the mutinous
   dispositions of a rebellious heart, that are entire, and in their full
   strength, in the unregenerate; whereas, in the regenerate, they are
   subdued and brought under; not quite expelled, but yet conquered.

   Thus, we have the true state of the case, how it is with men with
   respect to the sinfulness of their nature, which lies spread through
   all the several powers and faculties of the soul, and shews itself with
   reference to the several objects wherewith men can be any way
   concerned. But we are to consider,

   (2.) The universality of this revolt; that is, that all men are in it,
   they are all gone back; all men, and the all of every man. All men are
   in it. And it is, therefore, on the whole matter, not strange that this
   corruption of the nature of man should be represented with such
   rhetorick as we find in divers passages of Scripture: as in the xiv.
   and liii. psalms, and Romans 3, where you have divers passages quoted
   out of the Old Testament, especially out of the book of Psalms, of that
   same import, to signify, how general a consent there is in this matter
   of man's rebellion; that as men have agreed herein with infernal
   spirits, so they do generally agree with one another; "Come let us cast
   off his cords, and throw away his bands from off us." All, from the
   highest to the lowest, agreeing in such a design as this.

   If you would take a brief view of the state of the case, that iii. of
   the Romans will give it you very shortly and succinctly, and yet with
   all, very copiously and fully. The apostle tells us, that he had
   proved, (as indeed he had done in the i. and ii. chapters of that
   epistle) that "Jews and Gentiles were under sin." Those two
   distributing terms, Jew and Gentile, taking up the whole of the world,
   and was then the known distribution of the world of mankind. And he had
   not only said it, but proved it, that they were all under sin; even the
   very Jews themselves, as well as Gentiles, though a select people, a
   people that had the oracles of God, the peculiar tokens of his presence
   and favour, (where grace was not victorious,) yet, as great an enmity
   appears among them, against God, as in the pagan world and nations of
   the earth.

   And if you look into the i. Romans, and the latter end, you see, that
   men having expelled and driven God out of their minds and thoughts, as
   not liking to retain him in their knowledge, what becomes of them
   hereupon? Why, God gives them up, leaves them to themselves: they
   become now to be under the dominion and power of exorbitant and unruly
   affections and passions. "God gave them up to vile affections; and as
   they liked not to retain God in their knowledge, he gave them over to a
   reprobate mind:" and hereupon, they are tilled with all
   unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
   full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers,
   backbiters: and, (that which is central of all the rest, which was
   noted before,) haters of God: despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of
   evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant
   breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.

   Here is a representation of the apostate world, of that wickedness
   which all proceeds from the corrupt fountain which every man hath in
   himself. And then, in the 3 chapter, he goes on to add, from the
   Psalmist: "There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that
   understandeth, none that seeketh after God, they are all gone out of
   the way, they are altogether be come unprofitable: there is none that
   doeth good, no not one." "All have sinned and come short of the glory
   of God, both as it was to be their end, and as it was to be their
   transforming pattern. Thus it is, as to all men.

   And so, the all of every man: which divers expressions in that iii.
   Romans do most emphatically represent and hold forth to us. "Their
   throat is an open sepulchre, with their mouths they have used deceit,
   the poison of asps is under their lips: their mouth is full of cursing
   and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and
   misery are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known."
   Even the several parts of the outward man are made use of, as so many
   engines and machines for wickedness. And for the inward man, the source
   and fountain of it, we are elsewhere told, that "all the imaginations
   of the thoughts of the heart are only evil; and continually" so; Gen.
   vi. 5. So early had that universal contagion spread itself among all
   men, and through the all of every man.

   And hence it is, that they are so frequently spoken of, (even
   notwithstanding a profession of God's own name, if they remain in the
   unrenewed state,) as "a generation of vipers, and as a seed of evil
   doers;" yea, (as was said before,) as the seed of the devil, that old
   serpent. "Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father
   ye will do." And hence it is, that all wickedness do proceed, which we
   have any where seen perpetrated and done, upon the stage of this world.
   So that when the renewing work comes to take place, there is need that
   it should pervade, should pass through, the whole man. "The God of
   peace, sanctify you throughout in your whole spirit, soul and body."
   You see, every part of man needs a sanctifying influence; and
   therefore, all is corrupt and impure.

   Before we go on, let us make somewhat of present useful reflection to
   ourselves. And consider, Is it not, hereupon, wonderful that there
   should be among men so general a self-complacency? How strange is it,
   that this being the state of the case with men in this world, there
   should be among them, I say, so general a self-complacency? that they
   all should seem to be so well pleased with themselves? look with a kind
   eye upon themselves? that it doth not come into men's minds to think,
   antecedently to their recovery, to their regeneration, "I am a fallen
   creature, an apostate creature, one separate and cut off from God, by
   mine own revolt; one fallen in with the devil against God; that am in
   league with him to do his will, and to disobey him who gave me breath;
   who is the Father of my spirit, and the Author of my whole being."

   Are not these true thoughts that a man might think of himself, being
   yet unregenerate, unrenewed? And is it not strange, when they are
   things that lie so much in view, they yet should so seldom come into
   men's minds? Can we think it possible, if they did come oftener, that
   they should be so well pleased with themselves? Yet this, they are
   generally prone to be. It is the character of the wicked man; that is,
   one that continues yet in a state of apostasy, that t( he flatters
   himself in his own eyes, (Psalm xxxvi. 2.) until his iniquity be found
   to be hateful." He still looks upon himself with a self-flattering eye.
   If there be any thing which, abstractly considered, may be looked upon
   as amiable, this is singly looked upon: but it is seldom, in the mean
   time, thought, but generally forgot, what is a man's state.

   O! how few are there that cry out, "What is the state of my case? If I
   have strength, if I have wit, if I have any thing of comeliness, I can
   presently strut, and think, What a fine creature am I? But, in the mean
   time, that I am a rebel against heaven; I am an accomplice with the
   devil against God; I am an apostate from my Rightful, Sovereign Lord."
   This would surely turn all man's self-complacency into horror and
   consternation, that a man would be afraid of himself, and wish he could
   run away from himself; and wonder how the earth comes to bear such a
   creature. O! this monster of an apostate soul that is off from God, and
   without a disposition or inclination to return to him, carries so much
   of horror and prodigy with it, that it is strange all are not filled
   with fright and amazement, till they find some manifest proof of a
   regenerating, transforming grace upon their spirits:" it is strange
   that, till then, they are not a continual terror to themselves.

LECTURE XXVI. [41]

   But that which doth yet give us a fuller and more dreadful account of
   this state of the case, is, besides the consideration we are to have,
   what man is in himself, and in his faculties and powers, precisely
   considered, which do make up the sinfulness of his state, and which
   might be mentioned under this head, is,

   (3.) The aggravations of man's sinfulness.

   [1.] We are to bethink ourselves, therefore, with whom there is a
   coincidency, and into what society and combination he falls, in this
   his corrupt state: and so, take the state of the case briefly and
   summarily thus; that he is, in all this, an accomplice with those
   apostate, disloyal, infernal spirits, that had revolted, and were
   fallen from God before: an amazing consideration! In all this, he is in
   confederation and combination with devils, with the powers of hell and
   darkness, against his Rightful and Sovereign Lord. And so doth the
   Scripture most expressly speak in divers places: so far as that the
   devil comes thereupon, to be stiled, "The god of this world," who "hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not." 2 Cor. iv. 4.

   And O! that we could consider this, according to what it doth import
   and carry in it of horror and detestableness. It is a thing that we do
   not yet believe, that a world inhabited by reasonable creatures, God's
   own offspring, are universally fallen into a confederacy and
   combination with another god, with an enemy-god, an adversary-god,
   against the living and true God. Men have changed their God. And what a
   fearful choice have they made! fallen into a league with those wicked
   creatures that were weary of his government before, and that were,
   thereupon, thrown down into an abyss of darkness, and bound up in the
   chains thereof, unto the judgment of the great day. But doth the
   Scripture say this in vain? or hath it not a meaning, when it calls the
   devil, "The god of this world?" O! with what amazement should it strike
   our hearts, to think that so it is; that the whole order of creatures
   is gone off from God, and fallen into a confederacy with the devil and
   his an gels, against their Rightful, Sovereign Lord.

   It is not a thing spoken (as it were) once on the bye; but the
   Scripture doth industriously represent this as the settled state of the
   case with men. Look to the Ephes. ii. 1. "You hath he quickened, who
   were dead in trespasses and sins: wherein we all had our conversation
   in times past, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind."
   And under whose regimen is this? Why, "according to the course of this
   world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that
   now worketh in the children of disobedience." They live subject to the
   government of that prince: and that is a long-continued now, referring
   to the whole time and state of the apostasy. It speaks the fixed state
   of this case, that as long as men do remain dead in trespasses and
   sins, as it is in the 1 verse of that chapter; and all the while that
   that death lies upon the world, which, as we are told in the text,
   "hath passed upon all;" all that time, during that long-continued now,
   all their actions, all their motions, all their designs, are "according
   to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that worketh in the
   children of disobedience." they are led captive by him at his will; 2
   Tim. ii. 26. He hath his will of them. "The lusts of your father ye
   will do." John viii. 44. That "will" is not a sign of the tense, but a
   distinct word, "you will;" you will to do the lusts of your father; you
   have a proneness, a propension of will, or it is grateful to your will,
   to do the lusts of your father: the devil is become even a father and a
   god to this apostate world: they are the serpent's seed: he hath (as it
   were) impregnated them with all the principles of malignity and
   disloyalty, against their Rightful, Sovereign Lord.

   Methinks, this should make us afraid of ourselves, and even of one
   another, till there be some appearance of a change in the state of our
   case. We look upon it as a very terrible thing, to have the body of a
   man possessed with the devil: but how much more dreadful is it, to have
   his soul under that possession; acted upon by satan in all his designs
   through the whole of his course, led captive by the devil at his will!
   Waiting if God will give repentance: that is represented as the great
   business of the gospel ministry, and of a gospel minister, as in 2 Tim.
   ii. 24, 25. to wait with patience, and endeavour with gentleness, that
   they may be brought to repentance, and enabled to recover themselves
   out of the snare of the devil, who are led captive by him at his will.
   See what his part then is, as a god over this world; he makes them do
   what he will, he hath his will upon them. "My will is, that you forget
   God; and they do: that you live in a continual contempt of God; and so
   they do: that you mind nothing but the affairs of this world, and how
   to please and gratify your flesh and sense, mind nothing but what
   shall, or shall not, profit your external part, or ensnare and hurt
   you, and undo you; and they do just as he would have them do,
   throughout the whole of their course. So that, in this state of the
   apostasy, they are in a continual confederation as accomplices with
   devils, those apostate spirits, that were gone off from God before.

   [2.] It is a further aggravating consideration of this sinfulness, that
   the understandings of men do all this while remain with them: they have
   their understandings yet about them. Man is still an intelligent
   creature, "There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the
   Almighty hath given him understanding," (Job xxxii. 8.) to distinguish
   him from a brute. It is very true, indeed, if sin had totally unmanned
   men, it had brought them into an utter incapacity of sinning any more.
   If the leading faculty were destroyed quite, he were then no more
   capable of sin than a log. But this makes the matter beyond all
   imagination wonderful, that a man should have his understanding
   remaining, and become such a monster as this; and yet apprehend nothing
   of it: an understanding that he can use about other matters; he can
   discourse, reason, project, lay designs, form methods in reference to
   all things that are of an inferior concernment. We find that in that
   great transformation of that haughty prince Nebuchadnezzar, (whom God
   turned to graze among the wild beasts of the field,) a transformation,
   not of his body, (as we have no reason to think that it was,) but of
   his mind; and we are told, that at the end of so much time, his
   understanding returned to him. But in this common case, men's
   understandings do remain with them all the while they are under this
   monstrous transformation: that is, while a reasonable, immortal spirit
   disaffects his Maker, the Father of spirits; joins itself with clods,
   the base things of this earth; yea, joins itself to devils, apostate,
   impure spirits, and falls into confederacy with them against God: and
   yet men are not aware of their case.

   And this makes that transformation which sin hath wrought in the very
   nature of man, in the soul of man, his reasonable soul, so horrid a
   thing. If he had been transformed into any other bodily shape, (though
   never so monstrous,) it had been incomparably a less monstrous
   translation than this: to make a reasonable, understanding creature,
   engage in a contest against him that gave him breath, the Author and
   Parent of his life and being, nothing could be a more monstrous thing.
   If all these metamorphoses which poets feign, had generally taken place
   and effect, every where among men; if they had been transformed into
   trunks of trees and the like, (as hath been feigned concerning divers,)
   it had been a less strange, a less fearful transformation than this; a
   reasonable, intelligent, immortal spirit turned against his Maker; and
   intent upon razing out every thing of his holy image out of itself.

   Now this understanding still remaining, the persisting in a way and
   course of sin, is a running counter to that light and knowledge which
   every man hath, in a degree, remaining in him, though it is but a
   dubious kind of twilight; light that doth rather admit to be called
   "darkness." "If the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that
   darkness?" that is, it is ineffectual to answer the proper purposes of
   a directive, practical light: yet what doth remain thereof, doth serve
   most highly to aggravate the wickedness of them in whom it is.

   This is that which is more than intimated, when men are required to
   shew themselves men; as it is in Isaiah xlvi. 8. You have the proper
   principles of humanity yet about you, and the great distinguishing
   principle of reason, that exalts you above inferior creatures: you have
   it in you, but you do not use it; you are men, but you do not shew it:
   "Shew yourselves men ye transgressors." And again, psalm liii.. 4.
   "Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?" It is implied that
   they have it, but they will not use it: the interrogation is a more
   forcible affirmation; men have knowledge in them, yet transgress: and
   so keep up a contest and a war against God, and against themselves. And
   again,

   [3.] It is a further most aggravating consideration, that as, in
   general, they have understanding about them, and still remaining with
   them, they have also some natural notions of God, all the while they
   are thus at war with him, and in this defiance against him. Still they
   have the natural impress of God upon their minds that they cannot raze
   out; so that they do not fight against him altogether in the dark;
   "Light shines in the midst of that darkness which comprehends it not."
   That light by which God reveals himself, not only round about them, but
   in them; there is that which might be known of God in every man, as in
   that Rom. i. 19. That which might be known of God is manifest in them,
   for God hath revealed it to them.

   And there is, hereupon, such a thing as natural religion: for while
   they have a notion of God in their minds, it is not as of a Being
   irrelative to them, but it is as an Object of worship; an Object of
   trust, so as that commonly men, in their last necessities, untaught and
   uninstructed, do pray to him. As I remember that ancient, (Minutius
   Foelix,) in opposition to pagan ism, asserting the oneness of the
   Deity, and that God whom the Christians serve, speaks thus: "You
   yourselves (saith he) when any thing ails you and are in distress, do
   not you use to lift up your eyes and hands to heaven? vulgi isti
   naturalis est sermo, this is as a natural kind of prayer, which your
   own nature doth even constrain you to, whether you will or no; there is
   a natural susceptibleness of religion. Men are instructed by nature
   itself, to dread a superior Being, and to place some kind of dependance
   upon it, and to have some kind of expectation from it, of help and
   relief in their necessities and distresses, and yet remain, all this
   while, in an apostasy, in war and rebellion.

   This makes this monster of an apostate creature to be so much the more
   monstrous, beyond comparison; even beyond all that can be thought. The
   case being thus with them, that such sentiments of God as they have
   about them, they cannot erase, and yet, cannot obey; they can never get
   them out of them, nor comply with them: this is their case. So
   monstrous a thing as an unregenerate creature that remains yet in the
   apostate state. They carry about a notion of God with them in their
   minds wherever they go: and so have not only reason left them, but
   somewhat of religion; which some take to be a more distinguishing
   property in man than reason itself, it being less disputable whether it
   do peculiarly belong to man; to inferior creatures it manifestly doth
   not: and in great measure it is evident that it doth belong to all men.
   For those that have been the most diligent inquirers into the state of
   the world, in former ages, among the pagans themselves, have taken
   notice that it was even an impossible thing to hear of a man any where
   that had not somewhat of religion, or some sense of a Deity in him. As,
   I remember, Plutarch saith: "It is not impossible to find cities
   without walls, without government, without coin:" but to find a city
   without religion, he thought to be altogether impossible. "And it were
   (saith he) as easy a thing to build a city without a foundation,
   without ground to set it on, as to form a society of men without
   religion." This was the apprehension of such knowing men as he and
   others, even among heathens themselves, in former times.

   And this is the general matter of God's controversy with the world,
   when we are told in that Romans i. 18. that "the wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
   who hold the truth in unrighteousness." What that truth is, we are to
   collect from what follows in the 19 ver. before mentioned: for that
   which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath revealed it
   to them. He hath so inwrought his name, his own idea, into the spirits
   of men, that there it remains as an indelible impress, not quite to be
   razed out. And therefore, they who have been more avowed atheists, have
   been so, more in endeavour than in fact; endeavouring to extinguish
   those notions of God out of their minds, which yet they could never rid
   themselves of. "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." He
   hath said it in his heart: not with his mouth, not in his mind, but in
   his heart; which implies it rather a wish than an assertion. And so,
   the hebrew text doth lead us to understand: for there is not the copula
   to make it an assertion: The fool hath said in his heart, "no God;" not
   that there is none, that is not in the text, but--"no God;" let there
   be none: or, O! that there were none: I wish there were none. It is
   rather a wish than an assertion with these fools. And these fools, they
   are the generality of the apostate world.

   But that men should carry that notion in their minds about them, up and
   down the world; have (as it were) God so much in view, (if they will
   but look into themselves and commune with their own minds,) and yet
   should be continually warring and fighting against him, when they could
   not but at the same time conceive him to be God, but conceive him too,
   to be the very Author of their life and being; "He in whom (as the
   apostle quotes a heathen poet saying) they live and move and have their
   being;" and another saying, "Whose offspring they are:" his very
   offspring; and yet in a continual, general rebellion against him; this
   aggravates the matter beyond all measure. And again,

   [4.] They have in them also, the practical principles of right and
   wrong, in reference to one another. In this state of apostasy from God,
   they have, I say, practical principles; that is, principles that ought
   to govern practice, telling them what is right, and what is wrong, in
   reference to one another, as well as in reference to God: and yet,
   there is nothing else but aversion, hating of one another, and
   designing against one another, and every one labouring to tear the
   world in pieces, that they may grasp into their own hands, what yet
   lies in other men's. They do so far know what is right and wrong in
   reference to one another, that they can no sooner hear of the general
   measures of right and wrong among them, but their minds do inwardly
   consent to the reasonableness of such a constitution. As that great
   maxim of our Saviour; "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do
   ye so to them," as being that which sums up the law and the prophets. A
   saying so taken, even among heathens themselves, that it is known, that
   the emperor Alexander Severus, caused it to be inscribed on the gates
   of his palace, as if it were the most suitable, agreeable thing to the
   minds of men, and to the necessities of human society, that could be
   thought. And,

   [5.] Yet further, they have all this while a most connatural desire of
   their own felicity. This is a further aggravation, that every man
   naturally desires to be happy, when yet, he is continually engaged in a
   way and course of sin, against his Sovereign, Rightful Lord, which so
   directly tends to involve him in all misery: and so, is doing perpetual
   violence to himself, and even to the law of his own nature; for there
   cannot be a more radical principle in any man, or even in the nature of
   man, gene rally considered, than to desire to be happy. "Who will shew
   us any good?" is the common vogue, according to that of the Psalmist in
   the 4, psalm. All the world is full of craving desires after felicity,
   after a happy state, and yet running on in a continued course directly
   counter hereunto; fighting every where against the desire of their own
   hearts.

   [6.] It is a further aggravating consideration too, that, in all this
   time, they have some apprehension with them generally of a future state
   in another world, the soul of man having a secret consciousness of its
   own immortality inwrought into it. So that (as you have heard) mere
   irreligion hath been a thing very rarely to be known in the world, and
   never but as men have pretended and endeavoured to erase and root out
   the principles of religion out of their own souls; but without total
   effect. So there hath been no sort of religion in the world that hath
   not proceeded upon the supposition of a future immortality. Not only
   christians and jews, but mahometans and the grosser pagans, have all
   agreed in this one sentiment, that "there is a life to come," and a
   state after this. And yet, they are continually taking the way that
   takes hold of hell, and leads, down to the chambers of death; though
   that sentiment is not more natural, more common, that there is another
   state, another world, a life to come, than the sentiment is, of the
   connexion between goodness and blessedness, and between wickedness and
   misery. They have generally apprehended so, as the apostle, in the
   close of the first chapter of this epistle (referring to the gentile
   world) saith: "They did know the righteous judgment of God, and that
   they who did those things were worthy of death, and yet, not only did
   the same, but took pleasure in them." They did apprehend a connexion
   between wickedness and death, between sin and misery, and yet run the
   course which corrupt inclination carried them unto, without resistance.
   And again,

   [7.] There is in them all this while, a self-reflecting power, by which
   they are capable of taking knowledge of themselves, of looking in upon
   their own minds. "The spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord,
   searching into the innermost parts of the belly;" that is, searching
   into his most inward penetralia, into all the secret recesses of
   itself, even to the very centre. It is such a kind of light as can
   invert its beams, and turn them inward upon itself; being therein a
   nobler sort of eye, than this external bodily one is. For this exterior
   bodily eye of ours that sees all other things, cannot see itself; but
   the mind, the intellectual eye, cannot only see other things, but can
   see itself too, is capable of contemplating itself. That conscience
   that is in man, that natural conscience, it is not only the
   conservatory of natural principles, the seat of them, that shew what
   men are to do, and what they are not to do, (as was told you before,
   under the former head,) but it is also a self-reflecting principle,
   that which is called properly and more strictly, suneidesis, by which a
   person is conscious to himself what he is, and what he doth; what his
   dispositions are, and what the series and tendency of his actions are.

   And yet, this principle is rarely used; rarely, in reflecting upon
   actions, and in reflecting upon their states; scarcely ever in
   reflecting upon their actions, very rarely; so that, among a people
   professing the name of God, he may long hearken, and hear none saying,
   What have I done? "I hearkened and heard: no man spake aright; no man
   said, What have I done?" Jer. viii. 6. Though they have that
   self-reflective principle in them, by which they are capable of taking
   cognizance of their own actions, they never do it, never allow
   themselves to say, What have I done? in a long continued tract of time.
   But every following day passeth as former days have done; and seldom,
   from morning till night, is there a self-reflecting thought.

   Indeed, where natural light hath been improved, even among some
   heathens, they tell us it should be otherwise: Vir bonus et sapiens; a
   good, a wise man, will not go to bed at night, will not compose himself
   to rest, before he hath revolved with himself the actions of the day.
   So we are taught by a heathen instructor. But, though there have been
   some such instances, they are very rare, of those that allow themselves
   to reflect upon their actions; but much more rare, of those that
   reflect upon their state, that bethink themselves, or say, a In what
   state am I? How do things stand between God and me, whose creature I
   am, and under whose government I live?" And yet, again,

   [8.] It doth more highly aggravate all this wickedness, to consider,
   how inflexible men are, and averse to compliance with any means and
   methods for their reduction, whether they that are without the gospel,
   or they that live under it. For those that are without it, that have no
   gospel, no verbal gospel, among them, such an aversion to all the
   methods of recovery doth very sufficiently appear: for, otherwise, if
   that were not the common temper of the world, even where the gospel is
   not yet come, it would soon be among them, and nothing could have
   hindered it from spreading over all the world many ages ago, but an
   indisposition and opposition in the minds and spirits of men to the
   progress and diffusion of it. For there hath been no nation where the
   gospel was, but they that were hitherto destitute of the gospel, some
   or other of them, must have lain next to that nation where the gospel
   was, so that it was impossible for them not to have heard the sound
   thereof: and, if there were not an indisposition in them, even in the
   minds of men, and a contrariety and disaffection, they would, at least,
   have been inquisitive; they would have examined--"Is such a declaration
   from God, or is it not?" which, if they had, it carries with it such
   undeniable characters of divinity, that inquiring minds could not long
   have been ignorant; but prejudice and disaffection have kept off the
   inquiry; which, if it had taken effect in one country, it would soon
   have reached another, and so another, till the world had been leavened
   with the gospel long ago. There fore, such aversion and disaffection to
   the gospel appears even where there hath no gospel yet come.

   Besides that, even there, though there be no verbal gospel, there is
   somewhat of a real one, that God shews himself placable, or no
   implacable, no inflexible, no irreconcilable enemy. He doth not carry
   it with men generally as one seeking their destruction, leaves not
   himself without witness, in that he doth good, and gives them rain from
   heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and
   gladness, as in Acts xiv. and xvii. So the apostle speaks of God, in
   reference to his dispensations towards the pagan world; and he saith it
   unto pagans: "He makes his sun to shine on the just and on the unjust:"
   and requires of us, upon that very ground, to love our enemies, because
   he shews so very, much philanthropy, and good will towards men. "Love
   your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
   and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you, that
   you may be the children of your Father, which is in heaven;" (Matt. v.
   44, 45.) that you may appear such, that you may represent herein a
   Godlike nature; for God doth so, making his goodness diffuse and spread
   itself through the world: so that, "the whole earth is full of his
   goodness;" though it be so full of men's wickedness. And, Romans ii. 4.
   "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and
   long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance?" As we have copiously shewn from that text, that there is a
   manifest, discernible leadingness and ducture in the continued exercise
   of God's goodness, and particularly of his patience and forbearance,
   unto repentance.

   But where the gospel is, there, this disaffection and prejudice doth
   most apparently and conspicuously shew itself. Not only were the pagans
   of old accused to be "God-haters," (Rom. i. 30,) where he speaks of the
   Gentile world, but the very Jews too, where God's light did shine, and
   where his grace and saving design did appear, and were most expressly
   testified; even of them our Saviour saith, "Ye have both seen and hated
   me and my Father," John v. 24. And hence came these complaints, even
   where the gospel is: "I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength
   for nought and in vain." Isaiah xlix. 4. And, "Who hath believed our
   report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Isaiah liii. 1.
   quoted by the apostle, Romans x. 16. "Have they all obeyed the
   gospel?"--No; far from that; for Isaiah saith, "Who hath believed our
   report?" And in the close of that chapter, "All the day long have I
   spread forth my hands to a gainsaying and rebellious people."

   The experienced unsuccessfulness of the gospel, which we generally so
   much see cause to complain of and bemoan, speaks this continually. What
   representations have we of God, in Christ, intent upon a reconciling
   design! But how few are won! How few hearts touched! So that men are
   gone off from God, and there they affect to abide; they have chosen
   distance from God, and seem resolved to continue it, say we to them
   what we will or can. We speak to them in the name of the Lord, but they
   will not hear; and for the sake of their own souls, but they regard it
   not. And, which is still,

   [9.] More aggravating, that is, it is a further addition to the load of
   aggravations, and adds unspeakably to it; men are all this while
   certain they must die; they are in no doubt concerning that; they know
   the things they are fallen in with, in opposition to God, can be
   enjoyed by them but a little while; they see not only that the fashion
   of this world passeth away, but they find themselves passing away;
   changes are upon them. It is a thing concerning which they can be in no
   doubt; they have no instance of any one that escaped death. And yet
   here is generally no consideration what shall become of them hereafter.
   They find they are not happy here, they are still crying and seeking to
   be happy, but obtain it not: and yet they have no concern to be happy
   hereafter; though they know they must be gone, and their places on
   earth will, in a little while, know them no more. They have continual
   instances before their eyes, of other wicked ones like themselves
   driven away in their wickedness, torn up by the roots, plucked from
   their dwelling place and gone: they know it must shortly be so with
   them too; and yet have chosen a state of distance from God; they never
   look after him, till (it may be) their last vain dying breath is
   uttered in some such unreasonable desire as this: "Lord have mercy upon
   me:" when they can live and sin no longer, then they cry to God for
   mercy.

   These are all most fearful aggravations of this common wickedness that
   prevails in every one; and serves farther to represent to us the
   sinfulness of man in his fallen state. I should next come to speak of
   the death that hereupon passeth over all men, as we have spoken of
   death as it befel that one, as it stood in the commination, and as it
   stood in the sentence. It requiring a further, and, somewhat, a
   distinct consideration, with reference to the universality of man,
   whose case doth (though not substantially, yet in very great and
   important circumstances) differ from him who was the first
   transgressor. But before I come to that, some use of this
   representation which hath been made of the sinfulness of man's state,
   should intervene.

LECTURE XXVII. [42]

   And there are many things which it is obvious to us to take notice of,
   for our instruction and use, from hence. As,

   1. We may see, hereupon, how altered a creature man is; how little he
   is himself; or what that one man, by whom sin and death entered, at
   first was. You have lately heard in what estate God did at first create
   man: "So God made man after his own image," a Godlike creature. Such a
   thing was man at first; thence called the son of God. "Who was the son
   of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God." Luke iii.
   38. A glorious pedigree run up backward, in its assent, as high as
   heaven; "who was the son of God." And it is not supposable that God
   should raise up a son immediately from himself, unlike himself.
   Therefore, it was very suitable unto the state of things, that it
   should be so expressly told us, "God made man in his own image," which
   you have heard was to be understood not only of his natural image, as
   man hath a spirit in him that was naturally, essentially vital,
   intelligent, free, and immortal; but it was also, and more principally,
   to be understood of the moral image, comprehending both sanctity and
   felicity, and, according to which, man was made a happy, and a holy
   creature, pure and blessed.

   How unlike himself is he now become! Let none of us think that this
   concerns not us. Are we not also of the posterity of Adam, degenerate
   creatures, fallen from the original excellency of our own nature, and
   especially in respect of that conformity and inclination which were in
   our nature towards God, our great and common Parent? If any of you had
   a son that was newly gone forth from you, and you met him by and by,
   and he doth not know you; You tell him, "I am your father;" he replies,
   "No, it is no such thing, you are no father of mine;" would it not cut
   your heart? Who would not look upon it as a deplorable case? This is
   the common case; men are sunk into such deep ignorance and oblivion of
   God, the Author of their being, that now they retain no knowledge, no
   remembrance of him, no conformity to him, no inclination toward their
   ancient Original,

   It is an amazing thing that it should be so! It is much more amazing
   that it should be so little considered, that this earth should be
   peopled with such inhabitants, every one having in him (that is, all
   that are of human race,) an intelligent, immortal spirit, a mind
   capable of thought, capable of just thought, capable of duty, and
   capable of blessedness. But so miserably sunk into carnality and
   earthliness, that this body in which it should but dwell, therein it
   rots, therein it putrifies. And that which (as hath been said) was
   designed to be its mansion, is become its dormitory, and its grave. A
   living soul carnalized! A most horrid creature I And, as it is said,
   Adam was at first a living soul: ("so God breathed into him the breath
   of life, (that pure, divine, and heavenly breath;) and he became a
   living soul,") so, then to have asked the question, "What is man?" must
   have been to receive the answer, "He is a living soul: he is all soul,
   and that soul all life." But now is this living soul buried in flesh, a
   lost thing to all the true, and great, and noble ends and purposes of
   that life which was at first given it.

   It is true, indeed, that this is a thing much less than what is said of
   the second Adam, in that 1 Cor. xv. 45. "The first man Adam was made a
   living soul; the second man Adam was a quickening spirit." This latter
   is a great deal more. A living soul signified him to live himself: but
   a quickening spirit signifies a power to make others live. That, the
   first Adam could not do: the more excellent kind of life which he had,
   (for there was a complication of lives in the first creation of this
   man,) he could not lose; but he could not give. He could not lose it
   from himself; but he could never have given it by any power or
   immediate efficiency of his own to another. Here, the second Adam, the
   constitution of the second Adam, was far above that of the first, in
   that he could quicken others; a quickening spirit, not only quickened
   passively, but quickened actively, such a spirit as could give spirit,
   and diffuse life.

   But take this matter as it was--"The first man Adam was a living soul."
   with all that life in him in all the kinds thereof, which was the
   highest and most noble that could belong to a reasonable, intelligent
   soul: such a one he was; and now we have this living soul entombed. It
   is naturally a living soul, and naturally immortal still; but as unapt
   to serve and answer the proper purposes of that life which was at first
   given it, as if it were quite dead, dead towards God. It was
   principally alive towards him: that holy life which did belong to
   Adam's soul at first, could have none but God as its highest and
   noblest term: upon him it was terminated. Therefore, where there is a
   restitution and recovery, this is the immediate effect, persons do
   "become dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ." Rom. vi.
   11. And here is now a living soul alive to sin, but dead towards God;
   dead towards the prime and most glorious Object; and dead to all the
   noble operations, for which it was originally and first made a living
   soul. And this is the state of man: like the living God in this respect
   he was; but now, towards him he is become a dead thing, putrid, and
   noisome, and offensive, even as a carcass. He is dead in that respect,
   wherein a soul may be said to be dead, which cannot be in a natural
   sense, as you have heard, and as is plain in itself; but only in a
   moral sense. In that sense wherein it can be said to be dead, in that
   sense, it must be the most fearful alteration which hath passed upon
   it, that could he passed upon a creature: that is, it was alive towards
   God; and is become dead towards him, cut off from him by a
   self-separation. Therein lies the sinfulness of this death that we are
   considering, and which belongs to the present subject we have in hand
   to consider. That God hath hereupon retired from him; that is the
   punitive notion of this death. But the sinful notion of it lies in its
   severing, retiring, and withdrawing itself from God; plucking itself
   away from him, as it hath done in the apostasy; and as it every where
   doth as long as the state of apostasy is continued in.

   Now it is become a most unlike creature to God, and most unlike unto
   its original self, that could be thought. It was a knowing, intelligent
   creature; and especially knowing God. This image of God, that was at
   first impressed upon it, stood in knowledge; now it is become ignorant
   of God, "alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is
   in it, and the blindness of the heart." Ephes. iv. 18. It was like him
   in knowledge; but now it is become most stupidly ignorant of what it is
   most concerned in. Is this Godlike? It was a holy, pure creature; but
   now delighting to wallow in the impurest sensualities. Is this like
   God? It was a most orderly, regular creature; but now all confusion;
   its powers engaged in war against one another; the whole frame of man
   disorganized, the whole dependance of will and affections upon, what
   should lead them, an intelligent mind and judgment; but these shattered
   all to pieces. The whole frame is discomposed. Is this like the God of
   order? O! how unlike to God is man now become! And therein unlike
   himself, and unlike what he at first was. But,

   2. We may further learn, hence, that this world cannot, hereupon, but
   lie under divine displeasure. And it is most just and righteous that it
   should do so. This, the law gives sufficient intimation of, wheresoever
   it comes: That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
   guilty before God." Romans iii. 19. Impleadable at law, that is the
   import of the word there used, to signify God's having a just and legal
   controversy with all this world. He hath in point of law, that to be
   said against it, which can never be answered; which admits of no
   apology, no defence. But again,

   3. We may yet further learn, hence, that the sinfulness which hath
   spread itself among men in this world, cannot but be in a true sense
   natural, such as hath poisoned the very nature of man with an enmity
   and malignity against God: for you see it is universal. Nothing can be
   supposed to be common, but what must be understood to have some common
   cause, a cause that is common. But the text tells us, that "all have
   sinned." And whereas, (as was noted to you formerly,) it is said in the
   iii. chapter of this epistle, ver. 9, "We have before proved both Jews
   and Gentiles to be all under sin;" (which Jews and Gentiles did divide
   the world;) and "There is none righteous, no not one," as the same
   apostle quotes from psalm the xiv.th and liii. This plainly speaks this
   contagion to have infected the nature of man, and to run with his
   propagated nature every where, from age to age, and from generation to
   generation.

   It appears to be so, for that when, upon the general defection and
   revolt of this world from God, he was pleased yet, (in order to his
   asserting and preserving some interest therein,) to select to himself
   one people, one people to be peculiar to him; all the endearing favours
   of providence, all the peculiar manifestations of light from heaven,
   all the intercourse that, in a more external way, God vouchsafed to
   hold with this people, (unless he did here and there powerfully
   transform their hearts,) still left them evidently as full of
   malignity, and of the enmity of wickedness against God, as if they had
   been the merest strangers to him in all the world. And, therefore, is
   he some times represented as calling heaven and earth as astonished
   witnesses against them: "Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth, I have
   nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me."
   Isaiah i. 2. "My people would not hearken to my voice, Israel would
   have none of me." Psalm lxxxi. 11. "He came to his own, but they
   received him not;" John i. 11. What can this signify, but a deep
   depravedness of nature? Sin hath inwrought itself even into the very
   nature of man.

   We have the same instances multiplied in the days of the gospel. God
   hath shewn more peculiar favours, vouchsafed distinguishing privileges
   of the highest external kind, unto sundry nations into which the light
   of the gospel hath spread itself. But where is there greater wickedness
   in all the world, than in the Christian world? where greater, than in
   reformed Christendom, as it is called? Where is there more avowed
   atheism? where is there higher insolency against heaven? more direct
   and open rebellion, tearing all the constitutions and laws, which they
   themselves pretend to own for divine und Christian? A deep depravedness
   this must argue.

   You may see in the continual springing up of one generation after
   another, that even from infancy, sin still springs up with reason, and
   the improvements of the natural faculties. So that as soon as any do
   begin to act rationally, they begin to act wickedly. Heathens have
   observed it, and speak of it with regret, and take notice how a child
   neglected, grows monstrously vicious: common experience tells us this.
   Education, indeed, (which therefore ought to be practised with a great
   deal more care and diligence than it is,) doth somewhat repress, but it
   doth not change and alter nature. You see that the corruption of it
   proceeds, even with the nature itself, from the immediate fountain.
   "Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive
   me;" so the penitent Psalmist confesseth concerning himself; Psalm li.
   5. And it is generally spoken concerning the wicked, (as all the world
   doth naturally appear to be,) that "they are estranged from the womb,
   and go astray as soon as they are born." Psalm lviii. 3.

   This was a notion that did obtain so much among the Jews, that you see
   with what severity some of the worst of them fall upon the blind man:
   (John ix. 34.) "Thou wast altogether born in sin, and dost thou teach
   us?" implying, that he who would take upon him, in an extraordinary
   way, (not being called,) to be a teacher and instructor to others, must
   be some very extraordinary person, must be born a sinless man. A
   testimony that they give against themselves unawares: for they had such
   a Teacher among them, but regarded him not; a Teacher that came forth
   from God, and that was not born in sin. "Thou art altogether born in
   sin, no better than any other man, and dost thou take upon thee to
   teach us?" And again,

   4. We may further learn, hence, how little reason men have to think it
   strange, that the state of things in the world is not so constantly
   favourable, or so benign to them, as they could wish, or are apt to
   expect; that they meet with many things so ungrateful; that men find
   themselves subject to pain, sicknesses, crosses, in the course of
   providence; that they meet with disappointments so often; that so many
   are reduced to straits, and wants, and distresses; pinching poverty and
   the like; that there is so much of confusion and disorder and violence
   in the world, the inhabitants of it ready to tear one another and the
   world in pieces. Why, all have sinned. This gives an easy, ready
   account. O! how little is it considered when people are so full of
   complaints of their own particular ails and evils. "Nobody's case is
   like mine. How am I injured and wronged by some or other that are
   stronger and mightier than I? My right is withheld from me," and the
   like. Alas! poor creature, dost thou so little consider how thou hast
   wronged God, and withheld from him his right in thyself, in thy life
   and soul, and all thy powers? Saith another, "I have a child sprung up
   in my family, I have a son that is undutiful and rebellious, a
   perpetual vexation to me." How little is it considered that thou hast
   carried it with much more undutifulness towards God, who was the
   original Author and Parent of thy very life and being. You think, when
   you are sick, you suffer a very great hardship; you do not consider
   what it is to have been a sinner, to have torn the constitutions and
   laws of heaven, and violated the government of the Supreme and Rightful
   Lord of all. "Why doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment
   of his sin?" Lam. iii. 39. "Let us search and try our ways;" let us
   once but take a clear view of our own ways, and that will stop the
   complaint. Consider what a vile creature I have been; so many years of
   my time gone, and I have never minded God; never paid him a duty; never
   thought of him with any reverence; never designed him any service;
   never resolved on living to him, but to myself. And yet, now, a little
   affliction that grates upon the flesh, makes us cry out "O! how hardly
   are we dealt with." Again,

   5. Have all sinned? Then instead of complaining, wonder at the divine
   patience, that things are no worse with the inhabitants of this world
   than they are; that men are allowed a being in it; that this world is
   not turned into flames over the offender's cars; that they are not
   continually pursued with divine terrors; that he is not, with more
   dreadful severity, exacting his right from his own creatures whom he
   made, (as their own under standings can tell them,) not for themselves,
   but for himself: and nobody minds him, when they so generally behave
   themselves with such insolency in this world, as if they had been the
   creators of it, as if they had made the heavens and the earth; sun,
   moon, and stars, and all things, the help and influence whereof they
   any way enjoy.

   How admirable, I say, is the divine patience, that bears with offending
   creatures, lets them propagate and transmit their like from age to age,
   and from generation to generation, through that vast tract of time as
   hath hitherto past, since the apostasy? With what wonderment should we
   consider this power of divine patience! Who that hath it in his hands
   to right himself for such indignities and wrongs, would refrain? When
   we think how quickly, how easily he can do himself right; can frown or
   wink such a world as this into distraction in a moment; that as it
   sprung up by his fiat, "Let it be," how easily could he frown it into
   nothing! Yet he lets men live, lets them live neglecting him, when they
   have natures capable of adoration. But again we have,

   6. Much more reason to admire the divine bounty towards such creatures:
   not only that he spares and lets them live, but that he maintains them,
   and keeps them in life and being, each one for his measured time, and
   so, provided that there should be a transmission of life from age to
   age, in so continued a course. How admirable should the divine bounty
   and munificence be in our eyes, upon this account! He doth good to the
   unthankful and evil; to those that never thank him for it. If you did
   but feed a brute creature, it would be brought by degrees, and in time,
   to take some kind of notice of you, with gratitude. "The ox knows his
   owner, and the ass his master's crib, but Israel doth not know, my
   people will not consider." Men will not know their Owner, though the ox
   knows his. It is your Owner that cares for you; as who provides for the
   ox and the ass, but the owner? So God, as the Owner of you and of all
   the inhabitants of this world, all the children of men, (for I speak of
   these inhabitants,) he doth his part towards you and them. He provides
   for them, he maintains them, and affords them all that is suitable and
   needful for their support; but they will not take that notice of their
   Owner, which an ox or an ass takes of his. How wonderful a thing is
   this on God's part! how horrid a thing on man's!

   I have thought of it many times, and it would be a thing not unworthy
   of your thoughts and serious contemplations, that we should, in so
   continued a course, find the earth so productive as it is of all
   things, not only necessary for the support of the life of man, but so
   grateful too; such pleasant, delicious fruits in their season: and for
   whom is all this entertainment? For a world of rebels, offending
   creatures; those that never look up; we enjoy all, as if it were our
   own, and never consider, W have a Lord over us, the free Donor of all.
   Again,

   7. Since there are so many sinners in this world, (all have sinned,) it
   is very strange there are so few self-accusers; when the same light,
   and the same rational powers, by which men are capable of sinning, they
   are also capable of understanding themselves to be sinners. There is,
   indeed, a natural conscience in men, and it hath its exercise
   sometimes, and a very impartial exercise, in reference to some cases,
   but how little is there of conscience towards God! "Herein," saith the
   apostle, "do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of
   offence towards God, and towards man." So it is, where once
   regenerating grace comes to restore an entire divine Image in the soul
   again, to do an entire work, to produce a general rectitude in the
   soul, there will be conscience towards God, as well as towards men.
   Towards men: there is among men some conscience, though too often
   violated when interest sways: many do not care whom they injure, to
   advantage themselves; but yet, while they do wrong, they cannot be
   altogether without reflection that they do wrong: and upon such
   accounts, chiefly, they have consciences "accusing, or excusing by
   turns." Rom. ii. 15. But towards God, generally, no conscience at all;
   they live in the world as without him, and their hearts never smite
   them; spend days, and months, and years in vanity; throw away their
   lifetime, so as they are useful for nothing, they were made for; and
   never say--"God have mercy upon us;" never think a serious, reflecting
   thought. So it is with the most; they live at that rate, till in a
   moment they go down into the grave, and never consider what they have
   thrown away; a lifetime in the world, without ever minding the proper
   business of life. But,

   8. We may also learn, hence, to take notice, with wonder, that there is
   so much self-complacency in the world, as one of the most incongruous
   things, the most monstrous incongruity in all the world, that men
   should generally be so well pleased with themselves, If things, in
   external respects especially, be well with them; if they rind
   themselves to be in health; if they have any thing of natural strength
   and vigour about them; especially if they can take notice, they have
   wit above the common rate: if they have wealth; if they have reputation
   and esteem among men: if they have any thing of human dignity or
   grandeur; O! how well pleased are they with themselves, what
   self-admirers are men generally upon such accounts, without even
   considering, (and what a dash would one such thought be to all this,)
   "I am a fallen creature, an apostate creature, a sinner, one with whom
   heaven hath a controversy, a rebel still, if not yet reconciled."
   Strange! that men should be pleased with themselves, and their little
   external circumstances, and forget this, "I am a lapsed creature, and
   under the displeasure of heaven." But again,

   9. We may take notice, hence, of the reason, whence it is, that there
   is so much displeasure and wrath against any, in this world, who look
   towards God and heaven. All have sinned, all are generally in a state
   of sin. It is by wonderful and peculiar grace if there be so much as an
   inclining thought Godward, a thought of returning, if any frame their
   doings (as the prophet's expression is) "to turn to the Lord," this
   presently comes under observation: if men's doings be framed that way,
   if a man's way and course be shaped, so as to look Godward and
   heavenward again, then all that behold it, (and with whom there is not
   the same disposition of mind and spirit,) they are under a judgment,
   under a doom. Noah condemned the world. And as the righteous soul of
   Lot was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked, among whom he
   lived; so, no doubt, he also vexed them only by their observation of
   his better ways. And yet, further,

   10. We have great reason, hereupon, to admire a divine hand and power
   in it, that there hath been any thing of religion preserved and kept
   alive in the world, through the several successions of time, unto this
   day. A world where all have sinned, all have been in apostasy and
   revolt from God, and war against heaven; it is from a mighty divine
   hand that there is any such thing as serious religion. Natural religion
   there is, and an ineffectual thing it is, every where, al most. But for
   serious religion, vital religion, such as shall speak itself to be such
   by a self-demonstrative evidence, that such religion hath been kept
   alive in such a world as this, from age to age, is one of the greatest
   miracles that hath been, wrought in the world since there was one! And
   further,

   11. This serves to let us see how mighty a work regeneration is, or
   which the regenerating grace and Spirit, the Spirit of. repentance,
   have to effect and work upon the soul. It cannot be a slight,
   superficial change that is to be made, where the depravation is so
   universal, and so total. The corruption of human nature, it hath not
   reached so little a way as the surface of the man only; it hath gone
   deep into the penetralia, into the inmost centre, into the very spirit
   of the mind: even that needs a renovation too. "Be not conformed to
   this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." Rom.
   xii. 2. And the like expression in Ephes. iv. 22, 23. "Put off the old
   man that is corrupt through deceitful lusts, and be ye renewed in the
   spirit of your minds." O! do not think slightly of regeneration and
   repentance! think that they must have a mighty work to do; and that it
   must be a very deep change which is to be effected thereby, which must
   reach through a man, into the very inwards of his soul, and go as deep
   as corrupt nature hath done. And, in the last place,

   12. How solicitous, hereupon, should we be, whether any such change
   hath been wrought in us, yea or no? Thus stating our case to ourselves:
   "Once, for certain, I was in apostasy from God, an accomplice of hell,
   with infernal powers, against the Sovereign, Rightful Lord of heaven
   and earth. Do I feel myself under a recovering influence? Am I upon a
   return? Is there anything done, or doing in me, towards a renovation
   and effectual change?" If I be not changed, I am the same apostate
   creature still; that is the state wherein I persist, it carries this
   import with it; as if I should put it into these plain express words:
   "I have apostatised from God, and I will stand by it." This is the
   sense of many a soul, and that which words would truly express, if they
   were used to that effect. But many have the sense in their hearts, and
   yet do not consider that such horrid words as these would only serve to
   express that sense of theirs. "I am an apostate creature, and I will
   stand by it:" this is your sense while you do not turn, all the while
   you have no aim at turning, no design of turning. "I have rebelled from
   God, I have rebelled against him, and this is that which I will abide
   by; I will live and die by it." O! what a horrid thing is an impenitent
   soul! especially under a gospel that makes so many overtures to men, of
   reducing apostates, and of reconciling afresh to God.

LECTURE XXVIII. [43]

   2. Now it remains to speak of what is consequent upon this sinful
   state, to wit, death passing upon all; that which ensues upon this
   universal diffusion, and is, in great part, (as you will hear by and
   by,) complicated therewith. Now in speaking to this death that is said
   "to have passed through all, or over all," it must be in substance the
   same with that death which we have spoken to in the former part of the
   verse, that which befel that one first man. I shall, therefore, speak,
   first, of what is common under this notion of death; and then,
   secondly, come to consider the gradual differences afterwards.

   (1.) For what this death signifies here in common, the larger discourse
   whereof I referred to this place. Why,

   [1.] We must consider in it, that bodily death which (in common
   experience) all do undergo according to divine appointment. "It is
   appointed to all men once to die." There is a statute law in the case,
   that hath not been repealed, and that admits of no repeal; this lies
   upon the world: in the virtue of that law it is, that death hath
   reigned. As the strength of sin, so the power of death, even of this
   death, is in the law; that is, in the sentence of it, or in the
   commination annexed by way of sanction thereunto. If there were no law
   first, no man should die. And most plain it is, that this same bodily
   death, unto which all are subjected, it must be within the meaning of
   this death. "Death hath passed over all." For,

   First. We find it to be, most expressly, in the sentence itself that
   was laid upon Adam, and as a comment upon the commination, that was at
   first given. The commination was before his fall: "In the day thou
   eatest thereof thou shalt surely die," die the death; the sentence was
   after his fall: and this death is fully enough signified by the
   sentence--"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return." It cannot
   but be meant, as being so expressly mentioned, both in the commination
   and in the sentence. And,

   Secondly. The actual execution shews it to be meant, to be meant as one
   part of the penalty unto which transgressors are adjudged under the
   name of death. For though it be very true, that, abstractly considered,
   it may be looked upon only as a misery, or as a physical evil, yet
   considering, that God hath vouchsafed to govern his reasonable
   creatures, by a law, and according to the tenor of a covenant, he would
   never lay any thing of afflictive evil upon them, which was not legally
   due. He will herein not go above the legal constitution, by laying any
   more than was due by law, though he might go as much below it as he
   would.

   A righteous ruler will never exceed the law in punishing, though he may
   exceed it, without any injury, in shewing favour. And the difference in
   these two cases, is manifest, be cause that these promises of favour,
   make those, to whom such promises are made, creditors, and make the
   promiser a debtor. But in the inflicting of punishments, the person to
   be punished is the debtor, and he that is injured and wronged, being
   the sovereign ruler, is the creditor poenae, which also the common
   phrase signifies, and shews it to be agreeable to the reason of man
   kind, to look upon the ruler as the creditor poenae, and the offender
   as the debtor poenae; to wit, that phrase of Dare paenae. It is the
   person that is to be punished, who gives satisfaction to law and
   justice, and so, thereupon, is said to owe it; and it is the government
   that is the creditor he owes it to.

   There would be, then, no such thing as this bodily death in the world,
   if the violation of the law of God had not made it a debt to divine
   justice, and to the divine government, as the proper wages of sin. God
   will not lay upon man more than is right, (more than is just and due
   according to law,) that he should enter into judgment with God. Job
   xxxiv. 23. Where upon, the execution, (of which all the world hath
   experience from age to age; for we see the world hath been continually
   and actually under death, and we still daily behold death round about
   us,) this actual execution, I say, shews that this must be part of the
   designed penalty signified here by "death."

   And unto this head we may very well refer all those corporeal evils and
   miseries that men in this world are liable to, and lie under, which are
   so many tendencies unto death, or which we may look upon as death
   begun; so much of a man's time as is past over with him, so much death
   hath eaten up: as the heathen moralist expresseth it: Quicquid nostrae
   aestatis retro est mors habet; death hath devoured all that of our age
   which is already past; so that men may be said to have be gun to die as
   soon as they begin to live, which makes it seem congruous enough, or
   less strange, that Ecclesiastes the preacher, speaking of the events or
   purposes for which there is a season, unto every one a time, he speaks
   of a time to be horn, and a time to die, without any mention of the
   intervening time of life: and fitly enough, or it is not strange,
   because, indeed, men do begin to die as soon as they begin to live.

   Death is wrought with the very primordia of our sensitive nature; so
   that well might that prince say, upon the loss of his son; Novi me
   genuisse mortalem; I begot him and mortality in him, both together. I
   begot him a mortal thing. Death is working in us. (as the apostle's
   phrase is,) all our days, all our time, between our birth and the
   grave, still working in us. And so the longer any man lives in this
   world, he is hut so much the longer a dying. Death did for a great
   while work more gradually and slowly, where a man's life extended to
   some hundreds of years. It hath since come to work a quicker dispatch
   with men; but still they are dying, tending towards the grave, even
   from their first entrance into the world; and this is part of what is
   signified by death here. But yet it is, in comparison, but a small
   part, though it be a real one, a true part. Therefore,

   [2.] Spiritual death is, without doubt, more principally in tended, as
   it is in itself a far more principal evil; that is, all those miseries
   which do now in this present state infest the spirits of men. Arid this
   needs a little more to be insisted on. Herein, therefore, I intend (as
   God shall enable) these two things: first, to shew you that such
   spiritual evils as these, are very fitly comprehended as part of the
   penalty under the name of death; and then, secondly, I shall shew you,
   what this death doth comprehend in it; namely, spiritual death.

   First. That the spiritual evils to which the souls of men are generally
   subject, are very fitly comprehended under the name of death here. That
   death that is said to have passed over all." is a real and great part,
   even the more principal part of the penalty under which they lie: and
   this doth need some explication, the rather for this, that this
   spiritual death is in itself a sinful evil, and, therefore, that it
   should be a punitive one, may seem strange to some. I shall explain the
   whole matter to you, therefore, in some distinct heads and particulars.
   As,

   i. We are to consider, that though sin be principally an injurious evil
   against God, yet it is also by consequence, and collaterally, a
   mischievous evil to the sinner. And thereupon are we said to be "dead
   in trespasses and sins." Ephes. ii. 1. Death is certainly a horrid and
   afflicting evil to him that must suffer it. But such a death as this,
   to wit, to be dead in sin, it is primarily an injurious evil against
   God. For we are to consider what sin is. It is a transgression of the
   law; therefore, considered in strict propriety, it must be chiefly and
   principally against the Law-Maker, a transgression against him that
   made the law; to wit, as a wrong to him. But yet, for all that, it is a
   hurt to ourselves. It lies both against the Object and the subject.
   Against the Object: "Against thee, thee only have I sinned," have I
   offended. It works upward even against heaven: but that, it cannot
   reach to do any real hurt there; but a wrong is done against heaven. "I
   have sinned against heaven and in thy sight." But then it works
   downward so as to hurt and do mischief; that is, as it works in its
   subject, corrodes, and envenoms, and poisons that, and so carries a
   self-punishing malignity in it. "Thine own wickedness shall correct
   thee." Again,

   ii. Consider, for the clearing of this matter, that that life unto
   which this death is opposite (as it is in us, or as it is in an
   intelligent subject) is, both a principle of action, and perception. I
   pray mark this, for it is obvious in the meaning of it to every one's
   understanding and experience. By that life that we generally live, we
   are enabled to act what we do act, and we are enabled to enjoy what we
   do enjoy. It is both a motive and active; and it is both a perceptive
   and a fruitive principle. Now consider this life, as it is an active
   principle, so it makes us the subjects of duty, of all duty which we
   owe to him who made us, and gave us breath and being: but as it is also
   a perceptive and fruitive principle, so it makes us capable of enjoying
   what is good for ourselves. And, again,

   iii. This being plain in itself, we are to consider, that both our
   duty, which we owe to God, and out felicity, which we enjoy in
   ourselves, they are substantially and radically the same thing, and do
   only differ in distinguishing respects; they meet in one and the same
   root, and which is the principal thing in the moral life, (that life we
   are now speaking of; and it is death in the moral sense, and not in the
   natural sense, that we are now speaking of too; for in the natural
   sense, the soul cannot die,) I say, that moral life doth carry, as the
   principal thing in it, both our duty and our felicity, in the same
   common root; to wit, love to God; that is, both radically and
   virtually, all our duty, and all our felicity too. And it is the main
   thing to be considered in moral and spiritual life.

   The love of God, I say, comprehends both these in it. It comprehends
   duty; "If ye love me, keep my commandments." We can never do that which
   he will interpret obedience, but from a principle of love. It is no
   obedience to him, if it do not proceed from love. And, again, the same
   love, our love to God, is that by which we enjoy him, as well as that
   by which we obey him. We can enjoy what we love; but what we love not,
   we can never enjoy. And so that life to which this death stands
   opposed, carries in it that one principle of love, which sums up our
   duty and our felicity both together, and is radically both of them;
   upon which account they are in substance the same thing.

   But they differ only in the different respects that love hath, as it
   respects God, the Ruler of all this world, (and so whom we ought to
   obey and be subject to as our Ruler,) so this love is the principle of
   duty: but then, as it respects ourselves, so it is the principle of
   enjoyment; that is, it eyes God, pitches and terminates upon him, but
   with a reference to ourselves. And,

   iv. These acts, proceeding from this principle of love, which have a
   more direct tendency unto God, do yet involve and carry in them a
   gainfulness and gratefulness to ourselves, so as that our felicity and
   duty will still be complicated in those consequential acts. As, for
   instance, where our felicity is most complete in the heavenly state,
   the eternal adoration of God, which is the immediate and perpetual
   product of the highest and most perfect love to him, it cannot but
   infer perpetual pleasure to them that do so adore. And though that act
   be carried directly towards God, yet it infers a delight, a pleasure,
   (as it cannot but do,) to perfectly right minds, to them who are
   everlastingly so employed and taken up. And I can apprehend nothing
   higher than that, in the pleasure of the heavenly state; to wit, the
   felt congruity of everlasting worship, the soul apprehending and
   feeling within itself, and relishing, with delight, its own act in
   adoring and worshipping God for ever, and finding how congruous a thing
   it is, how comely a thing. And so that which is a right to God, is also
   a satisfaction and delight to the soul itself, that renders it, and is
   continually paying that homage.

   And again, too, in this our present state, wherein felicity can be but
   begun; and if you look to the very beginning of that, the first turn of
   the soul towards God by repentance which enters it into a holy and
   happy state. It is called "repentance towards God," it directly
   terminates upon him; but when once it comes to be true, genuine,
   evangelical, vital, even that itself cannot but carry a sweetness and
   pleasure in it to the penitent soul. For it is not a forced thing, but
   an act that flows freely from a vital, connatural principle, the soul
   pleaseth itself, in abasing itself, in humbling itself, before him; in
   pouring out itself in free confessions and acknowledgments to him. And
   then, consider further,

   v. That for such acts as do more directly respect ourselves, they do
   involve and carry still in them, homage and duty to God too, though
   they do more directly respect ourselves: as trust and joy in God, they
   have a manifest reference to our own safety, and a direct reference
   thereunto. By trust in him, it is, that we secure ourselves, and, by
   which, we become safe from wrath and ruin. Joy, or delight in God, it
   is that by which we entertain, and receive into our own souls, positive
   good, by which we are to be happy and satisfied. As by the other,
   (trust,) we decline and avoid the evil by which we were otherwise, to
   have been miserable, these have a direct reference to ourselves; but,
   they have a consequential reference, too, unto God, or, a conjunct
   reference, as carrying in them, a homage to him, while, at the same
   time, they carry in them, an advantage to us.

   For we cannot render to God higher homage than that trust. It is vital
   trust, by which the soul unites with him, comes into union, enters into
   a state of union with him. By that trust, we give him the highest glory
   creatures are capable of giving him; we, thereupon, acknowledge him to
   be the First Truth. We give him the glory of that great attribute of
   his faithfulness; we acknowledge him to be a God that cannot lie, with
   whose nature it is inconsistent not to be true; we honour him, and
   advantage ourselves, at once, in that very act. And so, delight and joy
   in him, there the case is the same: it is we that are satisfied by our
   delight in God; but it is God that is glorified: for thereby we
   acknowledge him to be an all-sufficient Good, an all-comprehending
   Good, when our souls do centre and rest in him as such; which is the
   true notion of delight; Quies appetitus in appetibile, the rest of the
   desiring faculties in the object desired: it is the rest of our love:
   that by which our love doth move towards its object, till it attain and
   possess it. And then,

   vi. It is hereupon, most plain, that the death which is opposite to
   this life, (that I have so far opened to you,) while it is an injury to
   God, it is also a hurt to ourselves: for the same reason that life doth
   involve these two things in it, even in all the several acts of it; by
   the same reason, it must needs be so, on the opposite hand; to wit,
   that death must comprehend in it, opposite things; and that the same
   evils that are sinful against God, cannot but be hurtful, and
   pernicious, and mischievous to ourselves. And,

   vii. Those evils, that are so said to be signified by this name, are
   very fitly signified by it, very aptly: for, though such a death of the
   soul be not death in the absolute sense; for, if it were death in the
   absolute sense, then would the soul be said naturally to die, which
   would not consist with the doctrine of its immortality; but, it is
   death, in a respective sense only;--yet it is, however, properly,
   death, inasmuch as that respective sense must needs mean the principal
   respect, that such a thing is capable, or can any way admit of; to wit,
   a respect to the end. A respect to the end is always the most principal
   respect of any thing whatsoever, though it be clothed with various
   respects besides its own simple nature: its respect that it bears
   towards its proper adequate end, is always to be reckoned its principal
   respect. Now, look upon man, principally as to his soul or spirit,
   (which is the subject of our present discourse, and the subject of this
   death, which we are now speaking of, spiritual death,) and it is to be
   considered this is a created being. He that made it, made it for
   somewhat. What is the end of such a being as the spirit of man? What
   was it made for? It is a mind, an intellective thing, an intelligent
   being, unto which belongs the power of thought, and that of vast
   compass, extending to multitudes, even to all sorts of objects, and to
   the very highest of all objects; for, God hath made us capable, even of
   thinking of himself, of having an idea of him, a notion of him, which
   all have, more or less, in their minds; now it is to be considered, I
   say, What hath God made such a creature as this for? This mind, or
   spirit of man? Why, principally to converse with himself. For he hath
   made all things for himself; and the spirit of man, more immediately
   for himself, as, he is said, to have fashioned the spirit of man within
   him. That must be, with design, that it should be employed immediately
   upon him, as the principal and most noble End for which it was made:
   but, to this End, it is become useless, the spirit of fallen man,
   apostate man, unconverted man, yet remaining in the state of apostasy,
   not regenerate, not renewed in the spirit of his mind, (the great seat
   and subject of that regenerating work,) it is altogether unapt for the
   end that it was made for, nothing can be plainer.

   Therefore, though it be not simply dead, yet, it is dead quoad hoc, it
   is dead to this purpose, it is dead in this respect; and that is the
   principal respect that such a thing is capable of: for the principal
   respect is, the respect it bears to its end, its great and ultimate
   end, the end that it was made for. Any man that will understand himself
   to be God's creature, especially that he hath a mind and spirit in him,
   that God hath, himself, fashioned immediately, he must needs presently
   apprehend this mind, this spirit, was made for some more principal
   purpose, than only to mind the things of this earth, than only to serve
   a brutal flesh for a few days, that must, at last, rot in the dust: no
   man, that communes with himself, and considers his own nature, that
   hath such a thing as a mind and spirit about him, but must presently
   apprehend, "Sure this mind and spirit of mine, which is impressed with
   the natural image of God, and, which, immediately proceeds from him,
   (who is, therefore, called the Father of spirits,) must be made
   principally to converse with him, to employ itself principally upon
   him, by acts of love, and trust, and adoration, and subjection, and the
   like."

   But, most plain it is, that the spirits of men are become altogether
   inhabile, unapt, to serve this end, for which they are made, and, so,
   are truly said to be dead in this respect; that is, dead to the
   principal use and end for which such a being is said to be made. And,
   therefore, when once the great regenerating turn, and change, comes to
   be made upon the souls of men, this is the effect of it,--they are
   "dead to sin, but alive to God, through Jesus Christ," as Rom. vi. 11.
   intimating, that before, they were only alive to sin, but dead towards
   God and Christ. And what! Do we think that God ever made an intelligent
   and immortal mind and spirit, only to live to sin? they are only alive
   to sin before; but, when this change comes to be made, then, they are
   alive to God: before, quite dead to God; and, so they are dead, in
   reference to their principal end, and the proper design of their
   creation, that they were made for.

   And so, it is a death in equivalence, it is an equivalent death; it is
   the same thing in reference to the end they were made for, as if they
   were not. As if we speak of a human maker of any thing: if an artist
   have made such a thing as a clock or watch, he considers the end of it,
   that which it is to serve for; it is to measure time, to let me know
   the hour of the day, as it passeth. Why, suppose such an instrument as
   this made, and elaborated by a curious hand: What hath this in it? it
   hath in it motion, and the regularity of that motion. Motion alone
   would not make it serve this end, if that motion had not a regularity
   belonging to it. There is, in that instrument, (a watch,) such a thing
   as a balance, wheels that regulate that motion; so as that it shall not
   move at random: if it move at random, the design is lost, the use of it
   frustrated, though it should retain motion, and there were still a
   motive power in it: if its motion were nothing else but an uncertain
   hurry, you could never know how the time passeth by it. And, therefore,
   it were all one, though the thing remain, and though the motion remain;
   it were, I say all one in reference to its end, as if there were no
   such thing, or as if it had no motion at all;

   Take the needle of a compass--it has a mobility, it is put in such a
   posture as it may be easily moveable; but then, with all, it hath a
   verticity, that is, an aptness to turn and stand directly towards the
   north. If it retained never so much its mobility, and loseth its
   verticity, it serves not its end, it is unuseful so, and useless, as
   the needle of a compass; and it were all one as if it were not.

   Suppose these instruments, that are mechanical, were someway vital;
   suppose a watch were a vital thing, and its motion vital; as it is but
   mechanical, when it hath lost all kind of the regularity of the motion,
   the motion itself remaining, it were all one as if it were dead; if it
   had been a living thing, it would no more serve its purpose now, than
   as if it were dead.

   And so it is with reference to the spirits of men: if they do not serve
   the principal design for which they were made, then it is all one as if
   they were dead. God may say of them, "I have no more service from them
   than if they were dead, no more of love, no more of adoration, no more
   of dutiful observance are paid me by them, than as if there were no
   such things." It is to be considered, therefore, that that which makes
   the name of death, in this case, proper, is, that that life that doth
   remain to the spirits of men, that is, by which they live naturally, it
   no more serves the end and purpose for which such a mind and spirit
   were created and made, than if such a thing were quite extinct, and
   there were no such thing. And, thereupon,

   viii. Though this, in itself, be a sinful thing, as an offence to God,
   it is never a whit the less a punishing thing to them that do offend, a
   punishment upon them, that is, they are left to punish themselves,
   because that they do injure God by that violation which they have made
   even of their own frame and natures: and, so the same thing may very
   well be a sin, and a punishment too. And it is most reasonably so: for,
   do but consider the parity of the case, to what is obvious to our
   notice in human governments. If a man be a self-murderer, a felo de se;
   this is the very case, as a man cannot be dead in trespasses and sins,
   (sin being his own act,) but lie must be a self-destroyer. In human
   governments, he that doth destroy himself, it is very true, he suffers
   this evil first, immediately, directly; he is the person that is
   killed, and hath lost his life; but here is, in the mean time, a wrong
   done to the prince, a wrong done to the community; the prince hath lost
   a subject, the community hath lost a member; and this is the case with
   every self-destroying sinner, in reference to God. And, he is liable
   thus to be impleaded: "Thou hast destroyed my creature." This interest
   of God, in all, is superior to any interest we have in ourselves: and
   this the sinner is to be accountable for. "Why hast thou undone my
   creature? Why hast thou made my creature a miserable creature, that was
   capable of being a happy one?" Yea, the whole heavenly community have a
   just plea against any such one that perisheth, and so is eternally cut
   off from them by his own iniquity. "Duly, and by original right, you
   ought to have been a partaker with us; you ought to have been of our
   chorus, in worshipping, adoring; in loving and enjoying God eternally.
   But, you have cut yourselves off from God, and us." Therefore, it is
   lib strange thing that this same death which carries in it the greatest
   hurt and mischief that we are capable of suffering in ourselves, should
   yet be also complicated with sin, as it is an offence against God, and
   an offence against the rest of his creatures,--especially those of the
   sinner's own order in the creation. So fitly is all that doth concern
   us, the whole of man, summed up in the fearing of God, and keeping of
   his commandments, as in that 12 of Ecclesiastes. This is the whole of
   man; the fear of God is nothing else but reverential love, carries love
   in it; that is the principle from whence we keep the commandments of
   God; these commandments are all summed up in love to God, and love to
   ourselves, and to our neighbours as ourselves. Where sin, therefore,
   comes to obtain, and take place, and be in power, there must be, at the
   same time, an injury done to God, an injury done to ourselves, and an
   injury done to the whole community to which we belong; so as that
   death, even spiritual death, is nothing the less capable of being
   intended here as a penalty and punishment, for that it is also
   complicated with sin: for, in the very nature of the thing, it cannot
   but be so, even in the very nature of the things themselves.

   More is yet to be said in reference to what we further promised to
   shew, that this is a real part of the penalty here meant, by the name
   of death, spiritual death, as it is the hurt and evil that does
   mischief to ourselves, to our own souls, to shew that it must lie in
   the compass of that penalty, which, under the name of death is here
   said to pass over all. And then, for the extent and comprehension of
   that, the several things that this spiritual death doth involve in it,
   that we are to speak of afterwards. But, in the mean time, from what
   hath been hinted of these two things--corporeal death, and spiritual
   death, it should entertain our thoughts with, and a little fix them
   upon the prospect we have before our eyes. Now, by way of Use,

   1. It is a doleful state that this world lies under, as it lies under
   that which is fitly to be called death; men, in a continual succession,
   lately sprung up here in this world, swept away presently from it,
   sooner or later, but soon all; one generation coming, and another
   going, but the earth abides. For persons that are capable of using
   thoughts, to behold themselves in this plight, and to look round about
   them, and to behold this to be the common case; "Here we are, lately
   sprung up into being in this world, and we know we are to stay but a
   little while: Dust we are, and unto dust we shall return." A most
   melancholy theme for a man's thoughts, if he have not some what beyond
   all this, to support his spirit, and to afford light, and lustre, and
   sweetness, and pleasure, to it; "life and immortality brought to light
   in the gospel" of Christ.

   Alas! it is strange, amazing stupidity that is upon the spirits of men,
   that this common case is so commonly slighted and made so little of. If
   death did make quicker dispatches, (though we are certain of it, it can
   make no surer, for it reaches to every one sooner or later, but if it
   did make quicker dispatches,) it would set towns and countries
   presently upon a lament, upon bemoaning themselves, and put them into a
   panic, dread and fear. If the plague were (as sometimes it hath been in
   this city, sweeping away thousands in a week) in what a consternation
   would the minds of men generally be? You cannot have forgot, (many of
   you,) how it was. But let this matter be rationally considered, and
   whether it be so many thousands, or so many hundreds, it is the same;
   persons are still mortal, and must as certainly die; it is, therefore,
   an irrational stupidity to be so little apprehensive of this.

   When the plague came upon the people of Israel, (in that of Numbers,
   36.) see what an outcry is raised among them! "Behold we die, we all
   die. How are we consumed with dying!" What a fright were they in! And
   yet, this case is no way different at all from the common case of all
   mortals, more than only this--dying a little sooner, or dying more
   together, more numerously. It is strange there should be a dying world
   always in view, and we should find death working in us, and yet we live
   so unmindful of it from day to day, and are so little apprehensive,
   that, in this respect, death hath passed, and is passing, over all. We
   do not speak to one another at such a time as this; we do not hear; we
   do not look upon one another's faces as so many mortal creatures; sure
   there is not an apprehension suitable to the state of such a case, in
   this respect, that we are all subject to corporeal death. And then,

   2. For the other part of our prospect, sure we should stay a little
   upon it, in our deepest reflections; that is, thus, in sum, that the
   soul of an unregenerate man is a most miserable creature; dead, dead to
   the principal purposes for which such life was given, any such creature
   made. It were as good never to have lived; better, (upon many accounts
   better,) to have been an untimely birth, and never have seen the sun,
   than not to live to God; than to have a total indisposition in my soul
   towards him, to think of him, to love him, to delight in him, to make
   him my life and my all. This is strange, that it should be the common
   case, and so little understood, and so little considered, so little
   taken to heart. O! the restless thoughts that would continually possess
   such a breast, if the matter were but understood, till the regenerating
   work come to obtain, and take place: "I am one that lives to as little
   purpose, as if I had never lived; as if no such creature had ever
   been."

   As if we should consider the matter in reference to an inferior thing,
   belonging to our nature, to wit, the power of speech. Suppose a man
   should retain the power of speech, but hath quite lost his reason,
   which should govern his speech, so that he can speak still, but to no
   purpose; the use of speech were lost; for the design of speech was to
   convey the sense of one man's mind to another; but, when the reason is
   gone, which should form that sense in the man's mind, speech serves for
   nothing. It is just so with the souls of men, in reference to the
   principal end and purpose for which God hath made such a creature. They
   can think, they have a power of thought be longing to them, but to no
   purpose: thought is internal speech, the speech of the mind within
   itself; there they can speak; that is, they can form thoughts, connect
   thoughts, but all to no purpose: for religion, that which should govern
   the motion of the mind, that, is wanting, there is no such thing; this
   makes the soul of man a most miserable thing: it can move, it hath a
   principle of motion in it, which is essential to it; but it hath no
   principle of rest, no inclination towards God, the true rest of the
   soul. Do but illustrate that to yourselves, by the case of a bodily
   motion. Suppose your bodies had the power of bodily motion in them,
   without the power of rest: O! what a miserable thing were man, in
   respect of his bodily frame and constitution! to be in an everlasting
   hurry: he can move, and he must move, perpetually; but he cannot
   sistere se, cannot stop his motion, he can never take any rest. It is
   just so with the unregenerate soul. God is the true rest of the soul.
   It is in perpetual motion, in continual desires, in everlasting
   cravings; but hath nothing by which it can satisfy itself. It never
   comes into its mind, "Return unto thy rest, O my soul." Such a
   creature, one would think, made for torment, that can everlastingly
   move, must be perpetually in motion, but can never rest, can never take
   up any rest in any thing that is agreeable and suitable to it, that can
   satisfy it.

LECTURE XXIX. [44]

   It remains now, in the next place, to shew,

   Secondly: What those several evils and miseries are: and, so, what the
   spiritual death that is now upon the world, and hath passed over all,
   doth comprehend, and contain in it. It comprehends,

   i. The loss of God. A mighty thing! the very thought whereof might set
   all our souls a trembling; and that, whether we consider it as our
   present case, or, as having been our case. The loss of God two ways:
   first, as men have lost all their interest in him; and, secondly, as
   they have lost all inclinations towards him. A loss, that stands at
   once in God's aversion from them, and their aversion from God. A mutual
   aversion between God and them. But, because that, in every thing that
   belongs to our misery, we are first, as in every thing that belongs to
   our felicity, God is first, it is more proper to consider,

   (i.) Our aversion from God, or, men's having lost God, through their
   own disinclination towards him: this is represented as the common case
   of the unconverted, or yet apostate world of men, yet remaining in the
   state of apostasy, that they are atheists in the world. Ephes. ii. 12.
   "Without God in the world;" so we truly enough render it. "Alienated
   from the life of God:" Ephes. iv. 18. Alienated from the divine life,
   from a life of commerce with God they are strangers to God, as men of
   another country: that is the significancy of the expression; so they
   carry it to God, (as it is else where expressed,) like foreigners. He
   is none of our country; we are not of that country of which he is; we
   have nothing to do with him. At that rate men live, and bear
   themselves, generally, towards God.

   And this aversion of the souls of men from God, is total, of the whole
   soul; the mind, the judgment, the will, the affections, they are all
   wholly off from God. So that, when he looks down from heaven upon the
   children of men, to see who will inquire, who will seek after God; lo i
   they are all gone back; (all in a revolt, all flying away from him, to
   the utmost distance that they can;) there is none that doeth good, (not
   this good, it must be specially meant,) no, not one: as in the xiv.,
   and liii. psalms, which are both to the same purpose; as divers
   passages quoted from them, in the iii. of Romans. They are without God,
   and very well pleased with themselves that they are so. They know him
   not, and they all affect not to know him. They are "alienated from the
   life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, and the blindness
   of their hearts." That blindness of heart is a voluntary blindness;
   they are blind towards God, because they will not be hold him, nor take
   notice of his majesty, though his hand be lifted up, though the
   appearance of him be never so bright and glorious. They forget him, he
   is not in all their thoughts. It is the usual character of a wicked,
   unconverted man, that he forgets God: "The wicked shall be turned into
   hell, and all the people that forget God;" the one expression being
   exigetical, or expository of the other. Psalm ix. 16. They refuse him,
   they are unwilling of him. If persons do remain in an unconverted
   state, though related to him as Israel was, (for yet, of them, it is
   said, "Israel would none of me.") Psalm lxxxxi. 11. "My people would
   not hearken to my voice, Israel would none of me.") they will not God.
   We will not have him to be our God. It is a disaffecting of him; the
   affections that should be placed on him are quite off: in the room of
   pious affections, there is nothing else but enmity: "The carnal mind is
   enmity against God."

   And, touching this aversion from God, it was formerly intimated, that,
   as love doth comprehend together, (as the radical virtual principle,)
   all our duty, and all our felicity; so doth this aversion from God,
   (which stands in opposition thereto,) all sin, and all misery. That
   this aversion is the radical principle of all sin; we spake to that
   formerly; and so we, must understand it now, as it is the radical
   principle of misery, God being to be considered by us, under a two fold
   notion--as he is to be obeyed, and as he is to be enjoyed; as the
   Sovereign Authority, and as he is the Sovereign Good. It is the
   aversion from God, as he is the Sovereign Good, that we are now to
   consider, having, under the former head, of the sinfulness of man,
   spoken of it as an aversion to him under the notion of the Supreme
   Ruler, and, as the Highest Authority. But, yet, we have also told you,
   that there is a complication of these things with one another: for men
   do really sin against God in their declining the enjoyment of him, in
   their declining him as their best and highest Good; the constitution of
   the divine laws being such, that there are obligations upon us to be
   happy. So that, a man cannot but be miserable, as he cannot be happy
   without obeying him, even in his very enjoying of the best and highest
   Good, because God hath made this our duty, to place our supreme delight
   in him.

   And so, God hath a just ground upon which to implead the ungodly,
   wicked world; for that, thereby, they make themselves miserable: "Why
   have you thus used my creatures, the souls that I have made? Why have
   you cut and torn them off from me, they which are the works of my
   hands? Why have you used and dealt with them so?" As was told you, he
   that is felo de se, is criminal by human constitution; for though he
   thereby doth afflict himself, destroy himself, yet he doth also injure
   the prince, and injure the community to which he belongs: for he
   destroys a subject and member of the commonwealth. And those who, by
   the law of their creation, should have joined with the rest of the
   creatures of their own order, in the eternal adoration and praises of
   God, have by sin, as much as in them lay, defrauded him, and maimed the
   community unto which they did originally and naturally appertain. But
   then, this misery, as it stands in the loss of God, includes, too,

   (ii.) His just and righteous aversion from them. "God is not a God that
   takes pleasure in wickedness, neither can evil dwell with him." There
   can be no fellowship between light and darkness, between righteousness
   and unrighteousness. He did owe it to himself, to retire from an
   apostate, rebellious world: it was but to do himself right, to express
   a just detestation of the wickedness of a lapsed, degenerate world; to
   hide himself, to withhold his light and grace, which were shut up from
   men by the bar of an everlasting curse, till such time as that should
   be counter-wrought, in reference to any; Christ having been made" a
   curse for us, upon that account, that the blessing might come upon us,
   even us, Gentiles, as it did before upon the Jews, those of them that
   did belong to the election of grace; thereupon it is called "the
   blessing of Abraham;" that that might become a more diffusive thing, to
   reach the Gentiles too; to wit, receiving the Spirit, the promised
   Spirit, through faith. Gal. iii. 13, 14. Therefore, where this curse is
   not removed, it still lies as a bar against all gracious communications
   of light and influence from God to men. And so he is righteously averse
   from them, as they were most unrighteously averse to him: and thus they
   have lost God.

   O! the lamentations that this world would he filled with every where,
   if this case were but understood! What girding with sackcloth would
   there be all the world over! God is gone! God is departed! This would
   be the common cry in town and country, in all parts and places--God is
   departed: that is the amazing thing! Heaven would resound with shrieks
   and cries from the miserable inhabitants of this earth. But, I say,
   that is the amazing thing, (as there will be occasion to take notice
   hereafter,) that such a matter as this is so patiently borne, so little
   resented; that men can so quietly wear away their days here in this
   world, without God, and think themselves to stand in no need of him.
   They can rise in the morning without God; and walkabout all the day
   long without God; and lie down at night without God: and yet, all is
   well.

   ii. This spiritual misery contains in it, too, a wretched conversion of
   soul to the creature. Where God is lost, they design to repair that
   loss. And O! the miserable case of the inhabitants of this world upon
   this account; that they can think or imagine, when they want God, that
   any thing can fill up his room, and be to them instead of him! that it
   doth not come into their minds to consider, "How shall we recover God
   again?" But, "How shall we repair our loss another way?" imagining that
   something or other can be found, and may serve them, and be to them,
   instead of God! that is, that he, (in comparison of whom the whole
   creation is but "as the drop of a bucket, and the dust of the balance,
   lighter than nothing, and vanity itself,") that he can, (I say,) have
   his equivalent; that there may be somewhat found out of equivalent
   advantage and use to them. This is the highest reproach to the Deity,
   as it is the greatest misery to themselves, and both comprehended in
   one thought; to wit, that there may be an equivalent to make up the
   loss of God; that very thought, I say, carries in it the highest
   blasphemy against the Deity, to think that any thing can till up his
   room, and be as good as he is; as well as the greatest misery unto
   wretched souls themselves, that they should be under so fearful and
   pernicious a mistake.

   But this is the common case when God is gone, and men are gone off from
   him, then they turn themselves to the creature: "Let us make the best
   of that we can." So is the project laid all the world over. Not, Let us
   consider how we may regain Cod; how we may get God back again to us;
   but, How we may supply his absence out of inferior things: and this is
   the general posture of mankind. Look on them, and, in reference to God,
   they are in an averse posture; in reference to the creature, in a
   propense posture.

   And what sort of creatures? That we may understand this to go somewhat
   towards the consummating of the state of misery man is fallen into, do
   but consider, I say, what is the kind of that good which they design
   for themselves, when God is no longer eyed by them as the Good that
   they should enjoy, and design for. And consider, too, in what
   circumstances they may expect to have what enjoyments they can have of
   that substituted good.

   For the kind of it, we are to consider in the vast universe of
   creatures, what it is that the apostate world do seek to repair this
   loss of God to themselves out of. It is not out of the nobler parts of
   the creation; they do not look as high as the heavens, they are too
   remote: they are not the angelic beings, that their thoughts fly upon,
   with any design of repairing the loss from among them. But the whole
   bent of their soul is directed towards this lower world, and sensible
   things, things meaner than themselves, meaner than their own minds.
   They think an intelligent, immortal mind must have its enjoyments, even
   unto felicity, in things of so vastly inferior dignity to a mind and
   spirit; that these minds are to be fed upon earth, upon ashes, upon the
   basest and most despicable things within the creation of God! What a
   misery is that! Unto such things it is that all this world is turned,
   being turned off from God, sensible things, earthly things, things that
   can please appetite, things common to them with the beasts that perish,
   only they have ways and arts to refine them, but they are of the same
   nature. As clay will be but clay still, be it figured never so
   curiously. "They mind earthly things;" this is the character of the
   insincere, those that are afar off from God, not turned to him; they
   mind earthly things; their whole souls are let out upon that which is,
   in itself, vain, and a lie; that is, which promiseth fair, but never
   makes good, and so lies to them.

   And consider, under what circumstances men apply themselves to enjoy
   the things by which they would repair to themselves the loss of God:
   especially consider these two most important circumstances: that is,
   that they are things that lie, first, under an interdict; and,
   secondly, under a curse, in reference to them, and, in reference to
   what they design, and seek to themselves by them; to wit, a felicity;
   or with respect to the notion under which they do covet and would enjoy
   them; that is, as their best good, so they lie under an interdict and
   under a curse.

   (i.) Under an interdict: "Love not the world, nor the things of the
   world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
   him." 1 John ii. 5. What a misery is this, that the poor souls,
   revolted and gone off from God, are now universally seeking a felicity
   for themselves in things that, under that notion, lie under an
   interdict, are forbidden to them, and cannot but be forbidden, under
   that notion; because, under that notion, they are made rivals unto the
   Deity. In subordination to God, men might comfortably have enjoyed the
   things of this world; not in competition, nor in opposition: for now
   this world is made his rival, and, therefore, is the love of it
   idolatry, and is the setting up of another God, in opposition to the
   true and living God; and by taking this licence, men think to repair
   themselves for their having lost God. And,

   (ii.) They are things that He, not only under an interdict, but under a
   curse, a malediction,--apostate souls, gone from God, they can have no
   enjoyment of this world, but under a curse, nothing is blest to them;
   they can have no blessed enjoyment of them, or any thing they
   enjoy;--for sin turns all into gall and wormwood, bitterness and death.
   How dismal is the case with fallen man, upon this account! "Cursed in
   the basket, and cursed in the store; cursed in the city, and cursed in
   the field; cursed in the coming in, and cursed in the going out;" as
   the matter is largely and most emphatically represented in the
   xxviii.th of Deut. A people, though related to God, when they go off
   from him; and so put themselves into the common state with the rest of
   the pagan world; a curse lies upon them, in every thing that they do,
   in every thing that they enjoy, they perpetually live under a curse. It
   is with strange rhetoric that this matter is represented in the cix.
   psalm: a curse that they are girt with perpetually, and that is as a
   garment that they are clothed with, and that flows or insinuates itself
   as oil into their bones, and as water into their bowels. So, they are
   under a divine curse, in reference to every thing that they enjoy. And
   that is a second part of this misery which fallen man lies under, even
   in reference to his spirit; to wit, that that is off from God, and is
   turned to a vain world, which is to him an interdicted and an accursed
   thing.

   iii. This misery further includes in it, a continual unsatisfactoriness
   with whatsoever they do or can enjoy. And, as the essence of
   blessedness and felicity doth lie in satisfaction; so, on the other
   hand, must misery consist in continual unsatisfiedness, which results
   from these two things together; first, perpetual craving desires, and
   secondly, the want of any suitable and adequate object by which they
   may be satisfied.

   (i.) In continual craving desires. And that is the common case with all
   men in the fallen state. Why, they have put themselves into an utter
   impossibility, whilst things are just with them as they are, to be
   happy; and yet they have a desire to be happy all this while, nothing
   being more deeply natural, than these two opposite things; a dread of
   misery, and a desire of felicity: and by how much the larger men's
   desires are, so much the greater is their misery in this case. Desires
   enlarged even as hell, and that could even swallow up a creation and
   more; for a creation was never to satisfy them. It was not a created,
   but an uncreated Good, that was the object designed for the
   satisfaction of the souls of men: "Who will shew us any good?" There is
   the character of an unrenewed mind and spirit, in that psalm, iv. 6.
   But it never comes into their minds to think, what that Good is that
   could be adequate to them. "Lord lift thou up the light of thy
   countenance upon us:" they never think of that, but still cry out, "Who
   will shew us any good?" Roving, uncertain desires, which, with all,
   find that they can meet with nothing that is suitable and adequate for
   the satisfaction of them: these desires must turn to torment, when
   there is not an object for such desires to feed upon; they prey upon
   their subject, turn inward; and, so men's desires are their tormentors,
   and make them miserable, in that they continually desire and crave that
   which they cannot reach. For,

   (ii.) The other thing that concerns, and falls in, to make this a
   miserable case, or to render it a real misery, is, the want of a
   correspondent good for so vast and large an appetite; and that, upon a
   double account: to wit, that what would satisfy them they cannot
   desire; and, that which they do desire, can not satisfy them. That
   which would satisfy, they cannot desire: God would satisfy them, he
   were an adequate, correspondent Good, to the most enlarged desire of
   the soul. Aye, but him they care not for; towards him they have no
   motion: towards him there is nothing but aversion and disinclination
   and disaffection, as you have heard before: so that, as the carnal mind
   cannot please him, so it cannot be pleased with him. And, that which
   they most of all desire, that cannot please them, as you have likewise
   heard.

   And so, in reference thereunto, they lie always in the same restless
   posture. As, I remember, a heathen saith, concerning a soul loose from
   God: (it is the saying of Hierocles:) "That such a soul being loose
   from God, is like a cylinder upon a plain, that can never lie still; it
   is always in perpetual motion." The state of a soul that is off from
   God, is just such, circled all within itself, capable of setting upon
   no basis. There is nothing that can give a firm posture, or a posture
   of rest to it; for all things, beneath it, and beside it, are
   unsuitable, inadequate; and, therefore, nothing can ensue but perpetual
   unsatisfiedness. A miserable case! To have so capacious a thing, as the
   soul of a man is, capable of so high and great enjoyments, and to be
   under continual dissatisfaction, because that which would satisfy, it
   cannot desire; and that which it doth desire, cannot satisfy. And,

   iv. This misery hath this further in it, a continual delusion, which
   the souls of men lie under, in reference to the objects of their
   enjoyment; a being continually imposed upon by the false and delusive
   appearances of things, so as, hereupon, they meet with disappointments,
   both in reference to what they attain, and in reference to what they
   attain not. Herein stands their perpetual delusion; that is, they are
   cheated into the expectation of meeting with that rest and satisfaction
   for themselves, which they can never find, and that, whether they do
   attain the things they seek, or attain them not.

   The case is generally with men, in this respect, as with some weak,
   half-witted persons, who, looking about them here and there, they see
   some rising ground, such or such a hill, or mountain, and they think,
   if they were on the top of that mountain, they should reach heaven, for
   heaven seems to touch that; when, if they should be at the pains to
   travel to the top of that mountain, they should find themselves at the
   same distance they were before. So it is with the men of this world,
   with reference to what they expect from it, of good and rest to
   themselves: "O! I should be in a very heaven, if I were in a condition
   so high." Some men's states and conditions carry their appearance with
   them of very high lofty mountains, that do even over-top heaven, or
   touch heaven. "If I were but so high as such a man, or such a man, I
   were a happy man." Alas! they are deluded and disappointed, both these
   ways: first, that the most can never reach that which they do expect
   and design, in point of worldly advantage; and, secondly, that if they
   do, they are much what they were, as far from felicity as before: nay,
   it may be, sunk by that very means, by which they thought to be raised,
   into deeper misery than before. This is a very dismal, yet, it is the
   common case! Men spend their days, wear away a wretched life-time,
   here, in this world, in pursuit of such an outward good state, or
   condition; and most of them al ways die short of what they designed, of
   what they projected in any such kind. And, if any have compassed this,
   or that great design, or project, for this world; why, they are still,
   when they have compassed it, nothing the nearer. In a like case with
   that great prince, of whom we read, who, discoursing with one of his
   courtiers, about several great designs that he had for this world, told
   him, He would move his arms, against such a country, and such a
   country; and take in such a town, and such a city; "Then," saith the
   courtier, "what will you do after that?" "Why, then I will carry my
   arms such and such a way." "And what then?" "Why, then I will labour to
   accomplish such a thing, after that." "And what then, after that?"
   "Then I will sit still, and be quiet." "Why, sir," saith he, (( you may
   as well do so now." Men might as well now sit still, and be quiet; when
   God hath given them some tolerable competency. And now, let me be
   thinking of, and caring for a soul, and providing for an eternal
   wellbeing. But, men think not of this, but let their lives run to
   waste, in a continual pursuit of shadows, and are in a continual
   delusion, with reference to what they attain, and what they attain not.
   In reference to what they do not attain; for that it would not satisfy;
   and, then, with reference to what they do attain; for they thought they
   should be much better for it, when, it may be, they are much the worse.

LECTURE XXX. [45]

   Our business hath lately been, and still is, to represent the common
   miseries of man, which are all comprehended under the name of "death,"
   very fitly, and very usually, not only in sacred language, but in other
   authors; several particulars have been instanced in. And now, the next
   in order, which I designed to be more largely insisted on, is,

   v. This misery stands in slavery, in that base and ignoble servitude,
   which the generality of men, in the state of apostasy, are subject to:
   a thing which will but slowly enter into the minds of those who have
   not been instructed, and considered well the matter afresh; that is,
   that the generality of men, in their state of apostasy from God, are
   become the meanest, and basest sort of slaves; and, that is fitly
   enough called--"death;" (as I have told you, death must be taken here,
   not formally, but, in a large and comprehensive sense,) men of more
   ingenuous minds, rather choosing death than slavery: as it hath been
   with all those more noble-spirited men, who thought their lives
   laudably sacrificed for the liberty of their country, to redeem it from
   slavery: and, thereby, shewed themselves, that they did scorn to live
   as slaves, with the rest; they thought death a more eligible thing; and
   so, could say as he did dying: (though nothing else was effected.) "I
   have done this one noble thing; that I have chosen to die, rather than
   live as a slave." It is a misery much worse, than that which goes
   commonly among us, under the name of death, to be a slave.

   But, if the matter be narrowly inspected, and looked into, every one
   that understands himself, and what the nature of man is, especially as
   to that part of man, which, more deservedly, bears that name, (the mind
   is the man,) he cannot, upon reflection, but consider the state of
   slavery as the common state,--the life, and strength, and faculties,
   and powers of a reasonable, intelligent mind and spirit, being
   generally subject to things beneath, and below the dignity of their
   nature; this is to be very basely servile. But this is that which they
   will very hardly think to be so, who do consider that they live
   according to their own wills, which, indeed, is the vulgar notion of
   liberty. He is a freeman: Liber est qui vivit vult--He lives as he
   affects to live, as he chooseth to live. Why, sure it cannot be that
   this man chooseth to be a slave.

   But, there cannot be a more mistaken notion than this; or, that will
   more easily (if the matter be considered) prove itself false. For by
   how much the more the will of a man is inclined and led to choose
   things that are mean, and base, and unworthy of a man, so much the
   worse slave he is; when he is cheated into a consent unto that which
   debaseth him, and makes him mean; when he is fraudulently imposed upon,
   against all rational dictates and sentiments. And, undoubtedly, it was
   but that vulgar mistake, (not peculiar to the Jews, but common to
   sinners, as such, unto the world of mankind, yet in a state of
   apostasy, or not recovered out of it,) that our Lord animadverts upon,
   in that 8 John, in several verses, where he is dealing with that
   people, who were his immediate auditors upon this very topic; that is,
   he promiseth them liberty: "If the Son make you free, you shall be free
   indeed." But they tell him, with disdain, "We were never in bondage to
   any man; we are Abraham's seed." He replies upon them, "Whosever
   commits sin, is the servant of sin;" and, being the servant of sin, is
   the slave of the devil too; and so much more miserably, and so much the
   worse he is so, by how much the more naturally, and according to
   inclination, he is so: for, when that is the case, when such appear to
   be the devil's own seed, his off spring, considering themselves not
   naturally, but morally, according to their inclination, with reference
   to the practice of duty, and with reference to consequent or connexed
   felicity; they are so far acted upon by that impure, apostate spirit,
   as that they do appear to be his very progeny, begotten of him. And, so
   is this whole world divided into those two great families the children
   of God, and the children of the devil. "Herein are the children of God,
   and the children of the devil, manifest," as the same apostle, in his
   iii. chapter of his 1st epistle, tells us. And so, our Saviour speaks
   correspondently hereunto, to these, his present hearers, in the 44
   verse of that viii. John: "Ye are of your father, the devil, and the
   works of your father ye will do." And, therefore, is that very suitable
   to this purpose, (which I have taken notice of formerly,) what Austin
   observed out of a heathen moralist: "That it is a far more miserable
   thing to will that which is unjust, than not to obtain that which one
   willeth." It is so in the very reason of the thing. If men could make
   themselves masters of all that they covet, during their abode in this
   lower world; if they could have every thing in their possession and
   power that they cast a fond eye upon, or place an irrational wish upon,
   they were a great deal more miserable, even in being left so to wish,
   so to desire, so ineptly, so foolishly. And, therefore, that kind of
   liberty, which stands only in gratifying inordinate and enormous
   desires, it is no other kind of liberty than that which God threatens
   the Jews with; a liberty to perish; a liberty for the sword, and
   famine, and pestilence: "I thus manumit you; I give you that sort of
   freedom, to run on in those ways, which shall infer upon you the most
   miserable end; that shall lead you into tragedies and death, which way
   so ever you tread your foot, or cast your eyes."

   And, therefore, what a noted author among the pagans saith, concerning
   one particular people, may be said concerning mankind, while they
   remain in the state of apostasy, and, antecedently to their recovery,
   that they are such as, Quos decuit esse servos, a state of servitude is
   so suitable to them, that it befits them to be nothing else but slaves.
   And so much the rather because it is that which they themselves choose.
   And do not think Scripture speaks ineptly, or unsuitably to the case,
   when it bids them that are recovered out of the common misery, that lay
   upon the world, to consider what they were before: "Ye were sometimes
   foolish, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures;" Titus iii. 3.
   It is that which men, recovered to a right mind, would look upon with
   the greatest disdain imaginable; to wit, that a reasonable, intelligent
   spirit should only employ itself, its noble faculties and powers, from
   day to day, in pursuing a design, how to serve and gratify a thing no
   better, or no worthier of a high state and station in the creation of
   God, than a brute creature. Nay, not so worthy; be cause those
   creatures, are what they are by no degeneracy. They were never better,
   never higher: but, if a man be in the condition of a brute, he comes to
   be so by a lapse, by a fall, by a depravation: he is sunk beneath
   himself, he hath lost a good that he, was capable of, and a perfection
   belonging to his own nature, that was the glory thereof; and, this he
   hath exchanged for the basest and vilest sort of slavery. The apostle
   Peter, 2 Epis. ii. 19. tells us, "That while men promise themselves
   liberty, they themselves become servants of corruption;" for, of whom a
   man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage: and to be in
   bondage to corruption, is the vilest kind of servitude that can be
   thought. We can form no idea in our minds of so base a vassalage as
   this,--to be servants to brutal and unreasonable appetitions and
   desires.

   Man being by the constitution of his own nature a reasonable creature,
   to have that very reason of his depressed into a subserviency to what
   is unreasonable, is, in itself, a real misery, whatever the common
   estimate concerning it may be; and whatsoever that is now, undoubtedly
   it will, within a very little while, cease to be what it is. They that
   glory in their fetters, that please themselves in being such slaves, in
   being "led captive by satan at his will," they will shortly, very soon,
   (though not soon enough it may be,) change their minds. It is much to
   be feared that many may not change soon enough; but it will be very
   soon however; for how soon is the life of a man run out? and then the
   vain dream ends in the horror of an awakened soul: then it sees what it
   feels, and what estate it hath, by its own wilful choice, declined, and
   what it did addict itself unto, against the common sentiments and
   dictates which were not alien from them all that while; but only were
   not attended to. They were not at leisure to commune with themselves,
   and to consider what their own thoughts would suggest; and their misery
   is not the less for their having been under mistakes concerning this
   whole business all this while, when that mistake will be so soon
   detected, and they cannot be of that false opinion always. Indeed, we
   might admit, that happiness and misery stood always in opinion, if that
   opinion would always last: but when we are sure it will not, but that
   men will quickly alter their minds, as soon as their course is run out,
   then that will be found to be real misery before, which becomes now to
   be only misery apprehended. But again,

   vi. A further thing wherein this misery lies, even that of men's minds,
   is the continual infatuation under which man, in his state of apostasy,
   is every where: and it is this that betrays him into that slavery which
   we have been now discoursing of. He is a slave, because he is a fool:
   he is fooled into the slavery which he so patiently undergoes. So you
   find these things connected in that Titus iii. 3. "We were sometimes
   foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures."
   And (as I have heretofore had occasion to note) that Greek word which
   we render "foolish," as if it signified only the being without a right
   mind, it signifies more; it signifies being put out of a right mind. It
   is not being without a mind, for so is a stock and a stone, which were
   never capable of any such thing; but that word signifies being
   disminded, or having lost one's mind in the use of it: "I have a mind,
   but I have been never the better for it. I have not known how to employ
   it:" and this comes in immediate connexion with serving divers lusts
   and pleasures; men having been so mean, and so base servants and
   slaves, because they were fools before; foolish, deceived, easily
   suffering themselves to be imposed upon; mocked, shamed into foolish
   expectations of felicity, where there is no such thing: so that in the
   very pursuit they still sink themselves lower and lower in miseries and
   death.

   And hence it is, that that language is so usual in Scripture, of
   signifying a wicked man by the name of "a fool," as nothing is more
   familiar in the whole book of Proverbs, and sundry texts besides. Nor,
   indeed, is that sort of expression peculiar to the Scripture. Nothing
   hath been more usual among some of your more noted pagan moralists,
   than by the name of sapiens, a wise man, to denote a virtuous man, a
   good man. A good man is dignified with the name of a wise man; then
   the" opposite hereto is obvious, that every evil man; every vicious
   man, is a fool: for it is not said of this or that person, more
   signally stupid or wicked, that he hath said in his heart, (as a fool,)
   "There is no God." But that, (as you see in the xiv. and liii. Psalms,
   which are congenerous, and have almost the same passages in the former
   verses of the one and the other,) by that name is meant apostate man,
   in his state of apostasy. And so it is the general character of all
   men, yet remaining in that estate, and antecedently to their reduction
   and recovery out of it: "The fool hath said in his heart," not that
   there is no God, that is not the text, but--"no God," reckoning it to
   be rather the matter of their wish, than their assertion: it is capable
   of being understood in the optative, not in the indicative form; not as
   if they did say, "There is no God;" but "O! that there were none;" the
   fool hath said in his heart, "Would there were no God."

   And who those fools are, you see in what follows: God looks down from
   heaven on the children of men to see if there were any that did good,
   any that did seek after God; but they are all gone out of the way, all
   gone back, all in an universal revolt; none doing this good; to wit,
   not inquiring, not seeking after God, but all agreeing in the same
   wish: "O! that there were none: O! that there were no Ruler, no Lord
   over us; none to concern himself in any of our affairs; none to
   animadvert on our way and course, and to call us to account." Where
   upon, nothing is more manifest than that according to the import of
   this scripture, the universality of apostate mankind lies under this
   character of folly. And somewhat it doth suppose, and somewhat it more
   formally includes. That which it supposeth is ignorance, the want of
   right notions of things: those, men have in their minds, are generally
   false: but somewhat it more formally includes, and that is, the
   inefficacy of those notions which they have. And this is folly more
   formally, and which stands in an immediate connexion with misery, or
   rather, more naturally inclusive of it.

   In reference to things of principal concernment to men, they are not so
   generally ignorant as they are foolish; ignorance consisting in the not
   having of right notions, but folly consisting in the inefficacy of
   those that are right, in opposition to governing wisdom; that practical
   wisdom by which a man must steer his course, and walk agreeably and
   consistently unto that light and knowledge which he hath. And herein
   lies the common prevailing folly of this world; that in things wherein
   men have knowledge, they corrupt themselves, and their "foolish heart
   is darkened," as the expression is, Romans i. 21, upon account whereof
   it is that God doth give them up, for their contending against the
   light and knowledge which they have, unto those brutish sensualities,
   as that they should do things that are not convenient, things very
   disagreeable to the nature of man, to the dignity of a human,
   reasonable creature.

   And so, also, the light which men have, is called "darkness" by
   equivalence; that is, it signifies no more to the proper purpose of
   light, to steer and conduct a man's way and course, than if it were
   real darkness. And so, if you will allow our blessed Lord to be a Judge
   and Master to us of such propriety of speech, you must acknowledge that
   to be a very proper expression, that the light that is in man's
   unconverted mind, is darkness. "If the light that is in thee be
   darkness, how great is that darkness?" Matt. vi. 23. That is, it
   answers no purpose of light, it serves for no such purpose as light is
   designed for, to guide a man in his way: they have such and such
   notions; but they do in their constant course run counter to them: and
   this is not ignorance, hut folly, that they prevaricate with their own
   light, that they should know they ought to do so and so; and so and so
   they ought to choose; but they do choose and do quite the contrary.

   And hence it is (which is the very achme of a man's misery; that is,
   the misery of his mind and spirit) his misery in this respect, that he
   is, by this means, made a bundle of contradictions and inconsistencies.
   And so hath nothing but confusion within him; or is in a continual war
   with himself: and there is no accord, no agreement, between his most
   rational sentiments and resolutions, and his consequent way and course:
   for if a man did sit down and deliberate but in the morning of any day,
   "How ought I to spend this day? ought I to employ it in following the
   inclinations of the man, or of the brute?" Certainly, he would think it
   more worthy of him to act like the man this day, than to employ the
   day, or his thinking, manly powers, only in pursuing the inclination of
   the brute. But then, if in fact he do run counter to any such
   sentiments as these, it is not because he is ignorant, but because he
   plays the fool. He hath not that wisdom that he ought, to govern his
   way, and to act suitably unto the clearest and most rational
   apprehensions of things. And so he is made up of nothing but
   inconsistencies with himself, or incoherencies, which shew him to be a
   miserable creature. For what? Do we think, did God make him such, (with
   such a mind that equals him with the angels of God,) to be employed in
   serving such desires, and pursuing such designs, as puts him below a
   brute?

   vii. And a further thing in this state of misery, is the ignominy that
   men are hereby drawing upon themselves. And there is no man that
   considers, but will acknowledge that just ignominy is a misery,
   ignominy truly and justly so accounted. "Sin (we are told) is the
   reproach of any people." And then it must be as much the reproach of
   any person: as in that Prov. xiv. 24. every one accounts him a
   miserable man who is universally despised by every one, especially by
   the wisest and best of men. And suppose all mankind were, without a
   recovery, in that state of misery together, so that none must be found
   wiser or better than another, that could not at all mend the matter,
   with any of the individuals; as if it were riot misery, because amongst
   men, none thought this to be misery, or none thought it to be truly
   ignominious. For we are to consider that we have other spectators,
   besides men, that are more capable of judging.

   It signifies little to any man, what he thinks of himself, or what
   others think of him, in comparison of what is thought of him, by him
   who is wisdom itself, and whose judgment of things never erreth. It is.
   not what man thinks of himself, or commends himself for, but what the
   Lord commends, that is approved. And our Lord Jesus Christ is
   peculiarly called by the name of "wisdom;" it is his common style and
   character. And we must suppose him greatly to concern himself about the
   affairs of a world, whereof he is the immediate Creator. "All things
   were made by him, and without him was nothing made that was made." And
   therefore, that he hath a continual inspection (if he had not taken the
   Redeemer's part) upon this world. He is said to be "the Image of the
   invisible God, and the first begetter of all creatures," and that fitly
   enough (as that title fitly enough admits to be read) for "by him were
   all things made, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities, or powers."

   And then, we consider ourselves in this lower world under the continual
   view and inspection of those nobler creatures, that are intended by
   those names, they cannot but apprehend our apostasy, and much more the
   continuance of it r to be very ignominious and reproachful unto this
   whole order of creatures, fallen from their rightful Lord, because
   accomplices with the other apostate spirits of their own order, who
   were fallen before. How might it cut and wound a man's heart, to think
   what the resentments of these wise, holy, and kind, and benign
   creatures (the glorious angels of God) are, concerning our common state
   here in this world? we having had the same Author and Parent of our
   being with them; he being "the Father of spirits." An appellation
   equally agreeing to them, and to us, and not more to them than to us.
   To think that a world of such creatures, the progeny and offspring of
   the same Father, (the Father of spirits,) should be fallen to such a
   low pitch of misery and wretchedness, as they generally are; why sure
   they cannot but look upon our state and case to be most miserably
   ignominious and reproachful.

   And therefore, they that continue in the apostasy, and are never
   recovered in this world, when they come to rise from the dead, they are
   said to "rise to shame and everlasting contempt;" Dan. xii. 2. One that
   was an apostate from God, and would never be recovered, he cannot but
   be had in ever lasting contempt. And unto an ingenuous mind, and one
   that God hath recovered to his wits, in some measure, nothing hath a
   sharper pungency upon the mind than shame. And then, to be under
   everlasting shame, everlasting contempt, by those wise and holy
   creatures that were so full of kindness and benignity in their
   complexion towards men, and the spirits of men, upon account of their
   near affinity, being in so great a measure, of one kind and nature with
   us, must be a great misery.

   They that are recovered are called "angels," fellow-associates with
   God. That they should be the devil's fellows, followers of those wicked
   angels that were all in rebellion against their Rightful Sovereign
   Lord; and that, too, when they might have made a better association;
   overtures being made to them for their recovery and return: overtures
   being made to them of the most kind reception, though they were
   prodigals and rebels against their Father; this must leave them under
   ever lasting shame and contempt: and every one looks upon them now
   (that is, every good angel doth) to be infamous, being sunk to so low a
   state of shame and misery; and any wise and good man would scorn to
   keep such a one company, think it a reproach to him to reckon any such
   among his associates: and this will be the common case of apostate
   creatures, even eternally, to wit, such as are not recovered, that is,
   that they are abandoned to shame and everlasting contempt. And their
   own reflection, hereupon, must needs be the most sharp and tormenting
   thing that can be thought, to think what they are, and what they might
   have been, if they had not declined and refused to comply with so apt
   and suitable methods for their recovery. But further,

   viii. It is another ingredient in the misery of the state of man in the
   apostate world, that they have such continual sharp resentments in
   their minds of the external evils that befal them here. They live in a
   world wherein they are continually liable to those evils which do first
   affect their sense; but not only of external evils, they become
   internal and rill their minds and spirits with torment. Herein lies
   much of their misery, they comfort themselves in such and such present,
   enjoyments that are variable, mutable and uncertain, which they have
   this hour, and are gone the next. They have this hour a delightful and
   joyful dwelling, and it is of a sudden, turned into flames. They had
   the other day a rich and plentiful estate; it hath all of a sudden
   taken wings, and is gone. Health turned into wasting sickness; ease
   into tormenting pain, all on a sudden. Ail these are very considerable
   as they terminate in the external sense; but as they enter into the
   mind, so they become inward evils, their minds are continually liable
   to anguish and torment by such events, and upon such accounts. And
   then,

   ix. When it is so, they have no relief from God; for they have not
   before known the way of addressing to him. Good men, in their external
   calamities, have this refuge always ready. David, when he had lost his
   all at Ziklag, yet, comforted himself, in the Lord his God. His wives
   and family were all led captive by the Amalekites; his goods rifled;
   his house and city burnt with fire; that place that was left him for
   retirement, all rendered uninhabitable, on a sudden, by consuming
   flames: the people themselves, (the companions of his flight,) spake of
   stoning him; thus was he in the most deplorable case, that could be:
   "But he encouraged himself, (it is said) in the Lord his God." But men,
   in their apostasy from him, have none of this comfort, none of this
   relief; they have obstructed and shut up the way of address to God
   against their own souls; they know not how to apply themselves to him.

   Such a case as that you have represented, Hab. iii. 17, 18. It was a
   very forlorn and distressed state, and a case, he supposeth, that "the
   fig tree did not blossom; that no fruit was in the vine; the labour of
   the olive did fail; the field did yield no fruit; and the flocks were
   cut oft' from the stall;" nothing but perishings: "yet," saith he, "I
   will rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my salvation." A most
   deplorable case it is, when, amidst whatsoever distresses a man hath,
   he hath no God to betake himself to, nor inclination to be take himself
   to God. Think of the distresses of Saul, (Sam. xxviii. 15.) as there he
   laments his own case: "The Philistines make war against me, and God is
   departed from me, and giveth me no answer;" he could have no relief
   from God. It hath been the privilege of souls, that are returned to
   God, and come back to him, that, when they are cast down under
   affliction, they could apprehend themselves not cast off: "They were in
   tribulation, but not in distress, afflicted, but not forsaken;" as 2
   Cor. iv. 8, 9. But men, in an apostasy from God, have no relief, they
   know not where, nor how to betake themselves: "They cry out because of
   the oppression of the mighty; but none saith, Where is God my Maker?"
   Job xxxv. 10. No, instead of that, they count him an enemy; and, there
   is really too much ground for it, while they persist, and go on in
   their wickedness.

   And, these are heads that might further be insisted on, together with
   that general stupefaction, fitly called "death." or signified by the
   name of death, that possesseth the souls of the most in this present
   state; that, while in the midst of such miseries, they are so
   ingulphed, they feel them not, apprehend them not, or, at least, the
   worst, and most formidable part of that by which they are the most
   miserable:" the anger of the Lord preys upon them, as a consuming fire,
   and they know it not; it hath burnt them, yet they lay it not to
   heart," as the prophet expresseth it, Isaiah xlii. 25. And that,
   indeed, is a most calamitous case, and calls for deep lamentation; the
   inhabitants of this earth, generally, as in the suburbs of hell, (as we
   have no other notion of this world, than as a portal and introduction
   into the eternal state of blessedness, or misery,) and, that men should
   be so near perishing, having wrath to the uttermost coming upon them,
   and yet, so generally unconcerned. This is a like case to that of a
   lethargic body, that may be tossed and rolled hither and thither; you
   may, perhaps, cut it and wound it, but it feels not. As little sensible
   are the minds or spirits of men of this state of their case, of those
   miseries, by which they are now wretchedly miserable, and are in danger
   of being finally and eternally so.

   With what lamentations might we bewail the case of apostate men, upon
   this account, would we but admit the thoughts of the common case to
   enter and sink into our minds and hearts. Men are so strangely
   habituated to misery, that it is now become their element, and natural
   to them: they can see themselves gradually sinking lower and lower into
   death, and, might apprehend, that consummate death was at hand, but
   they are not startled and amazed, no amazing thought has place in the
   minds of men, to awaken them, and make them bethink themselves, while
   it would be seasonable, and while any thing might be done towards their
   escape from the wrath which is to come: but, they remain generally, in
   that dead sleep, which binds up all their powers, and are like so to
   do, (if wonderful mercy prevent not,) till flames awaken them out of
   their pleasant dream. And now, I add, further,

LECTURE XXXI. [46]

   x. The consequent discomposure of the whole frame of man, I mean of the
   inward man, as the apostle distinguisheth of man, making him double, a
   man, and a man; an outward man, and an inward man; 2 Cor. iv. 16. Now
   for this inward man, there is a universal discomposure of the whole
   frame. They that will look upon what we insisted on before, but as a
   reputative evil; to wit, ignominy, must reckon this a most real one;
   that is, that that noble piece of workmanship, the inward man, is so
   marred, and spoiled, and discomposed throughout, and become a far more
   monstrous thing than any dislocations, or transpositions of the parts
   of these bodies of ours, can make them, though it would be easy to
   suppose it possible that men might be, as to the outward man, a most
   monstrous sort of creature, by the mere transposition of parts, yet,
   let any, the most horrid metamorphosis of that kind you can think of be
   supposed, and, it is nothing to that discomposure of the frame of the
   inward man, that is to be found and observed in every, yet apostate son
   of Adam, not converted, not returned to God, out of that state of
   apostasy.

   For, as to what we have insisted on already, (that infatuation that is
   upon the minds of men every where,) consider, what must hereupon be
   consequent; that conductive governing light, that should lead men in
   the whole of their course, it is extinct, it is darkness, as our
   Saviour speaks in Matt. vi. 23. "If the light, that is in thee, be
   darkness, how great is that darkness." It is not said, concerning an
   unregenerate man, that he hath darkness in him; but, that he himself is
   darkness. Eph. v. 8. "Ye were sometimes darkness:" their governing
   light was lost and gone, and then, what must become of the man? What is
   the state and frame of the inward man hereupon? Why you are to
   consider, (that light being supposed,) what was to be under its
   direction and government, in man, to wit, the inward man. There was his
   will, which was to be guided by that directing principle, but it is
   gone. And, there were all the passions of the soul, that were to have
   been moderated thereby, but, that being gone, the will is under no such
   guidance, the passions under no such moderation. What a horrid creature
   is man, hereupon, become, in the complexion of his soul, and inward
   man?

   For his will, that is naturally wont to be called caeca potentia, an
   unseeing faculty; why, admit that it were properly to be so called,
   according to the natural constitution and frame in man, it' was yet to
   be guided by a faculty that could see, by a seeing mind: but now, when
   an unseeing will is to be guided also by an unseeing mind, the blind is
   to lead the blind, (to allude to that of our Saviour,) what will become
   of this, but a being plunged into the ditch? This is the common case
   with man: that will of his, which is the commanding faculty in the soul
   of man, comes to be itself under the conduct of no reason, an
   unreasonable will: O! what a fearful case is this, when, yet, it is
   most manifestly the common case.

   For, do but ask, What is the object of that faculty, that we call the
   will, in man? It is primarily his end, that is the object of it: that
   is, good; for good and end are wont to be taken for convertible terms;
   the means are only good by the goodness of the end. Now, when a man
   wills his end unreasonably, without the ducture or guidance of any
   seeing, discerning principle; and, to think of a man acting
   accordingly, shaping his course accordingly, and, to think of all men
   doing so, what a monstrous deformity is this of that noble creature;
   though it be true, indeed, that many are found to act rationally; that
   is, indeed, wilily and subtilly enough in the pursuit of such and such
   ends that they do design; but, yet, it is plain, they do, universally,
   mistake their end itself, and so the whole life of man can be nothing
   else but a continual error: "They do always err in their hearts, not
   having known my ways." What doth it signify, that a man can pursue such
   and such ends, with courage and dexterity; but these ends themselves,
   either he may gain them, or he may gain them not? Many times he never
   gains them; but, if he doth gain them, they are worth nothing. Why,
   here is a life lost, thrown away by the very complexion of the inward
   man; this he is inclined to do, to take such a course, as by which his
   whole life is lost, and thrown away.

   A thing that that pagan moralist most aptly animadverts upon, when he
   saith, "Men are very shy of destroying their lives all at once, losing
   their lives altogether; but they make no difficulty of losing them all
   by parts:" that is, this day of my life I pursue an end, that is worth
   nothing; and I do so to morrow, and the next day, and so from year to
   year, as long as my life lasts. Here is a life quite thrown away; and a
   man is led to it by the inward complexion and temper of his soul, as he
   hath mis-made himself, misshaped himself; for he was made upright, but
   he would be trying inventions, and this it hath come to. This is plain
   and evident concerning all the world of apostate, unrenewed men; that
   whereas, their will is the commanding, governing principle of their
   lives, it doth command nulla ratione, it universally commands without
   reason, and so must signify as much of misery to a man, as if his eyes
   were out, and he among pits and precipices, where he cannot do so much
   as set a foot, without danger of perishing presently.

   It is plain, the minds of men, as they lie under the direction of such
   a misguided will, they are conducted by no rational principle at all,
   upon this ground, that it is the end which is the principal object of
   every one's will. But they are universally out as to their end, running
   a quite counter-course to what they should, through the whole course of
   their time; so that, in this respect, the apostate, unregenerate man,
   is natus ad miseriam, he is wholly framed unto misery; and to nothing
   else but to misery. It is true, men have generally some practical
   notions of truth, that is, notions of truth about practical matters,
   that should be the principal things. They have gene rally some
   apprehensions of God, some apprehensions of a future state, some
   apprehensions of the immortality of their souls; but these notions are
   too weak and debile, to do the office of principles. They do not do the
   office of principles, in that nobody steers his course, (antecedently
   to regenerating grace,) pursuant to any such principles. And if you
   would reduce the determination of men's wills to any principles at all,
   they can agree to no other principles than such as these; (though they
   should more generally disclaim and disavow them yet they are apt to be
   governed by them, and no other;) that is, that a man is made for
   himself; that he is his own end; that he that hath made him, hath no
   right to rule him; that from him, from whom he hath received his being,
   he is not to expect blessedness; but that he is to seek it in inferior
   things, things inferior to himself; that time is far more considerable
   and valuable than eternity, that mortal flesh is far more valuable than
   the immortal spirit. The actual resolutions and determinations of men's
   wills which do govern their course, and according to which they lead
   their lives, do only square with such principles as these; though, when
   they are made explicit, they would be ashamed of them, and say they own
   no such principles; yet they own them most expressly as they can, as
   emphatically as they can. For a whole course of actions is a far more
   speaking thing, than words can be; words do only express a man's
   present sense, the present sense of mind: but a series and course of
   actions do speak his constant and continued sense.

   And, O! what a miserable creature is man, upon this account, when the
   habitual complexion of his soul leads him through his whole course, ail
   his days, all his lifetime, but to pursue shadows and lying vanities;
   and at length to lie down in sorrow, hopeless, endless, sorrow.

   And as the will is the so misguided thing, so the principle is wanting,
   too, that should moderate the passions. And what a hell do they create
   in every man to himself, or make him to himself. Every one, if he would
   but consider and reflect might be so far a preacher to himself upon
   this theme, as to save me or any man the labour of representing this
   case--"What a miserable condition the soul of man must be in, being the
   seat of so many passions, all left destitute of the conduct and
   government of any rational principles that should conduct them aright."
   Unreasonable desires, what a hell must they make! desires either after
   that which cannot be had, or which is not worth the having; either what
   is unattainable, or will do me no good; or I shall be never the better
   if I do attain them. To have any soul the continual seat and subject of
   such desires, and of no better, what a fearful case is this!

   His delights, themselves, (though that may seem a paradox,) they are
   most fatal to him, and contribute as much (nay it may be more,) to his
   misery, as his desires; because they detain him, they put a stop to
   him; they divert his course. Delight is the quies appetitus in
   appetibili, it is that by which the soul takes up its end, and is at a
   stop: but in what? in the enjoyment of wind and vanity, that is
   unsatisfying, very unsatisfactory. It is detained and diverted, it is
   withheld, by these, from pursuing what would do it any good, or
   contribute to its true felicity: "The woman that liveth in pleasure, is
   dead while she liveth." Do you think it is not as true in the other
   sex? whoever lives immersed in sensual delights and pleasures, they are
   dead while they live. It is but a dying life that they live.

   And their very hopes make them miserable: they are miserable by their
   own hopes, continually reaching out after that they can never compass;
   or if they do, still they do but fill themselves with the east wind.
   Hope is the spring of endeavours: for no man will endeavour for what he
   is hopeless of. But they do but labour for the wind in all that they
   endeavour, and possess and reap the east wind; that is all that they
   can reach to.

   Their good things will often run cross to them; and then how doth that
   passion of anger corrode and tear them! what a rack is there in the
   soul upon this account, especially when it works up as high as malice
   against men: men that they do an injury to, if it arise to envy, that
   most unreasonable passion; that I would rather be miserable because
   another appears nearer to happiness, in my apprehension, than J he
   enjoyeth what is better, or he is better than myself, therefore I will
   be miserable; that is, I will be envious.

   Add to this, the meditation and study of revenge, whether for real or
   apprehended wrong done to me. It is the most cut ting, wounding
   revenge, that every man takes upon himself. "Such a one I think hath
   hurt me, done me harm, I will revenge it upon myself:" for it is the
   person himself that feels it most of all; (if he have any sense left in
   him;) it makes him a continual hell in himself. It makes him a devil to
   himself, as he would be to another man. It may be he misseth that; but
   as to himself he doth not miss it.

   And as to his griefs, unreasonable griefs, what a deluge of misery are
   they! when men lament and mourn about things unreasonably, beyond
   proportion, (as every unrenewed man is apt to do,) he doth deluge
   himself with those sorrows: and his fears, by which he is continually
   prophesying dismal things to himself, what a miserable creature do they
   make him!

   And all now upon this one account, all the things of this kind, do meet
   in this one juncture, in this one point; to wit, that there is no right
   mind to lead a man: that principle that was originally to have been
   conductive of his course, is gone, and it can never be supplied but by
   the Spirit of wisdom and holiness from above: while that is yet
   withheld and wanting to him, what is it that doth govern in the man? It
   is the spirit of this world, as it is called: "we have not received the
   spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God." Every
   unregenerate man, he is in his spirit under the government of the
   spirit of this world, one common genius which adapts and attempers men
   in their habitual frame into this world, unto this lower sphere.
   "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." The
   contest lies between spirit and spirit; as to what part God hath in
   this world, and as to what part the devil hath in this world. If the
   spirit of this world doth govern in any one, and be the ruling
   principle in him, that unites him with this world; and upon that, all
   his appetitions, and all the various motions and passions of his soul,
   are determined, and confined to this present world, this sensible
   world; he is linked to that in spirit, he hath a spiritual, vital union
   only with this world, and so feels all the pangs, all the paroxysms,
   that, in this lower region, he is subject to: he is always shaken with
   this shaking world, and tossed and hurried, hither and thither, as that
   is.

   What a miserable creature must apostate man be, upon this account! This
   world being become such a region of death and of misery, the spirit of
   this world plungeth and ingulfs him in all that misery, makes him a
   continual partaker in it, as that wherewith he only hath a vital union.
   That Spirit that is of God, would unite him with the other world, and
   attemper him to that which the power of that Spirit (when this world is
   grievous and troublesome to him,) might ascend and go up, and have his
   way above, (as the way of the wise is,) to depart from hell beneath;
   but, the spirit of this world entangles him, ensnares him, fixeth him
   in that gulf, that he can not ascend; can be carried out of this world
   by no thought, no vivid desire, no hopes upwards; his all lies here.

   And, that which is yet more tremendous in this case, is, his continual
   unwillingness, and dread of leaving this world; that fear, to wit, the
   fear of death. What a miserable creature must that make him, to be
   under the continual expectation of what he knows is inevitable, and he
   cannot escape; so that his only remedy in this is not to think of it!
   His relief must be to unteach himself, his own nature; that is, whereas
   he is naturally a thinking thing, he is to stifle such thoughts as are
   proper and suitable to the state of his case. All his care must be to
   make himself not think of that, than which no thought can be more
   proper and suitable to him. For, when I do certainly know that I am, as
   to this present world, this present state, a mortal creature, I should,
   therefore, bethink myself, with all the seriousness and concern
   imaginable, What shall come next? I dwell in an earthly tabernacle,
   which I know must come down, but I do not know, when I shall dislodge,
   where to have another habitation. I cannot say, "I have a building with
   God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,"--no; the
   spirit that governs me is the spirit of this world, and that confines
   me only to this world.

   A man, in this case, is miserable among all his enjoyments, when he
   thinks it goes never so well with him: "I have what heart can wish
   for," as well as that fool in the gospel propounded to himself, to have
   it with him, "I will say to my soul, Take thine ease, thou hast goods
   laid up for many years;" upon this account he is pronounced a fool:
   "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be taken from thee." And whereas,
   that is spoken with peculiar reference to a rich man, yet you must not
   confine it so; for our Saviour saith in the next words, "So it is with
   every man that layeth up treasure for himself, (de signs treasures to
   himself on earth, as every man doth one way or other,) and is not rich
   towards God." "This night shall thy soul he required of thee." O!
   dreadful word, to a man that hath his all here! O the torture that such
   a man must be subjected to, (if he thinks, if he considers,) that hath
   his all lying in this world, and yet, he knows he cannot stay here
   long: "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness."

   This is so great a thing, that it is made one part of the design of the
   mediation of Christ, and his redemption, for which he became a man, and
   for which he took upon him flesh and blood, that he might be so: "that
   he might, by death, destroy him that had the power of death, that is,
   the devil, (undo him as to his design and purpose,) and deliver those
   who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to
   bondage." To be under this unreasonable fear, what a dreadful thing is
   this! In this respect, it is to be called unreasonable, because, when a
   man finds that the thing is necessary, and unavoidable, that he is
   afraid of; all wisdom would direct him to reconcile himself to
   necessity, and never to be at rest in his own spirit, till he finds,
   that as he is to think of death with certainty, so he may think of it
   with complacency too: till, I say, he may upon good terms so do. And
   again,

   xi. We are to consider, as to what is contained in this misery of man,
   that as (which I formerly told you) they have in all this, no relief
   from God, so God hath a real displeasure towards this wretched creature
   in his present state: and, if in his favour be life; in his disfavour
   is death: which way soever he turns, or what way soever he thinks of
   comforting himself, he is still under a nemesis: divine displeasure
   hangs over his head. "God is angry with the wicked every day. The wrath
   of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
   unrighteousness of men. On the wicked he will rain snares, fire and
   brimstone, and a horrible tempest, this shall be the portion of their
   cup." While they continue wicked, and as such, that relates them to the
   divine wrath, constitutes them the proper subjects of it, upon which it
   preys as fire doth upon suitable fuel. And,

   xii. They are not without some apprehensions hereof: misgivings they
   have in their own minds: there is a kind of gloominess and a dark
   shadow, that is cast by guilt over the soul and spirit of a man. He is
   not without some secret surmises, as men cannot rid themselves of all
   notions of God. A person that is habitually wicked, under the power of
   sin as a governing principle in him, cannot but apprehend him as an
   offended God, though his apprehensions be not so distinct, so formed,
   so explicit, yet such secret gnawings and corroding thoughts there will
   be, conscience accusing as well as excusing by turns; as it ought to be
   read: self-accusing thoughts do take turns in the soul. The writings of
   heathens are full of expressions, what the gnawings and tortures are of
   a guilty, misgiving conscience, of a self-accusing conscience. But, in
   the last place, which was mentioned the last time,

   xiii. That which is the more common case, and is more fitly signified
   by the name of death, is, the stupefaction that more generally, and
   more ordinarily, takes place in the minds of men; that they are without
   feeling. Wrath is upon them, and they do not know it. Some more
   unformed thoughts they have, but not explicit and distinct ones; such
   as might affect their hearts, and enter into their very souls: more
   generally their disease is a lethargy, without sense, and without
   feeling. And you know how sad the case may be in that respect, with the
   diseased body of a man. We do not reckon it the better when it can feel
   no pain, while the matter of the disease is present, and all the
   morbific matter remains. If it do not only endanger, but stupify, it is
   so much the more dangerous in common apprehension: and that is the case
   of the soul of an unrenewed, unregenerate man, that lie can be tossed,
   and hurried, and torn, even by himself, by his own passions within him,
   this way, and that way, and yet, he doth not reflect and think with
   himself, "I am a miserable creature;" but misery is become his element:
   where things do not gravitare, they do not lie with pressure, as
   nothing is pressed by being in its element. And misery is become so
   connatural to men, in this their present state, that misery is round
   about them, and they feel it not: the anger of God is preying upon
   them, consuming their souls, but they lay it not to heart, as in Isaiah
   xlii. latter end, the expression is; divine anger is kindling upon this
   world, but they know it not; and destroying and consuming it, but they
   take it not to heart.

   This is that death that is passed over all, as to the spiritual import
   of the expression, or, as it denotes the spiritual evils that do now
   infest the souls of men. But I would, before I had gone off from this
   head, have said somewhat by way of Use to this particular. And though I
   am prevented of saying much, yet, plain it is,

   That whereas man, in this state of apostasy, is now a miserable
   creature, it may be gathered, from all that hath been said upon this
   head, that he generally mistakes the cause of his misery, and so, is as
   much likely to mistake the way and method of his cure. He little
   thinks, his misery is a self-sprung thing, and, that he hath the
   fountain of it in himself. This will not enter into the minds of men.
   "The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways;" Proverbs
   xiv. 14. That word, because it is rendered "backslider," may strike a
   wrong notion into the minds of many, as if, thereby, were meant an
   hypocritical pretender to religion, who hath apostatized, and made a
   defection: but, the word carries no notation at all of any other
   apostasy, than the common apostasy. And it is plain, that by "the
   backslider in heart" there, is meant the wicked man, in general, a
   sinner, in opposition to a righteous and good man, as, generally, the
   two parts of several verses up and down in this book, do distribute men
   into good and bad, by one appellation or another. And, that is a proper
   expression, by which the bad is distinguished from the good man, in
   that verse: the word signifies perverse, froward; a fit character for a
   wicked man, an unconverted man; such a one "shall be filled with his
   own ways," as the good man is so satisfied from himself. The good man
   is not the first fountain of happiness to himself, but a subordinate
   one a good man is, and so is satisfied from himself. But the wicked man
   is the prime and first fountain of all misery to himself: and,
   therefore, when these wicked ones have any sense at all of their own
   miseries, they do create to every man a hell within himself.

   But this is a thing least of all apprehended: men generally say, "What
   is the matter with me? what aileth me? I can not be well, I cannot be
   quiet;" and, they would have this or that thing rectified, in their
   external circumstances, and they think that will do their business;
   but, alas! that will not do. They talk of flying from their misery,
   but, that they cannot do, unless they could fly from themselves. I
   remember the moralist saith, "Go whither thou wilt, that intolerable
   companion, (thyself) will go with thee, wheresoever thou flyest, and
   layest down thine head." Till thou art new-made, thou art self-made,
   for misery. God must new-make thee, if ever thou art happy. And,
   therefore, an amazing wonder it is, that men should so much mind things
   that are foreign to them, and never cast their eye upon themselves, or
   think how it is within. They are greatly concerned how affairs go in
   France, in Flanders, in Germany; but never think how it goes within. O!
   what a miserable world will it be, (it may be often said by such,) if
   that side prevail over the other side! What a miserable world will this
   be then! But men do thus think altogether amiss, and besides the
   purpose: what good will it do to me if so good men, and never so good a
   cause, prevail and prosper in the world, when I have my own hell within
   myself? I shall be a miserable creature still, till all be rectified
   within. It is not a new world, but being a new man, that can ease me,
   relieve me, and make me a happy creature.

   It doth not lie in the power of all the world to make me a happy or
   miserable man. You may think, if such and such a party of men prevail,
   we are all undone, we shall be very miserable. But, I tell you, it will
   be in their power only to make you miserable, in whose power it is to
   make you ill men. If it be not in the power of any in all the world to
   make you ill men, they can never make you miserable men. If it were in
   the power of men, to pluck you off from God, to disaffect you to him,
   that you take no complacency in him, that you cannot love him, nor pour
   out your soul to him, this would make you miserable. But, it is not in
   the power of all this world to make any man miserable, that doth not
   make and keep himself wicked.

   " And so death passed over all men."

LECTURE XXXII. [47]

   You know our business upon these latter words hath been, more lately,
   to give an account of that death, which is said to have passed over
   all. And, therein, we proposed to consider it,

   (1.) In its nature, in which respect it is common to all. And,

   (2.) In its degrees, in respect whereof it admits of great difference,
   according to the several circumstances of men's states. We have been
   hitherto speaking to it upon the former account, and labouring to shew
   you its ambitus and extent, of how vast a comprehension it is, what a
   mighty sum of misery it carries in it. That misery, we shewed, must
   involve,

   [1.] Bodily death, with all the tendencies and appurtenances, (as I may
   say,) thereunto. And then, we have more largely insisted,

   [2.] In shewing that here must be included in it, death spiritual, such
   as the souls of men are liable to, and susceptible of; death, not in
   the natural, but in the moral sense. In the former sense, souls cannot
   die, as is an agreed thing, among all: and, in the moral sense, because
   morality doth comprehend both men's duty, and their felicity, we are
   not, (as was told you,) here, to consider it in opposition to the
   former of these: for so we spake to this death, as it falls under the
   head of sin, in that other clause of the verse: but, as it stands in
   opposition to felicity, and to the real blessedness of the souls of
   men. Or, (as was told you,) that aversion from God, which sums up all
   in point of evil; as a right propension towards him, or love to him,
   sums up all in point of good. That aversion from God, it may be either
   from him as the Sovereign Authority, and so it stands in opposition to
   our duty; or, as it is an aversion from him as the Sovereign Good, and,
   so it stands in opposition to our felicity. And so, we considered
   spiritual death. And, it is called death, (as hath been noted to you)
   in an equivalent sense, as that which serves not the end it was
   designed for, and so is all one as if it were not. When the souls of
   men will not serve the natural end to which such beings were originally
   designed, it is all one as if they were not. They are lost as to their
   proper end, both as they were to be serviceable to God, and as they
   were capable subjects of felicity for themselves; for, that double end
   was to be designed by them, though the one in subordination to the
   other.

   Now, I go on in the next place,

   [3.] To note further to you, that, under the name of "death," we may
   also understand that condemnation, which the whole apostate world lies
   under. This is a thing that, fitly enough, is to be conceived under the
   notion of this death, that is said to be "passed upon all." Whatsoever
   there is of present death upon this world, it lies under a doom to
   more, to that which I may say, is more deadly) and more dreadful.

   And I need not insist, in opening to you so obvious and so plain a
   thing to any one's understanding, how properly a condemned man may be
   said to be a dead man. A world under a doom unto a future misery,
   (besides all that is actually incumbent on it,) how properly, in that
   respect, death may be said to have passed over all. One that is under
   condemnation is dead in law; he hath no longer a legal title to his
   life. The law doth not further protect his life, is no longer a
   guardian to it; yea, and it doth not only withhold its protection, but
   doth direct its sword against such a one's life, and cut it off.

   This is the common state of this world; it lies under a doom: besides
   all the actual miseries that are upon it, it is doomed to worse; "death
   hath passed over all;" but that death is in a continual tendency, (as
   being yet but begun,) to a consummate state of death. Death finished,
   is approaching; and men are, by the righteous judgment of God, led on,
   hurried on, towards the consummate state of misery or death, that is
   most righteously determined upon them. And this, the context can by no
   means allow us to overlook. It is inculcated again and again, in the 16
   and 18 verses of this chapter: "that judgment is come upon all men to
   condemnation." This whole apostate world stands condemned by the
   righteous judgment of God. And so, as justification is, in a relative
   and respective sense, the life of the soul; so is condemnation the
   death of it. That passage, in the same context--"the justification of
   life," it carries that manifest import: and condemnation doth as truly
   carry death in it, as justification doth life.

   Antecedently to that change which God makes in the state of men,
   condemnation is a thing belonging to them, as when such a change is
   made, in the state of any that are brought into union with Christ:
   "There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus;" Romans
   viii. 1. But that tells us what the common state and case of the rest
   is; there is no condemnation to them, they lie under a universal
   condemnation; they are, (as the apostle's most apt and emphatical
   expression is,) upodikos, we render it, become guilty; the meaning is
   impleadable before God, liable to be impleaded by law, in jus vocari,
   to be called to account. And, as the course that men have held,
   according to natural corrupt inclination, is unaccountable, so they are
   liable to be brought under judgment before the Lord.

   This condemnation is to be understood to be as its opposite
   justification, either (as some fitly enough express the matter under
   those terms,) constitutive, or sentential: either they are, by the
   constitution of the law, condemned, and that is to be condemned
   virtually, by that sentence which is written in the law, by which they
   are to be judged; or sententially, which is that condemnation that is
   to be pronounced upon them at the last by the mouth of their Judge.
   Justification is taken the same, two ways. A person may be said to be
   justified, either when the law doth constitute him just, or else there
   is a final justification, when he is pronounced or declared so, from
   the judgment seat, by the mouth of the Supreme and Universal Judge.

   It is in the former sense that the world lies under condemnation. As a
   person that hath violated and broken the law, by the commission of some
   capital crime, though he be not formally condemned, by the mouth of the
   judge, yet the law condemns him beforehand. And there must be the less
   difference in this, case, in foro divino, then would be in foro humano;
   because the judgment of God will always, at last, pass according lo the
   mind and intendment of the law, when many things may prevent its doing
   so in human judicatures: this is one sense wherein death is further
   said to have passed over all. All are under a general doom; their lives
   are actually forfeited; the forfeiture may be taken whenever God will.
   Men are at mercy, respited from the utmost of death, and by patience,
   (without promise,) as a condemned person may be executed whenever the
   prince pleaseth; there is no moment of time given to him; he can claim
   no addition to his life. Thus it is with all men. "So death hath passed
   over all." And lastly,

   [4.] We are to consider within the compass and extent of this death,
   that eternal death itself, unto which this doom, this judgment, makes
   men liable and subject: and that hath actually passed upon as many as
   have died impenitent, and not reduced, not brought hack to God, through
   the several thousands of years that are revolved and gone over this
   world already. And as to what remains of human generation, death may be
   said to have passed in that respect, even over all of them too, it
   being as sure that they will come into the depth of that death, as if
   they were plunged into it already,--supposing their continuing not
   reconciled, not reduced, not recovered, out of the common state of
   apostasy. Concerning that death, it doth more properly belong to
   another topic or place in theology; and therefore, I shall not
   discourse of it here; only hint thus much concerning it, that it cannot
   differ in kind, and in the main substance, from that spiritual death,
   which we have spoken of already. As spiritual life doth not differ
   substantially from eternal life; so, nor doth this spiritual death
   differ in substance from eternal death, any more than a child newly
   born, doth differ in nature, or specifically from a grown man.
   Spiritual life will grow up into eternal life. Spiritual death will
   grow up into death eternal. It will, hereafter, consist-and lie in
   separation from God, and in subjection to his wrath; even as now it
   doth; the difference herein is only as to the degrees, and as to du
   ration and continuance. There is now a loss of God, as our best and
   most satisfying Good: and so there will be to all eternity. There is
   now a subjection to his displeasure, and various manifold impressions
   therefrom; there will be higher and fuller degrees hereafter. Both that
   which is called poena damni, the punishment of loss, and that which is
   called poena sensus, the punishment of sense, will have unspeakable,
   unconceivable additions hereafter. But there is the same thing in
   reality now, with every ungodly man, every one that is not reconciled
   to God. Though, by the way, I could never satisfy my self concerning
   the fulness of these terms, poena damni, and poena sensus, the
   punishment of loss, and the punishment of sense; for, undoubtedly, the
   former, the punishment of loss, is as sensible as the other, every
   whit; we do not know but that it may be more so. Souls will be
   eternally stung with their loss, as much as with any positive
   suffering: as a man may be as sensibly pained by hunger, as he may be
   by a dagger, that strikes him to the heart. But that only by the by.

   These are the great things, that this same death in the text, which is
   said to "have passed over all," must be understood to comprehend and
   contain within the extent of it. And so far we have considered it, but
   in its kind, wherein it is common to all. But if,

   (2.) We should also consider it in its degrees, so there will be found
   to be great differences. It will not be in degree the same to all, but
   differ and vary, according to the very various circumstances of men's
   states, whether we consider the matter, with reference to the natural
   tendency of things, or whether we consider it, with reference to the
   righteous judgment of God: both in nature and divine judgment, there
   must needs be great differences between the miseries of some, and of
   others. There is, in this present state, and there will be, no doubt,
   in the future state too, where all the subjects of wrath are called
   "vessels of wrath;" but those vessels are not all of the same capacity;
   some vessels will hold more than others do: and their capacity and
   measure hereafter, will be much according to what is here in this
   present state.

   And, I shall only here hint, at some of the more obvious things that
   must difference the state of men, in point of that misery which hath
   deluged, and will deluge for ever, the apostate world. It hath
   different degrees of depth, as the ocean hath; which, though in some
   places we may suppose it a hundred fathom deep, and in other places not
   above two or three, yet, it is deep enough to drown all. So is this
   deluge of misery upon fallen mankind; though as to some deeper, than it
   is as to others, yet, it is deep enough to drown all in misery and
   destruction. As the apostle's expression is, 1 Tim. vi. 9. But to name
   to you some things that more obviously do appear to difference the case
   of men's states, in point of misery, or that death which here is said
   to have passed over all. As,

   [I.] There must needs be some difference, from the better or worse
   complexion of nature, that is to be found with some and with others; of
   which some heathens do fitly enough speak. There is such a thing as
   good nature in this world, obvious enough to the observation of every
   one, as there is ill nature, observable enough in others. These must
   make very great differences in the state of men's case, if we consider
   the matter according to the ducture and tendency of mere nature. So
   that, whereas the natures of some do render them less propense to vice,
   it is also possible, that, as they are less vicious, this will be one
   of the measures, that they will be hereafter less miserable, but
   miserable still; and, notwithstanding not being reconciled to God,
   being turned, renewed, changed, never made partakers of the divine
   nature.

   But, if you consider that case morally, then the better natured any
   are, supposing that they do violence to that nature, they spoil that
   nature, and make it much worse;--then, I say, the better natured, the
   more miserable; for they are undoubtedly the more guilty. Many
   well-tempered persons, of much ingenuity, of good disposition, that are
   not inclined to do ill things to other men; but they are continually
   propense to all acts of injustice towards God: him they will not know;
   from him they are habitually alienated; never look after reconciliation
   with him. It may be, when they were not naturally inclined, yet, they
   have taught themselves to be more grossly and sensibly vicious; and so
   have that way, and in that respect, spoiled a good nature, done, in
   that respect, continual violence to themselves; learned to be wicked,
   even beyond what they were inclined: here must be so much the deeper
   condemnation.

   A thing, I am afraid, very little considered by parents, in reference
   to the children of their womb and loins; branches of themselves, whose
   tempers they make it their business to cultivate as they grow up. But,
   many parents have not only neglected this, but have made it their
   business to instil (as much as in them lay,) vicious inclinations into
   them: or they have so managed matters towards them, as to make them
   craspish, peevish, and froward, to embitter their tempers, and to lay
   foundations betimes, both of present and everlasting misery, in their
   very tempers, in their spoiled, or not improved tempers. Many parents
   might more mercifully, with more kindness, pluck out their children's
   eyes, and cut off their limbs, than indulge the vicious humours which
   appear in them be times; and wherein is a foundation laid for their
   misery in this world, as well as for future and eternal misery, when
   their tempers are so spoiled, as to be cross, peevish, froward,
   discontented, quarrelsome. Alas! much of this might have been
   qualified, and prevented, betimes. But, in the mean time, that there is
   such a thing as better and worse nature, which, may, in different
   respects, make present and future misery, more or less, is out of all
   question. But,

   [2.] That which is more considerable, is, that they must be plunged
   deeper into this death, who live in sin to the last, unconverted to
   God, and unreduced under the gospel, than they that never enjoyed a
   gospel: this must make a vast difference in the states of men. "This is
   the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love
   darkness more than light." John iii. 19. When the gospel itself becomes
   deadly to men, that is a most terrible sort of death:--to die by a
   gospel-plague, is a most terrible way of dying! Death passed upon all,
   but it triumphs more, and with greater terror, over that part of the
   world where gospel light shines, but is wickedly resisted, opposed,
   sinned against, and the design of it counterwrought; that is, as in
   that mentioned place, it is expressed, "Men love darkness more than
   light:" the darkness better pleaseth them, is more grateful to them, as
   it gives them opportunity of being wicked still. The light offends men;
   they cannot endure (as it is in that context) to have their deeds
   brought to the light; resolved they are upon a course of wickedness.
   Where there is an honest, sincere mind, he affects light, runs into the
   light, that it may appear, that his works are wrought in God, that the
   divine tincture and impress that is upon his works, may show itself,
   and appear. There is that in them, which is very agreeable and
   congruous to the light. But, when men have a resolution of being
   wicked, then they are for a corner. "There is no darkness, or shadow of
   death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves:" that implies
   what they affect; they would have a shadow of death wherein to hide
   themselves: that which they covet is, "Where shall we be hid?" It is a
   night they seek, and a cloud; nocte peccatur. When there is a course of
   dispensation kept on foot towards men all their time, to keep them
   within the light, to hold them within the region and verge of gospel
   light; this is that which they could wish extinct: "O! that this light
   were out." As they are brought speaking in that Isaiah xxx. 1. "Cause
   the holy One of Israel to cease from before us. His bright and glorious
   appearances, they are ungrateful and unwelcome to us. O! who will take
   away God, and that divine light, that shines so much to our disturbance
   and annoyance; we wish it gone."

   But more tolerable will it be to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Tyre and Sidon,
   in the day of judgment, than to Capernaum and Bethsaida, (as our
   Saviour inculcates in the xi. Matt. 22 and onwards, when he upbraids
   those cities, where his wonderful works were done,) where there were so
   bright and glorious appearances of divine power, attesting and bearing
   witness to that truth which he came to publish to the world. O! Woe,
   woe, to them, among whom there have been such glorious appearances of
   God, but counter-striven and resisted. Though there will be one common
   hell to all in time, yet, the hell of Sodom and Gomorrah will be a more
   tolerable hell, than theirs. And again,

   The case must, in point of misery, be worse with them who, living under
   the gospel, had a better parentage, were born of godly parents, than
   with others with whom it was not so. And that upon a double
   account:--Because, that such would certainly devote them to God;
   and,--as they would be more intent upon educating them for God. Here,
   come in very great differences in the case of such, from the more
   common case.

   First. I say, they that were born of religious parents, those parents
   would, by conscience of duty, be obliged and urged to devote them to
   God; to take care that those great and venerable names, the name of the
   Father, the name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Ghost, should,
   according to divine appointment, be early named upon them, to signify
   whose they were, and to whom they did belong. But they afterwards, when
   they are grown up, refuse to stand to that covenant, according to the
   tenour whereof so early a dedication was made of them. "We will not
   have our parents' God to be our God." Thy friend, and thy father's
   friend, forsake not. A horrid thing that were: but how horrid to
   forsake our God, and our father's God. When man's case shall, in this
   respect, be brought into judgment at the last day--Thou wast born of
   such and such parents, that recognised God's right of thee be times;
   for it is only a recognition of God's right. It is not the creation of
   any right to him, nothing can be given him, that was not his before,
   but only a recognizing his right, and this hath been done with
   solemnity. "But thou, when thou wast grown up, wouldst not stand to the
   covenant of thy father; thy father's God should not be thy God." How
   much more dreadful must be the case of such, than that of pagans, in
   the grossest darkness! And again,

   Secondly. Such parents must be supposed to have educated them for God,
   pursuantly to their having devoted them to him. But, alas! many in our
   days, have counted it a glory to have broken loose out of the fetters
   of a pious education; to have thrown them off, torn their bonds, as
   Samson did his withes and cords; and therein they think they have
   shewed themselves mighty men; that this was a great piece of fortitude
   and courage, to outface God and heaven; and to bend themselves to a
   course of wickedness, in opposition to whatsoever of good principles
   were endeavoured to be implanted; that is, principles of truth, which
   were laboured to be infused and inlaid into their minds; and of
   practical truth, such as might have a tendency to form and govern their
   practice. Their godly parents did, no doubt, charge their own
   consciences with duty, in this kind, to teach their children the train
   of their ways be times, that "when they were old they might not depart
   from them." But as for such as have formed their way, and broken loose,
   undoubtedly the child of a pagan, though it perish, yet perisheth under
   less guilt than such. And,

   [4,] There cannot but be great differences, too, according as among
   those that live under the gospel; some have lived under a more powerful
   ministry than others: where the same gospel for substance is preached,
   it cannot but be acknowledged, that it is preached by some more
   convictively, with more pungency, and with greater aptitude to do good,
   than others: many are more closely urged, and dealt withal, from time
   to time, in the ministry of the word, than others are. And, according
   as men's case may differ in this respect, so will this death, that
   passeth on them, have more or less of deadliness in it. And (as was
   said) when the gospel is "a savour of death," so as that men die of a
   gospel plague, it is a fearful way of dying. But the savour of the
   gospel, or the odour, rather, (as that word should be read,) is
   stronger, as it is diffused by some than by others. But if it prove
   deadly, by how much the stronger, by how much the more of efficacy, so
   much the more, may it be said, doth the death that ensueth partake of
   the horror of death. And again,

   [5.] There cannot but be great difference, too, according as some do
   sin against greater convictions of conscience than others. Having more
   of internal light let into their minds, and which, therefore, they are
   put to have a closer contest and grapple; the case cannot but be so
   much the worse, unto how much the more of conviction men do oppose
   themselves in a wicked course; convinced, but yet go on: convinced that
   they should turn to God, but never turn; that they should break off
   such wicked ways, but they persist in them; that they should engage in
   such and such ways of duty, but they decline them. That conscience
   which doth not govern, it doth judge, it doth doom, and doom so much
   the more heavily, by how much the more of resistance its tendency to
   govern meets with. And,

   [6.] There must he deeper degrees of this misery and death; according
   as there have been stronger strivings of the Spirit of God; God still
   resisted and striven against. Where his gospel is, there his Spirit
   will more or less, and in one kind or other, beat work; but it works at
   liberty. God works in you "to will and to do of his own good pleasure."
   And, I doubt the emphasis of that scripture, is not noted as it should
   be, and the correspondence of part to part in it. Phil ii. 12, 13.
   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God
   that worketh, (or is working) in you, to will and to do of his good
   pleasure." Work because he worketh. There is the substance of the
   precept enforced by that which we are to consider as substantial in the
   motive. Do you work, be cause he worketh. But then, there is a
   circumstance in the precept, unto which a circumstance in the motive
   doth also correspond; work you with fear and trembling: Why? be cause
   God works at will and pleasure, under no obligation, but may desist;
   may give off, when he will. Now then, he being at perfect liberty,
   under no bonds or tie, he may strive longer with some, than he doth
   with others: and, according as he doth longer continue to strive, or as
   he doth more earnestly plead, (but yet in a way short of victorious,
   all-conquering grace, which bears all down before it,) so, the guilt
   cannot but be the greater, that is incurred by continual resistance;
   and, they must needs sink themselves so much the deeper into misery and
   death: they that have some taste of the good word of God, and been made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost, and the powers of the world to come, and,
   yet sin themselves into such a state, as that their repentance becomes
   finally impossible. Perhaps, it may admit of a gentler meaning as to
   some; but that such an expression is used as admits of a latitude,
   there appears so much the more of divine wisdom in it. But it is plain,
   that many never do repent. By how much the more of vigorous efforts
   have been put forth upon them, without effect, so much the more,
   undoubtedly, must they finally incur of this misery, or sink the deeper
   into this death.

   There is a sorer punishment, that is incurred by sinning against that
   gospel, wherein that Spirit breathes, than could be by sinning against
   the law of Moses; as in that Heb. x. 28 and onward. "If he that
   despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses; of
   how much sorer punishment, suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who
   hath trod den under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of
   the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unclean thing, and hath
   done despite unto the Spirit of grace?" There lies the achme and height
   of the wickedness that appeal's in this case: that is, that Spirit is a
   Spirit of grace, that they have been contending and striving against;
   that Spirit of all goodness, and love, and kindness, and benignity: to
   have striven against that Spirit, to the last breath, of how much sorer
   punishment shall such be thought worthy? The sinning against one's own
   conscience, it is doing a violence to one's self, and to what God hath
   made superior and governing in us, did appoint it to be so. But this is
   a more immediate and direct affront to heaven, when resistance is made
   to the Spirit of God himself, who insinuates, slides into the mind,
   repeats and inculcates from time; and still in vain. It is a fearful
   thing when men do engage in a continual war with their own
   consciences,--it is unnatural; and it is a great offence against God
   too. Heathens have thought so; as particularly Marcus Antoninus: "that
   warned men, if they would live well, they must live with God, and keep
   up a conversation with God, and that (saith he) w shall do, if we do
   not offer violence to, and tear that vicarious God that is in us, which
   God hath set over every man to be the guide of his life." But when an
   affront is offered to God himself, the Supreme Good, (as I may say,)
   not to that vicarious God, but to the very Divine Throne: this is a
   fearful thing to do so. And so it is when men are continually fighting
   against that Spirit, that breathes in the gospel. And,

   [7.] I might add that, undoubtedly, men's guilt and misery must be
   greater and deeper, according as they do arrive to great pitches of
   sin. As such come more explicitly to hate every thing of goodness, to
   deride and scorn it, according to the gradations that are observable in
   the beginning of the first psalm, they at length seat themselves in the
   scorner's chair; they that make it their business to ridicule religion
   or godliness; or they that sink themselves into deeper degrees of
   sensuality, why, according as the wickedness in which they wallow is
   fouler and grosser, so it cannot be but their misery must be the
   greater in which they involve themselves. And,

   [8.] They must needs be in the worst case, in point of misery, that are
   more instrumental in spreading wickedness in the world; whose
   wickedness is more diffusive; who are mere partakers of other men's
   sins. There can be no such thing as supererogation, in point of merit,
   by good works; but, no doubt, there may be in point of demerit, by
   wicked works, according as men do draw in more accomplices, and do more
   join in a conspiracy against God and heaven. So much the more guilt, so
   much the more miserable must they be. And again,

   [9.] Such as are wicked in public stations, they must proportionably be
   more guilty and more miserable; wicked magistrates and wicked
   ministers, according to the greater hurt that they do, or the less good
   that they do, being intrusted with such talents, or having such power,
   such opportunities improvable for good, put into their hands.

   And lastly, coeteris paribus--They that live longer in sin, must sink
   deeper into death, supposing all things concur equally, the longer the
   worse. The sinner of a hundred years old, he is the more deeply and
   dreadfully accursed. As in that Isaiah lxv. 20. So we see there cannot
   but be different gradations, or graduate differences in that death,
   which, in the kind and nature of it, is common to all.

   This doth claim somewhat of general use, which, I cannot insist on now:
   no subject can claim it more than this doth, to which we can apply, or
   turn ourselves, as you may hear afterwards.

LECTURE XXXIII. [48]

   Use. We therefore come, in the last place, to improve what hath been
   said of this death, by way of application.

   1 And we may learn hence, inasmuch as death is said to have passed over
   all, for that all have sinned; that God is not unobservant of the ways
   of men in this world, nor indifferent how they demean themselves. Have
   all sinned? Death passed over all. They that think God hath forsaken
   the earth, concerns not himself in human affairs; Why do they think so?
   It is true, the judgment day, and the state of retribution are not yet
   come. But, in the mean time, are there no tokens and indications upon
   men, of divine displeasure? Is there nothing to signify that he is not
   well pleased with a wicked world? Indeed, because his judgments are not
   executed with greater terror, therefore, many times, men's hearts are
   set in them to do evil. And if things run long on with them, after one
   manner, because they have no changes, they fear not God. But, if they
   would use their understandings, which can go a greater compass than
   sense; and, if they would look about, and not consider merely and
   abstractly what they themselves do now at present feel, but what
   appearances there may be perceived of divine displeasure towards this
   world in general, they may see by tokens express enough, that God is
   not well pleased with the state of things in this world, and with the
   course, and carriage of men in it. They may see that his wrath "is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
   men; for how constantly is death every where following sin, death
   passing upon all men, for that all have sinned. When death is making,
   in a more sensible way, such spoils and havoc in this world, tumbling
   men into the dust every where, and none escapes--What! have men reason
   yet to think, that God is indifferent how they carry themselves; that
   he takes no notice whether men obey him, or disobey him? But again,

   2. Since this is the very state of the case, death past upon all, or
   men are generally in a miserable state; we may collect, hence, that
   God's deportment towards men, is very becoming of him, and most
   suitable to the state of their case. t( Death hath passed over all, for
   that all have sinned." Nothing could be more worthy of God, than to let
   it be as it is with men, in this respect; that is, to let death pass
   over all; that it should spread its dark and horrid shadow over this
   world, as we find it every where doth. Nothing could, I say, be more
   worthy of God, or more suitable to the state and condition wherein sin
   hath constituted the sons of men. And this will appear yet more
   distinctly, whether we consider God's dispensation towards men, in this
   respect, for the present; or, whether you consider, again, his
   determination concerning them for the future.

   (1.) If we consider his dispensation towards them, for the present,
   nothing could be more becoming, more worthy of God, or more suitable to
   such a creature as man, now in his lapsed and apostate state. For, as
   to his present dispensation, you may find a concurrence of two things:
   first, such a severity, as wherein God doth most becomingly animadvert
   upon the sinfulness of the world, and shew himself displeased; and
   secondly, such, lenity, as by which he yet signifies himself placable
   and willing to be reconciled. Nothing could be more suitable, more
   becoming God, considering the present state of lapsed man, with respect
   to the tenour of his present dispensation towards him, than that there
   should be such a mixture as this of God's conduct towards this world:
   that is, severity, to shew that he is not well pleased; lenity, to
   signify that he is yet placable. What could be more becoming God? Both
   these are interwoven in the whole course of God's dealings with men; as
   hath been told you. There have been tokens of severity, that men might
   understand and know that God doth not like their ways and manners.
   Death is every where playing its part, and rolling men into the grave
   before one another's eyes. And men may every where perceive the effects
   of a malediction upon themselves, and upon their concernments and
   affairs in this world. But yet, notwithstanding, there are
   significations, too, of God's placableness, his willingness to be
   reconciled, even where there is no gospel, hut much more where there
   is: where there is no gospel, God leaves not himself without witness in
   that he doth good, giving men rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
   and filling their hearts with food and gladness. And even his patience,
   and forbearance, and long-suffering, they have a leadingness, (as we
   have had occasion at large to shew you) unto repentance. And men will
   have a fearful account one day to make of it, that have not been led
   thereunto, nor understood that design.

   But where the gospel comes, there (you know) God shews himself as he is
   in Christ, "reconciling the world to himself, that sin might not be
   imputed." 2 Cor. v. 19. What can be more suitable than this, to a Being
   of most absolute perfection, in whom the perfections of wisdom, and
   justice, and holiness, are in conjunction with the perfections of
   kindness, goodness, love, and favourable propensions towards his
   creatures: nor could any be more suitable to men in this their present
   state, (it being a state of probation,) a state of trial, of leading,
   and precedaneous to another state.

   And, according to all the measures of wisdom and equity, this is always
   reckoned most suitable where there is guilt that appears chargeable,
   and that it may be charged; and that, while as yet a public judgment is
   not given, and hath not had its effect. If we do but consider, (and,
   indeed, we can but judge as men, of things, and use the best
   understanding as such, that we have,) we see how men do commonly judge
   in such and the like cases. That is, suppose one be vehemently
   suspected of some flagitious crime among men, but the matter is not yet
   brought to judgment; such a person is neither to be treated as an
   innocent person, nor as a convicted one. You know that so the wisdom of
   human governments doth determine every where. And the case speaks
   itself, that these are apt, and fit, and suitable methods; they carry
   their own reason in them. Such persons, before the solemn public
   judgment, and the consequent execution upon that judgment, are neither,
   I say, treated as innocent, nor as convicted; but there is a mixture in
   the treatment, which they generally find and meet with: some kind of
   severity they do undergo even before their trial and judgment, which
   may be looked upon as someway penal: and in some degree it is so. Nor
   is there any thing of severity used towards such, but upon some proof,
   upon some evidence, as such persons are convened and accused before a
   magistrate, convicted in some way, though they have not a full
   conviction: they are brought before them, committed by them, held under
   restraint, that justice may not be eluded; but that they may be in safe
   custody. But yet, for all that, there is no formal judgment passed upon
   them, nor execution consequent unto such judgment, till there have been
   a very formal trial, and a full conviction,

   Much at the same rate, is the state of the case here between God and
   men, though not for the same reasons, not in all respects for the same;
   not that the delinquents may be in safe custody, and so finally not
   escape his justice; for he knows well where to have them at any time,
   and any where. Nor is any thing of lenity used towards them, upon the
   account that they are not convicted, nor fully convicted. For every
   man's case lies perfectly open to the divine view; but there is
   severity used towards them, partly for warning to others, and partly
   for monition and excitation to themselves; because God intends a
   treaty, and deals with them in order to pardon and forgiveness, which
   is not the usual design of human governments. And for the same reason
   is lenity used towards them; not because they are not convicted: for
   their matter hath, to the divine eye, a thorough perspection, and the
   whole state of their case at last is seen through and through. But, as
   was said, that by such gentleness they may be more treatable, and
   capable of being applied to, in order to their conversion, and final
   salvation. But, upon the whole, nothing could be more becoming of God,
   than that there should be such a mixture as we find of severity and
   lenity, in this present dispensation, antecedent to the future judgment
   that is to pass upon them. And then,

   (2.) Nothing could be more becoming of God, than the determination that
   he settles concerning man for the future; that is, that this death, in
   all the fulness of it, shall finally be inflicted upon them that are
   finally impenitent; those that persevere in enmity and rebellion to the
   last, and never consort with, never hearken to the terms and overtures
   of reconciliation; for what else should be done in such a case as this?
   Do but consider the nature of man. He hath a mortal part about him. It
   is not reasonable to think, that God should make that mortal part
   immortal, only that men might continue sinning against him, on earth,
   uninterruptedly and everlastingly. Was that to be expected that it
   should be so? And he hath an immortal part, a mind and spirit that is
   immortal. What should be done in such a case, with such a creature as
   man? was he to annihilate that immortal part? That was as little to be
   expected, that God should have made such a creature with such a nature,
   and then seem to repent that he had made him such, and so that he
   should immortalize that which was mortal; or, as I may say, mortalize
   that which was immortal.

   But, I say, that he should do either the one or the other, was for no
   reason in the world to have been expected from God, the great Lord and
   Maker of all. He deals with the creatures that he hath made, suitable
   to the natures that he hath given them. It could not be any blemish to
   the divine perfections, that he made man at the first with such a
   nature. If his mortal part always hanged about him, it should have made
   him capable of no higher felicity than this earth did afford: and sure
   that had been a diminution of the divine goodness. If he had not made
   him with an immortal mind and spirit, he had not been capable of
   felicity, as he had not, it is true, been liable to endless misery. But
   then, he had not been capable of future felicity. Therefore, consider
   the matter how you will; look upon all men as having sinned, and
   consider death here upon to have passed over all, nothing could, in
   this case, be more becoming of God, than his deportment towards men;
   whether you consider his present dispensations towards him, or whether
   you consider his determinations for the future. But then,

   3. We have this further to collect, that men's deportment, in this
   case, is most unsuitable, most unbecoming of them, and most
   unanswerable to the state of their own case. Death hath passed over
   all. Do men carry it suitable hereunto? We might, in many instances,
   shew you how far they are from doing so, from carrying it suitable to
   this state of their case; that is, their being under a universal death,

   (1.) Very plain it is, that many never think any such thought,--"I am
   under a doom." It is true, they cannot escape thinking themselves
   mortal, and that sometime or other they must die: but that this is a
   doom, a sentence upon them from an offended Creator; how many are there
   that pass away their days, and never think such a thought? "I am a
   sinful creature; and God hath been offended; and, therefore, I must
   die: and, therefore, I am, in many other respects, miserable in the
   mean time." How many that never think one such thought, that never
   consider the state of their case as it relates to God. The miseries
   that befal men here under the sun, they seem to apprehend as if they
   sprung out of the dust, but apprehend nothing of a nemesis, of a
   vindicta, of divine displeasure therein.

   Indeed, if there were a correspondency in the temper of men's souls,
   unto the state of their case, in this respect, where in soever God
   testifies his resentment, they would have a resentment. By all these
   efforts of present divine justice, upon an apostate world, God is
   expressing this his resentment: "I am ill used by my own creatures;"
   that is the language of every such providence. "The creatures that I
   have made, carry it insolently, injuriously, undutifully to me."
   Providences are vocal and articulate, do not only carry a voice with
   them many times, but a voice that is expressive of a meaning, which is
   interpretable; the Lord's voice cries many times to the city, and, in
   general, it speaks this sense every where; where his providences are
   afflictive, and reach men's bones, and their flesh, or touch them in
   any other sensible effect, God is angry, these are the breakings forth
   of his just displeasure towards a wicked world, against sinful revolted
   creatures. But with the most, there is nothing of this kind thought of:
   and therefore, they are full of lamentations for the evils that do
   befal them, accounting them infelicities; but never look upon them as
   penalties; which, if they did, that would carry a signification with it
   of their own guiltiness; that these things befal me as a sinner, and as
   an offending creature. And,

   (2.) Where there are any such thoughts, how rarely do they stay in the
   minds of men, and how seldom do they dwell upon the contemplation of
   any such thing? Whereas, if matters were with men as they should be, in
   these respects, these should be their thoughts lying down and rising
   up, and from day to day, all the day long, as while men do yet remain
   in an impenitent and unreconciled state. God speaks his mind in
   reference to such, that he "is angry with the wicked every day;" so
   then it should be thought of every day. And it would make men's spirits
   most restless and uneasy within them. O! what an insupportable thing is
   it to be under the displeasure of him that made me! and that he should
   be angry with me every day: that his displeasure should be upon me,
   even while i am eating, as was said concerning the people in the
   wilderness: "his wrath came upon them while they were eating, while the
   meat was yet in their mouths." Sure it would make a man never eat with
   pleasure, when this should be understood to be the state of his case.
   And again,

   (3.) Men do not meditate an escape. How little is there to be seen of
   any such thing, in this world, as flying from the wrath to come? as
   John the Baptist's auditors are said to be doing in a kind of
   fright--"Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" How
   little is it, that looks like this, in this wretched world! There would
   be consultations, if men were aware of this state of their case, and
   their spirits were impressed any way suitable to it. There would he
   counsel held: "We are under divine displeasure; what course shall we
   take to avert it? to appease that anger which we cannot bear; which
   will consume and burn up all before it, if it continue unappeased?" And
   again,

   (4.) For the most part, men are taken up about alien things, things
   most alien and remote from any thing of this kind, or what the exigency
   of their case requires and calls for; even though they are warned and
   told of it, and called upon from time to time. This is no new or
   strange doctrine among us, who live under the gospel; that the state of
   man is a state of sin and misery: to tell men, you are by nature
   children of wrath; you are under guilt; you are sinners; and ft the
   wages of sin is death;" this is not strange to the ears of men. You
   cannot have lived years together under this gospel, but you must have
   heard of these things often: and surely the generality of them who were
   wont to hear the gospel, do hear these things frequently inculcated.
   But what are the workings of their minds and thoughts? Do they bear any
   correspondency to such things as these, so often urged upon them? "You
   are a guilty creature," saith the word of God unto them: "you are under
   death; What will you do in this case? what course will you take?" "Why,
   I will clothe myself as decently as I can; I will go in a modish dress,
   I will try the relishes of this, or that, or the other sort of wine."
   "Why, you are an undone creature; you lie under death: what do you wish
   in this case?" "I wish I had as neat and as well-furnished a house as
   my neighbour: I wish that such a commodity would fall, that I might
   have the better time to buy; or that such a commodity would rise, that
   I might have the better time to sell." With things so altogether alien
   from this business, are men taken up in a continual course. What is all
   this to the state of your case? You are under death, man! do you
   understand that? You are under guilt; and by being under guilt, lie
   wider death. And,

   (5.) They seek relief against the miseries of their present state, by
   such things as not only do not afford it, but make their case worse, or
   they have that constant tendency to make them worse. Death that hath
   passed upon all, hath passed upon you:" they are repeatedly told so.
   "Well, what do you think of it?" They have the presumptuous appearances
   of death continually in view: but the inward sense of their heart is
   such as this: "O, that I were a rich man; that I had a great estate;
   that I had but opportunity enough to live a voluptuous life!" or, "Such
   a one hath wronged me; I wish I knew how to be revenged of him!" Men
   think to relieve themselves against what annoys them, and is a part of
   the misery of their present state, by things that would not only be no
   relief, but make their case far worse. For do you think it would mend
   your case, or would you be happier men, and safer from eternal death,
   and from divine justice, that threatens you, or presseth you, if you
   were rich? If you were never so rich, could you thereby redeem your
   souls, and expiate your guilt, and make satisfaction to the justice of
   an offended God? If you could live immersed and swallowed up in
   pleasure and voluptuousness, would that better your case? Would it not
   make it far worse? If you had the revenges you would seek; if you could
   gratify the enmity of your own heart, (which is part of your misery,
   and a great part too,) by making another man miserable also, would that
   mend your case? Nay, would it not increase the guilt? Would it not
   strengthen your bonds, and lay you yet more open to divine displeasure?
   Again, in the last place, though one might multiply instances of this
   kind much further,

   (G.) They are, for the most part, (so far as their external
   circumstances will admit of it,) jocund and merry, and very well
   pleased with their state. How little suitable to this apprehension,
   "Death hath passed over all." We dwell in a world deluged with misery,
   and through which, men are generally making way, and sinking deeper and
   deeper into eternal misery, and into that state wherein death is to be
   consummate, and in its fulness. To have the opportunity (as there are
   none but have very frequently) to hear discourses of men, in whom there
   yet never appeared the least sign or token of repentance or
   reconciliation with God, how jolly and frolicsome they can be, (if, I
   say, their external circumstances can admit it,) would you think these
   men considered themselves as under death, as under a doom from the God
   against whom they have sinned?

   Is it not wondered at, if a condemned crew in chains, and only
   expecting the hour of execution, should be entertaining themselves with
   music and dancing, and pleasant stories? how amazing a thing is this!
   would you not say of such "laughter, it is madness?" and of such
   "mirth, what doeth it?" as the wise man saith, Eccl. ii. 2. Why such
   deportments as these, are they like men perishing, going down to
   perdition? To be pleasant and merry, and not to be reconciled, not yet
   to be at peace with God, to have no security from the wrath to come; to
   have death hanging over a man's head, not as the way to glory, but as a
   doom and curse upon him; and to be jovial and frolicsome under all
   this, would amaze any man that were serious, to consider that it can be
   so! And,

   4. We may further collect, hence, how little it is that principles do
   signify, generally, with men. Though those principles be never so
   common, and never so certain, and evident, yet how little do they
   signify? That the state of man is a sinful and miserable state, is a
   common principle; it is a principle that doth obtain, not only among
   Christians, but among pagans; their writings and books are full of it.
   Most pathetical complaints and lamentations, we frequently meet with,
   in their books, upon this account, speaking of the degenerate state of
   man, and that he is not the creature that at first he was; and speaking
   of his miserable state, and even in a way of nemesis, and as the effect
   of his displeasure, who made him, and hath been offended by him. But
   among Christians, it is so common a principle, that every child that
   hath learned any thing of his catechism, (as I hope you generally do
   catechise your children,) if you but ask them, What is the state of man
   by nature? they will answer, It is a state of sin and misery:--just the
   very meaning of the text: "Death hath passed over all, for that all
   have sinned."

   But how strange is it now, that so common a principle should signify so
   little? and again, that so evident and so certain a principle should
   have so little signification and efficacy with it as a principle? that,
   though the state of man is a miserable state, and that he lies under
   death, is matter of fact, it should have no more effect? Indeed, as to
   the most tremendous part of this death, that is out of sight with many;
   but, for the more sensible part, that lies open to every one's view. It
   can be a doubt with no man, whether he shall die or no. Death passeth
   over all. But how wonderful a thing is it, that a principle, a common
   principle, a most evident principle, and that carries the greatest
   certainty with it imaginable, (as to what at least doth highly deserve
   our consideration,) should be so ineffectual!

   And as to the other part, it is generally professed, and they who make
   it their business, as much as they can, to disbelieve that more
   dreadful part, that remaining and unseen part of this miserable state,
   yet have not conquered the fear of it; if they have conquered the
   belief of it, yet, it is plain, they have not conquered the
   apprehension of it; there is a formido opposito, and cannot but be; for
   at least they know nothing to the contrary; they can never prove the
   contrary, that there is no hell, no judgment to come. And, in a matter
   of this nature, men that would but act according to the common reason
   of men, would think that the matter did need demonstration, that there
   is no such thing, and not run a mad hazard and ad venture; when there
   is nothing lost in the course, to which the truth, in this case,
   (supposing it to be truth,) would lead: and when, by following the
   contrary course, the misery and mischief that must ensue, are both
   unsupportable; and will shortly be irretrievable.

LECTURE XXXIV. [49]

   The remaining Use that I intend, will be only directive.

   1. To such as yet abide in this death, that have passed over all: and
   we have reason to apprehend that to be the case of some: and, 2. To
   those that have, through the grace of God, in good measure, escaped out
   of it,

   1. To the first sort, I have a few things to recommend by way of
   direction. I cannot tell how to apply things to persons particularly:
   that you must do yourselves, as you find it to be with you. But if that
   be the case of any among you, that they have reason to judge so, that
   they abide in this death that have passed upon all, then I would have
   such,

   (1.) To apprehend that this is the common case, and may probably be
   their own, as to that which is most dismal and horrid in this death,
   that hath hitherto passed over this world. It is (as I told you the
   last time) one thing to entertain a truth, as a mere notion in the
   mind, against which we have nothing to say, and to give but a faint
   negative assent to it; to wit, not to dissent or disagree to it: and
   another thing to receive it as a vital and practical principle, that
   influenceth a man's heart, forms his spirit, and governs his course
   accordingly thereunto. And so is this very little apprehended to be the
   common case, that "death hath passed over all." But labour you
   feelingly to apprehend it, as to what is most obvious every way; that
   is, that we are all subject to bodily distempers and diseases, which,
   are tendencies to, and will end in, death: why, about this, we can none
   of us be in any doubt. We are sensibly told it, even in our flesh and
   bones, from day to day. But the worst part of this death is what our
   flesh cannot feel; that is, a death upon our spirits; that our minds
   and hearts are disaffected to God, dead towards God, in direct
   opposition to what the case is with the regenerate, and which they
   ought to be judged and reckoned, as to themselves. "Reckon yourselves
   (saith the apostle, Rom. vi. 11.) dead indeed unto sin, hut alive unto
   God." The death that stands in opposition to this life, is the worst
   and most horrid part of the death that hath passed over this world.

   Labour to apprehend this to be the common case; and then consider,
   whether it be not your own. If the matter do look with a dubious
   aspect, it ought to be considered with so much the more attentiveness,
   and with so much the deeper thoughts. And a slight hope that there is
   an alteration, should not satisfy: and, indeed, you cannot reasonably
   think this to be a little thing, or that it should not be greatly
   considerable. For is it a small matter to have passed from death to
   life? This death passed over all; and an escape out of it, is not so
   little a thing, when you compare those two expressions, 1 John iii. 14.
   "Abiding in death;" and, having "passed from death to life:" it must be
   a most close and pungent question--"Which is my case? Either I have
   passed from death to life; or I continue still in death "And,
   therefore, it ought to be considered over and over, "How stands my case
   towards God? I have a natural life in me, in which I am capable of
   natural actions: but have 1 a holy life in me, by which I am capable of
   the actions that are suitable and proper to that? by which I can act
   and move towards God, not simpliciter or absolute; but quoad hoc: to
   that one end and principle it was made; for there is a deadness, no
   propension towards God, as regeneration would make it alive towards
   God. "How is it with me in this respect?" That ought to be deeply
   considered. "Is not this, the horrid, dismal death that hath passed
   upon all, still upon me?" And,

   (2.) There is this further, that will be suitable by way of direction
   to that former case, to mind those things principally, that are most
   pertinent to it; and to be less concerned about lesser things. And pray
   let such take in this direction: Have you reason to apprehend this to
   be your case; (and a fearful case it is;) that that death, even the
   worst of it, that hath passed over all, remains upon you? Why, then
   think of those things that are most pertinent to that case; and
   consider less the lesser things. As to whatsoever you have to complain
   of besides, say with yourselves, "Aye, but all this is nothing to this
   death that is upon my soul;" and it looks like distraction, when men's
   minds are wholly engaged and taken up about lesser things: but, about
   this greater and more important thing, they have no consideration at
   all. As if one should seem concerned that he hath a scratched finger;
   when he hath a mortal wound in his breast that he is unconcerned for:
   or, that he should have lost a pin, when his house is on fire; or, that
   a man's head should lie easy upon the block, when the fatal stroke is
   just going to be given. For, do but consider what this will come to at
   length: this death will be eternal death. The disinclination and
   deadness of man's spirit towards God, can have no other issue, finally,
   but "Depart from me," if it continue, You are departing from God; you
   will be continually departing: why, Depart from me for ever. This sort
   of death upon the souls of men, it is not a distinct thing from the
   state of hell; it is the same thing begun: there is no further
   difference than between death inchoate, and death consummate. And,
   indeed, every thing that a man doth, and every thing that a man saith,
   is all idle impertinency, while this great thing is neglected. "Seek
   first the kingdom of God and his righteousness," is the advice of our
   Saviour. You are seeking many other things; but have you observed the
   order, to seek that in the first place? Otherwise you have mistaken the
   order. What other things you may lawfully seek, you are then to seek,
   when you have begun duly and regularly, with the first. And, therefore,
   if another should tell you of such and such things that are not so well
   in the state of your case externally: such a man hath failed, that owes
   you money, or the like, you may answer him; "Alas! do not tell me of
   these things, I am dead towards God, what do you tell me of this or
   that? I am like to be lost forever, if grace do not give a speedy help
   to the sad state of my case." And again,

   (3.) Look upon this case of your's as being, though very sad, yet not
   remediless, yet not incurable; look upon it as a remediable case. For
   it is, indeed, all one as to any thing of real gain and advantage, not
   to apprehend your case to be sad, and not to consider it as capable of
   a remedy. Upon the former supposition, there will be no care at all
   exercised about it; and upon the latter supposition there will be no
   hope. But there must be a setting of both these on foot; you must have
   a care about the state of your souls; and you must have hope about it
   too; or else nothing will be done in you, or by you, that will be of
   any value. You should, therefore, consider and bethink yourselves, that
   there is a way of escape out of so great a death; that many have
   escaped you know; and they can think of it with pleasure, and take
   delight in their knowing of God, and conversing with him. Divers that
   have (it may be) spoken to you of such things of God, as you have not
   found in yourselves. But that which hath been, may be: that which you
   see by frequent experience wrought in others, may be wrought in you.
   God, that hath been so rich in mercy to others, why may he not be God,
   rich in mercy to you also?

   Thus you should consider the matter as capable of a remedy. There is a
   word of life sent forth; and there is a Divine Spirit breathing in this
   world; even upon this world that is lost in death: and it hath reached
   many with mighty influences. This is that which ought to be a mighty
   spring of hope to such as will not abandon themselves to despair. Do
   not say concerning yourselves, "There is a death abiding upon my soul,
   and therefore, it must be always so:" for that is to suppose there is
   no difference between earth and hell; between the state of men under
   the gospel, and the state of devils under an eternal doom, in the full
   execution of it.

   I pray consider, our business is not to instruct the inhabitants of
   hell, but to speak to the living on this side the grave. We are
   teaching men, and not devils. And none should put themselves into their
   state and case, as if they had nothing at all to do, but merely to wait
   till the fulness of death should come upon them, and swallow them up.
   Our Lord saith, "Look unto me and be ye saved, all ye ends of the
   earth." And when such a voice as this hath come into this miserable
   earth, no man ought but to look upon himself as concerned therein, as
   well as others; and not to say, "God doth not mean me; he intends no
   such kindness to me:" but rather, on the other hand, to say, "If a
   vital savour hath been diffused with that voice, with that invitation
   of grace, in and by the word, and its vital influences have reached
   many, it may also reach me." There ought to be an expectation raised in
   us, that it may: and many are ruined for not expecting it, not waiting
   at the posts of wisdom's door. Prov. viii. 34, 35. "Blessed is the man
   that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my
   door. For whoso findeth me, findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
   the Lord." This, men ought to set before their eyes, in all their
   attendances upon God, in his ordinances; so that they may be able to
   give this account, if any should ask them, What are you going for?
   "Why, I am going to find life; wisdom saith, They that find me, find
   life. Here I go to seek life for my soul."

   The very order of the divine precept in this thing, is, "Hear, and your
   souls shall live;" which shews with what design men should hear and
   wait upon ordinances. "Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
   waters; come ye buy and eat, yea, come buy wine and milk without money
   and without price, hear and your souls shall live; and I will make an
   everlasting covenant with you." "He hath made with me an everlasting
   covenant, (were David's own dying words) ordered in all things and
   sure; and although my house be not so with God; as to domestical
   concernments things are not so well, yet he hath made with me an
   everlasting covenant; and this is all my salvation, and all my desire."
   Now saith the prophet, in that Isaiah liii. 3. "Do you but incline your
   ear, and hear with expectation that your souls may live, and they shall
   live: and this will tend to bring you into an everlasting covenant,
   even the sure mercies of David." And yet, again,

   (4.) Let me further recommend this to you, to hasten your designed
   escape, without deliberating and pausing long upon the matter. We are
   to look upon this world as deluged by death and wrath, which have
   overspread it, as that sulphureous flood did the valleys wherein Sodom
   and Gomorrah stood; and when Lot was to be saved out of that ruin, in
   mercy to him, for this the angel hastens him, and cries out to him,
   "Escape for thy life." So should you consider the exigency of your case
   not to be less; nay it is incomparably greater. It is not a little
   valley, but it is the world, that is deluged with this sulphureous
   flood. Here is a complication of sin and death overflowing the world;
   and which hath made the world a far worse region than that plain was.
   Now it is said to you; God doth by the voice of his word, and of his
   ministers, say to you, "You are to make haste and escape for your
   life." How many did the fiery flood of Sodom overtake quite! Therefore,
   this case doth not admit of any delay: for how soon this flood may
   overtake you, you know not. It may, so as to overwhelm you quite: and
   so as to make a hopeful case a desperate one. And, therefore, consider
   from hence, in the next place,

   (5.) Of how great importance it is for you to apply yourselves to, and
   gain an interest in, the favour of God. Make from hence an estimate of
   the divine favour, and of the necessity and value of it; for if this be
   your case--Death hath passed over all; if any man thinks of an escape,
   from thence it must come: "What can I do for my soul? How can I fetch
   my soul from that death that is within me; that my soul is ingulphed in
   r" Why, "in his favour is life." There is no hope of life but in his
   favour. Look which way you will, and there is death overwhelming of
   all; and you are no more capable of getting out of this death of
   yourselves, than of touching the heavens with your hand, or seating
   yourselves among the stars in the firmament: therefore, it must be an
   all-favourable, and all-powerful hand, and that too, stretched out from
   heaven, that must save in so distressed a case as this.

   Now how should this recommend to us the favour of God, as that wherein
   our life doth stand, when death hath thus passed over all. If you
   should speak to a neighbour, to a father, to any one that hath the
   dearest affection to you, "O! my soul is in a state of death: how shall
   I get it out of it?" They must all answer, as Jacob did to his wife,
   "Am I in the stead of God, to give thee children? Can I inspire life
   into thy dead soul? No; I cannot do it for thee." This you ought to
   inculcate to yourselves, over and over; that your life stands in the
   divine favour. It is he that breathes into you the breath of spiritual
   life, to make yours become a living soul. They are his kind looks that
   carry life in them. If he will breathe upon your soul, it shall live.
   As that hath been his way, when souls have been wallowing in their
   blood, to look upon them with a kind look, and say unto them--"Live:"
   his look doth carry life in it. He looks life into the soul that is
   dead. As in that xvi. Ezekiel, in the beginning, and towards the latter
   end of that chapter, you will find how the matter ends: "I entered into
   a covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine." He looked upon them in
   their blood, and said unto them--"Live;" and enclosed them in the happy
   bonds of that covenant, that are vital bonds; their souls being bound
   up in the bundle of life. And, therefore,

   (6.) That I may shut up what I shall say to this sort of persons
   concerning that death which hath passed over all, it ought to prepare
   them for the reception of the gospel, wherein are discoveries of the
   divine favour, and the way wherein it reveals itself for the saving and
   renewing of souls lost in death: what a preparative for the gospel
   should this be! To have this in wrought into my soul, that death hath
   passed over all, so amongst the rest, it hath passed over me, involved
   me also. Then how pleasant a sound should the gospel be to lost souls!
   "The Son of man came to seek and save that which was lost." The forlorn
   and distressed estate of this world, hath been compassionately
   considered by the great Lord of heaven and earth; and God hath given
   him life, that he might give eternal life to as many as he hath given
   him. And when men are once prevailed upon, to give themselves to him,
   as the great Prince and Lord of life, who only can deliver them out of
   death, then, it is without question, that God hath given them unto him,
   and it is with that design, that he may give them eternal life. But
   then,

   2. As to those who through grace, have in a good measure made an escape
   out of that death that hath passed over all, it is obvious to
   yourselves, to understand wherein that death stands, which hath passed
   over all, and which you have made your escape from. You know, that part
   of it concerns the outward man; there is no escaping that which is
   equivalent, and more than equivalent. There is an escaping out of it;
   not that such shall not die, but they shall rise again: "their
   corruptible part, (as the apostle saith) shall put on incorruption: and
   their mortal part shall put on immortality; and their vile bodies shall
   be changed and transformed into the likeness of Christ's most glorious
   body.'' There must be a conformity between the Head and the members, so
   that by him they escape not from it, but out of it; emerge, get out of
   that state, that must sooner or later seize upon these mortal bodies.

   But then, for that spiritual death that is, in this present state,
   naturally upon all men's souls, that you have been actually in, that
   you have escaped, that there must bean escape from eternal death. Now
   let me ask you, Have you, through grace, been enabled to escape, in
   good measure, out of the worst of this death that, in the present
   state, men are liable to; to wit, death towards God? Then, if the
   matter be so, there are several things I would recommend to you, and so
   put an end to this discourse.

   (1.) Be much in grateful acknowledgment of God's wonderful mercy; make
   that much the great business of your lives, for it is a great thing God
   hath done for you, in that he hath delivered you from so great a death!
   think what the state and posture of your souls once was God-ward. "Why,
   let me have heard never so much of the most glorious, the most
   excellent of all Beings, in which all the excellencies of all beings
   did meet together, infinite love, and light, and life and purity, and
   holiness; yet, alas! I had no inclination towards him; no desire after
   him; no complacency in him; my soul was as a stone, or stick, or a log,
   without sense, without motion God-ward. I have heard (it may be) of his
   name often; but it never carried a pleasant sound to me. It was no
   pleasure to me, to go and shut up myself in a closet, and pour out my
   soul unto him. As for taking complacency in him as my best Good, so as
   to account him my exceeding great Joy; Alas! I knew not what this
   meant. It was a soul that might have been a stone, as w r ell as a soul
   as to any inclination it had Godward. But, O! blessed be God, that it
   is otherwise! When I hear of that very Sacred Name, it transports my
   soul, to think that All of being, and blessedness, and wisdom, and
   purity, and light, and love, is mine. And if all the world should frown
   on me, and he give me but one smile, it is as life to my soul. Now, the
   very seasons of my convene with him, are as my repasts. What pleasure
   do 1 take when the sabbath is come; when the light of that holy day
   doth dawn upon me! Formerly, I knew not what to design for God. Now my
   end is the glory of God: if I can but speak a good word for his honour
   and interest, it falls in with the inclination of my spirit."

   Why sure, if this be the case with you, it is the most inexcusable
   thing in all the world, that there should be no more of gratitude for
   so great a change wrought in you. Consider that God, in so altering the
   case, hath done that for you, which all the world could not have done.
   Lay all the powers of men on earth, and of all the angels in heaven
   together, they could never have made your hearts to love God, or desire
   after him, or delight in him. But he hath touched your hearts with a
   vital touch, and made them love him. and live to him.

   When the difference is so vast (as I was saying to you lately) between
   abiding in death, and having passed from death to life, (and, whereas,
   every one must be in one of these two states; so that every one must
   say, either "I do abide in death," or "I have passed from death to
   life,") if we, by gracious vouchsafement, are passed from death to
   life, if this be our case, and we are not much in thanksgiving; O! how
   inexcusable is this! And, Christians, I would have you to consider
   this, that this it is which starves religion, and is the reason why,
   where it is, it languisheth; for want of this exercise of thanksgiving.
   And know, that where such praises are ascending to heaven, benedictions
   will be also descending from heaven. Were there more of these
   acknowledgments, how would blessings descend! O! we should be more in
   blessing of God for heavenly things in Christ Jesus; that we should
   have that opportunity, from day to day, of beholding death spreading
   abroad its dark shadows over all the intellectual world, to wit, over
   the minds and spirits of men, and, I was myself a sad instance thereof;
   but God hath delivered me out of this miserable state; O! not to be
   much in thanksgiving, is the most inexcusable temper that can be! But
   again,

   (2.) You ought, hereupon, more to pity the miserable world that is yet
   in death, over which death hath passed, and in which it abides, There
   is altogether a fault among us upon this account; we want bowels, we
   have not compassions, as we ought to have within us, towards perishing
   creatures, "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." It
   is a great evidence of our having obtained mercy, our being merciful in
   this kind. But to be destitute of compassion for the sad case of dead
   souls, is a sad symptom. To say, I have a husband, a wife, a child,
   that are under the power of death, have nothing of the life of God, no
   favour of God, no fear of God, in them; nothing that looks like the
   grace of God; why, not to compassionate them, sure, such a frame as
   this hath in it no indication of divine life springing in us: we see
   them, and converse with them, but seldom have a regretting thought that
   toucheth our hearts: this is, sure, altogether a fault, and knows no
   excuse, admits of none. It argues, at least, a very great languor of
   the divine life in us, when we have so little a sense of so horrid a
   death, as lies upon the generality of the world. Those, in whom this
   divine life doth take place, they are regenerated after God's own
   image: and that must intimate to them to be like minded with him. God
   hath shewed mercy unto us, and, therefore, mercy was his nature, it is
   in the highest perfection in him. If I am transformed after his image,
   I must imitate him in this. If I have nothing of the divine offspring
   in me, how am I his child? And, if I have, why should it not operate in
   me in this kind, in reference to those that were in the same case with
   me, before I obtained mercy. And again,

   (3.) If you have, through the grace of God, in a good degree, escaped
   out of that fearful state of death, which abides generally upon the
   world, make little reckoning in comparison of what you suffer in lower
   kinds, and in lesser respects, whatsoever you have to complain of upon
   other accounts. Let not the sense of lesser evils enter deep into your
   souls. He hath saved you from the greater evils: he delivered you out
   of that so great a death, which overwhelmed you and all the world. It
   is then, very disingenuous to complain of lesser and smaller things,
   when, from the greatest evils of all, he hath saved us. As the apostle
   saith, 2 Tim. i. 9. "Who hath saved us and called us with a holy
   calling." Saved already in a degree, and, by saving us in that degree,
   hath made eternal salvation as sure as if we were in heaven already.
   And therefore, I say, reckon little of these lesser evils that may
   befal you in this present state. And, in the last place,

   (4.) It is very suitable to such, further to consider, that the rest of
   the evils of the world ought not to be considered as strange, when it
   is to be remembered, that a universal death "hath passed over all men.
   That such and such evils should befal in this world, should not be
   thought strange, since this death hath passed over all. We hear of a
   great mortality (it may be) in such a country, and of a great many
   lives cut off in a battle, in another country. There ought to be bowels
   of compassion upon that account; otherwise we have put off humanity.
   But it is a great madness that we should make a greater matter of these
   things, and, at the same time, make nothing of that universal death
   that hath passed over all. Where are our minds, that we do not weigh
   the difference of things? [50]

   I have one thing more, before 1 pass to the doctrine of a Mediator, and
   God's method of saving souls. And I desire to speak to it from another
   text. And that is, to vindicate the justice of God as to this sad and
   calamitous state, that is universal upon mankind, by reason of the
   fall.

JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD,

LECTURE XXXV. [51]

   Psalm li. 4, 5.

   Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
   sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear
   when thou judgest. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my
   mother conceive me.

   HAVING discoursed to you at large from that Rom. v. 12. concerning the
   fall of the first man, and the entrance of sin and death into the
   world, thereupon,! told you in the conclusion of the last discourse on
   that subject, my further intention was to say something for the
   clearing of the Divine Justice, in reference hereunto: and it is a
   debt, a right that we owe to the Supreme Ruler and Lord of all, not
   only to confess his righteousness, but, as occasion serves and
   requires, to vindicate it too. We cannot be just ourselves, if we do
   not, to our utmost, in all things, justify him.

   My design is not, from this scripture, to speak absolutely of the
   corruption and depravedness of the human nature, which I did before,
   from that mentioned scripture. But to speak of it relatively and
   comparatively, in reference to the righteousness of God, or so far as
   that may appear any way concerned in the matter. And indeed, it might
   be thought, there lay before, a very unexceptionable state of the case
   between God and man, in that scripture that I last, and so long
   insisted on; which makes death only to have followed sin into the
   world. And what can be more natural than the connexion of sin and
   death, or the consecution of the latter upon the former, that death
   should only be said to have entered into the world, and to have passed
   over all, inasmuch as all have sinned.

   But men's curiosity doth not rest here, while they will not pretend to
   deny the actual consecution of death upon sin; they make a great deal
   of difficulty to understand how sin should follow upon innocency. And
   here the difficulty is not so great neither, concerning the lapse of
   the first man, and the death following upon that as to him; as also the
   case hath no appearance of difficulty concerning the angels that fell,
   when (as the case was with the first man) every one offended in his own
   person, and so was in his own person to answer for the offence. But
   that that makes the difficulty is, that men should be generally
   involved in sin and ruin, upon the lapse and fall of one, (their common
   parent) when they could not help it that they were his children, or
   that they were born of such progenitors, that all should be undone by a
   fault which they could not prevent, and unto which they had no
   accession.

   This difficulty hath cast divers men upon distressing thoughts. Some
   have thereupon denied the corruption and depravity of human nature; and
   they might as well deny that there are men upon earth. Some would have
   the souls of men (the only capable subjects of sin) to be propagated as
   the bodily part is, which would hazard the doctrine of their
   immortality. Others have had their other conjectures, which I shall not
   mention.

   But, upon the whole, we ought not only to censure with indulgence, but
   to commend and praise the spirit and practice of such, in reference to
   this matter, as have, with sincere and unbiassed minds, set their
   understandings on work, how best to maintain high and honourable
   thoughts of God; that have been studious to find out, or apt to
   entertain any hypothesis that might be more suitable unto that. This (I
   say) is not only to be censured indulgently, but to be commended very
   highly, provided that men do not, herein, run counter to express Divine
   Revelation and unto uncontrolable experience. And that they be not so
   over-officious as to affix characters upon the blessed God, under the
   name of perfections belonging to his nature, which do not truly or
   really so belong, and which he never owned or claimed as such.

   It is very plain, that this holy Psalmist had seen through this
   difficulty, he saw with better eyes than the most; more sincere, less
   malevolent; and had digested the matter in his thoughts, otherwise he
   would never have laid down these two things thus together as we find,
   "That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when
   thou judgest. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my
   mother conceive me." He, at least, thought these things very agreeable
   with one another, if rather, he did not bring in the latter as a proof
   and demonstration of the former, which the demonstrative particle
   prefixed (Behold) would lead one to think,

   But let us., first, view the words a little in themselves, and we shall
   discern the schesis and reference to one another, a little better
   thereby, afterwards. That which is here, in this place, rendered
   actively, is in the iii. chapter to the Romans, rendered passively,
   that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and overcome when thou
   judgest;" there it is, "when thou art judged," as we read it, the
   septuagint being followed (as frequently it is) by the apostle. But I
   cannot apprehend (as some do note) any need of a different reading in
   the letter of either text, as some critics take notice, the Hebrew
   affix being set as there it is, may indifferently be read, either
   actively or passively. And so may the Greek word, as is most evident,
   and so we may render either place, either way; and all will come to one
   and the same sense; that God may appear just, that his justice may be
   triumphant and victorious, whether it be when he judgeth; or when men
   judge and censure him, and his proceedings.

   And so the current of this discourse of the Psalmist will be plain and
   clear: "I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me;
   against thee only have I sinned: that thou mayest be justified when
   thou speakest"--that is, referring to the 3 verse, "I acknowledge." (as
   here I do,) then the acknowledgment follows, "that thou mayest be
   justified." "I make my acknowledgments so and so, that thou mayest be
   justified when thou speakest, or mayest overcome when thou judgest, or
   when men presume or take upon them to censure thy proceedings towards
   me; though thou shouldest proceed with all the severity that thou hast
   threatened by the prophet sent unto me: for not only have I done this
   particular evil against thee, and in thy sight, but I have been an
   impure creature, even from my own original: thou hast much against me,
   not only for this single instance, but as I came a sinful polluted
   creature into the world: I was shapen in iniquity, formed, turned
   therein; as soon as I grew warm in the womb, (as the word signifies) so
   soon sin did insinuate into my very praemordia, into the very
   principles of my being."

   And to the same purpose is this passage quoted by the apostle, in that
   mentioned Romans iii. 4. for when he had been charging sin, before,
   upon all the world, on the Gentiles, in the i. chapter, and on the
   Jews, in the ii. he only puts a question in the beginning of the iii.
   chapter, "What advantage then hath the Jew, if all be found equally
   under sin?" And he only admits them to have an advantage in order to
   their recovery, but none at all as to their degeneracy. In reference to
   their recovery they had a great advantage, inasmuch, as to them were
   committed the Oracles of God, the discovery of his counsel and way for
   the reconciling and saving lost sinners. But he considers nothing, in
   reference to what he had asserted of their part and share in the common
   depravation and apostasy; they were as bad as the best.

   Then he immediately lays down what is quoted from the Psalmist, and
   makes that his scope and mark in all the rest of the chapter, that is,
   to justify God; that he might be justified, and overcome in all his
   pleadings and judgings: or when man should implead or take upon him to
   censure God, that still his justice might be victorious and triumphant.
   This is the mark, that he aims at manifestly, in all his following
   discourse; shewing at large, the universal depravation and corruption
   of human nature every where; having proved (as he saith at the 9th
   verse) concerning both Jews and Gentiles (which did then divide the
   world) that they were all under sin.

   Indeed, the immediate subjoining of this unto the mention of the design
   in this psalm, seems to carry this aspect with it, that the Psalmist
   intended to speak or introduce the mention of this depravedness and
   corruption of human nature, (even as It was in himself) as a proof and
   evidence of the divine justice, as that which might tend to clear it so
   much the more. But at least, it must he collected from his subjoining
   the mention of the latter to the former, that he looked upon them as
   very consistent, and very reconcileable things, as things that carried
   no repugnancy in them to one another. And even this, will serve my
   present purpose and design. So that all which I shall observe from this
   context, and the connexion of these two, herein, shall be this,--

   That it is very consistent with the justice of God, and very
   reconcileable to it, most reconcileable to it, that men, born of human
   parentage, do universally come into this world impure and polluted
   creatures, even from the womb.--

   The Psalmist did not so much as imagine (you may see) an inconsistency
   between the corruption of nature in man, and the justice of God, in
   that he so lays them down by one another. Surely (thinks he) these
   cannot quarrel, no man can reasonably think they will; they are to be
   looked upon, and ought to be looked upon, as sociable truths, that can
   agree well together, even these two, that man from the womb is an
   impure, sinful creature: and God is everlastingly and immutably a holy
   and righteous God.

   Now, in speaking to this, I shall reduce all that I intend, unto a
   Four-fold Conclusion. And shall gather up all, under these four; As,

   I. There can be no real opposition between truth and truth. And so,
   that whatsoever we are convinced of is truth, another truth that we are
   equally as certain of, cannot be opposite thereunto. If there be any
   such appearance, it is but a false appearance, it is only a seemingness
   of opposition and contrariety, but really there can be no such thing.
   And,

   II. That we may be most certain, that many things are, when, how they
   are, or come to be as they are, is by us unexplicable and
   unaccountable. And,

   III That it would be very unreasonable to oppose and object dubious and
   uncertain things, against what is sure and plain, and most certain.
   And,

   IV. That it will be, especially, most unreasonable to oppose uncertain
   to certain things, when there are many considerations capable of being
   alleged that will break the force of such objections. But nothing can
   be alleged to shake the certainty and firmness of the foresaid truths.
   Then it will be most of all unreasonable.

   Unto these four conclusions, I shall reduce what I intend, and what 1
   think reasonable to be said to this matter.

   I. That truth can never be opposite to truth: and that therefore, what
   things we are most certain of as true, they can lie in no opposition to
   one another. But whatsoever of such appearance there may be, must be a
   false appearance. I instance, here, in these two things, that we are
   concerned to reconcile,--the perfection of the Divine Nature
   (comprehending his justice) and--the sinful imperfection and pravity of
   the human nature. These are both most certain truths; and, therefore,
   it is impossible they can be really opposite to one another.

   1. The absolute perfection of the Divine Nature, comprehending his
   justice, which must be one great perfection be longing thereunto. It is
   that indeed which, by the ducture of the text, we are principally
   concerned to vindicate, and so we re, indeed, any divine perfection
   against which the doctrine afterwards assented may seem to militate.
   Everyone will grant, that acknowledgeth a God, that justice must be a
   perfection belonging to his nature. And we may, these two ways, be most
   absolutely ascertained hereof.

   (1.) That whatsoever doth belong to God, belongs to him essentially:
   his nature can receive no additions nor diminutions, and consequently
   is immutably so; can no more cease to be so, than he can lie, or do any
   ill thing; nor this, more than he can cease to be; because all
   perfection (and that of justice among the rest) belongs unto him
   essentially. So that he can no more cease to be just, than cease to be
   God. And,

   (2.) Of this we may be ascertained further, thus, that where as,
   justice is a virtue inclining a person to give to every one his due,
   that which is owing to him, rightly belongs to him, God cannot be a
   debtor to his creature, otherwise than by voluntary obligation that he
   takes upon himself. No one can be a debtor to another but one of these
   two ways; either naturally, or by some other sort of contract. He is,
   indeed, naturally a debtor who is possessed of somewhat that doth
   belong to another, that was originally his, and to which he retains a
   right: a man is in this case naturally a debtor to such a one by the
   immediate law of nature, to give him his own, or a full equivalent that
   he shall be satisfied is so. But so it is altogether impossible that
   God can be a debtor to his creature, who, (as the apostle speaks, upon
   another account, xvii. Acts,) hath given to all life and breath, and
   all things. They can be proprietors of nothing, in opposition to him or
   against him, that are not masters of themselves, or of their own being.
   They owe him their all; to them there can be owing nothing; that is,
   not from him, to whom they themselves owe their very all. It is a just
   challenge, therefore, that is given to all the world by the apostle;
   Rom. xi. 35. "Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
   unto him again?" Produce me the man that can say, "God is a debtor,
   that he hath given him this or that, for which he is owing to him, let
   any man produce his claim, and it shall be recompensed to him again."
   So that, naturally, God cannot be a debtor to his creatures.

   And then, if we speak of the second way of his being a debtor, God hath
   never obliged himself to keep sin out of the creation, so as that he
   should break with his creatures, and do them wrong, in not doing all
   that was possible to omnipotency to make them impenable. Shew the
   obligation, produce the bond, Where is it? If this were to be alleged,
   Be broke with his reasonable creatures at first, in making them free,
   in infecting liberty into their natures: why he never laid himself
   under any obligation against this. And therefore, it is every way most
   evident, that God must be immutably and unalterably just in all his
   dispensations; and particularly in this, in not hindering that sin
   should come into the world, and draw death after it, and spread itself
   through the world, (as we find it hath done,) still drawing on, and
   attracting death. And,

   2. On the other hand, it is a most clear and certain truth, that as the
   nature of God is most absolutely and unalterably perfect, including all
   perfection, and that of justice unalterably among the rest; so, the
   nature of man is, in this present state, and from the very original of
   individual persons, sinfully imperfect; and they come into the world
   impure and polluted creatures from the womb. The justice of God is not
   to be solved that way, by denying that there is such a corruption and
   depravity of nature, transmitted even with the nature of man itself
   from age to age, as therein is comprehended both a negative part, a
   disinclination to all good; and a positive, an inclination to all evil.
   And that this also may be in our minds as a certain truth, I shall
   insist a little, and but a little, upon it. It not being my design (as
   I said) to do what hath been already done, to insist purposely upon the
   corruption of human nature absolutely, but only relatively and
   comparatively, according to what reference this matter may bear to the
   righteousness of God's dealings with men. And to evince this,

   (1.) It is the most plain and express language of the Scripture. And
   what ought to determine in such a case? what could determine us but
   that? There is not another tolerable sense to be put on these words, "I
   was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me." It is
   most unreasonable and absurd, to pretend this to be only a particular
   acknowledgment of David concerning himself: as if he had the most
   unhappy procreation of all mankind; as if there were more corruption,
   or another way to convey corruption to him from his parents, than was
   with all the rest of men. It can carry no meaning, but that he doth
   involve his own in the common case, that it was only with him, in this
   respect, as it is with all others, that they are, (as the expression is
   in John ix. 34,) altogether born in sin, all unclean. And it was,
   therefore, impossible that any thing clean should come out of them. t(
   Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one." And you have
   the same thing more expressly asserted in general terms, in the lviii.
   psalm; "The wicked are estranged from the womb, they go astray as soon
   as they are born, speaking lies." And sure, every man is wicked till he
   is converted, till he be regenerate and turn to God. Therefore, it must
   be an affirmation concerning all mankind, that they are estranged from
   the very womb, averse and disaffected to every thing that is good; and
   propense to that which is evil, as the following words signify: they go
   astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies; made up of falsehood,
   even from their original. And,

   (2.) The Scripture doth, in multitudes of places, speak of the
   universal actual sinfulness of the world: and whence should that come?
   In that iii. chapter of Romans, how often it is inculcated. I have
   proved (saith the apostle) Jews and Gentiles to be all under sin: and
   they were all the world. And all have sinned and come short of the
   glory of God; (afterwards in the same chapter 19,) and, that every
   mouth may he stopped, and all the world become guilty before God. Now,
   this being plainly asserted in the word of truth, how should this
   actual sinfulness begin with every one, so as to be universal? If it
   were only by imitation and example, it is strange that all should
   imitate the sin, but none follow the better examples, which, when
   renewing grace hath done its work, do come to be extant and appear in
   view, so as that many do carry it (through the grace of God) without
   visible scandalous enormities. But that which is so universally common,
   must have some common cause. The reason of the thing speaks itself:
   when there is not an instance to be found of any one that hath lived
   without sin, how should this be, but that it hath and must have sprung
   up with them? must have come with their nature, their very nature
   itself? for it is as common as their nature. And we may,

   (3.) Argue from experience, that such a corruption and pravity as this,
   doth spring up with men and all human creatures, that come into this
   world, the ordinary way: that is, we cannot name the time when such are
   capable of acting electively or rationally, but they are of acting
   sinfully as soon. Doth not every one's experience tell him so? That
   there are disinclinations to that which is good, and inclinations to
   that which is evil, appearing most early; peevishness, crossness,
   pride, strife, falsehood, a disposition to lie, to be revengeful and
   vindictive; nothing is plainer; so that to deny the pravity of nature,
   even from men's primordia, is all one, as to say there are not such
   natures in being. And then,

   (4.) We may argue, too, from the manifest subjection and liableness of
   infants, even in their infancy, unto punitive strokes; sickness, pains,
   and death itself. Wherein is this, that the infant age is not exempt,
   if it be innocent, if it hath nothing of impurity and pravity adhering
   to it? If here it be said by way of reply to this, that "we find the
   inferior creatures, brute creatures are liable to the same thing;
   sickness, and pain, and death, but that doth not prove them to be
   sinful, or that they have any sinfulness adhering to them;" why the
   case is so manifestly different, that it is an easy matter for the
   objector, if he please, (whosoever he be,) to answer himself. It is
   plain, death was never a threatening to them: it is plain that the
   brute creatures, as they grow up, do not come to sin at last, they
   never sin, nor are ever capable of it. And if, therefore, it should be
   said, that such infirmities, ails, maladies and mortality itself, are
   afflictions only, and not penalties, I would fain know whether that do
   not equally reflect upon the divine justice, (of which such do seem to
   be so tender,) and a great deal more, to afflict a creature which is at
   the same time asserted to be innocent, every way innocent; doth not
   carry a worse face, a worse aspect with it, than to assert this
   creature to be nocent? And to say, these things are not punitive, but
   afflictive, is but a notional difference; and the notion doth neither
   do them good nor harm; neither makes the affliction less or more. But
   sure, it is more honourable for God to say, that, observing the impure
   and depraved state of human nature, even from its very original, he
   animadverts upon that impurity. As why should not the holy God express
   a displeasancy with every impurity wherever he finds it? And no man
   accuseth another of any injustice if he do destroy a creature as soon
   as it begins to live, that is known to be noxious, hurtful and
   mischievous; as the crushing of serpents in the very egg; when this is
   so apparent, that there are so noxious qualities, which there is
   nothing but want of opportunity and time that hinders their exertion in
   noxious and hurtful acts. To express a displeasancy towards the innate
   disposition, can be no way unworthy of God. But that we shall have
   occasion to speak of more hereafter.

   In the mean time, this is the First Head proposed--that truth cannot be
   opposite to truth.--And therefore, we being ascertained of this twofold
   truth, that God is most perfectly and unalterably just, and that man is
   sinfully imperfect and impure, from his original, that is, the original
   of the individuals, these two cannot be opposite to one another: one
   truth cannot destroy another truth, or impart any repugnancy thereunto.
   And therefore, if there be any appearance of contrariety between these
   two, it must be but a false appearance. For of these things we are most
   certain; they are undoubted truths. There fore, to solve the
   phenomenon, we must look another way, and there will be opportunity for
   that, in speaking to the following conclusions. In the meantime, let
   these two things be inlaid deeply in our souls, that God is absolutely
   and every way perfect, so as that, that perfection of his must include
   the most unalterable eternal righteousness and justice; but that we for
   our parts are, from our original, impure and polluted creatures, that
   there may be, accordingly, suitable dispositions in us to acknowledge
   and adore his righteousness: and to own and abhor our own impurities:
   to walk humbly in the sense of them as long as we live, and to have so
   much the more disposition to admire that grace, which hath its exercise
   towards such creatures as we, when in point of justice there was enough
   against us to have produced, for ever, all the exercises of such grace.

LECTURE XXXVI. [52]

   II. Now I go on to the next conclusion, which is the second in order,
   namely--That we may be most certain that many things really are, when
   the manner how they are, or how they came to be, is not understood by
   the most, or may be of very difficult explication unto any--And to
   accommodate this to the present purpose I shall proceed by steps.

   1. It is very plain that there is a cloud and darkness gene rally
   sitting upon, or a veil is generally drawn over the inceptions of
   things of whatsoever kind, as to how things of any sort, do take their
   first beginnings. It is observable that, usually, a veil is drawn over
   those things. Look into all the productions of nature, how things do
   take their first rise, it is generally very inexplicable, and very
   unconceivable, at least as to the generality. For such substantial
   beings as are most sensible to us, as we see with our eyes, or touch
   with our hands; so that there can be no place or room for any doubt,
   but that such things are; yet how they came to be, who can give an
   account? We can none of us be in doubt but there are really these
   heavens over our heads, which our eyes see from day to day; and this
   earth underneath us, which we may touch when we please. But if God had
   not given us a general account of the Genesis, of the beginning of the
   heavens and the earth, at what a loss would men have been every where?
   And at what a loss generally are they, how man himself began to be in
   this world, where they have not the ducture of Revelation in the case,
   to assist and help them? To think what ridiculous accounts, some of the
   wise and learned philosophers of this world have given of the very
   inception of mankind, it shews there is a veil, especially over the
   beginnings of things, when of the things themselves, there is the
   greatest certainty imaginable. As who can make any man doubt whether
   there be such heavens as we behold, or such an earth as we walk upon,
   though we should never have known, if God had not told us, how they
   began. And to go a little further,

   2. We are most certain of many acts; and abilities and dispositions
   thereunto; which actions, how they are performed, very few can give an
   account; and where the dispositions thereunto did arise, they can as
   little tell. We know that we can see with our eyes, and that we can
   hear with our ears; and that such actions are performed by those very
   organs that are used for these purposes. But how few can tell how this
   act of vision is performed, or can give an account of the structure of
   that organ of the eye by which it is performed? And so, how the action
   of hearing is done, and of the aptitude of the organ of the ear
   thereunto? But we certainly know that we see, and that we hear; and
   that we see with our eyes, and not with our hands; and hear with our
   ears, and not with our feet.

   And so, for acts of understanding; we know that we do know; we know,
   and are certain that we do exert acts of reason, that we use thoughts,
   but who can tell how a thought arises in a man's mind, and how men come
   to have the seeing, and hearing, and speaking, and reasoning power and
   faculty transmitted from age to age, and from generation to generation?
   That there should arise still from age to age such a sort of creatures
   as have these faculties and powers belonging to them, of that we can
   give as little account, as how grass, and herbs, and flowers do spring
   up of their proper seeds upon this earth, from year to year. But of the
   things themselves, we have the greatest certainty that may be. And to
   proceed further,

   3. Concerning sinful acts and dispositions, we can be in as little
   doubt that such things there really are, though there be here a greater
   difficulty how they came to be. It is true, that this question vexed
   some of the wisest, and most learned, and most considering of mankind;
   before Christianity took place among them; since there was nothing but
   what was good at first, how should there come to be any such thing as
   evil in the world? And indeed, the counsel given, was wise and whole
   some, rather to consider how sin may be got out of the world, than how
   it came into it. But there is a necessity upon us, to endeavour, to our
   utmost, the maintaining and keeping up high and honourable thoughts of
   God, as that upon which all religion depends, and without which, men
   will have a pretence to let it vanish out of the world; yea, and
   endeavour to make it so to do,

   But whatsoever difficulty we may suppose in this case, the matter of
   fact is plain and evident; that is, we do find that there is such a
   generation of creatures, that do spring up in the world, from age to
   age, that are together both reasonable and sinful, as they could not be
   the latter without being the former. This is plain matter of fact, that
   a sort of creatures, which do exercise reason, do also sin from age to
   age, and universally: and that this, their disposition to sin, and
   their actual sinning, must have a beginning: and it cannot have
   beginning, but from some common and universal cause, being itself
   universal; so as that there are no instances to be found where (if
   there be an opportunity) a disposition to sin, doth not betray itself;
   so as that men are not more inclined to act rationally, than they are
   to act irregularly. They act rationally in many instances, they act
   irregularly in greater instances, and more important, and that
   constantly, in all times, and all parts of the world. This is plain
   matter of fact; and men do, therefore, fill their own souls, and fill
   the world, with confusions and miseries.

   This (I say) is all plain matter of fact. We cannot be more certain of
   any thing, than we are of this; that is, that men have so much reason
   still remaining, and belonging to their nature, as by which they are
   capable of knowing they were not self-made, not self-originate, that
   they came from another, that they owe then? all to an infinitely
   perfect Being; that must have all perfection in itself, and all being
   originally in itself, and that their interests are someway or other
   involved within one another. And they are, thereupon, capable of
   understanding their own obligation to love God above all; and to love
   one another as themselves. Very plain it is, if men did but act
   pursuantly to such apprehensions, whereof it is most apparent their
   nature is capable, they would pass their days, here in this world, in
   very great tranquillity and felicity, within themselves, and towards
   one another; and, that it is impossible that those miseries, and those
   evils and confusions which fill men's spirits, and fill the world,
   should arise from anything else but the inclination that is in them to
   do otherwise; not to love God with a supreme love, and not to love one
   another with co-ordinate love. So that this is as plain matter of fact,
   as that there is a world, or that there are reasonable creatures in it.
   This hath always been a difficulty, how (as to some particular persons
   especially) sin should have its beginning, when that it hath its
   continual being in the world proves itself to every one's sad
   experience and observation, that doth but take notice of himself and
   the world. But yet,

   4. Though, how sin is transmitted to particular and individual persons,
   from generation to generation, it cannot be so easily told, yet it may,
   most certainly, be determined how it is not (which most concerns us
   with reference to our present purpose, to vindicate the righteousness
   of God) that is, that it is man's creature, and not God's. It is not he
   that hath infused any thing of evil or malignity into the nature of
   man, which was originally pure and perfect as it sprang from him, the
   Author of all nature. This is out of question, that he made man
   upright, but they have sought and found many inventions. Eccl. vii. 29.
   This appears, by what that great man, Moses, saith to the people, over
   whom God had made him a leader and a head, when he was now shortly to
   take his leave of them; in that much celebrated song which he begins
   with this, as the design of publishing the name of the Lord, "Because I
   will publish the name of the Lord, ascribe ye greatness unto our God:"
   (that, we may take up and accommodate very fully to our own, that is to
   the common case.) "He is the rock (this is a part of that name of his
   which he designed to publish in that xxxii. Deut.) his work is perfect,
   and all his ways are judgment, a God of truth and without iniquity,
   just and right is he." But "they have corrupted themselves:" (as in the
   4 and; 5 verses of that chapter, and onward:) a self-corrupted
   generation of creatures they are. And concerning this, we may as sure
   our hearts; and ought to do so.

   When we are in this case to apologize for God, it is indeed an awful
   thing that is undertaken; but with the profoundest reverence, and with
   the greatest veneration, and with a deep resentment of the necessity
   that men should be so prone to arraign the Almighty: and he be (as it
   were) put to plead his cause at his own creatures' bar; as the
   apostle's reading of the words doth imply; and as the former part, even
   of that clause in the 4 verse of this psalm is understood to signify
   too: That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest; when thou
   speakest by way of apology for thyself. It ought to be done with a
   sincere design, and with a joyful confidence, that he will always
   overcome and triumph when he judgeth himself, and when men presume to
   judge him, and pass their censures upon his ways and methods towards
   the world.

   But it is a thing must be done, because there is a proneness in men's
   minds to admit of, and to have thoughts arise and spring up in them
   which have a reflecting aspect and look, upon the Most High, and Most
   Righteous God. As you see, the apostle, in the place where he quotes
   this text, (Romans iii. 4, 5.) objects this; "Is God unrighteous, who
   taketh vengeance?" when he was, in the foregoing and following
   chapters, proving Jew and Gentile to be all under sin. ".Is God
   unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? I speak as a man," humano more,
   after the manner of men, which implies, so men are apt to speak; that
   is, to raise questions and doubts in their own minds, "How will this or
   that stand with the righteousness of God?" Therefore, the apostle
   thought himself concerned to vindicate God's righteousness; and he doth
   it largely, even there in that mentioned chapter, and afterwards in
   several others of that epistle; and it ought to be done with a pleasant
   confidence that there will be an universal applause to the
   righteousness of God at last, by all his intelligent creatures; that
   all shall agree and conspire together, in saying, "Holy and true art
   thou O Lord; just and righteous art thou Lord God Almighty, thou King
   of nations and of saints."

   This I thought fit to say, by way of introduction to what I have
   further to say to this last mentioned head, that while we may be in
   some difficulty, how corrupt nature conies to be propagated from man to
   man, and from age to age, we are yet at a certainty how it is not done;
   that is, that sin is none of God's creature, and that he never infuses
   a sinning disposition into any creature whatsoever. The belief of this
   we ought to establish and settle in our own hearts, as that by which we
   shall but give God his due, and consult our own peace, and more
   flourishing and prosperous state of religion in our own souls; that it
   may have no damps there, or nothing that may tend to extinguish or
   deaden it in us. And therefore, this I shall evince to you, by some
   plain considerations; though one would think, indeed, the thing needed
   no eviction. As,

   (1.) That the purity of God's nature cannot but abhor it: it is
   impossible that a thing so repugnant as sin is to the pure and holy
   nature of God, can spring from that pure and holy nature. Nothing but
   what is good can come from the first, the original, the essential, the
   most perfect Good. And,

   (2.) That which he hath forbidden, it is impossible that he should
   cause or procure; that would be such a contradiction as we could never
   suspect an honest man of, that he should for bid and procure the same
   thing.

   (3.) Much less is it possible that he should cause that which he
   punisheth, and punisheth with so terrible severity; the proper wages of
   sin being no less than eternal death. And,

   (4.) It is impossible he should cause that which he hates; "Do not the
   abominable thing which I hate, which my soul hateth." Of that he can
   never be the Author and the Cause. And,

   (5.) It can never be, that he should be the Cause or Author of that,
   which is so highly injurious to him, which doth him the greatest injury
   imaginable. For though, from the perfection of his own nature, it is
   impossible it should do him any real harm; yet it doth him the greatest
   wrong. What a disorder hath it introduced into the creation of God! how
   hath it spoiled his workmanship, in a great master-piece of his
   creation, the mind and soul of man made after his image! What deformity
   hath it introduced in the room of so much beauty and glory! How
   manifest an attempt is it against his throne, even in the very nature
   of it! What a violation of the sacred constitution of his government!
   It is sin that hath set his own creatures against him, disaffected it
   to him: that is, in itself, in its rooted aversion from God, and hatred
   of God. It is the most unconceivable thing in the world, that God
   should make his own nature hate himself, disaffect himself. It is sin
   that hath actually torn away so great and noble a part of his creation
   from him, and plucked it from his obedience and subjection; even all
   the generations of men from age to age, and so great a part of the
   heavenly host, and turned them all into rebels against their Maker and
   Rightful Lord. It cannot be that he should cause so mischievous a
   thing.

   And it is too faint a vindication of God, in this case, to say, that
   therefore, he cannot cause, because it is a defect, and so not a
   causable thing, or capable of any other but a deficient cause. This is
   very true indeed, but very short, for that is no more than to say, God
   caused it not, than to say, another caused it not; as a thing that
   cannot be caused, cannot indeed admit of positive causation. That is
   very true, but we do not do God right if we do not assert also, that he
   could not bring it about, that it should be any agency of his; not in
   respect of the object as being an uncausable thing, but in respect of
   his own nature, as being repugnant to his holiness, and to his
   sovereignty, and to the sacredness of his government. And as that which
   he could not but abhor from, and hate, and hate with utmost
   detestation. Arid I add to all this,

   (6.) To evince that this transmission of sin, cannot be by any direct
   hand that God hath in it, in that he hath provided so costly a remedy
   against it, that he should cause that which his own Son came down into
   our world, and died to destroy. That so wonderful a thing should be, as
   his descent into this world of ours, "who was the brightness of his
   Father's glory, and the express image of his person, and who upholds
   all things by the word of his power, and by whom he made the worlds;"
   that he should come down and appear once before the end of time, (or
   upon the declining of time from its fulness,) to put away sin by the
   sacrifice of himself; (Heb. ix. 25.) that he who sent his own Son to
   put away sin upon so very expensive terms, by the sacrifice of himself,
   to throw it out of the world, should have a hand in bringing it into
   the world, is the most inconceivable thing that can be.

   And it is that which all agree in, that however sin came into the
   world, God was not the Author of it. Every one abhors that thought, men
   of all sorts, of all persuasions and religions: pagans themselves, in
   all the descriptions we find in their writings concerning original
   evil, all agree in this, that God is not the Original of it: all agree
   to discharge God in the case, though they are put (some of them) upon
   most absurd imaginations and devices to assoile the matter in
   themselves; and to avoid one difficulty, run themselves into as great
   or greater. Some talking, they know not what, of a certain ancient
   nature, from whence evil must come: some positively asserting two
   principles, as Manes and his manicheans did, an evil principle, and a
   good. But this, all have agreed in, by common consent, that God could
   not be the Author of the sinful evils that have, in so great measure,
   confounded the world, and spoiled and corrupted the nature of man.

   And that being so far clear, we may reckon, that a good step is taken
   towards the mark that we are aiming at, the vindicating of God's
   righteousness in reference to this thing. There is the greatest
   certainty imaginable of the thing itself, while we are uncertain of the
   manner how sin comes to be transmit ted from age to age, or to take its
   beginning in particular persons in a continual succession. Though there
   be (I say) a difficulty as to that, there is no difficulty as to the
   thing; and there is no difficulty as to this, how it did not, though it
   remain still a difficulty, how it is. It is not from God, sin is none
   of his creature.

   Then I should here subjoin, in the third place, that next conclusion
   which I design to speak to, namely,

   III. That it is the most unreasonable thing that can be, to object
   uncertainty against certainty. It being certain, that God is immutably
   holy and righteous, and that his nature is absolutely perfect; it being
   certain that man's nature is now become sinfully imperfect: and it
   being again plain, that we may be certain of very many things, when how
   they come to be, is doubtful, and perhaps, to many or the most
   inexplicable: but as to this particular thing, we do not know how the
   corruption of particular persons began, but we know how it began not;
   that is, that it is impossible to be any way imputable to God: we
   thence proceed to shew, how unreasonable a thing it is, to object the
   things about which we are uncertain, against the things that are most
   certain, that carry the greatest and plainest evidence with them. And
   of this we may give you instances enough.

   If we should argue against the existence of this world, be cause we
   have not a particular, distinct account how it took its beginning, how
   absurd were it? If we may be capable of being puzzled with such
   questions as these, the great God put to Job. (chapter 38. in several
   verses of it.) If he should bid us gird up our loins like men, and say
   he would demand of us, to answer, "Where were you when I laid the
   foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding, Who hath
   laid the measures thereof, if ye know? or who hath stretched out the
   line upon them?" If he should expostulate with us, touching our
   knowledge of the way, how the sea is shut up as within bars and doors;
   or how ice, and snow, and rain are generated, and would put us upon
   giving an account of these things, would it not be the absurdest thing
   in all the world to deny their being, because we cannot give a distinct
   account of them? If we cannot give a distinct account, (or it may be,)
   a satisfactory one to ourselves, how matter was moved yet in the
   unformed chaos, and when the measuring line was stretched forth of this
   world, and the foundations laid of this mighty work; if we cannot give
   an account, how light and darkness were severed; which was the parting
   place, the utmost boundary of light and darkness; if we cannot give an
   account how the waters of the sea came to be collected and gathered
   into one place, and to be confined and shut up there, so as not to
   return and overflow the earth; if we cannot give an account how the
   rain was generated by its father: "Hath the rain a father? (as it
   follows here:) how ice and snow came to be condensed into these several
   substances, wherein we find them; therefore, to say that none of these
   things are; to oppose the uncertainties about the production of these
   things, to the manifest undoubted certainty of their existence, is
   certainly such an absurdity as we could never prevail upon ourselves to
   be guilty of.

   But (as hath been told you before) we cannot be more certain of any
   thing that we see with our eyes, or of any faculty or power that
   belongs to ourselves, than we are, that there is a continual
   transmission of sin in this world, We cannot be more certain that man
   is a seeing creature, that he is a hearing creature, that he is a
   reasoning creature, than we can, that he is a living creature. And it
   would therefore, be the most absurd thing imaginable, to oppose and
   object that which is uncertain, against that which is so plainly and
   fully certain. And I might tell you here, of a great many
   uncertainties, which they must suppose and take for granted to be very
   great certainties, who should form a disputation in this case,
   concerning the production of the corrupt and sinful nature in man. But
   that would be too large a theme to enter upon now. Yet, all will
   resolve into this in general, that as to what difficulty men do imagine
   in this case, it is only from their opposing philosophical uncertainty,
   to theological verity; and tilt philosophers he agreed, in other
   matters, we have very little reason to regard problems, doubtful
   problems, that may refer to this particular case; of which 1 may
   instance at another time, but shall not now. But (I say) let them come
   to a certainty in other matters first, before they expect to be much
   regarded in reference to determinate, theological truth, which we
   reckon, stands unshaken as the foundations of heaven and earth. When
   they have brought themselves and the world to a certainty about such
   things as the ebbing and flowing of the sea, the causes of the very
   centre of our world, the powers of the loadstone; whether it be the sun
   or the earth, and which it is of these that moves the other about; when
   they have brought such things as these, and a hundred more that might
   be mentioned, to a certainty, then, they may, with more pretence,
   expect to be listened to, as to their determinations which may more
   directly respect this case.

LECTURE XXXVII. [53]

   Under the opening of the third conclusion, proposed to be spoken to,
   for the clearing of what I intended in the choice of the text we are
   upon, namely,--that it is most unreasonable and absurd, to oppose and
   object dark, and doubtful, and uncertain things, against that which is
   most evident and certain;--we shewed that there are many uncertainties,
   that men of philosophical minds, and geniuses, do commendably enough
   employ their thoughts about, while they do not attempt or offer at such
   a thing, as to oppose them to manifest, revealed truths. But if they
   will do so, it is, in all reason, to be expected that they should come
   to a more general certainty than they do, or are ever like to do, about
   philosophical matters in general. I instanced in several, and told you,
   I would instance in four more which do more directly concern this case,
   about which, here lies the objected difficulty.

   That the human soul cannot he propagated: to suppose it can, would he
   to expose the doctrine of its immortality, to manifest hazard. It must
   be supposed, that being immediately created by God himself, it comes
   pure and sinless out of his hands. The body itself, without the soul,
   cannot be the seat and subject of sin, as no irrational thing can,
   which is most evident. Therefore, many think there can be no such thing
   as propagation of sin from age to age; for how should it be? It cannot
   be at first found in the soul, which comes pure out of the hand of God.
   It cannot be seated or subjected in the body, which is not a subject
   capable of sin, or any mortality, abstractly considered. Here (I say)
   men do but oppose uncertainty to a certainty; a great many
   uncertainties to one plain and absolute certainty; that is, that sin
   doth really descend from age to age; and it is manifest, and in view
   with every one that observes, that men do not sooner begin to act
   rationally, than they do begin to act irregularly. But to oppose
   uncertainties to this plain and evident certainty, is a most
   unreasonable thing; equally unreasonable as that sophistical reasoning
   was of the philosopher that would undertake to prove, that there could
   be no such thing as a local motion: and another undertook to refute him
   by walking up and down before his eyes. There are too plain and sac!
   proofs, in the walkings of men from age to age, that as soon as ever
   they begin to move or act as men, they do act sinfully; and so that
   corruption doth descend and is transmitted. This is certain and
   evident. But to make this a difficulty, there are a great many
   uncertainties supposed and taken for granted, about which it concerns
   ignorant creatures (as we all are) to pronounce nothing one way or
   other.

   It is uncertain when or what time human souls were created, or were not
   created; whether all at once and at first, or whether at some distance
   of time, before they become to be united to human bodies. Not that the
   truth needs a determination of these matters, that way that would seem
   more favourable to it, as if it be not otherwise defended. But, in the
   mean time, we ought not to make difficulties greater than they really
   are, by supposing and taking for granted, that those things are
   certain, which really are not so.

   It is, again, altogether uncertain, by what sort of Divine Agency a
   human soul comes to be united to a human body, or whether they come
   into that union electively, yea or no; or whether by a certain sort of
   fatal necessity; these are uncertainties, and we are not to pronounce
   concerning them, as if they were certain.

   We do not know; philosophy cannot, with certainty, determine the
   strict, precise limitative hounds, between the sensitive nature, and
   the rational. We can be at no certainty, what dispositions there may be
   in the sensitive nature unto sin, though there can be no such thing as
   formal sin in it, abstractly considered; so that whensoever a
   reasonable, intelligent spirit, shall come to be united therewith, it
   will thereupon certainly sin: if it act, it will not act more
   rationally, than disorderly and irregularly. As if never so skilful a
   hand do play upon an instrument out of tune, if it sound, it will sound
   amiss; if never so skilful a horseman ride a lame horse, if he move, he
   will halt. We are altogether uncertain what of sensitive nature may he
   propagated with such and such dispositions in it, before the
   supervention of the reasonable soul.

   We are uncertain what orders there are of created spirits, so little do
   we know; and we ought not to pretend to know of the affairs of the
   invisible world, so that we ought, in justice, to profess ignorance of
   such things as these, whether there be any common spirit of nature
   endowed with a plastic power, that may be immediately concerned about
   the union of human bodies, and human souls with one another.

   These are things, though contraries, whereunto fur the most part, men
   take upon them to determine as certainties; and so make objections
   against the most certain and unquestionable truths. And the most of the
   difficulties in this matter do but arise from opposing, doubtful
   philosophical problems, to unquestionable theological verities. And
   whereas, there is a very great uncertainty in most parts of philosophy,
   in natural philosophy, more than in any other part, therefore, the
   presumptuous determinations of men, about these things, are very unfit
   to be brought into any competition with the most certain divine truths;
   that is, to oppose things that are doubtful, that can never be proved,
   one way or other, unto things that are either most evidently proved, or
   are in themselves so evident, as to need no proof. And this is the case
   as to the most of what appears difficult in tins affair. But then,

   IV. The last conclusion that I am to insist upon, is this, that it is
   most of all, unreasonable and absurd, to oppose such uncertainties to
   certainties, to object what is doubtful and dark, against what is plain
   and evident, when (as hath been evinced already) there is noshing can
   shake the asserted truth; but there are many considerations may be
   brought to break the force of such objections, as are raised against
   it; then, it is most specially absurd. And under this head it was, that
   I designed to produce and lay before you, the many considerations which
   tend to break the force of any thing that can be objected against the
   consistency and agreeableness of the righteous and universal perfection
   of the Divine Nature, with the continual transmission of the sinful
   imperfections of the human nature.

   The difficulty I need not remind you of, only, that it may lie the more
   distinctly in your thoughts, it is reducible to two heads; partly
   somewhat on the part of God, and partly some what on the part of man.
   On man's part first; because he is first to be considered in every
   thing that is evil, whether it be evil of sin, or evil of misery. And
   from what hath been said it appears difficult to be conceived, how man
   can be capable of propagating a sinful soul to another, when the soul,
   as such, is not propagated: and sin must reside there, inasmuch (as
   hath been said) as the body cannot be the seat or subject of sin,
   abstractly considered, and without the soul. On God's part, how it
   should stand with his righteousness and other perfections, continually
   to co-operate with second causes in the transmission of a sinful nature
   from age to age among men; so as thereby to make this world a seedplot
   of wickedness and misery, to all its inhabitants, from one generation
   to another; upon which, many have thought themselves necessitated to
   deny any such thing as the propagation of a corrupted nature, from
   generation to generation; and so to ascribe the whole business of the
   continuance of sin from age to age, in the world, only to imitation;
   one generation learning to be wicked, from another wicked generation,
   that did precede. But now, I say, as nothing can shake, the truths that
   have been asserted concerning God's righteousness; and man's
   unrighteousness continually descending, and transmitted from age to
   age, so there are many things to be alleged, to break the force of any
   such objections as these. And,

   I shall offer this to consideration, that in reference to God's concern
   in this matter, (about whose name and honour all our souls ought to be
   most tenderly and deeply concerned,) there is nothing to be said or
   thought but this; it were easy for him to have prevented such a descent
   of sinfulness, from age to age, in this world, by which also misery is
   continually entailed upon the inhabitants of it. But now (I say)
   consider these things in reference hereunto.

   1. Suppose that men should, hereupon ascribe the whole business of the
   continued sinfulness of the world, from age to age, to imitation only,
   this would no more solve the difficulty, than what is ordinarily
   asserted; for, even that also, how easy were it for him, the great God,
   (as we may think,) to have prevented this; that is, to have prevented
   the descent of sin, from age to age, by imitation? How easily might he
   have annihilated this world, or annihilated his creature man, either by
   exerting his power to this purpose, or indeed, by only withholding it!
   for then all must drop. Or, how easy had it been to him, to have made
   all perfectly good, and that they should have continued such, from age
   to age? and then there would have been no bad example for any one's
   imitation. And we do not know, but that the Divine Agency (such as it
   may be for ought we can tell) may be as little concerned in transmit
   ting human nature in its corruption, from age to age, as it would be,
   in sustaining sinful creatures that are corrupted, in co-operating in
   sinful actions. And without the co-operating influence of the First
   Cause, we are sure nothing can be done by a sufficient influence; that
   is, not done by an efficacious and necessitating one. And therefore, it
   is in vain to allege that, for the solving and expediting this
   difficulty, which doth itself carry as much of difficulty in it. And
   again,

   2. This is, next to be considered, that it is very unreasonable to have
   been expected from God, that he should annihilate an intelligent
   creature, upon the account of its having of fended him, or upon the
   account of its being likely to transmit its likeness to those that
   shall proceed and spring from such a progenitor. It was a most
   unreasonable thing (I say) that God should, hereupon, annihilate or
   reduce to nothing such a piece of the work of his own hands; that, had
   neither been suitable to the wisdom of God, nor his goodness: not to
   his wisdom, for there had been a direct regression, that he should undo
   and destroy his own work: because such a creature, the subject and
   effect of his productive and creating influence, had transgressed the
   law and rule of its own creation; it was unreasonable that he should,
   thereupon, reduce it to nothing. And it had been, (1 say) very
   disagreeable to his wisdom, as if he were surprised by the fall and
   lapse of his creature; as if he had not foreseen, as if he had not
   sagacity enough to apprehend such and such consequences. It hath been
   always (as we find by the course God hath held) reckoned by him, most
   worthy of him, and most Godlike, to turn ill events to good; but not to
   go back. And we shall, in time, come to shew you, how he hath done it
   in this case, to his own most transcendent glory, and to the advantage
   of his creatures, such as do not, by their own faulty opposition, stand
   in the way of his kind and gracious method towards them. But, that he
   should annihilate or bring a creature to nothing, that was capable of
   obeying and serving him because he did disobey him, and because he is
   likely to transmit sinful inclinations to those that come of him, or
   come after him, this is never to be expected from the blessed God: it
   is a thing disagreeable to his wisdom, that he should do and undo. When
   he is said to have repented that he made man, as when lie brought the
   flood upon the world; (Gen. vi.) that, as is plain in itself, and all
   do agree, is spoken more humano. And though he did (that he might give
   one proof of his just displeasancy at the apostasy of the world) bring
   on that deluge, yet you see he would not destroy the kind, but resolved
   to continue that, in subserviency to his further great and glorious
   designs.

   And indeed, it could much less have consisted with his goodness, to
   destroy the capacity which was in that order of creatures, of so high
   and great things as he designed them to, which should spring up of the
   human race. That he should prevent himself of that wonderful exercise
   of his mercy, grace, and good will towards men, of which we shall have
   occasion to discourse in its proper place, and as the series of things
   shall lead on. Therefore, that, I would have to be considered, that it
   was a most unreasonable thing to expect that God should, upon the
   transgression of his reasonable creatures, and lest sin should be
   transmitted from age to age, annihilate the kind, and reduce all to
   nothing. And,

   3. It was as little to be expected, that God should at first make all
   immutably good; that he should have made all his intelligent creatures
   immutably good at first, both angels in heaven, and men on earth; and
   so have provided and taken a course that sin should always be kept out
   of his creation; and that it should be impossible, where there is a
   nature propagated from age to age, there should be any thing of taint
   capable of falling into that nature; I say, that God should have done
   this, was as little to be expected from him.

   We may judge of things safely by the event; for that is judging after
   God; that is judging that to be becoming of God, which he hath done;
   that course to be most suitable to him, most Godlike, which he hath
   chosen. And so far as we can discern the reasonableness of the course
   which he hath taken, we are to take notice of it, and avow it upon all
   occasions. Now, from the course he hath taken, it appears most suitable
   to the excellencies of the Divine Being, every way, that he should have
   made intelligent creatures at first, mutable; not to make them
   immutably good and happy, which was to be their final state; but that
   there should be a preparatory, subservient state, introductive to that
   final state. This appears, upon all accounts, to have been most
   agreeable to the Supreme Wisdom and Goodness, that his creatures should
   not arrive to the highest perfection that they were capable of all at
   once, and at the very first; but that they should undergo a trial, and
   in that case, (if they must do so,) they must be left to their liberty
   at first, and being left so, there would be still a possibility that
   sin should be; and being once, that it should go on and be transmitted
   from age to age. And therefore, I add,

   4. That God's omnipotency, or what his absolute power can do, is not
   the only measure (abstractly considered) according to which it can be
   said God can do this or that. It is not fit or proper to say, that he
   can do whatsoever omnipotency, abstractly considered and alone, could
   do; because he is not a Being of power alone: power alone gives us but
   an inadequate conception of God; it doth not give us an intire
   conception of him, as if he were nothing else but power; for he is
   wisdom, and goodness, and holiness, and righteousness, and truth, as
   well as power. And therefore, that only is, in a true sense, possible
   to God, which is suitable to all his glorious excellencies to do,
   conjunctly considered; and not what is suitable to his power alone, and
   separately considered from the rest. When it is said, God cannot lie,
   and God cannot deny himself, and the like, the meaning is not as if
   there were a want of mere power to do any such natural act, considered
   as a natural act; but it is impossible to the divine perfection,
   (consider him as a Being of universal perfection, wherein all
   perfections do meet,) to do things so unlike himself, so unworthy of
   himself.

   Therefore, it was never to have been expected from divine power, or
   because he is omnipotent, that, therefore, he should do all things
   which that, abstractly considered, could do; as to have put an end to
   the generations of men lest they should sin on; or to have made all
   perfectly good at first, so as it should be an impossibility that any
   such thing as sin should be in the world, which only the possibility of
   its continuing in the world could, in an ordinary course, be prevented.
   This (I say) was never to be expected from the infinitely, absolutely,
   and universally perfect Being, who hath other perfections be longing to
   his nature besides that of power. But those things are only possible to
   him, which (all things considered) are most worthy of him, and most
   suitable to him. And again,

   5. We are further to consider, that the course of nature in the
   universe, it is most observably fixed and settled; so as (unless it be
   now and then in single instances) not to admit of change; that is, not
   to admit of change in an ordinary course. We may observe, that the
   course of nature is very rarely ever altered. But it were very
   unreasonable to expect, that it should be statedly or often altered. We
   find alterations in single instances; as in reference to that great
   order of day and night; when the sun stood still so long one time; and
   when it went back so many degrees at another time. And so when the sea
   did not hold its own course, or do agreeably to. its property, as a
   fluid thing, to overflow all that came within the compass of it, but
   was bound up as to the Israelites that passed through it. And the fire,
   it acted not, according to its natural property, to consume and burn
   what is combustible, in the case of the three children, who were in the
   fiery furnace unharmed and unhurt.

   But we are never to think that the course of nature should be
   ordinarily or often altered. And that it is not, even be cause it is
   riot, we ought in great reverence and humility to apprehend there are
   mighty occult reasons for this. And it should lay an awe upon our
   spirits, to behold the Author of nature, the God of nature, acting it
   on, in so stated and unaltered a course, from age to age, through the
   succession of many ages. If we understood no reason why it should be
   so, yet our minds should be struck with great reverence when we find,
   that ordinarily it is so. But we may apprehend very great reason for it
   too, in reference to the stated course of natural causes, as to what
   doth concern ourselves. What confusion would it make in the world, if
   ordinarily, the sun should vary its course, that no man could tell when
   it would rise, or when it would set, or when to undertake such or such
   a business? If God's obstructing that course in a single instance or
   two, should have been often repeated, so as to hold men's minds in a
   continual suspense, the sad and dismal consequences that would have
   ensued to this world (though this be but a very minute, inconsiderable
   part of the universe, the whole creation of God) are obvious to every
   one's view that considers.

   And as to the transmitting of the species of things, and the preserving
   of the species of all sorts of things, in the world, besides the
   decorum of it, and that admirable proof that there is of divine wisdom
   and providence therein, the usefulness thereof to ourselves, is most
   apparent to any one's notice and view, that through so many thousands
   of years there should be a preservation of the kinds of things. Go
   through the several orders of things: the ranks of things that come
   under our own notice, is an admirable discovery of God's wisdom and
   providence, and too little considered and reflected on; that the
   species of things should be unaltered, that what we find was the
   property of this or that herb, or plant, or tree, continues so. These
   things have still the same properties that they had. Look to the
   animals beneath us; we find the same properties the horse to be
   described by, so many ages ago, are in the same creature still. There
   is an admirable discovery of the power and wisdom of providence in
   this, which we ought to contemplate with great admiration, and great
   reverence, and have our spirits so much the more disposed to
   acknowledge and adore God the Maker of this world, and the great Author
   of universal nature. It would do more to preserve a religious
   impression upon our spirits Godward, than is commonly apprehended, if
   we did, now and then, allow our thoughts to fix in these
   contemplations, that whereas there is such a collision in this natural
   world, there are such antipathies, and contrarieties in the natures of
   things, that yet their natures are continued, preserved intire, from
   being confounded; though there is such a vast multiplicity, yet all
   preserved intire, through so many thousands of years. But then,
   consider further,

   6. That it is most evident, that the course of nature is as settled and
   constant, in reference to the production of men from age to age, as of
   any other creature. This is obvious, to wit, that there do spring up,
   from age to age, creatures of this species, and of the same kind, as
   there do of any other creatures of any other kind or species. And that,
   hereupon, we must apprehend a fixedness in the course of nature, not to
   be altered for a continuance, though it may in single instances here
   and there, in reference to this thing, as well as in reference to any
   thing else that falls under the regulation and mea sure of the law of
   nature. And,

   7. It is a mighty confirmation of the natural descent of sin with the
   nature of man, in the ordinary way, that when God designed the
   incarnation of his own Son, to avoid that corruption of nature
   descending to him, he there steps out of the ordinary course; a
   consideration that hath that weight with it, that if any one allow
   himself to think, it must over bear his mind in that matter, that sure
   there is some secret, profound reason in the counsel of God, (whether
   obvious to our view, or not obvious,} that the descent of corrupt
   nature was in the ordinary way unavoidable: that when God had a design
   to incarnate his own Son, when it was intended God should be manifested
   in the flesh, to avoid that contagion and corruption which, in the
   ordinary course, is transmitted, he doth in this single instance recede
   and go oft' from the ordinary natural course: and so the production is
   by the Holy Ghost, separating the very matter of the human body which
   itself, indeed, was not a capable subject of sin, as hath been said,
   and is plain in itself. But because the human nature had been
   corrupted, if it had descended in the ordinary way, (and that was
   inconsistent with the design on which a Redeemer was to come down from
   heaven into the world,) therefore, the ordinary course of procreation
   is declined and avoided: a most pregnant demonstration, that, in the
   ordinary course, sin is always naturally transmitted, in that this must
   be done on purpose to avoid that taint and contagion that otherwise
   would have been. But I add, in the next place, and shall go no further
   now,

   8. That men do make the difficulty in this matter greater than they
   need, by not apprehending and considering aright, wherein the
   production of a human creature lies. It is plain it doth not lie,
   though a human creature be a creature of a compounded nature, that hath
   a terrestrial and celestial part, yet, I say, it doth not lie in the
   production of either of the parts, but only in the uniting of them
   substantially with one another. It neither lies in the production of
   the soul, nor doth it lie in the production of the matter of the body,
   for all matter is generally apprehended to be ingenerable and
   incorruptible. But it lies (as I said) in the bringing of these into a
   substantial union with one another. And do but consider to this
   purpose, "Wherein doth death lie? wherein doth the death of a man
   consist?" His death, you will easily apprehend, must stand in direct
   opposition to his procreation and production. But death doth not lie
   either in the destruction of the soul, or of the body; but as it is a
   matter of faith, that the one remains, so it is a matter of sense, that
   the other remains after death. The soul is gone, but not reduced to
   nothing; the body remains, and will continue a considerable time the
   same intire frame that it was, even when the soul is gone. Death,
   therefore, doth neither lie in the destruction of the soul, nor in the
   destruction of the body; but in their disunion. So the procreation doth
   not lie, either in the production of the soul, or in the production of
   the body; (other wise than being so and so modified;) but in the union
   of those two parts, bringing it about, that they should be
   substantially united with one another.

   And if that be duly considered, there is a great deal of room and scope
   left to apprehend how such a thing may be very possible, (as we find it
   actual,) the continual descent of sin, and yet the holiness, and
   purity, and universal rectitude of the Divine Nature, not having any
   concern unbecoming itself, unsuitable to itself, herein.

   There are many more considerations behind, that will not be without
   weight in this matter: only, now, let us consider and bethink ourselves
   (as our assembly dissolves) of this one thing; how much more
   considerable a theme and subject we have for our thoughts, in that
   which is common to all ages, than can occur to us in what is peculiar
   to our own time! We are so amused and taken up about the little affairs
   (in comparison) of our own time, that we do not allow ourselves to
   consider and look, as we should do, with just intention of mind, upon
   those things that are great, and of common concern to all time. And we
   wonder there should be any miscarriage in the conduct of human affairs,
   and that the perversity of men, here and there, breaks out in this or
   that instance, forgetting there is a corrupt, human nature still
   descending from age to age, and from generation to generation, which
   naturally makes this world a region of impurity, and consequent misery,
   and gloominess and darkness. And we do not enough reflect upon the
   intestine cause of all our evils. Every one would be a great deal more
   ready to fall to self-accusation, than to the accusing of other men. "I
   have a corrupt nature in myself, out of which nature spring all the
   confusions and disorders in the world; all the dismal, tragical things
   that are any where to be found and observed in it." It is very
   unreasonable to let our minds be confined to the present, when we have
   such a vast prospect before us, looking forward, looking backward,
   looking inward, looking on this and that hand; to bind our thoughts
   when we have so vast a compass of things to look into, this is neither
   suitable to the reason of a man, nor so suitable as it should be to the
   more large and concerned mind of a christian, about the great things
   wherein the Christian Interest is, itself, concerned.

LECTURE XXXVIII. [54]

   Now we shall go on to add further considerations for shewing this
   fourth conclusion. And, thereupon, in the next place,

   9. We may further consider, that it is never thought a blemish to the
   justice of any government whatsoever, that children should inherit the
   poverty and rags of their parents that were either poor or profligate,
   or that had squandered or forfeited all that they had. This was never
   thought to have been a blemish to the government under which such
   persons may live, that children are born poor, when their parents had
   nothing to leave them; and so they have rags and beggary for their
   patrimony. This doth not use to be, or can be, with any equity, imputed
   to the government under which such live, as if that were to be blamed.
   And much less is it imputable in this case; because human governors are
   debtors to the communities which they govern, and do owe to them their
   utmost care and providence for them. But God (as hath been formerly
   shewed you) can be no debtor to any of his creatures, whether
   considered singly, or in communities, any otherwise than as he hath by
   any promise made himself debtor. But he never promised, never obliged
   himself by any promise, to keep sin out of the world, from hurting
   creatures that can only hurt themselves by it; or from preventing it to
   descend, or presently to throw it out of the world; though that he will
   do fully in his own time, and in his own way. And again,

   10. There can be no more obligation on the blessed God, to prevent
   moral defects among his creatures, than natural ones. If he be not
   obliged to prevent natural defects, he is as little obliged to prevent
   moral; because moral perfection must be founded in natural; as all
   morality hath its foundation in the nature of the creatures who are the
   capable subjects thereof. But plain it is, he can be under no
   obligation to prevent natural defects, or that his creatures should be
   naturally perfect: for in what sense will we suppose it requisite that
   he should make them so? Not with an absolute perfection, perfection in
   omni genere; for that is above the condition of a creature; no creature
   is capable of being universally perfect. That is the peculiar privilege
   and prerogative of the Original and Uncreated Being, to be absolutely
   and universally perfect. And therefore, to suppose him obliged to make
   all his creatures every way perfect, it were to suppose him obliged to
   have made them all gods; or we must suppose him not obliged to make any
   thing at all: because it is impossible that a made thing can be
   absolutely perfect. Or, should we suppose him under an obligation to
   have made things perfect in any kind above their own? That cannot be
   thought neither: for that must suppose, then, that there should have
   been no creatures of any inferior kind, or that all must have been of
   equal perfection, that every fly or worm must have been a cherubim or
   seraphim. Indeed, it is a most accurate discourse that I have taken
   notice of to this purpose, in a pagan writer, (as it is more generally
   reckoned,) Plotinus, who saith, that "to find fault with the Author of
   nature because of such and such defects, in such and such sorts of
   creatures, or in particular creatures, it were to find fault that he
   hath made the world an harmonious thing; that there are such orders and
   gradations in it; that, he hath made some inanimate things, and endowed
   some with a life of sense, and some below them with a life of
   vegetation, and some above them with a life of reason, and some above
   them with an angelical nature, and the like." All these comely orders
   of things should not have been, but all must have been of one order and
   kind. "And, (as he saith,) it were the same thing as to blame a limner,
   that he hath not in every thing drawn light colours without any foil;
   or a comedian, (the author of a comedy,) that he hath not made every
   person that is to act a part, a king, or a hero; that there should be
   any that doth sustain the part of mean and inferior persons."

   It is plain, and out of doubt, that God is not obliged to make his
   creatures all, either absolutely perfect, or to give them higher
   perfections than do belong to their own kind: or (we may add) to give
   to every one of them those perfections that that kind is capable of.
   For we find that there are some of greater health, some of less; some
   of greater strength, some of less, in that order of creatures wherein
   they are. And we find that there are such things as hereditary
   diseases, that do descend, and generally are found every where through
   the human race. But (I say) God can no more be under obligation to
   prevent moral than natural defects, among his creatures. And again,

   11. We are to consider further, that though the descent and
   transmission of a sinful pravity with the nature of man may appear to
   have a difficulty with it, yet it is not altogether unaccountable, if
   we do but consider things as they are, with that compass of thought
   which we ought. Nay, it is not ordinarily conceivable, how it should be
   otherwise, if we do but admit into our thoughts, what a concurrence
   there is of several things to this purpose. As,

   (1.) The retirement of the Holy, Divine Spirit from man, having once
   sinned. And it is certain, that he did retire thereupon, that he hath
   retired, otherwise than as according to the Redeemer's method he is
   returned. There was an antecedent retirement and withdrawing, and that,
   upon the sin of man, upon sin's entering into the world: for do but
   observe that Gal. iii. 14, 15. "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
   of the law, by being made a curse for us; for cursed is every one that
   hangeth on a tree; that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the
   Gentiles." (That, which was the blessing of Abraham upon that account,
   might now be a more diffused blessing, and reach the Gentiles too,) For
   what? That they might receive the promise of the Spirit (or the
   promised Spirit) through faith. Now consider what the blessing is, and
   measure the opposite curse by that: the blessing, you see, is the gift
   of the Spirit; what is the curse then, but the debasing of the Spirit?
   And certainly then, that was the curse of the law, the curse of the
   violated law. As soon as the law was broken, the Divine, Holy Spirit
   was cursed away from the nature of man; or, man was cursed, so as that
   thereby this Spirit should be withheld, should be kept off, otherwise
   than as upon the Redeemer's account, and according to his methods, it
   should be restored. And then,

   (2.) Consider, hereupon, the nature and kind of that corruption that is
   conveyed and doth descend, and how the Scripture speaks of it,
   generally under the notion of carnality. That which is born of the
   flesh is flesh, John iii. 6. That is, now, where there is no divine
   birth, where nothing is born of the Spirit, or where the work of
   regeneration hath not taken place, the production is nothing else but
   flesh, the mere human nature; to wit, the denomination is taken from
   that which governs: though a man be not all flesh, the denomination is
   taken from that which prevails. What is the thing produced when a human
   creature is born? A piece of flesh: as that which is born of the Spirit
   is spirit, whenever that birth comes to obtain and take place with any
   soul. That which is born of the flesh is but flesh; not as if the
   nature of man were nothing but flesh, but because carnality is the
   prevailing thing in the lapsed state of man, that carries the name, and
   now he is called nothing but flesh. And,

   (3.) This is to be considered, to facilitate our apprehension of this
   matter, that the sensitive nature, (which only is capable of being
   propagated,) though it cannot itself be the seat and subject of sin,
   yet it may be in very great disposition thereunto: or things may be
   there, in that inferior region, in that disposition, that there cannot
   but be sinfulness as soon as the intelligent mind and spirit supervene.
   All things will lie in the sensitive nature, as it is transmitted and
   conveyed in that state, that when the reasonable and intelligent spirit
   supervenes, though the sensitive nature (as such) is not capable of
   sin, yet supervening and coming into union, there cannot but a
   sinfulness ensue. And,

   (4.) We have further to consider to this purpose, how manifest the
   power of imagination is, every where through the world. And so, how
   supposable it is, that the power of parental imagination may be great.
   And we find it is so, very frequently, to make an impression upon the
   grosser corporeal bulk. There are signatures upon the foetus, as many
   unquestionable histories do inform us, that speak of parental
   imaginations. But much more may it he strong on the more fine sort of
   vehicles, in which, we have very little reason to doubt, the reasonable
   soul is lodged, and invested with, whenever it comes into union with a
   terrestrial body. And it cannot be difficult, to apprehend what
   signatures parental imagination may make there, when the soul comes to
   act in a body so and so formed. I do not merely, now, speak of this
   corporeal external bulk, but that finer indument, that is, that
   immediate inwrapping of the soul in the body; and which, in all
   likelihood, it carries away with it out of the body whensoever it
   leaves it. What signatures may he there easily made by parental
   imagination, it is not hard for us to apprehend, if we let our thoughts
   work upon that subject, especially considering what impressions have
   been made upon the grosser or more corporeal bulk itself. And then
   consider,

   (5.) The natural activity of the intelligent mind and spirit, when it
   comes into union and supervenes, especially with respect to its
   cogitativeness, its thinkingness, its power to think; which how soon it
   doth exert, and put forth its power into act, we do not know: but, to
   be sure, as soon as its organs are capable, and as soon as it becomes,
   in its own nature, a cogitative or a thinking thing, nothing is more
   essential to it than a power of thought; so that as soon as it can use
   thought, it must: especially the organs that it depends upon, and is to
   act by, being so and so disposed before, it cannot be but there will be
   thinking amiss. And according to this course as the power of using
   thought grows riper, it will be more and more irregular.

   And here are the first ebullitions of corrupt nature. The Lord knows
   the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. As soon as he thinks, he
   will think vainly; he will think vanity. Psalm xciv. 11.--"And God saw
   that the imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil, and
   that continually," in that corrupt state of the world. Genesis vi. 5.
   And, "out of the heart proceed evil thoughts." Where there is a corrupt
   heart, the first ebullitions of it are in impure thoughts, vain
   thoughts, sinful thoughts; that is, that such things, such kind of
   phantasies are impressed, as do take their rise only from a sensible
   world: towards an unknown God who is invisible, there are no signatures
   that can have any power, because they are buried and overwhelmed by
   such a supervening cloud of sensitive images or imaginations;
   thereupon, there must be aversion from God, disaffection to him,
   disinclination towards him, as an unknown, and an unsuitable, and an
   undesirable Object. And so, here is the very root of all evil. So that
   he may easily see how it comes to have place, even in the corrupt
   nature of lapsed man. And then, again,

   (6.) We are further to consider, how industrious we must needs suppose
   the prince of the apostasy to be, for the continuation of that sin in
   the world, which he introduced into it. And that is a thing less
   considered in this matter than I think it should be, and doth claim to
   be. Plain it is, that the whole order of apostate men became apostate,
   by being accomplices with this great prince of the air. And so sinful
   men are more universally accomplices with hell, with the apostate
   prince of the darkness of this world. Nothing is plainer: and do but
   consider, hereupon, what the parentage of a sinner is, as a sinner; "Ye
   are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do."
   John viii. 44. They are the words of him who is truth itself, and who,
   therefore, cannot deceive us. Now, in what respects do we think that
   the devil is called the father of sinners? Not in respect of their mere
   nature, not in respect of their naturals, the substance either of their
   souls, or of their bodies, but only in respect of their morals, the
   sinfulness, the corruption, the impurity of them. But is he a father in
   respect of this? Then, certainly, it must owe its beginnings, in
   individuals, to him too; as children do owe their beginning, wherein
   they are children, to their parents.

   And let but that context be observed, 1 John v. 18, 19. "He that is
   born of God, keepeth himself, that the wicked one toucheth him not."
   Therefore, this is a divine birth; there is a self-preserving principle
   conveyed with that divine nature which is new born, that the wicked one
   shall not touch him; that is, mortally to touch him; not touch him so
   as to kill him; but he hath touched mortally all the rest. And,
   therefore, the apostle adds in the very next words, "we are of God," to
   wit, new-born of God; an eliptical expression: the word being born,
   having been before used, it was enough to say, we are of God; born of
   God. But how is the case with the rest of the world? They "all lie in
   wickedness," we read it: in all likelihood, it should be read, "in that
   wicked one," spoken of before, in that foregoing word: that is, in the
   wicked one, who can only touch those that are born of God; but doth
   mortally touch the rest.

   And thereupon, we find that the common course of the unregenerate and
   unconverted world, it is said to be after "the power of the prince of
   the air, that works in the children of disobedience." Ephes. ii. 2.
   Whereupon, in the very next words, they are said to be children of
   wrath too, by nature. Observe how things lie connected; "and are by
   nature children of wrath." By nature, how so? Inasmuch as there is a
   corrupt and depraved nature continually descending and transmitted;
   wherein we are not to suppose him to be without his advantage, or
   without his agency, who is "the prince of the darkness of this world."
   and who is also called "the God of this world." 2 Cor. iv. 4.

   And it is not, therefore, strange, that men should be, as to all their
   concerns, so much subject to the diabolical power, because they have
   been accomplices with him from the beginning, even the first apostasy;
   when nobody can suppose (that considers matters equally) but that he
   must be continually intent to keep his ground in this world; and doth
   all that in him lies, to transmit impurity from age to age. And his
   advantage, in order hereunto, upon the sensitive nature, cannot but be
   great. Though he cannot immediately touch the mind and spirit itself,
   without its own consent, without its own betraying itself; yet, that
   power variously actuates the sensitive nature; and thereby, the
   inferior appetite, and whatsoever is in the lower region of the soul;
   (this is no inapprehensible thing;) to wit, to cherish sin, and to
   foment and cherish it the same way, by the mediation of sense by which
   he first introduced it. And, by sense, we are not to understand only
   the external sense, but we are to understand, under that notion,
   whatsoever lies within the compass of sensitive nature, imagination and
   appetite, as well as the external sense. And what signatures he may
   make upon it, is more easy for us to apprehend as possible, than to
   conclude as certain: but very likely it is, that his power may go very
   far; and we are not to doubt but his malice will go as far as his
   power. And then, I add upon all this,

   12. That there being such a sinful pravity conveyed and descending down
   with our nature, from age to age, this must, in the beginning thereof,
   be matter of just displeasancy to the blessed God. It cannot be, but
   there must be aversion in his holy and pure nature, to a nature impure
   and unholy. And let us but consider this, that we are said to be, (as
   was taken notice of before,) "by nature, the children of wrath." lying
   under the divine displeasure, under a vindicta, even by nature: Ephes.
   ii. 2, 3. And pray, let the reason of the thing be a little discussed
   and looked into. Consider whether that various inclination and
   disposition, before actual sin, be not in itself a hateful thing. And
   that nothing which is asserted, among those that have inquired into,
   and do profess the truth in this matter, may appear harsh and hard, let
   us but consider how such matters used to be judged of by human
   measures, by men; sure, in things wherein they will not censure men, we
   may think God more uncensurable. If men will allow themselves the
   liberty of free thought, they cannot deny it. But whereas, there is
   such a thing as human justice, pray do but consider how it useth to
   have its exercise in matter of punishment, and upon what ground. And
   whereas, all men have some natural notions remaining with them of right
   and wrong, and they have aversion or propension, according to such
   notions, more or less, do but consider how these do work among men,
   considered as men. Let me but set your thoughts on work on the latter
   of these first: that is, take a virtuous person, one that goes under
   that common estimate, by all that know him, as a person of strict
   virtue. Will he not, as such, disaffect an ill man, a vicious and
   wicked man? And you will say, he instinctively doth so; that is, the
   wickedness he sees in him. But then. I would inquire, What is it that
   such a one disaffects, in such another? Is it, I say, any abstract act
   he doth? That can never be; for that, abstracted or prescinded from an
   evil inclination, is not the thing that he hates or can hate; that any
   man can reasonably hate; for an act, an external act, that falls under
   the notice of another, take it off from an evil inclination, it is but
   a casual thing; and it is morally neither good nor evil; and therefore,
   can be no object of a rational hatred. Therefore, whatsoever there is
   of just hatred in the vilest and most profligate person's course, What
   is the object of that just hatefulness? Not the external acts,
   abstractly considered, from a vicious inclination; but as they proceed
   thence, or as they are supposed to proceed thence. So that it is an ill
   habit of mind, of a vicious mind, that is the object of hatred, every
   where, with virtuous men.

   And then, consider, what it is that human laws do punish, in the next
   place. Who do they punish? Do they punish the external action
   abstractly, from the evil inclination or intention? Never at all: for
   if it doth appear that there was an action done against the rule of the
   law, that doth not proceed from an ill inclination or intention, it is
   looked upon as a casual thing, and not punishable. Therefore, the thing
   that is punishable, is the ill intention and disposition, only
   discovering itself by such and such external acts. This is plain in
   itself.

   But now, whereas, we have no way to know the inclinations of men's
   minds, but by external indicia, the disposition and habitude of every
   one lie immediately open to the divine inspection: there is all the
   difference. If then, there be a just and reasonable ground to hate an
   ill disposition, an ill inclination, because it doth discover itself by
   external acts to us, why is there not the same reason that it should be
   hated, or that it should be matter of displeasure, whenever it appears,
   unto him by whom things are immediately seen in themselves, and as they
   lie without external discovery? And therefore, a sinful generation is
   called "a generation of vipers." You have poison, you have malignity in
   your natures. This he can see, that sees all things, and knows all
   things, before it doth, se prodere, before it discovers itself in
   sinful actions; before it appears to our view, before it can be
   discerned by us. And therefore, consider further,

   13. Which will be a further proof of the former, and contribute further
   towards our common end, the clearing of difficulties in this matter,
   that it is plain, that infants, as soon as they come to partake of the
   human nature, they do need a Redeemer, as much as others: for I hope
   there is none among us that is such a durus infantum pater, so hard and
   harsh a father of infants, but to admit, that many infants may be
   saved, may become blessed creatures hereafter. Well, but how shall they
   come to be so without a Redeemer, without a Christ? Is not he said to
   be "the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world?" Whatsoever
   sins of the world that are taken away, they are taken away by him. But
   what? are infants no part of the world? They are said to compose the
   kingdom of God in this world; that is, concur to the composition.
   "Suffer little children to be brought unto me, for of such is the
   kingdom of God." Those that were brought in arms, that were carried, of
   them it is said, "of such is the kingdom of God;" that kingdom whereof
   our Lord Jesus Christ is the immediate King. He takes them into his
   kingdom. They come under the government of the Redeemer; then they did
   need a Redeemer, and to be dealt with in a way of grace, and not merely
   upon a natural point. They are a part of that body which he gave
   himself to purchase and sanctify. Ephes. v. 25, 26. And it is plain,

   14. That they do need to be regenerated; they need regeneration as well
   as redemption; and which, indeed, hath its foundation in redemption:
   "for that which is born of the flesh, is but flesh." and no more: but
   "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," and that Spirit is the
   Spirit of Christ: and if we have not the Spirit of Christ, we are none
   of his. And therefore, I would subjoin to all these considerations, in
   the last place,

   15. That whatsover God thought fit not to do, by way of prevention of
   the corning of sin into the world, and of its being transmitted in it,
   he hath done with more unspeakably glorious advantage, by way of
   remedy. And the remedy for setting things right, where things were out
   of course, in the apostate world, it is two ways. The one whereof doth
   more directly respect us, and the other himself: that is, by
   redemption, and the penal judgment. These two things will set all
   things right. I cannot now enlarge as I would: but very true it is
   indeed, that it must mightily pose, nonplus all our understandings, if
   there were to be continual descent of our sinful generation one after
   another in this world eternally. If things were to run on thus to all
   eternity, it were the most unaccountable thing imaginable. But we find
   this is not to be; there will be a period put to this course within
   awhile. This world, and the wickedness of it, must come to an end: and
   while sin is running on, from age to age, grace hath its exercise too,
   which runs a parallel, from age to age. And therefore, there is a far
   more glorious display of all the divine perfections in the appointed
   means of remedy, than there would have been in the prevention of those
   great disorders that have been in the world, by sin's once entering
   into it, and continuing a course in it so long.

LECTURE XXXIX. [55]

   My design (as you have heard) in choosing the text I have been upon for
   some time, was not to speak of the corruption of human nature
   abstractly, and in itself, but to consider it here as it stands in
   connection with the acknowledged justice and righteousness of God; and
   so to make that my business, to vindicate God's justice in reference to
   this case,--a continual transmission of a corrupt nature, in this
   world, from age to age, that draws death and misery after it, and which
   God permits to run on in such a course; though (as hath been told you)
   if we did consider his omnipotency abstractly, and absolutely, it might
   be supposed easy for him to have hindered it. To this I have spoken at
   large, and will repeat nothing more, than only to take notice of so
   much, as the sum of all, that whatsoever is, with the most
   plausibleness, wont to be alleged against the righteousness of the
   divine procedure in this matter, doth lie, for the most part, in men's
   taking such and such things for granted, as if they were certainly so;
   which are most uncertain, and whereof (whereas all men do all they can)
   they must be, in a great measure, ignorant: if such had but the modesty
   to confess the ignorance which they cannot cure or remedy, the justice
   of God, in permitting all men to come into the world with sinful
   natures, would appear in glorious light and lustre before their eyes,
   darkened with no cloud; nor would these dash in the dark one against
   another, but be easily conceived in their minds, without the least
   appearance of repugnancy to one another. As we see lie in the
   Psalmist's, who, in almost the same breath confesseth the triumphant
   justice and righteousness of God, and the corruption of that nature
   that did descend to him, and doth descend from man to man, and from age
   to age.

   But now, it only remains to make Use of what hath been said upon this
   very important subject. And herein, considering one of the things
   considered and asserted, by itself, to wit, the corruption of the
   nature, which is conveyed and transmitted down from parents to
   children. The first use that I shall hereupon make will be this--To
   shew how greatly they are concerned, who are parents, or who may be so,
   to their utter most to strive against this radical evil that is
   descending and running down, from age to age, in this world which we
   inhabit, and whereof we are the sinful inhabitants. This is a thing
   which, in the notion, we generally acknowledge, that there is such a
   descent of corruption and sinfulness, from age to age, in this world.
   But even where this truth is admitted, it is a truth hid and shut up in
   unrighteousness, while the hearts of very few are in any measure
   suitably affected and influenced to take that course, pursuant and
   agreeable to so plain and so confessed a truth as this is. It is that
   which, where it is understood and acknowledged, and were it understood
   and acknowledged all the world over, it ought universally to have the
   same effect, ought to startle the world, to awaken men every where, as
   if there were an universal plague spread over all towns, cities,
   countries, and kingdoms, at once. And if that were the case, that any
   poor creature could not tell whither to go, or where to set his foot,
   secure and free from the danger of meeting such a shaft or arrow that
   should immediately pierce his very heart, in what a condition were this
   world, if thus it were with every one? But there is a thousand fold
   worse mischief to be feared; and they that think of flying from it,
   carry it about them, and can no more fly from it than they can fly from
   themselves, or run away from their own nature. It is not considered,
   that they carry sin, and death, and hell, about them, even from their
   very original; things complicated with their natures. Who would pretend
   to believe so horrid a truth, a truth of so horrid and tremendous
   import, and not be filled with horror about it? Yet, every one goes on
   unconcerned, as if there were no fear, no danger, no harm, about them,
   or before them. But, I say,

   First. All should understand, hence, that are, or may be, parents, of
   how unspeakable concernment it is to them, to counterstrive to the
   uttermost against this great mischief which they are, or are like to
   be, instruments of; transmitting sin in this world, and conveying it
   yet further down from this to another generation in it. And this I take
   to be a head, upon this occasion, fit to be enlarged upon: and
   therefore, I shall spend this hour upon it. And therein shall shew
   you--Wherein such as are, or may be, parents, should use their
   endeavour to counterwork this radical evil: and then--Upon what
   considerations they should be awakened and engaged effectually
   hereunto.

   1 Wherein they should endeavour against it, who are, or may be,
   parents. Why,

   (1.) By endeavouring, out of hand, to become seriously godly
   themselves, so that if ever God call them, or order things so in
   reference to themselves, and that they become pa rents, as a corrupt
   seed will more or less spring from them, they may be the means, also,
   of raising up a godly seed in this world. The thing which God hath
   designed even in the first founding of families upon this earth: that
   whereas, a corrupt nature, if ever they come to be parents, will
   descend from them, without their design, they may be also instruments,
   in the hand of God, of conveying his image, his light, his grace, with
   their own design, in subordination (as all instruments must be) to the
   Supreme Agent, that alone can make them capable of being effectual ones
   to such a blessed end.

   That, I say, must be their first care in order hereunto; that is, out
   of hand, to endeavour to become godly themselves; to do what is
   possible for them to do in order thereunto: not content themselves that
   they have an empty, spiritless form of godliness about them, that is
   never likely to be active to such a purpose: but that there he the life
   and power of godliness, which will be active to the uttermost it is
   capable of, in pursuance of so high and great a design. As, naturally,
   men are generally the devil's instruments, to promote his dark and
   impure kingdom in this world; so if ever God call me to the state and
   condition of a parent, I will, through his grace, be his instrument, as
   much as in me, to promote that holy kingdom, which he hath formed, and
   is intent to promote and propagate in this world, as a counter-kingdom,
   against the power of that wicked kingdom.

   In order hereunto, under that manifestation. God is pleased to make of
   himself through Christ in the gospel, they ought to surrender and give
   up themselves to God in Christ: herein becoming godly, doth first begin
   when, under the convictive and operative light of influence and grace
   transmitted in the gospel, persons do make a surrender of themselves to
   God through Christ. "Yield yourselves unto God." as the expression is,
   Rom. vi. 13. It is but a practical answer to God's claim and
   challenge--"Yield yourselves to God." He demands his right; he insists
   upon his interest in you, as you are his creatures, and the work of his
   hands. And what! will you not yield, not yield him his own? Will you
   withhold from him what is his? what he hath so indisputably a title to,
   and interest in? Or, can you ever have a design of helping to raise up
   a godly seed in this world, if you will never be godly yourself? but
   remain a continual fighter against God, and a striver against him,
   under that gospel of peace and grace, wherein he is continually
   bespeaking you to be his? And then,

   (2.) Let such as may be parents of children, lay the more immediate
   foundation of such an endeavour, as I have been speaking of. in
   marrying after a godly sort: in marrying holily, whensoever any are
   called thereunto; that is, with a design for God. He that is the
   Author, is to be the End of all things. And whereas, that same state is
   his institution and appointment, it is a most insolent absurdity, for
   any to take upon them, as if they were to, please themselves, or to
   gratify an inclination, or serve an interest of their own, with neglect
   of God's great interest. They that enter, or think of entering, into
   that state, are required to do it in the Lord, as an only thing. 1 Cor.
   vii. 39. And it is a great deal of pity, that discourses about such
   matters, and relating to this affair, are so generally confined to a
   corner only, and that opportunity is not given of speaking to
   assemblies upon so important a matter as this is; that any undertaking
   or design, in this kind, is to be done in the Lord, and that as an only
   thing. Marry they may, only in the Lord. But when they neglect this,
   they leave out the only thing that can make a blessed marriage; which
   certainly must argue a very profane mind, when men and women dare
   venture, and rush upon a matter of so great importance as that, and
   leave out the very only thing that concerns them in it. This doing of
   such a thing in the Lord must import,

   [1.] A doing it for him, with a design for him; to wit, as one's
   principal end. And let it be considered, how great an aberration here
   is from the proper scope, generally, in the world, and even in the
   Christian world, as to this thing: that the first thing commonly
   thought of, is some such mean matter as this, in comparison mean, I say
   in comparison; "I design to change my condition; well, let me think
   then, how I can please my fancy; let me contrive how I can best satisfy
   my sensual inclination; and how I can best serve my worldly interest
   and advantage; where to have a great fortune; and what may set me up
   into, and promote me in, the most advantageous way of trade, and the
   like."

   What the evangelist says, in another case, of our Lord's animadversion
   upon the scribes and pharisees, that their religion stood in the
   tithing of mint, anise, and cummin, neglecting the weightier matters of
   the law,--judgment, mercy, faith, and the love of God; to wit, that
   those other things they might and ought to have done, but not to have
   left the other undone: the like may be said in this case. There is no
   blame in looking after one suitable, in respect of comeliness, or in
   respect of fortune, or the like. This may well enough be done; but not
   to leave the great and most weighty matter and importance: that is,
   Where shall I have a suitable help, to promote religion in the world,
   and to plant religion in a family, if it shall please God to make us
   the founders of a family? one that may help to bear a part with me, in
   maintaining and keeping up the interest of godliness, in opposition to
   the common corruption of human nature, which is still descending, from
   age to age, in this world? How little is thought of among us, so as
   hereby to design the business of marriage for this in the Lord as the
   principal thing? When that is not made the principal thing, the very
   act is idolatry. To be the end of all things is appropriate to Deity:
   and he must be your Supreme End, even in this thing, or you make
   yourselves so: and if so, you are an idol of jealousy, set up against
   God; as if this world were made for you, and you were made for
   yourself; and as if you might take upon yourself to do what you please
   here, without reference to the Supreme Ruler and Lord of all.
   Therefore, it is without question, that he and his interest, in this
   affair, must be designed in the first place.

   [2.] That in subserviency to it, whosoever designs to enter into that
   state, they must give themselves up, by solemn covenant, to God in
   Christ first. That is to do this thing in the Lord, which we are told
   is the only thing in this matter. And that is a most unaccountable
   piece of presumption, that people will take upon them, to dispose of
   themselves, give themselves, to one another, before they have ever
   given themselves to God through Christ, which is the first and most
   fundamental relation. You all ought to know you are not your own, you
   have nothing to do with yourselves, you have not yourselves to dispose
   of otherwise, but from, and by, and under, God. And therefore, give to
   him your own persons; give yourself to the Lord, in the first place,
   before you think of giving yourself to another. You have not power over
   yourselves, nor can dispose of yourselves. None have so much power over
   themselves, as that they ought to think of giving him, or her self,
   away without God; but for God: and therefore, the gift must be made to
   himself first; and that union with him be made fundamental, to that
   other subsequent and inferior union, much inferior.

   But here it may be said, What then, may only godly persons marry? or
   those only that are in covenant with God in Christ?

   To that I will only say in short, and the business will then be" clear
   enough. It is a question that will answer itself. You ought to give up
   yourselves to God through Christ, every one, the first thing you do,
   out of hand, without a moment's delay. For till this be done, you are
   in a state of rebellion against him; he lays his claim to us all upon a
   natural right, and upon the Redeemer's acquisition too, who died, and
   revived, and rose again, that "he might be Lord, Owner, and Ruler, of
   the living and dead; to wit, of all most absolutely.

   Therefore, this is a thing not to be deferred a moment. So as if the
   question be, Hath a man sinned then, if he hath married while he was
   yet ungodly? I say, his sin doth not lie in what he hath done, but it
   lies in what he hath not done. It doth not lie in this, that you have
   married; but it lies in this, that you have not taken God for your God,
   and given up yourselves to God through Christ, to be his: here lies the
   sin. Marrying, abstractly, and alone, is not a sin; nay, it is, in many
   cases, a duty: but then, there is a prior duty, a superior duty:
   therefore, none sin by marrying, barely, but his sin lies in not giving
   up himself to God, which he is under continual, momentally obligation
   to do. So that you are in a rebellion every moment you defer it: you
   keep from God his own right, his own treasure, that he hath made, and
   that he should be served by, as his own. And that is the case, which
   neither deserves, nor needs any further answer. But,

   (3.) The design of religion to be, to our uttermost, kept up, from age
   to age, in this world, is to be served, as much as is possible, by
   those that have the prospect of being parents in their agreed
   resolution with themselves, whenever God shall give them posterity, to
   temper and qualify their complacency herein, with that grief, sorrow,
   and concern, and fear, which the case itself challengeth, lest there
   should be a transmitting of corrupt and sinful nature, without a due
   subsequent endeavour to remedy what they could not prevent. There ought
   to be, I say, a joint agreement and resolution between such, if ever
   God give them posterity, to qualify and temper the complacency commonly
   taken herein, with that just mixture of concern, grief, and fear; that
   since there is a corrupt nature conveyed, lest it should go alone, or
   remain alone; and a holy, divine nature not be communicated, too,
   through any neglect on their part, when God doth give them opportunity
   of treating and dealing with such, who shall have sprung from them, in
   order to this end. There ought to be a great and deep concern of mind
   and spirit to this purpose; that, whereas, commonly, when a child is
   born, all that is considered in such a case, is, that now such a family
   is likely to be built up; and they take great complacency in it, that
   there is art offspring arisen to them: but this complacency is without
   that mixture and qualification, which the state of the case, as it is
   in itself, doth challenge. For it ought to be considered, We have been
   the instruments of bringing into the world a sinful creature, an impure
   creature, a guilty creature; one that is a child of wrath by nature.
   The complacency that is taken in having posterity, should not drown or
   swallow up such just considerations as these are, which, being
   entertained, may have their due effect, and proper influence, to excite
   to that subsequent duty which will be incumbent upon such parents.
   Arid,

   (4.) Such parents ought to endeavour a most entire agreement in, and
   understanding of, a solemn and early dedication and devoting of such,
   their issue, to God. This ought to be done understandingly, solemnly,
   and early. And the parents ought to agree to give God his right, in
   their child; that as it is by nature a child of wrath, it may be, by
   grace, an heir of mercy; they doing what in them is incumbent in order
   there unto; they taking hold of God's covenant, which is not a nullity;
   and it is profane to think it so. And, indeed, nothing doth more betray
   the interest of God, and Christ, and Godliness, and Christianity, in
   the world, than the slight and tri fling management of the important
   affairs of baptism; that it is so little understood; and that men play
   with it as they do; and as they do also, with that of marriage, as if
   it were matter of sport, when it is one of the things of the greatest
   importance in all the world. But it ought to be considered, here is a
   creature corrupt and impure, it is true, but in which God hath the
   first and proper right; it belongs to him, and he can make this impure
   creature a holy creature. And I offer it to him upon his own claim, and
   challenge, and the engagement of his word, in order thereunto, that he
   may do so. Herein parents should agree: "We dedicate to thee what thou
   hast given us, more thine than ours. We have had our contribution to
   the impurity of it: we can only hope to have it made a pure and holy
   creature by thy holy, gracious, and vital influences, in thine own way
   and time imparted, and communicated to it." And it is upon this
   account, that parents are sanctified to one another; though but one
   should be a believer, that what springs from them should be holy; that
   is, by a federal holiness, related to God, and capable of being devoted
   to him. 1 Cor. vii. 11. And then,

   (5.) Pursuantly to such a devoting of their little ones to God, it
   ought to be a joint agreement between parents, that their first care
   should be taken about their minds. "Now, here is a little one to be
   brought up, to be educated:" this should be said, as a fundamental
   resolution, by agreement and consent of parents. "Our first care shall
   be about the mind of this little one, if it live to be a capable
   subject of our education and instruction; that is it we will first be
   chiefly concerned about For this is an intelligent and immortal part;
   this is the seat of God's holy image, if ever it shall be produced; and
   it is itself his natural image: for as it is a mind, or hath a mind, so
   it is a spiritual and intelligent being, and is like God naturally, and
   his very offspring, upon this account, who is pleased to style himself,
   the Father of spirits, and the God of the spirits of all flesh;' of
   those spirits that dwell so meanly as in flesh. And therefore, that
   ought to be the agreed and' resolved first care; that our principal
   concernment be about the minds of our little ones." The care that is
   commonly, most of all, taken, is about the outward man, and the
   external concernments of our posterity: they love to see them fair,
   comely, beautiful, healthful, strong, vigorous; wish to see them have
   straight limbs, and the like; but do not care how crooked dispositions
   they have. This is unaccountable, and detestable, that it should be
   thus with a reasonable creature; those that are capable of
   understanding the differences of things; and of how much greater
   importance one thing is than another. But this, I say, ought to be the
   first care, and should be the agreement between parents, (with
   dependence upon the grace of God,) about the minds of our little ones.
   And,

   (6.) In order hereunto, there ought to be a very diligent observation
   made of them, to see what their natural temper is, or is like to prove,
   which will discover itself to an observing eye, by early indications,
   one way or other: that is, whether my child is likely to prove dull or
   docile; whether it is likely to prove mild and meek, or froward and
   peevish; whether it is likely to prove tractable or intractable;
   whether it is likely to prove mean and low spirited, or great and high
   spirited. These different dispositions will soon and early appear to
   observing eyes. Such notices should be taken by prudent pa rents, and
   must be by conscientious ones, who have a design for the good of their
   families, that they may know how to acquit themselves in aftertimes
   accordingly. Some children will discover more of a natural
   timorousness; others will discover more boldness and venturousness, and
   that very early. And careful observation should be made of the temper
   as it doth more early prodere se, discover itself, offer itself to view
   and observation, that there may be suitable measures taken, for prudent
   applications afterwards, as the case shall require. And then, again,

   (7.) Resolution ought to be taken between parents, and especially the
   mothers, (whose part will be more about the child in its more tender
   years,) to watch against any sinful inclinations, one way or other, as
   they shall discover themselves. If there be any appearance of
   falsehood, of wrathfulness, of envy, or revengefulness; of pride, or
   haughtiness in children, to animadvert upon these betimes. And
   especially of immoderate desires after anything; only it ought to be
   distinguished, whether it be the desire of that which is necessary for
   it; or a desire only of that which curiosity may prompt to desire. That
   which is necessary for it must be had; but not upon its first
   signification of a desire; that it may be made to understand betimes,
   dependance and subjection. And that the less it hath of understanding
   of its own, the more it is to be managed by the parent's understanding;
   and the having, even of necessary things, is not to be the reward of
   demanding them, or asking for them.

   But for unlawful inclinations, they are to be checked, with all the
   care and industry imaginable, very early; any such as I have instanced
   in, or whatsoever besides can be instanced in; repress the beginnings
   of these things, as you would the beginnings of a disease that may
   prove mortal to your child. And it is this neglect, (especially in
   mothers,) that ripens such evils as these, thus radicated in the very
   natures of children, till they are incurable; till they be past cure.
   And that makes so many bills, as in a desperate case, to be sent in to
   us. It is a far easier thing to send in a bill to a minister, when a
   child is spoiled and ruined in its tender years, than it is constantly
   to watch over them, and repress their ill inclinations betimes, and
   make them understand government, and subjection, and dependance, in
   their early days. But where the will of the child is the law of the
   family, and must govern all, no wonder if plagues and mischiefs, of
   this kind, are introduced and brought into families by this means.

   Divine wisdom hath taught us in such cases how to under stand the
   matter aright. "He that spares the rod hates his son:" fond parents
   think it love; but divine wisdom calls it hatred. And therefore, is the
   advice, in that same book, Proverbs xix. 18. "Let not thy soul spare
   for his crying." What! because he cries will you throw him into hell,
   will you abandon him to destruction? Not that there needs much of
   frequent severity, where there is a due prudence used in reference to
   such cases. I have known children brought up to men and women's estate,
   that never had a blow in their lives; nor was it needful. It would not
   be needful, if there were a steady awfulness in the deportment of
   parents towards them, so that they might, upon any thing that were
   really a miscarriage, understand a frown, a rebuke, a strange look. If
   there were that prudence used, that might be used, there would be
   little need of harshness and severity, unless upon very ill temper
   indeed; and they must be dealt with accordingly.

   But where all the care is to indulge a humour, and please the child;
   and where there is a disposition in parents, many times, to be proud of
   the ill dispositions of their children, as they appear in them, how
   many ill tempers are made worse? And how many good tempers are spoiled
   by this means? And the guilt and future miseries of the children will
   cry against their parents, not only in this world, but, perhaps, in the
   other too. And the truth is, parents would shew a great deal more mercy
   in that which is commonly reckoned harshness and severity: nay, I say,
   they would not be reckoned so cruel in breaking their childrens' limbs,
   in tearing their flesh, in pulling out their eyes, as they commonly
   are, in indulging their vicious, sinful dispositions and inclinations,
   in them, without a timely endeavour of cure, wherein the seed of those
   miseries are sown, and spring up so in this world, and in the other
   too. Again,

   (8.) They ought, in pursuance of the mentioned end, to instill the
   principles of religion betimes. Teach them betimes who made them, that
   great Supreme Being who is the Maker and Author of all things; teach
   them reverence and subjection to him: speak awfully before them, so as
   never to take that great name in vain; so as that your fear, your own
   fear, of the great God, whose name you bear, may be exemplary to them:
   as Jacob sware by the fear of his father, Isaac, when the important
   solemnity of the occasion called for an oath. Jacob had observed what
   Isaac's reverence of God was, and so called him "my father's fear." O
   teach your children to know God as their parents' fear. And so the
   other great principles of religion besides, which they are capable of
   understanding (if there be a due and diligent application), earlier
   than is thought; earlier than is commonly thought, at least: but the
   sooner the better: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when
   he is old he will not depart from it." Labour to season him betimes: so
   the wickedness of a corrupt nature is to be counterwrought. And then,

   (9.) Pray much for them. You that are, or maybe, parents, as you are
   so, or upon that prospect, let this be a matter of great concern
   between God and you. Pour out your souls in your closets, upon this
   account; especially such of you to whom God hath given children. And be
   sure,

   (10.) To set up and keep up family worship, family religion. Let this
   be an agreed thing between you; that as holy, good Joshua resolved, "I
   and my house will serve the Lord, whatever others do, we will serve the
   Lord." As a corrupt nature comes by birth, and wickedness springs up
   so, so it is nourished and cherished, in great part, by the ungodliness
   of parents. In families were there is no calling on the name of the
   Lord, O how doth it thrive! That wickedness that is natural, how doth
   it grow and improve in an irreligious family, a profane family! So doth
   the wickedness of this world grow, the wickedness of England, the
   wickedness of London. And the misery thereof is growing pari passu,
   with an equal pace. And if dreadful calamities are coming upon us,
   coming upon the land, coming upon this city, we have reason to
   apprehend here is the very source of all the mischief, even family
   profaneness. God is banished out of the families of the most: and what
   will this come to?

   I desire to bless God for it, that the ministers of this city, such as
   are united, and are wont to meet weekly, about the common concernments
   of their congregations, are awakened into a sense of this great and
   growing evil; and they have resolved to use their utmost endeavours to
   awaken the people of their several charges and congregations, about
   this very thing. And (God willing) you will have more of it ere it be
   long; that I believe there will be such a joint, agreed, common cry in
   London, against the wicked neglect of the worship of God in families,
   as hath not been for many an age past. I hope there will. And know, it
   is an agreed thing, that there shall, at some one time and, as near as
   may be, all about the same time. And so will, I hope, the faithful
   servants of Christ (at least) deliver their own souls. Yea, I hope God
   will bless this to be a means of great reformation in this city.

   For the evil as is feared (at least it is said to be matter of
   observation with some, for my part, I know it not, but it is matter of
   fear with many) is, that a great many professors of religion make no
   conscience at all of any such thing, as family duty; but prodigally
   throw away that time otherwise, which should be spent in the solemn
   worship of God in their families, with those of whom he hath committed
   the care and charge to them. And if what is designed happen, and do not
   produce a thorough and general reformation among us, it will produce a
   vindication of that justice, of that seventy, which we are to expect.
   For God will not be dallied with always; and I doubt, not much longer.
   That which hath been a seat of religion eminently in the world, in the
   eye of the past times, that religion should languish and dwindle in it,
   as it doth by the neglect of family government, even by persons
   professing godliness, and who would be counted a godly sort of people,
   is a very sad consideration.

LECTURE XL. [56]

   Secondly. I would now add some considerations to enforce what I have
   been pleading with you about. And,

   1. That which is obvious in the text--"Behold, I was shapen in
   iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me." Parents, they have
   transmitted a corrupt nature to their children. Into what agonies of
   spirit should it put us, to think with ourselves, "I have been an
   instrument in producing an heir of wrath, and of a divine curse. O!
   shall I use no endeavour to draw it under a blessing, and make it the
   subject of blessedness, now that we live under that gospel, in which we
   are called to blessedness?" But that call must be pursued; and God
   expects it should be so, in apt and suitable methods and applications,
   by such as he makes use of as instruments, one way or another, whether
   in private or more public stations, in order thereunto. And,

   2. Consider God's original, supreme, and sovereign interest in
   families, as he is the Founder of them, and as they are his plantation.
   "He sets the solitary in families." Psalm 68. 6. Consider this,
   together with the design of his forming of them; to wit, that he might
   have a godly seed still arising, from age to age, as you may see in
   that Malachi ii. 15. It was the very end and design of that fundamental
   relation in families, and unto families, the conjugal relation:
   "Wherefore did he make but one, when he had the residue of the Spirit?
   Why, that he might seek a godly seed." As if it had been said, These
   plantations are mine. This, the constitution of families, (in which the
   conjugal relation, is the fundamental relation,) speaks, upon the,
   first design of settling such a constitution as this. There lay open
   (as we must but be sure) to the foresight of the divine eye, what a
   general apostasy and defection there would be; and that a corrupt
   nature would be transmitted, from age to age, from generation to
   generation. But God did determine with himself, not, therefore, to
   abandon all to one common ruin: as if he should have said, "I will have
   an interest in this world, notwithstanding." And therefore, as this was
   the original design of the constitution of families, that he might have
   a godly seed, though the apostasy hath intervened, he will not quit his
   design: for his interest is still the same in its own nature. And
   therefore, this we must understand him continually to insist upon, as a
   sacred right to himself; that he will have this design pursued by all
   that will be subject to him, that will return into their state of
   subjection, and be willing to serve him in the several stations that he
   hath set them. He will have all endeavours used for transmitting of
   religion, as well as corrupt and sinful nature is transmitted, from age
   to age; though the one is done by a natural, the other is done by
   instituted means, followed with a blessing, and by influence from
   above: he will have this latter design carried on by the mutual and
   joint endeavours of parents, under the influence of his grace; as well
   as the former course is carried on unavoidably. But when no care or
   concern is had about this, the foundations of families are laid in a
   curse. And then,

   3. Consider, that it cannot but concern parents, such as are such, or
   may be so, to express a natural affection, and to endeavour to have
   that improved, by having it spiritualized, and improved to a spiritual
   purpose, as well as they are the means by which a natural corruption is
   conveyed, and transmitted to their posterity. "They have natural
   corruption from me; (they ought to think;) and shall there be nothing
   of natural affection? And shall I not labour to have that natural
   affection sublimated, and spiritualized, and improved, so as to aim at
   their spiritual and supernatural good? Shall they have nothing from me,
   but sin and death? or nothing besides the human nature which they have
   from me; nothing but what shall corrupt and spoil, make it the subject
   and seed-plot of sin, against God, and misery to themselves?" If there
   be any thing of natural affection working downward with the descent of
   natural corruption, that natural affection should aim at the true good
   of them whom nature hath so much endeared; and should, upon that
   account, take in the auxilia, draw in the aids and helps from heaven,
   by which that natural affection will become spiritualized; and so the
   more sincerely and entirely aim at, and the more fervently pursue, a
   design for the spiritual and eternal good of those who descended and
   sprung from us. And,

   4. It is to be considered, what an honour this doth derive upon the
   persons themselves, that shall be instrumental in this design. A
   glorious thing it is, to be a servant to God in so great a work as
   this; to recover out of the state of apostasy, those that come into
   that state by our means; to be an instrument, in the hand of God, to
   promote his kingdom in this world, in opposition to the dark kingdom of
   the infernal powers. How glorious a thing is it, to carry on a designed
   opposition against the work of the devil in this world! that when we
   know the aim and purpose of the great God, is to have, in all
   successions of time, a people for his name, I should be instrumental in
   promoting it! It is an honourable thing, a thing that draws a glory
   upon the persons, and upon the families, where religion doth thus come
   to take place, to take root, and is planted, and doth flourish. And
   again,

   5. It speaks an agreement and sameness, in a great measure, of mind and
   design, with the Redeemer. For he is to have his seed in this world,
   from which his word and Spirit are never to depart; Isaiah lix., latter
   end. And the matter is settled, by everlasting covenant, as you find it
   there: "This is my covenant, (saith the Lord,) My Spirit that is upon
   thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out
   of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of
   thy seed's seed, from henceforth and for ever." And so we know it hath
   been an agreed thing, as the matter is stated, (Isaiah liii. 11,)
   between the Father and him, that he shall see his seed, and the travail
   of his soul, and be satisfied therein: and that, as a recompense for
   his having undertaken the work of redemption, and accomplishing it,
   upon terms so painful, so expensive, so dolorous, so ignominious to
   himself. As if the Father had said to him, "Thou shalt have all this,
   this reward; thou shalt see thy seed, and the travail of thy soul, and
   be satisfied therein." Upon this, our Lord Jesus Christ cannot but be
   most intent to see a continual seed spring up to him, out of a seed of
   evil doers; out of an apostate race of men. Now, if we be intent upon
   this thing, it bespeaks a sameness of mind and design, between the
   Redeemer and us: which, how pleasant, how delightful, how comfortable,
   should it be to our reflecting thoughts! And again,

   6. It is further to be considered, that if there be no such design to
   promote godliness in families, that that may be transmitted from age to
   age, (though in a distinct and diverse way,) as the corrupt and sinful
   nature is transmitted, then, we can not but be doing our part to the
   promoting of ungodliness in the world ourselves. We shall do that, and
   nothing besides, nothing in opposition thereunto. For do but consider,
   as the case stands between God and man, there can be no medium between
   being for godliness, and being for ungodliness; we cannot be in an
   indifferency. If we are not, according to the uttermost of our power
   and capacity, for transmitting, and continuing of godliness in the
   world, we must be for the continuing of ungodliness. A horrid and
   fearful thought, if any would but allow it to take place! They can only
   be in an indifferency, in reference to any case whatsoever, that have
   no real concern therein, one way or other. But here, every one is
   concerned; and he must take a part: he must be for the promoting of
   godliness, or promoting its contrary. And therefore,

   7 According to this state of things in the world, they that do aim to
   contribute nothing to the transmitting of religion and godliness in the
   world, in opposition to the corruption of nature, which is so generally
   spreading through it, they are continually providing that there may be
   a war and rebellion continued and kept on foot, against heaven, from
   age to age, and from generation to generation. "He that is not with me
   is against me," saith the Lord. If you will not take God's side in this
   matter, you are fighting against him, and labour to do all that you
   can, that the rebellion against him, may not cease; but that there may
   be still a succession of new rebels, new enemies, from one age to
   another. And,

   8. You will herein, too, be constant accomplices and confederates with
   the prince of the apostasy; he that first fell from God, and that made
   it his design to involve all the world in the transgression, and in the
   consequent ruin; you will be continual accomplices with him. And this
   is, indeed, the state of every one's case, in these matters. Whoever
   will but consider with himself, if he be come to the use of his
   understanding, and hath some prospect, (though uncertain,) of a life's
   time to be run out in this world, he will find the world divided
   between two great lords, two great masters, two great fathers: that is,
   the true and Rightful Lord of all, he that made all; and to whom all
   belong; and that usurping prince of darkness, who is called, *' the god
   of this world," and whose children and seed wicked men (as such) are
   said to be. Why, every man, upon the prospect of entering upon the
   scene, the stage of this world, is to think with himself, "I must, in
   this case, either be with God, or against God. If I be not with God, if
   I be against him, I am with that horrid, usurped power, that is set up
   in opposition to him, with this world: and I fall in with that common
   destroyer, against the common Maker and Preserver of all things." This
   will be the state of your case, if you be not intent upon a design of
   counterworking this common corruption, which is descending in this
   world; you will be looked upon under no other notion but as an
   accomplice of hell against heaven. And,

   9. You will herein, falsify with God, after you have solemnly vowed and
   covenanted by your Christian parents. You have ordinarily been devoted
   and dedicated to God in baptism. To deal falsely and treacherously with
   a man, against the tenor of a covenant, is a horrid thing: but to break
   faith with God, is much more horrid!

   But you will say, You made no such vow; and what your parents did for
   you, how should that bind you? Why,

   (1.) It is very great ignorance to think, that parents cannot bind
   their children to any thing. Those that have the nearest natural
   interest in you, and whose understandings and wills are to be employed
   for you, when you have no understanding and will to use of your own, do
   you think they, from whom you sprang, have not a natural interest in
   you? How unreasonable and absurd a thought is that! In reference to all
   other concerns besides, have parents no disposal of their children? And
   may they dispose of them, or do for, or with them otherwise, and may
   they not dispose of them for their spiritual good? And again,

   (2.) It is every where counted a very horrid and barbarous thing, to
   endeavour to rescind the lawful act of a parent, if it were in my
   power, if I could do it. If I could alienate, or alter, what he hath so
   and so disposed; and if he have righteously disposed of it for me, to
   come after and labour to rescind and undo all that he hath done--this
   is barbarous and infamous, in common estimate, among men. And,

   (3.) It must needs be much more so as to God, or if he be concerned in
   the matter. As now for instance, Suppose a pious person, with an honest
   mind and design, hath dedicated such a part or portion of his estate to
   a pious use; suppose it be not mere charity, but a pious charity, that
   is, not designed for a superstitious use, but for a use truly pious,
   and to serve the interest of God and religion in the world; and a son
   comes after, and he labours to undo all this: you that would think it
   horrid, to alienate a piece of earth, dedicated to God by your parents,
   ought you not to think it horrid, to alienate a soul from God, which
   hath, as much as in them was, been dedicated to God by them too? I
   would not alienate a piece of earth, dedicated to God; but I would
   alienate myself, my soul, my body, dedicated to him. This no man should
   (if he had power) alienate. What was dedicated and sacred to a use
   truly pious, may not be alienated; and if not a portion of his estate,
   much less himself so dedicated, and given to God. But yet, further,

   (4.) It is to be said, that as this was not to be done, if it were in
   his power, so he cannot have such a thing in his power, to wit, in his
   rightful power: for every one was a debtor of his whole life and being,
   his soul and body, and his all, to God, antecedently to any such
   dedication. And therefore, when such a tender is made to God, it was
   but to tender and devote to him, what was his own by a more early
   title. "All souls are mine;" so he lays his claim universally to all
   the souls of men; and therein to the whole of them; for what are they
   besides a soul? what that is valuable or considerable besides? "All
   souls are mine, as well as the soul of the father, as the soul of the
   son." Ezekiel xviii. 4. He hath a nearer interest in them than a parent
   could have, before any such dedication: for a parent was not the parent
   of their spirit. They are the fathers of our flesh; but he himself Is
   the Father of spirits; the principal and most considerable thing that
   we have about us, or that belongs to our being. And therefore, when
   such a dedication was made, there was only a tender made to God, of
   what was his before; of what he claims an interest in originally. He is
   the Father of them, and they are his offspring. And again, further,

   (5.) This, in answer to that, is to be considered, that though
   inclination to good do not descend, yet, obligation to it doth descend,
   from fathers to children, and from the predecessors in a family, unto
   their successors. Not only obligations of justice and common right, but
   obligations of kindness and friendship. As, how ordinary is it for
   friendships and amities to descend from father to son, in families. And
   it is looked upon as a rude kind of thing, to be uncivil to my father's
   friend. And on which side, between families, among whom hath been a
   friendship, it first begins to fail, it always lies as an imputation
   upon that side. Great amity there was between such and such families;
   but now it is at an end, since such and such successors are sprung up
   there. On whose side the failure is, there commonly lies a very ill
   character. And it is a thing contrary to the dictates of common
   wisdom,--yea, and of the divine wisdom. "Thine own friend, and thy
   father's friend, forsake not," Prov. xxvii. 10. But how much less then,
   thy God, and thy father's God? If it be an indecency, and uncomeliness,
   and a very unfit thing, that is, contrary to the precept of studying
   whatsoever is lovely, and thinking of those things, to forsake my
   friend, and my father's friend, how much more horrid must it be to
   forsake my God, and my father's God? "My father's God shall not be my
   God!"

   And therefore, it is not so light a matter, as is commonly thought, to
   have the weight of that early dedication, lying upon one's score as a
   violated thing; as having dealt falsely in that covenant of God.
   Indeed, it is not only an evidence, but a cause of the languishment of
   religion in our days, that this is a thing so little thought of among
   Christians: "I was devoted to God early, given up to him with great
   solemnity; having these venerable names,--the name of the Father, the
   name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Ghost, named upon me, at my
   setting forth into the world." It speaks an apprehension of that thing
   itself, as if it were trivially done at first, if we make a trifle of
   it all our days afterwards: as if such a solemn transaction between the
   great Lord of heaven and earth, and his own dust, his own creatures,
   the works of his hands, were to be so lightly made of. Therefore, take
   we the weight of this upon our spirits. If we do not do, in our several
   stations and capacities, our uttermost to counter work this descending
   evil in the world, we do falsify the sacred covenant of God, in which
   we were early and preventingly bound to him, by the vow of parents
   concerning us. And then,

   10. It is the way, certainly, for us to lose all the comfort of
   domestical relations, when we are not driving on this design in our
   several stations: we lose by it, all the comforts of family relations.
   For what comfort can I take in having such and such relations, in a
   family, when, in the mean time, there is a contrariety, and a war,
   maintained and kept up between God and me? So that I can never eat or
   drink in peace, or converse in peace, or rise up, or lay down in peace;
   but still I have wrath from heaven upon me? This will infuse gall and
   gravel into all my enjoyments whatsoever. I am not serving God's
   design, for the promoting of godliness, in opposition to this growing
   and descending wickedness in the world: I do nothing towards it. This
   very reflection is enough to embitter all my comforts. And what are
   such and such relations to me, but confederates against God? They agree
   to sin together, and to carry on an interest against God together. For
   there can be no neutrality in such cases, as was said before. And then,

   11. This is but an ill provision for a day of accounting, which will
   come, whether we sleep, or whether we wake; whether we forget all such
   considerations, or whether we consider them. "Judgment lingereth not;
   and destruction slumbereth not." If I eat on, and drink on, and sleep
   on, judgment comes on with never a whit the slower foot. O! the
   seriousness of that interwoven counsel, in the discourse of the
   apostle, even with reference to this business of the matrimonial state.
   1 Cor. vii. 29, 30. "But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it
   remaineth, that both they that have wives be as if they had none; and
   they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though
   they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as if they possessed not; and
   those that use this world as not abusing it: for the fashion of this
   world passeth away."

   The time is short. That may have reference to families, and the world:
   families that were spoken of before and after; and the world, in the
   whole, which is spoken of there in express terms. The fundamental
   relation in families, it is measured by a short time; by a very short
   time. Where there hath been such a union lately contracted, it will
   shortly be broken; time measures it; and that time will have run to its
   period very speedily. The time is short: it remains, therefore, that
   they that have wives be as if they had none; and they that rejoice, as
   though they rejoiced not. They rejoice in having newly contracted such
   a relation: it is reasonable to understand it so, considering it the
   subject of the apostle's foregoing discourse; that joy will be as if it
   had not been, in respect of the grounds: and it ought to be so, in the
   mean time, in respect of the degree. That rejoicing, in having entered
   into such a relation, will soon be turned into weeping, as having lost
   it, or it having lost you, which comes all to one. And it is but a
   short time that measures all this.

   And do you think it strange, that that time would be counted short,
   which measures the time of a family, as it is made up of such and such
   persons now coexistent; or that measures the relation of two such
   conjugal relatives? Do you think it strange, that that should be spoken
   of, and counted a short time, when it is but a short time that measures
   the whole, and measures the duration of the whole--the fashion of the
   world passing away? As persons vanish, and families vanish, so is the
   world vanishing, all will be gone ere long. As the apostle John speaks
   in the like place, 1 John ii. 17. "The world passeth away, and the lust
   thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."

   Now while it is time, and but a short time, that measures all our
   affairs, and all our enjoyments, and all our designs, under the sun;
   time that will be soon done, and which will end in a general
   dissolution of all this world; a day, a time, "when the heavens shall
   pass away with a great noise, and the elements melt with fervent heat;
   and the earth, and all things therein, be burnt up and destroyed." I
   say, sure if this is certain to be the last catastrophe and end of all
   things, of what concernment is it to us, to consider how we may make a
   comfortable account when time expires, and when it is to be received,
   and with it, what I have been, and what I have done, in such or such a
   state and relation, in which I was placed in this world! There ought to
   be an account made daily: How can I lie down in peace at night, and not
   be capable of giving some good account that I have been doing somewhat
   for God, and for the interest of God, and religion, and godliness, in
   my station that day? But how shall I lie down in the grave, when a life
   time is wasted, and spent, and thrown away, and nothing done for God? I
   have rather served the interest of ungodliness, than religion, all my
   time in this world: and how shall I think of appearing before the
   tribunal of the Supreme Judge, when the end of all things cometh; and
   when I am beset with all the terrors of that day,--the heavens rolling
   up, and all the powers of them shaken; the earth all on fire, the
   elements all flaming round about me? And I have a life's time to review
   and look back upon, spent away in sin and vanity, with no design for
   God, and for the Redeemer; though I know that he had his design set on
   foot here in this world, with which I co-operated not, to which I was
   not subservient--nay, to which I have lived opposite in a stated
   course.

   Let all these things be weighed and put together; and sure we have a
   great deal to enforce this first instruction; that since corrupt nature
   is to lie certainly and constantly descending in this world, we would,
   as we ought, in our several stations and capacities, do our uttermost
   to counterwork that descending evil.

LECTURE XLI. [57]

   But now I shall carry the matter a little further; and as I have been
   hitherto shewing what those that are, or shortly may be, parents, ought
   to do themselves, in reference to their next descendants, that is,
   those that shall more immediately spring from themselves; so, I will
   shew you, too, what may and should be done, in order to a further
   descent, by those that may have the authority to dispose of their
   children in the conjugal state, with the expectation of a continual
   descent of human nature by them further and further,--that so, that
   corruption and pravity which cannot be prevented, to descend with it,
   may be, as much as is possible, corrected, and redressed in such an
   after descent.

   This that I am now to speak to, will especially concern such as have
   children to dispose of in the conjugal relation, who are judged meet
   for that state. And, indeed, it will equally concern such as are
   loco-parents, that have the parental trust devolved upon them, by the
   prudence of others, and their own undertaking.

   And as to such, I must still insist, that they are to observe the same
   measures that have been given in reference to persons who are,
   themselves, now entering the conjugal state, with the prospect of an
   offspring, to which human nature, when it descends, will go accompanied
   with a sinful pravity. And here, indeed, as to the case I am now to
   speak to, there are on each side two parties ordinarily to concur, or
   two persons in each party. There are the persons to be disposed of; and
   there are the persons that dispose of them. And I shall speak to the
   part of these that are to be the disposers, parents or loco-parents,
   guardians, trustees, who are to take care of settling such in the world
   in the conjugal state. In reference whereto, the things designed, in
   general, usually are, that mankind may be continued upon the face of
   the earth; and more especially, more particularly, that such and such
   families therein, or those that they are concerned or intrusted for,
   may be hulk and preserved: and (as the Psalmist speaks) "their houses
   may endure for ever; and their lands (if possible) still called after
   their own names;" as in that psalm xlix. 11. And this is a thing that
   may prudently and justly be designed, in its due subordination. If it
   be substituted in the room of the true and great design of heaven, or
   carried on without reference to God, and religion, and the transmission
   of a godly seed here, upon earth, then you see the censure of the Holy
   Ghost, upon this design, in the same context: "This their way is their
   folly, though their posterity approve their sayings." Sayings are
   doings here: the sayings of their minds and designs, together with
   acting conformably and correspondency thereunto. This their way is
   their folly; yet one age approves the former herein, and they that come
   after, run the same course.

   Here I must, in reference to this, insist, that their measures ought to
   be with consideration, that, with human nature, a sinful pravity will
   descend, and that this may be (as much as i$ possible) repressed: and
   so, as that God's design may he carried on concurrently, which he had
   from the beginning, in settling the conjugal state, and in planting
   families here on earth; that is, that he might seek a godly seed.
   Wherefore one, when he might have made many, having the residue of the
   Spirit, but that he might seek a godly seed? Mal. ii. 15. And this
   design he hath no more quitted, than he hath disclaimed his interest in
   this whole lower world, or, saith, "It ceaseth to be a part of my
   creation, or I cease to be the Lord and Owner of it. But inasmuch as
   there lies under our present consideration, the duty of such as have
   children to dispose of, with a prospect that they will have children,
   and that so a care ought to be extended as far as lies ordinarily
   within the compass of human endeavour; there ought, indeed, a care
   extending so far as the desire reacheth, and the main intention of the
   mind, a great deal further. But so much as I speak to, comes commonly
   within the compass of actual endeavour. It is ordinary for parents to
   survive unto the disposal of their children into the conjugal state,
   with expectation of children from them; and therefore, it is the duty
   of such that I am now generally to speak to.

   And I will tell you, in general, what it is to wit, that as much as in
   them is, to endeavour that religion be transmitted and descend, and go
   down in their families, and in the families for which they are
   concerned and intrusted. It is true, it cannot descend the same way as
   human nature, and the sinful pravity doth; that is, not by propagation:
   but it is to descend by pious education, as the means that God must be
   supplicated to co-operate with, and bless, for the implantation of a
   better principle, than could be propagated by nature. This sinful
   pravity, it comes by nature: this superadded principle must come by
   grace. But then, there are. means of grace in order to the obtaining of
   that grace: and this is the first and the readiest means; to wit, a
   pious education. And therefore, it ought to be the care of such as have
   children to be disposed of in the conjugal state. To speak a little
   more particularly,

   1. To endeavour, as much as is possible, that they may see them godly
   before they be married. As much, I say, as is possible to endeavour
   that. It can be very little satisfaction to the heart of a parent, (if
   it be so tender as the grace of God in it should make it,) to dispose
   of a child into such a relation, to a human creature, when, as yet,
   there is no appearance that it is come into a relation to God. "My
   child hath now a husband, or hath a wife, gotten for it; but hath not a
   God, not a Christ. This is a sad thought! I have taken care that it
   might have what is so unspeakably less necessary: but of that which is
   most necessary, I have taken no care; that is, to see that my child, my
   son, or daughter, was married to Christ: to see, that before the
   conjugal covenant, there was the evangelical covenant settled and
   established between God in Christ, and this poor child of mine." And,

   2. Their further care hereon ought to be, finding that there are some
   good appearances of pious inclinations, they do choose out such for
   them as will fall in with them, in the design of transmitting piety to
   their posterity: that I may have one for my son, or my daughter, that I
   believe, in my conscience, will make it their study and business, to
   educate their children in the knowledge and fear of God; that religion
   may run on in the family, and that corrupt nature may not descend
   alone.

   It is a very sad case when this is the very last part of the concern in
   such a matter as this: when the first thing thought of is, "Where shall
   I get a great fortune for my son; or how shall I marry my daughter into
   a great estate?" When this is the first care, is it like that precept
   of our Lord Christ--"Seek first the kingdom of God?" Matt. vi. 33. This
   is looked upon as the unam necessarium, the one thing necessary; a
   great fortune, an ample estate, a plentiful income: and as for religion
   and sobriety, if that he considered, it is considered on the by,
   collaterally, as if it were hut a trifle in comparison. And so,
   accordingly, are bargains driven on, as formal contracts, as for beasts
   in Smithfield; even for the very souls of young persons that have not
   judgment to choose for themselves, and that, (it may be,) have a great
   deal of reverence for those that are their guides, and have the
   disposal of them. They think they must trust their care and judgment,
   and do so. And they concern themselves only, how they may do well in
   the world, without considering, at all, what shall become of their
   souls; or how they may be exposed and given up for a prey; or what
   shall become of those that shall descend from them.

   This is so intolerable an evil under the sun, that we have reason to
   wonder at the divine patience, that it hath not, by vindictive flames,
   animadverted on such wickedness long ago. But we are to expect it will.
   And as it is the wickedness of the world, which that final
   conflagration must animadvert upon, and will, it can be upon no one
   thing more than this: this way and means by which wickedness hath been
   propagated in the world, from age to age, without any care or concern,
   by those that should have driven on a counter-design, in duty to the
   great Lord and Maker of this world; as if he had given it up to men
   only to sin in, and to indulge their sinful lusts in, for a short
   life's time; and then go down into the dust and die. This is a thing so
   contrary to the reason of mankind, (if that were attended to, and if
   men would commune with themselves,) that we cannot but wonder that
   vengeance hath suffered men to live so long upon the face of this
   earth, at such a rate: and we have no reason to wonder that such a
   determination is set, that this world shall end, as we are told it
   shall, by vindictive flames, consuming the inhabitants of this earth
   from off it.

   But I shall here, first, answer a question which may arise about this
   matter I have been speaking to; and then proceed to enforce that charge
   or duty which, I have said, doth belong to such whose case and concern
   I have been speaking of. The question is this: "Why, suppose I that am
   a parent, or a guardian, do not discern in my child, (son or daughter,)
   now grown up, and of whom I have some thoughts of disposing into the
   conjugal state; suppose I do not see in them any thing of a pious
   inclination; am I to endeavour to settle them, in that relation, with
   such a one that is judged sincerely pious. And to this I must say,

   1. That none ought to be rash and hasty in their judgments concerning
   others, who are pious, and who are not; at least, there ought to be a
   very careful abstaining from a positive judgment concerning any, that
   they are ungodly. What judgment we do pass, it is better, and safer, to
   err on the most favourable side. But we have a most express rule from
   our Lord himself not to judge; which is not to be understood, neither,
   in a simple, but comparative sense. "Judge not, that ye be not judged."
   We must not judge hastily, not judge rashly, not judge positively, and
   concludingly, without very clear and full evidence, that such a one is
   an ungodly man. But we are told afterwards, in the same chapter. Matt.
   vii. 16. that men are known by their fruits; so that, as we are to be
   slow and sparing in our judgment concerning others, especially on the
   severer part, that they are ungodly; so we ought to have, when we do
   judge, that which may be very clearly evidential: and then (as we do
   judge that there may be such evidence, as upon which we cannot but
   conclude so) it is out of question; otherwise, we should not know how
   to carry it towards such as are put under that mark, according as we
   are obliged to make distinction; and distinction even between them that
   have the form of godliness, but appear not to have the power of it,
   that we may turn away from them. And if there are many other things,
   mentioned in that context, that are inconsistent with the power of
   godliness, but do very well agree only with the form, the external
   form, we are to take our measures from thence, and thereby to endeavour
   to guide ourselves, as to our carriage and deportment, towards such:
   "Turn away from them," as the apostle there directeth. And therefore, I
   say, if matters do evidently appear, such and such do discover, by an
   habitual stated course and practice, that there is not only no serious
   godliness, but there is an enmity, a contrariety, an opposition, to it,
   they cannot comply with rules and ordinary duties that do belong to it;
   then, upon that, upon that supposition, I say,

   2. That they, with whom any such are concerned in such a treaty, will
   (as they ought to have) have such a design as you ought to have, and
   therefore will decline you. They will not have such a one for their
   son, or for their daughter: (if they be such as make conscience of what
   they do:) and so your question is answered. They will answer for you:
   "No, I will not have such a one come into my family, or for my son, or
   daughter, that appears an enemy to godliness, a rebel against Christ;
   that hath a fixed, habitual aversion to all serious religion. But,

   3. If they should not do so, not make that choice, for those whom they
   are concerned for, which they ought to make, you, for your parts, ought
   to do as you would be done unto; according to that general rule of our
   Lord, which carries so much of equity, so visibly in the face of it,
   that even some pagans have been fond of it: and one of the pagan
   emperors would have had Christ owned for a God, purposely upon that
   account, for that rule: Quod tibi non vis fieri, alter ne facias, what
   you would not that another should do to you, that do not to him.
   Carefully observe that rule in this case; "I would be loath my family,
   being a godly family, to admit an enemy to God and Christ into it; why
   then should I endeavour to thrust such a one deceitfully, and when the
   danger appears not to them, as it doth to me, into a godly family?"

   It is true, that if such were married to one another, in that case,
   this were not a thing that immediately concerns that relation, it not
   lying against the essential vinculum; as the apostle hath determined
   between Christians and avowed infidels: the nuptial bond holds, if it
   have been entered; but if it be to be made, it ought not to be made:
   for those that enter into that relation, are to enter it with a design
   of being "fellow-partakers of the grace of Christ, and helpers of one
   another heaven-ward;" and such as can comfortably join in prayer, and
   who are to carry matters so, as that their prayers may not be hindered,
   and the like. And if I am not to eat with a person visibly ungodly,
   much less am I to fall into so near a union, and converse with them:
   that is out of all doubt. And therefore, as I cannot in duty and in
   prudence, for the good of such as I am concerned for, suffer myself to
   be imposed upon, in such a case; so I am not to impose upon another. I
   would be loath to be so imposed upon, to have an enemy to God and
   godliness brought into my family, or united with my child: and I ought
   not to obtrude such a mischief as that upon another person, and another
   family. But when any thing in that kind is done, there must be so much
   the more serious, subsequent endeavours for redress; there must be the
   more earnest praying; and so much the more pressing advice given; and
   so much the more solicitude and care used, that such a one may be
   plucked out of the snare which, by too much unwariness, they have been
   betrayed into.

   And thus, having answered that question, I will lay before you some
   considerations that may be given to enforce all this. And pray
   consider,

   1. How little is to be alleged against it, against the carrying on this
   professed and avowed design, in the disposal of those I am concerned
   for, whether one's own children, or others that are intrusted to our
   care; I say, to avow this, as our design, to promote and transmit
   religion, and the interest of godliness in the world, consider how
   little is to be said against it. All that can be pretended against it
   is, that the custom and usage of the world is to look after a suitable
   match in point of estate, in the first place. It is very true, it is
   so. And so it is the custom of this world to forget God, and to carry
   it towards him, as if he were not the Lord of this world; and to cast
   his fear behind men's back; and to trample upon his interest; and to
   count religion, (which is the main concern of all men,) instead of
   their interest, their reproach and dishonour. This is the custom of
   this world. But let such things as these be put in the balance; and so
   the other considerations, which! intended, will fall in. As this, in
   the next place,

   2. That God doth manifestly insist upon this design still, of
   propagating religion in the world. You find that he doth provide that
   such a design should go on through all the successions of time. Our
   Lord Jesus Christ hath undertaken to be with them that shall be engaged
   in carrying on this design, to the end of the world. He hath set up an
   office on purpose; and therefore, the design is not laid aside, nor
   ever will be laid aside, of transmitting religion in the world. And how
   dutiful a thing, and how glorious a thing is it, to offer one's self as
   an instrument, within the compass of one's own sphere, to serve such a
   design as this!

   For let but conscience be appealed to in the case, Do we not find, that
   God hath a design to keep religion in the world, from age to age? What
   doth he continue this world for? Is it only that it may continue in a
   rebellion against him, from generation to generation, when it is
   impossible it should subsist an age, or a moment, without his
   sustaining influence, when we have so much assurance given us, that it
   is upon the account of Christ's interest, that this world is kept from
   dissolution all this while? It is by him that all things do subsist,
   and consist. Therefore, undoubtedly, God hath this design still. What
   serves that gospel for, that we live under, and the ministry and
   ordinances of it? And when we know that God hath such a design, shall
   not that which is his design, be our principal design? or shall we
   presume to disagree with him about our principal end?

   Indeed, it is very true, if he had made a declaration from heaven--"I
   will have no more to do with this world; I will save no more souls in
   it; I will leave all to follow the inclination of their own hearts, and
   to walk and live in that darkness which they love, and will have no
   more concern with them:" if there had been, I say, such a declaration,
   then all thoughts and care of this kind, that I am speaking of, would
   have been superseded. For it is impossible for any to act rationally,
   with despair. Where there is no hope, there can be no design. But when
   we know that that is none of the case, but God hath a design to
   continue religion and godliness in this world, from age to age, I am a
   wretch, if I will not make his design my principal design; or if any
   thing shall be greater in mine eyes than that. And again, consider,

   3. That if I do not do my utmost, within my sphere and capacity, for
   the serving this design of God, I do certainly make myself a party
   against him: for if there he a continual descent of human nature,
   without a prospect of any means to cultivate it, and correct the
   exorbitancies of it, in its further. descent, this is a continuation of
   the rebellion against God; when there is only a provision made, that a
   rebellious nature may descend, and no more; nothing with it; no
   corrective with it.

   But what a monstrous thing is this! when such care is taken to correct
   the exorbitancies of nature in inferior kinds; vegetative nature,
   sensitive nature. Men take care of their gar dens, of their flowers, of
   their trees: and (as the divine poet, Herbert, saith) let weeds choke
   their sun. How monstrous is this! Into what a wilderness doth
   uncultivated and uncorrected nature grow! You find it in inferior
   kinds. If nature be not regulated, rectified, even vegetative nature,
   it will all be over-run with weeds, and better plants grow wild. The
   protusions of nature, if no way regulated, they become very ungrateful
   and uncomely. And when we find how the case is, as to rational nature,
   what cultivation that needs, that it may be susceptible of the
   implantation of such a better principle that shall be governing, man
   becoming, without it, "as a wild ass's colt," as the Scriptures speak.
   O! who can endure the thought, that so it should be with what descends
   from me; that what descends, shall have descending with it seeds of
   enmity, and rebellion, against the Majesty of heaven only; but nothing
   concomitant towards the cure and the remedy of so horrid an evil.

   To have a nature poisoned with enmity, an envenomed nature, even
   against heaven, running on, if I do not use my utmost care and concern,
   that as there shall be a continual descent of human nature, so that the
   correctives may accompany it, and go along with it, I do make myself a
   party against God and godliness. For I am sure that the uncultivated,
   and impure corrupt nature will be continually carrying on that war, and
   tumultuating in fresh rebellions, against heaven. And so that makes me,
   by neglect, a party: I betray the interests of God in that matter. And,

   4. Let it be considered too, what horrid cruelty this is towards our
   own bowels, or such as I have otherwise undertaken the care of, visibly
   to throw away their souls; to seem not to care what becomes of them;
   whether they shall have any helps God ward, or heaven-ward, yea or no.
   No concern that whatever they shall bring forth, in all probability,
   and according to visible appearance, is only brought forth for the
   destroyer; all children of perdition only in view. And it is, in the
   last place, to be added,

   5. That if any such persons would allow themselves to consider, that
   have such a concern upon them, or who are so in trusted with the
   disposal of young ones, either their own, or others committed to them,
   that will finally be found most of all cruel to their own souls. For
   how shall such, at last, lie down in peace, when they come to make up
   their accounts with God. "Such and such opportunities I had to serve
   the God of my life in this world, which I have lost; and I have thrown
   away such, whose souls I was concerned for, to have taken care of, even
   as my own." For we are to love our neighbours as ourselves: and much
   more those that are nearly related. O! the wounds and gall, and the
   terrors of spirit, wherewith (if the matter be reflected on) such must
   lie down at last. And the case is worse if it be not reflected on.

   But then, there is somewhat to be said, too, to the other sort of
   persons that are concerned in this same case; and that is, the persons
   to be disposed of. All that I have said hitherto, refers to the
   disposers. But for them that are disposed of, it is not fit they should
   come into such a relation as that, till they can use some thoughts of
   their own, and so be capable of understanding what their duty is in
   such a case. And,

   1. It is manifestly their duty to be very flexible towards parents and
   guardians, when they see they have a visible design of their spiritual
   and eternal welfare, in the first place; and that which they are
   chiefly concerned for. And,

   2. It is their duty to be inflexible, if they find that such as are
   concerned for them, have a design to throw them away; that they do not
   care as to what concerns their souls, and their spiritual estate, so as
   they may marry into an opulent condition in this world. In that case, I
   say, they ought to be in flexible: but dutifully and submissively,
   still. They ought to carry it With decorum, and not to be insolent in
   their refusal of those offers that are made them by parental authority,
   or in opposition thereunto; but with modesty and humility, still to
   dissent, still to disagree: "I will not so venture my soul upon an
   ungodly person; or where there is no hope I shall have help Godward, or
   heavenward."

LECTURE XLII. [58]

   Thirdly. [59] It may be of use to us, to let us see how reasonable and
   righteous it is, that the conceptions and births of human creatures
   should be ordinarily attended, from age to age, with such dolours as we
   find they are. It is not to be repined at, that when such conceptions
   and births are in sin and iniquity, they should be also accompanied
   with terrors, with such pangs and agonies, as are commonly experienced.
   For it ought to be considered, what the productions are. What are the
   productions when a human creature is brought forth into this world?
   Why, a thing shapen in iniquity, and conceived in sin. And abstractly
   considered, and antecedently to supervening grace, it is a monstrous
   production. Any such production, it is a monstrous thing. A reasonable,
   intelligent creature produced into being, with a radical enmity against
   the infinite and supreme Good, the Fountain of all excellency and
   perfection. Consider it, I say, antecedently to supervening grace, and
   every human product is a monstrous one. As reason is yet but radical
   and seminal, so is corruption, so is malignity against God. "Estranged
   from the very womb," as that expression is, psalm lviii. 3.

   Therefore, this lot is to be submitted to, with so much the more equal
   mind, remembering that this was part of the first sentence, when sin
   did first spring in the world, that conception and production should be
   in sorrow. That such sickness, such pangs, such agonies, should so
   constantly attend human conception and birth; we are not to repine at
   it, as if it were an unreasonable, an unrighteous thing: but we are to
   consider the reason of this and that; God will have a continual
   memorandum kept on for the putting us in mind, from age to age, what
   the nature is, that is descending and running down in this world, from
   age to age.

   And that this should be the harder lot of that sex upon which it falls,
   the apostle gives this account--that that was the first deceived sex,
   first in the transgression, 1 Tim. ii. latter end. And the indulgence
   that is superadded, ought to be so much the more gratefully
   acknowledged; to wit, that there is so particular discovery of grace
   with reference to that sex: "She shall be saved in child-bearing, if
   she continue in faith, in holiness, in purity, in sobriety, "and in
   love, the immediate product of that faith; a heart united with God, by
   that "faith which works by love." We read it, f( charity," which
   commonly is understood to carry a reference especially unto a fellow
   creature. But there is no reason for that restriction in the native
   signification of the word itself. If she continue in faith, and love,
   with holiness and sobriety, she is in a safe state, notwithstanding all
   the pangs and dolour, and agonies, which, according to the original
   unreversed sentence, must be expected to be in the way. But again,

   Fourthly. We may further learn, hence, by way of use, with what
   patience, and meekness, and wisdom; and with what considering minds,
   parents should observe and bear the sickness and death (when that case
   comes) of their children in their younger and more tender age. It
   requires much grace, much wisdom, a very serious and considering mind,
   to carry it equally and aright, in reference to such cases when they
   fall out: that a poor child that hath lately peeped into this world, is
   presently struck with some distemper or another, as soon as it
   breathes, it languishes, and, it may be, dies; which is, you know, a
   very common case: the far greater part being hardly thought to outlive
   infancy, who are born into this world. These languishings end in death
   more commonly, than in recovery and consistency in health. What is the
   reason of all this?

   Why humanly, indeed, they are apt to think it very strange, who are
   short-sighted creatures, and measure all things by the short line of
   time, and confine all those thoughts and apprehensions of things to
   this present world. But we are to consider, that when such a creature
   appears first upon the stage, it appears a creature tainted with sin;
   so it brings death with it, even from its very birth, into this world.
   "Death passeth over all men, inasmuch as all have sinned:" and sure,
   infants must be included in that all; and so they must be understood to
   be sinful creatures; to wit, that this radical evil hath tainted their
   natures, as soon as they have the human nature.

   This is a case, therefore, about which we are not to contend, but which
   we ought to set ourselves to improve, and turn to gain. Is such a
   creature, as soon as it is horn, a sinful, impure creature? Why, we
   must consider, that sin refers to eternity. I pray mind, that every
   thing of sin against God, it implies a reference to eternity, and to
   another world. Sin never reacheth its end and term here in this world.
   They that sin in this world, they are to give an account in the other:
   and that obey, and do comply, and fall in with the terms of the gospel,
   (the only prescription and relief in the case of having sinned,) they
   are to have their reward in another world. Sin, if it lie upon the
   sinner, turns to a miserable eternity in another world. Sin done away
   by expiation and by satisfaction, turns to a blessed eternity in
   another world. Do not think, therefore, that such creatures were
   finally made for this world. It would be an accountable riddle, that
   infants should but look into this world, and presently fall sick, and
   (as commonly it doth) that sickness end in death, if human nature were
   made for this world only. But this is to be considered, when such a
   creature comes into being, here is a production never to cease; a thing
   lately come into being, never to go out of being more: and that this
   world is only a vestibulum, an introduction into another world, which
   never dissolves, and wherein, whether our state be good or bad, they
   never change.

   It ought hereupon to be considered, further, (that so such a case as
   this may be improved unto advantage,) it is improved to great
   advantage, if we consider what such a creature was made for; and
   considering it as a fallen creature, or sinner, what this sin it hath
   about it, hath reference to. It hath reference to eternity. All sin
   hath that reference.

   But it will be of further improvement, if it be also considered by
   parents, in such cases, as to what tendency they usually have towards
   their children, when they are sick, and with what solicitude and fear
   they used to be vexing and disquieting their minds, lest they should
   die: yet they ought to be instructed, hence, to have a tenderness in
   reference to their spiritual maladies, and a like concern and dread of
   their dying eternally. Here would be a great improvement. "O! what a
   tenderness have I for my child when it is sick. Why, this distemper
   doth but attack the flesh, frail, mortal flesh, that was formed out of
   the dust so newly; and must, sooner or later, return to it again: but
   my child hath an immortal spirit in it too; and that is tainted with
   sin: it hath its worst and most dangerous distemper within, O! what
   cries, what supplications, should I send up to the Father of spirits,
   and Father of mercies, that he would cure these spiritual maladies?"
   And whereas, you an; afraid that your child will die; you are to be
   more afraid lest it should die eternally.

   And labour to consider aright, the grounds you have of reasonable hope,
   in reference to this case. It is a case that pa rents ought not to
   consider with despair. Those that are themselves in covenant with God
   through Christ, the promise is to them, and to their seed: and they
   have a great deal more reason to hope, than they have to despair. And
   for ought I see, as great reason to hope concerning their children
   dying in infancy as they have to hope concerning themselves. The
   covenant of God in Christ doth not signify nothing. And whereas, that
   age is incapable of covenanting for itself, if such a one, growing to
   maturity, do not disclaim, but stand to the covenant of his or her
   parents, it holds firm and unalterable. And, in the mean time, while
   there is no capacity, or possibility of disclaimer, we have no reason
   to think there can be any failure on the other part, but, according to
   the tenour and constitution of God's covenant, the infant, during its
   infant state, is considered as a branch in the root; and before it be
   capable of treating and transacting for itself with God, it is treated
   for acceptably and successfully by a holy and believing parent. And
   therefore, such a case, when it falls out unto godly pa rents to have
   their children languishing, even in their infancy, many times even unto
   death, they should consider what an admirable, strange thing it is:
   "This creature, as it came from me, came into this world an impure
   thing, a polluted thing, A child of wrath by nature; now, how is it
   numbered among the children of the Most High, and adjoined to the
   general assembly, (when it is gone from hence,) to the innumerable
   company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect! What a
   change is this! So impure a creature as it came from me, is become now,
   all of a sudden, so glorious a creature!"

   And it is further to that purpose, to be considered, What did God make
   such a creature for? Why, what do you think he made it on purpose to
   please me? If I be the parent, the pleasure I take in it, is but a
   collateral and secondary thing. Bat do we yet need to be taught that
   God made all things for himself? And that it may be good indeed, when
   such strokes do befal families, children lopt off, one branch after
   another, (it may be the single one,) to consider whatsoever a
   providence may specially animadvert upon, and if there be any thing
   evident in view, it ought to be considered; it ought to "be well
   considered and taken to heart. Yet, it is possible there may be a
   vulgar error incurred in this matter too: that is, in thinking that the
   principal design of any such dispensation was, or must be, the
   affliction and punishment of the holy parent. That ought to be
   considered, where there is no notorious delinquency to be reflected
   upon. I say, it ought to be considered as some end, but not as that
   principal end, of such a dispensation: for as the principal end of
   God's making such a creature was not to please me; so the principal end
   of his taking such a creature out of this world, was not to displease
   me; but to glorify himself: and that end cannot be in this world, for
   which he hath made such a creature.

   And it ought to be considered, that his right in it, is more than mine,
   infinitely. If any of you should put a child to nurse, and it grows up
   under the nurse's care, and she is pleased with it, takes complacency
   in it; and because she doth do so, when you call for your child home,
   she will not part with it, because it pleaseth her; surely, you would
   think that your right and interest in the child are superior to her's:
   and her's (whatever it is) is not to be considered in competition with
   your's; and, your's is far less to be considered in competition with
   God's; your's is far more inferior. And therefore, there ought to be a
   grateful resentment, not without sense, not with stupidity; but with
   serious and apprehensive minds, and having the state of the case lying
   in view before you as it is. And therefore, I add,

   Fifthly. That the miseries of this world ought not to amaze us. We are
   not to think it a strange thing, that this lower region should be a
   region of so much wretchedness and carnality, as it is found to be,
   from age to age: for is not every one that is born into it, born a
   sinner? And whereas, none can bring a clean thing out of an unclean,
   who can hope to bring a quiet thing out of an unclean? Purity and
   peace, pollution and disturbance go together. Every one brings into
   this world, not only that which is troublesome to himself, but that
   which is troublesome to others, too, with whom he hath to do. They
   bring that with them into this world, which must make it an unquiet,
   stormy region to them. Our greatest troubles (with every one) are born
   with us. And this is the common case, and cannot be otherwise, when we
   consider that sin, which every one brings with him into this world,
   doth dissolve the union between God and the soul, and breaks it off
   from God. A sinner, as such, is loose from God. And therefore, this
   would bring, from age to age, in a state of apostasy and separation
   from God, that which we see to be the consequent thereof, a universal
   confusion of our very nature within itself, and of all men (as they
   fall into any kind of conversation with one another) towards one
   another too. This cannot bat be, hereupon, a heap of confusion, a mere
   chaos.

   How can it be otherwise with creatures fallen from God? If man that is
   born of a woman be an unclean thing, (as Job xiv. 4.) then, (as the 14
   chapter begins,) it is not at all strange, that man that is born of a
   woman should be of few days, and full of trouble. So many such
   creatures as are produced, and brought forth into being in this world,
   so many fountains of misery and wretchedness are produced. Think of the
   vast numbers of the inhabitants of this earth, and every one, even from
   his very infancy, is a fountain both of impurity and misery. And
   therefore, it is not strange that so many fountains should deluge this
   world, from age to age, both with wickedness, so as that it may well be
   said to lie therein, and (as that which is most connatural thereunto)
   with misery also.

   And it is, hereupon, to be the result of our thoughts, when we consider
   with ourselves, what a miserable region this world is: this ought, I
   say, to be the result of our thoughts: it is all natural, it is all
   most genuine; if we see early discords in families, when a family is
   planted, young plants springing up in it; if there are quarrellings,
   janglings, fallings out, perpetual animosities, even among those nearer
   relatives in families; as the poet observed long ago--Fratrum concordia
   rara, seldom is there any agreement among brethren; those that are
   branches of the same root. If we look further into larger societies,
   cities, kingdoms, or nations, they are all continually full of
   confusion, from age to age; and it is from hence, that the wretchedness
   of this world, which springs up from as many fountains as there are men
   and women upon earth, and these fountains, from their very infancy, are
   "like the troubled sea, whose waters cast forth mire and dirt," as the
   prophet speaks: "There is no peace saith my God to the wicked." That
   wickedness which overflows the world, cannot but make it an unquiet and
   gloomy region. And therefore, again,

   Sixthly. We may further learn, how unreasonable and unaccountable a
   thing it is, that men should be in love with this present world. It is
   indeed, stupendous to think, that our minds should so cleave to so
   horrid a thing as this world is; should be set upon it, that they will
   not run from it; that here we think of taking up our rest! O! think,
   what we ourselves were, and what the rest of mankind is "a generation
   of vipers," poisonous creatures, of an envenomed, malignant nature. If
   we find that we have a design, any desire, any hope or prospect of a
   better state, methinks, we should not affect to live among such
   creatures, and continue ourselves when a cure is to be hoped for; when
   we understand the design of grace, that it will make such as comply
   with its methods, pure, and holy, and glorious creatures ere it be
   long: but not here, but incohatively and imperfectly only. When I
   consider this, methinks we should be quite out of love with this world,
   and say with ourselves, "This cannot be our rest, for it is polluted,"
   as in that Micah ii. 10. O! let us be up and begone as soon as we can
   have a fair exit; and make it our business while we must stay here, as
   much as is possible for us, to keep from the corruptions that are in
   this World, and to get, as much as in us lies, this impure fountain of
   sin dried up; and to be waiting with earnest, and most desirous
   expectation, for a translation into that place where there shall be no
   more sin, but perfect purity: nothing to interrupt and hinder the
   closest union, and sweetest pleasures, and most delightful intercourse,
   between God and us. "He that hath this hope purifieth himself as God is
   pure:" the hope of being like God, and seeing him as he is, 1 John iii.
   3. referred to the immediately foregoing verse. Which being made like
   God, and seeing him as he is, we know this present state admits not of.

   Seventhly, We may further learn, hence, to admire the divine patience
   towards this wretched world, that he hath spared it so long, is so
   indulgent to it; while wickedness is so continually propagating an
   enmity, rebellion, and war, against himself, from one generation to
   another. We ought to consider the divine patience in this, both as
   great and as wise. As great, to look upon it abstractly, it is
   wonderful patience, that God should bear with such a world, that is
   transmitting continual wickedness and enmity against himself from age
   to age, when he hath it so perfectly in his power to put a stop and
   period to all this, at his own pleasure. It is great patience. It is a
   very great thing.

   But we ought also to consider it, too, that it is the patience of a
   God; and then it must be wise as well as great. Wise with reference to
   somewhat else, as well as great in itself. It cannot be, but that the
   reference of this patience must be to some what else, to some God-like
   design; otherwise, would he sustain a sinful world, and let sinners
   beget sinners, and propagate a rebellion and war against himself, from
   age to age, if he had not some great meaning in all this? Why, there
   will be glorious results out of it, which, by how much the less our
   under standings are capable of comprehending it, with so much the more
   patience, and resignation, we should wait for it. It will be found at
   last a thing worthy of God, to have borne, with so much patience, the
   wickedness of this world so long. But then,

   Eighthly. We are from hence to reckon, too, that this state of things
   must not last always, when this is the constant course and common case
   that, from age to age, impure creatures are begotten of impure
   creatures, conceived in sin, shapen in iniquity, we may conclude upon
   it, that this course will have an end. And we are not to think it
   strange, if it should have such an end as the Scriptures of truth, tell
   us, it will have; that is, that a day will come, "when the heavens
   shall be rolled up as a scroll, and the elements melt with fervent
   heat; and all things therein shall be consumed and burnt up, as it is
   in that 2 Peter, iii. at large. We are not to think this strange or
   unworthy of God, that he should design such a way, to put a period, at
   last, to the generations of men on earth, when they are so continually,
   so long as they last, handing down and transmitting wickedness and war
   against heaven, from generation to generation. It is never to be
   thought, that this can last always. Therefore, how much the more wicked
   we observe the world to be, with so much the more awe, trembling, and
   dread we should consider what is coming--that day of the perdition, and
   of the destruction of ungodly men; this world being reserved unto tire
   against that day. But again,

   Ninthly. We are further to learn, how admirable a thing it is, that in
   the mean time, God should be raising up to himself a divine offspring,
   out of an impure race of creatures; (Be they as they are, and as they,
   from age to age, are born in sin, and brought forth in iniquity, yet,
   saith God, "I will have my part and share among them;") that he should
   have assigned to a Redeemer his seed, ("He shall see his seed," Isaiah
   liii. 10,) even out of this corrupt seed, this seed of evil doers. And
   whereas, according to the natural state of the case, (as it is stated
   before,) man in his first apostasy being an accomplice with the devil,
   this world is entirely become the devil's family: "You are of your
   father the devil." John viii. 44. So men, morally considered, are. In
   respect of their naturals (it is true,) God is the Father of their
   spirits; but in respect of their morals, lapsed, corrupted man, is the
   devil's seed, and so, antecedently to grace, this world was become the
   devil's family: but now, that God should raise up to himself a family
   out of this family; that there should be a diverse and contrary seed
   springing up, even amidst the other, and out of it, opposite to the
   other, and having its particular and distinct character, this is
   admirable! As the apostle tells us, "Herein the children of God, and
   the children of the devil are manifest." There is a manifest,
   discernible difference between them. There is no doubt, they must needs
   differ, beyond all that can be thought, who are of so vastly different
   parents.

   But here is the wonder,--that God should design to raise up to himself
   such a seed, out of such a world, out of such a race! that he did not
   rather choose to abandon this (one) when he was gone off from him: and
   when he could, by a word, have raised up another pure, holy, innocent
   creature through out. No: but his design was to defeat the device and
   contrivance of the devil; he thought to have this seed, all this race
   of creatures entirely off from God: No, this shall not be; he was
   resolved he would herein deceive the deceiver; and (as to this design
   of his) destroy the destroyer;--destroy him that had the power of
   death, and make a fool of him.

   This, (as I noted in the opening of the text to you) was a course most
   eligible to the Supreme Wisdom, not to make a direct regression of any
   of his works, by meeting with opposition and a design driven on against
   him. But he resolves to proceed in the natural course that was laid out
   at first, and to counterwork that arch-enemy, the first, the grand
   apostate; and to carry on his own design, against his design; and to
   turn all to honour and glory at last: even into matter of the highest
   triumph over the defeated and disappointed destroyer of souls. And this
   is that which we should consider, with wonder and reverence, that God
   should have such a design as this in hand, and continually kept on
   foot, to raise to himself a pure, and holy, and divine seed, (which
   shall at length be perfectly so,) out of such an apostate degenerate
   race. And,

   Tenthly, This lets us see the necessity of regeneration. Is man such an
   impure creature, even from his very original, from his conception and
   birth? Then he must be new made. If any thing shall be made of him to
   good purpose, lie must be made over again. This shews us of how
   absolute necessity it is, that there should be not only in discourse,
   but in fact, that great mystery of regeneration, belonging to our
   religion. Is man now, from the beginning, such an impure thing? (the
   great God beholding this,) there is nothing to be made of this
   creature, unless he be new made. Is he born such a thing? he must be
   new-born. Born he is, of earthly parentage: but "he must be born from
   above," as that word admits to be rendered, John iii. 5. But yet,

   Eleventhly. It also shews the kindness, as well as the necessity, of
   this regenerating work; by how much the more necessary, by so much the
   more kind. How admirable grace is there in it; that when the exigency
   of the case required that this creature should be made and born over
   again; I say, when the case required such a thing, God should so
   graciously vouchsafe it? This is admirable grace! "We were sometimes
   foolish, disobedient, serving divers lusts and pleasures;" slaves in
   our birth; born slaves. "But when the kindness and love of God
   appeared, not by works of righteousness which we had done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed upon us abundantly, through
   Jesus Christ our Lord." Tit. iii. 4, 5. Consider the grace of
   regeneration, how gracious a work it is, that God, who had no need of
   such creatures, creatures that could add nothing to him, should
   condescend to such a thing, to let that holy and pure Spirit of his,
   come, amidst all their impurities, with his own holy light and
   influence, upon creatures that he might have abhorred to touch with:
   that the holy and pure Spirit should shed his light and influences, (so
   pure things amidst so much impurity,) there to regenerate, there to
   renew, there to form, there to reform--O what grace is this! And,
   lastly,

   Twelfthly. We may further collect, hence, how glorious a work
   regeneration or renovation must be, when that shall take effect.
   "Behold, I make all things new." Rev. xxi. 5. Who would expect that
   such a state of things as this, should come out of such a state as this
   world was degenerated into, when every particular creature that
   inhabits it, was a fountain of impurity and misery to itself, and to
   the rest? That there should be such a thing laid in the divine
   counsel--"Well, I will new make this world; there shall be such a thing
   as new heavens, and a new earth, wherein righteousness shall dwell:"
   With what wonder and transport should we think of this, that God will
   have so glorious a world, out of a world so lost and sunk in impurity
   and death, as this world is!

   But thus far, we have been considering the state of the apostate
   children of men--the fall of the first man--the fall state of men,
   and--the equity and righteousness of the divine procedure in all this.
   It remains, in the next place, to come now to that which I last
   observed, by way of use, will lead us more directly to consider; and
   that is, what hath been designed, and what is done, and is doing, in
   order to the recovery of this impure, this lost, and lapsed creature.
