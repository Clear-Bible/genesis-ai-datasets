PREFACE.

   IN this edition, the work has been carefully revised by the author, and
   many additions made to the testimonies adduced in the former editions;
   and also several important docuIments not contained in the former
   editions have been placed in the appendix. Some alterations have also
   been made in particular passages, but not of sufficient importance to
   require specification.

   In the London edition of this work by the Rev. Doctor Morison, some
   complaint was made of the want of references sufficiently distinct, to
   the authors from which the testimonies have been taken. In most cases,
   the works from which they have been derived are mentioned; and in a
   popular treatise of this kind, which has more the character of a
   compilation than of a work of original research, it is not deemed
   important to burden the margin with many notes of reference; which
   indeed are seldom used when most abundant.

   The author has freely availed himself of all the information within his
   reach; but the authors to whom he is especially indebted are, Cosins's
   Scholastic History of the Canon of the Old Testament--Jones's New
   Method of Settling the Canon of the New Testament--and Lardner's
   Credibility of the Gospel History--The Isagoge of Buddæus--The
   Thesaurus Philologicus of Hottinger, and Prideaux's Connection. Dr.
   Wordsworth's work on the Canon of the Old and New Testaments, and
   Routh's Reliquiæ have also been consulted. Several valuable works on
   the Canon have been published in Great Britain, and also in this
   country, since the first edition of this work; but, though more
   valuable for the scholar, none of them, in the judgment of the author,
   are such as to supersede this as a popular treatise, which can be read
   with advantage by the unlearned as well as the learned. In a Scotch
   edition of this work, a copy of which the author has seen, there is an
   important error in giving the author's Christian name in the title
   page. Instead of Archibald, they have put Alexander; making the first
   and second name the same. The only reason for mentioning this is, lest
   some doubt should hereafter arise respecting the genuine authorship of
   the volume.

   As the design of this work is to ascertain where the revelation of God
   is to be found, it is assumed usually that the whole of divine
   revelation has been committed to writing. But there are many under the
   Christian name who strenuously maintain, that an important part of the
   revealed will of God has been handed down through the Church by
   tradition. It therefore seemed necessary, in order to render the work
   complete, to examine the claims of tradition; in which the author has
   departed from the common method of treating this subject. And as the
   Jews, as well as the Romanists, pretend to have received an Oral Law,
   handed down from Moses by tradition, a chapter has been devoted to this
   subject, and another to the traditions of the Church of Rome.

   As the inspiration of the gospels of Mark and Luke had been called in
   question by John David Michaelis and others, and the author could find
   no satisfactory answer to the objections of this learned writer, he
   felt it to be a duty to endeavour to vindicate these books of the New
   Testament, and to prove that they have a right to a place in the Canon;
   where in fact they had always stood. And he has been gratified to learn
   that his arguments on this subject have received the approbation of
   learned and pious men. The Rev. Dr. T. H. Home has inserted the
   substance of them in his "Introduction to the New Testament," and the
   Rev. Richard Watson has extracted a part of them and inserted them in
   his Theological Dictionary.

   There never was a time when the friends of the Bible as an inspired
   volume had a more important duty to perform in its defence, than at the
   present. The assaults upon the plenary inspiration of the sacred
   Scriptures are, perhaps, more dangerous, because more plausible and
   insidious, than when divine inspiration is openly denied. On this
   subject the friends of revelation must be firm, and not yield an inch
   of the ground hitherto occupied by the orthodox. "If the foundations be
   destroyed, what can the righteous do?"

   If this volume may be in any measure useful in the defence of divine
   revelation, the author will not regret the labour bestowed upon it.
   With an humble prayer for its success he commits it to the Christian
   public.

   A. Alexander.

INTRODUCTION.

  THE IMPORTANCE OF ASCERTAINING THE TRUE CANON OF HOLY SCRIPTURE.

   THE Bible includes a large number of separate books, published in
   different ages, during a space of more than fifteen hundred years. Each
   of these books when first published formed a volume; or at least, the
   writings of each author were, in the beginning, distinct; and if they
   had continued in that separate form, and had been transmitted to us in
   many volumes instead of one, their authority would not, on this
   account, have been less, nor their usefulness diminished. Their
   collection into one volume is merely a matter of convenience; and if
   any persons choose now to publish these books in a separate form, they
   cannot with propriety be charged with casting any indignity on the word
   of God.

   Hence it appears that besides general arguments to demonstrate that the
   Bible contains a divine revelation, there is need of special proofs to
   evince that each of the books now included in that sacred volume, has a
   right to the place which it occupies; or does in reality contain a part
   of that revelation which God has given.

   If, therefore, it could be shown (which however it never can) that some
   particular book, now included in the Bible, is not authentic, the
   conclusion thence derived would only affect that single production;
   unless it were recognized as divine by the writers of the other books.
   The credit of the whole volume would not be destroyed, even if it could
   be proved that one half the books of which it consists are spurious.
   Infidels have much more to effect in overthrowing the Bible than they
   commonly suppose. It is incumbent on them to demonstrate, not only that
   this or that book is false, but that every one of these productions is
   destitute of evidence, that it has been derived from the inspiration of
   God.

   On the other hand, it is manifest that the advocate of divine
   revelation is bound to defend the claims of every separate portion of
   this volume; or to reject from it that part which has no evidence of a
   divine origin. It is necessary that he should be able to render a good
   reason why he admits any particular book, to form a part of the
   inspired volume.

   It is true that the antiquity of this collection claims for it a high
   degree of respect. The transmission of this volume to us, through so
   many centuries, as Holy Scripture, should teach us to be cautious how
   we question what is so venerable for its antiquity. But this only
   furnishes one presumptive argument in favour of each book. It by no
   means renders all further investigation unnecessary; much less,
   impious.

   It is easy to conceive that books not written by the inspiration of
   God, might, by some casualty or mistake, find a place in the sacred
   volume. In fact, we have a striking example of this very thing, in the
   Greek and Latin Bibles which are now in use, and held to be sacred by a
   large majority of those who are denominated Christians. These Bibles,
   besides the books which have evidence of being truly inspired, contain
   a number of other books, the claim of which to inspiration cannot be
   sustained by solid and satisfactory reasons. This inquiry, therefore,
   is far from being one of mere curiosity: it is in the highest degree
   practical, and concerns the conscience of every man capable of making
   the investigation. We agree, in the general, that the Bible is the word
   of God, and an authoritative rule; but the momentous question
   immediately presents itself, What belongs to the Bible? Of what books
   does this sacred volume consist? And it will not answer, to resolve to
   take it as it has come down to us, without further inquiry; for the
   Bible has come down to us, in several different forms. The Vulgate
   Latin Bible, which alone was in use for hundreds of years before the
   era of the Reformation, and also the Greek version of the Old
   Testament, contain many books not in the copies of the Hebrew
   Scriptures. Now, to determine which of these contains the whole of the
   inspired books given to the Jews before the advent of Christ and no
   more, requires research and accurate examination. The inquiry,
   therefore, is not optional, but forces itself upon every conscientious
   man; for as no one is at liberty to reject from the sacred volume one
   sentence, much less a whole book, of the revelation of God, so no one
   has a right to add anything to the word of God; and of consequence, no
   one may receive as divine what others have, without authority, added to
   the Holy Scriptures. Every man, therefore, according to his opportunity
   and capacity, is under a moral obligation to use his best endeavours to
   ascertain what books do, really, and of right, belong to the Bible. An
   error here, on either side, is dangerous; for, on the one hand, if we
   reject a part of divine revelation, we dishonour God, and deprive
   ourselves of the benefit which might be derived from that portion of
   divine truth; and on the other hand, we are guilty of an equal offence,
   and may suffer an equal injury, by adding spurious productions to the
   Holy Scriptures; for thus we adulterate and poison the fountain of
   life, and subject our consciences to the authority of mere men.

   I think, therefore, that the importance and necessity of this inquiry
   must be evident to every person of serious reflection. But to some it
   may appear that this matter has been long ago settled on the firmest
   principles; and that it can answer no good purpose to agitate
   questions, which have a tendency to produce doubts and misgivings in
   the minds of common Christians, rather than a confirmation of their
   faith. In reply to the first part of this objection, I would say, that
   it is freely admitted that this subject has been ably and fully
   discussed long ago, and in almost every age until the present time; and
   the author aims at nothing more, in this short treatise, than to
   exhibit to the sincere inquirer, who may not enjoy better means of
   information, the subject of those discussions and proofs, which ought
   to be in the possession of every Christian. His object is not to bring
   forth anything new, but to collect and condense in a narrow space, what
   has been written by the judicious and the learned, on this important
   subject. But, that discussion tends to induce doubting is a sentiment
   unworthy of Christians, who maintain that their religion is founded on
   the best reasons, and who are commanded "to give to every man a reason
   of the hope that is in them." That faith which is weakened by
   discussion is mere prejudice, not true faith. They who receive the most
   important articles of their religion upon trust from human authority,
   are continually liable to be thrown into doubt; and the only method of
   obviating this evil is to dig deep and lay our foundation upon a rock.
   If this objection had any weight, it would discourage all attempts to
   establish the truth of our holy religion by argument; and would also
   damp the spirit of free inquiry on every important subject. It is true,
   however, that the first effect of free discussion may be to shake that
   easy confidence which most men entertain, that all their opinions are
   correct: but the beneficial result will be, that instead of a
   persuasion, having no other foundation than prejudice, it will generate
   a faith resting on the firm basis of evidence.

   There is, undoubtedly, among Christians, too great a disposition to
   acquiesce, without examination, in the religion of their forefathers.
   There is too great an aversion to that kind of research, which requires
   time and labour; so that many who are fully competent to examine the
   foundation on which their religion rests, never take the pains to enter
   on the investigation; and it is to be regretted, that many who are much
   occupied with speculations on abstruse points of theology, waste the
   energies of their minds on subjects which can yield them no manner of
   profit, while they neglect entirely, or but superficially attend to,
   points of fundamental importance.

   The two great questions most deserving the attention of all men, are:
   first, whether the Bible and all that it contains is from God:
   secondly, what are those truths which the Bible was intended to teach
   us. These two grand inquiries are sufficient to give occupation and
   vigorous exercise to intellectual faculties of the highest order; and
   they are not removed entirely out of the reach of plain uneducated
   Christians. From the fountain of divine truth every one may draw
   according to his capacity. But these inquiries are neglected, not so
   much for want of time and capacity, as because we take no pleasure in
   searching for and contemplating divine truth. Just in proportion as men
   love the truth and value the Bible, they will take an interest in all
   inquiries which relate to the authenticity, canonical authority, and
   correct interpretation of the sacred books. The time will come, I doubt
   not, when these studies will occupy the minds of thousands, where they
   now engage the attention of one. The Bible will grow into importance in
   the estimation of men, just in the same proportion as true religion
   flourishes. It will not only be the fashion to associate for printing
   and circulating the Holy Scriptures; but it will become customary for
   men of the highest literary attainments, as well as others, to study
   the sacred pages with unceasing assiduity and prayer. And, in
   proportion as the Bible is understood in its simplicity and momentous
   import, the mere doctrines of men will disappear; and the dogmas of the
   schools and the alliance with philosophy being renounced, there will be
   among sincere inquirers after truth, an increasing tendency to unity of
   sentiment, as well as unity of spirit. The pride of learning and of
   intellect being sacrificed, and all distinctions counted but loss for
   the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, a thousand knotty questions,
   which now cause divisions and gender strifes, will be forgotten; and
   the wonder of our more enlightened posterity will be, how good men
   could have wasted their time and their talents in such unprofitable
   speculations; and, more especially, how they could have permitted
   themselves to engage in fierce and unbrotherly contentions about
   matters of little importance.

   Then also men will no more neglect and undervalue the Scriptures, on
   pretence of possessing a brighter light within them, than that which
   emanates from the divine word. That spurious devotion which affects a
   superiority to external means and ordinances, will be exchanged for a
   simple, sincere reliance on the revealed will of God; and those
   assemblies from which the sacred volume is now excluded, while the
   effusions of every heated imagination are deemed revelations of the
   Spirit, will become, under the influence of divine truth, churches of
   the living God.

   In those future days of the prosperity of Zion, the service of the most
   high God will be considered by men, generally, as the noblest
   employment; and the best talents and attainments will be consecrated on
   the altar of God; and the enterprises, and the labours which they now
   undertake to gratify an avaricious, ambitious, or voluptuous
   disposition, will be pursued from love to God and man. The merchant
   will plan, and travel, and traffic, to obtain the means of propagating
   the gospel in foreign parts, and promoting Christian knowledge at home;
   yea, the common labourer will cheerfully endure toil and privation,
   that he may have a mite to cast into the treasury of the Lord.

   Now, many consider all that is given to circulate the Bible, and to
   send missionaries and tracts for the instruction of the ignorant, as so
   much wasted; but then, all expenditures will be considered as profuse
   and wasteful, which terminate in mere selfish gratification; and those
   funds will alone be reckoned useful, which are applied to promote the
   glory of God and the welfare of men.

   These, however, may appear to many as the visions of a heated
   imagination, which will never be realized; but if the same change in
   the views and sentiments of men which has been going on for thirty
   years past, shall continue to advance with the same steady pace, half a
   century will not have elapsed from the present time, before such a
   scene will be exhibited to the admiring eyes of believers, as will
   fully justify the foregoing anticipations.

   But I have wandered wide of my subject--I will now recall the attention
   of the reader to the consideration of the exceeding great importance of
   ascertaining the true Canon of Holy Scripture. This investigation may,
   indeed, appear dry and unentertaining, but every thing which bears any
   relation to the great Charter of our privileges and our hopes, ought to
   be interesting to us. It has been my object, to bring this subject not
   only more conveniently within the reach of the theological student, but
   also to a level with the capacity of the common Christian. That this
   work may in some humble degree subserve the cause of the Bible, is the
   sincere prayer of

   THE AUTHOR.

SECTION I.

  EARLY USE AND IMPORT OF THE WORD CANON.

   THE word Canon properly signifies a rule: and it is used in this sense
   several times in the New Testament, as Gal. vi. 16; "As many as walk
   according to this rule." Phil. iii. 16; "Let us walk by the same rule."
   [1] But in these passages there is no reference to the Scriptures as a
   volume.

   The word Canon, however, was early used by the Christian Fathers to
   designate the inspired Scriptures. Irenæus, speaking of the Scriptures,
   calls them "the Canon of truth." Clement of Alexandria, referring to a
   quotation of the gospel according to the Egyptians, says, "But they
   follow anything, rather than the true canonical gospels." [2]

   Eusebius says of Origen, "But in the first book of his commentaries on
   the gospel of Matthew, observing the ecclesiastical Canon, he declares
   that he knew of four gospels only."

   Athanasius, in his Festal Epistle, speaks of three sorts of books; the
   canonical--such as were allowed to be read--and such as were
   Apocryphal. By the first he evidently means such as we now call
   canonical.

   The Council of Laodicea ordained, "that none but canonical books should
   be read in the church; that is, the books of the Old and New
   Testaments."

   Rufin, after enumerating the books of the Old and New Testaments, goes
   on to mention three classes of books. 1. Such as were included in the
   Canon. 2. Ecclesiastical, or such as were allowed to be read. 3.
   Apocryphal, such as were not permitted to be publicly read. [3]

   Jerome often speaks of the Canon of Scripture, and mentions books which
   might be read, but did not belong to the Canon. [4]

   The third Council of Carthage ordained, "That nothing beside the
   canonical Scriptures be read in the church, under the name of the
   divine Scriptures."

   Augustine often makes mention of the canonical Scriptures, and the
   whole Canon of Scripture, meaning to designate all the sacred books of
   the Old and New Testaments. "We read of some," says he, "that they
   searched the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so. What
   Scriptures, I pray, except the canonical Scriptures of the Law and the
   Prophets? To them have been since added, the Gospels, the Epistles of
   the Apostles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Revelation of John."
   [5]

   Chrysostom says, "They fall into great absurdities, who will not follow
   the Canon of the divine Scripture, but trust to their own reasoning."

   Isidore of Pelusium observes, "That these things are so, we shall
   perceive, if we attend to the Canon of truth--the divine Scriptures."

   And Leontius of Constantinople, having cited the whole catalogue of the
   books of sacred Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation, concludes,
   "These are the ancient and the new books, which are received in the
   church as canonical."

   Eusebius informs us that Origen, in his Exposition on Matthew,
   "enumerates the books of Scripture according to the Canon of the
   Church." [6]

   Epiphanius, speaking of certain heretics, says, "They received the
   apocryphal Acts of Andrew and Thomas, rejecting the Canon received by
   the Church." [7]

   Philastrius speaks of the distinction of Canonical and Apocryphal as
   well known in his time. [8]

   From the authorities cited above, it will evidently appear, that at an
   early period the sacred Scriptures were carefully distinguished from
   all other writings, and formed a rule, which all Christians considered
   to be authoritative: and that this collection of sacred writings
   received the name of Canon. [9]

   The division of the sacred books which is most ancient and universal,
   is, into the Old Testament, and the New Testament. The apostle Paul
   himself lays a foundation for this distinction; for, in his second
   epistle to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. iii. 14, he uses the phrases Old
   Testament and New Testament; and in one instance, designates the
   Scriptures of the Law, by the former title: "For until this day," says
   he, "remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old
   Testament."

   It is our object, in this work, to inquire into the Canon, both of the
   Old and New Testament, and to discuss all the principal questions
   connected with this subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] The word Kanon literally signifies a reed, by which the dimensions
   of anything were measured; and hence it came figuratively to signify a
   rule. The word was used by the Greek grammarians to designate those
   authors who were considered as authority in matters of criticism: Vid.
   Wordsworth on the Canon, p. 5.

   [2] Strom. Lib. iii. p. 453.

   [3] Expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum, p. 26. After giving a catalogue
   both of the books of the Old and New Testaments, he says, "Hæc sunt quæ
   patres inter Canonem concluserunt."

   [4] Prolog. Gal. in multis locis.

   [5] De Doctrina Christiana, vol. iii. Lib. ii. pt. 1, p. 47. Ed. Paris.
   Epist. ad Hieron, 19. Ad Paulinum, 112.

   [6] Eus. Hist. Lib. VI. c. 25.

   [7] Hæres. 61.

   [8] De Hæresibus, 40.

   [9] It cannot be denied, however, that the word Canon is not always
   used by the Fathers in the same definite sense. Sometimes, under this
   name, they include books not inspired, and this has given some
   plausibility to the Popish doctrine respecting the Apocrypha.

SECTION II.

   CONSTITUTION OF THE CANON OF THE OLD TESTAMENT BY EZRA--THE CANON OF
   THE OLD TESTAMENT, AS IT NOW EXISTS, SANCTIONED BY CHRIST AND HIS
   APOSTLES--CATALOGUES OF THE BOOKS BY SOME OF THE EARLY
   FATHERS--AGREEMENT OF JEWS AND CHRISTIANS ON THIS SUBJECT.

   The five books of Moses were, when finished, carefully deposited by the
   side of the ark of the Covenant, Deut. xxxi. 24-26. "And it came to
   pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a
   book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites which
   bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this book of the
   law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your
   God, that it may be there for a witness against thee."

   No doubt, copies of the sacred volume were made out, before it was
   deposited in the most holy place; for as it was there inaccessible to
   any but the priests, the people generally must have remained ignorant,
   had there been no copies of the law. But we know that copies were
   written, for it was one of the laws respecting the duty of a king, when
   such an officer should be appointed, that he should write out a copy of
   the law with his own hand. Deut. xvii. 18-20, "And it shall be when he
   sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy
   of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests, the
   Levites. And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein, all the
   days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep
   all the words of this law and these statutes to do them; that his heart
   be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from
   the commandment to the right hand or to the left: to the end that he
   may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children in the midst
   of Israel." It is related by Josephus, that by the direction of Moses,
   a copy of the law was prepared for each of the tribes of Israel.

   It seems that the book of Joshua was annexed to the volume of the
   Pentateuch; for we read that "Joshua wrote these words in the book of
   the law of God." See Josh i. 8; xxiv. 26. And the matters contained in
   this book were of public concern to the nation, as well as those
   recorded in the law. For, as in the latter were written statutes and
   ordinances, to direct them in all matters sacred and civil; so in the
   former was recorded the division of the land among the tribes. The
   possession of each tribe was here accurately defined, so that this book
   served as a national deed of conveyance. When other books were added to
   the Canon, no doubt, the inspired men who were moved by the Holy Spirit
   to write them, would be careful to deposit copies in the sanctuary, and
   to have other copies put into circulation. But on this subject we have
   no precise information. We know not with what degree of care the sacred
   books were guarded, or to what extent copies were multiplied.

   A single fact shows that the sacred autograph of Moses had well nigh
   perished, in the idolatrous reigns of Manasseh and Amon, but was found,
   during the reign of the pious Josiah, among the rubbish of the temple.
   It cannot, however, be reasonably supposed, that there were no other
   copies of the law scattered through the nation. It does indeed seem
   that the young king had never seen the book, and was ignorant of its
   contents, until it was now read to him; but while the autograph of
   Moses had been misplaced, and buried among the ruins, many pious men
   might have possessed private copies.

   And although at the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple by
   Nebuchadnezzar, this precious volume was, in all probability, destroyed
   with the ark and all the holy apparatus of the sanctuary; yet we are
   not to credit the Jewish tradition, too readily received by the
   Christian Fathers, that, on this occasion, all the copies of the
   Scriptures were lost, and that Ezra restored the whole by a miracle.
   This is a mere Jewish fable, depending on no higher authority than a
   passage in the fourth book of Esdras, and is utterly inconsistent with
   facts recorded in the sacred volume. We know that Daniel had a copy of
   the Scriptures, for he quotes them, and makes express mention of the
   prophecies of Jeremiah. And Ezra is called "a ready scribe in the law;"
   and it is said, in the sixth chapter of Ezra, that when the temple was
   finished, the functions of the priests and Levites were regulated, "as
   it is written in the book of Moses." And this was many years before
   Ezra came to Jerusalem. And in the eighth chapter of Nehemiah, it is
   said that Ezra, at the request of the people, "brought the law before
   the congregation, and he read therein from the morning until mid-day.
   And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people." It is
   evident, therefore, that all the copies of the Scriptures were not lost
   during the captivity. This story, no doubt, originated from two facts:
   the first, that the autographs in the temple, had been destroyed with
   that sacred edifice; and the second, that Ezra took great pains to have
   correct copies of the Scriptures prepared and circulated.

   It seems to be agreed by all, that the forming of the present Canon of
   the Old Testament should be attributed to Ezra. To assist him in this
   work, the Jewish writers inform us, that there existed in his time a
   great synagogue, consisting of one hundred and twenty men, including
   Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; the
   prophets Haggai and Zechariah; and also Simon the Just. But it is very
   absurd to suppose that all these lived at one time, and formed one
   synagogue, as they are pleased to represent it: for, from the time of
   Daniel to that of Simon the Just, no less than two hundred and fifty
   years intervened.

   It is, however, not improbable that Ezra was assisted in this great
   work, by many learned and pious men, who were cotemporary with him; and
   as prophets had always been the superintendents, as well as writers of
   the sacred volume, it is likely that the inspired men who lived at the
   same time as Ezra, would give attention to this work. But in regard to
   this great synagogue, the only thing probable is, that the men who are
   said to have belonged to it, did not live in one age, but successively,
   until the time of Simon the Just, who was made high priest about
   twenty-five years after the death of Alexander the Great. This opinion
   has its probability increased, by the consideration that the Canon of
   the Old Testament appears not to have been fully completed, until about
   the time of Simon the Just. Malachi seems to have lived after the time
   of Ezra, and therefore his prophecy could not have been added to the
   Canon by this eminent scribe; unless we adopt the opinion of the Jews,
   who will have Malachi to be no other than Ezra himself; maintaining,
   that while Ezra was his proper name, he received that of Malachi, from
   the circumstance of his having been sent to superintend the religious
   concerns of the Jews; for the import of that name is, a messenger, or
   one sent.

   But this is not all--in the book of Nehemiah, [10] mention is made of
   the high priest Jaddua, and of Darius Codomannus, king of Persia, both
   of whom lived at least a hundred years after the time of Ezra. In the
   third chapter of the first book of Chronicles, the genealogy of the
   sons of Zerubbabel is carried down, at least to the time of Alexander
   the Great. This book, therefore, could not have been put into the Canon
   by Ezra; nor much earlier than the time of Simon the Just. The book of
   Esther, also, was probably added during this interval.

   The probable conclusion, therefore, is that Ezra began this work, and
   collected and arranged all the sacred books which belonged to the Canon
   before his time, and that a succession of pious and learned men
   continued to pay attention to the Canon, until the whole was completed,
   about the time of Simon the Just. After which, nothing was added to the
   Canon of the Old Testament.

   Most, however, are of opinion that nothing was added after the book of
   Malachi was written, except a few names and notes; and that all the
   books belonging to the Canon of the Old Testament, were collected and
   inserted in the sacred volume by Ezra himself. And this opinion seems
   to be the safest, and is not incredible in itself. It accords also with
   the uniform tradition of the Jews, that Ezra completed the Canon of the
   Old Testament; and that after Malachi there arose no prophet who added
   anything to the sacred volume. [11]

   Whether the books were now collected into a single volume, or were
   bound up in several codices, is a question of no importance. If we can
   ascertain what books were received as canonical, it matters not in what
   form they were preserved. It seems probable, however, that the sacred
   books were at this time distributed into three volumes, the Law; the
   Prophets, and the Hagiographa. This division, we know to be as ancient
   as the time of our Saviour, for he says, "These are the words which I
   spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be
   fulfilled which are written in the law, and in the prophets, and in the
   psalms, concerning me." Luke xxiv. 44. Josephus also makes mention of
   this division, and it is by the Jews, with one consent, referred to
   Ezra, as its author.

   In establishing the Canon of the Old Testament, we might labour under
   considerable uncertainty and embarrassment, in regard to several books
   were it not that the whole of what were called "the Scriptures," and
   which were included in the threefold division mentioned above, received
   the explicit sanction of our Lord. He was not backward to reprove the
   Jews for disobeying, misinterpreting, and adding their traditions to
   the Scriptures, but he never drops a hint that they had been unfaithful
   or careless in the preservation of the sacred books. This argument for
   the integrity of the books of the Old Testament was used by Origen, as
   we are informed by Jerome, who says: "Si aliquis dixerit Hebræos
   libros, a Judæis esse falsatos, audiat Origenem: Quod nunquam Dominus
   et Apostoli, qui cætera crimina in Scribis, de hoc crimine quod est
   maximum, reticuissent." In Esai. cvi, tom. iii. p. 63. So far from
   this, he refers to the Scriptures as an infallible rule, which "must be
   fulfilled," Mark xiv. 49, and "could not be broken." John x. 35.
   "Search the Scriptures," John v. 39, said he, "for in them ye think ye
   have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me." The errors
   of the Sadducees are attributed to an ignorance of the Scriptures: and
   they are never mentioned but with the highest respect, and as the
   unerring word of God. The apostle Paul, also, referring principally, if
   not wholly, to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, says, "And that
   from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to
   make thee wise unto salvation. All Scripture is given by inspiration of
   God." 2 Tim. iii. 15, 16. They are also called by this apostle, "the
   oracles of God;" "the lively oracles," "the word of God;" and when
   quotations are made from David, it is represented as "the Holy Ghost
   speaking by the mouth of David." Acts i. 16; iv. 25. The testimony of
   Peter is not less explicit, for he says, "The prophecy came not in old
   time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved
   by the Holy Ghost." 2 Pet. i. 21. And the apostle James speaks of the
   Scriptures with equal confidence and respect: "And receive with
   meekness," says he, "the ingrafted word which is able to save your
   souls." James i. 21-23. "And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith,"
   &c. "Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain?" James iv. 5, &c.

   We have, therefore, an important point established with the utmost
   certainty, that the volume of Scripture which existed in the time of
   Christ and his apostles was uncorrupted, and was esteemed by them an
   infallible rule. Now, if we can ascertain what books were then included
   in the Sacred Volume, we shall be able to settle the Canon of the Old
   Testament without uncertainty.

   But here lies the difficulty. Neither Christ nor any of his apostles
   has given us a catalogue of the books which composed the Scriptures of
   the Old Testament. They have distinctly quoted a number of these books,
   and, so far, the evidence is complete. We know that the law, and the
   Prophets, and the Psalms were included in their Canon. But this does
   not ascertain, particularly, whether the very same books which we now
   find in the Old Testament were then found in it and no others. It is
   necessary then, to resort to other sources of information. And,
   happily, the Jewish historian Josephus furnishes us with the very
   information which we want; not, indeed, as explicitly as we could wish,
   but sufficiently so to lead us to a very satisfactory conclusion. He
   does not name the books of the Old Testament, but he numbers them, and
   so describes them that there is scarcely room for any mistake. The
   important passage to which we refer is in his first book against Apion.
   "We have," says he, "only two-and-twenty books, which are justly
   believed to be of divine authority--of which five are the books of
   Moses. From the death of Moses to the reign of Artaxerxes, the son of
   Xerxes, king of Persia, the Prophets, who were the successors of Moses,
   have written in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns
   to God, and precepts for the regulation of human life." Now, the five
   books of Moses are universally agreed to be Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
   Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The thirteen books written by the prophets
   will include Joshua, Judges, with Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah
   with Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, the twelve minor Prophets, Job,
   Ezra, Esther, and Chronicles. The four remaining books will be, Psalms,
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon, which make the whole
   number twenty-two. The Canon then existing is proved to be the same as
   that which we now possess. It would appear, indeed, that these books
   might more conveniently be reckoned twenty-four; and this is the
   present method of numbering them by the modern Jews; but formerly the
   number was regulated by that of the Hebrew alphabet, which consists of
   twenty-two letters: therefore they annexed the small book of Ruth to
   Judges; and probably it is a continuation of this book by the same
   author. They added, also, the Lamentations of Jeremiah to his prophecy,
   and this was natural enough. As to the minor prophets, which form
   twelve separate books in our Bibles, they were, anciently, always
   reckoned one book, so they are considered in every ancient catalogue,
   and in all quotations from them. Josephus adds, to what is cited above,
   the following: "But as to the books which have been written since the
   time of Artaxerxes until our times, they are not considered worthy of
   the same credit as the former, because they do not contain accurate
   doctrine sanctioned by the prophets." [12]

   It will not be supposed that any change could have occurred in the
   Canon from the time of our Saviour and his apostles, to that in which
   Josephus wrote. Indeed, he may be considered the contemporary of the
   apostles, as he was born about the time of Paul's conversion to
   Christianity, and was therefore grown up to man's age long before the
   death of this apostle; and the apostle John probably survived him. And
   it must be remembered that Josephus is here giving his testimony to a
   public fact: he is declaring what books were received as divine by his
   nation; and he does it without hesitation or inconsistency. "We have,"
   says he, "only twenty-two books which are justly believed to be of
   divine authority."

   We are able also to adduce other testimony to prove the same thing.
   Some of the early Christian Fathers, who had been brought up in
   Paganism, when they embraced Christianity, were curious in their
   inquiries into the Canon of the Old Testament; and the result of the
   researches of some of them still remains. Melito, bishop of Sardis,
   travelled into Judea, for the very purpose of satisfying himself, on
   this point. And although his own writings are lost, Eusebius has
   preserved his catalogue of the books of the Old Testament; from which
   it appears, that the very same books were, in his day, received into
   the Canon, as are now found in our Hebrew Bibles. In the catalogue of
   Melito, presented by Eusebius, after Proverbs, the word Wisdom occurs,
   which nearly all commentators have been of opinion is only another name
   for the same book, and not the name of the book now called "The Wisdom
   of Solomon." There is, however, an omission of Esther and Nehemiah. As
   to the latter, it creates no difficulty, for Ezra and Nehemiah are
   commonly counted as one book; and some learned men are of opinion that
   Ezra being the author of Esther, this book also is included under the
   name Esdras. The interval between Melito and Josephus is not a hundred
   years, so that no alteration in the Canon can be reasonably supposed to
   have taken place in this period.

   Very soon after Melito, Origen furnishes us with a catalogue of the
   books of the Old Testament, which perfectly accords with our Canon,
   except that he omits the Minor Prophets; which omission must have been
   a mere slip of the pen, in him or his copyist, as it is certain that he
   received this as a book of Holy Scripture: and the number of the books
   of the Old Testament, given by him in this very place, cannot be
   completed without reckoning the twelve Minor Prophets as one.

   After Origen, we have catalogues in succession, not only by men of the
   first authority in the church, but by councils, consisting of numerous
   bishops, all which are perfectly the same as our own. It will be
   sufficient merely to refer to these sources of information. Catalogues
   of the books of the Old Testament have been given by Athanasius; by
   Cyril; by Augustine; by Jerome; by Rufin; by the council of Laodicea,
   in their LX. Canon; and by the council of Carthage. And when it is
   considered, that all these catalogues exactly correspond with our
   present Canon of the. Hebrew Bible, the evidence, I think, must appear
   complete to every impartial mind, that the Canon of the Old Testament
   is settled upon the clearest historical grounds. There seems to be
   nothing to be wished for further in the confirmation of this point.

   But if all this testimony had been wanting, there is still a source of
   evidence to which we might refer with the utmost confidence, as
   perfectly conclusive on this point; I mean the fact that these books
   have been ever since the time of Christ and his apostles in the keeping
   of both Jews and Christians, who have been constantly arrayed in
   opposition to each other; so that it was impossible that any change
   should have been made in the Canon, by either party, without being
   immediately detected by the other. And the conclusive evidence that no
   alteration in the Canon has occurred is the perfect agreement of these
   hostile parties in regard to the books of the Old Testament at this
   time. On this point, the Jew and Christian are harmonious. There is no
   complaint of addition to, or diminution of, the sacred books on either
   side. The Hebrew Bible of the Jew is the Bible of the Christian There
   is here no difference. A learned Jew and a Christian have even been
   united in publishing an excellent edition of the Hebrew Bible. [13]
   Now, if any alteration in the Canon has occurred, it must have been by
   the concert or collusion of both parties; but how absurd this idea is
   must be manifest to all.

   I acknowledge what is here said of the agreement of Christians and Jews
   can only be said in relation to Protestant Christians. For as to those
   of the Romish and Greek communions they have admitted other books into
   the Canon, which Jews and Protestants hold to be apocryphal; but these
   books will form the subject of a particular discussion, in the sequel
   of this work.

   The fact is important, that a short time after the Canon of the Old
   Testament was closed, a translation was made of the whole of the books
   into the Greek language. This translation was made at Alexandria, in
   Egypt, at the request, it is said, of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of
   Egypt, that he might have a copy of these sacred books in the famous
   library which he was engaged in collecting. It is called the
   Septuagint, from its being made, according to the accounts which have
   been handed down, by seventy, or rather seventy-two men; six from each
   of the tribes of Israel. So many fabulous things have been reported
   concerning this version, that it is very difficult to ascertain the
   precise truth. But it is manifest from internal evidence, that it was
   not the work of one hand, nor probably of one set of translators: for,
   while some books are rendered with great accuracy, and in a very
   literal manner, others are translated with little care, and the meaning
   of the original is very imperfectly given. The probability is that the
   Pentateuch was first translated, and the other books were added from
   time to time by different hands; but when the work was once begun, it
   is not likely that it would be long before the whole was completed. Now
   this Greek version contains all the books which are found in our common
   Hebrew Bibles. It is a good witness therefore to prove that all these
   books were in the Canon when this version was made. The apocryphal
   books, which have long been connected with this version, will furnish a
   subject for consideration hereafter.

   There is, moreover, a distinct and remarkable testimony to the
   antiquity of the five books of Moses in the Samaritan Pentateuch, which
   has existed in a form entirely separate from the Jewish copies, and in
   a character totally different from that in which the Hebrew Bible has
   been for many ages written. It has also been preserved and handed down
   to us by a people who have ever been hostile to the Jews. This
   Pentateuch has, without doubt, been transmitted through a separate
   channel ever since the ten tribes of Israel were carried captive. It
   furnishes authentic testimony to the great antiquity of the books of
   Moses, and shows how little they have been corrupted during the lapse
   of nearly three thousand years. The Samaritans were the people
   transplanted from other countries into the places vacated by the
   captivity of the ten tribes of Israel. At first, they were all
   idolaters; but being annoyed by wild beasts, they supposed it was
   because they knew not how to worship the God of the country. They,
   therefore, requested that a priest should be sent to them of the
   Israelitish nation to instruct them. Their request was granted; and
   this priest, no doubt, brought with him a copy of the law. At one time
   it was doubted whether a Samaritan Pentateuch was in existence, but a
   learned man going into Palestine, obtained several copies. And they
   have also a translation of the whole into the Samaritan language. The
   Pentateuch, though Hebrew, is written in Samaritan characters, which
   many learned men think was the original Hebrew character.

SECTION III.

   APOCRYPHAL BOOKS, THEIR ORIGIN--IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN
   CANONICAL AND APOCRYPHAL BOOKS--SIX BOOKS OF THIS CLASS PRONOUNCED
   CANONICAL BY THE COUNCIL OF TRENT--NOT IN THE HEBREW, NOR RECEIVED BY
   THE JEWS, ANCIENT OR MODERN.

   THE word Apocrypha signifies concealed, obscure, without authority. In
   reference to the Bible, it is employed to designate such books as claim
   a place in the sacred volume, but which are not canonical. It is said
   to have been first used by Melito, bishop of Sardis.

   An inquiry into this subject cannot be uninteresting to the friends of
   the Bible; for it behoves them to ascertain, on the best evidence, what
   books belong to the sacred volume, and also, on what grounds other
   books are rejected from the Canon. This subject assumes a higher
   importance from the fact, that Christians are much divided on this
   point; for, some receive as of canonical authority, books which others
   reject as spurious, or consider merely as human compositions. On such a
   point every Christian should form his opinion upon the best information
   which he can obtain.

   In controversy with the Romanists this subject meets us at the very
   threshold. It is vain to dispute about particular doctrines of
   Scripture until it is determined what books are to be received as
   Scripture.

   This subject gave rise to a very unpleasant controversy between the
   British and Foreign Bible Society and some of the leading ministers of
   Scotland. The principle adopted at the beginning by the Bible Society
   was, to circulate nothing but the text of the Holy Scriptures, without
   note or comment. But in order to get the Scriptures into the hands of
   the Romanists, Bibles containing the Apocrypha were circulated, which
   proceeding gave just offence to the ministers of the Church of
   Scotland, and to the efficient auxiliaries of that country.

   A strong remonstrance was therefore made to the Managers of the British
   and Foreign Bible Society, and their answer not being entirely
   satisfactory, the Scotch ministers withdrew from the Society in London,
   and established one independent of the mother Society; and this breach
   has never been healed. But it is due to the British and Foreign Bible
   Society to state, that in consequence of the discussion, they adopted a
   correct principle for their future proceedings.

   The whole subject was referred to a select and learned sub-committee;
   who, after mature deliberation, brought in a report which was adopted,
   and led to the following wise resolution in the General Committee, viz.
   "That the funds of the Society be applied to the printing and
   circulation of the canonical books of Scripture to the exclusion of
   those books which are termed apocryphal; and that all copies printed,
   either entirely or in part, at the expense of the Society, and whether
   such copies consist of the whole or of any part of such books, be
   invariably issued bound, no other book whatever being bound with them;
   and further, that all money grants to societies or individuals be made
   only in conformity with the principle of this regulation."

   "In the sacred volume, as it is to be hereafter distributed by the
   Society, there is to be nothing but divine truth, nothing but what is
   acknowledged by all Christians to be such. Of course all may unite in
   the work of distribution, even should they regard the volume as
   containing but part of the inspired writings; just as they might in the
   circulation of the Pentateuch or the Book of Psalms, or the Prophets,
   or the New Testament. Such harmonious operation would not, however, be
   possible, if the books of the apocrypha were mingled or joined with the
   rest; and besides, those who have the strongest objection to the
   apocrypha, are, ordinarily, those who are most forward in active and
   liberal efforts to send the word of God to all people."

   This judicious decision of the Committee of the British and Foreign
   Bible Society depends for its correctness on the supposition that the
   books of the apocrypha are not canonical; for, whatever may be said
   about circulating a part of the Bible, it was undoubtedly the original
   object of this Society to print and circulate the whole of the sacred
   volume. Hence appears the practical importance of the inquiry which we
   have here instituted, to ascertain whether these books have any claim
   whatever to a place in the sacred Canon.

   At a very early period of the Christian church, great pains were taken
   to distinguish between such books as were inspired and canonical, and
   such as were written by uninspired men. It has never been doubted among
   Christians, that the canonical books only were of divine authority, and
   furnished an infallible rule of faith and practice; but it has not been
   agreed what books ought to be considered canonical and what apocryphal.
   In regard to those which have already been enumerated, as belonging to
   the Old Testament, there is a pretty general consent of Jews and
   Christians, of Romanists and Protestants; but in regard to some other
   books there is a wide difference of opinion.

   The council of Trent, in their fourth session, gave a catalogue of the
   books of the Old Testament, among which are included Tobit, Judith,
   Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, and two books of the Maccabees. [14]
   Besides, they include under the name Esther and Daniel, certain
   additional chapters, which are not found in the Hebrew copies. The book
   of Esther is made to consist of sixteen chapters; and prefixed to the
   book of Daniel, is the History of Susannah; the Song of the Three
   Children is inserted in the third chapter; and the History of Bel and
   the Dragon is added at the end of this book. Other books which are
   found in the Greek or Latin Bibles, they rejected as apocryphal; as the
   third and fourth books of Esdras; [15] the third book of Maccabees; the
   cli. Psalm; the Appendix to Job; and the Preface to Lamentations.

   Both these classes of books, all denominations of Protestants consider
   apocryphal; but as the English church, in her Liturgy, directs that
   certain lessons shall be read from the former, for the instruction of
   the people, but not for confirmation of doctrine, they are retained in
   the larger copies of the English Bible, but are not mingled with the
   canonical books, as in the Vulgate, but placed at the end of the Old
   Testament, under the title of Apocrypha. It is certainly to be
   regretted that these books are permitted to be included in the same
   volume which contains the lively oracles,--the word of God,--the Holy
   Scriptures; all of which were given by inspiration; and more to be
   regretted still, that they should be read in the church promiscuously
   with the lessons taken from the canonical books; especially as no
   notice is given to the people, that what is read from these books is
   apocryphal; and as in the Prayer Book of the Episcopal church the
   tables which refer to the lessons to be read, have this title
   prefixed--"Tables of lessons of Holy Scripture to be read at Morning
   and Evening Prayer, throughout the year." The Rev. Doctor Wordsworth,
   in his work on the Canon, defends the practice of retaining in the
   Bible, and publicly reading in the church, certain lessons from the
   apocryphal books, principally because this was done by the ancient
   church; and he apologizes for the practice by saying, that these
   lessons are never read on the Lord's day. But as he acknowledges that
   they are not inspired, and are not canonical, the inference is plain,
   that they ought not to be included in the same volume with canonical
   books, and ought not to be read as Scripture in the churches. Now,
   however good and instructive these apocryphal lessons may be, it never
   can be justified, that they should thus be put on a level with the word
   of God. [16]

   But it is our object at present to show, that none of these books,
   canonized by the Council of Trent, and inserted in our larger English
   Bibles, are canonical.

   1. The first argument by which it may be proved that these books do not
   belong to the Canon of the Old Testament, is, that they are not found
   in the Hebrew Bible. They are not written in the Hebrew language, but
   in the Greek, which was not known to the Jews, until long after
   inspiration had ceased, and the Canon of the Old Testament was closed.
   It is rendered probable, indeed, that some of them were written
   originally in the Chaldaic. Jerome testifies this to be the fact, in
   regard to 1 Maccabees and Ecclesiasticus; and he says, that he
   translated the book of Tobit out of Chaldee into Latin; but this book
   is now found in the Greek, and there is good reason for believing that
   it was written originally in this language. It is certain, however,
   that none of these books were composed in the pure Hebrew of the Old
   Testament.

   Hottinger, indeed, informs us, that he had seen the whole of the
   apocrypha in pure Hebrew, among the Jews; but he entertains no doubt
   that it was translated into that language, in modern times: just as the
   whole New Testament has recently been translated into pure Hebrew.

   It is the common opinion of the Jews, and of the Christian Fathers,
   that Malachi was the last of the Old Testament prophets. Books written
   by uncertain authors afterwards, have no claim to be reckoned
   canonical, and there is good reason for believing that those books were
   written long after the time of Ezra and Malachi, and some of them
   perhaps later than the commencement of the Christian era.

   2. These books, though probably written by Jews, have never been
   received into the Canon by that people. In this, the ancient and modern
   Jews are of the same mind. Josephus declares, "That no more than
   twenty-two books were received as inspired by his nation." Philo, who
   refers often to the Old Testament in his writings, never makes the
   least mention of them; nor are they recognized in the Talmud as
   canonical. Not only so, but the Jewish Rabbies expressly reject them.

   Rabbi Azariah, speaking of these books, says, "They are received by
   Christians, not by us."

   R. Gedaliah, after giving a catalogue of the books of the Old
   Testament, with some account of their authors, adds these words, "It is
   worth while to know, that the nations of the world wrote many other
   books, which are included in their systems of sacred books, but not in
   our hands." To which he adds, "They say that some of these are found in
   the Chaldee, some in the Arabic, and some in the Greek language."

   R. Azariah ascribed the book called the Wisdom of Solomon to Philo; and
   R. Gedaliah, in speaking of the same book, says, "That if Solomon ever
   wrote it, it must have been in the Syriac language, to send it to some
   of the kings in the remotest parts of the East. "But," says he, "Ezra
   put his hand only to those books which were published by the prophets,
   under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and written in the sacred
   language; and our wise men prudently and deliberately resolved to
   sanction none, but such as were established and confirmed by him."

   "This book," says he, "the Gentiles (i. e. Christians) have added to
   their Bible." "Their wise men," says Buxtorf, "pronounced this book to
   be apocryphal."

   The book called Ecclesiasticus, said to be written by the son of
   Sirach, is expressly numbered among apocryphal books in the Talmud. "In
   the book of the Son of Sirach, it is forbidden to be read."

   Manasseh Ben Israel has this observation, "Those things which are
   alleged from a verse in Ecclesiasticus are nothing to the purpose,
   because that is an apocryphal book." Another of their writers says,
   "The book of the son of Sirach is added to our twenty-four sacred books
   by the Romans." This book also they call extraneous, which some of the
   Jews prohibit to be read. With what face then can the Romanists pretend
   that this book was added to the Canon not long before the time of
   Josephus?

   "Baruch," says one of their learned men, "is received by Christians,"
   (i. e. Romanists,) "but not by us."

   Of Tobit, it is said in Zemach David, "Know, then, that this book of
   Tobias is one of those which Christians join with the Hagiographa." A
   little afterwards, it is said, "Know then, that Tobit, which is among
   us in the Hebrew tongue, was translated from Latin into Hebrew by
   Sebastian Munster." The same writer affirms of the history of Susannah,
   "That it is received by Christians but not by us."

   The Jews, in the time of Jerome, entertained no other opinion of these
   books than those who came after them; for, in his preface to Daniel, he
   informs us, "That he had heard one of the Jewish doctors deriding the
   history of Susannah, saying, It was invented by some Greek, he knew not
   whom.'" [17]

   The same is the opinion of the Jews respecting the other books, which
   we call apocryphal, as is manifest from all the copies of the Hebrew
   Bible extant; for, undoubtedly if they believed that any of these books
   were canonical, they would give them a place in their sacred volume.
   But will any ask, what is the opinion of the Jews to us? I answer, much
   on this point. The oracles of God were committed to them; and they
   preserved them with a religious care until the advent of Messiah.
   Christ never censures them for adding to the sacred Scriptures, nor
   detracting from them. Since their nation has been in dispersion, copies
   of the Old Testament in Hebrew have been scattered all over the world,
   so that it was impossible to produce a universal alteration in the
   Canon. But it is needless to argue this point, for it is agreed by all
   that these books never were received by the Jewish nation.

   3. The third argument against the canonical authority of these books is
   derived from the total silence respecting them in the New Testament.
   They are never quoted by Christ and his apostles. This fact, however,
   is disputed by the Romanists, and they even attempt to establish their
   right to a place in the Canon from the citations which they pretend
   have been made from these books by the apostles. They refer to Rom. xi.
   and Heb. xi., where they allege that Paul has cited passages from the
   Book of Wisdom. "For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath
   been his counsellor?" "For before his translation he had this testimony
   that he pleased God." But both these passages are taken directly from
   the canonical books of the Old Testament. The first is nearly in the
   words of Isaiah; and the last from the book of Genesis; their other
   examples are as wide of the mark as these, and need not be set down.

   It has already been shown that these books were not included in the
   volume quoted and referred to by Christ and his apostles, under the
   title of the Scriptures, and and are entirely omitted by Josephus in
   his account of the sacred books. It would seem, therefore, that in the
   time of Christ, and for some time afterwards, they were utterly unknown
   or wholly disregarded.

   [15] The first and second books of Esdras are very frequently called
   the third and fourth; in which case the two canonical books, Ezra and
   Nehemiah, are reckoned the first and second: for both these books have
   been ascribed to Ezra as their author; but these are not included in
   the list of canonical books sanctioned by the Council of Trent, and
   therefore they do not come into controversy. Indeed, the second of
   these books is not found even in the Greek, but only in the Latin
   Vulgate, and is so replete with fables and false statements that it has
   never been esteemed of any value. They are both, however, retained in
   our larger English Bibles, and are honoured with the foremost place in
   the order of the apocryphal books.

SECTION IV.

   TESTIMONIES OF THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS, AND OF OTHER LEARNED MEN DOWN TO
   THE TIME OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, RESPECTING THE APOCRYPHA.

   THE fourth argument is, that these books were not received as canonical
   by the Christian Fathers, but were expressly declared to be apocryphal.

   Justin Martyr does not cite a single passage, in all his writings, from
   any apocryphal book.

   The first catalogue of the books of the Old Testament which we have,
   after the times of the apostles, from any Christian writer, is that of
   Melito, bishop of Sardis, before the end of the second century, which
   is preserved by Eusebius. The fragment is as follows: "Melito to his
   brother Onesimus, greeting. Since you have often earnestly requested of
   me, in consequence of your love of learning, a collection of the Sacred
   Scriptures of the Law and the Prophets, and what relates to the
   Saviour, and concerning our whole faith; and since, moreover, you wish
   to obtain an accurate knowledge of our ancient books, as it respects
   their number and order, I have used diligence to accomplish this,
   knowing your sincere affection towards the faith, and your earnest
   desire to become acquainted with the word; and that striving after
   eternal life, your love to God induces you to prefer these to all other
   things. Wherefore, going into the East, and to the very place where
   these things were published and transacted, and having made diligent
   search after the books of the Old Testament, I now subjoin and send you
   the following catalogue:--"Five books of Moses, viz., Genesis, Exodus,
   Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four books
   of Kings, two of Chronicles, the Psalms of David, the Proverbs of
   Solomon, or Wisdom, [18] Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, Job, Isaiah,
   Jeremiah, Twelve [prophets] in one book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Ezra." [19]

   Origen also says, "We should not be ignorant, that the canonical books
   are the same which the Hebrews delivered unto us, and are twenty-two in
   number, according to the number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet."
   Then he sets down, in order, the names of the books, in Greek and
   Hebrew. [20]

   Athanasius, in his Synopsis, says, "All the Scriptures of us Christians
   are divinely inspired; neither are they indefinite in their number, but
   determined, and reduced into a Canon. Those of the Old Testament are,
   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four books
   of Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
   Job, the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel." [21]

   Hilary, who was contemporary with Athanasius, and resided in France,
   has numbered the canonical books of the Old Testament, in the following
   manner: "The five books of Moses, the sixth of Joshua, the seventh of
   Judges, including Ruth, the eighth of first and second Kings, the ninth
   of third and fourth Kings; the tenth of the Chronicles, two books; the
   eleventh, Ezra (which included Nehemiah;) the twelfth, the Psalms.
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs, the thirteenth,
   fourteenth and fifteenth; the twelve Prophets the sixteenth; then
   Isaiah and Jeremiah, including Lamentations and his Epistle, Daniel,
   Ezekiel, Job, and Esther, making up the full number of twenty-two." And
   in his preface he adds, that "these books were thus numbered by our
   ancestors, and handed down by tradition from them." [22]

   Gregory Nazianzen exhorts his readers to study the sacred books with
   attention, but to avoid such as were apocryphal; and then gives a list
   of the books of the Old Testament, and according to the Jewish method,
   makes the number two-and-twenty. He complains of some that mingled the
   apocryphal books with those that were inspired, "of the truth of which
   last," says he, "we have the most perfect persuasion; therefore it
   seemed good to me to enumerate the canonical books from the beginning;
   and those which belong to the Old Testament are two-and-twenty,
   according to the number of the Hebrew alphabet, as I have understood."
   Then he proceeds to say, "Let no one add to these divine books, nor
   take any thing away from them. I think it necessary to add this, that
   there are other books besides those which I have enumerated as
   constituting the Canon, which, however, do not appertain to it; but
   were proposed by the early Fathers, to be read for the sake of the
   instruction which they contain." Then, he expressly names as belonging
   to this class, the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach, Esther,
   Judith, and Tobit. [23]

   Jerome, in his Epistle to Paulinus, gives us a catalogue of the books
   of the Old Testament, exactly corresponding with that which Protestants
   receive: "Which," says he, "we believe agreeably to the tradition of
   our ancestors, to have been inspired by the Holy Spirit."

   Epiphanius, in his book concerning Weights and Measures, distributes
   the books of the Old Testament into four divisions of five each. "The
   first of which contains the law, next five poetical books, Job, Psalms,
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs; in the third division he places
   Joshua, Judges, including Ruth, first and second Chronicles, four books
   of Kings. The last five, the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
   Ezekiel, Daniel. Then there remain two, Ezra and Esther." Thus he makes
   up the number twenty-two.

   Cyril of Jerusalem, in his Catechism, exhorts his catechumen diligently
   to learn from the church, what books appertain to the Old and New
   Testaments, and he says, "Read nothing which is apocryphal. Read the
   Scriptures, namely, the twenty-two books of the Old Testament, which
   were translated by the seventy-two interpreters." And in another place,
   "Meditate, as was said, in the twenty-two books of the Old Testament,
   and if you wish it, I will give you their names." Here follows a
   catalogue, agreeing with those already given, except that he adds
   Baruch to the list. When Baruch is mentioned as making one book with
   Jeremiah, as is done by some of the Fathers, it is most reasonable to
   understand those parts of Jeremiah, in the writing of which Baruch was
   concerned, as particularly the lii. chapter; for, if we understand them
   as referring to the separate book now called Baruch, the number which
   they are so careful to preserve will be exceeded. This apocryphal
   Baruch never existed in the Hebrew, and is never mentioned separately
   by any ancient author, as Bellarmine confesses. This book was
   originally written in Greek, but our present copies differ exceedingly
   from the old Latin translation.

   The Council of Laodicea forbade the reading of any books in the
   churches but such as were canonical; and that the people might know
   what these were, a catalogue was given, answering to the Canon which we
   now receive.

   Origen barely mentions the Maccabees. Athanasius takes no notice of
   these books. Eusebius, in his Chronicon, speaks of the History of the
   Maccabees, and adds, "These books are not received as divine
   Scriptures."

   Philastrius, an Italian bishop, who lived in the latter part of the
   fourth century, in a work on Heresy says, "It was determined by the
   apostles and their successors, that nothing should be read in the
   Catholic church but the law, prophets, evangelists," &c.--And he
   complains of certain Heretics, "That they used the book of Wisdom, by
   the son of Sirach, who lived long after Solomon."

   Chrysostom, a man who excelled in the knowledge of the Scriptures,
   declares, "That all the divine books of the Old Testament were
   originally written in the Hebrew tongue, and that no other books were
   received." Hom. 4. in Gen.

   But Jerome, already mentioned, who had diligently studied the Hebrew
   Scriptures, by the aid of the best Jewish teachers, enters into this
   subject more fully and accurately than any of the rest of the Fathers.
   In his general Preface to his version of the Scriptures, he mentions
   the books which he had translated out of Hebrew into Latin; "All
   besides them," says he, "must be placed among the apocryphal.
   Therefore, Wisdom, which is ascribed to Solomon, the book of Jesus the
   son of Sirach, Judith, Tobit and Pastor, are not in the Canon. I have
   found the first book of Maccabees in Hebrew, (Chaldee;) the second in
   Greek, and, as the style shows, it must have been composed in that
   language." And in his Preface to Ezra and Nehemiah, (always reckoned
   one book by the Jews,) he says, "Let no one be disturbed that I have
   edited but one book under this name; nor let any one please himself
   with the dreams contained in the third and fourth apocryphal books
   ascribed to this author; for, with the Hebrews, Ezra and Nehemiah make
   but one book; and those things not contained in this are to be
   rejected, as not belonging to the Canon." And in his preface to the
   books of Solomon, he speaks of "Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus; the former
   of which," he says, "he found in Hebrew, (Chaldee,) but not the latter,
   which is never found among the Hebrews, but the style strongly savours
   of the Grecian eloquence." He then adds, "As the church reads the books
   of Judith, Tobit, and the Maccabees, but does not receive them among
   the canonical Scriptures, so, also, she may read these two books for
   the edification of the common people, but not as authority to confirm
   any of the doctrines of the church."

   Again, in his preface to Jeremiah, he says, "The book of Baruch, the
   scribe of Jeremiah, is not read in Hebrew, nor esteemed canonical;
   therefore, I have passed it over." And in his preface to Daniel, "This
   book among the Hebrews has neither the history of Susanna, nor the Song
   of the three Children, nor the fables of Bel and the Dragon, which we
   have retained lest we should appear to the unskilful to have curtailed
   a large part of the Sacred Volume."

   In the preface to Tobit, he says, "The Hebrews cut off the book of
   Tobit from the catalogue of Divine Scriptures." And in his preface to
   Judith, he says, "Among the Hebrews, Judith is placed among the
   Hagiographa, which are not of authority to determine controversies."

   Rufin, in his Exposition of the Creed, observes, "That there were some
   books which were not called canonical, but received by our ancestors,
   as the Wisdom of Solomon, and another Wisdom of the Son of Sirach; of
   the same order are the books of Tobit, Judith, and the Maccabees."

   Gregory the First, speaking of the testimony in the Maccabees,
   respecting the death of Eleazer, says, "Concerning which thing we do
   not act inordinately, although we bring our testimony from a book which
   is not canonical."

   Augustine is the only one among the Fathers who lived within four
   hundred years after the apostles, who seems to favour the introduction
   of these six disputed books into the Canon. In his work On Christian
   Doctrine, he gives a list of the books of the Old Testament, among
   which he inserts Tobit, Judith, the two books of Maccabees, two of
   Esdras, Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus. These two last mentioned, he says,
   "are called Solomon's, on account of their resemblance to his writings;
   although it is known that one of them was composed by the son of
   Sirach: which deserves to be received among the prophetical books." But
   this opinion he retracted afterwards. [24]

   Augustine was accustomed to the Greek and Latin Bibles, in which those
   books had been introduced, and we must suppose, unless we would make
   him contradict himself, that he meant in this place merely to enumerate
   the books then contained in the sacred volume; for in many other places
   he clearly shows that he entertained the same opinion of the books of
   the Old Testament as the other Fathers.

   In his celebrated work of "The City of God," he expresses this opinion
   most explicitly--"In that whole period, after the return from the
   Babylonish captivity, after Malachi, Haggai, Zachariah and Ezra, they
   had no prophets, even until the time of the advent of our Saviour. As
   our Lord says, the law and the prophets were until John. And even the
   reprobate Jews hold that Haggai, Zachariah, Ezra, and Malachi, were the
   last books received into canonical authority."

   In his commentary on the xl. Psalm, he says, "If any adversary should
   say you have forged these prophecies, let the Jewish books be
   produced--The Jews are our librarians." And on the lvi. Psalm, "When we
   wish to prove to the Pagans that Christ was predicted, we appeal to the
   writings in possession of the Jews; they have all these Scriptures."

   And again, in the work first cited, "The Israelitish nation, to whom
   the oracles of God were entrusted, never confounded false prophecies
   with the true, but all these writings are harmonious." Then in another
   work, in speaking of the books of the Maccabees, he says, This writing
   the Jews never received in the same manner as the Law, the Prophets,
   and the Psalms, to which the Lord gave testimony as by his own
   witnesses." And frequently in his works, he confines the canonical
   books to those properly included in this threefold division. He also
   repeatedly declares that the canonical Scriptures, which are of most
   eminent authority, are the books committed to the Jews. But in the
   eighteenth book of the City of God, speaking of Judith, he says, "Those
   things which are written in this book, it is said, the Jews have never
   received into the Canon of Scripture." And in the seventeenth book of
   the same work, "There are three books of Solomon, which have been
   received into canonical authority, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and
   Canticles; the other two, Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, have been called
   by his name, through a custom which prevailed on account of their
   similarity to his writings; but the more learned are certain that they
   are not his; and they cannot be brought forward with much confidence
   for the conviction of gainsayers."

   He allows that the Book of Wisdom may be read to the people, and ought
   to be preferred to all other tracts; but he does not insist that the
   testimonies taken from it are decisive. And respecting Ecclesiasticus,
   he says when speaking of Samuel's prophesying after his death, "But if
   this book is objected to because it is not found in the Canon of the
   Jews," &c. His rejection of the books of Maccabees from the Canon is
   repeated and explicit. "The calculation of the times after the
   restoring of the temple is not found in the Holy Scriptures, which are
   called canonical, but in certain other books, among which are the two
   books of Maccabees. The Jews do not receive the Maccabees as the Law
   and the Prophets."

   It may be admitted, however, that Augustine entertained too high an
   opinion of these apocryphal books, but it is certain that he did not
   put them on a level with the genuine canonical books. He mentions a
   custom which prevailed in his time, from which it appears that although
   the apocryphal books were read in some of the churches, they were not
   read as Holy Scripture, nor put on a level with the canonical books;
   for he informs us that they were not permitted to be read from the same
   desk as the Canonical Scriptures, but from a lower place in the church.

   Innocent the first, who lived about the same time, is also alluded to
   as a witness to prove that these disputed books were then received into
   the Canon. But the epistle which contains his catalogue is extremely
   suspicious. No mention is made of this epistle by any writer for three
   hundred years after the death of Innocent. But it is noways necessary
   to our argument to deny that in the end of the fourth and beginning of
   the fifth century, some individuals, and perhaps some councils,
   received these books as canonical, yet there is strong evidence that
   this was not the opinion of the universal church; for in the council of
   Chalcedon, which is reckoned to be oecumenical, the Canons of the
   council of Laodicea which contain a catalogue of the genuine books of
   the Old Testament, are adopted. And it has been shown already that
   these apocryphal books were excluded from that catalogue.

   But it can be proved that even until the time of the meeting of the
   Council of Trent, by which these books were solemnly canonized, the
   most learned and judicious of the Popish writers adhere to the opinions
   of Jerome and the ancients; or at least make a marked distinction
   between these disputed books and those which are acknowledged to be
   canonical by all. A few testimonies from distinguished writers, from
   the commencement of the sixth century down to the era of the
   Reformation, shall now be given.

   It deserves to be particularly observed here that in one of the laws of
   the Emperor Justinian, concerning ecclesiastical matters, it was
   enacted, "That the Canons of the first four general councils should be
   received and have the force of laws."

   Anastasius, patriarch of Antioch, in a work on the Creation, makes "the
   number of books which God hath appointed for his Old Testament" to be
   no more than twenty-two; although he speaks in very high terms of
   Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus.

   Leontius, a learned and accurate writer, in his book against the Sects,
   acknowledges no other canonical books of the Old Testament, but those
   which the Hebrews received; namely, twelve historical books, five
   prophetical, four of Doctrine and Instruction, and one of Psalms;
   making the number twenty-two as usual; and he makes not the least
   mention of any others.

   Gregory, who lived at the beginning of the seventh century, in his book
   of Morals, makes an apology for alleging a passage from the Maccabees,
   and says, "Though it be not taken from the canonical Scripture, yet it
   is cited from a book which was published for the edification of the
   church."

   Isidore, bishop of Seville, divides the canonical books of the Old
   Testament into three orders, the Law, the Prophets, and the
   Hagiographa; and afterwards adds--"There is a fourth order of books
   which are not in the Hebrew Canon of the Old Testament." Here he names
   these books, and says, "Though the Jews rejected them as apocryphal,
   the church has received them among the canonical Scriptures."

   John Damascene, a Syrian Presbyter, who lived early in the eighth
   century, adheres to the Hebrew Canon of the Old Testament, numbering
   only two-and-twenty books. Of Maccabees, Judith and Tobit, he says not
   one word; but he speaks of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, as "elegant and
   virtuous writings, yet not to be numbered among the canonical books of
   Scripture, never having been laid up in the ark of the Covenant."

   Venerable Bede follows the ancient method of dividing the books of the
   Old Testament into three classes; but he remarkably distinguishes the
   Maccabees from the canonical books by classing them with the writings
   of Josephus and Julius the African.

   Alcuin, the disciple of Bede, says, "The book of the son of Sirach was
   reputed an apocryphal and dubious Scripture."

   Rupert, a learned man of the twelfth century, expressly rejects the
   book of Wisdom from the Canon.

   Peter Mauritius, after giving a catalogue of the authentic Scriptures
   of the Old Testament, adds the six disputed books, and says, "They are
   useful and commendable in the church, but are not to be placed in the
   same dignity with the rest."

   Hugo de S. Victore, a Saxon by birth, but who resided at Paris, gives a
   catalogue of the books of the Old Testament, which includes no others
   but the two-and-twenty received from the Jews. Of Wisdom,
   Ecclesiasticus, Tobit and Judith, he says, "They are used in the church
   but not written in the Canon."

   Richard de S. Victore, also of the twelfth century, in his Books of
   Collections, explicitly declares, "That there are but twenty-two books
   in the Canon; and that Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the
   Maccabees, are not esteemed canonical although they are read in the
   churches."

   Peter Lombard, in his Scholastic History, enumerates the books of the
   Old Testament, thus--Five books of Moses, eight of the prophets, and
   nine of the Hagiographa, which leaves no room for these six disputed
   books; but in his preface to Tobit he says expressly, that it is "in no
   order of the Canon;" and of Judith, that "Jerome and the Hebrews place
   it in the apocrypha." Moreover, he calls the story of Bel and the
   Dragon a fable, and says that the history of Susannah is not as true as
   it should be.

   In this century also lived John of Salisbury, an Englishman, a man
   highly respected in his time. In one of his Epistles, he treats this
   subject at large, and professes to follow Jerome and undoubtedly to
   believe that there are but twenty-two books in the Canon of the Old
   Testament, all which he names in order, and adds, "That neither the
   book of Wisdom, nor Ecclesiasticus, nor Judith, nor Tobit, nor the
   Pastor, nor the Maccabees, are esteemed canonical."

   In the thirteenth century, the opinion of the learned was the same, as
   we may see by the Ordinary Gloss on the Bible, in the composition of
   which many persons were concerned, and which was high approved by all
   the doctors and pastors in the western churches. In the preface to this
   gloss, they are reproached with ignorance who hold all the books, put
   into the one volume of Scripture, in equal veneration. The difference
   between these books is asserted to be as great as between certain and
   doubtful works. The canonical books are declared, "To have been written
   by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; but who were the authors of the
   others is unknown." Then it is declared, "That the church permitteth
   the reading of the apocryphal books for devotion and instruction, but
   not for authority to decide matters of controversy in faith. And that
   there are no more than twenty-two canonical books of the Old Testament,
   and all besides are apocryphal." 6Thus we have the common judgment of
   the church, in the thirteenth century, in direct opposition to the
   decree of the Council of Trent in the sixteenth. But this is not all,
   for when the writers of this Gloss come to the apocryphal books, they
   prefix a caution, as--"Here begins the book of Tobit, which is not in
   the Canon;"--"Here begins the book of Judith, which is not in the
   Canon," and so of every one of them; and to confirm their opinion, they
   appeal to the Fathers.

   Hugo, the Cardinal, who lived in this century, wrote commentaries on
   all the Scriptures, which were universally esteemed; in these he
   constantly keeps up the distinction between the canonical and
   ecclesiastical books: and he explicitly declares that "Ecclesiasticus,
   Wisdom, Judith, Tobit, and the Maccabees, are
   apocryphal,--dubious,--not canonical,--not received by the church for
   proving any matters of faith, but for information of manners."

   Thomas Aquinas also, the most famous of the schoolmen, makes the same
   distinction between these classes of books. He maintains that the book
   of Wisdom was not held to be a part of the Canon, and ascribes it to
   Philo. The story of Bel and the Dragon, he calls a fable; and he shows
   clearly enough that he did not believe that Ecclesiasticus was of
   canonical authority.

   In the fourteenth century no man acquired so extensive a reputation for
   his commentaries on the Bible, as Nicholas Lyra, a converted Jew. In
   his preface to the book of Tobit, he says, " That having commented on
   all the canonical books, from the beginning of Genesis to the end of
   Revelation, his intention now was to write on those books which are not
   canonical." Here he enumerates Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit,
   and the Maccabees; and then adds, "The canonical books are not only
   before these in time but in dignity and authority." And again, "These
   are not in the Canon, but received by the church to be read for
   instruction in manners, not to be used for deciding controversies
   respecting the faith; whereas the others are of such authority that
   whatever they contain is to be held as undoubted truth."

   The Englishman, William Occam, of Oxford, accounted the most learned
   doctor of his age, in his Dialogues, acknowledges, "That that honor is
   due only to the divine writers of Scripture, that we should esteem them
   free from all error." Moreover, in his Prologues, he fully assents to
   the opinion of Jerome and Gregory, "That neither Judith, nor Tobit, nor
   the Maccabees, nor Wisdom, nor Ecclesiasticus, is to be received into
   the same place of honour as the inspired books; "for," says he, "the
   church doth not number them among the canonical Scriptures."

   In the fifteenth century, Thomas Anglicus, sometimes called the
   Angelical Doctor on account of his excellent judgment, numbers
   twenty-four books of the Old Testament, if Ruth be reckoned separately
   from Judges, and Lamentations from Jeremiah.

   Paul Burgensis, a Spanish Jew, who, after his conversion to
   Christianity, on account of his superior knowledge and piety, was
   advanced to be bishop of Burgos, wrote notes on the Bible, in which he
   retains the same distinction of books which has been so often
   mentioned.

   The Romanists have at last, as they suppose, found an authority for
   these disputed books in the Council of Florence, from the Acts of which
   they produce a decree in which the six disputed books are named and
   expressly said to be written by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.

   Though this Canon were genuine, the authority of a council sitting in
   such circumstances, as attended the meeting of this, would have very
   little weight; but Dr. Cosins has shown that in the large copies of the
   acts of this council no such decree can be found, and that it has been
   foisted into the abridgment by some impostor who omitted something else
   to make room for it, and thus preserved the number of Canons unchanged,
   while the substance of them was altered.

   Alphonso Tostatus, bishop of Avila, who, on account of his
   extraordinary learning, was called the wonder of the world, has given a
   clear and decisive testimony on this subject. This learned man
   declares, "That these controverted books were not canonical, and that
   the church condemned no man for disobedience who did not receive them
   as the other Scriptures, because they were of uncertain origin, and it
   is not known that they were written by inspiration." And again,
   "Because the church is uncertain whether heretics have not added to
   them." This opinion he repeats in several parts of his works."

   Cardinal Ximenes, the celebrated editor of the Complutensian Polyglot,
   in the preface to that work, admonishes the reader that Judith, Tobit,
   Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Maccabees, with the additions to Esther and
   Daniel, which are found in the Greek, are not canonical Scriptures.

   John Picus, the learned count of Mirandula, adhered firmly to the
   opinion of Jerome and the other Fathers on the subject of the Canon.

   Faber Stapulensis, a famous doctor of Paris, acknowledges that these
   books are not in the Canon.

   Ludovicus Vives, one of the most learned men of his age, in his
   commentaries on Augustine's City of God, rejects the third and fourth
   books of Esdras, and also the history of Susannah, and Bel, as
   apocryphal. He speaks in such a manner of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus as
   to show that he did not esteem them canonical; for he makes Philo to be
   the author of the former, and the son of Sirach of the latter, who
   lived in the time of Ptolemy about an hundred years after the last of
   the Prophets; and of the Maccabees, he doubts whether Josephus was the
   author or not; by which he sufficiently shows that he did not believe
   that they were written by inspiration.

   But there was no man in this age who obtained so high a reputation for
   learning and critical skill as Erasmus. In his exposition of the
   Apostles' Creed and the Decalogue, he discusses this question
   respecting the canonical books, and after enumerating the usual books
   of the Old Testament, he says, "The ancient Fathers admitted no more;"
   but of the other books afterwards received into ecclesiastical use,
   (naming the whole which we esteem apocryphal,) "It is uncertain what
   authority should be allowed to them; but the canonical Scriptures are
   such as without controversy are believed to have been written by the
   inspiration of God." And in his Scholia on Jerome's preface to Daniel,
   he expresses his wonder that such stories as Bel and the Dragon should
   be publicly read in the churches. In his address to students of the
   Scriptures, he admonishes them to consider well, "That the church never
   intended to give the same authority to Tobit, Judith and Wisdom, which
   is given to the five books of Moses or the four Evangelists."

   The last testimony which we shall adduce to show that these books were
   not universally nor commonly received, until the very time of the
   Council of Trent, is that of Cardinal Cajetan, the oracle of the church
   of Rome. In his commentaries on the Bible, he gives us this as the rule
   of the church--"That those books which were canonical with Jerome
   should be so with us; and that those which were not received as
   canonical by him should be considered as excluded by us." And he says,
   "The church is much indebted to this Father for distinguishing between
   the books which are canonical and those which are not, for thus he has
   freed us from the reproach of the Hebrews, who otherwise might say that
   we had framed a new Canon for ourselves." For this reason he would
   write no commentaries on these apocryphal books; "for," says he,
   "Judith, Tobit, Maccabees, Wisdom, and the additions to Esther are all
   excluded from the Canon as insufficient to prove any matter of faith,
   though they may be read for the edifying of the people."

   From the copious citations of testimonies which we have given, it is
   evident that the books in dispute are apocryphal, and have no right to
   a place in the Canon; and that the Council of Trent acted unwisely in
   decreeing, with an anathema annexed, that they should be received as
   divine. Surely no council can make that an inspired book which was not
   written by inspiration. Certainly these books did not belong to the
   Canon while the apostles lived, for they were unknown both to Jews and
   Christians. Sixtus Sinensis, a distinguished Romanist, acknowledges
   that it was long after the time of the apostles, that these writings
   came to the knowledge of the whole Christian church. But while this is
   conceded, it does not terminate the controversy, for among the many
   extraordinary claims of the Romish church, one of the most
   extraordinary is the authority to add to the Canon of Holy Scripture.
   It has been made sufficiently manifest that these apocryphal books were
   not included in the Canon during the first three centuries; and can it
   be doubted whether the Canon was fully constituted before the fourth
   century? To suppose that a Pope or a Council can make what books they
   please canonical, is too absurd to deserve a moment's consideration.
   If, upon this principle, they could render Tobit and Judith canonical,
   upon the same they might introduce Herodotus, Livy, or even the Koran
   itself.

SECTION V.

   INTERNAL EVIDENCE THAT THESE BOOKS ARE NOT CANONICAL--THE WRITERS NOT
   PROPHETS, AND DO NOT CLAIM TO BE INSPIRED.

   I COME now to the fifth argument to disprove the canonical authority of
   these books, which is derived from internal evidence. Books which
   contain manifest falsehoods; or which abound in silly and ridiculous
   stories; or contradict the plain and uniform doctrine of acknowledged
   Scripture, cannot be canonical. Now I will endeavour to show, that the
   books in dispute, are all, or most of them, condemned by this rule.

   In the book of Tobit, an angel of God is made to tell a palpable
   falsehood--"I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy
   brethren;" [25] by which Tobit was completely deceived, for he says,
   "Thou art of an honest and good stock." Now in chapter xii. this same
   angel declares, "I am Raphael, one of the seven Holy Angels, which
   present the prayers of the saints, and go in and out before the glory
   of the Holy One."

   Judith is represented as speaking scarcely anything but falsehood to
   Holofernes; but what is most inconsistent with the character of piety
   given her, is, that she is made to pray to the God of truth, in the
   following words, "Smite by the deceit of my lips, the servant with the
   prince, and the prince with the servant." Who does not perceive, at
   once, the impiety of this prayer? It is a petition that he who holds in
   utter detestation all falsehood, should give efficacy to premeditated
   deceit. This woman, so celebrated for her piety, is also made to speak
   with commendation of the conduct of Simeon, in the cruel slaughter of
   the Shechemites; an act, against which God, in the Scriptures, has
   expressed his high displeasure.

   In the second book of Maccabees, Razis, an elder of Jerusalem, is
   spoken of with high commendation, for destroying his own life, rather
   than fall into the hands of his enemies; but, certainly, suicide is
   not, in any case, agreeable to the word of God.

   The author of the book of Wisdom, speaks in the name of Solomon, and
   talks about being appointed to build a temple in the holy mountain;
   whereas it has been proved by Jerome, that this book is falsely
   ascribed to Solomon.

   In the book of Tobit, we have this story: "And as they went on their
   journey they came to the river Tigris, and they lodged there; and when
   the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the
   river, and would have devoured him. Then the angel said unto him, Take
   the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish and drew it to land.
   To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart, and the
   liver, and the gall, and put them up safely. So the young man did as
   the angel commanded him, and when they had roasted the fish, they did
   eat it. Then the young man said unto the angel, Brother Azarias, to
   what use is the heart, and the liver, and the gall of the fish? And he
   said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil, or an evil
   spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the
   woman, and the party shall be no more vexed. As for the gall, it is
   good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes; and he shall be
   healed." [26] If this story does not savour of the fabulous, then it
   would be difficult to find anything that did.

   In the book of Baruch, there are also several things which do not
   appear to be true. Baruch is said to have read this book, in the fifth
   year after the destruction of Jerusalem, in the ears of the king, and
   all the people dwelling in Babylon, who upon hearing it, collected
   money and sent it to Jerusalem, to the priests. [27] Now Baruch, who is
   here alleged to have read this book in Babylon, is said, in the
   canonical Scriptures, to have been carried captive into Egypt, with
   Jeremiah, after the murder of Gedaliah. Jer. xliii. 6. Again, he is
   represented to have read in the ears of Jeconias the king, and of all
   the people; but Jeconias is known to have been shut up in prison, at
   this time, and it is nowise probable that Baruch would have access to
   him, if he even had been in Babylon. The money that was sent from
   Babylon was to enable the priests to offer sacrifices to the Lord, but
   the temple was in ruins, and there was no altar. [28]

   In the chapters added to the book of Esther, we read, that "Mardocheus,
   in the second year of Artaxerxes the Great, was a great man, being a
   servitor in the king's court." And in the same, "That he was also one
   of the captives which Nabuchodonosor carried from Jerusalem, with
   Jeconias, king of Judea." Now, between these two periods, there
   intervened one hundred and fifty years; so that, if he was only fifteen
   years of age, when carried away, he must have been a servitor in the
   king's court, at the age of one hundred and seventy-five years!

   Again, Mardocheus is represented as being "a great man in the court, in
   the second year of Artaxerxes," before he detected the conspiracy
   against the king's life. Now, Artaxerxes and Ahasuerus were the same,
   or they were not; if the former, this history clashes with the
   Scriptural account, for there it appears, that Mordecai was not, before
   this time, a courtier, or a conspicuous man; if the latter, then this
   addition is manifestly false, because it ascribes to Artaxerxes, what
   the Scriptures ascribe to another person.

   Moreover, this apocryphal writing places the conspiracy against the
   king's life before the repudiation of Vashti and the marriage of
   Esther; but this is repugnant to the canonical Scriptures.

   It is also asserted, in this book, (see chap. xvi.) that Mardocheus
   received honours and rewards for the detection of the conspiracy;
   whereas, in the Canonical book of Esther, it is declared, that he
   received no reward. And a different reason is assigned, in the two
   books, for Haman's hatred of Mordecai. In the canonical, it is his
   neglect of showing respect to this proud courtier; in the apocryphal,
   it is the punishment of the two eunuchs, who had formed the conspiracy.

   And finally, Haman, in this spurious work, is called a Macedonian; and
   it is said, that he meditated the design of transferring the Persian
   kingdom to the Macedonians. But this is utterly incredible. The kingdom
   of Macedon must have been, at that time, most obscure, and probably
   wholly unknown, at the Persian court. But this is not all: he who is
   here called a Macedonian, is in the canonical book said to be an
   Agagite. The proof of the apocryphal character of this addition to
   Esther, which has been adduced, is in all reason sufficient.

   The advocates of these books are greatly perplexed to find a place in
   the history of the Jewish nation, for the wonderful deliverance wrought
   by means of Judith. It seems strange that no allusion is made to this
   event in any of the acknowledged books of Scripture; and more
   unaccountable still, that Josephus, who was so much disposed to relate
   everything favourable to the character of his nation, should never make
   the least mention of it. Some refer this history to the period
   preceding the Babylonish captivity; while others are of opinion, that
   the events occurred in the time of Cambyses, king of Persia. But the
   name of the high priest here mentioned, does not occur with the names
   of the high priests contained in any of the genealogies. From the time
   of the building of the temple of Solomon, to its overthrow by the
   Assyrians, this name is not found in the list of high priests, as may
   be seen by consulting the vi. chapter of 1 Chronicles; nor, in the
   catalogue given by Josephus, in the tenth chapter of the tenth book of
   his Antiquities. That this history cannot be placed after the
   captivity, is manifest, from this circumstance, that the temple of
   Solomon was still standing when the transactions which are related in
   this book occurred.

   Another thing in the book of Judith, which is very suspicious, is, that
   Holofernes is represented as saying, "Tell me now, ye sons of Canaan,
   who this people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are the
   cities that they inhabit." But how can it be reconciled with known
   history, that a prince of Persia should be wholly ignorant of the
   Jewish people?

   It is impossible to reconcile what is said, in the close of the book,
   with any sound principles of chronology. Judith is represented as young
   and beautiful, when she slew Holofernes; but here it is said, "That she
   waxed old in her husband's house, being an hundred and five years old.
   And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afraid, in
   the days of Judith nor a long time after her death." In whose reign, or
   at what period, we would ask, did the Jews enjoy this long season of
   uninterrupted tranquillity?

   Some writers who are fully convinced that the history of Judith cannot
   be reconciled with authentic history, if taken literally, are of
   opinion, that it contains a beautiful allegory;--that Bethulia, (the
   virgin,) represents the church of God; that the assault of
   Nebuchadnezzar signifies the opposition of the world and its prince;
   that the victory obtained by a pious woman, is intended to teach, that
   the church's deliverance is not effected by human might or power, but
   by the prayers and the piety of the saints, &c. This, perhaps, is the
   most favourable view which we can take of this history: but take it as
   you will, it is clear that the book is apocryphal, and has no right to
   a place in the sacred Canon.

   Between the first and second books of Maccabees, there is a palpable
   contradiction; for in the first book it is said, that "Judas died in
   the one hundred and fifty-second year:" but in the second, "that in the
   one hundred and eighty-eighth year, the people that were in Judea, and
   Judas, and the council, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus."
   Thus, Judas is made to join in sending a letter, six-and-thirty years
   after his death! The contradiction is manifest. In the same first
   chapter of the second book, there is a story inserted which has very
   much the air of a fable. "For when our fathers were led into Persia,
   the priests that were then devout, took the fire of the altar privily
   and hid it in a hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it
   sure, so that the place was unknown to all men. Now after many years,
   when it pleased God, Nehemias, being sent from the king, of Persia, did
   send of the posterity of those priests that had hid it, to the fire:
   but when they told us they found no fire, but thick water, then
   commanded he them to draw it up and bring it, and when the sacrifice
   was laid on, Nehemias commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and
   things laid thereon, with the water. When this was done and the time
   came that the sun shone, which before was hid in the clouds, a great
   fire was kindled." 2 Mac. ix. But the Jews were not carried to Persia
   but to Babylon, and the rest of the story has no foundation, whatever,
   in truth.

   In the second chapter we have another fabulous story of Jeremiah's
   taking the ark and altar, and altar of incense, to mount Pisgah, and
   hiding them in a hollow cave, and closing them up. This place Jeremiah
   declared should be unknown, "until the time that God gathered his
   people again together, and received them into mercy; when the cloud as
   it appeared unto Moses, should appear again." 1 Mac. viii. 16.

   There is another contradiction between these books of Maccabees, in
   relation to the death of Antiochus Epiphanes. In the first, it is said,
   that he died at Elymais, in Persia, in the hundred and forty-ninth
   year; but, in the second book, it is related, that after entering
   Persepolis, with a view of overthrowing the temple and city, he was
   repulsed by the inhabitants; and while on his journey from this place,
   he was seized with a dreadful disease of the bowels, and died in the
   mountains. 1 Mac. vi.; 2 Mac. ix.

   Moreover, the accounts given of Nicanor, in the seventh chapter of the
   first book, and in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters of the second
   book, are totally inconsistent. In the first book of Maccabees an
   erroneous account is given of the civil government of the Romans, where
   it is said, "That they committed their government to one man every
   year, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient to
   that one." Whereas, it is well known, that no such form of government
   ever existed among the Romans.

   Finally, it is manifest that these books were not inspired, and
   therefore not canonical, because they were not written by prophets; but
   by men who speak of their labours in a way wholly incompatible with
   inspiration.

   Jerome and Eusebius were of opinion, that Josephus was the author of
   the books of the Maccabees; but it has never been supposed by any, that
   he was an inspired man; therefore, if this opinion be correct, these
   books are no more canonical, than the Antiquities, or Wars of the Jews,
   by the same author.

   It has been the constant tradition of Jews and Christians, that the
   spirit of prophecy ceased with Malachi, until the appearance of John
   the Baptist. Malachi has, on this account, been called by the Jews,
   "the seal of the prophets."

   Josephus, in his book against Apion, after saying that it belonged to
   the prophets alone, to write inspired books, adds these words, "From
   the time of Artaxerxes, there were some among us, who wrote books even
   to our own times, but these are not of equal authority with the
   preceding, because the succession of prophets was not complete."

   Eusebius, in giving a catalogue of the leaders of the Jews, denies that
   he can proceed any lower than Zerubbabel, "Because," says he, "after
   the return from captivity until the advent of our Saviour, there is no
   book which can be esteemed sacred."

   Augustine gives a similar testimony. "After Malachi the Jews had no
   prophet, during that whole period, which intervened between the return
   from captivity and the advent of our Saviour."

   Neither does Genebrard dissent from this opinion. "From Malachi to John
   the Baptist," says he, "no prophets existed."

   Drusius cites the following words, from the Compiler of the Jewish
   History, "' The rest of the discourses of Simon and his wars, and the
   wars of his brother, are they not written in the book of Joseph, the
   son of Gorion, and in the book of the Asmoneans, and in the books of
   the Roman kings?" Here the books of the Maccabees are placed between
   the writings of Josephus and the Roman history.

   The book of Wisdom does indeed claim to be the work of Solomon, an
   inspired man; but this claim furnishes the strongest ground for its
   condemnation. It is capable of the clearest proof from internal
   evidence, that this was the production of some person, probably a
   Hellenistic Jew, who lived long after the Canon of the Old Testament
   was completed. It contains manifest allusions to Grecian customs, and
   is tinctured with the Grecian philosophy. The manner in which the
   author praises himself is fulsome, and has no parallel in an inspired
   writer. This book has been ascribed to Philo Judæus; and if this
   conjecture be correct, doubtless it has no just claim to be considered
   a canonical book. But whoever was the author, his endeavouring to pass
   his composition off for the writing of Solomon, is sufficient to decide
   every question respecting his inspiration. If Solomon had written this
   book, it would have been found in the Jewish Canon, and in the Hebrew
   language. The writer is also guilty of shameful flattery to his own
   nation, which is entirely repugnant to the spirit of all the prophets.
   He has also, without any foundation, added many things to the sacred
   narration, contained in the canonical history; and has mingled with it
   much which is of the nature of poetical embellishment. And, indeed, the
   whole style of the composition savours too much of artificial
   eloquence, to be attributed to the Spirit of God; the constant
   characteristic of whose productions is, simplicity and sublimity.

   Ecclesiasticus, which is superior to all the other apocryphal books,
   was written by one Jesus the son of Sirach. His grandfather, of the
   same name, it seems, had written a book, which he left to his son
   Sirach; and he delivered it to his son Jesus, who took great pains to
   reduce it into order; but he no where assumes the character of a
   prophet himself, nor does he claim it for the original author, his
   grandfather. In the prologue, he says. "My grandfather, Jesus, when he
   had much given himself to the reading of the law and the prophets, and
   other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was
   drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and
   wisdom, to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are
   addicted to these things, might profit much more, in living according
   to the law. Wherefore let me entreat you to read it with favour and
   attention, and to pardon us wherein we may seem to come short of some
   words which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things uttered
   in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force
   in them. For in the eight-and-thirtieth year, coming into Egypt when
   Euergetes was king, and continuing there for some time, I found a book
   of no small learning: therefore I thought it most necessary for me to
   bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it; using great
   watchfulness, and skill, in that space, to bring the book to an end,"
   &c. Surely there is no need of further arguments to prove that this
   modest author did not claim to be inspired.

   The author of the second book of the Maccabees professes to have
   reduced a work of Jason of Cyrene, consisting of five volumes, into one
   volume. Concerning which work, he says, "therefore to us that have
   taken upon us this painful labour of abridging, it was not easy, but a
   matter of sweat and watching." Again, "leaving to the author the exact
   handling of every particular, and labouring to follow the rules of an
   abridgment--to stand upon every point, and go over things at large, and
   to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of the
   story; but to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, is to
   be granted to him that maketh an abridgment." Is any thing more needed
   to prove that this writer did not profess to be inspired? If there was
   any inspiration in the case, it must be attributed to Jason of Cyrene,
   the original writer of the history;--but his work is long since lost,
   and we now possess only the abridgment which cost the writer so much
   labour and pains. Thus, I think it sufficiently appears, that the
   authors of these disputed books were not prophets; and that, as far as
   we can ascertain the circumstances in which they wrote, they did not
   lay claim to inspiration, but expressed themselves in such a way, as no
   man under the influence of inspiration ever did.

   The Popish writers, to evade the force of the arguments of their
   adversaries, pretend that there was a two-fold Canon; that some of the
   books of Scripture are proto-canonical; and others deutero-canonical.
   If, by this distinction, they only meant that the word Canon was often
   used by the Fathers, with great latitude, so as to include all books
   that were ever read in the churches, or that were contained in the
   volume of the Greek Bible, the distinction is correct, and signifies
   the same, as is often expressed, by calling some books sacred and
   canonical, and others, ecclesiastical. But these writers make it
   manifest that they mean much more than this. They wish to put their
   deutero-canonical books, on a level with the old Jewish Canon; and this
   distinction is intended to teach, that after the first Canon was
   constituted, other books were, from time to time, added: but when these
   books thus annexed to the Canon have been pronounced upon by the
   competent authority, they are to be received as of equal authority with
   the former. When this second Canon was constituted, is a matter
   concerning which they are not agreed; some pretend, that in the time of
   Shammai and Hillel, two famous rabbies, who lived before the advent of
   the Saviour, these books were added to the Canon. But why then are they
   not included in the Hebrew Canon? Why does Josephus never mention them?
   Why are they never quoted nor alluded to in the New Testament? And why
   did all the earlier Fathers omit to cite them, or expressly reject
   them? The difficulties of this theory being too prominent, the most of
   the advocates of the apocrypha, suppose, that these books, after having
   remained in doubt before, were received by the supreme authority of the
   church, in the fourth century. They allege, that these books were
   sanctioned by the council of Nice, and by the third council of
   Carthage, which met A. D. 397. But the story of the method pursued by
   the council of Nice, to distinguish between canonical and spurious
   books, is fabulous and ridiculous. There is nothing in the Canons of
   that council relative to these books; and certainly, they cited no
   authorities from them, in confirmation of the doctrines established by
   them. And as to the third council of Carthage, it may be asked, what
   authority had this provincial synod to determine anything for the whole
   church, respecting the Canon? But there is no certainty that this
   council did determine anything on the subject; for in the same Canon,
   there is mention made of Pope Boniface, as living at that time, whereas
   he did not rise to this dignity, until more than twenty years
   afterwards; in which time, three other popes occupied the See of Rome;
   so that this Canon could not have been formed by the third council of
   Carthage. And in some copies it is inserted, as the fourteenth of the
   seventh council of Carthage. However this may be, we may be confident,
   that no council of the fourth century had any authority to add to the
   Canon of Scripture, books which were not only not received before, but
   explicitly rejected as apocryphal, by most of the Fathers. Our
   opponents say, that these books were uncertain before, but now received
   confirmation. How could there be any uncertainty, in regard to these
   books, if the church was as infallible, in the first three ages, as in
   the fourth. These books were either canonical before the fourth
   century, or they were not: if the former, how came it to pass that they
   were not recognized by the apostles? How came they to be overlooked and
   rejected by the primitive Fathers? But if they were not canonical
   before, they must have been made canonical by the decree of some
   council. That is, the church can make that an inspired book, which was
   never given by inspiration. This absurdity was mentioned before, but it
   deserves to be repeated, because, however unreasonable it may be, it
   forms the true, and almost the only ground, on which the doctrine of
   the Romish church, in regard to these apocryphal books, rests. This is,
   indeed, a part of the Pope's supremacy, Some of their best writers,
   however, deny this doctrine; and whatever others may pretend, it is
   most certain, that the Fathers, with one consent, believed that the
   Canon of sacred Scripture was complete in their time: they never
   dreamed of books not then canonical, becoming such, by any authority
   upon earth. Indeed, the idea of adding to the Canon, what did not, from
   the beginning, belong to it, never seems to have entered the mind of
   any person in former times. If this doctrine were correct, we might
   still have additions made to the Canon, and that too, of books which
   have existed for hundreds of years.

   This question may be brought to a speedy issue, with all unprejudiced
   judges. These books were either written by divine inspiration for the
   guidance of the church in matters of faith and practice, or they were
   not; if the former, they always had a right to a place in the Canon; if
   the latter, no act of a pope or council could render that divine, which
   was not so before. It would be to change the nature of a fact, than
   which nothing is more impossible.

   It is alleged, with much confidence, that the Greek Bibles, used by the
   Fathers, contained these books; and, therefore, whenever they give
   their testimony to the sacred Scriptures, these are included. This
   argument proves too much, for the third book of Esdras and the Prayer
   of Manasses were contained in these volumes, but these are rejected by
   the Romanists. The truth, however, is, that these books were not
   originally connected with the Septuagint; they were probably introduced
   into some of the later Greek versions, which were made by heretics.
   These versions, particularly that of Theodotion, came to be used
   promiscuously with that of the LXX; and to this day, the common copies
   contain the version of the book of Daniel by Theodotion, instead of
   that by the LXX.

   By some such means, these apocryphal books crept into the Greek Bible;
   but the early Fathers were careful to distinguish them from the
   canonical Scriptures, as we have already seen. That they were read in
   the churches, is also true; but not as Scripture; not for the
   confirmation of doctrine, but for the edification of the common people.

   Some of the Fathers, it is true, cited them as authority, but very
   seldom, and the reason which rendered it difficult for them to
   distinguish accurately between ecclesiastical and canonical books has
   already been given. These pious men were generally unacquainted with
   Hebrew literature, and finding all these books in Greek, and frequently
   bound up in the same volume with the canonical Scriptures, and
   observing that they contained excellent rules for the direction of life
   and the regulation of morals, they sometimes referred to them, and
   cited passages from them, and permitted them to be read in the church,
   for the instruction and edification of the people.

   But the more learned of the Fathers, who examined into the authority of
   the sacred books with unceasing diligence, clearly marked the
   distinction between such books as were canonical, and such as were
   merely human compositions. And some of them even disapproved of the
   reading of these apocryphal books by the people; and some councils
   warned the churches against them. It was with this single view that so
   many catalogues of the canonical books were prepared and published.

   Notwithstanding that we have taken so much pains to show that the books
   called apocrypha, are not canonical, we wish to avoid the opposite
   extreme of regarding them as useless, or injurious. Some of these books
   are important for the historical information which they contain; and,
   especially, as the facts recorded in them, are, in some instances, the
   fulfilment of remarkable prophecies.

   Others of them are replete with sacred, moral, and prudential maxims,
   very useful to aid in the regulation of life and manners; but even with
   these, are interspersed sentiments, which are not perfectly accordant
   with the word of God. In short, these books are of very different
   value, but in the best of them there is so much error and imperfection,
   as to convince us, that they are human productions, and should be used
   as such: not as an infallible rule, but as useful helps in the
   attainment of knowledge, and in the practice of virtue. Therefore, when
   we would exclude them from a place in the Bible, we would not proscribe
   them as unfit to be read; but we would have them published in a
   separate volume, and studied much more carefully than they commonly
   have been.

   And while we would dissent from the practice of reading lessons from
   these books, as Scriptural lessons are read in the church, we would
   cordially recommend the frequent perusal, in private, of the first of
   Maccabees, the Wisdom of Solomon, and above all Ecclesiasticus.

   It is a dishonour to God, and a disparagement of his word, to place
   other books, in any respect on a level with the divine oracles; but it
   is a privilege to be permitted, to have access to the writings of men,
   eminent for their wisdom and piety. And it is also a matter of curious
   instruction to learn, what were the opinions of men, in ages long past,
   and in countries far remote.

   The infallibility of the church of Rome is clearly proved to be without
   foundation, by the decree of the Council of Trent, canonizing the
   apocrypha. If we have been successful in proving that these books are
   not canonical, the infallibility of both popes and councils is
   overthrown; for if they erred in one instance, it proves that the
   doctrine is false. One great inconvenience of this doctrine is, that
   when that church falls into any error, she can never retract it; for
   that would be to acknowledge her fallibility.

   Some allege that the church of Rome is not now what she was in former
   years; but that she has laid aside opinions formerly entertained. But
   this allegation is inconsistent with her claim to infallibility.
   According to this, the church of Rome has never erred; what she has
   declared to be true at any time she must forever maintain to be true;
   or give up her pretensions to infallibility. In regard to the
   Apocrypha, it is immaterial, whether the infallibility be supposed to
   reside in the pope or in a council; or in the pope and council united;
   for the council of Trent is considered to be an oecumenical council
   regularly constituted; and all its acts were sanctioned by the popes.
   Their error in pronouncing the apocrypha canonical, is decisive as to
   the infallibility of the church.

SECTION VI.

   NO CANONICAL BOOK OF THE OLD TESTAMENT HAS BEEN LOST.

   ON this subject there has existed some diversity of opinion. Chrysostom
   is cited by Bellarmine, as saying, " That many of the writings of the
   prophets had perished, which may readily be proved from the history in
   Chronicles. For the Jews were negligent, and not only negligent but
   impious, so that some books were lost through carelessness, and others
   were burned, or otherwise destroyed."

   In confirmation of this opinion, an appeal is made to 1 Kings iv. 32,
   33, where it is said of Solomon, "That he spake three thousand
   proverbs, and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of
   trees, from the cedar in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop, that springeth
   out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping
   things, and of fishes." All these productions, it is acknowledged, nave
   perished.

   Again it is said in 1 Chron. xxix. 29, 30. "Now the acts of David the
   king, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the
   seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the
   seer; with all his reign, and his might, and the times that went over
   him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries." The
   book of Jasher, also, is twice mentioned in Scripture. In Joshua x. 13,
   "And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had
   avenged themselves on their enemies. Is not this written in the book of
   Jasher?" And in 2 Sam. i. 18, "And he bade them teach the children of
   Israel the use of the bow: behold it is written in the book of Jasher."

   The book of the Wars of the Lord is referred to, in Num. xxi. 14. But
   we have in the Canon no books under the name of Nathan and Gad: nor any
   book of Jasher; nor of the Wars of the Lord.

   Moreover, we frequently are referred, in the sacred history, to other
   chronicles or annals, for a fuller account of the matters spoken of,
   which Chronicles are not now extant.

   And in 2 Chron. ix. 29, it is said, "Now the rest of the acts of
   Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the
   prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the
   visions of Iddo the seer, against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?" Now it is
   well known, that none of these writings of the prophets are in the
   Canon; at least, none of them under their names.

   It is said also in 2 Chron. xii. 15, "Now the acts of Rehoboam, first
   and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and
   of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogies?" Of which works nothing
   remains, under the names of these prophets.

   1. The first observation which I would make on this subject, is, that
   every book referred to, or quoted in the sacred writings, is not
   necessarily an inspired, or canonical book. Because Paul cites passages
   from the Greek poets, it does not follow that we must receive their
   poems as inspired.

   2. A book may be written by an inspired man, and yet be neither
   inspired nor canonical. Inspiration was not constantly afforded to the
   prophets, but was occasional, and for particular important purposes. In
   common matters, and especially in things noways connected with
   religion, it is reasonable to suppose, that the prophets and apostles
   were left to the same guidance of reason and common sense, as other
   men. A man, therefore, inspired to deliver some prophecy, or even to
   write a canonical book, might write other books, with no greater
   assistance than other good men receive. Because Solomon was inspired to
   write some canonical books, it does not follow, that what he wrote on
   natural history, was also inspired. The Scriptures, however, do not
   say, that his three thousand proverbs, and his discourses on natural
   history, were ever committed to writing. It only says, that he spake
   these things. But supposing that all these discourses were committed to
   writing, which is not improbable, there is not the least reason for
   believing that they were inspired, any more than Solomon's private
   letters to his friends, if he ever wrote any. Let it be remembered,
   that the prophets and apostles were only inspired on special occasions,
   and on particular subjects, and all difficulties respecting such works
   as these will vanish. How many of the books referred to in the Bible,
   and mentioned above, may have been of this description, it is now
   impossible to tell; but probably several of them belong to this class.
   No doubt there were many books of annals, much more minute and
   particular in the narration of facts, than those which we have. It was
   often enough to refer to these state papers, or public documents, as
   being sufficiently correct, in regard to the facts on account of which
   the reference was made. There is nothing derogatory to the word of God,
   in the supposition that the books of Kings and Chronicles, which we
   have in the Canon, were compiled by the inspired prophets from these
   public records. All that is necessary for us, is, that the facts are
   truly related; and this could be as infallibly secured on this
   hypothesis, as on any other.

   The book of the Wars of the Lord, might for aught that appears, have
   been merely a muster roll of the army. The word translated book has so
   extensive a meaning in Hebrew, that it is not even necessary to
   suppose, that it was a writing at all. The book of Jasher, (or of
   rectitude, if we translate the word,) might have been some useful
   compend taken from Scripture, or composed by the wise, for the
   regulation of justice and equity, between man and man.

   Augustine, in his City of God, has distinguished accurately on this
   subject. "I think," says he, "that those books which should have
   authority in religion were revealed by the Holy Spirit, and that men
   composed others by historical diligence, as the prophets did these by
   inspiration. And these two classes of books are so distinct, that it is
   only of those written by inspiration, that we are to suppose God,
   through them, to be speaking unto us. The one class is useful for
   fulness of knowledge; the other for authority in religion; in which
   authority the Canon is preserved."

   3. But again, it may be maintained, without any prejudice to the
   completeness of the Canon, that there may have been inspired writings
   which were not intended for the instruction of the church in all ages,
   but composed by the prophets for some special occasion. These writings,
   though inspired, were not canonical. They were temporary in their
   design, and when that was accomplished, they were no longer needed. We
   know that the prophets delivered, by inspiration, many discourses to
   the people, of which we have not a trace on record. Many true prophets
   are mentioned, who wrote nothing that we know of; and several are
   mentioned, whose names are not even given. The same is true of the
   apostles. Very few of them had any concern in writing the canonical
   Scriptures, and yet they all possessed plenary inspiration. And if they
   wrote letters, on special occasions, to the churches planted by them;
   yet these were not designed for the perpetual instruction of the
   universal church. Therefore Shemaiah, and Iddo, and Nathan, and Gad,
   might have written some things by inspiration, which were never
   intended to form a part of the Sacred Volume. It is not asserted, that
   there certainly existed such temporary inspired writings: all that is
   necessary to be maintained, is, that supposing such to have existed,
   which is not improbable, it does not follow that the Canon is
   incomplete, by reason of their loss. As this opinion may be startling
   to some, who have not thoroughly considered it, I will call in to its
   support the opinions of some distinguished theologians.

   "It has been observed," says Francis Junius, "that it is one thing to
   call a book sacred, another to say that it is canonical; for every book
   was sacred which was edited by a prophet, or apostle; but it does not
   follow that every such sacred book is canonical, and was designed for
   the whole body of the church. For example, it is credible that Isaiah
   the prophet wrote many things, as a prophet, which were truly inspired,
   but those writings only were canonical, which God consecrated to the
   treasure of the church, and which by special direction were added to
   the public Canon. Thus Paul and the other apostles may have written
   many things, by divine inspiration, which are not now extant; but those
   only are canonical, which were placed in the Sacred Volume, for the use
   of the universal church: which Canon received the approbation of the
   apostles, especially of John, who so long presided over the churches in
   Asia." [29]

   The evangelical Witsius, of an age somewhat later, delivers his opinion
   on this point, in the following manner: "No one, I think, can doubt,
   but that all the apostles in the diligent exercise of their office,
   wrote frequent letters to the churches under their care, when they
   could not be present with them; and to whom they might often wish to
   communicate some instruction necessary for them in the circumstances in
   which they were placed. It would seem to me to be injurious to the
   reputation of those faithful and assiduous men, to suppose, that not
   one of them ever wrote any epistle, or addressed to a church, any
   writing, except those few, whose epistles are in the Canon. Now, as
   Peter, and Paul, and James, and John, were induced to write to the
   churches, on account of the need in which they stood of instruction,
   why would not the same necessity induce the other apostles to write to
   the churches under their care? Nor is there any reason why we should
   complain of the great loss which we have sustained, because these
   precious documents have perished; it is rather matter of gratitude,
   that so many have been preserved by the provident benevolence of God
   towards us, and so abundantly sufficient to instruct us, in the things
   pertaining to salvation." [30]

   Although I have cited this passage from this excellent and orthodox
   theologian, in favour of the sentiment advanced; yet I do not feel at
   liberty to go the whole length of his opinion, here expressed. There is
   no reason to think, that any of the other apostles composed such works,
   as those which constitute the Canon of the New Testament. If they had,
   some of them would have been preserved, or at least, some memorial of
   such writings would have been handed down, in those churches to which
   they were addressed. These churches received and preserved the
   canonical books of those whose writings we have, and why should they
   neglect, or suffer to sink into oblivion, similar writings of apostles,
   from whom they first received the gospel?

   Indeed, after all, this argument is merely hypothetical, and would be
   sufficient to answer the objections which might be made, if it could be
   proved, that some inspired writings had perished; but, in fact, there
   is no proof that any such ever existed. It is, therefore, highly
   probable, that we are in actual possession of all the books penned
   under the plenary inspiration of the Holy Spirit.

   The last remark which I shall make in relation to the books of the Old
   Testament supposed to be lost, is, that it is highly probable that we
   have several of them now in the Canon, under another name. The books of
   Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, were, probably, not written by one, but
   by a succession of prophets.

   There is reason to believe, that until the Canon of the Old Testament
   was closed, the succession of prophets was never interrupted. Whatever
   was necessary to be added, by way of explanation, to any book already
   received into the Canon, they were competent to annex; or, whatever
   annals or histories, it was the purpose of God to have transmitted to
   posterity, they would be directed and inspired to prepare. Thus,
   different parts of these books might have been penned by Gad, Nathan,
   Iddo, Shemaiah, &c.

   That some parts of these histories were prepared by prophets, we have
   clear proof, in one instance; for, Isaiah has inserted in his prophecy
   several chapters, which are contained in 2 Kings, and which, I think,
   there can be no doubt, were originally written by himself. See 2 Kings
   xviii. xix. xx., compared with Isaiah xxxvi. xxxvii. xxxviii.

   The Jewish doctors are of opinion, that the book of Jasher, is one of
   the books of the Pentateuch, or the whole law.

   The book of the Wars of the Lord has by many been supposed to be no
   other than the book of Numbers.

   Thus, I think, it sufficiently appears, from an examination of
   particulars, that there exists no evidence, that any canonical book of
   the Old Testament has been lost. To which we may add, that there are
   many general considerations of great weight, which go to prove, that no
   part of the Scriptures of the Old Testament has been lost.

   The first is, that God by his providence would preserve from
   destruction books given by inspiration, and intended for the perpetual
   instruction of his church. It is reasonable to think, that he would not
   suffer his gracious purpose to be frustrated; and this argument, a
   priori, is greatly strengthened by the fact, that a remarkable
   providential care has been exercised in the preservation of the Sacred
   Scriptures. It is truly wonderful, that so many books should have been
   preserved unmutilated, through hundreds and thousands of years; and
   during vicissitudes so great; and especially when powerful tyrants were
   so desirous of annihilating the religion of the Jews, and used their
   utmost exertions to destroy their sacred books.

   Another consideration of great weight is, the religious, and even
   scrupulous care, with which the Jews, as far as we can trace the
   history of the Sacred Scriptures, have watched over their preservation.
   There can, I think, be little doubt, that they exercised the same
   vigilance during that period of their history of which we have no
   monuments.

   The translation of these books into Greek, is sufficient to show, that
   the same books existed nearly three hundred years before the advent of
   Christ.

   And above all, the unqualified testimony to the Scriptures of the Old
   Testament, by Christ and his apostles, ought to satisfy us, that we
   have lost none of the inspired books of the Canon.

   The Scriptures are constantly referred to, and quoted as infallible
   authority, by them, as we have before shown. These oracles were
   committed to the Jews as a sacred deposit, and they are never charged
   with unfaithfulness in this trust. The Scriptures are declared to have
   been written for our learning; and no intimation is given that they had
   ever been mutilated, or in any degree corrupted.

SECTION VII.

  THE ORAL LAW OF THE JEWS WITHOUT FOUNDATION.

   HOWEVER the Jews may seem to agree with us, in regard to the Canon of
   the Old Testament, this concord relates only to the written law; for
   they obstinately persist in maintaining, that besides the law which was
   engraven on tables of stone, and the other precepts, and ordinances,
   which were communicated to Moses, and were ordered to be written, God
   gave unto him another Law, explanatory of the first, which he was
   commanded not to commit to writing, but to deliver down by oral
   tradition.

   The account which the Jewish doctors give of the first communication
   and subsequent delivery of this law, is found in the Talmud. It is
   there stated, that during the whole day, while Moses continued on the
   mount, he was learning the written law, but at night he was occupied in
   receiving the oral law.

   When Moses descended from the mount, they say, that he first called
   Aaron into his tent, and communicated to him all that he had learned of
   this oral law; then he placed him on his right hand. Next he called in
   Eliezer and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron, and repeated the whole to them;
   on which they also took their seats, the one on his right hand, the
   other on his left. After this the seventy elders entered, and received
   the same instruction as Aaron and his sons. And finally, the same
   communication was made to the whole multitude of people. Then Moses
   arose and departed, and Aaron, who had now heard the whole four times,
   repeated what he had learned, and also withdrew. In the same manner,
   Eliezer and Ithamar, each in turn, went over the same ground, and
   departed. And finally, the seventy elders repeated the whole to the
   people; every one of whom delivered what he had heard to his neighbour.
   Thus, according to Maimonides, was the oral law first given.

   The Jewish account of its transmission to posterity is no less
   particular. They pretend that Moses, when forty years had elapsed from
   the time of the Israelites leaving Egypt, called all the people, and
   telling them that his end drew near, requested that if any of them had
   forgotten aught of what he had delivered to them, they should repair to
   him, and he would repeat to them anew what they might have forgotten.
   And they tell us, that from the first day of the eleventh month, to the
   sixth day of the twelfth, he was occupied in nothing else than
   repeating and explaining the law to the people.

   But, in a special manner, he committed this law to Joshua, by whom it
   was communicated, shortly before his death, to Phineas, the son of
   Eliezer; by Phineas, to Eli; by Eli, to Samuel; by Samuel, to David and
   Ahijah; by Ahijah, to Elijah; by Elijah, to Elisha; by Elisha, to
   Jehoiada; by Jehoiada, to Zechariah; by Zechariah to Hosea; by Hosea,
   to Amos; by Amos, to Isaiah; by Isaiah, to Micah; by Micah, to Joel; by
   Joel, to Nahum; by Nahum, to Habakkuk; by Habakkuk, to Zephaniah; by
   Zephaniah, to Jeremiah; by Jeremiah, to Baruch; by Baruch, to Ezra, the
   president of the great synagogue. By Ezra, this law was delivered to
   the high priest Jaddua; by Jaddua, to Antigonus; by Antigonus, to
   Joseph son of John, and Joseph son of Jehezer; by these to Aristobulus,
   and Joshua the son of Perechiah; by them to Judah son of Tiboeus, and
   Simeon son of Satah. Thence to Shemaiah--to Hillel--to Simeon his son,
   supposed to have been the same who took our Saviour in his arms, in the
   temple, when brought thither to be presented by his parents. From
   Simeon, it passed to Gamaliel, the preceptor, as it is supposed, of
   Paul. Then to Simeon his son; and finally, to the son of Simeon, Judah
   Hakkadosh, by whom it was committed to writing.

   But, although, the above list brings down an unbroken succession, from
   Moses to Judah the Holy, yet to render the tradition still more
   certain, the Jewish doctors inform us, that this oral law was also
   committed, in a special manner, to the high priests, and handed down,
   through their line, until it was committed to writing.

   Judah Hakkadosh was the president of the Academy at Tiberias, and was
   held in great reputation for his sanctity, from which circumstance he
   received his surname, Hakkadosh the Holy. The temple being now
   desolate, and the nation scattered abroad, it was feared lest the
   traditionary law might be lost; therefore it was resolved to preserve
   it by committing it to writing. Judah the Holy, who lived about the
   middle of the second century, undertook this work, and digested all the
   traditions he could collect in six books, each consisting of several
   tracts. The whole number is sixty-three. But these tracts are again
   subdivided into numerous chapters. This is the famous Mishna of the
   Jews. When finished, it was received by the nation with the highest
   respect and confidence; and their doctors began, forthwith, to compose
   commentaries on every part of it, These comments are called the Gemara,
   or the Completion; and the Mishna and Gemara, together, form the
   Talmud. But as this work of commenting on the text of the Mishna was
   pursued, not only in Judea, but in Babylonia, where a large number of
   Jews resided, hence it came to pass, that two Talmuds were formed; the
   one called the Jerusalem Talmud, the other, the Babylonish Talmud. In
   both these, the Mishna, committed to writing by Judah, is the text; but
   the commentaries are widely different. The former was completed before
   the close of the third century of the Christian era; the latter was not
   completed until towards the close of the fifth century. The Babylonish
   Talmud is much the larger of the two; for while that of Jerusalem has
   been printed in one folio volume, this fills twelve folios. This last
   is also held in much higher esteem by the Jews than the other; and,
   indeed, it comprehends all the learning and religion of that people,
   since they have been cast off for their unbelief and rejection of the
   true Messiah.

   Maimonides has given an excellent digest of all the laws and
   institutions enjoined in this great work.

   The Jews place fully as much faith in the Talmud as they do in the
   Bible. Indeed, it is held in much greater esteem, and the reading of it
   is much more encouraged. It is a saying of one of their most esteemed
   Rabbies, "That the oral law is the foundation of the written; nor can
   the written law be expounded, but by the oral." Agreeably to this, in
   their confession, called the Golden Altar, it is said, "It is
   impossible for us to stand upon the foundation of our holy law, which
   is the written law, unless it be by the oral law, which is the
   exposition thereof." In the Talmud it is written, "That to give
   attention to the study of the Bible is some virtue; but he who pays
   attention to the study of the Mishna, possesses a virtue which shall
   receive a reward; and he who occupies himself in reading the Gemara,
   has a virtue, than which there is none more excellent." Nay, they go to
   the impious length of saying, "That he who is employed in the study of
   the Bible and nothing else, does but waste his time." They maintain,
   that if the declarations of this oral law be ever so inconsistent with
   reason and common sense, they must be received with implicit
   faith--"You must not depart from them," says Rabbi Solomon Jarchi, "if
   they should assert that your right hand is your left, or your left your
   right." And in the Talmud it is taught, "That, to sin against the words
   of the scribes, is far more grievous than to sin against the words of
   the Law." "My son, attend rather to the words of the scribes, than to
   the words of the Law." "The text of the Bible is like water, but the
   Mishna is like wine;" with many other similar comparisons.

   Without the oral law, they assert, that the written law remains in
   perfect darkness; for, say they, "There are many things in Scripture,
   which are contradictory, and which can in no way be reconciled, but by
   the oral law, which Moses received on Mount Sinai." In conformity with
   these sentiments, is the conduct of the Jews until this day. Their
   learned men spend almost all their time in poring over the Talmud; and
   he, among them, who knows most of the contents of this monstrous
   farrago of lies and nonsense, is esteemed the most learned man. In
   consequence of their implicit faith in this oral law, it becomes almost
   useless to reason with the Jews out of the Scriptures of the Old
   Testament. It is a matter of real importance, therefore, to show that
   this whole fabric rests on a sandy foundation; and to demonstrate that
   there is no evidence whatever that any such law was ever given to Moses
   on Sinai. To this subject, therefore, I would now solicit the attention
   of the reader.

   Here, then, let it be observed, that we have no controversy with the
   Jews concerning the written law, Moral, Ceremonial, or Political; nor
   do we deny that Moses received from God, on Mount Sinai, some
   explication of the written law. But what we maintain is, that this
   exposition did not form a second distinct law; that it was not the same
   as the oral law of the Jews, contained in the Talmud; that it was not
   received by Moses in a distinct form from the written law, and attended
   with a prohibition to commit it to writing.

   In support of these positions, we solicit the attention of the
   impartial reader to the following arguments:

   1. There is not the slightest mention of any such law in all the sacred
   records; neither of its original communication to Moses, nor of its
   transmission to posterity, in the way pretended by the Jews. Now, we
   ask, is it probable, that if such a law had been given, there should
   never have been any hint of the matter, nor the least reference to it,
   in the whole Bible? Certainly, this total silence of Scripture is very
   little favourable to the doctrine of an oral law. Maimonides does
   indeed pretend to find a reference to it in Exodus xxiv. 12. "I will
   give you, saith the Lord, a law and commandment;" by the first of these
   he understands the written law, and by the last the oral. But if he had
   only attended to the words next ensuing, he would never have adduced
   this text in confirmation of an oral law; "which I have written that
   thou mayst teach them." And we know that it is very common to express
   the written law by both these terms, as well as by several others of
   the same import. Now, if no record exists of such a law having been
   given to Moses, how can we, at this late period, be satisfied of the
   fact? If it was never heard of for more than two thousand years
   afterwards, what evidence is there that it ever existed?

   2. Again, we know that in the time of king Josiah, the written law,
   which had been lost, was found again. How great was the consternation
   of the pious king and his court, on this occasion! How memorable the
   history of this fact! But what became of the oral law during this
   period? Is it reasonable to think, that this would remain uninjured
   through successive ages of idolatry, when the written law was so
   entirely forgotten? If they had lost the knowledge of what was in their
   written law, would they be likely to retain that which was oral? If the
   written law was lost, would the traditionary law be preserved? And if
   this was at any time lost, how could it be recovered? Not from the
   written law, for this does not contain it; not from the memory of man,
   for the supposition is, that it was thence obliterated. If, then, this
   law, by any chance, was once lost, it is manifest that it could never
   be recovered, but by divine revelation. And when we survey the history
   of the Jews, is it conceivable, that such a body of law, as that
   contained in the Talmud, immensely larger than the written law, could
   have been preserved entire, through so many generations, merely by oral
   communication? The Jews, indeed, amuse us with a fable on this subject.
   They tell us that while the Israelites mourned on account of the death
   of Moses, they forgot three thousand of these traditions, which were
   recovered by the ingenuity of Othniel the son of Kenaz. This is
   ridiculous enough. What a heap of traditions must that have been, from
   which three thousand could be lost at once! And how profound the genius
   of Othniel, which was able to bring to light such a multitude of
   precepts, after they had been completely forgotten! But the proof of
   this fact is more ludicrous still. It is derived from Joshua xv. 16,
   17. "And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-Sepher, and taketh it, to
   him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. And Othniel the son of
   Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his
   daughter to wife." The unlearned reader should he informed that
   Kirjath-Sepher, means the city of the book.

   But who retained the oral law safely preserved in his memory during the
   long reign of Manasseh, and during the reign of Amon, and of Josiah?
   Where was that law, during the seventy years captivity in Babylon? Have
   we not a word to inform us of the fate of this law in all the histories
   of those times? What! is there not a hint concerning the preservation
   of a deposit so precious as this law is pretended to be? We must say
   again, that this continued silence of Scripture, through a period of so
   many hundred years, speaks little in favour of the unwritten law.

   3. The Jews again inform us, that this law was prohibited to be
   written; but whence do they derive the proof of the assertion? Let the
   evidence, if there be any, be produced. Must we have recourse to the
   oral law itself, for testimony? Be it so. But why then is it now
   written, and has been, for more than fifteen hundred years? In the
   Talmud, it is said, "The words of the written law, it is not lawful for
   you to commit to oral tradition; nor the words of the oral law to
   writing." And Sol. Jarchi says, "Neither is it lawful to write the oral
   law." Now we say, there was a law containing such a prohibition, or
   there was not. If the former, then the Talmudists have transgressed a
   positive precept of this law, in committing it to writing; if the
   latter, then their Talmud and their rabbies speak falsely. Let them
   choose in this dilemma.

   4. But it can be proved, that whatever laws Moses received from God,
   the same he was commanded to write. It is said, "And Moses came and
   told the people all the words of the Lord. And Moses wrote all the
   words of the Lord." Exod. xxiv. 3, 4.

   And again, it is said, "And the Lord said to Moses, Write these words,
   for according to these words have I made a covenant with you and with
   Israel." Exod. xxxiv. 27, 28. And it is worthy of particular
   observation, that whenever the people are called upon to obey the law
   of the Lord, no mention is made of any other than the written law. Thus
   Moses, when his end approached, made a speech unto the people; after
   which, it is added, "And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto
   the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
   Lord, and unto all the elders of Israel. And Moses commanded them
   saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year
   of release, in the feast of tabernacles, when all Israel is come to
   appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose,
   thou shalt read it before all Israel in their hearing." Deut. xxxi. 9,
   24.

   Here, observe, there is no mention of any other but the written law.
   There is no direction to repeat the oral law, at this time of leisure;
   but surely it was more necessary to command the people to do this, if
   there had been such a law, than to hear the written law which they
   might read from time to time.

   In the time of Ahaz, the sacred historian informs us, "That the Lord
   testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and
   by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my
   commandments and statutes, according to all the law which I commanded
   your fathers, and which I sent unto you by my servants the prophets." 2
   Kings xvii. 13, 37.

   Now, it is very manifest that the law which they are reproved for
   breaking, was the written law; for in the same chapter we have the
   following exhortation: "And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the
   law, and the commandments which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to
   do for evermore."

   The prophets continually refer the people "to the law and to the
   testimony," and declare, "if they speak not according to this word, it
   is because there is no light in them."

   When Jehoshaphat set about reforming and instructing the people, and
   set on foot an important mission, consisting of princes and Levites, to
   teach them, they confined themselves to what was written in the
   Scriptures, "And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of
   the Lord with them, and went about through all the cities of Judah, and
   taught the people." 2 Chron. xvii. 9.

   So also Ezra, when he instructed the people who had returned from
   Babylon, made use of no other than the written law; "And Ezra the
   priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women,
   and all that could hear with understanding. And he read therein before
   the street, that was before the water-gate, from the morning until
   mid-day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand:
   and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.
   And Ezra stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the
   purpose; and Ezra opened the book in sight of all the people, and when
   he opened it, all the people stood up. And the priests and the Levites
   caused the people to understand the law; and they read in the book, in
   the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused the people to
   understand the reading." Neh. viii. 2-5, 7, 8.

   5. Besides, the written law is pronounced to be perfect, so that
   nothing need, or could be added to it; therefore the oral law was
   superfluous. "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul."
   Psa. xix. 8. "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you,
   neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the
   commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you." Deut. iv. 1,
   2.

   It is not a valid objection which they bring against this argument,
   that Christians add the gospel to the law; for this is not, properly
   speaking, a new law. The gospel is a promise of grace and salvation.
   The precepts of the law are, indeed, specially employed in the gospel,
   to a purpose for which they were not originally intended; but the
   gospel, in whatever light it may be viewed, is committed to writing,
   and no part of it left to depend on oral tradition.

   6. In the numerous exhortations and injunctions of Almighty God,
   recorded in the Old Testament, there is not an instance of any one
   being commanded to do anything not contained in the written law, which
   proves, that either there was no other law in existence, or that
   obedience to it was not required; and if obedience was not required,
   then, certainly, there was no law. [31]

   Moreover, many of the Jews themselves concur with us in rejecting the
   oral law. The chief advocates of traditions were the Pharisees, who
   arose out of the schools of Hillel and Shammai, who lived after the
   times of the Maccabees. On this subject, we have the testimony of
   Jerome, who says, "Shammai and Hillel, from whom arose the Scribes and
   Pharisees, not long before the birth of Christ; the first of whom was
   called the Dissipator, and the last, Profane; because, by their
   traditions, they destroyed the law of God." Isai. viii. But on this
   point, the Sadducees were opposed to the Pharisees, and, according to
   Josephus, rejected all traditions, adhering to the Scriptures alone.
   With them agreed the Samaritans, and Essenes. The Karaites, also,
   received the written word, and rejected all traditions; although in
   other respects, they did not agree with the Sadducees. And in
   consequence of this, they are hated and reviled by the other Jews, so
   that it is not without great difficulty that they will receive a
   Karaite into one of their synagogues. Of this sect, there are still
   some remaining in Poland, Russia, Turkey, and Africa.

   It now remains to mention the arguments by which the Jews attempt to
   establish their oral law. These shall be taken from Manasseh ben
   Israel, [32] one of their most learned and liberal men. He argues from
   the necessity of an oral law, to explain many parts of the written law.
   To confirm this opinion, he adduces several examples, as Exodus xii. 2.
   "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months, it shall be the
   first month of the year." On this text he remarks, "That the name of
   the month is not mentioned. It is not said, whether the months were
   lunar or solar, both of which were in ancient use; and yet without
   knowing this, the precept could not be observed. The same difficulty
   occurs in regard to the other annual feasts."

   "Another example is taken from Lev. xi. 133, where it is commanded,
   that unclean birds shall not be eaten, and yet we are not furnished
   with any criteria, by which to distinguish the clean from the unclean,
   as in the case of beasts. A third example is from Exod. xvi. 29, Let no
   man go out of his place on the seventh day,' and yet we are not
   informed, whether he was forbidden to leave his house, his court, his
   city, or his suburbs. So, in Lev. xxi. 12, the priest is forbidden to
   go out of the Sanctuary,' and no time is limited; but we know that the
   residence of the priests was without the precincts of the temple, and
   that they served there in rotation."

   "Again, in Exod. xx. 100, all work is prohibited on the Sabbath, but
   circumcision is commanded to be performed on the eighth day; and it is
   nowhere declared, whether this rite should be deferred, when the eighth
   day occurred on the Sabbath. The same difficulty exists in regard to
   the slaying of the paschal lamb, which was confined by the law to the
   fourteenth day of the month, and we are nowhere informed what was to be
   done when this was the Sabbath." "In Deut. xxiv. we have many laws
   relating to marriage, but we are nowhere informed what was constituted
   a legal marriage." "In the Feast of the Tabernacles, beautiful branches
   of trees are directed to be used, but the species of tree is not
   mentioned. And in the Feast of Weeks, it is commanded, That on the
   fiftieth day, the wave-sheaf should be offered from their habitations;'
   but where it should be offered is not said. And, finally, among
   prohibited marriages, the wife of an uncle is never mentioned."

   In these, and many other instances, the learned Jew observes, that the
   law could only be understood by such oral tradition as he supposes
   accompanied the written law.

   Now, in answer to these things, we observe first, in the general, that
   however many difficulties may be started respecting the precise meaning
   of many parts of the law, these can never prove the existence of an
   oral law. The decision on these points might have been left to the
   discretion of the worshippers, or to the common sense of the people.
   Besides, many things may appear obscure to us, which were not so to the
   ancient Israelites; so that they might have needed no oral law to
   explain them.

   Again, it is one thing to expound a law, and another to add something
   to it; but the oral law for which they plead, is not a mere exposition,
   but an additional law.

   It is one thing to avail ourselves of traditions to interpret the law,
   and another to receive them as divine and absolutely necessary. We do
   not deny that many things may be performed according to ancient custom,
   or the traditions of preceding ages, in things indifferent; but we do
   deny that these can be considered as divine or necessary.

   But particularly, we answer, that the alleged difficulty about the name
   of the month has no existence, for it can be very well ascertained from
   the circumstances of the case; and in Exod. xiii. the month is named.
   The civil year of the Jews began with the month Tisri, but the
   ecclesiastical with Abib. There is, in fact, no greater difficulty
   here, than in any other case, where the circumstance of time is
   mentioned. There was no need of understanding the method of reducing
   solar and lunar years into one another, to decide this matter. And if
   the Talmud be examined on this point, where the oral law is supposed to
   be now contained, there will be found there no satisfactory method of
   computing time. And, indeed, the Talmudic doctors are so far from being
   agreed on this subject, that anything else may be found sooner than a
   law regulating this matter in the Talmud.

   And in regard to the unclean birds, why was it necessary to have
   criteria to distinguish them, since a catalogue of them is given in the
   very passage to which reference is made? And I would ask, does the
   pretended oral law contain any such criteria, to direct in this case?
   Nothing less. The difficulty about the people leaving their place on
   the Sabbath, and the priests leaving the temple, is really too trifling
   to require any serious consideration. And as to what should be done
   when the day of circumcising a child, or of killing the passover,
   happened on the Sabbath, it is a point easily decided. These positive
   institutions ought to have been observed, on whatever day they
   occurred.

   The question respecting matrimony should rather provoke a smile, than a
   serious answer; for who is ignorant what constitutes a lawful marriage?
   Or who would suppose that the ceremonies attendant on this transaction
   ought to be prescribed by the law of God; or, that another law was
   requisite for the purpose? As well might our learned Jew insist on the
   necessity of an oral law, to teach us how we should eat, drink, and
   perform our daily work.

   If the law prescribed beautiful branches of trees to be used in the
   Feast of Tabernacles, what need was there of an oral law to teach
   anything more? If such branches were used, it was of course indifferent
   whether they were of this or that species.

   Equally futile are the other arguments of the author, and need not be
   answered in detail.

   It appears, therefore, that there is no evidence that God ever gave any
   law to Moses, distinct from that which is written in the Pentateuch.
   And there is good reason to believe, that the various laws found in the
   Mishna, were never received from God, nor derived by tradition from
   Moses; but were traditions of the fathers, such as were in use in the
   time of our Saviour, who severely reprehends the Scribes and Pharisees,
   for setting aside, and rendering of no effect, the word of God, by
   their unauthorized traditions.

   The internal evidence is itself sufficient to convince us that the laws
   of the Talmud are human inventions, and not divine institutions; except
   that those circumstances of divine worship which were left to the
   discretion of the people, and which were regulated by custom, may be
   often found preserved in this immense work.

THE CANON OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.

     __________________________________________________________________

SECTION I.

  METHOD OF SETTLING THE CANON OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.

   AFTER what has been said, in the former part of this work, respecting
   the importance of settling the Canon on correct principles, it will be
   unnecessary to add anything here on that subject, except to say, that
   this inquiry cannot be less interesting in regard to the Old Testament
   than to the New. It is a subject which calls for our utmost diligence
   and impartiality. It is one which we cannot neglect with a good
   conscience; for the inquiry is nothing less than to ascertain what
   revelation God has made to us, and where it is to be found.

   As to the proper method of settling the Canon of the New Testament, the
   same course must be pursued as has been done in respect to the Old. We
   must have recourse to authentic history, and endeavour to ascertain
   what books were received as genuine by the primitive church and early
   Fathers. The contemporaries, and immediate successors of the apostles,
   are the most competent witnesses in this case. If, among these, there
   is found to have been a general agreement, as to what books were
   canonical, it will go far to satisfy us respecting the true Canon; for
   it cannot be supposed, that they could easily be deceived in a matter
   of this sort. A general consent of the early Fathers, and of the
   primitive church, therefore, furnishes conclusive evidence on this
   point, and is that species of evidence which is least liable to fallacy
   or abuse. The learned Huet, has, therefore, assumed it as a maxim,
   "That every book is genuine, which was esteemed genuine by those who
   lived nearest to the time when it was written, and by the ages
   following, in a continued series." [33] The reasonableness of this rule
   will appear more evident, when we consider the great esteem with which
   these books were at first received; the constant public reading of them
   in the churches, and the early version of them into other languages.

   The high claims of the Romish church, in regard to the authority of
   fixing the Canon, have already been disproved, as it relates to the
   books of the Old Testament; and the same arguments apply with their
   full force to the Canon of the New Testament, and need not be repeated.
   It may not be amiss, however, to hear from distinguished writers of
   that communion, what their real opinion is on this subject. Heuman
   asserts, "That the sacred Scriptures, without the authority of the
   church, have no more authority than Æsop's Fables." And Baillie, "That
   he would give no more credit to Matthew than to Livy, unless the church
   obliged him." To the same purpose speak Pighius, Eckius, Bellarmine,
   and many others of their most distinguished writers. By the authority
   of the church, they understand a power lodged in the church of Rome, to
   determine what books shall be received as the word of God; than which
   it is scarcely possible to conceive of anything more absurd.

   In avoiding this extreme, some Protestants have verged towards the
   opposite, and have asserted, that the only, or principal evidence of
   the canonical authority of the sacred Scriptures is, their internal
   evidence. Even some churches went so far as to insert this opinion in
   their public confessions. [34]

   Now it ought not to be doubted, that the internal evidence of the
   Scriptures is exceedingly strong; and that when the mind of the reader
   is truly illuminated, it derives from this source the most unwavering
   conviction of their truth and divine authority; but that every sincere
   Christian should be able, in all cases, by this internal light, to
   distinguish between canonical books and such as are not, is surely no
   very safe or reasonable opinion. Suppose that a thousand books of
   various kinds, including the canonical, were placed before any sincere
   Christian, would he be able, without mistake, to select from this mass
   the twenty-seven books of which the New Testament is composed, if he
   had nothing to guide him but the internal evidence? Would every such
   person be able at once to determine, whether the book of Ecclesiastes,
   or of Ecclesiasticus, belonged to the Canon of the Old Testament, by
   internal evidence alone? It is certain, that the influence of the Holy
   Spirit is necessary to produce a true faith in the word of God; but to
   make this the only criterion by which to judge of the canonical
   authority of a book is certainly liable to strong objections. The
   tendency of this doctrine is to enthusiasm, and the consequence of
   acting upon it, would be to unsettle, rather than establish, the Canon
   of Holy Scripture; for it would be strange, if some persons, without
   any other guidance than their own spiritual taste, would not pretend
   that other books besides those long received were canonical, or would
   not be disposed to reject some part of these. If this evidence were as
   infallible as some would have it to be, then the authenticity of every
   disputed text, as well as the canonical authority of every book, might
   be ascertained by it. But, it is a fact, that some eminently pious men
   doubted for a while respecting the canonical authority of some genuine
   books of the New Testament.

   And if the internal evidence were the only criterion of canonical
   authority to which we could resort, there would remain no possibility
   of convincing any person of the inspiration of a book, unless he could
   perceive in it the internal evidence of a divine origin. In many cases
   this species of evidence can scarcely be said to exist, as when for
   wise purposes God directs or inspires a prophet to record genealogical
   tables; or even in the narration of common events, I do not see how it
   can be determined from internal evidence, that the history is written
   by inspiration; for the only circumstance in which an inspired
   narrative differs from a faithful human history, is that the one is
   infallible, and the other is not; but the existence of this
   infallibility, or the absence of it, is not apparent from reading the
   books. Both accounts may appear consistent, and it is only, or chiefly,
   by external evidence that we can know that one of them is inspired. Who
   could undertake to say, that from internal evidence alone, he could
   determine that the book of Esther, or the Chronicles, were written by
   inspiration? Besides, some books are obscure and not easily understood;
   now, how could any one discern the internal evidence of a book, the
   meaning of which he did not yet understand?

   The evidence arising from a general view of the Scriptures,
   collectively, is most convincing, but is not so well adapted to
   determine whether some one book, considered separately, was certainly
   written by divine inspiration.

   It is necessary, therefore, to proceed to our destined point in a more
   circuitous way. We must be at the pains to examine into the history of
   the Canon, and, as was before said, to ascertain what books were
   esteemed canonical by all those who had the best opportunity of judging
   of this matter; and when the internal evidence is found corroborating
   the external, the two, combined, may produce a degree of conviction
   which leaves no room to desire any stronger evidence.

   The question to be decided is a matter of fact. It is an inquiry
   respecting the real authors of the books of the New Testament, whether
   they were written by the persons whose names they bear, or by others
   under their names. The inspiration of these books, though closely
   allied to this subject, is not now the object of inquiry. The proper
   method of determining a matter of fact, evidently is to have recourse
   to those persons who were witnesses of it, or who received their
   information from others who were witnesses. It is only in this way that
   we know that Iomer, Horace, Virgil, Livy, and Tully, wrote the books
   which now go under their names.

   The early Christians pursued this method of determining what books were
   canonical. They searched into the records of the church, before their
   time, and from these ascertained what books should be received, as
   belonging to the sacred volume. They appeal to that certain and
   universal tradition, which attested the genuineness of these books.
   Irenæus, Tertullian, Eusebius, Cyril, and Augustine, have all made use
   of this argument, in establishing the Canon of the New Testament.

   The question is often asked, When was the Canon of the New Testament
   constituted, and by what authority? Many persons who write and speak on
   this subject, appear to entertain a wrong impression in regard to it;
   as if the books of the New Testament could not be of authority, until
   they were sanctioned by some Ecclesiastical Council, or by some
   publicly expressed opinion of the Fathers of the church; and as if any
   portion of their authority depended on their being collected into one
   volume. But the truth is, that every one of these books was of
   authority, as far as known, from the moment of its publication; and its
   right to a place in the Canon, is not derived from the sanction of any
   church or council, but from the fact, that it was written by
   inspiration. And the appeal to testimony is not to prove that any
   council of bishops, or others, gave sanction to the book, but to show
   that it is indeed the genuine work of Matthew, or John, or Peter, or
   Paul, who we know were inspired.

   The books of the New Testament were, therefore, of full authority,
   before they were collected into one volume; and it would have made no
   difference if they had never been included in one volume, but had
   retained that separate form in which they were first published. And it
   is by no means certain, that these books were, at a very early period,
   bound in one volume. As far as we have any testimony on the subject,
   the probability is, that it was more customary to include them in two
   volumes: one of which was called the Gospel, and the other, the
   Apostles. Some of the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament extant,
   appear to have been put up in this form; and the Fathers often refer to
   the Scriptures of the New Testament, under these two titles. The
   question, When was the Canon constituted? admits therefore of no other
   proper answer than this,--that as soon as the last book of the New
   Testament was written and published, the Canon was completed. But if
   the question relates to the time when these books were collected
   together, and published in a single volume, or in two volumes, it
   admits of no definite answer; for those churches which were situated
   nearest to the place where any particular books were published, would,
   of course, obtain copies much earlier than churches in a remote part of
   the world. For a considerable period, the collection of these books, in
   each church, must have been necessarily incomplete; for it would take
   some time to send to the church, or people, with whom the autographs
   were deposited, and to have fair copies transcribed. This necessary
   process will also account for the fact, that some of the smaller books
   were not received by the churches so early, nor so universally, as the
   larger. The solicitude of the churches to possess immediately the more
   extensive and important books of the New Testament, would, doubtless,
   induce them to make a great exertion to acquire copies; but, probably,
   the smaller would not be so much spoken of,. nor would there be so
   strong a desire to obtain them, without delay. Considering how
   difficult it is now, with all our improvements in the typographical
   art, to multiply copies of the Scriptures with sufficient rapidity, it
   is truly wonderful, how so many churches as were founded during the
   first century, to say nothing of individuals, could all be supplied
   with copies of the New Testament, when there was no speedier method of
   producing them than by writing every letter with the pen! "The pen of a
   ready writer" must then, indeed, have been of immense value.

   The idea entertained by some, especially by Dodwell, that these books
   lay for a long time locked up in the coffers of the churches to which
   they were addressed, and totally unknown to the world, is in itself
   most improbable, and is repugnant to all the testimony which exists on
   the subject. Even as early as the time when Peter wrote his second
   Epistle, the writings of Paul were in the hands of the churches, and
   were classed with the other Scriptures. [35] And the citations from
   these books by the earliest Christian writers, living in different
   countries, demonstrate, that from the time of their publication, they
   were sought after with avidity, and were widely dispersed. How intense
   the interest which the first Christians felt in the writings of the
   apostles can scarcely be conceived by us, who have been familiar with
   these books from our earliest years. How solicitous would they be, for
   example, who had never seen Paul, but had heard of his wonderful
   conversion, and extraordinary labours and gifts, to read his writings!
   And probably they who had enjoyed the high privilege of hearing this
   apostle preach, would not be less desirous of reading his Epistles. As
   we know, from the nature of the case, as well as from testimony, that
   many uncertain accounts of Christ's discourses and miracles had
   obtained circulation, how greatly would the primitive Christians
   rejoice to obtain an authentic history from the pen of an apostle, or
   from one who wrote precisely what was dictated by an apostle! We need
   no longer wonder, therefore, that every church should wish to possess a
   collection of the writings of the apostles; and knowing them to be the
   productions of inspired men, they would want no further sanction of
   their authority. All that was requisite was, to be certain that the
   book was indeed written by the apostle whose name it bore. And this
   leads me to observe, that some things in Paul's Epistles, which seem to
   common readers to be of no importance, were of the utmost consequence.
   Such as, "I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle," &c.--"The salutation,
   with mine own hand."--"So I write in every epistle."--"You see how
   large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand."--"The
   salutation by the hand of me, Paul."--"The salutation of Paul with mine
   own hand, which is the token in every Epistle." [36] This apostle
   commonly employed an amanuensis; but that the churches to which he
   wrote might have the assurance of the genuineness of his Epistles, from
   seeing his own hand-writing, he constantly wrote the salutation
   himself; so much care was taken to have these sacred writings well
   authenticated, on their first publication. And on the same account it
   was, that he and the other apostles were so particular in giving the
   names, and the characters, of those who were the bearers of their
   Epistles. And it seems, that they were always committed to the care of
   men of high estimation in the church; and commonly, more than one
   appears to have been intrusted with this important commission.

   If it be inquired, what became of the autographs of these sacred books,
   and why they were not preserved; since this would have prevented all
   uncertainty respecting the true reading, and would have relieved the
   Biblical critic from a large share of labour; it is sufficient to
   answer, that nothing different has occurred, in relation to these
   autographs, from that which has happened to all other ancient writings.
   No man can produce the autograph of any book as old as the New
   Testament, unless it has been preserved in some extraordinary way, as
   in the case of the manuscripts of Herculaneum; neither could it be
   supposed, that in the midst of such vicissitudes, revolutions, and
   persecutions, as the Christian church endured, this object could have
   been secured by anything short of a miracle. And God knew, that by a
   superintending providence over the sacred Scriptures, they could be
   transmitted with sufficient accuracy, by means of apographs, to the
   most distant generations. Indeed, there is reason to believe, that the
   Christians of early times were so absorbed and impressed with the glory
   of the truths revealed, that they gave themselves little concern about
   the mere vehicle by which they were communicated. They had matters of
   such deep interest, and so novel, before their eyes, that they had
   neither time, nor inclination, for the minutiae of criticism. It may
   be, therefore, that they did not set so high a value on the possession
   of the autograph of an inspired book as we should, but considered a
   copy, made with scrupulous fidelity, as equally valuable with the
   original. And God may have suffered these autographs of the sacred
   writings to perish, lest in process of time, they should have become
   idolized, like the brazen serpent; or lest men should be led
   superstitiously to venerate the mere parchment and ink, and form and
   letters, employed by an apostle. Certainly, the history of the church
   renders such an idea far from being improbable.

   But, although little is said about the originals of the apostles'
   writings, we have a testimony in Tertullian, that the Authentic Letters
   of the apostles might be seen by any that would take the pains to go to
   the churches to which they were addressed. Some, indeed, think that
   Tertullian does not mean to refer to the autographs, but to authentic
   copies; but why then send the inquirer to the churches to which the
   Epistles were addressed? Had not other churches, all over the world,
   authentic copies of these Epistles also? There seems to be good reason,
   therefore, for believing, that the autographs, or original letters of
   the apostles, were preserved by the churches to which they were
   addressed, in the time of Tertullian. [37]

   But although the autographs of the books of the New Testament are not
   extant, we have beautiful copies of the whole penned as early as the
   fourth or fifth century, and some think that our oldest manuscripts of
   the New Testament have a still earlier origin; and we have versions
   which were made at a period still earlier, so that we have lost nothing
   by the disappearance of the autographs of the New Testament.

SECTION II.

   CATALOGUES OF THE BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT--CANONICAL BOOKS ALONE
   CITED AS AUTHORITY BY THE FATHERS, AND READ IN THE CHURCHES AS
   SCRIPTURE.

   HAVING declared our purpose, to place the settling of the Canon of the
   New Testament on the footing of authentic testimony, we will now
   proceed to adduce our authorities, and shall begin with an examination
   of the ancient catalogues of the New Testament.

   The slightest attention to the works of the Fathers will convince any
   one that the writings of the apostles were held, from the beginning, in
   the highest estimation; that great pains were taken to distinguish the
   genuine productions of these inspired men from all other books; that
   they were sought out with uncommon diligence, and read with profound
   attention and veneration, not only in private, but publicly in the
   churches; and that they are cited and referred to, universally, as
   decisive on every point of doctrine, and as authoritative standards for
   the regulation of faith and practice.

   This being the state of the case, when the books of the New Testament
   were communicated to the churches, we are enabled, in regard to most of
   them, to produce testimony of the most satisfactory kind, that they
   were admitted into the Canon, and received as inspired, by the
   universal consent of Christians in every part of the world. And as to
   those few books, concerning which some persons entertained doubts, it
   can be shown, that as soon as their claims were fully and impartially
   investigated, they also were received with universal consent; and that
   other books, however excellent as human compositions, were never put
   upon a level with the canonical books of the New Testament; that
   spurious writings, under the names of the apostles, were promptly and
   decisively rejected, and that the churches were repeatedly warned
   against such apocryphal books.

   To do justice to this subject, will require some detail, which may
   appear dry to the reader, but should be interesting to every person who
   wishes to know assuredly, that what he receives as sacred Scripture, is
   no imposture, but the genuine, authentic productions of those inspired
   men, whom Christ appointed to be his witnesses to the world, and to
   whom was committed the sacred deposit of divine truth, intended for the
   instruction and government of the church in all future ages.

   In exhibiting the evidence of the canonical authority of these books,
   we shall first attend to some general considerations, which relate to
   the whole volume, and then adduce testimony in favour of each book now
   included in the Canon. And here, as in the case of the Old Testament,
   we find that at a very early period, catalogues of these books were
   published, by most of the distinguished Fathers whose writings have
   come down to us; and that the same has been done, also, by several
   councils, whose decrees are still extant.

   These catalogues are, for the most part, perfectly harmonious. In a few
   of them, some books now ir the Canon are omitted, for which omission a
   satisfactory reason can commonly be assigned. In the first circulation
   of the sacred Scriptures, there was great need of such lists; as the
   distant churches and common Christians were liable to be imposed on by
   spurious writings, which seem to have abounded in those times. It was,
   therefore, a most important part of the instruction given to
   Christians, by their spiritual guides, to inform them accurately, what
   books belonged to the Canon. Great pains were taken, also, to know the
   truth on this subject. Pious bishops, for this single purpose,
   travelled into Judea, and remained there for some time, that they might
   learn, accurately, every circumstance relative to the authenticity of
   these writings.

   1. The first regular catalogue of the books of the New Testament, which
   we find on record, is by Origen, whose extensive Biblical knowledge
   highly qualified him to judge correctly in this case. He had not only
   read much, but travelled extensively, and resided a great part of his
   life on the confines of Judea, in a situation favourable to accurate
   information from every part of the church, where any of these books
   were originally published. Origen lived and flourished about one
   hundred years after the death of the apostle John. He was, therefore,
   near enough to the time of the publication of these books, to obtain
   the most certain information of their authors. Most of the original
   writings of this great and learned man have perished, but his catalogue
   of the books of the New Testament has been preserved by Eusebius, in
   his Ecclesiastical History. [38] It was contained in Origen's Homilies
   on the gospel of Matthew; and was repeated in his Homilies on the
   gospel of John.

   In this catalogue he mentions the four Gospels, the Acts of the
   Apostles, fourteen Epistles of Paul, two of Peter, three of John, and
   the Book of Revelation. This enumeration includes all the present
   Canon, except the Epistles of James and Jude, but these were omitted by
   accident, not design; for in other parts of his writings, he
   acknowledges these Epistles as a part of the Canon. And while Origen
   furnishes us with so full a catalogue of the books now in the Canon, he
   inserts no others, which proves, that in his time the Canon was well
   settled among the learned; and that the distinction between inspired
   writings and human compositions was as clearly marked, as at any
   subsequent period.

   In the work entitled, Apostolical Constitutions, ascribed to Clement of
   Rome, there is a catalogue of the books of the New Testament; but as
   this work is not genuine, and of an uncertain author and age, I will
   not make use of it.

   There has been preserved a fragment of a very ancient writing on the
   Canon, ascribed to Caius the presbyter, which may be seen in Routh's
   Reliquiæ, an abridgment of which is here given in a literal version
   from the Latin. What is said by the author concerning the first two
   evangelists is lost. The fragment commences by saying, "The third is
   the gospel according to Luke. Luke was that physician who, after the
   ascension, consorted with Paul. . . . . Although he had never seen
   Christ in the flesh, yet having acquired a knowledge of his life, he
   commences his narrative from the nativity of John.

   "The fourth gospel was written by John, one of the disciples. To his
   fellow disciples, and to the bishops, who exhorted him [to write,] he
   said, Fast with me three days, from this day, and whatever shall be
   revealed to any of us, we will declare to one another.' The same night
   it was revealed to Andrew, that John, under his own name should
   describe all things, so that they might be recognized by all. And so,
   though various elements are taught in the several gospels, yet the
   faith of believers is not diverse, since with one pervading spirit all
   things are declared by all concerning the nativity, the passover, the
   resurrection, and concerning his conversation with his disciples, and
   his double advent; the first, when he was seen in a state of
   humiliation . . . . . . in the second, with glorious regal power, which
   is yet future. . . . But the Acts of all the Apostles, Luke to
   Theophilus has comprehended in a single book. The Epistles of Paul
   declare to all who wish to know, on what account, and from what place
   they were written. Paul, following the example of his predecessor John,
   wrote Epistles to the following seven named churches:--First, to the
   Corinthianss; the second to the Ephesians; the third to the
   Philpipians; the fourth to the Colossians; the fifth to the Galatians;
   the sixth to the Thessalonians; and the seventh to the Romans. But to
   the Corinthians and the Thessalonians, he wrote, for the sake of
   correction, a second time. One church is known, diffused through the
   whole world.

   "And John, in the Apocalypse, although he addressed himself to seven
   churches, yet speaks to all. Moreover, there is one [epistle] to
   Philemonn; one to Titus, and two to Timothy, on account of his
   affection and care; which, however, are in honour of the Catholic
   Church, and sanctified to the ordaining ecclesiastical discipline.

   "There is one [epistle of Paul] carried about to the Laodiceans, and
   one to the Alexandrians under the name of Paul, forged to support the
   heresy of Marcion, and many others which ought not to be received into
   the Catholic Church. For it is unsuitable that gall should be mixed
   with honey. Indeed, the Epistle of Jude and two [smaller epistles]
   under the name of John are in the possession of the church. Also the
   book of Wisdomm, written by the friends of Solomon in honour of him.
   There is an Apocalypse of John, and one of Peter; the church receives
   only the former, and some are unwilling that this should be read in the
   church."

   From this ancient fragment of the second century, we have nearly a
   complete catalogue of the canonical books of the New Testament, and the
   rejection of some spurious books which, even at that early age, were
   put into circulation. This fragment is not noticed by Lardner. It was
   discovered by Muratorius, and has been largely commented on by several
   learned authors. Muratorius ascribes it to the presbyter Caius; but
   others to Papias. Routh considers it altogether uncertain who is the
   author; but all agree in referring it to the second century.

   The catalogue ascribed to the Council of Nice, is not genuine, and is
   connected with a story which bears every mark of superstitious
   credulity. [39] This, therefore, shall be likewise omitted. We stand in
   no need of suspicious testimony on this subject. Witnesses of the most
   undoubted veracity, and distinguished intelligence, can be found in
   every successive age.

   2. The next catalogue of the books of the New Testament to which I will
   refer, is that of Eusebius, the learned historian of the church; to
   whose diligence and fidelity, in collecting ecclesiastical facts, we
   are more indebted, than to the labours of all other men, for that
   period which intervened between the days of the apostles and his own
   times. Eusebius may be considered as giving his testimony about one
   hundred years after Origen. His catalogue may be seen in his
   Ecclesiastical History. [40] In it, he enumerates every book which we
   have now in the Canon, and no others; but he mentions that the Epistle
   of James, the second of Peter, and second and third of John, were
   doubted of by some; and that the Revelation was rejected by some, and
   received by others; but Eusebius himself declares it to be his opinion,
   that it should be received without doubt.

   There is no single witness among the whole number of ecclesiastical
   writers, who was more competent to give accurate information on this
   subject than Eusebius. He had spent a great part of his life in
   searching into the antiquities of the Christian church; and he had an
   intimate acquaintance with all the records relating to the
   ecclesiastical affairs, many of which are now lost; and almost the only
   information which we have of them has been transmitted to us by this
   diligent compiler. (See Appendix Note D. )

   3. Athanasius, so well known for his writings and his sufferings in
   defence of the divinity of our Saviour, in his Festal Epistle, and in
   his Synopsis of Scripture, has left a catalogue of the books of the New
   Testament, which perfectly agrees with the Canon now in use.

   4. Cyril, in his Catechetical work, has also given us a catalogue,
   perfectly agreeing with ours, except that he omits the book of
   Revelation. Why that book was so often left out of the ancient
   catalogues and collections of the Scriptures, shall be mentioned
   hereafter. Athanasius and Cyril were contemporary with Eusebius; the
   latter, however, may more properly be considered as twenty or thirty
   years later.

   5. Then, a little after the middle of the fourth century, we have the
   testimony of all the bishops assembled in the Council of Laodicea. The
   catalogue of this council is contained in their sixtieth Canon, and is
   exactly the same as ours, except that the book of Revelation is
   omitted. The decrees of this council were, in a short time, received
   into the Canons of the universal church; and among the rest, this
   catalogue of the books of the New Testament. Thus, we find, that as
   early as the middle of the fourth century, there was a universal
   consent, in all parts of the world to which the Christian church
   extended, as to the books which constituted the Canon of the New
   Testament, with the single exception of the book of Revelation; and
   that this book was also generally admitted to be canonical, we shall
   take the opportunity of proving in the sequel of this work.

   6. But a few years elapsed from the meeting of this council, before
   Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis, in the island of Cyprus, published his
   work "on Heresies," in which he gives a catalogue of the canonical
   books of the New Testament, which, in every respect, is the same as the
   Canon now received.

   7. About the same time, Gregory Nazianzen, bishop of Constantinople, in
   a Poem, "on the True and Genuine Scriptures," mentions distinctly all
   the books now received, except Revelation.

   8. A few years later, we have a list of the books of the New Testament
   in a work of Philastrius, bishop of Brixia, in Italy, which corresponds
   in all respects with those now received; except that he mentions no
   more than thirteen of Paul's Epistles. If the omission was designed, it
   probably relates to the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   9. At the same time lived Jerome, who translated the whole Bible into
   Latin. He furnishes us with a catalogue answering to our present Canon,
   in all respects. He does, however, speak doubtfully about the Epistle
   to the Hebrews, on account of the uncertainty of its author. But, in
   other parts of his writings, he shows, that he received this book as
   canonical, as well as the rest. [41]

   10. The catalogue of Rufin varies in nothing from the Canon now
   received. [42]

   11. Augustine, in his work on "Christian Doctrine," has inserted the
   names of the books of the New Testament, which, in all respects, are
   the same as ours.

   12. The Council of Carthage, at which Augustine was present, have
   furnished a catalogue which perfectly agrees with ours. At this
   council, forty-four bishops attended. The list referred to, is found in
   their forty-eighth Canon.

   13. The unknown author, who goes under the name of Dionysisus the
   Areopagite, so describes the books of the New Testament, as to show
   that he received the very same as are now in the Canon.

   Another satisfactory source of evidence, in favour of the Canon of the
   New Testament, as now received, is the fact, that these books were
   quoted as sacred Scripture by all the Fathers, living in parts of the
   world the most remote from each other. The truth of this assertion will
   fully appear, when we come to speak particularly of the books which
   compose the Canon. Now, how can it be accounted for, that these books,
   and these alone, should be cited as authority in Asia, Africa and
   Europe? No other reason can be assigned, than one of these two; either,
   they knew no other books which claimed to be canonical; or, if they
   did, they did not esteem them of equal authority with those which they
   cited. On either of these grounds the conclusion is the same, that the
   books quoted as Scripture are alone the canonical books. To apply this
   rule to a particular case--"the first Epistle of Peter" is canonical,
   because it is continually cited by the most ancient Christian writers,
   in every part of the world; but the book called "The Revelation of
   Peter," is apocryphal, because none of the early Fathers have taken any
   testimonies from it. The same is true of "the Acts of Peter," and "the
   Gospel of Peter." These writings were totally unknown to the primitive
   church, and are therefore spurious. This argument is perfectly
   conclusive, and its force was perceived by the ancient defenders of the
   Canon of the New Testament. Eusebius repeatedly has recourse to it,
   and, therefore, those persons who have aimed to unsettle our present
   Canon, as Toland and Dodwell, have attempted to prove that the early
   Christian writers were in the habit of quoting indifferently, and
   promiscuously, the books which we now receive, and others which are now
   rejected as apocryphal. But this is not correct, as has been shown by
   Nye, Richardsonn, and others. The true method of determining this
   matter, is by a careful examination of all the passages in the writings
   of the Fathers, where other books besides those now in the Canon have
   been quoted. Some progress was made in collecting the passages in the
   writings of the Fathers, in which any reference is made to the
   apocryphal books, by the learned Jeremiah Jones, in his "New Method of
   settling the Canon of the New Testament," but the work was left
   incomplete. This author, however, positively denies that it is common
   for the Fathers to cite these books as Scripture, and asserts, that
   there are only a very few instances, in which any of them seem to have
   fallen into this mistake.

   A third proof of the genuineness of the Canon of the New Testament, may
   be derived from the fact, that these books were publicly read as
   Scripture, in all the Christian churches.

   As the Jews were accustomed to read the sacred Scriptures of the Old
   Testament in their Synagogues, so the early Christians transferred the
   same practice to the church; and it seems to have been in use even in
   the apostles' days, as appears by Col. iv. 16, where Paul speaks of
   reading the Epistles addressed to the churches, as a thing of course, "
   And when this Epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in
   the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the Epistle
   from Laodicea."

   Justin Martyr explicitly testifies, that this was the custom in the
   beginning of the second century. "On the day," says he, "which is
   called Sunday, there is a meeting of all (Christians) who live either
   in cities, or country places, and the memoirs of the apostles, and
   writings of the prophets, are read." [43]

   Tertullian is equally explicit; for, in giving an account of the
   meetings of Christians for worship, he says, "They assemble to read the
   Scriptures, and offer up prayers;" and in another place, among the
   solemn exercises of the Lord's Day, he reckons, "Reading the
   Scriptures, singing Psalms," &c. [44]

   The same account is given by Cyprian, [45] and by the ancient author
   under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite; [46] and by several other
   ancient authors. Now this practice of reading the sacred Scriptures in
   the Christian churches, began so early that it is scarcely possible
   that they could have been imposed on by supposititious writings. A more
   effectual method of guarding against apocryphal writings obtaining a
   place in the Canon, could not have been devised. It afforded all the
   members of the church an opportunity of knowing what books were
   acknowledged as canonical, and precluded all opportunity of foisting in
   spurious works; since, if this had been done in some one church, the
   practice of all other churches would quickly have exposed the
   imposture. Accordingly, the Fathers often referred to this custom, as
   the guide to the people, respecting the books which they should read.
   "Avoid apocryphal books," says Cyril to his catechumen, "and study
   carefully those Scriptures only which are publicly read in the church."
   Again, having given a catalogue of the books of Scripture, he adds:
   "Let others be rejected; and such as are not read in the churches,
   neither do you read in private."

   It was decreed in the Council of Laodicea, "That no private Psalms
   should be read in the churches, nor any books without the Canon; but
   only the canonical writings of the Old and New Testament." The same
   thing was determined in the Council of Carthage. But notwithstanding
   these decrees, and the opinions of learned Fathers, there were some
   pieces read in some of the churches which were not canonical. Thus,
   Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, in the second century, in a letter to the
   church of Rome, tells them, "That they read in their assemblies, on the
   Lord's day, Clement's Epistle." And Eusebius declares, "That in his,
   and the preceding times, it was almost universally received, and read
   in most churches." He says also, "That the Shepherd of Hermas was read
   in many churches," which is confirmed by Athanasius and Rufin. Whilst
   these books, which are not now in the Canon, were publicly read in many
   churches, the book of Revelation was not, according to Cyril, read in
   the churches; nor commanded to be read by the Council of Laodicea. It
   would seem, therefore, at first view, that the application of this rule
   would exclude the book of Revelation from the Canon, and take in "the
   Epistle of Clement," and "the Shepherd of Hermas." But the rule does
   not apply to everything which was read in the churches, but to such
   books as were read as sacred Scripture. It has appeared in a former
   part of this work, that several books, not in the Canon of the Old
   Testament, were nevertheless read in the churches; but the Fathers
   carefully distinguished between these and the canonical books. They
   were read for instruction and for the improvement of manners, but not
   as authority in matters of faith. They distinguished the books read, in
   the churches, into Canonical and Ecclesiastical; of the latter kind,
   were the books mentioned above, and some others. The reason why the
   book of Revelation was not directed to be read publicly, shall be
   assigned, when we come to treat particularly of the canonical authority
   of that book.

   A fourth argument to prove that our Canon of the New Testament is
   substantially correct, may be derived from the early versions of this
   sacred book into other languages.

   Although the Greek language was extensively known through the Roman
   empire, when the apostles wrote, yet the Christian church was in a
   short time extended into regions, where the common people, at least,
   were not acquainted with it, nor with any language except their own
   vernacular tongue. While the gift of tongues continued, the difficulty
   of making known the Gospel, would in some measure be obviated; but when
   these miraculous powers ceased, the necessity of a version of the
   Gospels and Epistles into the language of the people would become
   manifest. As far, therefore, as we may be permitted to reason from the
   nature of the case, and the necessities of the churches, it is
   exceedingly probable, that versions of the New Testament were made
   shortly after the death of the apostles, if they were not begun before.
   Can we suppose that the numerous Christians in Syria, Mesopotamia, and
   the various parts of Italy, would be long left without having these
   precious books translated into a language which all the people could
   understand? But we are not left to our own reasonings on this subject.
   We know, that at a very early period, there existed Latin versions of
   the New Testament, which had been so long in use before the time of
   Jerome, as to have become considerably corrupt, on which account he
   undertook a new version, which soon superseded those that were more
   ancient. Now, although nothing remains of these ancient Latin versions,
   but uncertain fragments, yet we have good evidence that they contained
   the same books, as were inserted in Jerome's version, now denominated
   the Vulgate.

   But, perhaps, the Old Syriac version of the New Testament, called
   Peshito, furnishes the strongest proof of the canonical authority of
   all the books which are contained in it. This excellent version has a
   very high claim to antiquity; and, in the opinion of some of the best
   Syriac scholars, who have profoundly examined this subject, was made
   before the close of the first century.

   The arguments for so early an origin, are not, indeed, conclusive, but
   they possess much probability, whether we consider the external, or
   internal evidence. The Syrian Christians have always insisted that this
   version was made by the apostle Thaddeus; but without admitting this
   claim, which would put it on a level with the Greek original, we may
   believe that it ought not to be brought down lower than the second
   century. It is universally received by all the numerous sects of Syrian
   Christians, and must be anterior to the existence of the oldest of
   them. Manes, who lived in the second century, probably had read the New
   Testament in the Syriac, which was his native tongue; and Justin
   Martyr, when he testifies that the Scriptures of the New Testament were
   read in the Assemblies of Christians, on every Sunday, probably refers
   to Syrian Christians, as Syria was his native place; where, also, he
   had his usual residence. And Michaelis is of opinion, that Melito, who
   wrote about A. D. 170, has expressly declared, that a Syrian version of
   the Bible existed in his time. Jerome also testifies, explicitly, that
   when he wrote, the Syriac Bible was publicly read in the churches; for,
   says he, "Ephrem the Syrian is held in such veneration, that his
   writings are read in several churches, immediately after the Lessons
   from the Bible. It is also well known that the Armenian version, which
   itself is ancient, was made from the Syriac.

   Now, this ancient version contains the Four Gospels, the Acts of the
   Apostles, the Epistles of Paul including that to the Hebrews, the First
   Epistle of John, the First Epistle of Peter, and the Epistle of James.
   Thus far, then, the evidence of the present Canon is complete; and as
   to those books omitted in this version, except Revelation, they are
   few, and small, and probably were unknown to the translator or the
   evidence of their genuineness was not ascertained by him. And as it
   relates to the book of Revelation, the same reasons which excluded it
   from so many ancient catalogues, probably operated here. It was judged
   to be too mysterious to be read in the churches, and by common
   Christians, and, therefore, was not put into the volume which was read
   publicly in the churches. The arguments for a Latin origin of this
   version possess, in my judgment, very little force. [47]

   On the general evidence of the genuineness of our Canon, I would
   subjoin the following remarks:

   1. The agreement among those who have given catalogues of the books of
   the New Testament, from the earliest times, is almost complete. Of
   thirteen catalogues, to which we have referred, seven contain exactly
   the same books, as are now in the Canon. Three of the others differ in
   nothing but the omission of the book of Revelation, for which they had
   a particular reason, consistent with their belief of its canonical
   authority; and in two of the remaining catalogues, it can be proved,
   that the books omitted, or represented as doubtful, were received as
   authentic by the persons who have furnished the catalogues. It may be
   asserted, therefore, that the consent of the ancient church, as to what
   books belonged to the Canon of the New Testament, was complete. The
   sacred volume was as accurately formed, and as clearly distinguished
   from other books, in the third, fourth, and fifth centuries, as it has
   ever been since.

   2. Let it be considered, moreover, that the earliest of these
   catalogues was made by Origen, who lived within a hundred years after
   the death of the apostle John, and who, by his reading, travels, and
   long residence in Palestine, had a full knowledge of all the
   transactions and writings of the church, until his own time. In
   connection with this, let it be remembered, that these catalogues were
   drawn up by the most learned, pious, and distinguished men in the
   church; or by councils; and that the persons furnishing them resided in
   different and remote parts of the world. As, for example, in Jerusalem,
   Cesaræa, Carthage and Hippo in Africa, Constantinople, Cyprus,
   Alexandria in Egypt, Italy, and Asia Minor. Thus, it appears, that the
   Canon was early agreed upon, and that it was everywhere the same;
   therefore, we find the Fathers, in all their writings, appealing to the
   same Scriptures; and none are charged with rejecting any canonical
   book, except heretics.

   3. It appears from the testimony adduced, that it was never considered
   necessary, that any council, or bishop, should give sanction to these
   books, in any other way, than as witnesses, testifying to the churches,
   that these were indeed the genuine writings of the apostles. These
   books, therefore, were never considered as deriving their authority
   from the Church, or from Councils, but were of complete authority as
   soon as published; and were delivered to the churches to be a guide and
   standard in all things relating to faith and practice. The Fathers
   would have considered it impious, for any bishop or Council, to pretend
   to add anything to the authority of inspired books; or to claim the
   right to add other books to those handed down from the apostles. The
   church is founded on "the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ being the
   chief corner stone;" but the sacred Scriptures are noway dependent for
   their authority on any set of men who lived since they were written.

   4. We may remark, in the last place, the benignant providence of God
   towards his church, in causing these precious books to be written, and
   in watching over their preservation, in the midst of dangers and
   persecutions; so that, notwithstanding the malignant designs of the
   enemies of the church, they have all come down to us unmutilated, in
   the original tongue in which they were penned by the apostles.

   Our liveliest gratitude is due to the great Head of the church for this
   divine treasure, from which we are permitted freely to draw whatever is
   needful for our instruction and consolation. And it is our duty to
   prize this precious gift of divine revelation above all price. On the
   Law of the Lord, we should meditate day and night. It is a perfect
   rule; it shines with a clear light; it exercises a salutary influence
   on the heart; it warns us when we are in danger, reclaims us when we go
   astray, and comforts us when in affliction. The word of the Lord is
   "more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also
   than honey, and the honey-comb." Psa. xix. 10. They who are destitute
   of this inestimable volume call for our tenderest compassion, and our
   exertions in circulating the Bible should never be remitted, until all
   are supplied with this divine treasure. But they who possess this
   sacred volume, and yet neglect to study it, are still more to be
   pitied, for they are perishing in the midst of plenty. In the midst of
   light, they walk in darkness. God has sent to them the word of life,
   but they have lightly esteemed the rich gift of his love. O that their
   eyes were opened, that they might behold wondrous things in the law of
   the Lord!

   [39] The story is briefly this. The Fathers of the Council of Nice put
   all the books which claimed a place in the sacred Canon under the
   communion table of the church, and then prayed that such of them as
   were inspired might be found uppermost, and the apocryphal below;
   whereupon, the event occurred agreeably to their wishes; and thus a
   clear line of distinction was made between canonical books and such as
   were not canonical. This story is related in the Synodicon of Popus, an
   obscure writer, and is undeserving of the smallest credit.

SECTION III.

   ORDER OF THE BOOKS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT--TIME OF THE GOSPELS BEING
   WRITTEN--NOTICE OF THE EVANGELISTS.

   THE order of the books of the New Testament is not uniform, in the
   manuscripts now extant, nor as they are mentioned by the Fathers.
   Eusebius arranges them thus: the Four Gospels, the Acts of the
   Apostles, the Epistles of Paul, the First Epistle of John, and the
   Revelation of John. "These," says he, "were received (except the last
   mentioned) by all Christians." Then, he mentions those which were not
   unanimously received; as, the Epistle of James, the Epistle of Jude,
   the Second of Peter, and the Second and Third of John.

   Irenæus, who lived long before Eusebius, has not given a regular
   catalogue of the books of the New Testament, but he seems to have
   followed the same order.

   But Athanasius, in his Festal Epistle, has given the following order:
   The Four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the Seven Catholic
   Epistles, the Fourteen Epistles of Paul, and the Revelation. The
   ancient and celebrated Alexandrian Manuscript follows the same order;
   as also does Cyril of Jerusalem, but he does not mention Revelation.

   The arrangement, in the catalogue of the Council of Laodicea, is
   exactly the same as that of Cyril; the book of Revelation being left
   out. John Damascene, and Leontius, follow the same order.

   The order of the Syrian catalogues as given by Ebedjesu, is--The Four
   Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the Three Catholic Epistles, (their
   Canon at first contained no more,) and the Fourteen Epistles of Paul.

   Rufin's order is--The Gospels, the Acts, Paul's Epistles, the Catholic
   Epistles, and the Revelation. The Council of Carthage has the same.
   Gregory Nazianzen the same; only the Revelation is omitted.
   Amphilochius the same, and the book of Revelation, mentioned as
   doubtful. Nicephorus of Constantinople, the same, and Revelation
   omitted.

   This, therefore, appears to have been the order in which the books of
   the New Testament succeeded each other in most ancient copies; and is
   the one now in general use.

   But Epiphanius has an order different from any of these, as
   follows--The Four Gospels, Paul's Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles,
   the Seven Catholic Epistles, and the Revelation. Jerome follows the
   same order; and also Euthalius.

   Augustine varies in his arrangement of the sacred books. In one place,
   he puts the Acts last, except Revelation; and in another, he places it
   after Revelation. He also varies in his arrangement of the Epistles of
   Paul, and of the Catholic Epistles.

   The order of Innocent the First, bishop of Rome, is: The Four Gospels,
   Paul's Epistles, the Catholic Epistles, the Acts, and Revelation.

   Isidore of Seville has, in his writings, given several catalogues, in
   all of which he pursues the order last mentioned. The same writer
   informs us, that the books of the New Testament were usually included
   in two divisions, or volumes; the first containing the Gospels; the
   second, the Acts and the Epistles; the book of Revelation being
   omitted.

   Chrysostom follows an order which appears to be peculiar: he places
   first, the Fourteen Epistles of Paul; next, the Four Gospels; then, the
   Acts; and in the last place, the Catholic Epistles. Gelasius places
   Revelation before the Catholic Epistles. The Apostolical Canon, as it
   is called, contains the following catalogue: The Four Gospels, Fourteen
   Epistles of Paul, Seven Catholic Epistles, Two Epistles of Clement, the
   Constitutions, and the Acts. If this were, indeed, the genuine Canon of
   the apostles, as the title imports, it would be decisive, and all other
   authorities would be superfluous; but it is acknowledged by all good
   critics, that it is spurious, and of no authority in settling the early
   Canon.

   The order of the Four Gospels has generally been, as in our copies,
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. Irenæus, Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, the
   Council of Laodicea, Gregory Nazianzen, Amphilochius, the Syrian
   Catalogues, Jerome, Rufin, Augustine, the Alexandrian Manuscript with
   most others, agree in this order.

   But that this order was not uniform, appears from Tertullian, who
   arranges them thus--Matthew, John, Luke, Mark. And the same order of
   the Gospels is followed, in the very ancient Manuscript, commonly
   called, Codex Cantabrigiensis.

   There is very little variation observed in the arrangement of Paul's
   Epistles. They are generally found in the same order as we have them in
   our copies; but this is not universally the case: for in some copies,
   the Epistle to the Hebrews occupies the fourteenth place among Paul's
   Epistles, and in others the tenth. But in all copies, the Epistle to
   the Romans stands first, though not first in the order of time.

   With respect to the time when the gospels were written, no precise
   information can be obtained, as ancient authors differ considerably on
   the subject. It seems to be agreed, however, that they were not
   published immediately after the ascension of Christ: nor all at the
   same time. The best thing which we can do is to place before the reader
   the principal testimonies of the Fathers, and leave him to judge for
   himself. [48]

   The earliest writer who says anything explicitly on this subject is
   Irenæus; but he does not inform us what time intervened between the
   resurrection of Christ, and the writing of these gospels. His words
   are; "For we have not received the knowledge of the way of salvation,
   from any others than those by whom the gospel has been brought to us,
   which gospel they first preached, and afterwards, by the will of God,
   committed to writing, that for time to come it might be the foundation
   and pillar of our faith. Nor, may any say that they preached before
   they had a competent knowledge of the gospel; for after that our Lord
   rose from the dead, and they were endued, from above, with the power of
   the Holy Ghost, which had come down upon them, they received a perfect
   knowledge of all things. They went forth to all the ends of the earth,
   declaring to men the blessing of heavenly peace; having all of them,
   and every one of them, the gospel of God."

   Now let it be considered, that Irenæus was the disciple of Polycarp,
   who was the disciple of the apostle John, and this testimony will have
   great weight in confirming the fact, that the gospels were written by
   the apostles, some time after they began to preach; and that, wherever
   the apostles went, they preached the same gospel to the people.

   Eusebius, to whom we are obliged so often to have recourse as a witness
   of ancient ecclesiastical facts, does not fail us here; "Those
   admirable and truly divine men," says he, "the apostles of Christ, did
   not attempt to deliver the doctrine of their master, with the artifice
   and eloquence of words. . . . Nor were they concerned about writing
   books, being engaged in a' more excellent ministry, which is above all
   human power. Insomuch that Paul, the most able of all, in the furniture
   of words and ideas, has left nothing in writing but a few Epistles. Nor
   were the rest of our Saviour's followers unacquainted with these
   things, as the seventy disciples, and many others besides the twelve
   apostles. Nevertheless, of all the disciples of our Lord, Matthew and
   John only have left us any Memoirs; who, also, as we have been
   informed, were impelled to write, by a kind of necessity." [49]

   Theodore of Mopsuesta, who lived in the latter part of the fourth
   century, has left us the following testimony; "After the Lord's
   ascension to heaven, the disciples stayed a good while at Jerusalem,
   visiting the cities in the vicinity, and preaching chiefly to the Jews:
   and the great Paul was appointed, openly to preach the gospel to the
   Gentiles." "In process of divine Providence, they, not being allowed to
   confine themselves to any one part of the earth, were conducted to
   remote countries. Peter went to Rome; the others elsewhere. John took
   up his abode at Ephesus, visiting, however, other parts of Asia. . . .
   . About this time, the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke, published
   their gospels, which were soon spread over the world, and were received
   by all the faithful with great regard. . . . . . . Numerous Christians
   in Asia having brought these gospels to John, earnestly entreated him
   to write a further account of such things as were needful to be known,
   and had been omitted by the rest; with which request he complied."

   By divers Christian writers of antiquity, it has been asserted, that
   Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, at the earnest request of
   the brethren at Rome, wrote a short gospel, according to what he had
   heard related by Peter. This testimony, among others, is given by
   Jerome in his book of Illustrious Men.

   It is probable that Peter did not visit Rome before the reign of Nero;
   perhaps not until Paul had returned a second time to that city, which
   must have been as late as the year A. D. 63 or 64. Now, as the brethren
   requested of Mark to give them in writing the substance of Peter's
   preaching, his gospel could not have been written at an earlier period.
   And, it would seem, if this fact be undoubted, that they had, until
   this time, never seen a written gospel; and, probably, did not know
   that there was one in existence.

   The Jewish war, according to Josephus, began in the year of our Lord
   66, and ended in September of the year 70; when the city and temple
   were brought to desolation. Now, there is strong probable evidence,
   that the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, were finished before this
   war commenced; that is, before the year of our Lord sixty-six. Each of
   them contains the predictions of our Lord respecting the destruction of
   Jerusalem, and there is no hint in any of them, that the remarkable
   events connected with this overthrow had begun to make their
   appearance. But there are some expressions in these gospels, which
   probably indicate, that the writers thought that these wonderful events
   were at hand; such as the following admonition, "Let him that readeth
   understand."

   It is certain that the Acts of the Apostles could not have been
   finished before A. D. 62 or 63, because the history which it contains
   comes down to that time. The gospel by Luke was probably written a
   short time before. At least, this seems to be the common opinion of
   learned men. Jerome supposes that he composed his gospel at Rome.
   Grotius thinks, that when Paul left Rome Luke went into Greece, and
   there wrote his gospel and the Acts.

   From the introduction to Luke's gospel, it would seem that he knew
   nothing of any authentic written gospel at that time; for he cannot be
   supposed to refer to such, when he says, "Forasmuch as many have taken
   in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are
   most surely believed among us " and if he had known that Matthew had
   written a gospel, he could not easily have avoided some reference to it
   in this place. But the inference of Lardner from this fact, that no
   authentic gospel had been written before this time, is unauthorized,
   and repugnant to all the testimony which we have on the subject. The
   gospel of Matthew might have been circulating for some time among the
   churches in Judea, and yet not be known to Luke, whose labours and
   travels led him, in company with Paul, to visit the Gentile countries
   and cities. If we pay any regard to the opinions of those, who lived
   nearest the times of the apostles, we must believe that the gospel of
   Matthew was first written, and in the vernacular dialect of Judea,
   commonly called Hebrew. The writer of this gospel is also called Levi,
   the son of Alpheus. He was a Galilean by nation, and a publican by
   profession. When called to follow Christ, he was sitting at the receipt
   of custom, where the taxes were paid, but he immediately left all these
   temporal concerns, and attached himself to Christ, who afterwards
   selected him as one of the twelve. From this time he seems to have been
   constantly with Christ until his crucifixion, of which event he was
   doubtless a witness; as he was also of the resurrection and ascension
   of his Lord. On the day of Pentecost, he was present with his brethren,
   and partook of the rich spiritual endowments, which were then bestowed
   on the apostles. But afterwards there is no explicit mention of him in
   the New Testament. In his own catalogue of the twelve, his name
   occupies the eighth place, as it does in the Acts; but in the lists of
   the apostles, contained in the gospels of Luke and Mark, it occupies
   the seventh place.

   There is an almost total obscurity resting on the history of this
   apostle and evangelist. The scene of his labours, after he left Judea,
   seems to have been in regions of which we possess very little accurate
   information to this day. But whether he had Parthia and Persia, or
   Ethiopia, for the field of his apostolical labours, the ancients are
   not agreed. It is by no means impossible that he should have preached
   the gospel, and planted churches, in each of these countries. The
   historian Socrates, in his distribution of the apostles among the
   countries of the globe, assigns Ethiopia to Matthew, Parthia to Thomas,
   and India to Bartholomew.

   The testimony of Eusebius is as follows: "This then was the state of
   the Jews, but the apostles and disciples of our Lord, being dispersed
   abroad, preached in the whole world, Thomas in Parthia; Andrew in
   Scythia, John in Asia, who having lived there a long time, died at
   Ephesus. Peter preached to the dispersed Jews in Pontus, Galatia,
   Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia; at length, coming to Rome, he was there
   crucified, with his head turned down towards the earth, at his own
   request. Paul also died a martyr at Rome, as we are informed by Origen,
   in the third tome of his work on Genesis." But Eusebius makes no
   mention of the apostle Matthew; nor does Jerome, in his account of
   Illustrious Men. [50]

   Clement of Alexandria mentions a circumstance of this apostle's mode of
   life, but nothing more: he says, "That he was accustomed to use a very
   spare diet, eating vegetables, but no flesh."

   Chrysostom, in one of his Homilies, gives the character of Matthew, but
   furnishes us with no facts.

   It is probable, therefore, that very little was known in the west,
   respecting the lives, labours and death, of those apostles who
   travelled far to the east. None of them, it is probable, ever returned;
   and there existed no regular channels for the communication of
   intelligence from those distant regions. The honour of martyrdom has
   been given to them all, and the thing is not improbable; but there are
   no authentic records, from which we can derive any certain information
   on this subject. The Fathers, whose writings have come down to us, seem
   to have been as much in the dark as we are, respecting the preaching
   and death of the majority of the apostles. There are, it is true,
   traditions in Ethiopia and the east, in regard to some of them, but
   they are too uncertain to deserve any serious consideration.

SECTION IV.

   TESTIMONIES TO MATTHEW'S GOSPEL--TIME OF PUBLICATION--LANGUAGE IN WHICH
   IT WAS ORIGINALLY COMPOSED.

   BUT while we know so little of the apostolical labours of the
   Evangelist Matthew, it is pleasing to find that the testimonies
   respecting the genuineness of his gospel are so early and full. To
   these we will now direct our attention.

   Barnabas, the companion of Paul, is said by the ancient ecclesiastical
   writers, to have left an Epistle of some length. This is mentioned by
   Origen, Jerome and Eusebius, and is frequently quoted by Clement of
   Alexandria. An Epistle under his name is still extant, but whether
   written by this apostolic man is very much disputed. Whoever was the
   author, it seems to have been written shortly after the destruction of
   Jerusalem, and by a zealous Christian. In this Epistle, there are many
   sentences found in the gospel of Matthew, but no reference to any book
   of the New Testament. In some of them, however, there are evident signs
   that these passages which are found in the gospel were quotations. One
   of these is in Matthew xx. 16. And in this Epistle it is thus
   introduced; "Let us, therefore, beware, lest it should happen unto us,
   as it is written, There are many called, but few chosen."

   As the Christians who lived at the beginning of the gospel, did not
   receive their instruction from written gospels, but from the preaching
   of the apostles, they would often express in their writings the same
   things in substance which we read in the Evangelists, so that unless
   they use marks of quotation, it cannot be certainly known that these
   phrases are cited from any book. They may have learnt them from hearing
   the apostles, or even Christ himself. But when they in the text cited,
   say, as it is written, it may fairly be inferred, that when found in
   one of the gospels it was taken from it.

   The circumstance above mentioned furnishes a satisfactory reason for
   the fact, that in the writings of the apostolical Fathers, there is so
   seldom any reference to the books of the New Testament. These men
   received their knowledge of Christianity before any of the books of the
   New Testament were written; and although they existed when they wrote,
   they would not be so likely to refer to them as if they had derived
   their knowledge from them.

   Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, who was acquainted with the Apostle John,
   expressly mentions Matthew's gospel; and asserts,' That he wrote the
   divine oracles in Hebrew." [51]

   Justin Martyrr, who lived in the middle of the second century, has in
   many places cited the very words of the gospel of Matthew, but without
   mentioning his name. One instance will be sufficient: "And it is
   written in the gospel, that he said, All things are delivered to me of
   my Father, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father: neither the
   Father, save the Son, and they to whom the Son will reveal him." This
   is taken from the gospel of Matthew, xi. 27. [52]

   Irenæus, bishop of Lyons, who was born in Asia, and was acquainted with
   Polycarp, the disciple of the apostle John, gives the following
   testimony: "We have not received the knowledge of the way of our
   salvation by any others, than those through whom the gospel has come
   down to us; which gospel they first preached, and afterwards, by the
   will of God, transmitted to us in writing, that it might be the
   foundation and pillar of our faith."--"For after our Lord had risen
   from the dead, and they were clothed with the power of the Holy Spirit
   descending upon them from on high, were filled with all gifts, and
   possessed perfect knowledge, they went forth to the ends of the earth,
   spreading the glad tidings of those blessings which God has conferred
   on us, and announcing peace from heaven to men; having all, and every
   one alike, the gospel of God. Matthew among the Hebrews published a
   gospel in their own language; while Peter and Paul were preaching the
   gospel at Rome and founding a church there. And after their departure,
   Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, himself delivered to us in
   writing what Peter preached; and Luke, the companion of Paul, recorded
   the gospel preached by him. Afterwards John, the disciple of the Lord,
   who leaned upon his breast, likewise published a gospel, while he dwelt
   at Ephesus, in Asia. And all these have taught us, that there is one
   God, the maker of heaven and earth, announced by the law and the
   prophets; and one Christt, the Son of God." [53]

   In another place Irenæus characterizes all the four gospels, by setting
   down the beginning of each; where of Matthew he says, "Matthew
   proclaims his human generation, saying, The genealogy of Jesus Christ,
   the Son of David, the Son of Abraham."

   In another place he says, "The gospel of Matthew was delivered to the
   Jews."

   This early testimony from a learned man living so near the times of the
   apostles is invaluable, and must be satisfactory to every candid mind
   of the genuineness of the four gospels. Other decisive testimonies
   might be adduced from the same author, but they are unnecessary.

   Hegesippus, who also lived and flourished in the second century, was
   the author of an Ecclesiastical History extending from the death of
   Christ to his own times, which unhappily has not come down to us. All
   that remains is a few fragments preserved by Eusebius. In one of these
   he cites a passage from the gospel of Matthew xiii. 16, "Blessed are
   your eyes which see, and your ears which hear."

   Athenagoras also was a writer of the second century. He wrote two
   books, one on the Resurrection, the other, an Apology for the
   Christians. Of this man Philip Sidetes says, "that he was a heathen and
   determined to write against Christianity, but by reading the gospels
   was converted. He has citations from nearly all the books of the New
   Testament. From the gospel of Matthew he quotes the following words;
   "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for, them that
   persecute you, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in
   heaven, who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and unjust." Matt. v. 44, 45.

   Origen, who was born in the second century, and wrote and flourished in
   the beginning of the third, has left us the following testimony:
   "According to the traditions received by me, the first gospel was
   written by Matthew, once a publican, afterwards a disciple of Jesus
   Christ, who delivered it to the Jewish believers, composed in the
   Hebrew language." And in another place he says, " Matthew wrote for the
   Hebrews."

   Eusebius, who lived about a hundred years later than Origen, informs
   us, that " Matthew, having first preached the gospel to the Hebrews,
   when about to go to other people, delivered to them, in their own
   language, the gospel written by himself; by that supplying the want of
   his presence with them, whom he was about to leave." [54]

   In the Synopsis, which has been ascribed to Athanasius, it is said,
   "Matthew wrote his gospel in the Hebrew, and published it at
   Jerusalem." Cyril of Jerusalem testifies, "That Matthew wrote in
   Hebrew." Epiphanius says the same, and adds, "Matthew wrote first, and
   Mark soon after him, being a follower of Peter at Rome." Gregory
   Nazianzen says, " That Matthew wrote for the Hebrews." EBEDJESU, the
   Syrian, "That Matthew, the first Evangelist, published his gospel in
   Palestine, written in Hebrew."

   Jerome, in his Commentary on Matthew, testifies that "The first
   Evangelist is Matthew, the publican, surnamed Levi, who wrote his
   gospel in Judea, in the Hebrew language, chiefly for the Jews who
   believed in Jesus, and did not join the shadow of the law with the
   truth of the gospel."

   Again, in his book of Ecclesiastical Writers, he says, "Matthew, called
   also Levi, of a publican made an apostle, first of all wrote a gospel
   in the Hebrew language, for the sake of those in Judea who believed. By
   whom it was afterwards translated into Greek is uncertain."

   Chrysostom, in his introduction to this gospel, writes, "Matthew is
   said to have written his gospel at the request of the Jewish believers,
   who desired him to put down in writing what he had said to them by word
   of mouth; and it is said he wrote in Hebrew."

   Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, lived in the latter part of the second
   century, and wrote several works. Jerome in his prologue to the gospel
   of Matthew, says, "I have read the commentaries of Theophilus, bishop
   of Antioch." In another place he says: "Theophilus, the seventh bishop
   of Antioch after Peter, who collected into one the words of the four
   gospels."

   It would be unnecessary to adduce any testimonies from later writers;
   but as they mention some circumstances probably received by tradition,
   and not contained in the earlier testimonies, I will subjoin a few of
   them.

   Cosmas, who lived in the sixth century, reports, that "Matthew is the
   first that wrote a gospel. A persecution having arisen after the
   stoning of Stephen, and he having resolved to go from that place, the
   believers entreated him to leave with them a written instruction; with
   which request he complied."

   Another author of this century, who wrote a discourse on Matthew, has
   left this testimony: "The occasion of Matthew's writing is said to have
   been this--there being a great persecution in Palestine, so that there
   was danger lest the faithful should be dispersed; that they might not
   be without teaching, they requested Matthew to write for them an
   accurate history of all Christ's words and works; that wherever they
   should be, they might have with them the ground of their faith."

   In the Paschal Chronicle, written in the seventh century, it is
   intimated, that Matthew published his gospel about fifteen years after
   our Lord's ascension.

   Euthymius, in the beginning of the twelfth century, says, "That this
   gospel was first written in the Hebrew language for the Jewish
   believers, eight years after our Lord's ascension."

   From these testimonies, it appears, that the Fathers had no certain
   knowledge of the exact time when Matthew wrote his gospel. Irenæus
   refers it to the period when Paul and Peter were preaching at Rome, but
   he speaks vaguely on the subject.

   The writers who mention a precise time, lived at too late a period to
   give testimony on this subject. But all agree, that this was the first
   gospel written.

   Among the moderns, there is much diversity of opinion, as might be
   expected, where there is little else than conjecture to guide them.
   Lardner and Basnage supposed that this gospel was not written before A.
   D. 64. Cave thought that it was written fifteen years after the
   ascension of Christ. Jeremiah Jones is in favour of that opinion which
   places it eight years after the ascension. Grotius and G. J. Vossius
   are of the same opinion. So also is Wetstein. But Tillemont carries it
   up to the third year after the crucifixion of our Saviour. [55] Lardner
   and Percy have adduced arguments for a late origin of this gospel,
   derived from internal evidence, but they are of very inconsiderable
   weight.

   As it is agreed that it was written before Matthew left Judea to preach
   the gospel in foreign parts, and as this event seems to have occurred
   after the persecution which was raised at Judea against the church, it
   seems probable, that they are nearest the truth, who place it about
   eight years after the ascension of Christ; which date unites more
   writers in its support than any other.

   Not only the date, but the original language of this gospel has been
   made a subject of controversy. By the testimonies already cited, it
   seems that there was but one opinion among the ancients in regard to
   this matter. With one voice they inform us, that it was written in
   Hebrew; or in the vernacular tongue of the Jews, which in the
   Scriptures, and by the Christian Fathers, is called Hebrew. This
   language is now called Syro-Chaldaic, or Western Aramean, but it
   consisted chiefly of words derived from Hebrew origin, and was, in
   fact, the Hebrew corrupted by a large mixture of foreign words, and by
   various changes in the prefixes and affixes of the words. This was the
   language in which Jesus Christ spoke and delivered all his discourses;
   and which the apostles were accustomed to speak from their childhood.

   Although the Greek language was understood by all the learned in Judea
   at this time, and by many of the people, yet it was not the vernacular
   language of the Jews dwelling in Palestine. In a book composed for the
   immediate use of the churches in Judea, it was necessary that it should
   be in that language which they all understood; which was neither pure
   Hebrew nor Greek. The testimony of the Fathers is, therefore,
   strengthened by a consideration of the nature of the case. And if it
   were not so, yet when the judgment of modern critics stands opposed to
   the universal testimony of the ancients, in regard to a matter of fact,
   which occurred not long before their time, there ought to be no
   hesitation which is most deserving of credit.

   There is, however, one difficulty attending this opinion, which is,
   that it supposes that the original of this gospel is lost, and we have
   now nothing but a translation, which opinion would lessen its canonical
   authority.

   It must be confessed, that this is a consequence of a serious kind, and
   one which ought not to be received respecting any canonical book
   without necessity. But does this conclusion necessarily follow from the
   admission, that this gospel was originally composed in the Hebrew
   language? Might there not have been a version immediately prepared by
   the writer himself, or by some other person under his superintendence?
   This being the first gospel that was composed, it would naturally be in
   great request with all Christians who knew of its existence; and as
   none but the Jewish Christians could understand it, as first published,
   it is exceedingly probable, that a request was made of the author to
   publish an edition of it in Greek, also, by those who did not
   understand the Hebrew; or, by such as were going to preach the gospel
   in countries where the Greek language was in common use.

   It has been considered a strong objection to the Hebrew original of
   this gospel, that no person, whose writings have come down to us, has
   intimated that he had ever seen it; and from the earliest times it
   seems to have existed in the Greek language. But this fact is perfectly
   consistent with the supposition now made; for the desolation of Judea,
   and dispersion of the Jewish Christians, having taken place within a
   few years after the publication of Matthew's gospel, the copies of the
   original Hebrew would be confined to the Jewish converts; and as other
   Christians had copies in the Greek, of equal authenticity with the
   Hebrew, no inquiries would be made after the latter. These Jewish
   Christians, after their removal, dwindled away in a short time, and a
   large part of them became erroneous in their faith; and though they
   retained the Hebrew gospel of Matthew, they altered and corrupted it to
   suit their own heretical opinions. There is reason to believe, that the
   gospel of the Nazarenes, was the identical gospel of Matthew, which in
   process of time was greatly mutilated and corrupted by the Ebionites.
   Of this gospel much is said by the Fathers, and, in the proper place,
   we shall give some account of it. [56]

   The only remaining objection of any weight against the ancient opinion,
   is, that the gospel according to Matthew, as we now have it, has no
   appearance of being a translation, but has the air and style of an
   original. But if the hypothesis, suggested above be adopted, this
   objection also will vanish; for according to this the Greek is an
   original, as well as the Hebrew, it having been written by Matthew
   himself, or by some disciple under his direction. But whether the Greek
   of Matthew was written by himself or not, it is certain that it was not
   later than the apostolic age, and received the approbation of apostles
   or apostolic men, which is sufficient to establish its authenticity.

   Casaubon, Walton, Tomline, Cave, Hammond, Mill, Harwood, Owen,

   of argument and authority so nearly balanced, that Dr. Townson, and a
   few others, have adopted a middle course, viz. the opinion stated

   are removed. The only objection is the want of evidence. Horne and

SECTION V.

   GOSPEL OF MARK--ON WHAT OCCASION PUBLISHED--ASCRIBED TO THE DICTATION
   OF PETER BY ALL THE FATHERS.

   THE author of the second gospel, as they stand in the Canon, was Mark;
   the same who is mentioned in the first Epistle of Peter, (v. 13;) but
   whether he was the same as John Mark, of Jerusalem, who travelled for a
   while with Paul and Barnabas, has been doubted by Grotius, Cave, Dupin
   and Tillemont; but the common opinion is in its favour, and the
   objections to it are not of much weight: and as there is no clear
   evidence, that there were two persons of this name mentioned in
   Scripture, I shall consider all that is said of Mark, as having
   reference to the same person.

   Paul was offended at him because he declined accompanying him and
   Barnabas on the whole tour which they made, to preach the gospel; for,
   when they came to Perga, Mark departed from them, and returned to
   Jerusalem. And when Paul and Barnabas were about to undertake a second
   journey together, the latter insisted on taking Mark as their minister,
   but Paul would by no means consent to it, because he had forsaken them
   on their first mission. This difference of opinion gave rise to a sharp
   altercation, which terminated in the separation of these venerable
   colleagues. Mark now. travelled with Barnabas, but, probably, soon
   afterwards attached himself to Peter, with whom he seems to have
   continued until the death of that apostle.

   But Paul himself seems to have been reconciled to Mark, and to have
   valued his assistance in the work of the ministry; for, in his second
   Epistle to Timothy, he writes, "Take Mark and bring him with thee, for
   he is profitable unto me for the ministry." 2 Tim. iv. 11. He also
   mentions him in his Epistle to Philemon. Phil. 24.

   When this gospel was composed, has not been particularly mentioned by
   any ancient author, except that it is said to have been after Peter
   came to Rome, which could not be much earlier than A. D. 62 or 63. It
   is stated, that Mark was requested by the brethren at Rome to put down
   in writing the substance of Peter's preaching; and on this account,
   this gospel among the primitive Christians was as familiarly known by
   the name of the gospel of Peter as of Mark. This circumstance has led
   some to assert, that Mark wrote his gospel in Latin, as this was the
   language of Rome; but in those days almost all the Romans understood
   Greek. And the Jewish converts, who composed a large portion of the
   first churches, understood Greek much better than Latin. But there is
   no need to argue this point. There is no ancient author who testifies
   that Mark wrote in Latin. The testimony is uniform that he wrote in
   Greek.

   Baronius is almost the only learned man who has advocated the Latin
   origin of the gospel of Mark, and he has nothing to produce in favour
   of this opinion from antiquity, except the subscription to the Syriac,
   Arabic and Persic versions of the New Testament, where, at the end of
   Mark's gospel, it is said, "He spoke and preached in Latin at Rome;"
   but this does not say that he wrote his gospel in Latin. But these
   subscriptions are of very little authority in matters of this kind. No
   one knows when, or by whom they were placed there; and, although three
   versions are mentioned, they make up no more than one witness, for,
   probably all the others borrowed this inscription from the Syriac.

   Augustine called Mark "the abridger of Matthew;" and it must be
   confessed, that he often uses the same words, and tells more concisely
   what the other had related more copiously; yet, there is satisfactory
   evidence, that Mark's gospel is an original work. It contains many
   things which are not in the gospel of Matthew, and some mentioned by
   that Evangelist are here related with additional circumstances.

   All authors do not agree that Mark wrote his gospel at Rome, but some
   think at Alexandria: the former opinion, however, was received with
   almost universal consent. See the testimony of Irenaeus before cited.
   To which may be added what he says in another place, that, "Mark begins
   with the prophetic spirit which came down from above to men, saying,
   the beginning of the gospel of Christ."

   Some of the testimonies of the Fathers respecting this gospel will now
   be given.

   Eusebius out of Papias, and a lost work of Clement of Alexandria,
   relates, "That when Peter in the reign of Claudius, had come to Rome,
   and had defeated Simon Magus, the people were so inflamed with love for
   the Christian truths, as not to be satisfied with the hearing of them,
   unless they also had them written down. That accordingly they, with
   earnest entreaties, applied themselves to Mark, the companion of Peter,
   and whose gospel we now have, praying him that he would write down for
   them, and leave with them an account of the doctrines which had been
   preached to them; that they did not desist in their request, till they
   had prevailed on him, and procured his writing that which is now the
   gospel of Mark; that when Peter came to know this, he was, by the
   direction of the Holy Spirit, pleased with the request of the people,
   and confirmed the gospel which was written for the use of the
   churches." [58]

   The same Eusebius relates in another part of his works, what Papias had
   testified concerning Mark's gospel, "That Mark, who was Peter's
   interpreter, exactly wrote down whatsoever he remembered, though not in
   the same order of time in which the several things were said or done by
   Christ; for he neither heard nor followed Christ, but was a companion
   of Peter, and composed his gospel, rather with the intent of the
   people's profit, than writing a regular history; so that he is in no
   fault, if he wrote some things according to his memory, he designing no
   more than to omit nothing which he had heard, and to relate nothing
   false." [59]

   Another testimony from Clement of Alexandria is given by Eusebius, in
   which it is said, "When Peter was publicly preaching the gospel at
   Rome, by the influences of the Holy Spirit, many of the converts
   desired Mark, as having been long a companion of Peter, and who well
   remembered what he preached, to write down his discourses: that upon
   this he composed his gospel, and gave it to those who made this
   request; which when Peter knew, he neither obstructed nor encouraged
   the work." [60]

   Irenæus says, "That after the death of Peter and Paul who had been
   preaching at Rome, Mark the disciple and interpreter of Peter, wrote
   down what he had heard him preach." Tertullian informs us, " That the
   gospel published by Mark may be reckoned Peter's, whose interpreter he
   was." Origen adds, "That Mark wrote his gospel according to the
   dictates of Peter." Jerome tells us, "That Mark the disciple and
   interpreter of Peter, wrote a short gospel from what he had heard of
   Peter, at the request of the brethren at Rome, which when Peter knew,
   he approved and published in our churches, commanding the reading of it
   by his own authority."

   Besides these testimonies which are very explicit, and all go to show
   that Mark received his gospel from the preaching of Peter, there are
   some internal evidences which look the same way. There are in the other
   Evangelists several circumstances and facts which make very much for
   the credit of Peter, not one of which is hinted at in this gospel.
   Particular instances of this kind may be read in the third volume of
   "Jones' New Method of Settling the Canon."

   Of the canonical authority of this gospel no one of the ancients, I
   believe, ever entertained a doubt. Some of the moderns, however, have
   questioned whether we have any evidence, that Mark and Luke wrote by a
   plenary inspiration since they were not apostles. But that Mark's
   gospel is canonical, is established by all the rules applicable to the
   case. It was always contained in the early catalogues; was read as
   Scripture in the churches; was quoted as Scripture by the Fathers; was
   inserted in the earliest versions; and never doubted formerly, by any
   Christian writer. But this subject will be resumed hereafter.

   Eusebius reports, "That Peter, out of the abundance of his modesty, did
   not think himself worthy to write a gospel; but Mark, who was his
   friend and disciple, is said to have recorded Peter's relations, and
   the acts of Jesus." And again, "Peter testifies these things of
   himself, for all things recorded by Mark are said to be memoirs of
   Peter's discourses."

   In the Synopsis ascribed to Athanasius it is said, "That the gospel
   according to Mark was dictated by Peter at Rome, and published by Mark,
   and preached by him in Alexandria, Pentapolis and Libya."

   The testimony of Epiphanius is, "That Matthew wrote first, and Mark
   soon after him, being a companion of Peter at Rome; that Mark was one
   of the seventy disciples, and likewise one of those who were offended
   at the words of Christ, recorded in the sixth chapter of the gospel of
   John; that he then forsook the Saviour, but was afterwards reclaimed by
   Peter, and being filled with the Spirit wrote a gospel."

   Gregory Nazianzen says, "That Mark wrote his gospel for the Italians."
   Chrysostom testifies, that "Mark wrote in Egypt at the request of the
   believers there;" but in another place, he says, " It cannot be
   ascertained in what place each of the Evangelists wrote." Victor
   informs us, "That Mark was also called John, and was the son of Mary;
   that he wrote a gospel after Matthew; that for a while he accompanied
   Paul and Barnabas his relation, but when he came to Rome he joined
   Peter. When he was obliged to quit Rome, he was requested by the
   brethren to write a history of his preaching, and of his heavenly
   doctrine; with which request he readily complied."

   Cosmas of Alexandria writes, "That Mark the second Evangelist wrote a
   gospel at Rome, by the dictation of Peter." OEcumenius says, "This John
   who also is called Mark, nephew to Barnabas, wrote the gospel which
   goes by his name; and was also the disciple of Peter."

   Theophylact informs us, "That the gospel according to Mark was written
   at Rome, ten years after the ascension of Jesus Christ, at the request
   of the believers there; for this Mark was a disciple of Peter. His name
   was John, and he was nephew to Barnabas, the companion of Paul."

   Euthymius concurs exactly in this testimony. His words are, "The gospel
   of Mark was written about ten years after our Lord's ascension, at the
   request of the believers at Rome, or, as some say, in Egypt; that Mark
   was, at first, much with his uncle Barnabas and Paul, but afterwards
   went with Peter to Rome, from whom he received the whole history of his
   gospel." Nicephorus says, "Only two of the twelve have left memoirs of
   our Lord's life, and two of the seventy, Mark and Luke." And a little
   after, "Mark and Luke published their gospels, by the direction of
   Peter and Paul." Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, has the following
   words: "In the time of Nero, Peter, the prince of the apostles, making
   use of Mark, wrote a gospel at Rome, in the Roman language."

   The reader will recollect, that this last writer lived as late as the
   tenth century, which will account for his calling Peter the prince of
   the apostles, a language entirely foreign to the early ecclesiastical
   writers. And Selden is of opinion, that by the Roman language he meant
   the Greek, which was then in common use at Rome; and it is well known,
   that in our times the modern Greek language is called Romaic. Jones and
   Lardner concur in the opinion of Selden.

SECTION VI.

   GOSPEL OF LUKE--TESTIMONIES OF THE FATHERS RESPECTING IT.

   THE third gospel is that of Luke. He is mentioned in Scripture as the
   companion of Paul in his travels; and when that apostle was sent a
   prisoner to Rome this evangelist accompanied him, and continued with
   him during his two years' confinement in that city, as may be gathered
   from Paul's Epistles, written during this period. Whether he was the
   same as "the beloved physician," Col. iv. 14, mentioned by Paul, is
   uncertain, but the general opinion is in favour of it. It is also
   disputed, whether or not he was one of the seventy disciples. Without
   undertaking to decide these points, I will proceed to lay before the
   reader the principal testimonies of the Fathers respecting this gospel
   and its author.

   Irenæus asserts, "That Luke, the companion of Paul, put down in a book
   the gospel preached by him." Again, he says, "Luke was not only a
   companion but a fellow-labourer of the apostles, especially of Paul."
   He calls him, "a disciple and fellow-labourer of the apostles." "The
   apostles," says he, "envying none, plainly delivered to all the things
   which they had heard from the Lord." So likewise Luke, envying no man,
   has delivered to us what he learned from them, as he says, "even as
   they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses,
   and ministers of his word." [61]

   Eusebiuss informs us, that Clement of Alexandria bore a large testimony
   to this, as well as to the other gospels; and he mentions a tradition
   concerning the order of the gospels, which Clement had received from
   presbyters of more ancient times--That the gospels containing the
   genealogies were written first."

   Tertullian speaks of Matthew and John as disciples of Christ; of Mark
   and Luke as disciples of the apostles; however, he ascribes the same
   authority to the gospels written by them as to the others. "The
   gospel," says he,' which Mark published, may be said to be Peter's,
   whose interpreter Mark was; and Luke's digest is often ascribed to
   Paul. And indeed it is easy to take that for the Master's which the
   disciples published." Again, "Moreover, Luke was not an apostle, but an
   apostolic man; not a master but a disciple: certainly less than his
   master; certainly so much later, as he is a follower of Paul, the last
   of the apostles."

   Origen mentions the gospels in the order commonly received--"The
   third," says he, "is that according to Luke, the gospel commended by
   Paul, published for the sake of the Gentile converts." In his
   commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, which we now have in a Latin
   version only, he writes, "Some say Lucius is Lucas, the evangelist, as
   indeed it is not uncommon to write names, sometimes according to the
   original form; sometimes according to the Greek and Roman termination."

   Eusebius has left us the following testimony concerning Luke the
   evangelist--"And Luke who was of Antioch, and by profession a
   physician, for the most part a companion of Paul, who had, likewise,
   more than a slight acquaintance with the other apostles, has left us,
   in two books, divinely inspired, evidences of the art of healing souls,
   which he had learned from them. One of them is the gospel which he
   professeth to have written, as they delivered it to him, who from the
   beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of his word." "With all
   whom," he says, "he had been perfectly acquainted from the first." And
   in another place, he says, " Luke hath delivered, in his gospel, a
   certain account of such things as he had been assured of by his
   intimate acquaintance and familiarity with Paul, and his conversation
   with the other apostles." [62]

   In the Synopsis ascribed to Athanasius, it is said, "That the gospel of
   Luke was dictated by the apostle Paul, and written and published by the
   blessed apostle and physician Luke." Gregory Nazianzen says, "That Luke
   wrote for the Greeks;" and Gregory Nyssen, "That Luke was as much a
   physician for the soul as the body."

   The testimony of Jerome concerning Luke is as follows: "Luke, who was
   of Antioch, and by profession a physician, not unskilful in the Greek
   language, a disciple of the apostle Paul, and the constant companion of
   his travels, wrote a gospel, and another excellent volume, entitled,
   the Acts of the Apostles . . . . It is supposed that Luke did not learn
   his gospel from the apostle Paul only, who had not conversed with the
   Lord in the flesh, but also from other apostles, which likewise he owns
   at the beginning of his volume, saying, Even as they delivered them
   unto us who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the
   word.' Therefore, he wrote the gospel from the information of others;
   but the Acts he composed from his own knowledge." [63]

   The same writer in his preface to his commentary on Matthew, says, "The
   third evangelist is Luke the physician, a Syrian of Antioch, who was a
   disciple of the apostle Paul, and published his gospel in the countries
   of Achaia and Boeotia." In another place he observes, "That some said
   that Luke had been a proselyte to Judaism, before his conversion to
   Christianity." Chrysostom, in his first homily on the gospel of
   Matthew, has this remark: "Luke had the fluency of Paul, Mark the
   conciseness of Peter, both learning of their masters."

   Isidore of Seville, says, "Of the four evangelists, the first and last
   relate what they had heard Christ say, or had seen him perform. Matthew
   wrote his gospel first in Judea; then Mark in Italy; Luke, the third,
   in Achaia; John, the last, in Asia." And again, "of all the
   evangelists, Luke, the third in order, is reckoned to have been the
   most skilful in the Greek tongue. For he was a physician, and wrote his
   gospel in Greek."

   In Theophylact's preface to Matthew's gospel, it is said, "There are
   four evangelists, two of whom, Matthew and John, were of the apostles;
   the other two, Mark and Luke, were of the number of the seventy. Mark
   was a disciple and companion of Peter; Luke of Paul . . . . Luke wrote
   fifteen years after Christ's ascension."

   In his commentary on Luke he observes, "That it appears from Luke's
   Introduction, that he was not from the beginning a disciple, but only
   afterwards. For others were disciples from the beginning, as Peter, and
   the sons of Zebedee, who delivered to him the things which they had
   seen or heard."

   Euthymius says, "Luke was a native of Antioch, and a physician. He was
   a hearer of Christ, and, as some say, one of his seventy disciples, as
   well as Mark. He was afterwards very intimate with Paul. He wrote his
   gospel, with Paul's permission, fifteen years after our Lord's
   ascension."

   Eutychius, patriarch of Constantinople, has handed down the following
   account: "In the time of the same emperor, (Nero) Luke wrote his gospel
   in Greek, to a notable and wise man of the Romans, whose name was
   Theophilus; to whom also he wrote the Acts, or the history of the
   disciples. The evangelist Luke was a companion of the apostle Paul,
   going with him wherever he went. For which reason the apostle Paul, in
   one of his epistles, says, Luke the physician salutes you.'"

   The same arguments by which the canonical authority of the gospels of
   Matthew and Mark were established, apply with their full force to the
   gospel of Luke. It was universally received as canonical by the whole
   primitive church--has a place in every catalogue of the books of the
   New Testament, which was ever published--is constantly referred to and
   cited by the Fathers as a part of sacred Scripture--and was one of the
   books constantly read in the churches, as a part of the rule of faith
   and practice for all believers.

   Marcion, the heretic, it is true, had a gospel according to Luke, which
   differed essentially from that in the Canon, but his authority has no
   weight.

SECTION VII.

   THE OBJECTIONS OF J. D. MICHAELIS TO THE CANONICAL AUTHORITY OF THE
   GOSPELS OF MARK AND LUKE, CONSIDERED AND ANSWERED.

   J. D. MICHAELIS, in his introduction to the New Testament, as
   translated from the German by Bishop Marsh, in the third section of the
   third chapter, speaking of the gospels of Mark and Luke, and of the
   Acts of the Apostles, and of the grounds of placing them in the Canon,
   says, "I must confess that I am unable to find a satisfactory proof of
   their inspiration, and the more I investigate the subject, and the
   oftener I compare their writings with those of Matthew and John, the
   greater are my doubts." He then goes on to say, that in a former
   edition of this work he had stated the arguments on both sides of the
   question, but although uncertain which he should prefer, yet he had
   rather inclined to the affirmative. But now he tells us, that he is
   strongly inclined to the negative.

   The first argument for the inspiration of these gospels, which the
   learned professor considers, is derived from the fact, that Mark and
   Luke were companions and assistants of the apostles. This, he says, can
   afford no proof of their inspiration, even if it could be shown that
   they were endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, of
   which, however, there is no historical proof. Because a disciple might
   possess these gifts, and yet his writings not be inspired. And if we
   ground the argument for their inspiration on the character of an
   apostle's assistant, then we must receive as canonical the genuine
   epistle of Clement of Rome, and the writings of other apostolical
   Fathers.

   The next argument which he considers is, that the apostles themselves
   have recommended these gospels as canonical in their epistles. That the
   passages depended on for proof, do refer to these or any other written
   gospels, the professor denies: but even if they did, he considers the
   evidence unsatisfactory; for he supposes that they might have commended
   a book as containing genuine historical accounts, without vouching for
   its inspiration.

   The testimony of the Fathers, that these gospels were approved by Peter
   and Paul respectively, and with Matthew's gospel were shown to the
   apostle John, the learned professor sets aside with very little
   ceremony.

   And, finally, he demurs, in regard to the evidence of the canonical
   authority of these books, derived from the testimony of the whole
   primitive church, by which they were undoubtedly received into the
   Canon; and suggests, that the apostles might have recommended them and
   the primitive church have accepted them, as works indispensable to a
   Christian on account of the importance of their contents, and that by
   insensible degrees they acquired the character of being inspired.

   On these reasonings and objections against the inspiration and
   canonical authority of several important books, which have hitherto
   held an unquestioned place in the Canon of the New Testament, and
   coming from the pen of a man, too, of such extensive Biblical learning,
   I think it necessary to detain the reader with some remarks, which I
   hope will have the effect of counteracting the pernicious influence of
   the opinions which have been exhibited above.

   1. In the first place, then, I would observe, that it will be admitted
   that Mark and Luke were humble, pious men; also that they were
   intelligent, well informed men, and must have known that the committing
   to writing the facts and doctrines comprehended in the gospel, was not
   left to the discretion or caprice of every disciple, but became the
   duty of those only who were inspired by the Holy Ghost to undertake the
   work. Now, if these two disciples had been uninspired, or not under the
   immediate direction of apostles who possessed plenary inspiration, it
   would have argued great presumption in them, without any direction, to
   write gospels for the instruction of the church. The very fact of their
   writing, is, therefore, a strong evidence that they believed themselves
   to be inspired. There is then little force in the remark of the learned
   professor, that neither Mark nor Luke have declared in any part of
   their writings that they were inspired; for such a declaration was
   unnecessary; their conduct in undertaking to write such books, is the
   best evidence that they believed themselves called to this work.

   And the objection to this argument, from the writings of other
   apostolical men, is not valid; for none of them ever undertook to write
   gospels for the use of the church. All attempts at writing other
   gospels than the four were considered by the primitive church as
   impious; because the writers were uninspired men.

   2. But the universal reception of these books by the whole primitive
   church as canonical, and that while some of the apostles were living,
   is the evidence, which to my mind is conclusive, that they were not
   mere human productions, but compared by divine inspiration. That they
   were thus universally received, I think is manifest, from the
   testimonies which have already been adduced. There is not in all the
   writings of antiquity a hint, that any Christian belonging to the
   church ever suspected that these gospels were inferior in authority to
   the others. No books in the Canon appear to have been received with
   more universal consent, and to have been less disputed. They are
   contained in every catalogue which has come down to us. They are cited
   as Scripture by all that mention them; and are expressly declared by
   the Fathers to be canonical and inspired books.

   Now, let it be remembered, that this is the best evidence which we can
   have that any of the books of the New Testament were written by
   inspiration. I know, indeed, that Michaelis places the whole proof of
   inspiration on the promise made by Christ to his apostles; but while it
   is admitted that this is a weighty consideration, it does not appear to
   be equal in force to the testimony of the universal church, including
   the apostles themselves, that these writings were penned under the
   guidance of the Holy Spirit; for it is not perfectly clear, that the
   promise referred to was confined to the twelve. Certainly Paul, who was
   not of that number, was inspired in a plenary manner, and much the
   larger part of the twelve never wrote anything for the Canon. There is
   nothing in the New Testament which forbids our supposing, that other
   disciples might have been selected to write for the use of the church.
   We do not wish that this should be believed, in regard to any persons
   without evidence; but we think that the proof exists, and arises from
   the undeniable fact, that the writings of these two men were from the
   beginning received as inspired. And this belief must have prevailed
   before the death of the apostles; for all the testimonies concur in
   stating, that the gospel of Mark was seen by Peter, and that of Luke by
   Paul, and approved by them respectively. Now, is it credible, that
   these apostles, and John who survived them many years, would have
   recommended to the Christian church the productions of uninspired men?

   No doubt all the churches at that time looked up to the apostles for
   guidance in all matters that related to the rule of their faith; and a
   general opinion that these gospels were canonical could not have
   obtained without their concurrence. The hypothesis of Michaelis, that
   they were recommended as useful human productions, and by degrees came
   to be considered as inspired writings is in itself improbable, and
   repugnant to all the testimony which has come down to us on the
   subject. If this had been the fact, they would never have been placed
   among the books universally acknowledged, but would have been doubted
   of, or disputed by some. The difference made between inspired books,
   and others in those primitive times, was as great as at any subsequent
   period; and the line of distinction was not only broad, but great pains
   were taken to have it drawn accurately; and when the common opinion of
   the church respecting the gospels was formed, there was no difficulty
   in coming to the certain knowledge of the truth. For thirty years and
   more before the death of the apostle John these two gospels were in
   circulation.

   If any doubt had existed respecting their canonical authority, would
   not the churches and their Elders have had recourse to this infallible
   authority? The general agreement of all Christians over the whole
   world, respecting most of the books of the New Testament, doubtless,
   should be attributed to the authority of the apostles. If, then, these
   gospels had been mere human productions they might have been read
   privately, but never could have found a place in the sacred Canon. The
   objection to these books comes entirely too late to be entitled to any
   weight. The opinion of a modern critic, however learned, is of small
   consideration when opposed to the testimony of the whole primitive
   church, and to the suffrage of the universal church in every age since
   the days of the apostles. The rule of the learned Huet already cited is
   sound, viz. "That all those books should be deemed canonical and
   inspired, which were received as such by those who lived nearest to the
   time when they were published."

   3. But if we should for the sake of argument concede that no books
   should be considered as inspired, but such as were the productions of
   apostles, still these gospels would not be excluded from the Canon. It
   is a fact, in which there is a wonderful agreement among the Fathers,
   that Mark wrote his gospel from the mouth of Peter; that is, he wrote
   down what he had heard this apostle every day declaring in his public
   ministry. And Luke did the same in regard to Paul's preaching. These
   gospels, therefore, may, according to this testimony, be considered as
   more probably belonging to these two apostles, than to the evangelists
   who penned them. They were little more it would seem, if we give full
   credit to the testimony which has been exhibited, than amanuenses to
   the apostles on whom they attended. Paul we know dictated several of
   his Epistles to some of his companions; and if Mark and Luke heard the
   gospel from Peter and Paul so often repeated, that they were perfect
   masters of their respective narratives, and then committed the same to
   writing, are they not virtually the productions of these apostles which
   have been handed down to us? And this was so much the opinion of some
   of the Fathers, that they speak of Mark's gospel as Peter's, and of
   Luke's as Paul's.

   But this is not all. These gospels were shown to these apostles and
   received their approbation. Thus speak the ancients as with one voice;
   and if they had been silent, we might be certain from the circumstances
   of the case, that these evangelists would never have ventured to take
   such an important step as to write and publish the preaching of these
   inspired men, without their express approbation. Now let it be
   considered, that a narrative prepared by a man well acquainted with the
   facts related, may be entirely correct without inspiration; but of this
   we cannot be sure, and therefore it is of great importance to have a
   history of facts from men who were rendered infallible by the
   inspiration of the Holy Spirit. It should be remembered, however, that
   the only advantage of inspiration in giving such a narrative, consists
   in the proper selection of facts and circumstances, and in the
   infallible certainty of the writing. Suppose, then, that an uninspired
   man should prepare an account of such transactions as he had seen or
   heard from eyewitnesses of undoubted veracity, and that his narrative
   should be submitted to the inspection of an apostle, and receive his
   full approbation; might not such a book be considered as inspired? If
   in the original composition there should have crept in some errors,
   (for to err is human,) the inspired reviewer would of course point them
   out and have them corrected; now, such a book would be for all
   important purposes an inspired volume; and would deserve a place in the
   Canon of Holy Scripture. If any credit then is due to the testimony of
   the Christians Fathers, the gospels of Mark and Luke are canonical
   books; for, as was before stated, there is a general concurrence among
   them, that these evangelists submitted their works to the inspection,
   and received the approbation of the apostles Peter and Paul.

   4. Finally, the internal evidence is as strong in favour of the gospels
   under consideration, as of any other books of the New Testament. There
   is no reason to think that Mark and Luke were capable of writing with
   such perfect simplicity and propriety without the aid of inspiration,
   or the assistance of inspired men. If we reject these books from the
   Canon, we must give up the argument derived from internal evidence for
   the inspiration of the sacred Scriptures altogether. It is true the
   learned professor whose opinions we are opposing, has said, "The
   oftener I compare their writings (Mark's and Luke's) with those of
   Matthew and John, the greater are my doubts." And speaking in another
   place of Mark, he says, "In some immaterial instances he seems to have
   erred," and gives it as his opinion, "That they who undertake to
   reconcile Mark with Matthew, or to show that he is nowhere corrected by
   John, experience great difficulty, and have not seldom to resort to
   unnatural explanations." But the learned professor has not mentioned
   any particular cases of irreconcilable discrepancies between this
   evangelist and Matthew; nor does he indicate in what statements he is
   corrected by John. Until something of this kind is exhibited, general
   remarks of this sort are deserving of no consideration.

   To harmonize the evangelists has always been found a difficult task,
   but this does not prove that they contradict each other, or that their
   accounts are irreconcilable. Many things which, at first sight, appear
   contradictory, are found, upon closer examination, to be perfectly
   harmonious; and if there be some things which commentators have been
   unable satisfactorily to reconcile, it is no more than what might be
   expected in narratives so concise, and in which a strict regard to
   chronological order did not enter into the plan of the writers. And if
   this objection be permitted to influence our judgment in this case, it
   will operate against the inspiration of the other evangelists as well
   as Mark; but in our apprehension, when the discrepancies are
   impartially considered, and all the circumstances of the facts candidly
   and accurately weighed, there will be found no solid ground of
   objection to the inspiration of any of these gospels;--certainly
   nothing which can counterbalance the strong evidence arising from the
   style and spirit of the writers. In what respects these two evangelists
   fall short of the others, has never been shown; upon the most thorough
   examination and fair comparison of these inimitable productions, they
   appear to be all indited by the same Spirit, and to possess the same
   superiority to all human compositions.

   Compare these gospels with those which are acknowledged to have been
   written by uninspired men, and you will need no nice power of
   discrimination to see the difference; the first appear in every respect
   worthy of God; the last betray, in every page, the weakness of man.

   I beg leave here to use the words of an excellent writer, in a late
   work: "The gospel of Luke was always, from the very moment of its
   publication, received as inspired as well as authentic. It was
   published during the lives of John, Peter, and Paul, and was approved
   and sanctioned by them as inspired; and received as such by the
   churches, in conformity to the Jewish Canon, which decided on the
   genuineness or spuriousness of the inspired books of their own church,
   by receiving him as a prophet, who was acknowledged as such by the
   testimony of an established prophet. On the same grounds Luke must be
   considered as a true evangelist; his gospel being dictated and approved
   by an apostle, of whose authority there can be no question. There is,
   likewise, sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusions of
   Whitby--that both Mark and Luke were of the number of the seventy, who
   had a commission from Christ to preach the gospel, not to the Jews
   only, but to the other nations--that the Holy Ghost fell on these among
   the numbers of the seventy, who formed a part of the hundred and
   twenty, assembled on the day of Pentecost, and from that time they were
   guided by the influences of the Holy Spirit, in writing or preaching
   the gospel. And if the universal church, from the first ages, received
   this gospel as divinely inspired, on these satisfactory grounds,
   distance of time cannot weaken the evidences of truth, and we are
   required to receive it on the same testimony. That which satisfied
   those who had much better means of judging, should certainly satisfy us
   at this time." [64]

   There is something reprehensible, not to say impious, in that bold
   spirit of modern criticism, which has led many eminent Biblical
   scholars, especially in Germany, first to attack the authority of
   particular books of Scripture, and next to call in question the
   inspiration of the whole volume. To what extent this licentiousness of
   criticism has been carried, I need not say; for it is a matter of
   notoriety, that of late the most dangerous enemies of the Bible have
   been found occupying the place of its advocates; and the critical art
   which was intended for the correction of the text, and the
   interpretation of the sacred books, has, in a most unnatural way, been
   turned against the Bible; and finally, the inspiration of all the
   sacred books has not only been questioned, but scornfully rejected by
   Professors of Theology! And these men, while living on endowments which
   pious benevolence had consecrated for the support of religion, and
   openly connected with churches whose creeds contain orthodox opinions,
   have so far forgotten their high responsibilities, and neglected the
   claims which the church had on them, as to exert all their ingenuity
   and learning to sap the foundation of that system which they were sworn
   to defend. They have had the shameless hardihood to send forth into the
   world, books under their own names, which contain fully as much of the
   poison of infidelity as ever distilled from the pens of the most
   malignant deists, whose writings have fallen as a curse upon the world.
   The only effectual security which we have against this new and most
   dangerous form of infidelity, is found in the spirit of the age, which
   is so superficial and cursory in its reading, that, however many
   elaborate critical works may be published in foreign languages, very
   few of them will be read, even by theological students, in this
   country.

   Even among those who profess to be orthodox in doctrine, a new and
   dangerous opinion of the nature and degree of inspiration possessed by
   the writers of the New Testament, has been broached. It is, that all
   true Christians as they possess the Holy Spirit, are, in a measure,
   inspired; and that the inspiration of the apostles differed from that
   of other Christians only in degree. But that such plenary inspiration
   as precludes the possibility of error, was never granted to any man.

   According to this theory, inspiration differs not at all from that
   spiritual illumination which is granted to every true Christian. But
   this brings no new truths to light, and secures none from all error in
   his opinions, and in his manner of communicating them. It is a theory
   which destroys the certainty and infallibility of the rule of faith.
   For if the apostles were subject to error, every man when he finds
   anything in their writings which he dislikes, will be at liberty to
   suppose that the sacred writer has, in that particular, fallen into
   error. Unless the sacred Scriptures can be referred to as an infallible
   standard, their use is in a great measure destroyed. No inspiration but
   that which is infallible will at all answer the purpose for which the
   Bible was written.

SECTION VIII.

   THE GOSPEL OF JOHN--LIFE OF THIS EVANGELIST--OCCASION AND TIME OF HIS
   WRITING--CANONICAL AUTHORITY INDISPUTABLE.

   THE fourth gospel was written by John, the son of Zebedee and Salome,
   who was originally a fisherman of Galilee, and brother of James; and,
   we may suppose, was the younger of the brothers, as he is generally
   mentioned last, and is commonly reported to have been the youngest of
   all Christ's disciples. They were plain uneducated men, as their
   occupation sufficiently indicates. Probably they had been disciples of
   John the Baptist, and some have conjectured that John the Evangelist
   was one of the two to whom John the Baptist pointed out Jesus, and who
   went after him to his lodging. The other we know was Andrew, Simon
   Peter's brother; and John, in other cases, has concealed his own name,
   where anything is mentioned which could be interpreted to his honour.

   Why these two brothers were surnamed Boanerges, by the Lord, does not
   clearly appear, unless we suppose that the names were prophetic of the
   manner of their preaching, when commissioned as apostles. But there are
   no facts recorded, from which any inference can be drawn in relation to
   this subject. John has been long celebrated for his affectionate
   temper, and for the suavity of his manners, which appear very
   remarkably in all his writings; but there is no evidence that he was
   naturally of a meek temper. The facts in the gospel history would seem
   to indicate that both he and his brother were of a fiery temper, and by
   nature very ambitious; and some have supposed that their surname had
   relation to this ardour of temper,--but this is not very probable.

   We know that John was the bosom friend of Jesus, the disciple whom he
   loved with a peculiar affection; and that he was admitted to all those
   scenes of a very interesting nature, from which most of the other
   disciples were excluded.

   It is also certain that he was present at the crucifixion; stood near
   the cross in company with Mary the mother of our Lord; and that he
   remained at the place until the body of Jesus, now dead, was pierced
   with a spear. On the morning of the resurrection John visited the
   sepulchre, in company with Peter, and was present when Christ made his
   first appearance to the eleven; and when he manifested himself to his
   disciples at the sea of Tiberias. After Pentecost he was with Peter in
   the temple, when the lame man was healed; he accompanied Peter also to
   Samaria, and was present at the council of Jerusalem. From the book of
   Revelation we learn, that this evangelist was for a time an exile in
   the island of Patmos, for the testimony of Jesus, where he was favoured
   with wonderful visions and communications from the Lord.

   It seems to have been intimated to him by his Lord, at the sea of
   Tiberias, that he should survive the destruction of Jerusalem; for when
   Peter asked, "Lord, what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, if I
   will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" which saying
   gave rise to an opinion among the disciples that that disciple should
   not die: "Yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but if I will
   that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" And this accords very
   well with the testimonies of the ancients, who inform us that John
   lived to a great age.

   Irenæuss, in two places of his work against Heretics, says, "That John
   lived to the time of Trajan," which will bring us down to A. D. 98.
   Eusebius understands Clement of Alexandria to say the same thing.
   Origen also testifies, " That John having lived long in Asia was buried
   at Ephesus." Polycrates, who wrote in the second century, and was
   bishop of Ephesus, asserts, " That John was buried in that city."

   Jerome, in his book of Illustrious Men, and in his work against
   Jovinian, says, "That the apostle John lived in Asia to the time of
   Trajan; and dying at a great age, in the sixty-eighth year of our
   Lord's passion, was buried near the city of Ephesus." This account
   would bring down the death of John to A. D. 100, in which year it is
   placed by this writer in his Chronicon. The testimonies for the
   genuineness of the gospel of John are as full and satisfactory as could
   be desired.

   Irenæus tells us, "That the evangelist John designed, by his gospel, to
   confute the errors which Cerinthus had infused into the minds of the
   people, and had been infused by those who were called Nicolaitons; and
   to convince them that there was one God, who made all things by his
   Word; and not, as they imagined, one who was the Creator, and another
   who was the Father of our Lord; one who was the Son of the Creator, and
   another who was the Christ, who continued impassible, and descended
   upon Jesus, the Son of the Creator."

   Jerome fully confirms this testimony of Irenæus, and says, "That when
   St. John was in Asia, where there arose the heresies of Ebion and
   Cerinthus, and others, who denied that Christ was come in the
   flesh--that is, denied his divine nature, whom he, in his Epistle,
   calls Antichrists, and St. Paul frequently condemns in his Epistles--he
   was forced by almost all the bishops of Asia, and the deputations of
   many other churches, to write more plainly concerning the divinity of
   our Saviour, and to soar aloft in a discourse on the Word, not more
   bold than happy."

   "It is related in ecclesiastical history, that John, when solicited by
   the brethren to write, answered, that he would not do it unless a
   public day of fasting and prayer was appointed to implore God's
   assistance; which being done, and the solemnity being honoured with a
   satisfactory revelation from God, he broke forth into these words, In
   the beginning was the Wordd," &c.

   Jerome in his book of Illustrious Men, says, "John wrote a gospel at
   the desire of the bishops of Asia, against Cerinthus, and other
   heretics, especially the doctrines of the Ebionites, then springing up,
   who say that Christ did not exist before the birth of Mary: for which
   reason he was obliged to declare his divine nativity. Another reason of
   his writing is also mentioned, which is, that after having read the
   volumes of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he expressed his approbation of
   their history as true: but observed, that they had recorded an account
   of but one year of our Lord's ministry, even the last after the
   imprisonment of John, (the Baptist) in which also he suffered. Omitting
   therefore that year, (in a great measure) the history of which had been
   written by the other three, he related the acts of the preceding time,
   before John was shut up in prison, as may appear to those who read the
   four evangelists, which may serve to account for the seeming difference
   between John and the rest."

   Augustine, in conformity with the account of Jerome, says, " That this
   evangelist wrote concerning the co-eternal divinity of Christ against
   heretics." Lampe has called in question these early testimonies
   respecting the occasion of writing this gospel, and has attempted to
   prove by argument that John had no view to any particular heretics, in
   the commencement of his gospel. Lardner has taken the same side, and
   adduces several arguments in favour of Lampe's opinion. Titman adopts
   the same opinion. But the probable reasonings of ingenious men when
   opposed to such a weight of ancient testimony, in relation to a matter
   of fact which occurred at no long distance before their time, deserve
   very little consideration. And, indeed, after reading Lardner's
   arguments, I must say that they appear to me to have no high degree of
   plausibility.

   That Cerinthus lived in the time of the apostle John, and was known to
   him, is evident from another testimony of Irenæus, which has been often
   quoted. It is a story which, he says, some persons in his time had from
   Polycarp, the disciple of John; which is as follows: "John going to a
   certain bath at Ephesus, and perceiving that Cerinthus, that noted
   arch-heretic, was in the bath, immediately leaped out, and said, Let us
   go home lest the bath should fall down upon us, having in it such a
   heretic as Cerinthus, that enemy of truth."

   For the testimony of Irenæus see remarks on the gospel of Matthew. To
   which we may here add the fanciful reason given by Irenæus why the
   number of gospels was four, and no more nor less. "Nor can there be
   more or fewer gospels than these. For as there are four regions of the
   world in which we live, and four cardinal winds, and the church is
   spread over all the earth, and the gospel is the pillar and support of
   the church, and the breath of life, in like manner it is fit it should
   have four pillars, breathing on all sides incorruption and refreshing
   mankind, whence it is manifest that the Logos, the maker of all things,
   who sits upon the cherubim, and holds together all things, having
   appeared to men, has given us a gospel four-fold in its form, but held
   together by one Spirit." [65]

   In another part of this work this Father gives characteristics of this
   gospel, thus--

   "The gospel according to John declares his princely, complete, and
   glorious generation from the Father, saying, In the beginning was the
   Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.'" [66]

   Augustine, moreover, asserts, "That John is the last of the
   evangelists." Chrysostom supposes, that John did not write his gospel
   till after the destruction of Jerusalem. Paulinus says, "It had been
   handed down by tradition, that John survived all the other apostles,
   and wrote the last of the four evangelists, and so as to confirm their
   most certain history." Again, he observes, "That in the beginning of
   John's gospel all heretics are confuted."

   Cosmas of Alexandria, informs us, "That when John dwelt at Ephesus,
   there were delivered to him by the faithful the writings of the other
   three evangelists. Receiving them, he said, that what they had written
   was well written; but some things were omitted by them which were
   needful to be related. And being desired by the faithful, he also
   published his writing, as a kind of supplement to the rest."

   Isidore of Seville, says, "That John wrote the last in Asia."
   Theophylact computed that John wrote about two and thirty years after
   Christ's ascension. Euthymius says, " That this gospel was not written
   until long after the destruction of Jerusalem." Nicephorus, "That John
   wrote last of all, about six and thirty years after our Lord's
   ascension to heaven." Having exhibited the testimonies of the ancients,
   it may not be amiss to set down the opinions of some of the moderns,
   relative to the time when this gospel was written.

   Mill, Fabricius, Le Clerc, Jones, and many others, agree that John
   wrote his gospel about the year of our Lord 97. Wetstein thinks it
   might have been written about thirty-two years after the ascension.
   Basnage and Lampe are inclined to believe that it was written before
   the destruction of Jerusalem. Whiston and Lardner adopt the same
   opinion. The gospel of John is cited by Clement of Rome; by Barnabas;
   by Ignatius; by Theophilus of Antioch; by Irenæus; and by Clement of
   Alexandria, in more than forty instances. And by all those writers who
   lived with, or immediately after the apostles, this gospel is appealed
   to as inspired Scripture; and the same is the fact in regard to Origen,
   Jerome, Augustine, and all the Fathers, who came after this period.
   Nearly the whole of this gospel could be made up from citations of the
   writers of the first four centuries. It was never excluded from any
   church, or any catalogue of the books of the New Testament, and
   therefore possesses every evidence of being canonical, which any
   reasonable man could demand.

   That the number of genuine gospels was four and no more, is evident
   from the testimony of all the Fathers who have spoken of them; and
   especially from the fanciful reason assigned by Irenæus to prove that
   there could be no more nor fewer. The same is manifest from the fact
   that Tatian, a learned disciple of Justin, who afterwards became the
   founder of a sect of ascetics, out of the four gospels formed a volume
   called Diatessaron. [67] In this, however, he left out such things as
   did not suit his views. But the existence of such a book which is
   attested by Irenaeus, Eusebius, Jerome and Theodoret, shows that the
   number of gospels commonly received by heretics, as well as catholics,
   was four and no more. The same might be proved from the writings of
   Julian the apostate.

SECTION IX.

   THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES--LUKE THE AUTHOR--CANONICAL AUTHORITY
   UNDISPUTED BY THE FATHERS--REJECTED ONLY BY HERETICS.

   THAT the Acts of the Apostles is the writing of Luke the evangelist, is
   manifest from the dedication to Theophilus, in which reference is made
   to his gospel, which was first written. And it is also evident from the
   uniform testimony of all antiquity; the fact never having been once
   questioned by any member of the catholic church. All that has been
   argued in vindication of the inspiration and canonical authority of
   Luke's gospel, is applicable to the Acts of the Apostles, and need not
   be here repeated.

   But it is pleasant to read the explicit testimonies of the Fathers to
   the sacred books of the New Testament: I will, therefore, bring forward
   the most important. Irenæus repeatedly cites passages from this book,
   saying, "Luke, the disciple and follower of Paul, says thus." "Luke,
   the inseparable companion and fellow labourer of Paul, wrote thus." He
   takes particular notice of Luke's using the first person plural, "we
   endeavoured--we came--we went--we sat down--we spoke," &c.; and enters
   into some discussion to prove "Luke's fitness for writing a just and
   true history."

   In another place he shows, "That Luke's Acts of the Apostles ought to
   be equally received with his gospel; for that in them he has carefully
   delivered to us the truth, and given to us a sure rule for salvation."
   Again he says, "Paul's account of his going to Jerusalem exactly agrees
   with Luke's in the Acts."

   Clemens Alexandrinus citing Paul's speech at Athens, introduces it
   thus, "So Luke in the Acts of the Apostles relates." Tertullian cites
   several passages out of the Acts of the Apostles which he calls,
   "Commentarius Lucæ, The Commentary of Luke." Origen ascribes the Acts
   of the Apostles to Luke. Eusebius says, "Luke has left us two inspired
   volumes, The Gospel and The Acts." Jerome expressly asserts, "That the
   Acts was the composition of Luke." The Syriac Version of the New
   Testament ascribes the Acts to Luke; and in some very ancient
   manuscripts of the New Testament his name is prefixed to this book.

   To this uniform body of ancient testimony there is nothing which can be
   objected, except that the author of the Synopsis, commonly ascribed to
   Athanasius, says, "Peter dictated the Acts of the Apostles, but Luke
   wrote them." But if this were true it would not in the least detract
   from the authority of the book, but rather increase it. One testimony,
   however, can be of no avail against so many; and we know that Luke knew
   most of the facts recorded in this book by his own personal
   observation, and needed no one to dictate them to him. Besides, Peter
   was not an eye-witness of the greater number of the facts related in
   this book.

   The time when the Acts of the Apostles was written may be determined
   pretty accurately, by the time when the history which it contains
   terminates; that is about A. D. 62; for no doubt he began to write soon
   after he left Rome.

   That the Acts of the Apostles is of canonical authority, is proved from
   its having a place in all the ancient catalogues of the books of the
   New Testament. The same is evinced by the numerous citations from this
   book by the early Fathers, who explicitly appeal to it as of divine
   authority--as an inspired book. It is plainly referred to in more
   instances than one by Clement of Rome, the fellow-labourer of Paul.
   Polycarp the disciple of John also cites a passage from the Acts, in
   his Epistle to the Philippians. It is cited by Justin Martyr in his
   Exhortation to the Greeks. It is distinctly cited by Irenæus more than
   thirty times, in some of which instances it is expressly called
   Scripture; and the credit and authority of the book are largely
   discussed in his work against heretics.

   The citations of Tertullian from this book are too numerous to be
   particularized. He also quotes it expressly under the name of
   Scripture; "Which part of Scripture," says he, "they who do not
   receive, must deny the descent of the Holy Ghost, and be ignorant of
   the infant state of the Christian church." [68]

   This book was also constantly read as Scripture in the weekly
   assemblies of Christians all over the world. From the testimonies
   adduced above it will appear, with convincing evidence, how unfounded
   is the opinion of some learned men, that the Acts in the early period
   of the church was very little known comparatively, and very little
   esteemed. This opinion has been favoured by such men as Father Simon
   and Dr. Mill; and has no other foundation than a passage in the
   Prolegomena to the Acts, ascribed to Chrysostom, the genuineness of
   which is very doubtful. But if Chrysostom was the author of this
   passage, how little can it weigh against such a host of witnesses? The
   passage referred to is, "This book is not so much as known to many;
   they know neither the book nor by whom it was written." Now the same
   might be asserted respecting all the books in the Canon. There are many
   persons ignorant of what they contain and unacquainted with their
   object. But there is no need to dwell longer on this objection.

   The Acts of the Apostles, therefore, has an indisputable claim to a
   place in the sacred Canon. No better or stronger evidence can be
   desired. It is true that some of the earliest heretics did not receive
   this book as canonical. Tertullian informs us that it was rejected by
   Cerdo, the master of Marcion, and some others whom he does not name,
   but whom he refutes.

   Philastriuss informs us that the Cerinthians did not receive this book.
   And Augustine tells us, that the Manichees did not, because they
   considered Manes to be the Paraclete, promised by the Saviour; but in
   the Acts, it is declared to have been the Holy Ghost which descended on
   the apostles on the day of Pentecost.

   "But," says Father Simon, "let us leave these enthusiasts, who had no
   other reason for rejecting the books received by the whole church,
   except that they did not suit with the idea which they had formed of
   the Christian religion."

SECTION X.

   TESTIMONIES TO THE CANONICAL AUTHORITY OF THE FOURTEEN EPISTLES OF
   PAUL.

   ON the subject of Paul's epistles, there is a universal consent among
   the ancients, except as it relates to the epistle to the Hebrews; which
   having been published without the apostle's name and usual salutation,
   many conjectured that it was the production of another person; and
   while some ascribed it to Barnabas, others thought that either Clement
   or Luke was the writer. There seems to have been a difference between
   the eastern and western churches on this subject; for the Greeks appear
   to have entertained no doubts in regard to Paul's being the author of
   this epistle: it was only among the Latins that its genuineness was a
   matter of uncertainty. And the most learned among these adopted the
   opinion, that it was the production of Paul; and by degrees its
   authority was fully established in the west as well as the east. The
   true state of the case will, however, appear more clearly by citing the
   testimonies of the Fathers, than by any general representation.

   Although Clement, the fellow-labourer of Paul, frequently cites
   passages from the gospels and epistles, yet he never expressly mentions
   any book of the New Testament, except Paul's first epistle to the
   Corinthians; to whom also Clement's epistle was addressed. His words
   are, "Take into your hands the epistle of blessed Paul the apostle.
   What did he at first write to you in the beginning of the gospel?
   Verily he did by the Spirit admonish you concerning himself, and Cephas
   and Apollos, because that even then you did form parties." There are in
   this epistle of Clement many other passages in which the words of Paul
   are cited, but this is the only one in which his name is mentioned.

   Hermass and Ignatius also often quote the words of Paul's epistles, but
   the books from which they are taken are not designated.

   Polycarp, the disciple of the apostle John and bishop of Smyrna, who
   suffered martyrdom in extreme old age, about the middle of the second
   century, after sentence of death was pronounced upon him, wrote an
   epistle to the Philippians, in which he makes express mention of Paul's
   first epistle to the Corinthians--"Do ye not know that the saints shall
   judge the world, as Paul teaches?" See 1 Cor. vi. 22.

   He also quotes a passage from the epistle to the Ephesians, under the
   name of Holy Scripture. "For I trust," says he, "that ye are well
   exercised in the Holy Scripture--as in these Scriptures it is said, Be
   ye angry and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.'" Ephes.
   iv. 26. Polycarp also cites passages from the second epistle to the
   Corinthians; from the epistle to the Galatians; from the first and
   second to the Thessalonians; from the epistle to the Hebrews; and from
   both the epistles to Timothy; but, as is usual with the apostolical
   Fathers, he does not refer to the books or authors from which he makes
   his citations.

   Justin Martyr quotes many passages in the very words of Paul, without
   mentioning his name. But Irenæus distinctly and frequently quotes
   thirteen of Paul's epistles. He takes nothing, indeed, from the short
   epistle to Philemon, which can easily be accounted for by the brevity
   of this letter, and the special object which the apostle had in view in
   penning it.

   It would fill a large space to put down all the passages cited by
   Irenaeus from the epistles of Paul. Let it suffice to give one from
   each as quoted in his work "Against Heresies."--"This same thing Paul
   has explained writing to the Romans, Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ,
   separated to the gospel of God.' Rom. i. 11. And again writing to the
   Romans concerning Israel, he says, Whose are the fathers and of whom
   concerning the flesh, Christ came who is God over all, blessed for
   evermore.'" Rom. ix. 5. "This also Paul manifestly shows in his epistle
   to the Corinthians, saying, Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye
   should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud.' 1
   Cor. x. 1. Paul in his second epistle to the Corinthians, says, In whom
   the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that believe not.'"
   2 Cor. iv. 4. "The apostle Paul says, in his epistle to the Galatians,
   Wherefore then serveth the law of works? It was added until the seed
   should come to whom the promise was made.'" Gal. iii. 10. "As also the
   blessed Paul says, in his epistle to the Ephesians, For we are members
   of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.'" Eph. v. 30. "As also
   Paul says to the Philippians, I am full, having received of
   Epaphroditus, the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet
   smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.'" Phil. iv. 13.
   "Again Paul says, in his epistle to the Colossians, Luke the beloved
   physician saluteth you.'" Col. iv. 14. "The apostle in the first
   epistle to the Thessalonians, says, And the God of peace sanctify you
   wholly.'" 1 Thess. v. 23. "And again, in the second epistle to the
   Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, he says, And then shall that
   wicked one be revealed.'" 2 Thess. ii. 8. In the beginning of his work
   against heresies, he says, "Whereas some having rejected the truth,
   bringing in lying words, and vain genealogies, rather than godly
   edifying, which is in faith,' 1 Tim. i. 4, as saith the apostle." This
   epistle is often quoted by Irenseus, in the work above mentioned.
   Speaking of Linus bishop of Rome, he says, "Of this Linus, Paul makes
   mention in his epistle to Timothy, Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens,
   and Linus.'" 2 Tim. iv. 21. "As Paul says, A man that is an heretic
   after the first and second admonition, reject.'" Tit. iii. 10. Thus, we
   have seen that Irenæus who lived in the age immediately succeeding that
   in which Paul lived and wrote, has borne explicit testimony to all the
   epistles of that apostle which have his name prefixed, except the short
   epistle to Philemon, from which it is probable he had no occasion to
   take any authorities, as it is very concise, and addressed to a friend
   on a particular subject in which Paul felt deeply interested.

   As to the epistle to the Hebrews, which is anonymous, there is ample
   evidence that Irenæus was acquainted with it; but it is doubtful
   whether he esteemed it to be the production of Paul, or some other
   person. As he resided in France, it is very possible that he
   participated in the prejudice of the western church on this point.
   Eusebius informs us, that he had seen a work of Irenæus which has not
   reached our times, in which he cites passages from the epistle to the
   Hebrews; but he does not say that he quoted them as Paul's. And in his
   works, which are still extant, there are several passages cited from
   this epistle, but without direct reference to the source whence they
   were derived.

   Athenagoras quotes from several of Paul's epistles; but, as has been
   seen to be the custom of the early Fathers, he commonly uses the words,
   without informing the reader, from what author they were borrowed.
   There is, however, a passage in which he refers to both the first and
   second epistles to the Corinthians, as being the production of the
   apostle Paul. "It is manifest, therefore," says he, "that according to
   the apostle, this corruptible and dissipated must put on incorruption,
   that the dead being raised up, and the separated and even consumed
   parts being again united, every one may receive justly, the things he
   hath done in the body, whether they be good or bad.'" 1 Cor. xv. 54; 2
   Cor. v. 10.

   Clement, of Alexandria, abounds in quotations from Paul's epistles; a
   few of which will be sufficient for our purpose. "The apostle, in the
   epistle to the Romans, says, Behold, therefore, the goodness and
   severity of God.'" "The blessed Paul, in the first epistle to the
   Corinthians, says, Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit,
   in malice, be ye children, but in understanding be ye men.'" 1 Cor.
   xiv. 20. He has also many quotations from the second to the
   Corinthians--"The apostle," says he, calls the common doctrine of the
   faith, a savour of knowledge,' in the second to the Corinthians." 2
   Cor. ii. 144. "Hence, also, Paul says, Having these promises, dearly
   beloved, let us cleanse our hearts from all filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness, in the fear of God.'" 2 Cor. vii. 1.
   "Whereupon Paul, also writing to the Galatians, says, My little
   children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in
   you.'" Gal. iv. 19. "Whereupon the blessed apostle says, I testify in
   the Lord that ye walk not as other Gentiles walk.' Eph. iv. 17, 18.
   Again, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.'" Eph.
   v. 21. He quotes part of the first and second chapters of the epistle
   to the Philippians expressly; and in another place he quotes the same
   epistle, after this manner: "The apostle of the Lord also exhorting the
   Macedonians, says,'the Lord is at hand, take heed that we be not found
   empty.'" Philip. iv. 55.

   Clement also quotes the epistle to the Colossians, and the epistles to
   the Thessalonians. From the first epistle to Timothy he cites this
   passage, "O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust,
   avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science,
   falsely so called, which some professing, have erred concerning the
   faith." 1 Tim. vi. 20, 21. On which he observes, "Heretics confuted by
   this saying, reject both epistles to Timothy." The epistle to Titus is
   also quoted several times; and he remarks, in one place, "that Paul had
   cited Epimenides, the Cretan, in his epistle to Titus, after this
   manner, One of themselves, a poet of their own, said, the Cretans are
   always liars.'" Tit. i. 12, 13. The epistle to the Hebrews is also
   distinctly quoted, and is ascribed to Paul as its author. "Wherefore,
   writing to the Hebrews, who were declining from the faith to the law,
   Paul says, Have ye need that any teach you again, which be the first
   principles of the oracles of God, and are become such, as have need of
   milk, and not of strong meat.'" Heb. v. 12.

   Tertullian frequently, and expressly quotes most of Paul's epistles. In
   one place he says, "I will, therefore, by no means say, God, nor Lord,
   but I will follow the apostles; so that if the Father and the Son are
   mentioned together, I will say, God the Father, and Jesus Christ the
   Lord. But when I mention Christ only, I will call him God, as the
   apostle does, Of whom Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for
   ever.'" Rom. ix. 5. "Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians,
   speaks of those who doubted, or denied the resurrection." In his
   Treatise on Monogamy, he computes that it was about one hundred and
   sixty years from Paul's writing this epistle, to the time when he
   wrote. "In the second epistle to the Corinthians, they suppose the
   apostle Paul to have forgiven the same fornicator, who in the first, he
   declared, ought to be delivered to Satan for the destruction of the
   flesh." "But of this, no more need be said, if it be the same Paul,
   who, writing to the Galatians, reckons heresy among the works of the
   flesh; and who directs Titus to reject a man that is a heretic, after
   the first admonition, knowing that hc that is such is subverted and
   sinneth, being condemned of himself.'" "I pass," says he, "to another
   epistle, which we have inscribed to the Ephesians; but the heretics, to
   the Laodiceans." Again, "According to the true testimony of the church,
   we suppose this epistle to have been sent to the Ephesians, and not to
   the Laodiceans; but Marcion has endeavoured to alter this inscription,
   upon pretence of having made a more diligent search into this matter.
   But the inscriptions are of no importance, for the apostle wrote to
   all, when he wrote to some."

   Speaking of the Christian's hope, he says, "Of which hope and
   expectation, Paul to the Galatians says, For we through the Spirit wait
   for the hope of righteousness by faith.' He does not say we have
   obtained it, but he speaks of the hope of the righteousness of God in
   the day of judgment, when our reward shall be decided. Of which being
   in suspense, when le wrote to the Philippians, he said, If by any
   means, I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead; not as though
   I had already attained, or were already perfect.' Phil. iii. 11, 12.
   The apostle, writing to the Colossians, expressly cautions against
   philosophy, Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
   deceit, after the tradition of men, and not after the instruction of
   the Spirit.'" Col. ii. 8. "And in the epistle to the Thessalonians, the
   apostle adds, But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no
   need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly, that the day
   of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.'" 1 Thess. v. 1-3. "And
   in his second epistle to the same persons, he writes with greater
   solicitude: But I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled.' 2
   Thess. ii. 1, 2. "And this word, Paul has used in writing to Timothy, O
   Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust.'" 1 Tim. vi. 20.

   That remarkable passage of Tertullian, in which he is supposed to refer
   to the existing autographs of the epistles of Paul, although referred
   to already, may with propriety be here introduced. "Well," says he, "if
   you be willing to exercise your curiosity profitably, in the business
   of your salvation, visit the apostolical churches, in which the very
   chairs of the apostles still preside, in which their very authentic
   letters (authentiæ literæ) are recited, sending forth the voice, and
   representing the countenance of each one of them. Is Achaia near you?
   You have Corinth. If you are not far from Macedonia, you have
   Philippi--you have Thessalonica. If you can go to Asia, you have
   Ephesus. But if you are near to Italy, you have Rome, from whence also
   we may be easily satisfied."

   There are three opinions respecting the meaning of this phrase
   authenticæ literæ; authentic letters; The first is, that it signifies
   the original manuscripts of the apostles--the autographs which were
   sent severally to the churches named, to all of which Paul addressed
   epistles. The second opinion is, that Tertullian meant to refer his
   readers to the original Greek of these epistles, which they had been
   accustomed to read in a Latin version. And the third is, that this
   phrase means well authenticated letters; epistles which, by application
   to these churches, could be proved to be genuine writings of the
   apostles.

   Now, that the first of these is the true sense of Tertullian's words,
   will, I think, appear very probable, if we consider, that if those
   autographs were preserved, even with common care, they would have been
   extant in the time of Tertullian, who reckons only 160 years from the
   time of Paul's writing to his own time. And again, unless he meant
   this, there is no reason why he should direct his readers only to those
   cities which had received epistles; for doubtless many other churches,
   which might be more accessible, had authentic copies in the Greek
   language. Such copies undoubtedly existed in Africa, where Tertullian
   lived. They need not, however, have been directed to go to Rome, or
   Corinth, or Ephesus, or Philippi, or Thessalonica, to see the epistles
   of Paul in Greek. Neither was it necessary to take a journey to these
   cities to be fully convinced, that the letters which had been received
   by them were genuine; for the evidence of this fact was not confined to
   these distinguished places, but was diffused all over the Christian
   world.

   From these considerations I conclude, that in Tertullian's time these
   churches had in possession, and preserved with care, the identical
   epistles sent to them by Paul. This sense is confirmed by what he says,
   of their being able to hear the voice, and behold the countenance of
   the apostles, and see the very seats on which they had been accustomed
   to sit when they presided in the church. These seats were still
   occupied by the bishops, and seemed to preside, as they were venerable
   from having been once occupied by the apostles.

   Tertullian was acquainted with the epistle to the Hebrews, for he
   quotes several passages from the sixth chapter, but he ascribes it to
   Barnabas, and not to Paul. In this opinion, I believe, he is singular.

   Theophilus of Antioch quotes the following passage from the epistle to
   the Romans, but seems to have quoted from memory, "He will search out
   all things, and will judge justly; rendering to all according to the
   desert of their actions. To them that by patient continuance in
   well-doing seek for immortality, he will give eternal life, joy, peace,
   rest, and many good things, which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard,
   nor have entered into the heart of man. But to the unbelieving, and the
   despisers, and them that obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
   shall be wrath and indignation, tribulation and anguish; and in a word,
   eternal fire shall be the portion of such." This passage is evidently
   taken from Rom. ii. 6-9, and as evidently cited from memory. It also
   contains a quotation from 1 Cor. ii. 9.

   This early and learned Father has also cited, in the same loose manner,
   passages from the epistles to the Ephesians--to the Philippians--to the
   Colossians--to Timothy--to Titus--and from the epistle to the Hebrews,
   but without naming the book from which the passages are taken; which is
   in accordance with the practice of all the apostolic Fathers.

   The following passage is worthy of notice, not only because it contains
   an undoubted reference to the second epistle of Peter; but because it
   shows what opinion was in that early age entertained of the inspiration
   of the sacred Scriptures: "But men of God, filled with the Holy Ghost,
   and becoming prophets, inspired by God himself, and being enlightened
   were taught of God, and were holy and righteous, wherefore Clement.
   they obtained the honour to become the organs of God." [69]

   Clement of Alexandria lived and wrote toward the close of the second
   century. After Pantænus he was president of the Alexandrian school.
   Several of his works have come down to us, from which the following
   citations from Paul's epistles are taken. "Behold, therefore," saith
   Paul, "the goodness and severity of God." Rom. xvi. 19. "The blessed
   Paul, in the first epistle to the Corinthians, says, Brethren, be not
   children in understanding, but in malice be ye children, but in
   understanding be ye men.' And he says, the apostle in the second
   epistle to the Corinthians, calls the gospel "a savour of knowledge," 2
   Cor. xi. 14. "Again, Paul says, Having these promises, dearly beloved,
   let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
   perfecting holiness in the fear of God.' 2 Cor. vii. 1. He cites the
   following from the epistle to the Ephesians: "As blessed Paul saith,
   Walk not as other Gentiles walk.' Ephes. vi. 17, and submitting
   yourselves one to another in the fear of God." Eph. v. 21. He also
   cites the following words from the epistle to the Galatians, "My little
   children, of whom I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you."
   Gal. iv. 19. And from the Philippians, these words, "Not as though I
   had already attained or were already perfect," Phil. iii. 12. He also
   cites texts frequently from the epistles to the Colossians and
   Thessalonians, and always quotes them as written by Paul. From the
   first epistle to Timothy, vi. 20, he has the following, "O Timothy,
   keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane babblings,
   and oppositions of science, falsely so called." He also refers to the
   second epistle to Timothy, and the epistle to Titus he quotes several
   times. It is satisfactory to have the testimony of so early and so
   learned a Father in favour of the canonical authority of the epistle to
   the Hebrews, and of its having Paul as its author. "Blessed Paul,
   writing to such as were declining, says, Ye have need that one teach
   you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and are
   become such as have need of milk and not strong meat.'" Heb. v. 12.

   Origen quotes Paul's epistles, as expressly and frequently as is done
   by almost any modern writer. To transcribe all the passages cited by
   him, would be to put down a large portion of the writings of this
   apostle. A few instances will be sufficient.

   In one passage, in his work against Celsus, he mentions several of
   Paul's epistles together, in the following manner--"Do you, first of
   all, explain the epistles of him who says these things, and having
   diligently read, and attended to the sense of the words there used,
   particularly in that to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the
   Philippians, to the Romans, &c." The epistle to the Ephesians is
   elsewhere quoted by Origen with the inscription which it now bears.

   After employing an argument founded on a passage quoted from the
   epistle to the Hebrews, he observes: "But possibly some one, pressed
   with this argument, will take refuge in the opinion of those who reject
   this epistle as not written by Paul. In answer to such we intend to
   write a distinct discourse, to prove this to be an epistle of Paul." In
   his citations of this epistle, therefore, he constantly ascribes it to
   Paul in such expressions as these, "Paul, in his epistle to the
   Hebrews," "In the epistle to the Hebrews, the same Paul says."

   But Origen not only expresses his own opinion on this subject, but
   asserts, that by the tradition received by the ancients it was ascribed
   to Paul. His words are, "For it is not without reason that the ancients
   have handed it down to us as Paul's." Now, when we take into view that
   Origen lived within one hundred years of the time of the apostles, and
   that he was a person of most extraordinary learning, and that he had
   travelled much through different countries, his testimony on this point
   is of great weight; especially, since his opinion is founded on the
   testimony of the ancients, by whom he must mean the contemporaries of
   the apostles. At the same time, however, he mentions, that some
   ascribed it to Luke, and others to Clement of Rome.

   Cyprian often quotes the epistles of Paul. "According," says he, "to
   what the blessed apostle wrote in his epistle to the Romans, Every one
   shall give account of himself to God, therefore, let us not judge one
   another.'" Rom. xiv. 12. In his first book of Testimonies, he says, "In
   the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, it is said, Moreover,
   brethren, I would not ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers
   were baptized unto Moses, in the cloud, and in the sea.' 1 Cor. x. 1.
   Likewise, in the second epistle to the Corinthians, it is written,
   Their minds were blinded unto this day.' 2 Cor. iii. 15. In like
   manner, blessed Paul, by the inspiration of the Lord, says, Now he that
   ministereth seed to the sower, minister bread for your food, and
   multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
   that ye may be enriched in all things.' 2 Cor. ix. 10. Likewise Paul to
   the Galatians says, When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth
   his Son, made of a woman.'" Gal. iv. 4.

   Cyprian expressly quotes the epistle to the Ephesians under that title.
   "But the apostle Paul, speaking of the same thing more clearly and
   plainly, writes to the Ephesians, and says, Christ loved the church,
   and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, with
   the washing of water.' Ephes. v. 25, 26. So also, Paul to the
   Philippians says, Who being appointed in the form of God, did not
   earnestly affect to be equal with God, but made himself of no
   reputation, taking on him the form of a servant; and being made in the
   likeness of man, and found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
   becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.' Philip. ii.
   6-8. In the epistle of Paul to the Colossians, it is written, Continue
   in prayer, watching in the same.' Col. iv. 2. Likewise, the blessed
   apostle Paul, full of the Holy Ghost, sent to call and convert the
   Gentiles, warns and teaches, Beware lest any man spoil you through
   philosophy, &c.'" Col. ii. 8. He also quotes both the epistles to the
   Thessalonians. In his book of Testimonies he says, "If the apostle Paul
   writing to Timothy, said, Let no man despise thy youth,' 1 Tim. iv. 12,
   much more may it be said of you and your colleagues, Let no man despise
   thy age.'" "Therefore the apostle writes to Timothy and exhorts, that a
   bishop should not strive, but be gentle, and apt to teach.'" 2 Tim. ii.
   24. These two epistles are elsewhere quoted distinctly, as the first
   and second to Timothy. He also quotes from the epistle to Titus, the
   passage, "A man that is an heretic after the first and second
   admonition reject." Tit. iii. 10.

   Cyprian no where quotes the epistle to the Hebrews. It is probable,
   therefore, that he, like some others of the Latin Fathers, did not
   believe it to be Paul's, or was doubtful respecting it. Neither does he
   cite the epistle to Philemon; of this no other reason need be sought,
   but its contents and brevity. How many Christian authors have written
   volumes, without any citation of that epistle! Victorinus, who lived
   near the close of the third century, often quotes Paul's Epistles; and
   among the rest, he cites the epistle to the Hebrews, which he seems to
   have believed to be the production of Paul. Dionysius of Alexandria,
   also a contemporary of Origen, and a man of great learning, in the few
   fragments of his works which remain, often refers to Paul's Epistles.
   Novatus, presbyter of the church of Rome, who flourished about the
   middle of the third century, expressly cites from the epistle to the
   Romans, that famous testimony to Christ's divinity, so often quoted by
   the Fathers, "Whose are the fathers, of whom is Christ according to the
   flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever." And it deserves to be
   recollected, that although so many, beginning with Irenaeus, have cited
   this passage, yet none of them appear to have thought the words capable
   of any other meaning, than the plain obvious sense, which strikes the
   reader at first. That it was a mere exclamation of praise, seems never
   to have entered their minds. Novatus also quotes the first and second
   epistles to the Corinthians, the epistles to the Galatians, to the
   Ephesians, and to the Philippians. From this last epistle he cites
   these remarkable words: "Who being in the form of God," Phil. ii. 6,
   and interprets the following clause in exact accordance with another of
   the Fathers, "did not earnestly seek to be like God, or to be equal
   with God." He quotes from the epistle to the Colossians these words:
   "Whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers,
   things visible and invisible, by him all things consist." Col. i. 16,
   17. The epistles to Timothy and to Titus are also cited by this author.

   Methodius, who lived in the latter part of the third century, quotes
   Paul's epistle to the Romans, first and second to the Corinthians, to
   the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians,
   the first to the Thessalonians, and the first to Timothy. He has also
   taken several passages from the epistle to the Hebrews, and quotes it
   in such a manner, as to render it highly probable that he esteemed it
   to be a part of sacred Scripture, and ascribed it to Paul.

   Eusebius, the learned historian, undoubtedly received thirteen epistles
   of Paul as genuine; and he seems to have entertained no doubt
   respecting the canonical authority of the epistle to the Hebrews; but
   he sometimes expresses himself doubtfully of its author, while at other
   times he quotes it as Paul's, without any apparent hesitation. In
   speaking of the universally acknowledged epistle of Clement of Rome, he
   observes: "In which, inserting many sentiments of the epistle to the
   Hebrews, and also using some of the very words of it, he plainly
   manifests that epistle to be no modern writing. And hence it has, not
   without reason, been reckoned among the other writings of the apostle;
   for Paul having written to the Hebrews in their own language, some
   think that the Evangelist Luke, others, that this very Clement
   translated it; which last is the more probable of the two, there being
   a resemblance between the style of the epistle of Clement, and that to
   the Hebrews; nor are the sentiments of these two writings very
   different." In his Ecclesiastical History, he speaks, "of the epistle
   to the Hebrews, and divers other epistles of Paul." And Theodoret
   positively asserts, that Eusebius received this epistle as Paul's, and
   that he manifested that all the ancients, almost, were of the same
   opinion. It seems, from these facts, that in the time of Eusebius, the
   churches with which he was acquainted, did generally receive the
   epistle to the Hebrews as the writing of Paul.

   Ambrose, bishop of Milan, received fourteen epistles of Paul. Jerome
   received as undoubted all Paul's epistles, except that to the Hebrews,
   concerning which he says in his letter to Evangelius, "That all the
   Greeks and some of the Latins received this epistle." And in his letter
   to Dardanus, "That it was not only received as Paul's by all the
   churches of the east, in his time, but by all the ecclesiastical
   writers in former times, though many ascribe it to Barnabas, or
   Clement." He also says, "that it was daily read in the churches; and if
   the Latins did not receive this epistle, as the Greeks rejected the
   Revelation of John, he received both; not being so much influenced by
   present times, as by the judgment of ancient writers, who quote both;
   and that not as they quote apocryphal books, and even heathen writings,
   but as canonical and ecclesiastical."

   Jerome, in speaking of the writings of Paul, gives the following very
   full and satisfactory testimony: "He wrote," says he, "nine epistles to
   seven churches. To the Romans, one; to the Corinthians, two; to the
   Galatians, one; to the Philippians, one; to the Colossians, one; to the
   Thessalonians, two; to the Ephesians, one; to Timothy, two; to Titus,
   one; to Philemon, one. But the epistle called to the Hebrews is not
   thought to be his, because of the difference of argument and style; but
   rather Barnabas's, as Tertullian thought; or Luke's, according to some
   others; or Clement's, who was afterwards bishop of Rome; who being much
   with Paul, clothed and adorned Paul's sense in his own language. Or if
   it be Paul's, he might decline putting his name to it in the
   inscription, for fear of offending the Jews. Moreover, he wrote as a
   Hebrew to the Hebrews, it being his own language; whence it came to
   pass, that being translated, it has more elegance in the Greek than his
   other epistles. This they say is the reason of its differing from
   Paul's other writings. There is also an epistle to the Laodiceans, but
   it is rejected by every body." Jerome commonly quotes the epistle to
   the Hebrews as the apostle Paul's; and, as we have seen before, this
   was his prevailing opinion, which is not contradicted in the long
   passage just cited.

   Augustine received fourteen epistles of Paul, the last of which, in his
   catalogue, is the epistle to the Hebrews; he was aware, however, that
   some in his time thought it of doubtful authority. "However," says he,
   "I am inclined to follow the opinion of the churches of the east, who
   receive it among the canonical Scriptures."

   The time when each of these epistles was written cannot be ascertained
   with any exactness. It is not even agreed among the learned which was
   the first of Paul's epistles. Generally, indeed, it has been thought
   that the two epistles to the Thessalonians were composed earlier than
   the others; but of late some learned men have given precedence to the
   epistle to the Galatians. And this opinion is not altogether confined
   to the moderns, for Tertullian mentions this epistle as among the first
   of Paul's writings. But the more common opinion is, that it was written
   during the long abode of this apostle at Corinth. Among the advocates
   of this opinion, we find L'Enfant, Beausobre, Lardner, &c., while
   Grotius, Capel, Witsius, and Wall, suppose that it was written at
   Ephesus. These last, together with Fabricius and Mill, place the date
   of the epistle to the Galatians, after that to the Romans. Macknight
   maintains that it was written from Antioch, after the Council of
   Jerusalem; and offers in support of his opinions several plausible
   arguments, which, if they do not prove all that he wishes, seem to
   render it probable that the time of this epistle being written was soon
   after the Council of Jerusalem. Semler, however, is of opinion that
   this epistle was written prior to the Council of Jerusalem.

   From these various opinions, it is sufficiently evident that the
   precise date of the epistle to the Galatians cannot be ascertained. If
   we take the opinion of those who give the earliest date, the time of
   writing will not be later than A. D. 47. But if we receive as more
   probable the opinions of those who think that it was written after the
   Council of Jerusalem, we shall bring it down to the year 50; while,
   according to the opinion more commonly adopted, its date will be A. D.
   52 or 53. And if we prefer the opinions of those who assign the latest
   date to this epistle, we shall bring it down several years later, and
   instead of giving it the first place, will give it the ninth or tenth.

   There seem to be better data for determining that the first epistle to
   the Thessalonians was written from Corinth, about the year 51; and the
   second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably written a few months
   afterwards from the same place. Michaelis and Dr. Hales unite in giving
   the next place in the order of time to the epistle to Titus. Lardner,
   however, places it considerably later; and Paley assigns to it a date
   later than any other author. On this subject there is little else than
   conjecture to guide us. The year in which this epistle was written,
   according to Michaelis and Hales, was 53; according to Lardner, 56;
   according to Barrington, 57; and according to Whitby, Pearson, and
   Paley, 65.

   The epistle next in order is the first to the Corinthians, the date of
   which can be determined with considerable precision from the epistle
   itself. "I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost." 1 Cor. xvi. 8. These
   words teach where this epistle was written, and by a comparison with
   other passages of Scripture, that it was penned near the close of
   Paul's long residence at Ephesus, from which place he departed about A.
   D. 57. This then is the proper date of this epistle.

   The first epistle to Timothy will stand next, if we follow the opinion
   most commonly entertained by learned men; and its date will be A. D. 57
   or A. D. 58. This opinion is supported by the authority of Athanasius,
   Theodoret, Baronius, Capellus, Blondel, Hammond, Grotius, Salmasius,
   Lightfoot, Benson, Barrington, Michaelis, Doddridge, and others. But
   Pearson, Rosenmuller, Macknight, Paley, Tomline, &c., place it as low
   as the year of our Lord 64 or 65.

   The second epistle to the Corinthians was written probably about a year
   after the first, which will bring it to A. D. 58.

   In the same year it is thought that Paul wrote his very important
   epistle to the Romans. On this point, however, there is some diversity
   of opinion. But the epistle itself contains internal evidence that it
   was written at Corinth, when the apostle was preparing to take the
   contributions of the churches to Jerusalem.

   The date of the epistles to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, and to
   the Colossians, can be ascertained pretty nearly, from the
   circumstance, that Paul was prisoner at Rome when they were written.
   The epistle to the Ephesians may, with much probability, be referred to
   A. D. 61; the epistle to the Philipplans to A. D. 62; and the epistle
   to the Colossians to the same year.

   The short epistle to Philemon was written, as appears by several
   coincidences, about the same time as those just mentioned.

   The epistle to the Hebrews seems to have been written about the
   termination of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome. Its date, therefore,
   may without danger of mistake be referred to A. D. 62 or A. D. 63.

   J. D. Michaelis who, as has been seen, has done much to unsettle the
   Canon of Scripture, by calling in question the genuineness of some of
   the books, as well as the inspiration of some of the writers, has, in
   an elaborate essay, (vol. iv.) endeavoured to lessen the authority of
   this epistle. For an answer to the arguments of this learned, but
   sceptical Professor, I would refer the reader to Townsend's New
   Testament, arranged in chronological and historical order.

   Paul's second epistle to Timothy seems to have been written during his
   second imprisonment at Rome, and shortly before his death, A. D. 66.

SECTION XI.

   CANONICAL AUTHORITY OF THE SEVEN CATHOLIC EPISTLES.

   THE first epistle of Peter, and the first of John, are quoted by
   Ignatius, Polycarp and Papias, but not expressly as the writings of
   these apostles. For the particular passages cited the reader is
   referred to Lardner. Justin Martyr has a saying which is nowhere found
   in Scripture; except in the second of Peter: it is, "that a day of the
   Lord is a thousand years." Diognetus quotes several passages from the
   first of Peter, and the first of John. Irenæus quotes the first epistle
   of Peter expressly; "And Peter says, in his epistle, Whom having not
   seen ye love." And from the second he takes the same passage which has
   just been cited, as quoted by Justin Martyr. The first and second of
   John are expressly quoted by this Father, for after citing his gospel
   he goes on to say, "Wherefore also in his epistle, he says, Little
   children, it is the last time." And again, "In the forementioned
   epistle the Lord commands us to shun those persons who bring false
   doctrine, saying, "Many deceivers are entered into the world, who
   confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver,
   and an Antichrist. Look to yourselves that ye lose not those things
   which ye have wrought." Now these words are undoubtedly taken from
   John's second epistle. Irenæus seems, indeed, to quote them from the
   first, but this was probably a slip of the memory.

   Several passages out of the epistle of James are also cited by this
   father, but without any distinct reference to the source whence they
   are derived. Athenagoras also has some quotations which appear to be
   from James and 2 Peter. Clement of Alexandria often quotes 1 Peter, and
   sometimes 2 Peter. The first epistle of John is often cited by him.
   Jude also is quoted several times expressly, as, "Of these and the like
   heretics, I think Jude spoke prophetically, when he said, I will that
   ye should know, that God having saved the people out of Egypt,'" &c. He
   has a remark on Jude's modesty, that he did not style himself the
   brother of our Lord, although he was related to him, but begins his
   epistle, "Jude the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James."

   Tertullian often quotes the first epistle of John; but he has in none
   of his remaining writings cited anything from James, 2 Peter or 2 John.
   He has, however, one express quotation from Jude, "Hence it is," says
   he, "that Enoch is quoted by the apostle Jude."

   Origen, in his commentary on John's gospel, expressly quotes the
   epistle of James in the following passage, "For though it be called
   faith, if it be without works, it is dead, as we read in the epistle
   ascribed to James." This is the only passage in the remaining Greek
   works of this father where this book is quoted; but in his Latin works,
   translated by Rufin, it is cited as the epistle of James the apostle
   and brother of our Lord; and as "divine Scripture," The first epistle
   of Peter is often quoted expressly. In his book against Celsus, he
   says, "As it is said by Peter, Ye as lively stones are built up a
   spiritual house.' Again, Peter in his Catholic epistle, says, Put to
   death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit.'" According to
   Eusebius, Origen considered the second of Peter as doubtful, and in his
   Greek works there are no clear citations from it; but there are found a
   few in his Latin works. In the passage preserved by Eusebius, he says,
   that some were doubtful respecting the second and third of John, "but
   for my part," says he, "let them be granted to be his."

   Origen has cited several passages from Jude, which are found in no
   other part of Scripture; and in one place remarks, "Jude wrote an
   epistle of few lines indeed, but full of powerful words and heavenly
   grace, who at the beginning, says, Jude the servant of Jesus Christ,
   and brother of James.'" In another place, he shows, that some were
   doubtful of this epistle, for he says, "But if any one receives also
   the epistle of Jude, let him consider what will follow, from what is
   there said." This epistle is cited in his Latin works also; and several
   times in a Latin epistle ascribed to Origen.

   Cyprian nowhere quotes the epistle of James; but the first of Peter is
   often cited. Several times he speaks of it as the epistle of Peter to
   the people of Pontus. He expressly ascribes it to "Peter the apostle,"
   "the apostle of Christ," &c.

   The second of Peter he never quotes. The first of John is often quoted
   by Cyprian. "The apostle John," says he, "mindful of this command,
   writes in this epistle, Hereby we perceive that we know him, if we keep
   his commandments. He that saith I know him, and keepeth not his
   commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.'" The second and
   third of John he never mentions, nor the epistle of Jude.

   The opinion of Eusebius of Cesaræa, respecting the epistle of James,
   was, that it was written by one of Christ's disciples by the name of
   James, but he makes three of that name. Although he admits that the
   writer of this epistle was the brother of our Lord, who was made the
   first bishop of Jerusalem, yet he will not allow that he was one of the
   twelve. In his commentary on the Psalms, he says, "Is any among you
   afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms, as the
   sacred apostle says." In other parts of his works, he speaks very
   doubtfully of this epistle, and in one passage, where he distributes
   the books into classes, he mentions it among the books which he calls
   spurious; by which, however, he only means that it was not canonical.
   In his ecclesiastical history, he speaks of the epistles of Peter in
   the following manner, "One epistle of Peter called his first, is
   universally received. This the presbyters of ancient times have quoted
   in their writings as undoubtedly genuine; but that called his second
   epistle, we have been informed, has not been received into the
   Testament. Nevertheless, appearing to many to be useful, it has been
   carefully studied with the other Scriptures." And in another passage,
   he says, "That called the first of John and the first of Peter are to
   be esteemed authentic. Of the controverted, yet well known or approved
   by the most, are, that called the epistle of James, and that of Jude,
   and the second of Peter, and the second and third of John, whether they
   were written by the evangelist, or by another."

   Athanasius quotes the epistle of James as written by the apostle James.
   The first epistle of Peter is frequently quoted by him; and he also
   cites passages from the second epistle, and ascribes them to Peter.
   Both the first and second epistles of John are distinctly and expressly
   quoted: the third is not mentioned. He also, in two instances, cites
   the words of Jude.

   Jerome's testimony concerning the epistle of James is full and
   explicit. His words are, "James, called the Lord's brother, surnamed
   Justus, as some think son of Joseph, by a former wife; but as I rather
   think, the son of Mary, the sister of our Lord's mother, mentioned by
   John in his gospel, (soon after our Lord's passion ordained by the
   apostles bishop of Jerusalem) wrote but one epistle, which is among the
   seven Catholic epistles; which too has been said to have been published
   by another in his name; but gradually, in process of time, it has
   gained authority. This is he of whom Paul writes in the epistle to the
   Galatians, and he is often mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, and
   also several times in the gospel, called, "according to the Hebrews,"
   lately translated by me into Greek and Latin."

   Augustine received all the Catholic epistles. He quotes James as an
   apostle. He often cites both the epistles of Peter. He also refers to
   John's three epistles, and quotes Jude, and calls him an apostle.

   In the works of Ephrem, the Syrian, who lived, and wrote voluminously,
   in the fourth century, there are express quotations from the epistle of
   James, from the second of Peter, the second and third of John, and from
   Jude, as well as from those Catholic epistles which were undisputed.
   Rufin received all the books as canonical, which are now so esteemed by
   Christians generally. Why these epistles have received the appellation
   of Catholic, various reasons have been assigned. Some have supposed
   that they were so called, because they contain the one catholic
   doctrine which was delivered to the churches by the apostles of our
   Saviour, and which might be read by the universal church. Others are of
   opinion that they received this appellation, because they were not
   addressed to one person, or church, like the epistles of Paul, but to
   the Catholic church. This opinion seems not to be correct, for some of
   them were written to the Christians of particular countries, and others
   to individuals.

   A third opinion, advanced by Dr. Hammond, and adopted by Dr. Macknight,
   and which has some probability, is, that the first of Peter, and first
   of John, being received by all Christians, obtained the name of
   Catholic, to distinguish them from those which at first were not
   universally received; but, in process of time, these last, coming to be
   universally received, were put into the same class with the first, and
   the whole thenceforward had the appellation of Catholic.

   This denomination is as old as the time of Eusebius, and probably
   older, for Origen repeatedly called John's first epistle Catholic; and
   the same is done by Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria. The same
   appellation was given to the whole seven by Athanasius, Epiphanius, and
   Jerome. Of these, it is probable, that the epistle of James was first
   written, but at what precise time, cannot be determined.

   As there were two disciples of the name of James, it has been much
   disputed to which of them this epistle should be attributed. Lardner
   and Macknight have rendered it exceedingly probable that this epistle
   was written by James the Less, who is supposed to have been related to
   our Lord, and who seems for a long time to have had the chief authority
   in the church at Jerusalem; but Michaelis is of a different opinion,
   and says, that he sees "no reason for the assertion, that James, the
   son of Zebedee, was not the author of this epistle," But the reasons
   which he assigns for his opinion have very little weight.

   The date of this epistle may, with considerable probability, be
   referred to the year 62; for it is supposed that James was put to death
   in the following year. Its canonical authority and divine inspiration,
   although called in question by some, in ancient as well as modern
   times, ought to be considered as undoubted. One strong evidence that it
   was thus received by early Christians, may be derived from the old
   Syriac version of the New Testament; which, while it leaves out several
   other books, contains this.

   It seems not to have been as well known in the western churches as most
   other books of Scripture; but learned men have observed, that Clement
   of Rome has quoted it no less than four times; and it is also quoted by
   Ignatius, in his genuine epistle to the Ephesians; and we have already
   shown that it was received as the writing of the apostle James, by
   Origen, Athanasius, and Jerome.

   The first epistle of Peter has ever been considered authentic, and has
   been cited by Clement of Rome, Polycarp, the Martyrs of Lyons,
   Theophilus Bishop of Antioch, Papias, Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria,
   and Tertullian. The only matter of doubt respecting it is, what place
   we are to understand by Babylon, where Peter was when he wrote. On this
   subject there are three opinions: the first, that by this name a place
   in Egypt is signified; the second, that Babylon in Assyria, properly so
   called, is meant; and the third, which is generally maintained by the
   Romanists, and some Protestants, is, that Rome is here called Babylon.
   Eusebius and Jerome understood that this epistle was written from Rome.
   The time of its being written was probably about the year of our Lord
   65 or 66.

   The date of the epistle of Jude may as well be placed about the same
   period, as at any other time, for we have no documents which can guide
   us to any certain decision. The objection to the canonical authority of
   this epistle, derived from the author's having quoted the apocryphal
   book of Enoch, is of no validity; for the fact is, that Jude makes no
   mention of any book, but only of a prophecy, and there is no evidence
   that the apocryphal book of Enoch was then in existence; but if he did
   quote a truth from such a book, it argues no more against his
   inspiration than Paul's quoting Epimenides does against his being an
   inspired man.

   The three epistles of John were probably written about the year 96 or
   97. It has commonly been supposed that the Apocalypse was the last
   written book of the New Testament, but Townsend insists that the three
   epistles of John were last written.--See Townsend's New Testament, vol.
   ii.

SECTION XII.

   CANONICAL AUTHORITY OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION.

   Hermas gives many indications of having read the Revelation, for he
   often imitates John's description of the New Jerusalem, and sometimes
   borrows his very words. He speaks of the Book of Life and of those
   whose names are written in it. He speaks also of the saints whom he
   saw, being clothed in garments white as snow. Papias also, doubtless,
   had seen the book of Revelation; for some of his opinions were founded
   on a too literal interpretation of certain prophecies of this book. But
   neither Papias nor Hermas expressly cites the Revelation.

   Justin Martyr is the first who gives explicit testimony to the
   Apocalypse. His words are, "And a man from among us by name John, one
   of the apostles of Christ, in the Revelation made to him, has
   prophesied that the believers in our Christ shall live a thousand years
   in Jerusalem; and after that, shall be the general and indeed eternal
   resurrection and judgment of all men together." In the epistle of the
   Church of Lyons and Vienne, in France, which was written about the year
   of our Lord one hundred and eighty, there is one passage cited from the
   book of Revelation: "For he was indeed a genuine disciple of Christ,
   following the Lamb whithersoever he goes.'"

   Irenæus expressly quotes the Revelation, and ascribes it to John the
   apostle. And in one place, he says, "It (the Revelation,) was seen no
   long time ago in our age, at the end of the reign of Domitian." And in
   the passage preserved by Eusebius, he speaks of the exact and ancient
   copies of this book; which he says, "was confirmed, likewise, by the
   concurring testimony of those who had seen John."

   Theophilus of Antioch, also, as we are assured by Eusebius, cited
   testimonies from the Apocalypse of John, in his book against
   Hermogenes. And in his works which are extant, there is one passage
   which shows that he was acquainted with the Revelation. "This Eve,"
   says he, "because she was deceived by the serpent--the evil demon, who
   is also called Satan, who then spoke to her by the serpent--does not
   cease to accuse: this demon is also called the Dragon."

   The Revelation of John is often quoted by Clement of Alexandria. In one
   passage, he says, " Such an one, though here on earth he be not
   honoured with the first seat, shall sit upon the four and twenty
   thrones, judging the people, as John says in the Revelation." That
   Clement believed it to be the work of the apostle John is manifest,
   because in another place he expressly cites a passage, as the words of
   an apostle; and we have just seen that he ascribes the work to John.

   Tertullian cites many things from the Revelation of John; and he seems
   to have entertained no doubt of its being the writing of the apostle
   John, as will appear by a few quotations; "John in his Apocalypse, is
   commanded to correct those who ate things sacrificed to idols, and
   commit fornication." Again, "The apostle John in the Apocalypse,
   describes a sharp two-edged sword, coming out of the mouth of
   God."--"We have churches, disciples of John, for though Marcion rejects
   his Revelation, the succession of bishops, traced to the original, will
   assure us that John is the author." And in another place he has a long
   quotation from the book of Revelation.

   Hippolytus, who lived in the third century, and had great celebrity,
   both in the eastern and western churches, received the Revelation as
   without doubt the production of the apostle John. Indeed, he seems to
   have written a comment on this book, for Jerome, in the list of his
   works, mentions one, "On the Revelation." Hippolytus was held in so
   high esteem, that a noble monument was erected to him in the city of
   Rome, which, after lying for a long time buried, was dug up near that
   city, A. D. 1551. His name, indeed, is not now on the monument, but it
   contains a catalogue of his works, several of which have the same
   titles as those ascribed to Hippolytus by Jerome and Eusebius, together
   with others not mentioned by them; among which is one "of the gospel of
   John and the Revelation."

   Origen calls the writer of the Apocalypse, "evangelist and apostle;"
   and, on account of the predictions which it contains, "prophet" also.
   In his book against Celsus he mentions "John's Revelation, and divers
   other books of Scripture." It was Origen's intention to write a
   commentary on this book, but whether he ever carried his purpose into
   execution is unknown. Nothing of the kind has reached our times.

   Dionysius of Alexandria, who lived about the middle of the third
   century, and was one of the most learned men of his time, has entered
   into a more particular discussion of the canonical authority of the
   book of Revelation than any other ancient author. From what has been
   said by him, we learn on what account it was that this book, after
   having been universally received by the earlier Fathers, fell with some
   into a certain degree of discredit. About this time the Chiliasts, or
   Millennarians, who held that Christ would reign visibly on earth with
   his saints for a thousand years, during which period all manner of
   earthly and sensible pleasures would be enjoyed, made their appearance.
   This opinion they derived from a literal interpretation of some
   passages in the book of Revelation; and as their error was very
   repugnant to the feelings of most of the Fathers, they were led to
   doubt of the authority, or to disparage the value of the book from
   which it was derived.

   The first rise of the Millennarians, of the grosser kind, seems to have
   been in the district of Arsinoe, in Egypt, where one Nepos composed
   several works in defence of their doctrine; particularly a book
   "Against the Allegorists." Dionysius took much pains with these
   errorists, and entered with them into a free and candid discussion of
   their tenets, and of the true meaning of the book of Revelation; and
   had the satisfaction to reclaim a number of them from their erroneous
   opinions. His own opinion of the Revelation he gives at large, and
   informs us, that some who lived before his time had utterly rejected
   this book, and ascribed it to Cerinthus; but, for his own part, he
   professes to believe that it was written by an inspired man, whose name
   was John, but a different person from the apostle of that name; for
   which opinion he assigns several reasons, but none of much weight. His
   principal reason is, that the language of this book is different from
   that of the apostle John in his other writings. To which Lardner
   judiciously answers, that supposing this to be the fact, it will not
   prove the point, for the style of prophecy is very different from the
   epistolary or historical style. But this laborious and learned
   collector of facts denies that there is such a difference of style, as
   to lay a foundation for this opinion; and, in confirmation of his own
   opinion, he descends to particulars, and shows that there are some
   striking points of resemblance between the language of the Apocalypse
   and the acknowledged writings of the apostle John.

   The opinion of those persons who believed it to be the work of
   Cerinthus, is utterly without foundation; for this book contains
   opinions expressly contrary to those maintained by this heretic; and
   even on the subject of the millennium his views did not coincide with
   those expressed in the Revelation. Caius seems to have been the only
   ancient author who attributed this book to Cerinthus, and to him
   Dionysius probably referred when he spoke of some, before his time, who
   held this opinion. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, received the book of
   Revelation as of canonical authority, as appears by the manner in which
   he quotes it. "Hear," says he, "in the Revelation, the voice of thy
   Lord, reproving such men as these, Thou sayest I am rich and increased
   in goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art
   wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.'" Rev. iii.
   17. Again, "So in the Holy Scriptures, by which the Lord would have us
   to be instructed and warned, is the harlot city described." Rev. xvii.
   1-3. Finally, "That waters signify people, the divine Scriptures show
   in the Revelation."

   Victorinus, who lived towards the close of the third century, often
   cites the book of Revelation, and ascribes it to John the apostle. That
   Lactantius received this book is manifest, because he has written much
   respecting the future destinies of the church, which is founded on the
   prophecies which it contains.

   Until the fourth century, then, it appears that the Revelation was
   almost universally received; not a writer of any credit calls it in
   question; and but one hesitates about ascribing it to John the apostle;
   but even he held it to be written by an inspired man. But, about the
   beginning of the fourth century, it began to fall into discredit with
   some on account of the mysterious nature of its contents, and the
   encouragement which it was supposed to give to the Chiliasts. Therefore
   Eusebius of Cesaræa, after giving a list of such books as were
   universally received, adds, "After these, if it be thought fit, may be
   placed the Revelation of John, concerning which we shall observe the
   different opinions at a proper time." And again, "There are, concerning
   this book, different opinions."

   This is the first doubt expressed by any respectable writer concerning
   the canonical authority of this book; and Eusebius did not reject it,
   but would have it placed next after those which were received with
   universal consent. And we find at this very time, the most learned and
   judicious of the Fathers received the Revelation without scruple, and
   annexed it to their catalogues of the books of the New Testament. Thus
   Athanasius after giving an account of the twenty-two canonical books of
   the Old Testament, proceeds to enumerate the books of the New
   Testament, in the following manner, which he makes eight in number:--1.
   Matthew's gospel; 2. Mark's; 3. Luke's; 4. John's; 5. The Acts; 6. The
   Catholic epistles; 7. Paul's fourteen epistles; and 8. the Revelation,
   given to John the evangelist and divine in Patmos.

   Jerome, in giving an account of the writings of John the evangelist,
   speaks also of another John, called the presbyter, to whom some
   ascribed the second and third epistles under the name of John. And we
   have already seen that Dionysius of Alexandria ascribed the Revelation
   to another John. This opinion, we learn from Jerome, originated in the
   fact, that two monuments were found at Ephesus, each inscribed with the
   name John; but he says, "Some think that both the monuments are of John
   the evangelist." Then he proceeds to give some account of the
   Revelation. "Domitian," says he, "in the fourteenth year of his reign,
   raising the second persecution after Nero, John was banished into the
   isle of Patmos, where he wrote the Revelation, which Justin Martyr and
   Irenaeus explain." Augustine, also, received the book of Revelation,
   and quotes it very frequently. He ascribes it to the same John who
   wrote the gospel and the epistles.

   From the view which has been taken of the testimonies in favour of the
   book of Revelation, I think it must appear manifest to every candid
   reader, that few books in the New Testament have more complete evidence
   of canonical authority. The only thing which requires explanation is,
   the omission of this book in so many of the catalogues of the Fathers,
   and of ancient councils. Owing to the mysterious nature of the contents
   of this book, and to the abuse of its prophecies, by the too literal
   construction of them by the Millennarians, it was judged expedient not
   to have this book read publicly in the churches. Now, the end of
   forming these catalogues was to guide the people in reading the
   Scriptures; and as it seems not to have been desired, that the people
   should read this mysterious book, it was omitted by many in their
   catalogues. Still, however, a majority of them have it; and some who
   omitted it, are known to have received it as canonical.

   This also will account for the fact, that many of the manuscripts of
   the New Testament are without the Revelation; so that there are extant,
   comparatively, few copies of this book. But the authenticity and
   authority of the Apocalypse stand on ground which can never be shaken;
   and the internal evidence is strong in favour of a divine origin. There
   is a sublimity, purity, and consistency in it, which could not have
   proceeded from an impostor. In addition to all which, we observe, that
   the fulfilment of many of the predictions of this book is so
   remarkable, that to many learned men who have attended to this subject,
   the evidence from this source alone is demonstrative of its divine
   origin. And there is every reason to believe, that in the revolution of
   events this book, which is now to many sealed with seven seals, will be
   opened, and will be so explained, that all men will see and acknowledge
   that it is indeed "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto
   him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to
   pass--and sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John, who
   bare record of the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ."
   Rev. i. 1, 2.

SECTION XIII.

   THE TITLES GIVEN TO THE SACRED SCRIPTURES BY THE FATHERS--THESE BOOKS
   NOT CONCEALED, BUT PARTIALLY KNOWN AND REFERRED TO BY ENEMIES AS WELL
   AS FRIENDS--CITATIONS--ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS--REMARKS OF RENNELL.

   AFTER having given a particular account of the several books of the New
   Testament, it may be useful to subjoin a few general remarks on the
   testimony exhibited.

   1. The writings of the apostles, from the time of their first
   publication, were distinguished by all Christians from all other books.
   They were spoken of by the Fathers, as "Scripture;" as "divine
   Scripture;" as "inspired of the Lord;" as, "given by the inspiration of
   the Holy Ghost." The only question ever agitated, respecting any of
   these books, was, whether they were indeed the productions of the
   apostles. When this was clear, no man disputed their divine authority,
   or considered it lawful to dissent from their dictates. They were
   considered as occupying the same place, in regard to inspiration and
   authority, as the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and in imitation of
   this denomination they were called the New Testament. The other names
   by which they were distinguished, were such as these, the gospel;--the
   apostles;--the divine gospels;--the evangelical instrument;--the
   Scriptures of the Lord;--holy Scriptures;--evangelical voice;--divine
   Scriptures;--Oracles of the Lord;--divine fountains;--fountains of the
   divine fulness.

   2. These books were not in obscurity, but were read with veneration and
   avidity by multitudes. They were read not only by the learned, but by
   the people; not only in private, but constantly in the public
   assemblies of Christians, as appears by the explicit testimony of
   Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Eusebius, Cyprian, and Augustine. And no
   other books were thus venerated and read. If some other pieces were
   publicly read, yet the Fathers always made a wide distinction between
   them and the sacred Scriptures.

   3. In all the controversies which arose in the church, these books were
   acknowledged by all to be decisive authority, unless by some few of the
   very worst heretics, who mutilated the Scriptures, and forged others
   for themselves, under the names of the apostles. But most of the
   heretics endeavoured to support their opinions by an appeal to the
   writings of the New Testament. The Valentinians, the Montanists, the
   Sabellians, the Artemonites, the Arians, received the Scriptures of the
   New Testament. The same was the case with the Priscillianists and the
   Pelagians. In the Arian controversy, which occupied the church so long
   and so earnestly, the Scriptures were appealed to by both parties; and
   no controversy arose respecting the authenticity of the books of the
   New Testament.

   4. The avowed enemies of Christianity, who wrote against the truth,
   recognized the books which are now in the Canon, as those acknowledged
   by Christians in their times, for they refer to the matters contained
   in them, and some of them mention several books by name; so that it
   appears from the accounts which we have of these writings, that they
   were acquainted with the volume of the New Testament. Celsus, who lived
   and wrote less than a hundred years after the apostles, says, as is
   testified by Origen, who answered him, "I could say many things
   concerning the affairs of Jesus, and those too different from what is
   written by the disciples of Jesus, but I purposely omit them." That
   Celsus here refers to the gospels there can be no doubt. In another
   place, he says, "These things then we have alleged to you out of your
   own writings." And that the gospels to which he referred were the same
   as those which we now possess, is evident from his reference to matters
   contained in them.

   Porphyry in the third century wrote largely, and professedly, against
   the Christian religion; and although his work has shared the same fate
   as that of Celsus, yet, from some fragments which have been preserved,
   we can ascertain that he was well acquainted with the four gospels, for
   the things to which he objects are still contained in them.

   But the emperor Julian expressly mentions Matthew and Luke, and cites
   various things out of the gospels. He speaks also of John, and alleges
   that none of Christ's disciples beside ascribed to him the creation of
   the world;--and also, "that neither Paul, nor Matthew, nor Luke, nor
   Mark, has dared to call Jesus, God;"--"that John wrote later than the
   other evangelists, and at a time when a great number of men in the
   cities of Greece and Italy were converted." He alludes to the
   conversion of Cornelius and Sergius Paulus; to Peter's vision, and to
   the circular letter sent by the apostles at Jerusalem to the churches;
   which things are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. [70]

   Now, if the genuineness of these books could have been impugned on any
   plausible grounds; or if any doubt had existed respecting this matter,
   surely such men as Celsus, Porphyry, and Julian, could not have been
   ignorant of the matter, and would not have failed to bring forward
   everything of this kind which they knew; for their hostility to
   Christianity was unbounded. And it is certain, that Porphyry did avail
   himself of an objection of this kind in regard to the book of Daniel.
   Since then not one of the early enemies of Christianity ever suggested
   a doubt of the genuineness of the books of the New Testament, we may
   rest assured that no ground of doubt existed in their day; and that the
   fact of these being the genuine writings of the men whose names they
   bear, was too clearly established to admit any doubt. The genuineness
   of the books of the New Testament having been admitted by friends and
   enemies--by the orthodox and heretics, in those ages when the fact
   could be ascertained easily, it is too late in the day now for infidels
   to call this matter in question.

   5. But the testimony which we possess, is not only sufficient to prove
   that the books of the New Testament were written by the persons whose
   names they bear, but also that these books, in the early ages of the
   church, contained the same things which are now read in them. Omitting
   any particular notice of about half a dozen passages, the genuineness
   of which is in dispute, I would remark, that when we compare the
   numerous and copious quotations from these books, which are found in
   the writings of the Fathers, with our own copies, the argument is most
   satisfactory. It is true, indeed, that the Fathers do sometimes
   apparently quote from memory; and in that case, the words of the sacred
   writer are a little changed or transposed, but the sense is accurately
   retained. In general, however, the quotations of Scripture, in the
   writings of the Fathers, are verbally exact; there being no other
   variation, than what arises from the different idiom of the language
   which they use. I suppose that almost every verse, in some books of the
   New Testament, has been cited by one or another of the Fathers; so that
   if that book were lost, it might be restored by means of the quotations
   from it in other books.

   But besides these quotations, we have versions of the whole New
   Testament into various languages, some of which were made very early,
   probably not much later than the end of the first, or beginning of the
   second century. Now, on a comparison, all these versions contain the
   same discourses, parables, miracles, doctrines, precepts, and divine
   institutions. Indeed, so literal have been most versions of the New
   Testament, that they answer to one another, and to the original, almost
   word for word.

   Besides, there are in existence hundreds and thousands of manuscripts
   of the New Testament, which were written in different ages of the
   church, from the fourth or fifth century until the sixteenth. Most of
   these have been penned with great care, and in the finest style of
   calligraphy. The oldest are written on beautiful parchment, in what are
   called uncial, or capital letters. Some of these manuscripts contain
   all the books of the New Testament; others only a part; and in some
   instances, a single book. Some are in a state of good preservation,
   while others are worn and mutilated, and the writing so obscure as to
   be scarcely legible. And what is very remarkable, some copies of the
   New Testament on parchment have been found written over again with
   other matter, after the original words had been as fully obliterated as
   could easily be done. This seems a very strange practice, considering
   that good copies of the Bible must have been always too few; but the
   scarcity of parchment was so great, that men who were anxious to
   communicate their own lucubrations to the public, would resort to any
   shift to procure the materials for writing. And this is not more
   culpable or more wonderful than what has been known to take place in
   our own land and times, where the leaves of Walton's Polyglot Bible
   have been torn and used for wrapping paper.

   The exact age of the oldest manuscripts of the New Testament cannot be
   accurately ascertained, as they have no dates accompanying them which
   can safely be depended on; but as it is pretty well known at what
   period Greek accents were introduced, and also when the large uncial
   letter, as it is called, was exchanged for the small letter now in
   common use; if a manuscript is found written in the old fashion, in
   large letters, without intervals between the words, and without
   accents, it is known that it must be more ancient than the period when
   the mode of writing was changed. Now, it is manifest, that when these
   manuscripts were penned, the Canon was settled by common consent, for
   they all contain the same books, as far as as they go.

   I will sum up my observations on the Canon of the New Testament, by
   quoting a sensible and very appropriate passage from the late learned
   Mr. Rennel. It is found in his Remarks on Hone's Collection of the
   apocryphal writings of the apostolic age.

   "When was the Canon of Scripture determined? It was determined
   immediately after the death of John, the last survivor of the apostolic
   order. The Canon of the gospels was indeed determined before his death,
   for we read in Eusebius, that he gave his sanction to the three other
   gospels, and completed this part of the New Testament with his own. By
   the death of John, the catalogue of Scripture was completed and closed.
   We have seen, both from the testimony of themselves and of their
   immediate successors, that the inspiration of writing was confined
   strictly to the apostles, and accordingly we find that no similar
   pretensions were ever made by any true Christian to a similar
   authority.

   "By whom was the Canon of Scripture determined? It was determined not
   by the decision of any individual, nor by the decree of any council,
   but by the general consent of the whole and every part of the Christian
   church. It is, indeed, a remarkable circumstance, that among the
   various disputes which so early agitated the church, the Canon of
   Scripture was never a subject of controversy. If any question might be
   said to have arisen, it was in reference to one or two of those books
   which are included in the present Canon; but with respect to those
   which are out of the Canon no difference of opinion ever existed.

   "The reason of this agreement is a very satisfactory one. Every one who
   is at all versed in Ecclesiastical History is aware of the continual
   intercourse which took place in the apostolical age between the various
   branches of the church universal. This communication, as Mr. Nolan has
   well observed, arose out of the Jewish polity, under which various
   synagogues of the Jews which were dispersed throughout the gentile
   world, were all subjected to the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, and maintained
   a constant correspondence with it. Whenever then an epistle arrived at
   any particular church, it was first authenticated; it was then read to
   all the holy brethren, and was subsequently transmitted to some other
   neighbouring church. Thus we find that the authentication of the
   epistles of Paul was, the salutation with his own hands,' by which the
   church to which the epistle was first addressed might be assured that
   it was not a forgery. We find also a solemn adjuration of the same
   apostle, that his epistle should be read to all the holy brethren.'
   When this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the
   church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the epistle from
   Laodicea.' 2 Thess. iii. 17; 1 Thess. v. 27; Col. iv. 6. From this
   latter passage we infer, that the system of transmission was a very
   general one, as the epistle which Paul directs the Colossians to
   receive from the Laodiceans was not originally directed to the latter,
   but was sent to them from some other church. To prevent any mistake or
   fraud, this transmission was made by the highest authority, namely, by
   that of the bishop. Through him official communications were sent from
   one church to another, even in the remotest countries. Clement, the
   bishop of Rome, communicated with the church at Corinth; Polycarp, the
   bishop of Smyrna, wrote an epistle to the Philippians; Ignatius, the
   bishop of Antioch, corresponded with the churches of Rome, of Magnesia,
   of Ephesus, and others. These three bishops were the companions and
   immediate successors of the apostles, and followed the system of
   correspondence and intercourse which their masters had begun.
   Considering all these circumstances, we shall be convinced how utterly
   improbable it was, that any authentic work of an apostle should have
   existed in one church without being communicated to another. It is a
   very mistaken notion of Dodwell, that the books of the New Testament
   lay concealed in the coffers of particular churches and were not known
   to the rest of the world until the late days of Trajan. This might have
   been perfectly true, with respect to the originals, which were
   doubtless guarded with peculiar care, in the custody of the particular
   churches to which they were respectively addressed. But copies of these
   originals, attested by the authority of the bishop, were transmitted
   from one church to another with the utmost freedom, and were thus
   rapidly dispersed throughout the Christian world. As a proof of this,
   Peter, in an epistle addressed generally to the churches in Asia,
   speaks of all the epistles of Paul,' as a body of Scripture,
   universally circulated and known.

   "The number of the apostles, including Paul and Barnabas, was but
   fourteen. To these, and these alone, in the opinion of the early
   church, was the inspiration of writing confined: out of these, six only
   deemed it necessary to write; what they did write, was authenticated
   with the greatest caution, and circulated with the utmost rapidity;
   what was received. in any church as the writing of an apostle, was
   publicly read; no church was left to itself, or to its own direction,
   but was frequently visited by the apostles, and corresponded with by
   their successors. All the distant members of the church universal, in
   the apostles' age, being united by frequent intercourse and
   communication, became one body in Christ. Taking all these things into
   consideration, we shall see with what ease and rapidity the Canon of
   Scripture would be formed, there being no room either for fraudulent
   fabrication on the one hand, or for arbitrary rejection on the other.
   The case was too clear to require any formal discussion, nor does it
   appear that there was any material forgery that could render it
   necessary.

   "The writings of the apostles, and of the apostles alone, were received
   as the word of God, and were separated from all others, by that most
   decisive species of authority, the authority of a general, an
   immediate, and an undisputed consent. This will appear the more
   satisfactory to our minds if we take an example from the age in which
   we live. The letters of Junius, for instance, were published at
   intervals within a certain period. Since the publication of the last
   authentic letter, many under that signature have appeared, purporting
   to have been written by the same author. But this circumstance throws
   no obscurity over the matter, nor is the Canon of Junius, if I may
   transfer the term from sacred to secular writing, involved in any
   difficulty or doubt. If it should be hereafter inquired, at what time,
   or by what authority the authentic letters were separated from the
   spurious, the answer will be, that such a separation never took place;
   but that the Canon of Junius was immediately determined after the last
   letter. To us, who live so near the time of publication, the line of
   distinction between the genuine and spurious is so strongly marked, and
   the evidence of authenticity on the one side, and of forgery on the
   other, is so clear and convincing, that a formal rejection of the
   latter is unnecessary. The case has long since been determined by the
   tacit consent of the whole British nation, and no man in his senses
   would attempt to dispute it.

   "Yet how much stronger is the case of the Scriptural Canon! The author
   of Junius was known to none. He could not therefore of himself bear any
   testimony to the authenticity of his works; the authors of the New
   Testament were known to all, and were especially careful to mark, to
   authenticate, and to distinguish their writings. The author of Junius
   had no personal character which could stamp his writing with any high
   or special authority; whatever proceeded from the apostles of Christ,
   was immediately regarded as the offspring of an exclusive inspiration.
   For the Canon of Junius we have no external evidence, but that of a
   single publisher: for the Canon of Scripture, we have the testimony of
   churches which were visited, bishops who were appointed, and converts
   innumerable, who were instructed by the apostles themselves. It was
   neither the duty nor the interest of any one, excepting the publisher,
   to preserve the volume of Junius from spurious editions: to guard the
   integrity of the sacred volume was the bounden duty of every Christian
   who believed that its words were the words of eternal life.

   "If then, notwithstanding these and other difficulties which might be
   adduced, the Canon of Junius is established beyond controversy or
   dispute, by the tacit consent of all who live in the age in which it
   was written, there can be no reason why the Canon of Scripture, under
   circumstances infinitely stronger, should not have been determined in a
   manner precisely the same; especially when we remember, that in both
   cases the forgeries made their appearance subsequently to the
   determination of the Canon. There is not a single book in the spurious
   department of the apocryphal volume which was even known when the Canon
   of Scripture was determined. This is a fact which considerably
   strengthens the case. There was no difficulty or dispute in framing the
   Canon of Scripture, because there were no competitors whose claims it
   was expedient to examine; no forgeries, whose impostures it was
   necessary to detect. The first age of the church was an age of too much
   vigilance, of too much communication, of too much authority for any
   fabrication of Scripture, to hope for success. If any attempt was made
   it was instantly crushed. When the authority of the apostles and of
   apostolic men had lost its influence, and heresies and disputes had
   arisen, then it was that forgeries began to appear . . . . Nothing,
   indeed, but the general and long determined consent of the whole
   Christian world, could have preserved the sacred volume in its
   integrity, unimpaired by the mutilation of one set of heretics, and
   unincumbered by the forgeries of another."

SECTION XIV.

   NO CANONICAL BOOK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT HAS BEEN LOST.

   THIS was a subject of warm dispute between the Romanists and
   Protestants at the time of the Reformation. The former, to make room
   for their farrago of unwritten traditions, maintained the affirmative;
   and such men as Bellarmine and Pineda asserted roundly, that some of
   the most valuable parts of the canonical Scriptures were lost. The
   Protestants, on the other hand, to support the sufficiency and
   perfection of the Holy Scriptures, the corner stone of the Reformation,
   strenuously and successfully contended, that no part of the canonical
   volume had been lost.

   But the opinion, that some inspired books, which once belonged to the
   Canon, have been lost, has been maintained by some more respectable
   writers than those Romanists just mentioned. Chrysostom, Theophylact,
   Calvin, and Whitaker, have all, in some degree, countenanced the same
   opinion, in order to avoid some difficulty, or to answer some
   particular purpose. The subject, so far as the Old Testament is
   concerned, has already been considered; it shall now be our endeavour
   to show that no canonical book of the New Testament has been lost.

   And here I am ready to concede, as was before done, that there may have
   been books written by inspired men that have been lost: for inspiration
   was occasional, not constant; and confined to matters of faith, and not
   afforded on the affairs of this life, or in matters of mere science. If
   Paul or Peter, or any other apostle, had occasion to write private
   letters to their friends, on subjects not connected with religion,
   there is no reason to think that these were inspired; and if such
   writings have been lost, the Canon of Scripture has suffered no more by
   this means than by the loss of any other uninspired books.

   But again, I am willing to go further and say, that it is possible,
   (although I know no evidence of the fact,) that some things written
   under the influence of inspiration for a particular occasion, and to
   rectify some disorder in a particular church, may have been lost
   without injury to the Canon. For as much that the apostles preached by
   inspiration is undoubtedly lost, so there is no reason why every word
   which they wrote must necessarily be preserved and form a part of the
   canonical volume. For example, suppose that when Paul said, 1 Cor. v.
   9, "I wrote to you in an epistle not to company with fornicators," he
   referred to an epistle which he had written to the Corinthians before
   the one now called the first, it might never have been intended that
   this letter should form a constituent part of the Canon; for although
   it treated of subjects connected with Christian faith or practice, yet,
   an occasion having arisen, in a short time, of treating these subjects
   more at large, every thing in that epistle, (supposing it ever to have
   been written,) may have been included in the two epistles to the
   Corinthians which are now in the Canon. Or, to adopt for illustration,
   the ingenious hypothesis of Dr. Lightfoot, the epistle referred to,
   which was sent by Timothy, who took a circuitous route through
   Macedonia, might not have reached them until Paul wrote the long and
   interesting epistle called the first to the Corinthians, and thus the
   former one would be superseded. But we adduce this case merely for
   illustration, for we will attempt presently to show that no evidence
   exists that any such epistle was ever written.

   1. The first argument to prove that no canonical book has been lost, is
   derived from the watchful care of Providence over the sacred
   Scriptures.

   Now, to suppose that a book written by the inspiration of the Holy
   Spirit, and intended to form a part of the Canon, which is the rule of
   faith to the church, should be utterly and irrecoverably lost, is
   surely not very honourable to the wisdom of God, and no way consonant
   with the ordinary method of his dispensations in regard to his precious
   truth. There is good reason to think that if God saw it needful, and
   for the edification of the church, that such books should be written
   under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, by his providence he would
   have taken care to preserve them from destruction. We do know that this
   treasure of divine truth has been in all ages, and in the worst times,
   the special care of God, or not one of the sacred books would now be in
   existence. And if one canonical book might be lost through the
   negligence or unfaithfulness of men, why not all? And thus the end of
   God in making a revelation of his will might have been defeated.

   But whatever other corruptions have crept into the Jewish or Christian
   churches, it does not appear that either of them, as a body, ever
   incurred the censure of having been careless in preserving the oracles
   of God. Our Saviour never charges the Jews, who perverted the sacred
   Scriptures to their own ruin, with having lost any portion of the
   sacred deposit intrusted to them.

   History informs us of the fierce and malignant design of Antiochus
   Epiphanes to abolish every vestige of the sacred volume; but the same
   history assures us that the Jewish people manifested a heroic fortitude
   and invincible patience in resisting and defeating his impious purpose.
   They chose rather to sacrifice their lives, and suffer a cruel death,
   than to deliver up the copies of the sacred volume in their possession.
   And the same spirit was manifested, and with the same result, in the
   Dioclesian persecution of the Christians. Every effort was made to
   obliterate the sacred writings of Christians, and multitudes suffered
   death for refusing to deliver up the New Testament. Some, indeed,
   overcome by the terrors of a cruel persecution did, in the hour of
   temptation, consent to surrender the holy book; but they were ever
   afterwards called traitors; and it was with the utmost difficulty that
   any of them could be received again into the communion of the church
   after a long repentance, and the most humbling confessions of their
   fault. Now, if any canonical book was ever lost, it must have been in
   these early times when the word of God was valued far above life, and
   when every Christian stood ready to seal the truth with his blood.

   2. Another argument which appears to me to be convincing is, that in a
   little time all the sacred books were dispersed over the whole world.
   If a book had, by some accident or violence, been destroyed in one
   region, the loss could soon have been repaired by sending for copies to
   other countries.

   The considerations just mentioned would, I presume, be satisfactory to
   all candid minds, were it not that it is supposed, that there is
   evidence that some things were written by the apostles which are not
   now in the Canon. We have already referred to an epistle to the
   Corinthians which Paul is supposed to have written to them previously
   to the writing of those which we now possess. But it is by no means
   certain, or even probable, that Paul ever did write such an epistle;
   for not one ancient writer makes the least mention of any such letter;
   nor is there any where to be found any citation from it, or any
   reference to it. It is a matter of testimony in which all the Fathers
   concur, as with one voice, that Paul wrote no more than fourteen
   epistles, all of which we now have.

   The testimony of Clement of Rome is clear on this subject; and he was
   the friend and companion of Paul, and must have known which was the
   first epistle addressed by him to the Corinthian church. He says, in a
   passage before cited, "Take again the epistle of the blessed apostle
   Paul into your hands. What was it that he first wrote to you, in the
   beginning of his epistle? He did truly by the Spirit write to you
   concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, because even at that time
   you were formed into divisions or parties."

   The only objection which can be conceived to this testimony is, that
   Clement's words, when literally translated, read, "Take again the
   gospel (euangeliou) of the blessed apostle Paul;" but it is well known
   that the early Fathers called any book containing the doctrines of
   Christ the gospel; and in this case, all reasonable doubt is precluded,
   because Clement identifies the writing to which he referred, by
   mentioning some of its contents, which are found in the first epistle
   to the Corinthians, and no where else.

   But still, Paul's own declaration, stands in the way of our opinion, "I
   wrote to you in an epistle." 1 Cor. v. 9, 11. The words in the original
   are, Egrapsa humin en te epistole, the literal version of which is, "I
   have written to you in the epistle, or in this epistle;" that is, in
   the former part of it; where in fact we find the very thing which he
   says that he had written. See v. 2, 5, 6, of this same fifth chapter.
   But it is thought by learned and judicious commentators, that the words
   following, Nuni de egrapsa humin. "but now I have written unto you,"
   require that we should understand the former clause as relating to some
   former time; but a careful attention to the context will convince us
   that this reference is by no means necessary. The apostle had told
   them, in the beginning of the chapter, to avoid the company of
   fornicators, &c.; but it is manifest, from the tenth verse, that he
   apprehended that his meaning might be misunderstood, by extending the
   prohibition too far, so as to decline all intercourse with the world,
   therefore he repeats what he had said, and informs them, that it had
   relation only to the professors of Christianity, who should be guilty
   of such vices. The whole may be thus paraphrased: "I wrote to you
   above, in my letter, that you should separate from those who were
   fornicators, and that you should purge them out as old leaven; but
   fearing lest you should misapprehend my meaning, by inferring that I
   have directed you to avoid all intercourse with the heathen around you,
   who are addicted to these shameful vices, which would make it necessary
   that you should go out of the world, I now inform you that my meaning
   is, that you do not associate familiarly with any who make a profession
   of Christianity, and yet continue in these evil practices."

   In confirmation of this interpretation we can adduce the old Syriac
   version, which having been made soon after the days of the apostles, is
   good testimony in relation to this matter of fact. In this venerable
   version, the meaning of the 11th verse is thus given, "This is what I
   have written unto you," or, "The meaning of what I have written unto
   you." [71] Dr. Whitby understands this passage in a way different from
   any that has been mentioned; the reader is referred to his commentary
   on the place. And we have before mentioned the ingenious conjecture of
   Dr. Lightfoot, to which there is no objection, except that it is
   totally unsupported by evidence.

   It deserves to be mentioned here, that there is now extant a letter
   from Paul to the Corinthians, distinct from those epistles of his which
   we have in the Canon; and also an epistle from the church of Corinth to
   Paul. These epistles are in the Armenian language, but have been
   translated into Latin. The epistle ascribed to Paul is very short, and
   undoubtedly spurious. It contains no prohibitions relative to keeping
   company with fornicators. It was never cited by any of the early
   writers, nor indeed heard of until within a century past. It contains
   some unsound opinions concerning the speedy appearance of Christ, which
   Paul, in some of his epistles, took pains to contradict. The manner of
   salutation is very different from that of Paul; and this apostle is
   made to declare, that he had received what he taught them from the
   former apostles, which is contrary to his repeated solemn asseverations
   in several of his epistles. In regard to the epistle under the name of
   the church of Corinth, it does not properly fall under our
   consideration, for though it were genuine it would have no claim to a
   place in the Canon. The curious reader will find a literal translation
   of both these epistles in Jones's "New Method of settling the Canon."
   [72]

   The only other passage in the New Testament, which has been thought to
   refer to an epistle of Paul not now extant is that in Col. iv. 16. "And
   when this epistle is read among you, cause also that it be read in the
   church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the epistle from
   Laodicea."

   Now, there is clear evidence, that so early as the beginning of the
   second century there existed an epistle under this title; but it was
   not received by the church, but was in the hands of Marcion, who was a
   famous forger and corrupter of sacred books. He was contemporary with
   Polycarp, and therefore very near to the times of the apostles, but was
   stigmatized as an enemy of the truth; for he had the audacity to form a
   gospel, according to his own mind, which went by his name; and also an
   apostolicon, which contained only ten of Paul's epistles; and these
   altered and accommodated to his own notions. These, according to
   Epiphanius, were, "The epistle to the Galatians, the two to the
   Corinthians, to the Romans, the two to the Thessalonians, to the
   Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Philippians.--And," says he, "he
   takes in some part of that which is called the epistle to the
   Laodiceans,' and this he styles the eleventh of those received by
   Marcion."

   Tertullian, however, gives a very different account of this matter. He
   asserts, "that Marcion and his followers called that the epistle to the
   Laodiceans, which was the epistle to the Ephesians: which epistle,"
   says he, "we are assured, by the testimony of the church, was sent to
   the Ephesians, and not to the Laodiceans; though Marcion has taken upon
   him falsely to prefix that title to it, pretending therein to have made
   some notable discovery." And again, "I shall say nothing now of that
   other epistle, which we have inscribed to the Ephesians, but the
   heretics entitle it to the Laodiceans.'"

   This opinion, which, by Tertullian, is ascribed to Marcion, respecting
   the true title of the epistle to the Ephesians, has been adopted, and
   ingeniously defended by several distinguished moderns, as Grotius,
   Hammond, Whitby, and Paley. They rely principally on internal evidence;
   for unless Marcion be accepted as a witness, I do not recollect that
   any of the early writers can be quoted in favour of that opinion; but
   in the course of this work, we have put down the express testimony of
   some of the most respectable and learned of the Fathers, on the other
   side; and all those passages in the epistle which seem inconsistent
   with its being addressed to the Ephesians, and neighbouring churches of
   Asia, can easily be explained.--See Lardner and Macknight.

   But there is also an epistle to the Laodiceans, now extant, against
   which nothing can be said, except that almost everything contained in
   it is taken out of Paul's other epistles, so that if it should be
   received, we add nothing in reality to the Canon; and if it should be
   rejected, we lose nothing. The reader may find a translation of this
   epistle inserted in the notes at the end of the volume. [73]

   But what evidence is there that Paul ever wrote an epistle to the
   Laodiceans? The text on which this opinion has been founded, in ancient
   and modern times, correctly interpreted, has no such import. The words
   in the original are, kai ten ek Laodikeias hina kai umeis anagnote.
   "And that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea." Col. iv. 16.
   These words have been differently understood; for by them some
   understand, that an epistle had been written by Paul to the Laodiceans,
   which he desired might be read in the church at Colosse. Chrysostom
   seems to have understood them thus; and the Romish writers, almost
   universally have adopted this opinion. "Therefore," says Bellarmine,
   "it is certain that Paul's epistle to the Laodiceans is now lost." And
   their opinion is favoured by the Latin Vulgate, where we read, Eamque
   Laodicensium--that which is of the Laodiceans; but even these words
   admit of another construction.

   Many learned Protestants, also, have embraced the same interpretation;
   while others suppose that Paul here refers to the epistle to the
   Ephesians, which they think he sent to the Laodiceans, and that the
   present inscription is spurious. But that neither of these opinions is
   correct may be rendered very probable. In regard to the latter, we have
   already said as much as is necessary; and that Paul could not intend by
   the language used in the passage under consideration an epistle written
   by himself, will appear by the following arguments.

   1. Paul could not with any propriety of speech have called an epistle
   written by himself, and sent to the Laodiceans, an epistle from
   Laodicea. He certainly would have said, pros Laodikeian, or some such
   thing. Who ever heard of an epistle addressed to any individual, or to
   any society, denominated an epistle from them?

   2. If the epistle referred to in this passage had been one written by
   Paul, it would have been most natural for him to call it his epistle,
   and this would have rendered his meaning incapable of misconstruction.

   3. All those best qualified to judge of the fact, and who were well
   acquainted with Paul's history and writings, never mention any such
   epistle: neither Clement, Hermas, nor the Syriac interpreter, knew
   anything of such an epistle of Paul; and no one seems to have had
   knowledge of any such writing, except Marcion, who probably forged it
   to answer his own purposes. But whether Marcion did acknowledge an
   epistle different from all that we have in the Canon, rests on the
   authority of Epiphanius, who wrote a criticism on the apostolicon of
   Marcion; but as we have seen, Tertullian tells us a different story. It
   is of little importance to decide which of these testimonies is most
   credible: for Marcion's authority, at best, is worthless on such a
   subject.

   But it may be asked, To what epistle then does Paul refer? To this
   inquiry various answers have been given, and perhaps nothing
   determinate can now be said. Theophylact was of opinion, that Paul's
   first epistle to Timothy was here intended. But this is not probable.
   Dr. Lightfoot conjectures that it was the first epistle of John, which
   he supposes was written from Laodicea. Others have thought that it was
   the epistle of Paul to Philemon. But it seems safest, in such a case,
   where testimony is deficient, to follow the literal sense of the words,
   and to believe that it was an epistle written by the Laodiceans,
   probably to himself, which he had sent to the Colossians, together with
   his own epistle, for their perusal.

   That the epistle which is now extant is not the same as that which
   formerly existed, at least as early as the fourth century, is evident
   from the quotations from the ancient epistle, by Epiphanius; for no
   such words as he cites are in that now extant. But candour requires
   that it be mentioned that they are contained in the epistle to the
   Ephesians. Let this weigh as much as it is worth in favour of the
   opinion, that the apostle, in the passage under consideration, refers
   to the epistle to the Ephesians. This opinion, however, is perfectly
   consistent with our position, that no canonical book of the New
   Testament has been lost. This proposition, we hope, will now appear to
   the reader sufficiently established.

SECTION XV.

   RULES FOR DETERMINING WHAT BOOKS ARE APOCRYPHAL--SOME ACCOUNT OF THE
   APOCRYPHAL BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN LOST--ALL OF THEM CONDEMNED BY THE
   FOREGOING RULES--REASON OF THE ABOUNDING OF SUCH BOOKS.

   OF the apocryphal books of the New Testament, the greater part have
   long since sunk into oblivion, but a few of them are still extant. All
   of them can be proved to be spurious, or at least not canonical. Their
   claims have so little to support them, that they might be left to that
   oblivion, into which they have so generally fallen, were it not that,
   from time to time, persons unfriendly to our present Canon bring
   forward these books., and pretend that some of them, at least, have as
   good claims to canonical authority as those which are received. It will
   be satisfactory to the reader, therefore, to know the names of these
   books, and to understand the principles on which they have been
   uniformly rejected by the church.

   In the first place, then, I will mention the rules laid down by the
   Rev. Jeremiah Jones, by which it may be determined that a book is
   apocryphal, and then I will give some account of the books of this
   class which have been lost; and finally, consider the character of
   those which are still extant.

   1. That book is certainly apocryphal which contains manifest
   contradictions.

   The reason of this rule is too evident to need any elucidation.

   2. That book is apocryphal, which contains any doctrine or history,
   plainly contrary to those which are certainly known to be true.

   This rule is also too clear to require anything to be said in
   confirmation of its propriety.

   3. That book is apocryphal which contains anything ludicrous or
   trifling, or which abounds in silly and fabulous stories.

   This rule is not only true, but of great importance, in this inquiry;
   as on examination it will be found, that the largest part of apocryphal
   books may be detected by the application of this single rule.

   4. That book is apocryphal which mentions things of a date much later
   than the time in which the author, under whose name it goes, lived.

   This rule does not apply to predictions of future events, which events
   occurred long after the death of the prophet; but to a reference to
   facts, or names of places, or persons, as existing when the book was
   written, which are known to have existed, only at a period long since
   the time when the supposed author lived. The rule will be better
   understood, if illustrated by particular examples. The book entitled,
   "The Constitutions of the Apostles," speaks of the controversy which
   arose in the third century, respecting the rebaptization of heretics,
   therefore, it is not the work of Clement of Rome, to whom it has been
   ascribed; nor was it written in his time, but long afterwards.

   Again, the book under the name of Hegesippus is not genuine, for it
   mentions Constantine and Constantinople, which had no existence until
   long after the death of Hegesippus.

   Moreover, in "The Constitutions of the Apostles," there is mention of
   rites and ceremonies, relative to baptism, fasting, celibacy, &c. which
   it is certain had no existence in the times of the apostles, therefore
   this book was not written by an apostolical man, nor in the days of the
   apostles, but centuries afterwards.

   5. That book is apocryphal, the style of which is entirely different
   from the known style of the author to whom it is ascribed.

   It is easy to counterfeit an author's name, age, country, opinions,
   &c.; but it will be found almost impossible to imitate his style. An
   author, it is true, may vary his style to suit different subjects, but
   there is commonly some peculiarity by which he may be distinguished
   from all others. "Jerome," says Sixtus, "writes one way in his
   epistles, another in his controversies, a third in his
   commentaries;--one way when young, another when old, yet he always so
   writes that you may know him to be the same Jerome still, as a man
   knows his friend under all the various casts and turns of his
   countenance." Thus Augustine says of Cyprian, " His style has a certain
   peculiar face by which it may be known."

   It should be remembered, however, that this rule, although it may often
   furnish a certain detection of spurious writings is one which requires
   much caution in the application. There is need of a long and intimate
   acquaintance with the style of an author, before we are competent to
   determine whether a book could have been written by him: and the
   difference ought to be very distinctly marked before we make it the
   ground of any important judgment, respecting the genuineness of a work
   ascribed to him, especially if there be external evidence in its
   favour. In fact, too free an application of this rule has led to many
   errors, both in ancient and modern times.

   6. That book is spurious and apocryphal, whose idiom and dialect are
   different from those of the country to which the reputed author
   belonged.

   The idiom and dialect of a language are very different from the style
   of an author. Every language is susceptible of every variety of style,
   but the idiom is the' same in all who use the language: it is the
   peculiarity, not of an individual, but of a whole country. But as every
   writer has a style of his own, which cannot easily be imitated by
   another, so every country has an idiom, which other nations, even if
   they learn the language, cannot, without great difficulty, acquire. And
   for the same reason that a writer cannot acquire the idiom of a foreign
   tongue, he cannot divest himself of the peculiarities of his own.

   An Englishman can scarcely write and speak the French language, so as
   not to discover by his idiom that it is not his vernacular tongue.
   Hence also, a North Briton can be distinguished, not only from the
   peculiarity of his pronunciation, but by his idiom. And this is the
   reason that modern scholars can never write Latin, in the manner of the
   classic authors. This rule, therefore, is of great importance in
   detecting the spuriousness of a book, when the real author lived after
   the time of the person whose name is assumed, or in a country where a
   different language, or a different dialect was in use. It will be found
   almost impossible to avoid phrases and modes of speech, which were not
   in use in the time of the person under whose name the work is edited:
   and the attempt at imitating an idiom which is not perfectly familiar,
   leads to an affectation and stiffness of manner which usually betrays
   the impostor. The influence of native idiom appears nowhere more
   remarkably than in the writings of the New Testament. These books,
   although written in the Greek tongue, contain an idiom so manifestly
   different from that of the language in common use at that time, that it
   cannot but be observed by all who have even a superficial acquaintance
   with Grecian literature.

   The fact is, as has often been observed by learned men, that while the
   words of these books are Greek the idiom is Hebrew. The writers had,
   from their infancy, been accustomed to the Syro-Chaldaic language,
   which is a corruption of the ancient Hebrew. Now, this peculiarity of
   idiom could never have been successfully imitated by any native Greek;
   nor by any one, not early conversant with the vernacular tongue of
   Palestine at that time. When, therefore, men of other countries, and
   other times, undertook to publish books under the name of the apostles,
   the imposture was manifest at once, to all capable of judging correctly
   on the subject; because, although they could write in the same language
   as the apostles, they could not possibly imitate their idiom. This,
   therefore, furnishes a most important characteristic, to distinguish
   between the genuine writings of the apostles and such as are
   supposititious.

   7. That book is spurious which exhibits a disposition and temper of
   mind very different from that of the person to whom it is ascribed.

   This rule depends on a principle in human nature well understood, and
   needs no particular elucidation.

   8. That book is not genuine, which consists principally of mere
   extracts from other books.

   This is also so evident, that it requires no illustration.

   9. Those books which were never cited, nor referred to as Scripture, by
   any writer of credit for the first four hundred years after the
   apostles' days, are apocryphal.

   10. Those books which were expressly rejected by the Fathers of the
   first ages as spurious, and attributed by them to heretics, are
   apocryphal.

   By the application of the foregoing rules, it can be shown, that every
   book which claims canonical authority, not included in our present
   Canon, is apocryphal. When we denominate all books apocryphal which are
   not canonical, we do not mean to reduce them all to the same level. A
   book which is not canonical may be a very instructive and useful book.
   As a human composition it may deserve to be highly esteemed; and as the
   writing of a pious and eminent man of antiquity it may claim peculiar
   respect.

   The ancient method of division was more accurate than ours. They
   divided all books into three classes; first, the canonical; secondly,
   the ecclesiastical; and thirdly, the spurious. And there is reason to
   believe that some books which were written without the least fraudulent
   design, by anonymous authors, have, by the ignorance of their
   successors, been ascribed to the wrong persons.

   That the Fathers did sometimes cite apocryphal books, in their
   writings, is true; but so did Paul cite the heathen poets. If these
   books are sometimes mentioned, without any note of disapprobation
   annexed, it can commonly be clearly ascertained from other places in
   the same author, that he held them to be apocryphal. Thus Origen, in
   one place, quotes "the gospel according to the Hebrews," without any
   expression of disapprobation; but in another place he rejects it as
   spurious, and declares, "That the church receives no more than four
   gospels."

   Sometimes the Fathers cited these apocryphal books, to show that their
   knowledge was not confined to their own books, and that they did not
   reject others, through ignorance of their contents. Remarkably to this
   purpose are the words of Origen. "The church," says he, "receives only
   four gospels: heretics have many, such as the gospel of the Egyptians,
   the gospel of Thomas, &c.: these we read, that we may not seem to be
   ignorant to those who think they know something extraordinary, if they
   are acquainted with those things which are recorded in these books." To
   the same purpose speaks Ambrose; for, having mentioned several of these
   books, he says, "We read these that they may not be read by others: we
   read them, that we may not seem ignorant; we read them, not that we
   receive them, but that we may reject them; and may know what those
   things are, of which they make such a boast." In some instances, it
   seems probable that some of the Fathers took passages out of these
   books, because they were acknowledged by those against whom they were
   writing; being willing to dispute with them on their own principles and
   to confute them by their own books.

   It may perhaps be true also, that one or two of the Fathers cited
   passages from these books, because they contained facts not recorded in
   the canonical gospels. The apostle John informs us that our Lord
   performed innumerable miracles, besides those which he had recorded;
   "The which, if they should be written every one, I suppose the world
   itself could not contain the books which should be written." Now, some
   tradition of some of these things would undoubtedly be handed down as
   low as to the second century, and might find its way into some of the
   apocryphal gospels, and might be cited by persons who did not believe
   the book to be of canonical authority; just as we refer to any profane
   author for the proof of such facts as are credibly related by them.
   There is, at least, one example of this. Jerome refers to the gospel
   according to the Hebrews for a fact; and yet he most explicitly rejects
   this book as apocryphal.

   The only books which were ever read in the churches, besides the
   canonical, were a few written by apostolical men; which, although not
   written by a plenary inspiration, were the genuine writings of the
   persons whose names they bore, and were pious productions, and tended
   to edification; such as, the "Epistle of Clement," the "Shepherd of
   Hermas," and the "Epistle of Barnabas;" but no spurious books were ever
   read in the churches.

   None of the writings falsely ascribed to Christ and his apostles, ever
   acquired so much authority, as to be publicly read in any church, as
   far as we know. Indeed, although the apocryphal books of the New
   Testament were very numerous, yet they did not appear in the age of the
   church next after the times of the apostles. In the first century no
   books of this description are referred to, unless we suppose that Luke,
   in the beginning of his gospel, intends to speak of such. In the second
   century a few spurious writings began to be first put into circulation,
   as, "the Gospel according to the Hebrews;" "the Gospel of Truth," used
   by the Valentinians; "the Preaching of Peter;" "the Traditions of
   Matthias;" "the Acts of Paul and Thecla:" "the Gospel of Marcion;" "the
   Revelation of Cerinthus;" and a few others of less note. But in the
   third century the number of apocryphal books was considerably
   increased; and in the fourth and fifth centuries they were exceedingly
   multiplied.

   If it be inquired, how it happened that so many apocryphal books were
   written, it may confidently be answered, that the principal cause was
   the abounding of heresies. Almost all the spurious writings, under the
   names of the apostles, are the productions of heretics, as we learn
   from the testimony of those Fathers who have made mention of them. It
   is however true, that some mistaken well-meaning people thought that
   they could add honour to the apostles, or contribute to the edification
   of the church, by resorting to (what have improperly been called) pious
   frauds. They imagined, also, that they could recommend Christianity to
   the Gentiles, by inventing stories, which they rashly pretended were
   sayings or actions of Christ: thus adopting the pernicious maxim, so
   peremptorily denounced by Paul, "that we may do evil that good may
   come;" or that the goodness of the end will sanctify the badness of the
   means. Of this we have one remarkable example, in the spurious book
   still extant, entitled, "the Acts of Paul and Thecla," which a certain
   Asiatic presbyter confessed that he had forged, and assigned, as his
   reason for this forgery, that he wished to show respect to Paul. But,
   in connection with this fact, we have satisfactory proof of the
   vigilance of the church, in guarding the sacred Canon from corruption;
   for the book was no sooner published, than a strict inquiry was
   instituted into its origin, and the presbyter mentioned above, having
   been detected as the author, was deprived of his office in the church.
   This account is given by Tertullian; and Jerome adds that the detection
   of this forgery was made by the apostle John.

   It is probable, also, that some of these books were written without any
   evil purpose, by weak men, who wrote down all the stories they had
   received by tradition; for, no doubt, a multitude of traditions
   respecting Christ and his apostles, with extravagant distortions and
   additions, would be handed down for several generations.

   By all these means, the number of apocryphal books of the New Testament
   was greatly multiplied. But by far the greater number of these have
   perished; yet there is no difficulty in determining, that none of them
   had any just claim to a place in the Canon. By one or more of the rules
   laid down above, they can all be demonstrated to have been apocryphal:
   and indeed most of them are never mentioned by any ancient author, in
   any other light than as spurious writings. There is a famous decree of
   pope Gelasius, in which at least twenty-five of these books are named,
   and declared to be apocryphal. It is not certain, indeed, whether this
   decree ought to be ascribed to Gelasius, or to one of his predecessors,
   Damasus; but there can be no doubt that it is very ancient. It is by
   most supposed to have been formed in the council which met at Rome, A.
   D. 494. A translation of this decree, extracted from Jones, will be
   found in the notes at the end of the volume. [74]

SECTION XVI.

   APOCRYPHAL BOOKS WHICH ARE STILL EXTANT--LETTER OF ABGARUS KING OF
   EDESSA TO JESUS, AND HIS ANSWER--EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS--LETTERS OF
   PAUL TO SENECA--PROTEVANGELION OF JAMES--THE GOSPEL OF OUR SAVIOUR'S
   INFANCY--THE ACTS OF PILATE--THE ACTS OF PAUL AND THECLA.

   WE come now to consider those apocryphal books which are still extant,
   and concerning which, therefore, we can speak more particularly.

   The first of these is, "the letter of Abgarus, king of Edessa,
   addressed to Jesus, and sent by his footman Ananias."

   Eusebius is the first who makes mention of this epistle, and the sum of
   his account is, that our Saviour's miraculous works drew innumerable
   persons to him, from the most remote countries, to be healed of their
   diseases;--that Abgarus, a famous king beyond the Euphrates, wrote to
   him, because he was afflicted with a malady incurable by human art. Our
   Lord promised to send one of his disciples to him, and Thaddeus, one of
   the seventy disciples, was sent by Thomas after the ascension of Jesus,
   by an intimation given him from heaven. For the truth of this story,
   Eusebius appeals to the public records of the city of Edessa, where, he
   says, all the transactions of the reign of Abgarus are preserved in the
   Syriac language, out of which he translated these epistles, and the
   accompanying history. He proceeds to relate that Thaddeus having come
   to Edessa wrought many miracles, and healed many that were diseased.
   Abgarus, supposing that this was the person whom Christ had, in his
   letter, promised to send to him, as soon as Thaddeus was introduced to
   him, perceiving something extraordinary in his countenance, fell down
   before him, at which his nobles were greatly surprised. The king having
   inquired whether he was the person sent by Christ, he answered, that on
   account of the faith of Christ he was sent, and assured him that all
   things should be according to his faith. To which the king replied,
   that he believed so much in Christ, that he was resolved, had it not
   been for fear of the Romans, to have made war with the Jews for
   crucifying him. Thaddeus informed him of the ascension of Christ to his
   Father. The king replied, I believe in him, and in his Father also: on
   which the apostle said, I lay my hand on you in the name of the Lord
   Jesus Christ; and the king was instantly cured of his disease. He also
   cured others who were diseased; and, on the morrow, the king ordered
   all the city to meet together, to hear the apostle preach. The king
   offered him gold and silver, which he refused, saying, "We have left
   our own, and should we take that which is another's?"

   These epistles are also mentioned by Ephrem, the Syrian, who was a
   deacon in the church of Edessa, in the latter end of the fourth
   century. His account of this matter, as given by Dr. Grabe, is as
   follows: "Blessed be your city, and mother Edessa, which was expressly
   blessed by the mouth of the Lord, and his disciples, but our apostles;
   for when Abgarus the king, who built that city, thought fit to send and
   acknowledge Christ, the Lord and Saviour of all, in his pilgrimage on
   earth; saying, I have heard all things which are done by you, and how
   much you have suffered by the Jews, who contemn you, wherefore, come
   hither, and take up your residence with me; I have a little city which
   shall be equally yours and mine; hereupon the Lord admiring his faith
   sent by messengers a blessing unto the city, which should abide for
   ever, till the Holy One be revealed from heaven, even Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, and God of God."

   No other writer of the first four centuries makes any explicit mention
   of this epistle; but Procopius, in the sixth century, in his history of
   the Persian war, relates, " That Abgarus had been long afflicted with
   the gout, and finding no relief from the physicians, but hearing of the
   miracles of Christ, sent to him, and desired that he would come and
   live with him; and that upon his receiving an answer from Christ, he
   was immediately cured; and that our Saviour, in the end of his letter,
   gave Abgarus assurance, that his city should never be taken by
   enemies."

   Evagrius, in the latter end of the sixth century, appeals to this
   account of Procopius, and confirms the story that the city never should
   be taken by enemies, by a reference to some facts, particularly the
   failure of Chosroes to take the city, when he laid siege to it. But
   this author adds a circumstance, which has much the air of a fable,
   that this failure of capturing the city was brought about by a picture
   of Christ's face, which he had impressed on a hand kerchief, and sent
   to Abgarus, at his earnest request.

   Cedrenus adds to all the rest that Christ sealed his letter with a seal
   consisting of seven Hebrew letters, the meaning of which was, "the
   divine miracle of God is seen."

   Among the moderns, a very large majority are of opinion that this
   epistle is apocryphal. Indeed, the principal advocates of its
   genuineness are a few learned Englishmen, particularly Dr. Parker, Dr.
   Cave, and Dr. Grabe, but they do not speak confidently on the subject;
   while on the other side are found almost the whole body of learned
   critics, both Protestants and Romanists. Now, that this epistle and
   history existed in the archives of Edessa in the time of Eusebius,
   there is no room to doubt, unless we would accuse this respectable
   historian of the most deliberate falsehood; for he asserts that he
   himself had taken them thence. His words, however, must not be too
   strictly interpreted, as though he had himself been at Edessa, and had
   translated the epistle from the Syriac; for there is reason to believe
   that he never visited that place, and that he was not acquainted with
   the Syriac tongue. The words will be sufficiently verified, if this
   document was translated and transmitted to him through an authentic
   channel from Edessa.

   It is probable, therefore, that this story has some foundation in
   truth. Probably Thaddeus, or some other apostle, did preach the gospel
   and perform miracles in that city; but how much of the story is
   credible, it is not now easy to determine. But I think it may be shown
   that this epistle was never penned by Jesus Christ, for the following
   reasons:

   1. It is never mentioned in the genuine gospels; nor referred to by any
   writer of the first three centuries.

   2. If this account had been true, there never could have been any
   hesitation among the apostles about preaching the gospel to the
   Gentiles.

   3. It is unreasonable to believe that if Christ had been applied to by
   this king for healing, he would have deferred a cure until he could
   send an apostle after his ascension. This does not correspond with the
   usual conduct of the benevolent Saviour.

   4. It seems to have been a tradition universally received that Christ
   never wrote anything himself; and if he had written this letter, it
   would have been more prized than any other portion of Scripture, and
   would have been placed in the Canon, and everywhere read in the
   churches.

   5. After it was published by Eusebius, it never gained so much credit
   as to be received as a genuine writing of Christ. As it was unknown in
   the first three centuries, so in the fourth when published it was
   scarcely noticed by any writer.

   6. The plain mention of our Lord's ascension in the epistle, is an
   evidence of its spuriousness; for in all his discourses, recorded by
   the evangelists, there is no such explicit declaration of this event;
   and it cannot be supposed that he would speak more explicitly to a
   heathen king than to the persons chosen to be witnesses of his actions,
   and dispensers of his doctrine. There is, however, nothing in the
   sentiments expressed in this epistle unsuitable to the humble and
   benevolent character of the Saviour; but learned men have supposed that
   there are several internal evidences of spuriousness besides the one
   just mentioned. I conceive, however, that the reasons already assigned
   will be considered as sufficient to prove that this letter forms no
   part of the sacred Canon. It is excluded by several of the rules laid
   down above; and even if it were genuine, it seems that it ought rather
   to be received as a private communication than as intended for the
   edification of the whole church. The history which accompanies the
   letter has several strong marks of spuriousness, but as this does not
   claim to be canonical, we need not pursue the subject further. It may,
   however, not be amiss to remark that the story of the picture of our
   Saviour impressed on a handkerchief and sent to Abgarus, is enough of
   itself to condemn the history as fabulous. This savours not of the
   simplicity of Christ, and has no parallel in anything recorded in the
   gospel.

   II. There is now extant an epistle under the title of "Paul to the
   Laodiceans," and it is known that as early as the beginning of the
   second century, a work existed under this name which was received by
   Marcion the heretic. But there is good reason for thinking that the
   epistle now extant is an entirely different work from the one which
   anciently existed; for the present epistle does not contain the words
   which Epiphanius has cited from that used by Marcion; and what renders
   this clear is, that the ancient epistle was heretical, and was rejected
   by the Fathers of the church with one consent; whereas, the one which
   we now have contains nothing erroneous; for it is a mere compilation
   from the other epistles of Paul with a few additional sentences which
   contain no heretical doctrine. As the epistle is short, a translation
   of it will be given in the notes at the end of the volume. [75]

   Concerning the ancient epistle under this title Philastrius says, "That
   some were of opinion that it was written by Luke; but because the
   heretics have inserted some (false) things, it is for that reason not
   read in the churches. Though it be read by some, yet there are no more
   than thirteen epistles of Paul read to the people in the church, and
   sometimes that to the Hebrews." "There are some," says Jerome, "who
   read an epistle, under the name of Paul to the Laodiceans, but is
   rejected by all." And Epiphanius calls it "an epistle not written by
   the apostles." The epistle now extant never having been received into
   the ancient catalogues, read in the churches, or cited as Scripture, is
   of course apocryphal. It is also proved not to be genuine, because it
   is almost entirely an extract from the other epistles of Paul.

   III. Another writing which has been ascribed to Paul is, "Six Letters
   to Seneca," with which are connected "Eight Letters from Seneca to
   Paul." These letters are of undoubted antiquity, and several learned
   men of the Jesuits have defended them as genuine, and allege that they
   are similar to other epistles received into the Canon which were
   addressed to individuals. That such letters were in existence as early
   as the fourth century appears from a passage in Jerome's Catalogue of
   Illustrious Men, where he gives the following account of Seneca:
   "Lucius Anneus Seneca, born at Corduba, a disciple of Sotio, a Stoic,
   uncle of Lucan the poet, was a person of very extraordinary temperance,
   whom I should not have ranked in my Catalogue of Saints, but that I was
   determined to it by the "epistles of Paul to Seneca," and "Seneca to
   Paul," which are read by many. In which, though he was at that time
   tutor to Nero, and made a very considerable figure, he saith he wishes
   to be of the same repute among his countrymen, as Paul was among the
   Christians. He was slain by Nero two years before Peter and Paul were
   honoured with martyrdom."

   There is also a passage in Augustine's 54th epistle to Macedonius,
   which shows that he was not unacquainted with these letters. His words
   are, "It is true, which Seneca, who lived in the times of the apostles,
   and who wrote certain epistles to Paul which are now read, said, he who
   will hate those who are wicked must hate all men.'"

   There is no authentic evidence that these letters have been noticed by
   any of the rest of the Fathers. Indeed, it has been too hastily
   asserted by several eminent critics, that Augustine believed that the
   letters of Paul to Seneca were genuine; but the fact is, that he makes
   no mention whatever of Paul's letters; he only mentions those of Seneca
   to Paul. The probability is that he never saw them, for had he been
   acquainted with them, it is scarcely credible that he would have said
   nothing respecting them in this place.

   Neither does Jerome say anything from which it can with any certainty
   be inferred that he received these letters as genuine. He gives them
   the title by which they were known, and says they were read by many;
   but if he had believed them to be genuine letters of Paul, would he not
   have said much more? Would he not have claimed for them a place among
   Paul's canonical epistles? And what proves that this Father did not
   believe them to be genuine is, that in this same book he gives a full
   account of Paul and his writings, and yet does not make the least
   mention of these letters to Seneca.

   But the style of these letters sufficiently demonstrates that they are
   not genuine. Nothing can be more dissimilar to the style of Paul and of
   Seneca, than that of these epistles. "The style of those attributed to
   Seneca," says Dupin, "is barbarous, and full of idioms that do not
   belong to the Latin tongue." "And those attributed to Paul," says Mr.
   Jeremiah Jones, "have not the least tincture of the gravity of the
   apostle, but are rather compliments than instructions." The
   subscriptions of these letters are very different from those used by
   these writers in their genuine epistles. Seneca is made to salute Paul
   by the name of brother; an appellation not in use among the heathen,
   but peculiar to Christians. By several of these letters it would appear
   that Paul was at Rome when they were written, but from others the
   contrary may be inferred. It seems strange if they were both in the
   city, that they should date their letters by consulships; and, indeed,
   this method of dating letters was wholly unknown among the Romans; and
   there are several mistakes in them in regard to the consuls in
   authority at the time.

   Their trifling contents is also a strong argument of spuriousness.
   "They contain nothing," says Dupin, "worthy either of Seneca or of
   Paul; scarcely one moral sentiment in the letters of Seneca, nor
   anything of Christianity in those of Paul." What can be more unlike
   Paul than the fifth letter, which is occupied with a servile apology
   for putting his own name before Seneca's, in the inscription of his
   letters, and declaring this to be contrary to Christianity? These
   letters, moreover, contain some things which are not true, as "that the
   emperor Nero was delighted and surprised at the thoughts in Paul's
   epistles to the churches:--and that Nero was both an admirer and
   favourer of Christianity." But very incongruous with this, and also
   with Paul's character is that which he is made to say in his fourth
   epistle, where he entreats Seneca to say no more to the emperor
   respecting him or Christianity, lest he should offend him. Yet, in the
   sixth letter he advises Seneca to take convenient opportunities of
   insinuating the Christian religion, and things favourable to it to Nero
   and his family. But for further particulars the reader is referred to
   the epistles themselves, a translation of which may be found in "Jones
   on the Canon."

   IV. There is extant a spurious gospel entitled, the "Protevangelion of
   James," in the Greek language, which was brought from the east by
   Postell, who asserts that it is held to be genuine by the oriental
   churches, and is publicly read in their assemblies with the other
   Scriptures. This learned man, moreover, undertakes the defence of this
   gospel as the genuine production of the apostle James, and insists that
   it ought at least to have a place in the Hagiographa. But his arguments
   are weak, and have been fully refuted by Fabricius and Jones.

   This apocryphal book, however, appears to be ancient; or at least there
   was formerly a book under the same name, but that it is not canonical
   is easily proved. It is quoted by none of the ancient Fathers except
   Epiphanius, who explicitly rejects it as apocryphal. It is found in
   none of the catalogues, and was never read in the primitive church. It
   contains many false and trifling stories; and in its style and
   composition is a perfect contrast to the genuine gospels of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ. From the Hebraisms with which it abounds, it
   has been supposed to be the work of some person who was originally a
   Jew; but as it was anciently used by the Gnostics, there can be little
   doubt that the author when he wrote, belonged to some one of the
   heretical sects which so abounded in primitive times.

   There is also another work which has a near affinity with this, called
   "The Nativity of Mary." And although these books possess a similar
   character, and contain many things in common, yet in other points they
   are contradictory to each other, as they both are to the evangelical
   history. The internal evidence is itself sufficient to satisfy any
   candid reader of their apocryphal character. [76]

   V. The largest apocryphal gospel extant is entitled "The Gospel of our
   Saviour's Infancy." There is also remaining a fragment of a gospel
   ascribed to Thomas, which probably was originally no other than the one
   just mentioned. These gospels were never supposed to be canonical by
   any Christian writer. They were forged and circulated by the Gnostics,
   and altered from time to time according to their caprice.

   The "Gospel of our Saviour's Infancy," seems to have been known to
   Mohammed, or rather to his assistants; for according to his own
   account, in the Koran, he was unable to read. Many of the things
   related in the Koran, respecting Christianity, are from this apocryphal
   work. This gospel is condemned by almost every rule laid down for the
   detection of spurious writings; and if all other evidence were wanting,
   the silly, trifling and ludicrous stories, with which it is stuffed,
   would be enough to demonstrate, that it was spurious and apocryphal. To
   give the curious reader an opportunity of contrasting these apocryphal
   legends with the gravity and simplicity of the genuine gospels, I have
   inserted some of the miracles recorded in this book, at the end of the
   volume. [77]

   It seems highly probable that this "Gospel of the Saviour's Infancy,"
   and the book of the "Nativity of Mary," were originally parts of the
   same work; an evidence of which is, that in the Koran, there is a
   continued and connected story, which is taken partly from the one, and
   partly from the other. [78] The same thing is proved by the fact, that
   Jerome in one place speaks of a preface which he had written to the "
   Gospel of our Saviour's Infancy," in which he condemns it, because it
   contradicts the gospel of John, and in another place, he uses the same
   words, and says they are in the preface to the "Nativity of Mary."

   Both these apocryphal books have been formerly ascribed to Lucius
   Charinus, who lived in the latter part of the third century, and who
   rendered himself famous, by forging spurious works under the name of
   the apostles.

   VI. There is another apocryphal gospel, entitled, "the Gospel of
   Nicodemus," or, "the Acts of Pilate," which was probably forged about
   the same time as the one last treated of, and it is very likely by the
   same person. That it was the custom for the governors of provinces in
   the Roman empire, to transmit to the emperors an account of all
   remarkable occurrences under their government, is capable of proof from
   the Roman history, and Eusebius expressly informs us that this was
   customary: and Philo Judæus speaks of "the daily memoirs which were
   transmitted to Caligula, from Alexandria."

   That Pontius Pilate transmitted some account of the crucifixion of
   Christ, and of his wonderful works, is, therefore, in itself, highly
   probable; but it is rendered certain, by the public appeal made to
   these "Acts of Pilate," both by Justin Martyr and Tertullian, in their
   Apologies; the one addressed to the Roman emperor Antonius Pius, and
   the other probably to the Roman senate. The words of Justin Martyr are,
   "And of the truth of these facts you may be informed, out of the acts
   which were written by Pontius Pilate." And in the same apology he
   refers to these acts for proof, " That our Saviour cured all sorts of
   diseases, and raised the dead."

   Tertullian, in two places of his Apology, appeals to records which were
   transmitted to Tiberius from Jerusalem. His testimony is remarkable in
   both places, and deserves to be transcribed: "Tiberius," says he, "in
   whose time the Christian name became first known in the world, having
   received information from Palestine in Syria, that Jesus Christ had
   there given manifest proof of the truth of his divinity, communicated
   it to the senate, insisting upon it as his prerogative, that they
   should assent to his opinion in that matter; but the senate not
   approving it refused. Cæsar continued in the same opinion, threatening
   those who were accusers of the Christians."

   In the other passage, after enumerating many of the miracles of Christ,
   he adds, "All these things, Pilate himself, who was in his conscience
   for following Christ, transmitted to Tiberius Cæsar; and even the
   Cæsars themselves had been Christians, if it had been consistent with
   their secular interests." Both Eusebius and Jerome, cite this testimony
   of Tertullian as authentic. It seems therefore certain, that some
   account of Christ and his actions was transmitted by Pilate to the
   emperor. "For," to use the words of an eminent man, "Tertullian, though
   a Christian writer, durst never have presumed to impose upon the senate
   themselves, with such a remarkable story, if he was not able to prove
   it; and that he was, is evident from Justin Martyr, who often appeals
   to the Acts of Pilate, concerning the history of our Saviour-That
   Pilate did send such acts is evident, for scarce any man, much less
   such a man as Justin Martyr, would have been so foolish, or so
   confident, as to affirm a thing in which it would be so easy to convict
   him of falsehood." [79]

   And another, speaking of the same thing, says, "They were men of
   excellent learning and judgment; but no man who could write an apology,
   can be supposed to have so little understanding, as to appeal to that
   account which Pilate sent to Tiberius, concerning the resurrection of
   Christ, in apologies, dedicated to the Roman emperor himself, and to
   the senate, if no such account had ever been sent." [80]

   It does not follow, however, that these Fathers had ever seen these
   Acts, or that they were ever seen by any Christian. During the reigns
   of heathen emperors, Christians could have no access to the archives of
   the nation; but the fact of the existence of such a record might have
   been, and probably was, a matter of public notoriety; otherwise, we
   never can account for the confident appeal of these learned and
   respectable writers. There is no difficulty in conceiving how such a
   fact might have been certainly known to these Fathers, without
   supposing that they had seen the record. As the learned Casaubon says,
   "Some servants or officers of one of the Cæsars, who were converted to
   Christianity, and had opportunity of searching the public records at
   Rome, gave this account to some Christians, from whom Justin and
   Tertullian had it."

   It may seem to be an objection to the existence of such Acts, that they
   were never made public when the emperors became Christians; but it is
   altogether probable, that they were destroyed through the malice of the
   senate, or of some Roman emperor who was hostile to Christianity. They
   who took so much pains to destroy the writings of Christians, would not
   suffer such a monument of the truth of Christianity to remain in their
   own palace. But as to those Acts of Pilate which are now extant, no one
   supposes that they are genuine. They have every mark of being spurious.
   The external and internal evidence is equally against them; and it
   would be a waste of time to enter into any discussion of this point.

   It may, however, be worth while to inquire into the motives which
   probably led some mistaken Christian to forge such a narrative. And
   there seems to have been two: first, to have it in his power to show
   the record, to which the Fathers had so confidently referred. The
   heathen adversaries might say, after the destruction of the genuine
   Acts of Pilate, Where is the document to which this appeal has been
   made? let it be produced. And some man, thinking that he could serve
   the cause of Christianity by forging Acts, under the name of Pilate,
   was induced through a mistaken zeal, to write this narrative.

   But there was another reason which probably had some influence on this
   fact. About the close of the third century, the heathen had forged and
   published a writing called "The Acts of Pilate," the object of which
   was to render the Christians odious and contemptible to the public, by
   foul calumnies against their Founder and his apostles. Of this fact,
   Eusebius gives us express and particular information. "From whence,"
   says he, "the forgery of these is manifestly detected, who have lately
   published certain Acts against our Saviour. In which, first, the very
   time which is assigned to them discovers the imposture; for those
   things which they have impudently forged, to have come to pass at our
   Saviour's crucifixion, are said to have occurred in the fourth
   consulship of Tiberius, which coincides with the seventh of his reign;
   at which time, it is certain, Pilate was not yet come into Judea, if
   any credit is due to Josephus, who expressly says, that Pilate was not
   constituted governor of Judea until the twelfth year of Tiberius." [81]
   And in another place he says, "Seeing therefore that this writer,
   (Josephus) who was himself a Jew,. has related such things in his
   history concerning John the Baptist and the Saviour, what can they
   possibly say for themselves, to prevent being convicted of the most
   impudent forgery, who wrote those things against John and Christ." And
   in the ninth book of his ecclesiastical history, this writer gives us
   information, still more particular, respecting this malicious forgery.
   "At length, (the heathen) having forged certain Acts of Pilate,
   concerning our Saviour, which were full of all sorts of blasphemy
   against Christ, they caused them, by the decree of Maximinus, to be
   dispersed through all parts of the empire; commanding by letters, that
   they should be published to all persons, in every place, both in cities
   and country places; and that schoolmasters should put them into the
   hands of their children, and oblige them to learn them by heart,
   instead of their usual lessons."

   Here it may be observed, that while this impudent forgery clearly shows
   with what malicious efforts the attempt was made to subvert the gospel,
   it proves at the same time, that there had existed a document under the
   name of "The Acts of Pilate.'" Now, the circulation of such an impious
   piece of blasphemy, probably instigated Charinus, or whoever was the
   author of these Acts, to counteract them by a work of another kind,
   under the same name. How this book came to be called, "The Gospel of
   Nicodemus," will appear by the subscription annexed to it, in which it
   is said, "The emperor Theodosius the great, found at Jerusalem, in the
   hall of Pontius Pilate, among the public records, the things which were
   transacted in the nineteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar, emperor of the
   Romans--being a history written in Hebrew by Nicodemus, of what
   happened after our Saviour's crucifixion." And if this subscription be
   no part of the original work, still it may have occasioned this title;
   or it may have originated in the fact, that much is said about
   Nicodemus in the story which is here told. But even if we had the
   original Acts of Pilate, or some history of Nicodemus, it needs no
   proof that they could have no just claim to a place in the Canon.

   VII. The last apocryphal book which I shall mention, is that entitled
   "The Acts of Paul and Thecla." There is no doubt but that this book is
   apocryphal. It was so considered by all the Fathers who have mentioned
   it. Tertullian says respecting it, "But if any read the apocryphal
   books of Paul, and thence defend the right of women to teach and
   baptize, by the example of Thecla, let them consider that a certain
   presbyter of Asia, who forged that book, under the name of Paul, being
   convicted of forgery, confessed that he did it out of respect to Paul,
   and so left his place." [82] And Jerome, in his life of Luke, says,
   "The Acts of Paul and Thecla, with the whole story of the baptized
   lion, I reckon among the apocryphal Scriptures." And in the decree of
   Pope Gelasius, it is asserted, "That the Acts of Thecla and Paul' is
   apocryphal."

   It is manifest, however, that the primitive Christians gave credit to a
   story respecting Paul and Thecla, on which this book is founded: for it
   is often referred to as a history well known and commonly believed.
   Thus Cyprian, or some ancient writer under his name, says, "Help us, O
   Lord, as thou didst help the apostles in their imprisonment, Thecla
   amidst the flames, Paul in his persecutions, and Peter amidst the waves
   of the sea." And again, "Deliver me, O Lord, as thou didst deliver
   Thecla, when in the midst of the amphitheatre she was in conflict with
   the wild beasts." Eusebius mentions a woman by this name, but he places
   her long after the apostle Paul, and she is, therefore, supposed to be
   another person. Epiphanius relates, "That when Thecla met Paul, she
   determined against marriage, although she was then engaged to a very
   agreeable young man." [83] Augustine refers to the same thing, and
   says, "By a discourse of Paul's, at Iconium, he incited Thecla to a
   resolution of perpetual virginity, although she was then actually
   engaged to be married." Many others of the Fathers speak of Thecla as
   of a person whose history was well known. And among the moderns,
   Baronius, Locrinus, and Grabe, look upon this history as true and
   genuine, written in the apostolic age, and containing nothing
   superstitious or unsuitable to that time. But none have ventured to
   assert that these Acts ought to have a place in the Canon.

   No doubt the book now extant is greatly altered from that ancient
   history referred to by the Fathers, and probably the original story was
   founded on some tradition which had a foundation in truth; but what the
   truth is, it is impossible now to discover among such a mass of fables
   and ridiculous stories as the book contains. As it now stands, it
   contains numerous things which are false in fact; others which are
   inconsistent with the canonical Scriptures, and some totally
   incompatible with the true character of Paul. Moreover, it is
   favourable to several superstitious practices which had no existence in
   the apostles' days; and finally, the forgery was acknowledged as it
   relates to the ancient Acts, and those now existing cannot be more
   genuine than the original; but to these many things have been added of
   a silly and superstitious kind.

SECTION XVII.

   NO PART OF THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION HANDED DOWN BY UNWRITTEN TRADITION.

   IN the former part of this work it was seen that it was not only
   necessary to show that the apocryphal writings had no right to a place
   in the sacred volume, but that there was no additional revelation which
   had been handed down by oral tradition. The same necessity devolves
   upon us in relation to the New Testament; for while it is pretty
   generally agreed by all Christians what books should be received into
   the Canon, there is a large society which strenuously maintains that
   besides the revelation contained in the divine record written by the
   apostles and their assistants, by the plenary inspiration of the Holy
   Spirit, there is a further revelation consisting of such things as were
   received from the mouth of Christ himself while upon earth, or taught
   to the churches by his inspired apostles, which were not by them nor in
   their time committed to writing, but which have come down to us by
   unbroken tradition.

   The importance of this inquiry is manifest; for if, in addition to the
   written word, there are important doctrines and necessary sacraments of
   the church which have come down by tradition, it would be perilous
   thing for us to remain ignorant of those things which God has enjoined,
   or to deprive ourselves of the benefits to be derived from those means
   of grace, which he has instituted for the edification and salvation of
   the church. But seeing traditions are much more liable to alteration
   and corruption than written documents, it is very necessary that we
   should be on our guard against imposition; and if it is a duty to
   exercise much care and diligence in distinguishing between inspired
   books and such as are spurious, it cannot be less incumbent to
   ascertain first whether any part of God's revealed will has been handed
   down by tradition only, and next to learn accurately what those things
   are which have been thus communicated. And as there are apocryphal
   books which claim a place in the Canon, so doubtless there would be
   apocryphal traditions, if any truths had been conveyed to the church
   through this channel. But if there be no satisfactory evidence of any
   such revelation having come down to us, nor any possibility of
   ascertaining what proceeded from the apostles, and what from the fancy
   and superstition of men, then we are right in refusing the high claims
   of tradition, and adhering inflexibly to the written word, "which is
   able," through faith, "to make us wise unto salvation."

   This doctrine of traditions is most convenient and favourable to the
   church of Rome in all her controversies with Protestants and others;
   for whatever she may assert as an article of faith, or teach as a part
   of Christian duty, although there be no vestige of it in the word of
   God, may readily be established by tradition. For as the church alone
   has the keeping of this body of oral law, she only is the proper judge
   of what it contains, and indeed can make it to suit herself. If we
   should concede to the Romanists what they claim on this point, the
   controversy with them might well be brought to an end, and all we
   should have to do, would be to yield implicit faith to whatever they
   might please to teach us. And even if we should be required to believe
   and practise, in direct opposition to the plain declarations of holy
   Scripture, yet, as the true interpretation of Scripture on this plan is
   only in the hands of the infallible head of the church, and is indeed
   understood by means of unwritten traditions, we must not trust to our
   own understanding in the most evident matters, nor even to our own
   senses, although several of them should concur in giving us notice of
   some fact. Now, before we give ourselves up to be led blindly in such a
   way as this, it behoves us diligently and impartially to inquire,
   whether God has required of us this implicit submission to men. We
   ought to be assured that their authority over our faith and conscience
   has a divine warrant for its exercise; and especially we should be
   satisfied, on sufficient grounds, that these unwritten traditions, on
   which the whole fabric rests, are truly the commands of God; for if
   they are not, we have the highest authority for rejecting them. And if
   their claim to a divine origin cannot be made out clearly, they cannot
   in reason bind us to obedience; for when God gives a law he promulgates
   it with sufficient clearness that all whom it concerns may know what is
   required of them.

   To exhibit fairly the true point of controversy on this subject, it
   will be requisite to make several preliminary observations, that it may
   be clearly understood what we admit and what we deny.

   1. In the first place then, it is readily admitted that a law revealed
   from heaven and communicated to us orally, with clear evidence of its
   origin, is as binding as if written ever so often. When God uttered the
   ten commandments on Mount Sinai, in the midst of thunderings and
   lightnings, it surely was as obligatory upon the hearers, as after he
   had written them on tables of stone. It is a dictate of common sense,
   that it is a matter of indifference how a divine revelation is
   communicated, provided it come to us properly authenticated.

   2. Again, it is conceded, that for a long time there was no other
   method of transmitting the revelations received from heaven, from
   generation to generation, but by oral tradition, and such external
   memorials as aided in keeping up the remembrance of important
   transactions. As far as appears books were unknown, and letters not in
   use, until a considerable time after the flood. During the long period
   which preceded the time of Moses, all revelations must have been handed
   down by tradition. But while this concession is willingly made, it
   ought in connection to be remarked, that this mode was then used
   because no other existed; and that, in the early ages of the world, the
   longevity of the patriarchs rendered that a comparatively safe channel
   of communication which would now be most uncertain; and notwithstanding
   this advantage, the fact was, that in every instance, as far as we are
   informed, in which divine truth was committed to tradition, it was
   utterly lost, or soon became so corrupted by foreign mixtures, that it
   was impossible to ascertain what part of the mass contained a
   revelation from God. It is therefore the plausible opinion of some,
   that writing was revealed from heaven, for the very purpose of avoiding
   the evil which had been experienced, and that there might be a certain
   vehicle for all divine communications: and it is certain, that all that
   we know of the history of alphabetical writing, leads us to connect its
   origin with the commencement of written revelations.

   It is, therefore, not an improbable supposition, that God taught
   letters to Moses for the express purpose of conveying, by this means,
   his laws to distant ages, without alteration; and it deserves to be
   well considered, that after the command was given to Moses, to write in
   a book the laws and statutes delivered to him, nothing was left to oral
   tradition, as has been shown in the former part of this work.

   3. It will be granted also, that tradition, especially when connected
   with external memorials, is sufficient to transmit, through a long
   lapse of time, the knowledge of particular events, or of transactions
   of a very simple nature.

   Thus it may be admitted, that if the gospels had not come down to us,
   we might by tradition be assured that Christ instituted the eucharist
   as a memorial of his death; for, from the time of its institution, it
   has, in every successive age, and in many countries, been celebrated to
   perpetuate the remembrance of that event. And it is not credible that
   such a tradition should be uniform at all times, and everywhere, and be
   connected with the same external rite, if it was not founded in fact.
   Besides, the thing handed down, in this instance, is so simple in its
   nature, that there was no room for mistake.

   There is one fact, for the truth of which we depend entirely on
   tradition, so far as external testimony is concerned, and that is the
   truth which in this work we have been attempting to establish, that the
   books of the New Testament were written by the persons under whose
   names they have come down to us. This fact is incapable of being proved
   from the Scriptures, because we must first be assured that they contain
   the testimony of inspired men before we can prove anything by them. The
   point to be established here is, that the apostles wrote these books.
   If it were ever so often asserted in a book, that a certain person was
   its author, this would not be satisfactory evidence of its genuineness,
   because any impostor can write what falsehoods he pleases in a book,
   and may ascribe it to whom he will; as in fact many have written
   spurious works, and ascribed them to the apostles. We must, therefore,
   have the testimony of those who had the opportunity of judging of the
   fact, given either explicitly or implicitly.

   In most cases, where a book is published under the name of some certain
   author, in the country in which he lived and was known, a general
   silent acquiescence in the fact, by the people of that age and country,
   with the consent of all that came after them, may be considered as
   satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of such book. But where much
   depends on the certainty of the fact in question, it is necessary to
   have positive testimony; and in order that it be satisfactory, it
   should be universal, and uncontradicted. When, therefore, a certain
   volume is expressly received as the work of certain individuals, by all
   who lived at or near the time when it was published, and all succeeding
   writings concur in ascribing it to the same persons, and not a solitary
   voice is raised in contradiction, the evidence of its genuineness seems
   to be as complete as the nature of the case admits. Just such is the
   evidence of the genuineness of the books of the New Testament; or, at
   least, of most of them. It is, however, the evidence of tradition; but
   of such a tradition as is abundantly sufficient to establish a fact of
   this sort. The thing attested is most simple in its nature, and not
   liable to be misunderstood. This necessity of tradition to establish
   the authenticity of the books of the New Testament, has been made a
   great handle of by the Romanists, in the defence of their favourite
   doctrine. They pretend that the point which we have here conceded, is
   all that is necessary to establish their whole system on the firmest
   foundation. They argue, that if we must receive the Scriptures
   themselves by tradition, much more other things. Indeed, they ascribe
   all the authority which the Scriptures possess to the testimony of the
   church, without which they assert that they would deserve no more
   credit than any other writings. But because a single fact, incapable of
   proof in any other way, must be received by tradition, it does not
   follow that numerous other matters which might easily have been
   recorded, must be learned in the same manner. Because a document
   requires oral testimony to establish its authenticity, it is not
   therefore necessary to prove the truth of the matters contained in that
   record by the same means.

   The very purpose of written records is to prevent the necessity of
   trusting to the uncertainty of tradition; and as to the allegation that
   the Scriptures owe their authority to the church, it amounts to no more
   than this, which we freely admit, that it is by the testimony of the
   early Fathers that we are assured that these writings are the
   productions of the apostles, and it is true that most of those
   witnesses who have given testimony were members of the Catholic church.
   But our confidence in their testimony on this point, is not because
   they were members of the church, but because they lived in times and
   circumstances favourable to an accurate knowledge of the fact which
   they report. And accordingly we admit the testimony of those who were
   out of the church; yea, of its bitterest enemies to the same fact, and
   on some accounts judge it to be the most unexceptionable. While we
   weigh this evidence it would be absurd to make its validity depend on
   the witnesses being members of the church; for that would be to
   determine that the church was divine and infallible, before we had
   ascertained that the Scriptures were the word of God. Surely, if on
   examination it had turned out that the Scriptures were not inspired,
   the authority of the Christian church would have been worth nothing,
   and therefore previously to the decision on this point we cannot defer
   anything to the authority of the church. The truth is, that the
   witnesses being of the church is, in this inquiry, merely an incidental
   circumstance. A sufficient number of competent and credible witnesses,
   not of the church, would establish the fact just as well as those who
   have given testimony, and, as was before observed, such testimony on
   the score of freedom from all partiality has the advantage.

   The testimony of Jews and heathen has, on this account, been demanded
   by infidels, and has been sought for with avidity by the defenders of
   Christianity, and in the view of all considerate men is of great
   weight. But it is not just to ascribe the authority of these books to
   the church, because the greater number of the witnesses of their
   apostolical origin were members of the church. The law enacted by the
   supreme legislature of the state does not owe its authority to the men
   who attest its genuineness. It is true, it would not be known certainly
   to be a law without the attestation, but it would be absurd to ascribe
   the authority of the law to the persons whose testimony proved that it
   was really a law of the state. The cases are exactly parallel. The
   Scriptures cannot owe their authority to the church, for without them
   the church can have no authority, and although she may, and does give
   ample testimony in favour of their divine origin, this confers no
   authority on them, it only proves to us that they have authority which
   is derived from the Spirit of God, by whom they were indited. It is
   truly wonderful how this plain case has been perplexed and darkened by
   the artifice and sophistry of the writers of the church of Rome.

   But if it be insisted, that if we admit tradition as sufficient
   evidence of a fact in one case, we ought to do so in every other where
   the tradition is as clear, we answer, that to this we have no
   objection, provided this species of proof be as necessary and as clear
   in the one case as the other. Let any other fact be shown to be as
   fully attested as the genuineness of the books of the New Testament,
   and to need this kind of proof as much, and we will not hesitate to
   receive it as true, whatever may be the consequence. But the very fact
   which we have been considering, seems to raise a strong presumption
   against the necessity of depending on tradition for anything else. Why
   were these books written? Was it not to convey to us, and to all future
   ages, the revelations of God to man? Because it is necessary to
   authenticate by testimony this record, must we depend on the same
   testimony for information on the points of which the record treats?
   Surely not. For the proof of these we have nothing to do but refer to
   the document itself; otherwise the possession of written records would
   be useless. If, indeed, a doubt should arise about the meaning of
   something in the record, it would not be unreasonable to inquire how it
   had been understood and practised on by those who received it at first;
   but if we should find a society acting in direct opposition to a
   written charter on which their existence depended, and pretending to
   prove that they were right by appealing from the written documents to
   vague traditions, all sensible men not interested would judge that the
   case was a very suspicious one.

   4. We are, moreover, ready to acknowledge that the gospel was at first,
   for several years, communicated orally by the apostles and their
   assistants. The churches when first planted had no written gospels;
   they received the same truths now contained in the gospels and
   epistles, by the preaching of the apostles and others; and, doubtless,
   were as well instructed as those churches which have had possession of
   the whole inspired volume. And what they had thus received without book
   they could communicate to others, and thus, if the gospels and epistles
   had never been written, the Christian religion might have been
   transmitted from generation to generation. Then it may be asked, why
   the writing of these books should hinder the transmission of many
   things, which might not be contained in them, to future generations?
   for it cannot be doubted that many things were said and done by Christ
   which were not recorded in the gospels; and there is reason to think
   that the apostles were much fuller in their sermons than in their
   writings; and that they established many rules for the good order and
   government of the church, of which we have in their epistles either no
   account or only brief hints; which though they might be readily
   understood by those who had received their verbal instructions, are
   insufficient without tradition to teach us what rules and institutions
   were established in the churches by apostolical authority. Now, if
   these were transmitted by tradition to the next generation, and by them
   to the following, and so on in an uninterrupted series until the
   present time, are we not as much bound to receive such traditions, and
   be governed by them as by the written word?

   I have now presented the argument in favour of traditions in the
   strongest light in which I am able to place it; and it would be
   uncandid not to admit, that it wears at first sight a face of
   plausibility: and if the whole case as here stated, could be made out
   with satisfactory evidence, I think we should be constrained to
   receive, to some extent, this oral law of the Romish church. But before
   any man can reasonably be required to rest his faith on tradition, he
   has a right to be satisfied on several important points; as, whether it
   was the purpose of God to permit any part of the revelation intended
   for the use of the church, in all future ages, to be handed down by
   tradition. For, as he directed everything in the law given at Mount
   Sinai, intended to regulate the faith and practice of the Israelites,
   to be committed to writ ing by Moses, it is noways improbable that the
   same plan was pursued, in regard to the writings of the New Covenant;
   especially, when it is considered how much superior written
   communications are to verbal, as it respects accuracy. When a channel
   for conveying the truth had been provided, calculated to preserve all
   communications from corruption, and when it is acknowledged, that this
   was used for a part of the matter to be transmitted, how can it be
   accounted for, that another part should be committed to the uncertainty
   of oral tradition? Why not commit the whole to writing?

   But it is incumbent on the advocates of tradition to show, by undoubted
   proofs, that what they say has come down by tradition was really
   received from the mouth of Christ, or from the teaching of his
   apostles. As they wish to claim for this rule an authority fully equal
   to that which is given to the Scriptures, they ought to be able to
   produce the very words in which these instructions were given. But this
   they do not pretend to do. It may be said, indeed, that words and
   sentences, in their just order and connection, cannot be conveyed by
   tradition, and therefore this demand is unreasonable. I answer, that
   this allegation is most true, but instead of making in favour of
   traditions, it is a strong argument to prove, that nothing thus
   received can be of equal certainty and authority with the written word.
   When an article of faith is proposed, which is contained in the
   Scriptures, we can turn to the sacred text and read the words of Christ
   and his apostles, and may be assured that they express the truth
   contained in said article. But if an article of faith be asserted to
   have come down by tradition, we have no opportunity of knowing the
   words in which it was expressed: for, while it is pretended that the
   doctrine or instruction has reached us, the words have been lost; for
   what advocate of tradition is able, in any single case, to furnish us
   with the words of any divine revelation, which is not contained in the
   sacred Scriptures?

   But it is essential to the credit of traditions, that it be proved
   clearly, that those articles of religion, or institutions of worship,
   said to be received from this source, have indeed been handed down,
   without alteration or corruption, from Christ and his apostles. It is
   not sufficient that they have been long received, and have now the
   sanction of the belief and practice of the whole Catholic church. It
   ought to be shown, that they have always, from the very days of the
   apostles, been received with universal consent. We know that the church
   has undergone many vicissitudes; that she has sometimes been almost
   extirpated by the sword of persecution; has been overrun with dangerous
   errors; has been overwhelmed with the darkness of Gothic ignorance; and
   we believe, has greatly apostatized from purity of doctrine and
   worship; and this accords with the prophecy of Paul, who clearly
   intimates that a time would come, when there should be a falling away.
   Now it may have happened, that during this long period of adversity,
   heresy, darkness, and corruption, many things may have crept in, and
   may have obtained an extensive and firm footing, which were totally
   unknown in the days of the apostles, or in the primitive church; and
   that this has in fact occurred, we are not left to conjecture. It is a
   matter of historical record, which cannot be disputed, and which is not
   denied even by the Romanists themselves. Who that is not insane with
   prejudice, could persuade himself that all the opinions, rites and
   ceremonies, which now exist in the Romish church, were prevalent in the
   times of the apostles, and were received from them by tradition?

   Besides, there is a multitude of other things received and held to be
   important by the church of Rome, of which there is no vestige in the
   Scriptures, and concerning which there is no early tradition. Many
   rules and ceremonies which have been long in use, can be traced to
   their commencement at a period much later than that of the apostles.
   Now amidst such a mass of traditions, how can it be ascertained which
   have come down from Christ and his apostles? Perhaps we shall be told,
   that the infallible head of the church can determine with certainty
   what we ought to believe and practise; but if there be on earth an
   infallible judge, we have no need of traditions. All that is necessary
   is, for this person to establish his claim to infallibility, and then
   all will be as much bound to receive his decisions, as if they were
   expressly written in the holy Scriptures. On this ground the
   controversy between the Romanists and Protestants first commenced. The
   defenders of the old system appealed to the authority of the Pope, and
   the infallibility of the church, but as it was impossible to sustain
   themselves by Scripture on these points, they found it very convenient
   to have recourse to the doctrine of unwritten traditions, which they
   pretended had been handed down from Christ and his apostles. Grant them
   this, and there is no doctrine, however absurd, which may not be
   supported. Grant them this, and it will be in vain to appeal any more
   to the sacred Scriptures as a standard of truth; for this traditionary
   law not only inculcates what is not found in the Scriptures, but
   teaches the only true interpretation of Scripture. Traditions may,
   therefore, be considered as the bulwark of the Romish church. Concede
   to them the ground which they assume, and the whole body of their
   ceremonial laws and unscriptural practices is safe. For as they can
   feign what traditions they please, having the keeping of them entirely
   in their own hands, they are prepared to defend every part of their
   system: but take this away from them, and their defence is gone. Bring
   them to the ground of clear scriptural testimony, and they are weak;
   for it is manifest that the Bible knows nothing of their monstrous
   accumulation of superstitious rites.

   The council of Trent, therefore, early in their sessions, made a decree
   on this subject, in which, after recognizing the Scriptures, they add:
   "The Holy Synod receives and venerates traditions relating both to
   faith and manners, as proceeding from the mouth of Christ himself, or
   as dictated by the Holy Spirit, and preserved in an uninterrupted
   succession in the Catholic church, with equal affection and reverence,
   as the written Scriptures!" This was the first decree of the fourth
   session of this famous Council.

   Before leaving this subject, it will be proper to consider some of the
   other arguments, which the Romanists bring forward in support of their
   beloved traditions.

   And the first is imposing, as it is derived from the express
   declarations of Scripture, in which we are exhorted to obey traditions.
   "Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus, that ye
   withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not
   after the tradition which he received of us." [84] Here Paul makes
   express mention of tradition. And in the preceding chapter, "Therefore
   brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught
   whether by word, or our epistle." Now all that is necessary to refute
   the argument derived from these and such like passages, where the word
   traditions is used, is to observe, that Paul employs this word in a
   very extensive sense, to signify whatever doctrines or institutions he
   had delivered to the churches, whether by his preaching or writing. And
   in the verse first cited, he evidently refers to what he had said to
   them in his first epistle, for the words following are, "For yourselves
   know how ye ought to follow us; for we behaved not ourselves disorderly
   among you; neither did we eat any man's bread for nought, &c." Now,
   this tradition which he commanded the Thessalonians to obey, was
   contained in the former epistle addressed to them, where it is said,
   "And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to
   work with your own hands, as we commanded you." 1 Thess. iv. 11. And in
   the quotation from the second chapter, it is clear, that by traditions,
   the apostle did not mean merely oral communications, for he explains
   himself, by saying, "whether by word or epistle." It is not denied,
   that Paul delivered many things orally to the churches, as has been
   already acknowledged. All the instructions given to the churches first
   planted, were oral, for as yet no gospels nor epistles were written;
   but the true point in dispute is, whether any article of faith, or any
   important institution, thus originally communicated, was omitted, when
   the books of the New Testament were written by divine inspiration.
   Whether, while a part of the revelation of God, for the use of his
   church, was committed to writing, another important part was left to be
   handed down by tradition. That the word tradition, as used by Paul,
   makes nothing in favour of the doctrine of the Romish church, is
   evident, because by this word he commonly means such things as were
   distinctly recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, in his first epistle to
   the Corinthians, he says, "For I delivered unto you first of all,"
   where the word for transmitting by tradition, is used; but what were
   those things which he had by tradition communicated to them? He informs
   us in the next words, "How that Christ died for our sins according to
   the Scriptures, And that he was buried, and that he rose again the
   third day, according to the Scriptures." 1 Cor. xv. 3, 4.

   It is manifest, therefore, that the argument derived from the
   exhortation of Paul to obey tradition, is but a shadow, and vanishes
   upon the slightest touch of fair examination.

   2. Their next and principal argument is derived from the frequent
   declarations of the early Fathers in favour of tradition. Cyprian
   refers those who might be in doubt respecting any doctrine, to the holy
   tradition received from Christ and his apostles; and Irenæus, as cited
   by Eusebius, says, "that those things which he heard Polycarp relate
   concerning Christ, his virtues and his doctrines, which he had learned
   from converse with the apostles, he had inscribed on his heart, and not
   on paper." But after a few sentences he informs us "that all which he
   had heard from them was in accordance with the Scriptures, (panta
   sumphona tais graphais.") This sentence of Irenæus is of great
   importance, for it teaches us how the Fathers understood this subject.
   They received such traditions as came down through pious men from the
   apostles, but they compared them with the Scriptures; even then the
   Scriptures were the standard by which all traditions must be judged.
   Irenseus insinuates, plainly enough, that if what he had heard from
   Polycarp, had not been in accordance with the Scriptures he would not
   have considered it as deserving attention.

   But the same Irenæus and Tertullian have spoken in still stronger terms
   in favour of tradition in their controversies with heretics. The
   former, in the third chapter of the third book of his work on Heresies,
   says, "The tradition of the apostles is manifest in the whole world. In
   the church it is exposed to the view of all who are willing to know the
   truth." And in the fourth chapter, "It is not necessary to seek the
   truth from others which can easily be acquired from the church, since
   the blessed apostles have deposited in her, most fully, all those
   truths which are needful, so that every one who will may drink of the
   water of life. This is the true door of life, and all others are
   thieves and robbers; them we should avoid; but those things which
   appertain to the church we should delight in with great diligence, and
   should lay hold of the tradition of truth. For what if the apostles had
   left us no writings, ought we not to follow the order of traditions,
   which they to whom the churches were committed have delivered to us? To
   which institution many barbarous nations have submitted, having neither
   letters nor ink, but having the tradition of the apostles inscribed on
   their hearts, which also they follow."

   Tertullian, in his work concerning "Prescriptions," says, "If Christ
   commissioned certain persons to preach his gospel, then certainly none
   should be received as preachers except those appointed to office by
   him. And as they preached what Christ revealed unto them, what they
   taught can only be known by applying to the churches which the apostles
   planted, by preaching to them, whether viva voce, or by their epistles.
   Therefore, all doctrine which agrees with that held by the apostolical
   churches is to be considered as true and held fast, because the
   churches received it from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, and
   Christ from God; but all other doctrine which is repugnant to that
   received by the churches should be rejected as false, as being
   repugnant to that truth taught by the apostles, by Christ, and by God."

   These declarations from such men in favour of tradition seem, at first
   view, to be altogether favourable to the doctrine of the church of
   Rome; but we despair not of being able to convince the candid reader,
   that when the occasion on which these things were said, and the
   character and opinions of the persons against whom these Fathers wrote
   are considered, their testimony instead of making against the
   sufficiency of the Scriptures will be found corroborative of the
   opinions which we maintain. They do not appeal to tradition, let it be
   observed, for confirmation of articles of faith not contained in the
   Scriptures; but the doctrines which they are defending are among the
   most fundamental contained in the New Testament. They are precisely the
   doctrines which are comprehended in the Apostles' Creed. Now, to appeal
   to tradition for the confirmation of such doctrines as these, never can
   be of any force to prove that other doctrines not contained in the
   Scriptures may be established by tradition. But it may be asked, if
   those doctrines concerning which they disputed are plainly inculcated
   in the New Testament, why have recourse to tradition? Why not appeal at
   once to the Scriptures? To which I would answer, that Irenæus does
   little else in the third, fourth, and fifth books of his work than
   confirm the truth by a copious citation of Scripture.

   Nothing can be more manifest, therefore, than that the matters in
   dispute were not such as could only be proved by tradition, but they
   were such truths as lie at the very foundation of the Christian
   religion, and to record which, the gospels and epistles were written.
   But still the question returns, why did these Fathers appeal for proof
   to tradition, when they had testimony so full and decisive from the
   Scriptures? The answer to this question will show us, in the clearest
   manner, that the views of Irenæus and Tertullian, relative to the
   Scriptures and to traditions, were such as are now held by Protestants,
   and that the heretics whom they opposed, occupied nearly the same
   ground as the Romanists now do, in this controversy. These heretics
   either rejected the Scriptures as being an insufficient rule, and
   asserted that they were not competent for the decision of such matters;
   or they so corrupted them, that it was useless to appeal to them for
   proof; for testimonies derived from the genuine Scriptures they would
   not admit. This is not conjecture; for Irenæus has explicitly stated
   the case. "When," says he, "they are confuted from the Scriptures
   themselves, they allege that they are not correct, or not of authority,
   and assert that they speak so variously, that the truth cannot be
   established by them without tradition; for, say they, it was handed
   down, not by letters, but viva voce." And Tertullian says, "This heresy
   does not receive some parts of the Scriptures; and what they do receive
   is so corrupted by additions, or detractions, to suit their own
   doctrine, that they cannot be said to receive the Scriptures entire,
   &c." Again: "They pretend that the apostles did not wish to reveal all
   things plainly, for while they made known certain truths to all, there
   were others which they communicated secretly, and to a few persons,
   which they say the apostle Paul meant by the depositum."

   From these quotations, the reason why these Fathers had recourse to
   traditions is most manifest. It was the only ground on which these
   heretics could be met; for they denied, (as the Romanists now do,) that
   the Scriptures were a certain and sufficient standard of truth. They
   said that their meaning could not be ascertained without tradition;
   that they were defective; and also, that there were some parts which
   they did not acknowledge; and they held, moreover, that some things
   were never committed to writing, but designedly handed down by
   tradition. We did not, indeed, expect to find the exact doctrine of the
   Romanists respecting the Scriptures and tradition, at so early a period
   of the church: but unfortunately for their cause, the persons who are
   found agreeing with them are gross heretics.

   It is now easy to see why the appeal was made by the Fathers to
   universal tradition; and they show, that in their day tradition and
   Scripture were harmonious; and that if the apostles had written
   nothing, the consent of all the churches would be sufficient to prove,
   that the doctrines which they defended were received from the apostles.
   Instead, therefore, of using tradition, as the Romanists do, to prove
   some doctrine not contained in the Scripture, they used it merely to
   confirm the truths which are manifestly contained in the New Testament.
   They were at no loss for Scripture testimonies to establish these
   truths, but they were disputing with men who did not admit the
   authority of the Scriptures to be decisive, and therefore they appeal
   to universal tradition in support of them. It is said, indeed, by
   Irenæus, that many barbarous nations had received the faith, among whom
   letters and writing were unknown. They must, therefore, it is
   concluded, have received it from tradition. Very good. Just as heathen
   tribes now receive, from those missionaries who preach the gospel to
   them, a short summary of the most important doctrines of the New
   Testament. The truths which these barbarous nations received, were not
   different from those contained in the sacred Scriptures, but the very
   same, taught in a short comprehensive creed. In fact, we have here the
   true origin of that symbol of doctrine, commonly called the Apostles'
   Creed, which was a summary of Christianity, used in very early times,
   in the instruction of those who were not able to read the New
   Testament, or who had, as yet, no access to it. There are extant a
   number of these creeds, which at first were very short; but were
   afterwards increased, as new heresies arose. Bishop Usher found several
   of these in very ancient manuscripts, all of which are substantially
   the same as the creed called the Apostles' Creed.' That Irenæus
   actually referred, in the passage alluded to, to these elementary
   doctrines, he explicitly informs us; for, immediately after mentioning
   these barbarous nations, who were destitute of "letters and ink," he
   adds, "Believing in one God, the maker of heaven and earth, and all
   things which are therein; and in Jesus Christ the Son of God, who for
   his exceeding great love to his creatures, submitted to be born of a
   virgin, by himself uniting man to God; and having suffered under
   Pontius Pilate, and having risen again, was received into heaven; about
   to come again in glory; the Saviour of those who are saved, and the
   judge of those who are judged; and will send into eternal fire, the
   perverters of the truth, and the despisers of his Father, and of his
   coming; which barbarians, if any one should announce to them the
   doctrines invented by heretics, stopping their ears, they would fly far
   away from them. Thus, the ancient apostolical tradition does not
   sanction those monstrous opinions inculcated by heretics."

   In the second chapter of the first book of the same work, Irenaeus
   describes the apostolical doctrine, thus: "The church, planted by the
   apostles and their disciples throughout the whole world, even to the
   ends of the earth, receives the same faith; which is, in one God
   Almighty, the Father, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
   things which are therein; in one Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
   incarnate for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who by the
   prophets, predicted the good will of God; his advent; his generation of
   a virgin; his passion, and resurrection from the dead; and the
   ascension in the flesh of our beloved Lord Christ Jesus; and his coming
   again from heaven, in the glory of his Father, as our Lord Jesus
   Christ; our God, Saviour, and King; before whom, according to the good
   pleasure of the Father invisible, every knee shall bow, of things in
   heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every
   tongue shall confess the justice of his judgments towards all, when he
   will send wicked spirits, fallen and apostate angels, and blaspheming
   men, into eternal fire; but the just and upright who have kept his
   precepts, and persevered in his love, some indeed from the beginning,
   and others as having received the gift of repentance, he will surround
   with eternal glory. This faith, the church spread over the whole world,
   diligently keeps, as if she inhabited one house, and believes in it, as
   if possessing but one soul and one heart; and in accordance with the
   same, she teaches and preaches, as with one mouth. Although the
   languages which are in the world are different, yet there is one and
   the same tradition. Neither do the churches which are founded in
   Germany believe differently from those in Italy, nor from those which
   are in Egypt, or in Libya, or in the middle of the world. But as the
   sun is one and the same through the whole world, so the light and
   preaching of the truth, everywhere shines, and illuminates all men, who
   are willing to come to the knowledge of the truth," &c.

   This then is the apostolical tradition, of which these Fathers speak in
   such high terms: not any secret doctrine, never committed to writing;
   not any articles of faith, or rites of worship, of which no vestige can
   be found in the Bible; but the plain, prominent, fundamental doctrines
   of the Christian religion: the very doctrines contained in the
   Apostles' Creed. That the preaching of the gospel preceded the
   circulation of the Scriptures we admit, but this preaching we insist
   and have proved, contained nothing different from that which is written
   in the gospels and epistles.

   Tertullian speaks to the same purpose, and furnishes us with another
   summary of the common faith of primitive Christians; "The rule of
   faith," says he, "is that by which it is believed, that there is no
   more than one God, and no other beside the Creator of the world, who
   produced all things out of nothing, by his Word, first of all sent
   forth, which Word is called his Son; was seen under different forms by
   the patriarchs; was always heard by the prophets; and finally, by the
   Spirit and power of God, being conceived by the Virgin Mary, became
   flesh in her womb. Jesus Christ having thus become man, published a new
   law, and a new promise of the kingdom of heaven; was crucified; rose
   again the third day; was caught up into heaven; sat down on the right
   hand of God the Father; sent, as his substitute, the power of the Holy
   Spirit, to influence those who believe; will come again in glory to
   take his saints to the fruition of eternal life and of the celestial
   promises, and to adjudge the profane to eternal fire; at which time,
   there will be a resuscitation of both parts, and the flesh will be
   restored. This rule of faith was instituted by Christ, and is
   questioned by none but heretics, and such as teach those things which
   make heretics." [85]

   These are the apostolical traditions which were universally received;
   the very plainest and most fundamental doctrines of the Christian
   religion, which are written amply in every gospel, and recognized fully
   in every epistle. Thus far then, it does not appear that anything was
   left to unwritten tradition, to be communicated to future ages; for
   those very truths which were at first delivered orally by the apostles,
   were afterwards recorded by inspiration; and when the preachers of the
   gospel instructed the ignorant, who were unacquainted with letters,
   they taught them, precisely, but in a summary way, what is written in
   the New Testament.

   3. Another argument, depended on by the advocates of tradition, is
   derived from the fact, that there are some doctrines, not expressly
   mentioned in Scripture, which are universally inculcated by the
   Fathers, which all true Christians have received as articles of faith,
   in all succeeding ages, and which are not denied even by Protestants
   themselves. To this class belong the doctrine of the Trinity; the
   doctrine of the Son being of the same substance as the Father; the
   deity of the Holy Spirit; his proceeding from the Father and the Son:
   the two natures in Christ constituting one person; the baptism of
   infants; the religious observance of the Lord's day, &c. Now, in regard
   to these articles of religion, we observe, that although they are not
   contained in Scripture, in so many words, they may be derived from
   Scripture by legitimate inference; and conclusions fairly deduced from
   the declarations of the word of God, are as truly parts of divine
   revelation, as if they were expressly taught in the sacred volume. All
   the articles mentioned above, are capable of satisfactory proof from
   Scripture; and if we did not find them taught there, we should feel
   under no obligation to receive them. We do not deny, however, that the
   universal consent, and uniform practice of the primitive church, ought
   to have great weight in confirming our faith in important doctrines,
   and in satisfying us that certain things not explicitly mentioned in
   Scripture were practised by the apostles. Although the doctrine of the
   Trinity, and the essential deity of the Son and Holy Spirit, are
   doctrines very plainly taught in the New Testament, yet in a matter of
   such vast importance, it cannot but afford satisfaction to every
   sincere inquirer, to find that these doctrines were universally
   believed by the Fathers, to be taught in the writings of the apostles.

   And although there are principles and facts recorded in the New
   Testament, from which it can be fairly concluded, that the first day of
   the week was set apart for public worship, and that the infants of
   believers were, from the beginning, baptized, and thus connected with
   the visible church; yet, as these institutions are not so expressly
   included in Scripture, as to remove all uncertainty, the fact of their
   universal observance, in the primitive church, has, deservedly, great
   influence in convincing us, that our reasonings and inferences from
   Scriptural principles are correct. But why should we be required to
   receive these things merely on the authority of tradition, when the
   Fathers themselves appealed for their truth to the infallible rule
   contained in the New Testament? Thus, on the subject of infant baptism,
   which the Romanists pretend is derived solely from tradition, we find
   the Fathers appealing not only to universal practice and apostolical
   tradition, but frequently to the words of Scripture, in which they
   believed that the practice was implicitly authorized. Irenæus, Origen,
   Augustine, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Chrysostom, do all appeal to
   Scripture, when treating this subject, although they do, indeed, lay
   great stress on the derivation of this practice from the apostles by
   undoubted tradition. It is not denied, however, that after some time an
   undue deference was paid to traditions. It will be shown hereafter,
   that many were misled from the simplicity of the gospel by this very
   means. By yielding too ready an assent to traditions, they were led to
   adopt false opinions, some of which were directly repugnant to the
   written word. It can have no weight with us, therefore, to adduce such
   a writer as Epiphanius extolling tradition; for it can be proved, that
   from this source he imbibed many foolish notions, and fabulous stories,
   which the more impartial among the Romanists are as far from receiving
   as we are. Nor, do we feel bound, on this subject, to adopt all the
   opinions anywhere found in the writings of Origen, Basil, Augustine,
   &c.; for we are persuaded, that this was one of the errors of
   antiquity, and that it was prolific of numerous evils, by which the
   church of God became greatly corrupted in after times. But it answers
   no purpose to the Romish church to plead these authorities; for they
   themselves do not receive as articles of faith or parts of divine
   worship, all that these Fathers derived from tradition. The principle
   of Protestants ever has been, that the Scriptures contain all things
   necessary to guide the faith and practice of believers; and they feel
   under no obligations to receive any article of religion, which cannot
   be proved to be contained in the sacred volume. If, in the explanation
   of Scripture, light can be derived from tradition, or the universal
   opinion or practice of the primitive church, they are very willing to
   avail themselves of it, as they are to derive aid from any other
   quarter: but since they are convinced that the Fathers were fallible
   men, and actually fell into many mistakes, it would be folly to build
   their faith on their opinions, much more to adopt their errors, knowing
   them to be such. "The Bible is the Religion of Protestants."

   The fact is, that the Fathers generally depended on Scripture for the
   proof of their doctrines; and called in the aid of tradition, only to
   confirm the doctrines which they derived from the written word. And
   here it is important to remark, that tradition, in the earlier and
   purer times of the church, was a very different thing from what it is
   now. Men who lived within one or two hundred years of the apostles, had
   an opportunity of ascertaining their opinions and practices from
   tradition, with a degree of certainty which is utterly unattainable
   after the lapse of ages of error and darkness. If it should be agreed,
   to receive as apostolical everything which the early Fathers professed
   to have received by tradition from the apostles, yet it would be most
   unreasonable to be required to admit as divine, the monstrous mass of
   traditions held by the Romish church, which has been accumulating for
   ages.

   But it is capable of the clearest proof, that great uncertainty
   attended all matters received by tradition, which were not contained in
   Scripture, even in those times that were nearest to the days of the
   apostles. This fact is manifest, in the case of Papias, who was
   contemporary with the last of the apostles; and of Clement of
   Alexandria, who lived in the second century. If then tradition was so
   uncertain, at its very source, who can place any confidence in this
   channel of communication, after it has been increasing in impurity for
   seventeen hundred years? If the stream had even been pure in its
   commencement, it would, by this time, have become so turbid, and so
   poisoned, that no dependence could be placed in the information
   conveyed by it. But where certain things are said to have been received
   by tradition from the apostle John, at second hand, it was deemed
   important to verify them, by a comparison with the Scriptures, as we
   have already seen. How unreasonable then is the demand, that we should
   now receive all traditions, which have come down to us, without any
   test of their genuineness, or any comparison of them with the oracles
   of God!

   Here also it is necessary to observe that there is a wide distinction
   to be made between articles of faith and institutions of worship which
   are obligatory on all, and such modes of worship as were adopted under
   the general rule of "doing all things decently and in order," or from
   notions of expediency, with a view of conciliating those that were
   without. It may be proved, indeed, from the writings of the Fathers
   that many things of this kind existed, which they never thought of
   placing on a level with the faith received from the apostles. And it
   may be here remarked, that it was one of the first and greatest
   mistakes into which the church fell, after inspiration ceased, to make
   too free a use of this doctrine of expediency. The abuses which have
   crept in under this specious disguise were not foreseen. The Fathers
   saw no harm in an indifferent ceremony to which, perhaps, their new
   converts were attached from long custom. By adopting things of this
   kind, the church which was at first simple and unincumbered with rites,
   became strangely metamorphosed; and in place of her simple robe of
   white, assumed a gorgeous dress tricked off with gaudy ornaments and
   various colours. This practice of inventing new ceremonies went on
   increasing until, in process of time, the burdensome ritual of the
   Levitical law was not comparable to the liturgy of the Christian
   church. Who that now attends a Romish chapel on some high day, would
   suppose that the service performed was connected with the religion of
   the New Testament?

   It is of no consequence, therefore, to adduce testimonies of the
   Fathers of the second, third, and fourth ages of the Christian church,
   to show that such ceremonies were then in use in some particular part
   of the church; or even in the church universal. All know by what means
   these things were received and obtained prevalence. But let it be kept
   in memory that the Fathers do not assert that these usages were derived
   from the apostles; nor do they pretend that they were necessary; and
   accordingly we find that in different countries they were not the same.

   4. I come now to consider the last argument for unwritten traditions
   which I have been able to discover. It is this, that without the aid of
   tradition the Scriptures will be of no real benefit to us, because it
   is only by this means that we can arrive at their true meaning. And it
   is alleged that the Fathers in all disputes with heretics, when they
   referred to Scripture, still appealed to universal tradition for a true
   exposition of the meaning of the passages adduced.

   In returning an answer to this argument I would observe, that should we
   even grant all that is contended for, it would not be a concession of
   the main point in controversy. The claim of the Romanists, so
   unblushingly advanced in the decree of Trent already cited is, "That
   traditions relating both to faith and manners, are to be received with
   equal affection and reverence as the canonical Scriptures." And lest we
   should be at any loss to know what articles of faith are pretended to
   be received by tradition alone, Peter a Soto, one of the great
   defenders of the decrees of the Council of Trent, and a member of that
   Council, explicitly declares, "That the rule is infallible and
   universal; that whatever things the Romish church believes and holds,
   which are not contained in the Scriptures, are to be considered as
   derived from the apostles; provided the observances cannot be traced to
   any certain origin or author." Everything in use in this church, of the
   commencement of which we are ignorant, must be ascribed to the apostles
   without doubt, and without further proof! And then he descends to
   particular doctrines and rites which, according to this sweeping rule,
   we must receive as handed down by tradition from the apostles. Among
   these are "the oblation of the sacrifice of the altar, unction with
   chrism or the holy oil, invocation of saints, the merit of good works,
   the primacy of the Roman pontiff, the consecration of the water in
   baptism, the sacrament of confirmation, of orders, of matrimony,
   prayers for the dead, extreme unction, auricular confession, and
   satisfaction," &c. But beside these there are innumerable other things
   which are held sacred by the Romish church which cannot be proved from
   Scripture, such as the mutilation of the Lord's Supper, the celibacy of
   the clergy, the distinction of meats, purgatory, pilgrimages,
   indulgences, the worship of images and relics, the canonization of
   saints, &c. Now, she cannot pretend that all these were received from
   the apostles, for some of them are in direct repugnance to the plain
   declarations of Scripture; and the occasion of the introduction of some
   of them is matter of history, as is acknowledged by the Romanists
   themselves. And surely it is not a very convincing argument of the
   apostolical origin of doctrines or ceremonies, that we do not know when
   they took their rise.

   But the argument now under consideration relinquishes this ground, and
   goes back to the Scriptures as the foundation of faith, but insists
   that the true interpretation of Scripture can only be known by
   tradition. On which we remark:

   That many things in Scripture are so clear that they stand in need of
   no interpretation. They are already as plain as any exposition can make
   them. Who wants tradition to teach him that Christ is the Son of God;
   was born of the virgin Mary; was crucified under Pontius Pilate, rose
   again the third day, and ascended to heaven, whence he will come again
   to judge the world? If we cannot understand the plain declarations of
   Scripture, neither could we understand an exposition. If we cannot know
   what the apostles and evangelists mean in their plainest declarations
   when we have their very words before us, how shall we know what is the
   meaning of the vague language of tradition?

   There are many parts of the New Testament of which tradition has handed
   down no interpretation. If we wish to know their meaning, it is in vain
   that we apply to the Fathers for instruction. They are silent. They
   have not commented on these books and passages. To which of the Fathers
   shall I go for an exposition of the book of Revelation? Or will the
   Pope himself, aided by all his cardinals, or by an oecumenical council,
   undertake to give us the true interpretation of this prophecy? It
   cannot be true that Scripture can be interpreted only by tradition;
   unless we agree to give up a large part of the New Testament as wholly
   incapable of being understood.

   We cannot build our faith on the interpretation of the Fathers, in all
   cases, because they often fall into palpable mistakes, which is not
   denied by the Romanists themselves; and again, they differ among
   themselves. How then can it be known what that interpretation is, which
   was received from the apostles? Must I follow Justin, or Irenæus, or
   Clement of Alexandria? or must I believe in all the allegorical
   interpretations contained in the Homilies of Origen, according to
   which, the plainest passages are made to mean something perfectly
   foreign from the literal sense? If the tradition which brings down this
   interpretation, is not found in the writings of the Fathers, where is
   it? And how has it come down? Surely that which was never mentioned nor
   recorded by the ancient church, ought not to be received as an
   apostolical tradition; for, as the great Chillingworth says, "A silent
   tradition is like a silent thunder," a thing inconceivable. But we
   shall be told, that the church has preserved this deposit, and can
   testify that it was derived from the apostles. What church? And where
   is her testimony? And how do we know that among such a mass of
   traditions, some have not crept in, which originated in other sources
   than the teaching of Christ and his apostles? Who kept these traditions
   securely when the church was overrun with Gothic ignorance and
   barbarism? Who kept this treasure unadulterated, when Arianism was
   predominant? If there be such an oral law, containing an exposition of
   Scripture, how has it happened that there have existed such dissensions
   about doctrine in the Romish church itself? And, as it is acknowledged,
   that many usages of the church have had their origin, long since the
   apostles' days, what authority is there for these innovations? If the
   authority of the church was sufficient to establish these, it could as
   easily establish all the rest, and there is no need of apostolical
   tradition: but if there is a distinction to be made between observances
   derived from the apostles, and such as have been invented by men, how
   can we draw the line between them?

   An implicit believer in the infallibility of the Pope, would deem it
   sufficient to answer, that his holiness at Rome knows certainly what is
   apostolical, and what not; what is obligatory and what not. All we have
   to do, is to believe what he believes, or what he tells us to believe.
   Now, without disputing the pretensions of the bishop of Rome to such
   extraordinary knowledge, at present, I would ask, if we must go to an
   infallible judge to learn what are apostolical traditions, what use is
   there in traditions? Why does not this infallible teacher declare at
   once what is truth in all cases, without the trouble of searching into
   antiquity after traditions, which never can be found?

   But if it be alleged that the traditions which ought to be received as
   the rule of our faith, are such as were universal, and concerning which
   there cannot be any doubt, I answer, that many such traditions may
   indeed be found, but what do they respect? Those very doctrines which
   are most plainly and frequently inculcated in Scripture, and of which
   we need no exposition; for, as was said before, they are expressed as
   perspicuously as any exposition can be. But it affords us satisfaction
   to find the church openly professing, from the beginning, those truths
   which we find recorded in Scripture. If it does not add confirmation to
   our faith in these points, it gives us pleasure to find such a harmony
   in the belief of true Christians.

   Finally, it is dangerous to rely upon traditions. Heretics in all ages
   sheltered themselves under this doctrine. Those with whom Tertullian
   contended, alleged that the apostles did not know everything necessary,
   as Christ declared he had many things to say, which they could not bear
   yet; or there were some things which they did not teach publicly, nor
   commit to writing, but communicated privately to a few chosen persons,
   and therefore they declined the authority of Scripture. The same is
   true of those against whom Irenæus wrote. They appealed from Scripture
   to tradition, and he answers them by showing that universal tradition
   was conformable to Scripture.

   Eusebius informs us that Artemon, who asserted that Christ was a mere
   man, pretended that he had learnt, from tradition, that all the
   apostles were of his opinion. [86] Thus also Clement of Alexandria
   says, "that Basilides gloried in having received his doctrine through a
   few hands from Peter; and Valentinus boasted of having been instructed
   by one who had been a disciple of Paul." [87] The Marcionites professed
   to have received their doctrines from Matthew. The Arians, as appears
   by an oration against them by Athanasius, appealed to tradition for the
   confirmation of their tenets. In fact, this doctrine of unwritten
   traditions has been justly compared, to Pandora's box, which is
   calculated to fill the world with evils and heresies. But not only have
   heretics availed themselves of this corrupt fountain, but good men have
   been deceived by lending too credulous an ear to traditions.

   Papias one of the hearers of John the apostle, was a great collector of
   traditions. He was inquisitive to know what each of the apostles had at
   any time said; and there was some chance at coming at the truth from
   oral tradition, by one who was a hearer of one of the apostles. But
   what valuable information did this good man obtain by all his
   inquiries, which is not in Scripture? Let Eusebius answer, "Papias
   adopted many paradoxical opinions, by giving heed to unwritten
   traditions, (paradoseos agraphou) and received certain strange parables
   of our Saviour, mixed with fabulous things, among which was the error
   of the Chiliasts; by which many other excellent men were deceived,
   paying too much deference to antiquity and unwritten traditions. Even
   such men as Irenæus, Apollinarius, Tertullian, Victorinus, and
   Lactantius, were misled by these ancient traditions, so that they
   adopted an opinion for which there is no foundation in sacred
   Scripture, and not only so, but which is repugnant to the doctrine of
   Christ and his apostles." [88]

   Clement of Alexandria, too, than whom no man of the ancient church was
   more celebrated, speaks of certain persons who had taken much pains to
   preserve the sayings of the apostles handed down by tradition, among
   whom he mentions a Hebrew who is supposed to be Papias; but when he
   comes to tell us what he had learned from these unwritten traditions
   which is not contained in Scripture, it amounts to this, "That there
   was a public doctrine and a secret doctrine; the one exoteric, and the
   other esoteric; that the former was committed to writing, and was in
   the hands of all; but the latter was communicated secretly to chosen
   disciples. And if we may judge of the secret doctrine handed down by
   tradition from some specimens of it which he had learned, we will not
   appreciate unwritten traditions very highly in comparison with the
   written word. Among these is the opinion that the Greek philosophy
   answered the same purpose as the law of Moses, and was a schoolmaster
   to bring those that professed it to Christ; that this philosophy as
   well as the law of Moses was able to justify men, and that there were
   many ways of obtaining life. From the same tradition he teaches that
   Christ's ministry was finished in one year, which opinion Irenaeus
   ascribes to heretics, and declares it as a tradition from John that
   Christ, when he was crucified, was nearly fifty years of age. Clement
   relates it as a tradition, "That the apostles after their death, went
   and preached to the dead, who descended with the apostles into a place
   of water, and then came up alive," and many other like things. [89]

   There is much reason to believe that the corruption of the church,
   which commenced about this time, was owing to a disposition which began
   to be indulged of lending too credulous an ear to traditions, and to
   apocryphal writings.

   But among the Fathers no one gave himself up so entirely to unwritten
   traditions and apocryphal fables as Epiphanius. His writings abound
   with things of this kind; but who would assert that we are bound to
   receive these stories as articles of faith? Even the Romish church with
   all her store of legends, will not receive as true and necessary all
   that is handed down by tradition from one and another of the Fathers.

   From what has been said, therefore, the conclusion is clear that the
   Scriptures are complete without unwritten traditions; that no articles
   of faith, nor institutions of worship, concerning which the Scriptures
   are silent, have come down to us by tradition.; that we have uniform,
   universal tradition on those points which are plainly taught in
   Scripture; that many things pretended to have been received from the
   apostles by tradition cannot be traced to them, and that many other
   things made equally necessary by the Romish church, can be proved to
   have originated many hundred of years since the death of the apostles.
   It has been also shown that there is no certain method of
   distinguishing between what is apostolical, and what has been derived
   from other sources, unless we make the Scriptures our standard; that
   tradition cannot be our guide even in interpreting Scriptures; and
   finally, that tradition has been the common refuge of heretics, and has
   greatly misled good and orthodox men, by inducing them to adopt wild
   theories, fabulous stories, and paradoxical opinions, some of which are
   directly repugnant to Scripture.

   The traditions of the Romish church stand on no higher ground than the
   traditions of the Scribes and Pharisees in the time of our Saviour; but
   he rejected these traditions as having no authority, and as making void
   the law of God. "Why do ye," says Christ, "also transgress the
   commandment of God by your tradition? Thus have ye made the commandment
   of God of none effect by your tradition." Matt. xv. 3-6 "Howbeit, in
   vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
   men." Mark vii. 7. The same questions and reproofs may with equal
   propriety be addressed to the Pope, and the doctors of the Romish
   church. But, say we, "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak
   not according to these, it is because there is no light in them."
   Isaiah viii. 20.

   Thus have we brought this work to a close, and it affords us pleasure
   to believe that most who read these pages will be convinced that the
   Bible is a complete rule, both of faith and practice. "The law of the
   Lord is perfect." Psa. xix. What a treasure have we in the Old and New
   Testament! Here God speaks to us by his "lively oracles." The way of
   life is delineated so distinctly, that the wayfaring man, though a
   fool, shall not err therein. We have, indeed, "a sure word of prophecy
   to which ye do well that ye take heed as to a light shining in a dark
   place until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts." 2
   Pet. 7-19. There is nothing lacking to him that is in possession of the
   Scriptures; for "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
   profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
   in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
   furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17.

   Let us then be grateful to God, and give him unceasing thanks for this
   precious deposit which he has committed to his church, and which, by
   his Providence, he has preserved uninjured through all the vicissitudes
   through which she has passed. Let us praise God that in regard to us,
   that night of darkness is past in which there was a famine, not of
   bread, nor of water, but of the word of the Lord; when the light of
   this brilliant lamp was put out, or rather "put under a bushel," and
   the feeble erring light of tradition was substituted in its place. Let
   us be glad and rejoice that we have lived to see the day when copies of
   the Bible are multiplied, and when many run to and fro to circulate
   them; and let us wait in assured hope for the day when "the knowledge
   of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. Even so,
   come Lord Jesus. Amen."

  FIRST DECREE OF THE FOURTH SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, A. D. 1546.

   "The holy oecumenical and general Council of Trent, legitimately
   convened in the Holy Spirit, under the presidency of three legates of
   the Apostolic see, constantly proposing this before all things, that
   all errors being taken away, the gospel in its purity may be preserved
   in the Church, which was promised before by the prophets in the holy
   Scriptures, but which was promulgated by our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
   of God, with his own mouth; moreover, he commanded it to be preached to
   every creature by his apostles, as the fountain of all saving truth and
   moral discipline: which truth and discipline he provided should be
   contained in the books of Scripture, and in unwritten traditions,
   received from the mouth of Christ by the apostles, or from the apostles
   speaking by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and handed down to us;
   therefore this Synod, following the example of the orthodox Fathers,
   receives and venerates with equal pious affection and reverence, all
   the books both of the Old and New Testament (for one God is the author
   of both:) likewise those traditions relating to faith and manners,
   which were received from the mouth of Christ himself, or from his
   inspired apostles, and which have been preserved in an uninterrupted
   succession in the Catholic Church. Moreover, this Synod judges it
   proper to give a catalogue of the sacred books, lest any doubt should
   arise in the minds of any respecting the books received by them, the
   names of which are here inserted in this decree: viz. the five books of
   Moses--Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Next, Joshua,
   Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of Chronicles, two of Ezra, viz.
   the first and the second, which is called Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith,
   Esther, Job, CL Psalms of David, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes,
   Song of Songs, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Baruch,
   Ezekiel, Daniel, Twelve Minor Prophets, viz. Hosea, Joel, Amos,
   Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah,
   Malachi, two of Maccabees, first and second. Of the New Testament, the
   four gospels, viz. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; the Acts of the Apostles,
   written by Luke the Evangelist; fourteen epistles of the blessed
   apostle Paul, viz. to the Romans; to the Corinthians, two; to the
   Galatians; to the Ephesians; to the Philippians; to the Colossians; to
   the Thessalonians, two; to Timothy, two; to Titus; to Philemon; to the
   Hebrews. Of the apostle Peter, two; of the apostle John, three; of
   James, one; of the apostle Jude, one; the Apocalypse of John the
   apostle.

   "But if any one shall not receive as canonical and sacred all these
   books, with all their parts, as they are used to be read in the
   Catholic Church, and are contained in the old Vulgate Latin edition; or
   shall knowingly and intentionally contemn any of the aforesaid
   traditions, let him be anathema.

   "Hence all may understand in what order and way the Synod, after laying
   the foundation of the Confession of their Faith, will proceed; and what
   testimonies and proofs they will especially use in confirming
   doctrines, and in the reformation of manners in the church."

   Sed nos ad tertium gradum illum considerationem referamus, de quo
   disserere quod Dominus suggesserit atque tractare instituimus. Erit
   igitur divinarum scripturarum solertissimus indagator, qui primo totas
   legerit, notasque habuerit, etsi non dum intellectu, jam tamen
   lectione, duntaxat eas quæ appellantur canonicæ. Nam cæteras securius
   leget fide veritatis instructus, ne præoccupent imbecillem animum, et
   periculosis mendaciis atque phantasmatibus eludentes præjudicent
   aliquid contra sanam intelligentiam. In canonicis autem scripturis
   Ecclesiarum catholicarum quamplurium authoritatem sequatur, inter quas
   sane illæ sunt quæ Apostolicas sedes habere et epistolas accipere
   meruerunt. Tenebit igitur hunc modum in scripturis canonicis, ut eas
   quæ ab omnibus accipiuntur Ecclesiis catholicis, præponat eis quas
   quædam non accipiunt. In eis vero quæ non accipiuntur ab omnibus,
   præponat eas quas plures gravioresque accipiunt, eis quas pauciores
   minorisque authoritatis Ecclesiæ tenent. Si autem alias invenerit a
   pluribus, alias a gravioribus haberi, quanquam hoc invenire non possit,
   æqualis tamen authoritatis eas habendas puto. Totus autem canon
   scripturarum in quo istam considerationem versandam dicimus, his libris
   continetur. Quinque Moyseos, id est Genesi, Exodo, Levitico, Numeris,
   Deuteronomio, et uno libro Iesu Nave, uno Judicum, uno libello qui
   appellatur Ruth, qui magis ad regnorum principia videtur pertinere.
   Deinde quatuor Regum et duobus Paralipomenon, non consequentibus, sed
   quasi a latere adjunctis simulque pergentibus. Hæc est historia quæ
   sibimet annexa tempora continet, atque ordinem rerum. Sunt aliæ tanquam
   ex diverso ordine, quæ neque huic ordini, neque inter se connectuntur,
   sicut est Job et Tobias et Hester et Judith et Maccabæorum libri duo,
   et Esdræ duo, qui magis subsequi videntur ordinatam illam historiam,
   usque ad Regnorum vel Paralipomenon terminatam. Deinde Prophetæ, in
   quibus David unus liber Psalmorum et Salomonis tres, Proverbiorum,
   Cantica canticorum, et Ecclesiastes. Nam illi duo libri, unus qui
   Sapientia, et alius qui Ecclesiasticus inscribitur, de quadam
   similitudine Salomonis esse dicuntur. Nam Jesus filius Sirach eos
   scripsisse constantissime perhibetur. Qui tamen quoniam in authoritatem
   recipi meruerunt, inter Propheticos numerandi sunt. Reliqui sunt eorum
   libri qui proprie Prophetæ appellati sunt, duodecim Prophetarum libri
   singuli; qui connexi sibimet, quoniam nunquam sejuncti sunt pro uno
   habentur. Quorum prophetarum nomina sunt hæc, Osee, Joel, Amos, Abdias,
   Jonas, Michæas, Naum, Abacuk, Sophonias, Aggæus, Zacharias, Malachias.
   Deinde quatuor Prophetæ sunt majorum voluminum, Esaias, Hieremias,

  NOTE D. (Page 131.)

  PASSAGE FROM EUSEBIUS.

   The Order of the Gospels.

   Let us now also show the undisputed writings of the same apostle,
   [John.] And of these his gospel, so well known in the churches
   throughout the world, must first of all be acknowledged as genuine.
   That it is, however, with good reason, placed the fourth in order by
   the ancients, may be made evident in the following manner. Those
   inspired and truly pious men, the apostles of Christ, as they were most
   pure in their life, and adorned with every kind of virtue in their
   minds, but unskilled in language, relying upon the divine and wonderful
   energy granted them by the Saviour, neither knew how nor attempted to
   propound the doctrines of their master, with the art and refinement of
   composition. But employing only the demonstration of the divine Spirit,
   working with them, and the wonder-working power of Christ, displayed
   through them, they proclaimed the knowledge of the kingdom of heaven
   throughout the world. They bestowed but little care upon the study of
   style, and this they did because they were aided by a co-operation
   greater than that of men. Paul, indeed, who was the most able of all in
   the preparations of style, and who was most powerful in sentiments,
   committed nothing more to writing than a few very short epistles. And
   this too, although he had innumerable mysterious matters that he might
   have communicated, as he had attained even to the view of the third
   heavens, had been taken up to the very paradise of God, and had been
   honoured to hear the unutterable words there. The other followers of
   our Lord were also not ignorant of such things, as the twelve apostles,
   and the seventy disciples, together with many others; yet of all the
   disciples, Matthew and John are the only ones that have left us
   recorded comments, and even they, tradition says, undertook it from
   necessity. Matthew also having first proclaimed the gospel in Hebrew,
   when on the point of going also to other nations, committed it to
   writing in his native tongue, and thus supplied the want of his
   presence to them by his writings. But after Mark and Luke had already
   published their gospels, they say that John, who during all this time
   was proclaiming the gospel without writing, at length proceeded to
   write it on the following occasion. The three gospels previously
   written, having been distributed among all, and also handed to him,
   they say that he admitted them, giving his testimony to their truth;
   but that there was only wanting in the narrative the account of the
   things done by Christ, among the first of his deeds, and at the
   commencement of the gospel. And this was the truth. For it is evident
   that the other three evangelists only wrote the deeds of our Lord for
   one year after the imprisonment of John the Baptist, and intimated this
   in the very beginning of their history. For after the fasting of forty
   days, and the consequent temptation, Matthew indeed specifies the time
   of his history, in these words: "But hearing that John was delivered
   up, he returned from Judea into Galilee." Mark in like manner writes:
   "But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee." And Luke,
   before he commenced the deeds of Jesus, in much the same way designates
   the time, saying, "Herod thus added yet this wickedness above all he
   had committed, that he shut up John in prison." For these reasons the
   apostle John, it is said, being entreated to undertake it, wrote the
   account of the time not recorded by the former evangelists, and the
   deeds done by our Saviour, which they have passed by, (for these were
   the events that occurred before the imprisonment of John,) and this
   very fact is intimated by him, when he says, "this beginning of
   miracles Jesus made;" and then proceeds to make mention of the Baptist,
   in the midst of our Lord's deeds, as John was at that time "baptizing
   at Ænon near Salim." He plainly also shows this in the words, " John
   was not yet cast into prison." The apostle, therefore, in his gospel,
   gives the deeds of Jesus before the Baptist was cast into prison, but
   the other three evangelists mention the circumstances after that event.
   One who attends to these circumstances can no longer entertain the
   opinion, that the gospels are at variance with each other, as the
   gospel of John comprehends the first events of Christ, but the others,
   the history that took place at the latter part of the time. It is
   probable, therefore, that for these reasons John has passed by in
   silence the genealogy of our Lord, because it was written by Matthew
   and Luke, but that he commenced with the doctrine of the divinity, as a
   part reserved for him by the divine Spirit, as if for a superior. Let
   this suffice to be said respecting the gospel of John. The causes that
   induced Mark to write his have already been stated. But Luke also in
   the commencement of his narrative, premises the cause which led him to
   write, showing that many others, having rashly undertaken to compose a
   narration of matters that he had already completely ascertained, in
   order to free us from the uncertain suppositions of others, in his own
   gospel, he delivered the certain account of those things, that he
   himself had fully received from his intimacy and stay with Paul, and
   also his intercourse with the other apostles. But this may suffice
   respecting these. At a more proper time we shall endeavour also to
   state, by a reference to some of the ancient writers, what others have
   said respecting the sacred books. But besides the gospel of John, his
   first epistle is acknowledged without dispute, both by those of the
   present day, and also by the ancients. The other two epistles, however,
   are disputed. The opinions respecting the Revelation are still greatly
   divided. But we shall, in due time, give a judgment on this point also
   from the testimony of the ancients.

   The Sacred Scriptures acknowledged as genuine, and those that are not.

   This appears also to be the proper place to give a summary statement of
   the books of the New Testament already mentioned. And here, among the
   first, must be placed the holy quaternion of the gospels; these are
   followed by "the book of the Acts of the Apostles:" after this must be
   mentioned the epistles of Paul, which are followed by the acknowledged
   first epistle of John, as also the first of Peter, to be admitted in
   like manner. After these are to be placed, if proper, the Revelation of
   John, concerning which we shall offer the different opinions in due
   time. These, then, are acknowledged as genuine. Among the disputed
   books, although they are well known and approved by many, is reputed
   that called the epistles of James and Jude; also the "Second Epistle of
   Peter," and those called "the Second and Third of John," whether they
   are of the evangelist or of some other of the same name. Among the
   spurious must be numbered both the books called "the Acts of Paul" and
   that called "Pastor," and "the Revelation of Peter." Besides these, the
   books called "the Epistle of Barnabas," and what are called "the
   Institutions of the Apostles." Moreover, as I said before, if it should
   appear right, "the Revelation of John," which some, as before said,
   reject, but others rank among the genuine. But there are also some who
   number among these the gospel according to the Hebrews, with which
   those of the Hebrews that have received Christ are particularly
   delighted. These may be said to be all concerning which there is any
   dispute. We have, however, necessarily subjoined here a catalogue of
   these also, in order to distinguish those that are true, genuine, and
   well authenticated writings, from those others which are not only not
   embodied in the Canon, but likewise disputed, notwithstanding that they
   are recognized by most ecclesiastical writers. Thus we may have it in
   our power to know both these books, and those that are adduced by the
   heretics under the name of the apostles, such, viz., as compose the
   gospels of Peter, Thomas and Matthew, and others beside them, or such
   as contain the Acts of the Apostles, by Andrew, and John, and others,
   of which no one of those writers in the ecclesiastical succession has
   condescended to make any mention in his works; and indeed the character
   of the style itself is very different from that of the apostles, and
   the sentiments, and the purport of those things that are advanced in
   them, deviating as far as possible from sound orthodoxy, evidently
   proves they are the fictions of heretical men; whence they are to be
   ranked not only among the spurious writings, but are to be rejected as
   altogether absurd and impious. Eccles. Hist. lib. iii. cap. xxiv. xxv.

  NOTE E. (Page 163.)

  GOSPEL OF THE NAZARENES.

   There is no apocryphal book of the New Testament which has been so much
   spoken of, both by the ancients and moderns, as the gospel of the
   Nazarenes. By some, not only of the Romanists, but also of the
   Protestants, it has been exalted very nearly to an equality with the
   canonical books of the New Testament. It seems necessary, therefore, to
   examine its claims with more attention than is requisite in the case of
   other books of this class.

   This gospel was known among the ancients under several different
   titles. It was sometimes called "the gospel according to the twelve
   apostles;" "the gospel of Bartholomew;" "the gospel according to the
   Hebrews;" "the gospel of the Ebionites," &c.

   It is the opinion of some that this is the gospel to which Paul
   alludes, Gal. i. 6, where he speaks of "another gospel." However this
   may be, if we credit Eusebius, we must believe that it existed as early
   as the beginning of the second century; for he represents Hegesippus as
   writing some things concerning "the gospel according to the Hebrews and
   Syrians." [90]

   Clement of Alexandria [91] cites from it the following passage: "He who
   admires shall reign, and he who reigns shall be at ease"

   Origen speaks of it in this manner, "If any one will receive the gospel
   according to the Hebrews, in which our Saviour says, The Holy Ghost my
   mother lately took me by one of my hairs, and led me to the great
   mountain of Thabor.'" And in another place, "It is written in a certain
   gospel, which is entitled according to the Hebrews, (if any one be
   pleased to receive it, not as of authority, but only for illustration
   of the present question,) A certain rich man said to Christ, What good
   thing shall I do that I may inherit life? He said to him, O man, keep
   the law and the prophets; he answered him, That I have done. He said to
   him, Go sell all things that thou hast, and distribute among the poor,
   and come and follow me. The rich man hereupon began to scratch his
   head, and was displeased. And the Lord said unto him, How can you say
   that you have kept the law and the prophets, seeing it is written in
   the law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; but behold, many of
   thy brethren, children of Abraham, are clothed with nastiness, and
   ready to perish for hunger, while thy home abounds with all sorts of
   delicacies, and nothing is sent out of it to them. And turning about,
   he said to his disciple Simon, who sat by him, Simon, son of Joanna, it
   is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a
   rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.'" [92]

   Eusebius, speaking of apocryphal and spurious books, says, "In this
   number some have placed the gospel according to tile Hebrews, with
   which they of the Jews who profess Christianity are very much
   delighted." And speaking of the Ebionites, he says, "They made use only
   of that which is called the gospel according to the Hebrews, very
   little esteeming any others." [93]

   Epiphanius has left several testimonies respecting this gospel, among
   which are the following: "The Nazarenes have the gospel of Matthew most
   entire in the Hebrew language; for this is still preserved among them,
   as it was at first, in Hebrew characters. But I know not whether they
   have taken away the genealogy from Abraham to Christ.

   In another place, speaking of the Ebionites, he says, "They also
   receive the gospel according to Matthew. For this both they and the
   Corinthians make use of, and no other. They call it the gospel
   according to the Hebrews; for the truth is, that Matthew is the only
   one of the New Testament writers who published his gospel and
   preaching, in the Hebrew language and Hebrew characters."

   And again, "In that gospel which they (the Ebionites) have called,
   according to St. Matthew, which is not entire and perfect, but
   corrupted and curtailed, and which they call the Hebrew gospel, it is
   written, That there was a certain man called Jesus, and he being about
   thirty years of age, made choice of us. And coming to Capernaum, he
   entered into the house of Simon called Peter, and opening his mouth,
   said, When I passed by the lake of Tiberias, I chose John and James the
   sons of Zebedee, and Simon and Andrew, and Thaddeus, and Simon Zelotes,
   and Judas Iscariot, and thee Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom,
   I called, and thou didst follow me. I will therefore that ye be my
   twelve apostles, for a testimony to Israel.' . . . . The meat of John
   the Baptist, according to this gospel, was wild honey, the taste of
   which was like manna, or as cakes made with honey and oil. Thus they
   change the true account into a falsehood, and for locusts put cakes
   made with oil and honey." "The beginning of the gospel was this, It
   came to pass in the days of Herod,'" &c. After relating the baptism of
   Christ, as it is recorded in the other gospel, except that it asserts,
   that the voice from heaven saying, This is my beloved Son,' &c., was
   repeated, it goes on to say,' That hereupon John fell down before him,
   and said, O Lord, I pray thee baptize me; but he hindered him, saying
   that it is fit that all these things should be fulfilled.' "See," says
   Epiphanius, "how their false doctrine appears everywhere; how all
   things are imperfect, disordered, and without any truth!" So also
   Cerinthus and Carpocrates, using this same gospel of theirs, would
   prove that Christ proceeded from the seed of Joseph and Mary." [94] But
   the testimony of Jerome respecting this gospel is the most full.
   "Matthew, also called Levi," says he, "who became from a publican an
   apostle, was the first who composed a gospel of Christ, and for the
   sake of those who believed in Christ among the Jews, wrote it in the
   Hebrew language and letters, but it is uncertain who translated it into
   Greek. Moreover, the Hebrew copy is to this time preserved in the
   library of Cæsarea, which Pamphilus the martyr with much diligence
   collected. The Nazarenes, who live in Beroea, a city of Syria, and made
   use of this volume, granted me the favour of writing it out. In which
   gospel there is this observable, that wherever the evangelist either
   cites himself, or introduces our Saviour as citing, any passage out of
   the Old Testament, he does not follow the translation of the LXX, but
   the Hebrew copies, of which there are these two instances, viz. Out of
   Egypt have I called my Son;' and, He shall be called a Nazarene.'" This
   testimony is found in Jerome's life of Matthew. And in his life of
   James we find the following account. "The gospel also, which is called
   according to the Hebrews, and which I lately translated into Greek and
   Latin, and which Origen often used relates, That after our Saviour's
   resurrection, when our Lord had given the linen cloth to the priest's
   servant, he went to James and appeared to him; for James had sworn that
   he would not eat bread from that hour in which he drank the cup of the
   Lord, till he should see the Lord risen from the dead. And a little
   after the Lord said, Bring the table and the bread;' and then it is
   added, He took the bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to
   James the Just, and said to him, My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son
   of man is risen from the dead.'"

   And in a work against Pelagius, he says, "In the gospel according to
   the Hebrews, which is written in the Chaldo-Syriac language, which the
   Nazarenes use, and is that according to the twelve apostles, or as most
   think, according to Matthew, which is in the library of Cæsarea, there
   is the following history: Behold the mother and brethren of Christ
   spake to him; John the Baptist baptizes for the remission of sins; let
   us go and be baptized of him. He said, In what have I sinned, that I
   have need to go and be baptized of him? Unless my saying this proceeds,
   perhaps, from ignorance.' And in the same gospel it is said,' If thy
   brother offend thee by any word, and make thee satisfaction, if it be
   seven times in a day, thou must forgive him. Simon his disciple said
   unto him, What! seven times in a day? The Lord answered and said unto
   him, I tell thee also till seventy times seven.'"

   The same author, in his commentary on Isaiah, mentions this gospel in
   the following manner: "According to their gospel, which is written in
   the Hebrew language, and read by the Nazarenes, the whole fountain of
   the Holy Ghost descended upon him. Besides, in that gospel just
   mentioned we find these things written. It came to pass when the Lord
   ascended from the waters, the whole fountain of the Holy Ghost
   descended and rested upon him, and said to him, My son, among (or
   during the time of) all the prophets, I was waiting for thy coming,
   that I might rest upon thee; thou art my first begotten Son, who shall
   reign to everlasting ages.'"

   And in his commentary on Ezekiel, "In that which is entitled the gospel
   according to the Hebrews, it is reckoned among the chief of crimes for
   a person to make sorrowful the heart of his brother."

   In his commentary on the gospel of Matthew he has the following: "In
   the gospel which the Nazarenes and Ebionites use, which I lately
   translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and which is by most esteemed the
   authentic gospel of Matthew, the man who had the withered hand is said
   to be a mason, and prayed for relief in the following words: I was a
   mason, who got my livelihood by my hands; I beseech thee, Jesus, that
   thou wouldst restore me to my strength, that I may no longer thus
   scandalously beg my bread.'"

   "In the gospel which the Nazarenes use, for the son of Barachiah, I
   find written, the son of Jehoiada." "In this gospel we read, not that
   the veil of the temple was rent, but that a lintel or beam of a
   prodigious size fell down." "In the Hebrew gospel we read, that our
   Lord said to his disciples, Be ye never cheerful, unless when you can
   see your brother in love.'"

   Concerning this gospel according to the Hebrews, very different
   opinions have been expressed by learned men. Some have even pretended,
   that if it was now in existence it would be greatly superior to the
   Greek copy, but generally it has been considered apocryphal, for very
   good reasons, some of which I will now set down.

   1. It was never received by any of the Fathers as canonical, or cited
   as of any authority, by any writer, during the first foul centuries.

   For full proof of the fact here stated, I would refer the reader to
   Jones on the Canon, vol. iii.

   2. This gospel was apocryphal, because it contained several things
   contrary to known and undoubted truths. Of this sort are the passages
   which have been cited respecting Christ's manner of speaking, in regard
   to the baptism of John. Also the account which it contains of the oath
   of the apostle James; for it is evident that the disciples knew nothing
   of Christ's resurrection from the dead until after that event occurred.

   3. A third argument of the apocryphal character of this gospel, is
   derived from the ludicrous and silly relations which it contains--as
   that of the rich man scratching his head, and the Holy Ghost taking up
   Christ by one of his hairs, and carrying him to the great mountain
   Tabor, &c.

   The most probable opinion of the origin of this gospel is, that it was
   a corruption of the original Hebrew gospel of Matthew, by the
   Ebionites. These heretics having this gospel in their possession, and
   having departed from the true faith, mutilated the gospel of Matthew,
   by striking out such things as were unfavourable to their heresy, and
   adding such fabulous stories as suited their purpose. Of the fragments
   which remain, there is not one which agrees exactly with the authentic
   gospel of Matthew. Epiphanius expressly asserts, that the Ebionites
   used the gospel of Matthew alone, and that in Hebrew, but not entire,
   but corrupted and adulterated; and that they had taken away the
   genealogy from the beginning, and commenced their gospel with these
   words, "And it came to pass in the days of Herod," &c.

  PAUL'S EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS.

   Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, to
   the brethren which are at Laodicea. Grace be to you, and peace from God
   the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. I thank Christ in every prayer
   of mine, that ye continue and persevere in good works, looking for that
   which is promised in the day of judgment.

   Let not the vain speeches of any trouble you, who pervert the truth,
   that they may draw you aside from the truth of the gospel which I have
   preached. And now may God grant that my converts may attain to a
   perfect knowledge of the truth of the gospel, be beneficent, and doing
   good works, which accompany salvation. And now my bonds, which I suffer
   in Christ, are manifest, in which I rejoice and am glad. For I know
   that this shall turn to my salvation for ever, which shall be through
   your prayer, and the supply of the Holy Spirit; whether I live or die;
   (for) to me to live shall be a life to Christ, to die will be joy. And
   our Lord will grant us his mercy, that ye may have the same love, and
   be likeminded.

   Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have heard of the coming of the Lord, so
   think and act in fear, and it shall be to you life eternal; for it is
   God who worketh in you; and do all things without sin. And what is
   best, my beloved, rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ, and avoid all
   filthy lucre. Let all your requests be made known to God, and be steady
   in the doctrine of Christ. And whatsoever things are sound, and true,
   and of good report, and chaste, and just, and lovely, these things do.
   Those things which ye have heard and received, think on these things,
   and peace shall be with you. And all the saints salute you. The grace
   of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

  MIRACLES ASCRIBED TO CHRIST IN THE BOOK ENTITLED "THE GOSPEL OF OUR SAVIOUR'S
  INFANCY."

   Christ is represented as speaking in the cradle, and telling his mother
   that he was her son.

   The swaddling clothes in which he was wrapt, when thrown into the fire,
   would not burn. When his parents entered Egypt, in their flight from
   the cruelty of Herod, the girth of the saddle on which Mary rode broke,
   and the great idol of Egypt fell down at the approach of the infant
   Jesus.

   By means of the babe's swaddling clothes, several devils were cast out
   of a boy's mouth, in the shape of crows and serpents.

   A company of robbers, at the approach of Jesus, were frightened by
   being made to hear a sound, as of an army, &c.

   It is related, that a girl was cured of a leprosy by means of water in
   which Christ's body had been washed.

   That a young man, who by witchcraft had been turned into a mule, was,
   upon Christ's mounting him, turned again into a man.

   On one occasion he is said to have turned certain boys, who hid
   themselves from him, into kids, and then at the intercession of their
   mothers restored them again to their proper shape.

   A boy having put his hand into a partridge's nest, to take out the
   eggs, was bit by a serpent, whereupon they brought him to Jesus, who
   directed them to carry him before him, to the place where he had
   received the injury. On coming to the spot, Jesus called for the
   serpent, and it presently came forth; and he said, "Go and suck out the
   poison which thou hast infused into that boy:" so the serpent crept to
   the boy, and took away all its poison again. He also cures his brother
   James, who, in gathering sticks, was bitten by a viper.

   Being one day on the house-top, playing with some boys, one of them
   fell down, and was instantly killed. And the boy's relations came and
   said to the Lord Jesus, "Thou didst throw our son down from the
   house-top;" but he denied it, and said, "Let us go and ask himself."
   Then the Lord Jesus, going down, stood over the dead body, and said
   with a loud voice, "Zeinunus, Zeinunus, who threw thee down?" Then the
   dead boy answered, "Thou didst not throw me down, but such a one."

   Being, on a certain occasion, sent by his mother to the well for water,
   the pitcher broke, and he gathered up the water in his garment, and
   brought it to her.

   When at the age of twelve years Jesus was at Jerusalem, a certain
   astronomer asked him whether he had studied astronomy. Upon which he
   told him the number of the spheres and heavenly bodies, &c. There was
   there also a philosopher, who asked the Lord Jesus whether he had ever
   studied physic. He replied, and explained to him physics and
   metaphysics, the powers of the body, its anatomy, &c. But from this
   time he began to conceal his miracles, and gave himself to the study of
   the law, till he arrived to the end of his thirtieth year.

   See the "Gospel of our Saviour's Infancy," complete in the second
   volume of Jones on the Canon.

  EXTRACT FROM HALDANE'S' EVIDENCE AND AUTHORITY OF DIVINE REVELATION."

   "It has been asserted that the question of the Canon is a point of
   erudition, not of divine revelation.' This is to undermine both the
   certainty and the importance of the sacred Canon. The assertion, that
   the question of the Canon is not a point of revelation, is false. It is
   not true either of the Old Testament or of the New. The integrity of
   the Canon of the Old Testament is a matter of revelation, as much as
   anything contained in the Bible. This is attested, as has been shown,
   by the whole nation of the Jews, to whom it was committed; and their
   fidelity to the truth has been avouched by the Lord and his apostles.
   Is not this revelation? The integrity of the Canon of the New Testament
   is equally a point of revelation. As God had said to the Jews, Ye are
   my witnesses,' and as they received the lively oracles to give unto
   us,' Acts vii. 38, so the Lord Jesus said to the apostles, Ye shall be
   witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and all Judea, and in Samaria, and
   unto the uttermost part of the earth.' The first churches received the
   New Testament Scriptures from these witnesses of the Lord, and thus had
   inspired authority for those books. It was not left to erudition or
   reasoning to collect that they were a revelation from God. This the
   first Christians knew from the testimony of those who wrote them. They
   could not be more assured that the things taught were from God, than
   they were that the writings which contained them were from God. The
   integrity of the sacred Canon is, then, a matter of revelation,
   conveyed to us by testimony, like everything contained in the
   Scriptures.

   "While it has been denied that the question of the Canon is a point of
   revelation, it has been asserted that it is a point of erudition. But
   erudition has nothing farther to do with the question, than as it may
   be employed in conveying to us the testimony. Erudition did not produce
   the revelation of the Canon. If the Canon had not been a point of
   revelation, erudition could never have made it so--for erudition can
   create nothing; it can only investigate and confirm truth, and testify
   to that which exists, or detect error. We receive the Canon of
   Scripture by revelation, in the same way that the Jews received the Law
   which was given from Mount Sinai. Only one generation of the Jews
   witnessed the giving of the Law, but to all future generations of that
   people it was equally a matter of revelation. The knowledge of this was
   conveyed to them by testimony. In the same way Christians, in their
   successive generations, received the Scripture as a matter of
   revelation. The testimony through which this is received, must, indeed,
   be translated from a foreign language; but so must the account brought
   to us of any occurrence, the most trivial, that takes place in a
   foreign country. If in this sense the question of the Canon be called a
   point of erudition, the gospel itself must be called a point of
   erudition; for it, too, must be translated from the original language
   in which it was announced, as also must everything which the Scriptures
   contain. When a preacher inculcates the belief of the gospel, or of a
   doctrine of Scripture, or obedience to any duty, would he be warranted
   in telling his audience that these are questions of erudition, not of
   divine revelation? Erudition may be allowed its full value, without
   suspending on it the authority of the word of God.

   "The assertion that the question of the Canon is a point of erudition,
   not of divine revelation, is subversive of the whole of revelation. We
   have no way of knowing that the miracles related in the Scriptures were
   wrought, and that the doctrines inculcated were taught, but by
   testimony and the internal evidence of the books themselves. We have
   the evidence of miracles, as that evidence comes to us by the testimony
   which vouches the authenticity of the inspired books. As far as the
   genuineness and authenticity of any book are brought into suspicion, so
   far is everything contained in it brought into suspicion. For it should
   always be remembered, that there is no greater absurdity than to
   question the claim of a book to a place in the Canon, and at the same
   time to acknowledge its contents to be a revelation from God. There can
   be no evidence that the doctrines of Scripture are revealed truths,
   unless we are certain that the books of Scripture are revelation. If
   the books which compose the Canon are not matter of revelation, then we
   have no revelation. If the truth of the Canon be not established to us
   as matter of revelation, then the books of which it is composed are not
   so established; and if the books be not so, then not one sentence of
   them, nor one doctrine or precept, which they contain, comes
   established to us as a revelation from God. If, then, the question of
   the Canon be a point of erudition, not of divine revelation, so is
   every doctrine which the Scriptures contain; for the doctrine cannot be
   assured revelation, if the book that contains it be not assured
   revelation. There can be no higher evidence of the doctrine being
   revelation, than of the book that contains it: and thus were not the
   Canon a matter of divine revelation, the whole Bible would be stripped
   of divine authority Anything, therefore, that goes to unsettle the
   Canon, goes to unsettle every doctrine contained in the Canon.

   "Without a particular revelation to every individual, it does not
   appear that the authority of the Canon could be ascertained to us in
   any other way than it is at present. The whole of the Scriptures was
   given at first by revelation, and afterwards this revelation was
   confirmed by ordinary means. The testimony concerning it has been
   handed down to the churches from one generation to another. On this,
   and on their own internal characteristics of being divine, we receive
   the Scriptures with the most unsuspecting confidence, and on the same
   ground the Jews received the Scriptures of the Old Testament. In these
   ways it is fixed by divine authority, and not left in any uncertainty;
   for, if its truth can be ascertained by ordinary means, it is fixed by
   the authority of God, as much as if an angel from heaven were every day
   to proclaim it over the earth. When Paul says, that his handwriting of
   the salutation was the token in every epistle, he at once shows us the
   importance of the Canon, and warrants us in receiving it as a divine
   revelation attested by ordinary means. Those to whom he wrote had no
   other way of knowing the handwriting of the apostle, than that by which
   they knew any other handwriting. Even at that time the churches knew
   the genuineness of the epistles sent to them by ordinary means; and
   Paul's authority warrants this as sufficient. We have, then, the
   authority of revelation for resting the Canon on the ordinary sources
   of human evidence, and they are such as to preclude the possibility of
   deception. The claim of the epistles sent to the first churches, and of
   the doctrine they contain as divine, rested even to those churches on
   the same kind of evidence on which we now receive them. It is very
   important to settle what kind of evidence is sufficient for our
   receiving the Scriptures. Many have rated this too high; and as the
   Scriptures contain a revelation, they wished to have them attested to
   every age by revelation, which is, in fact, requiring the continuance
   of miraculous interference, which it might easily be shown would be
   pernicious."--Pp. 147-150.

   "If it should be asked, Should we be precluded from inquiring into the
   grounds on which the Canon is received? it is replied, Certainly not.
   But we should remember that the permanent ground on which it stands is
   testimony; and such must be the ground of every historical fact.
   Internal evidence may confirm the authenticity of a book sanctioned by
   the Canon, but to suspend belief till we receive such confirmation,
   argues an ignorance of the principles of evidence. A book might be
   inspired, when no such internal confirmation, from the nature of the
   subject, might be found. And when a book is substantially approved, by
   testimony, as belonging to the Canon, no evidence can, by a Christian,
   be legitimately supposed possible, in opposition to its inspiration.
   This would be to suppose valid objections to first principles.
   Sufficient testimony deserves the same rank as a first principle with
   axioms themselves. Axioms are not more necessary than testimony, to all
   the business of human life. Internal evidence may be sufficient to
   prove that a book is not divine; but it is absurd to suppose that such
   a book can have valid testimony, and therefore it can never be supposed
   by a Christian, that any of those books that are received as part of
   the sacred Canon, on the authority of sufficient testimony, can contain
   any internal marks of imposture. This would be to suppose the
   possibility of the clashing of two first principles. The thing that can
   be proved by a legitimate first principle, can never be disproved by
   another legitimate first principle. This would be to suppose that God
   is not the author of the human constitution. If, then, in a book
   recognized by the Canon, as the Song of Solomon, we find matter which
   to our wisdom does not appear to be worthy of inspiration, we may be
   assured that we mistake. For if that book is authenticated by testimony
   as a part of the sacred Scriptures, which the Lord Jesus Christ
   sanctioned, it is authenticated by a first principle, to which God has
   bound us, by the constitution of our nature, to submit. If, in this
   instance, or in any particular instance, we reject it, our own conduct
   in other things will be our condemnation. There is no first principle
   in the constitution of man that can entitle him to reject anything in
   the Song of Solomon, coming, as it does, under the sanction of a first
   principle. Those persons who reject any book of the Canon on such
   grounds, would show themselves much more rational, as well as more
   humble Christians, if, recognizing the paramount authority of a first
   principle universally acknowledged, they would view the Song of Solomon
   and the book of Esther, as any other part of the word of God, and
   humbly endeavour to gain from them the instruction and edification
   which, as divine books, they must be calculated to give. This
   questioning of the Canon, then, proceeds on infidel and irrational
   principles, which, if carried to their legitimate length, must end in
   complete unbelief."--Pp. 153, 4.

   "It is a wonderful circumstance in the providence of God, that while
   the two parts of Scripture were delivered to two classes, with the
   fullest attestation of their divine original, both the one and the
   other have been faithful in preserving the precious trust respectively
   committed to them, while they have both been rebellious in regard to
   that part of which they were not originally appointed the depositaries.
   The Jews always held the books of the Old Testament in the highest
   veneration, and continued to preserve them, without addition or
   diminution, until the coming of Him concerning whom they testify, and
   they have kept them entire to this day; yet they have altogether
   rejected the New Testament Scriptures. And while Christians have all
   agreed in preserving the Scriptures of the New Testament entire and
   uncorrupted, they have wickedly adulterated those of the Old by a
   spurious addition, or have retrenched certain portions of them. Of the
   divine original of the sacred Scriptures, as we now possess them, we
   have evidence the most abundant and diversified. It is the
   distinguishing characteristic of the gospel, that it is preached to the
   poor, and God has so ordered it, that the authenticity of that word by
   which all are to be judged, should not be presented to them as a matter
   of doubtful disputation.

   "Were there no other evidence of the truth of divine revelation than
   the existence of the holy Scriptures, that alone would be conclusive.
   The Bible is not a book compiled by a single author, nor by many
   authors acting in confederacy in the same age, in which case it would
   not be so wonderful to find a just and close connection in its several
   parts. It is the work of between thirty and forty writers, in very
   different conditions of life, from the throne and sceptre down to the
   lowest degree, and in very distant ages, during which the world must
   have put on an entirely new appearance. and men must have had different
   interests to pursue. This would have led a spirit of imposture to vary
   its schemes, and to adapt them to different stations in the world, and
   to different fashions and changes in every age. David wrote about four
   hundred years after Moses, and Isaiah about two hundred and fifty years
   after David, and John about eight hundred years after Isaiah. Yet these
   authors, with all the other prophets and apostles, wrote in perfect
   harmony--confirming the authority of their predecessors, labouring to
   enforce their instructions, and denouncing the severest judgments on
   all who continued disobedient. Such entire agreement in propounding
   religious truths and principles, different from any before or since
   Promulgated, except by those who have learned from them, establishes
   the divine mission of the writers of the Bible beyond dispute, proving
   that they all derived their wisdom from God, and spake as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost. In all the works of God there is an analogy
   characteristic of his divine hand; and the variety and harmony that
   shine so conspicuously in the heavens and the earth, are not farther
   removed from the suspicion of imposture than the unity that, in the
   midst of boundless variety, reigns in that book which reveals the plan
   of redemption. . To forge the Bible is as impossible as to forge a
   world."--Pp. 156, 7.
