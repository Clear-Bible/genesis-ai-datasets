   references read in class. Give out the references before you start
   teaching.
     * KEY WORD--"SALVATION."
     * KEY VERSE--John 3:16.
     * KEY PHRASE--"HOW A LOST WORLD MAY HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE."

   NAME--The word "Bible" from the Greek word "Biblos" means "Book."
   Christians reverently call it "Holy Bible." Our Lord called it "The
   Scriptures," Matthew 22:29. Paul called it the "Holy Scriptures,"
   Romans 1:2, also "The Word of God," 2 Corinthians 4:2.

   The word "Testament" means "Covenant," so we have the Old Testament
   which contains the Covenant and its outworkings, which God gave to
   Israel, and the New Testament which contains the Covenant of Grace
   which came through Jesus Christ.

   The Old Testament was written mostly in Hebrew, and the New Testament
   wholly in Greek.

   WRITERS--At least 40 (from the time of Moses 1500 B. C. to John the
   Apostle 97 A. D.) and the authorship is wonderful. It was written by
   kings and emperors, princes and poets, sages and philosophers,
   fishermen and statesmen. By men learned in the wisdom of Egypt,
   educated in the schools of Babylon, trained at the feet of rabbis in
   Jerusalem. It was written by men in exile, in the desert, and in
   shepherds' tents, amid green pastures and beside still waters. The man
   who wrote one book had no communication with the men who wrote the
   other books. How did these men, writing independently, produce such a
   book. 2 Peter 1:21. Other books get out of date in fifty years. Why
   does this book live on through the ages and keep abreast of mightiest
   thought?Mark 13:31.

   PURPOSE OF THE BIBLE: To record the divine religion which God gave to
   man. Particularly to reveal the sinfulness of man, the holiness and
   love of God and the supreme revelation of that love in Jesus Christ.
   Also to reveal the eternal doom that awaits the wicked and the
   everlasting state of glory that awaits the redeemed.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Books.
    2. Inspiration.
    3. Plan all through the Bible.

  Great Fact I. The Books of the Bible.

   There are 39 books in the O. T. and 27 in the N. T., 66 in all.

   These books are not arranged in chronological order in the Bible, but
   the very order in which they appear has been divinely overruled.

   The O. T. has the following divisions:
    1. The Pentateuch, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy--5
       books.
    2. Historical--Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings,
       1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther--12 books.
    3. Poetical--Job, Psalm, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
       Songs of Solomon (known as Song throughout)--5 books.
    4. Major prophets--Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel--5
       books.
    5. Minor prophets--Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah,
       Nahum, Habakkuk, Zechariah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi--12 books.

   The N. T. has the following divisions:
    1. Biographical, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John--4 books.
    2. Historical, Acts--1 book.
    3. Paul's Epistles, Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians,
       Philippians,
       Colossians, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon--13
       books.
    4. General Epistles, Hebrews, James, 1 & 2 Peter, 1 & 2 & 3 John,
       Jude--8 books.
    5. Prophetical, Revelation--1 book

   There are fourteen books, called the Apocrypha, which are sometimes
   bound in the covers of the Bible. Some of them contain excellent Jewish
   history, but they have never had a place in the Canon, or inspired and
   sacred list of the books of the Bible. "The Scriptures have by their
   own weight crushed all rivals out of existence."

  Great Fact II. The Inspiration of the Bible.

   The Bible was not actually written by the hand of God, but Jesus and
   Paul taught that the scriptures were in the fullest sense inspired.
   Matthew 22:29; 2 Timothy 3:16. The spirit of the inspiration breathes
   in every page and illuminates every word. "Behind and beneath the
   Bible, above and beyond the Bible is the God of the Bible."

   The Spirit of God so influenced the minds of the writers that they
   recorded without error a progressive revelation from God to man.

   That the Bible is fully inspired, and therefore divine, is seen from
   the following facts:
    1. Hundreds of tablets and ancient records unearthed in Bible lands
       testify to the accuracy of Bible history.
    2. No other sacred writings give such a satisfying scheme of
       redemption, and such a scientific account of creation. In the words
       "God hangeth the world upon nothing," Job 26:7; scripture teaches
       that this earth is a planet, floating in space, whereas in the
       writings of the Hindus they claim that the earth rests upon the
       backs of four huge elephants, and they upon the backs of four huge
       turtles, and they upon the backs of four huge snakes, so it is when
       either of these shake themselves that we get earthquakes! Many
       similar illustrations could be given!
    3. Scripture is a testimony to itself. Isaiah 8:20. That the very
       words of the original Greek or Hebrew were inspired, is asserted
       again and again. 2 Peter 1:21; 2 Timothy 3:16; Matthew 5:18. Also
       there are no less than 333 prophecies in the O. T. concerning the
       earthly life of Christ. These were written centuries before they
       were fulfilled. What a ridiculous display of human ignorance they
       would have revealed if they had not been inspired! As a contrast,
       take the many predictions as to the end of the age, made in recent
       years.
    4. The testimony of Christ. He spent the whole of his ministry
       expounding the O. T. scriptures. That He believed them to be
       inspired and without error is seen from Matthew 5:18; John 10:35.
       Furthermore, it is generally admitted that no set of men could have
       written such a wonderful life in the Gospels of an imaginary
       Christ. He must have lived and been all that the Bible pictures Him
       to be. But if He did live, then the Bible is true for Christ and
       the Bible stand or fall together!

  Great Fact III. The Plan all through the Bible.

   (Following Collett.)
    1. The Bible begins, as we would expect it to, with God, Genesis 1:1,
       but it ends with man, the last of God's creations. Revelation
       22:21. But in the middle verse of the Bible, Psalm 118:8, God and
       man separated by sin so far apart, are brought together. This
       indicates that the purpose of the written Word, is the same as that
       of the Living Word (Christ), to bring God and man together.
    2. The Old Testament begins with God, Genesis 1:1. The New Testament
       begins with Christ, Matthew 1:1.
    3. In the Old Testament we have chiefly a revelation of God the
       Father. In the Gospels, of God the Son; in the Acts, of God the
       Holy Spirit; and in the Epistles, of the full Trinity, Father, Son
       and Holy Spirit.
    4. The History of the Bible takes us back into what would otherwise be
       the unknown past. The prophecies take us forward into what would
       otherwise be the unknown future. The spiritual teaching of the
       Bible leads us into what would otherwise be an unknown salvation
       and character.
    5. From Adam to Abraham we have the history of the human race, from
       Abraham to Christ, the history of the chosen race; but from Christ
       on, we have the history of neither the human race, nor the chosen
       race, but of the churches of the living God.
    6. In Eden we had one law given to man,--but it was broken. At Sinai
       the whole law was given to man-but was broken. However, the God-man
       came to earth and perfectly kept the law for man, so that at the
       judgement it should not be a witness against him.
    7. The Old Testament deals chiefly with the law, yet it nevertheless
       contains much of grace Isaiah 53. The New Testament deals chiefly
       with grace, yet it establishes the Law. Romans 3:31.
    8. The law came by Moses, but grace came by Jesus Christ. John 1:17.
       In keeping with this first miracle of Moses was the turning of the
       water into blood, a type of death. Exodus 7:19. While the first
       miracle of Christ was the turning of the water into wine. John
       2:1-11, a type of life and strength.
    9. There is a distinct plan in the individual books of the Bible, for
       example:--In Genesis we have the sacrifice for the
       individual--Abel. In Exodus, for the household--the Passover. In
       Leviticus, for the nation. In John, for the world.
   10. There is progress also in the teachings of the gospels, for Matthew
       closes with the Resurrection, Mark with the Ascension, Luke with
       the promise of the Spirit, and John speaks of His Second Coming.
   11. There is a divine order in the epistles, for James is the epistle
       of WORKS. Paul's of FAITH, Peter's of HOPE, and John's of LOVE!
   12. Comparing the beginning of the Bible with the end, we have:--

   --In the beginning:--
     * God created the heavens and the earth.
     * End--New heavens and new earth.
     * Beginning--Satan enters to deceive.
     * End--Satan cast out that he may deceive the nations no more.

     * Beginning--Sin, pain, sorrow, death.
     * End--no more death, neither sorrow nor crying.
     * Beginning--Tree of life, and man driven away from it.
     * End--Tree of life, and the leaves of the tree for the healing of
       the nations.
     * Beginning--Woman taken from man's side.
     * End--Church taken from Christ's side.
     * Beginning--Earth purged by water.
     * End--Earth purged by fire.
     * Beginning--Paradise lost.
     * End--Paradise regained.

   LESSON--The wonderful inspiration and plan, running through all the 66
   books and 1600 years Of the Bible should so impress us with its divine
   origin, that we should receive it with personal faith, appropriate its
   messages to ourselves, and put our own names in every promise. Only, as
   we read it, believe it, and practice it, shall we be wise, safe and
   holy!

  Lesson No. 2--Take Your Bible to Bible Class for Reading the Scripture Text.

LESSON THEME:--GENESIS

   Genesis 1:1-5 and Genesis 1:26-31.
     * KEY WORD:--"BEGINNINGS."
     * KEY VERSE--Genesis 1:1.
     * KEY PHRASE:--MAN IS BORN AGAIN.

   Home Readings.

   Read the whole book of Genesis this week if possible. Hundreds are
   reading a book a week, if not, then the following selections:
     * Sunday--Creation, Genesis 1:1-5 and Genesis 1:26-31.
     * Monday--Fall, Genesis 3:1-13.
     * Tuesday--Covenant, Genesis 3:13-24.
     * Wednesday--Flood, Genesis 7:7-24.
     * Thursday--Beginning of different languages, Genesis 11:1-9.
     * Friday--Abraham chosen, Genesis 12:19.
     * Saturday--Covenant confirmed to Jacob, Genesis 28:10-22.

   NAME means BEGINNINGS, because it recounts the beginnings of the world
   and mankind. We can trace in it the beginnings of everything--except
   God--who had no beginning.

   The book of Genesis has an importance and interest that no other
   document of antiquity possesses. It embraces the world.

   The marvellous structure of the Bible is built upon this great majestic
   book of Genesis!

   AUTHOR was Moses. Time of writing 1500 B. C. The first five books of
   the Bible were commenced by Moses when, for 40 days, he was on the
   heights of Sinai alone with God. There he was instructed and inspired
   to begin the Bible. There is no record, no reference, and no remains of
   any inspired writings prior to the days of Moses.

   PURPOSE OF THE BOOK--To show how God began to give a Divine Religion to
   mankind. In doing this it was necessary to describe man's primeval
   condition, and his fall into sin which rendered salvation necessary.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Creation.
    2. Fall.
    3. Covenant.
    4. Flood.
    5. Nations.
    6. Patriarchs.

   STORY OF THE BOOK--God created the world and man. Man fell into sin,
   but God made a covenant of salvation with him. In the course of 1600
   years wickedness so increased that God sent the judgement of the Flood.
   The different nations sprang from the three sons of Noah--Shem, Ham and
   Japheth. At the Tower of Babel God confused the tongues of men as a
   result of their pride, and because they failed to spread out. Thus we
   have the origin of nations and languages. God called Abraham to found
   the Israelitish nation and renews the covenant to his son, Isaac, and
   his grandson, Jacob. The book ends with God's chosen people down in
   Egypt, and with the death of Joseph, the great-grandson of Abraham.

   Genesis covers the period 4004 B. C. to 1635 B. C. or 2,369 years.

  Great Fact I. Creation.

   Genesis 1; Genesis 2.

   God created the heavens and the earth, and created man in His own image
   and likeness. The name of God is mentioned 32 times in 31 verses. The
   creative act of God is given as the only sufficient cause of creation.
   Science has no word beyond this. Man is the chief work of creation for
   which all else is brought into being.

   Genesis tells us there is ONLY ONE God, and opposes the doctrine of the
   many gods of the heathen.

   Genesis announces the EXISTENCE of God, and opposes the doctrine of
   Atheism. There is no definition of created things. Everything in the
   universe was created by God and is subject to Him.

   Genesis declares that God EXISTED BEFORE ALL THINGS and apart from all
   things, showing that He is independent of matter.

   Genesis asserts that MAN WAS CREATED, not evolved, thus accounting for
   the moral and spiritual nature in man.

   LESSON. Just as the world was in a state of chaos before God's
   creation--so was man's heart and soul in a state of darkness and chaos
   before the new creation and the new birth.

  Great Fact II. The Fall, Genesis 3.

   The author of sin was Satan, acting through a serpent. The nature of
   sin, was getting man to doubt God's word, His authority and His
   goodness. When tempted to see if man would freely serve God, he failed
   in the test and wanted to be as God himself.

   The results of the Fall were shame and separation from God. The penalty
   of sin was sorrow in the heart, and a curse upon the ground and upon
   nature.

   LESSON--Satan is the cause of all evil now. He still influences man to
   doubt and disobey God. Punishment always has and always will follow
   sin.

  Great Fact III. The Covenant.

   Genesis 3:15.

   Although man fell, a Deliverer is promised, who shall bruise the
   tempter's head. This was fulfilled in John 3:16.

   God also made coats of skins for Adam and Eve, a type of the robe of
   Christ's righteousness provided for sinners.

  Great Fact IV. The Flood.

   Genesis 6; Genesis 7; Genesis 8; Genesis 9.

   Because of man's exceeding wickedness, God sent a Flood that covered
   all the high hills under the whole Heaven. The waters were on the earth
   for 375 days. Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives and
   ceremonically unclean animals by twos and clean animals by sevens, by
   God's direction, entered the Ark and were saved.

   LESSON--God always makes an escape from every judgement, if men have
   faith like Noah, to be saved God's way. There was only ONE Ark, and ONE
   DOOR to the Ark. There is ONLY ONE SAVIOUR, and ONLY ONE WAY TO
   SALVATION--Faith in the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the
   world!

  Great Fact V. The Beginning of Nations.

   Genesis 11.

   The new race instead of spreading out as God commanded, built a city
   and a Tower, at the top of which they placed an idol that they wanted
   the heavens and earth to worship. In judgement for this God confused
   their tongues and scattered them abroad.
     * The race was then divided into nations according to the sons of
       Noah.
     * The sons of Japheth, (the White Gentile race) settled Europe.
     * The sons of Ham, (the Black race) settled Africa.
     * The sons of Shem (the Israelitish and yellow races) settled China
       and the East.

   LESSON--Whenever man shuts God out, and places himself or anything else
   on a pedestal, there is confusion. Prophecy tells us that just before
   the end of the age, anti-Christ will set himself up against God, but he
   will likewise be overwhelmed with judgement.

  Great Fact VI. The Patriarchs.

   Genesis 12; Genesis 13; Genesis 14; Genesis 15; Genesis 16; Genesis 17;
   Genesis 18; Genesis 19; Genesis 20; Genesis 21; Genesis 22; Genesis 23;
   Genesis 24; Genesis 25; Genesis 26; Genesis 27; Genesis 28; Genesis 29;
   Genesis 30; Genesis 31; Genesis 32; Genesis 33; Genesis 34; Genesis 35;
   Genesis 36; Genesis 37; Genesis 38; Genesis 39; Genesis 40; Genesis 41;
   Genesis 42; Genesis 43; Genesis 44; Genesis 45; Genesis 46; Genesis 47;
   Genesis 48; Genesis 49; Genesis 50.

   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph-

   Out of the mass of idolaters, God selects a man named Abraham, to begin
   the history of his chosen people Israel. God sets the race, in general,
   aside for a time, and the blessings He had for it are held over, while
   He chooses a special people, who are to be a channel of blessing to the
   race.

   First, Abraham was chosen in order that God might have a prepared
   people to whom to entrust the Scriptures.

   Second, in order that God might have a channel through whom the
   promised Delivery might come.

   Third, in order that his chosen people might be a witness on earth to
   the other nations

   God made a sevenfold covenant with Abraham that he should be the father
   of a great nation and a company of nations and be a blessing to all the
   world. Genesis 12:1-4; 48:19.

   By faith Abraham was about to offer up Isaac as sacrifice but God
   miraculously delivered Isaac.

   Isaac's son Jacob succeeded his father in the Covenant relationship
   with God. His name was changed to Israel because of his faith and power
   in prayer. Thus we get the name by which God's chosen people were
   called viz., Israelites.

   God permitted Jacob's son Joseph to be sold into Egypt, and Jacob's
   family to later follow him there in order that when a great famine
   prevailed, the Israelites might find food, and at the same time, keep
   themselves as a separate people for God to use later.

   LESSON. God is choosing some and setting aside others.

   Idolaters are put behind God's back but believers are trained in His
   hand for nobler service.

LESSON THEME:--EXODUS

   Exodus 1:7-14.
     * KEY WORD--"REDEMPTION."
     * KEY VERSE--Exodus 3:10.
     * KEY PHRASE--MAN IS REDEEMED OUT OF THE WORLD."

   LESSON THEME:--Home Readings.

   Read the whole of Exodus this week. If not then the following
   selections:--
     * Sunday--Bondage,--Exodus 1:7-22.
     * Monday--Moses Call,--Exodus 3:1-10.
     * Tuesday--First Plague,--Exodus 7:14-25.

     * Friday--Tabernacle,--Exodus 25:1-9.
     * Saturday--High Priest,--Exodus 28:1-14.

   NAME means DEPARTURE, or going out. The book is given this name because
   it relates the deliverance of the children of Israel from bondage in
   Egypt. They had been in Egypt 215 years, and in bondage about 140 years
   of this time. They entered as a family of 70 people, and left as a
   nation of two million. Exodus may well be called "Israel's Birthday
   book!" God calls Israel "My first-born." Exodus 4:22.

   AUTHOR--Moses. Place where written Sinai. Time about 1490 B. C. Book
   cover period 1635-1490 B. C. From death of writings to birth of Moses
   was 63 years, from birth of Moses to Israel's departure from Egypt 81
   years, from departure to erection of Tabernacle, one year.

   PURPOSE--To give the history of the deliverance from Egyptian bondage,
   and the establishment of Israel as God's chosen nation, and the nation
   is set apart to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation, Exodus 19:6.

   The patriarchal Dispensation ends and that of the Law begins.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Bondage.
    2. Moses.
    3. Plagues.
    4. Passover.
    5. Law.
    6. Tabernacle.
    7. Priesthood.

   STORY OF THE BOOK--After the death of Joseph in Egypt, a new king arose
   who oppressed the Israelites. Under these conditions Moses was born.
   His parents defied the king's edict that male children should be
   destroyed, and they hid Moses three months. After being raised as the
   son of Pharaoh's daughter, Moses forsook Egypt, went to the Arabian
   desert as a shepherd, and after 40 years there he was called at the
   Burning Bush to lead Israel out of Egypt. Because of the obstinacy of
   Pharaoh, power was given Moses to send 10 plagues on Egypt. The tenth
   plague was the climax, when the first born of man and beast was
   destroyed among the Egyptians. The Israelites, to commemorate their
   merciful deliverance instituted the Passover feast. The Israelites were
   led through all their difficulties to Sinai, and God provided manna and
   clothing for His people in the wilderness. At Sinai God gives the Ten
   Commandments, the Ceremonial Laws and certain civil laws that were to
   be the basis of their social life. God also instructs them in the
   building of the Tabernacle, and sets up the Priesthood.

  Great Facts. I. Bondage,

   Exodus 1; Exodus 2.

   The Israelites entered Egypt while their kinsman Joseph, was a ruler
   there. While he lived they were happy and prosperous, but later, a
   change of dynasty took place, and the new government viewed their
   increasing numbers with alarm and jealousy. They were oppressed in
   every way by hard labour and cruel taskmasters. They were used as
   slaves to construct great monumental buildings and cities, the ruins of
   which may be seen today. An attempt was made to destroy all male
   children of the Israelites. Satan who is a murderer from the beginning
   showed his cunning and power this way. He desired to destroy the seed
   of Abraham, so as to make the coming of the Promised One impossible.
   The murder of Abel was the first attempt. Here is an effort on a larger
   scale, which was followed by many others.

   LESSON--Egypt is a type of the world. Pharaoh is a type of the prince
   of this world. The bondage of sinners still undelivered is pictured
   here. God is ever listening for the sighs for deliverance. A hatred of
   bondage opens the way for redemption by blood and power.

  Great Fact II. The Birth and Call of Moses,

   Exodus 3; Exodus 4.

   Moses was a descendant of Levi, the third son of Jacob. Moses was in
   danger of death, but his mother prepared an Ark of bulrushes, which
   reminds us of the salvation provided by Noah's Ark. Thus Moses is saved
   by faith which depended upon God's Word and God's power. Name Moses
   means "Saved from water."

   The devil is foiled again, for while Satan was using Pharaoh to destroy
   Israel God was using Pharaoh's daughter to raise up a deliverer

   After 40 years in Egypt, Moses became an exile in the desert of Midian,
   and in the quietness of the desert, and beneath the majesty of the
   mountains, he was prepared to be a vessel fit for the Master's use.
   Thus all great men in communion with their Lord, are trained for
   service.

   At Burning Bush near Sinai, God called Moses to be the deliverer of
   Israel. It was a thorn bush, and thorns being the result of sin it
   typifies the sinfulness and worthlessness of the people. Fire is a
   symbol of their suffering and tribulation. All the fires of persecution
   could not consume Israel. This is true of the Bible, the church and the
   Christian.

  Great Fact III. The Plagues.

   Exodus 7; Exodus 8; Exodus 9; Exodus 10; Exodus 11.

   Because of Pharaoh's refusal to let God's people go, and because he
   hardened his heart, God sent 10 plagues upon him as follows:--
    1. Water turned into blood.
    2. Frogs.
    3. Lice.
    4. Flies.
    5. Murrain.
    6. Boils.
    7. Hail.
    8. Locusts.
    9. Darkness for three days.
   10. Death of first-born.

   The book of Revelation tells us that, after believers have been caught
   up at Christ's second coming that another state of plagues will come
   upon the earth--also that the rejecters of Christ, like Pharaoh, will
   harden their hearts, and thus ripen for the day of wrath.

  Great Fact IV. The Passover.

   Exodus 12.

   In the dreadful night when the angel destroyed the first-born of man
   and beast among the Egyptians, the blood of a slain lamb on the
   door-posts of the Israelites was the sign for the death-angel to pass
   over and spare those homes. In commemoration of this merciful
   deliverance, Israel ever afterwards celebrated the Passover Feast.

   It is the fullest type of Redemption in the Old Testament. It meant:--
    1. Escape from death.
    2. Deliverance from bondage.
    3. Entrance into Canaan--symbolizing our salvation, both from the
       guilt and power of sin, and rest in the tidiness, of Christ. It was
       not character, but the application of the blood, that was required.
       Titus 3:5.

  Great Fact V. The Law.

   Exodus 19; Exodus 20; Exodus 21; Exodus 22; Exodus 23; Exodus 24.

   Israel, numbering two million souls, now assembles in the wilderness at
   Sinai to worship Jehovah, and to receive the law.

   The Law is divided into three parts:--
    1. 1. The Moral Law in the Ten Commandments.
    2. The Ceremonial Law in the ordinance and priesthood. Together they
       form one religious system, called the Law.

   The Ceremonial Law was a provision of Grace for the violation of the
   Moral Law without which the sinner would have met with instant death.
   In the sacrifice, the sinning Israelites had a cover for his sins until
   Christ, the great Antitype of all these sacrifices, should appear to
   put away sin once and for all by the sacrifice of Himself at Calvary,
   Hebrews 9; Hebrews 10; Hebrews 11; Hebrews 12. Since Calvary, God's
   people are not required to keep the ceremonial law.
    1. Civil laws were given which were the basis of their social life,
       and of our modern statutes. These cemented the nation together.

  Great Fact VI. The Tabernacle

   Exodus 25; Exodus 26; Exodus 27.

   Jehovah gave Moses plans for a Tabernacle that was to be the centre of
   Israel's worship for 400 years, until the erection of Solomon's temple.
   It was 185 feet long by 91 1-2 feet wide, and was made up of the:--
    1. The Outer Court, which contained the BRAZENALTAR for Burnt
       Offerings, which typifies our Justification, and also the LAVER,
       where the priests were ceremonially cleansed before entering upon
       their sacred duties. This typifies our Baptism.
    2. The Holy Place, whose was the table of show-bread representing
       Christ, the Bread of Life, as our spiritual food, the GOLDENALTAR
       of incense, symbolizing Christ's intercession for us, and the
       SEVENBRANCHEDCANDLESTICK, representing Christ as our Light.
    3. Holy of Holies, containing the ARK which was sprinkled with the
       Blood of Atonement, once a year, thus making the Ark a MERCY-SEAT
       instead of a Judgement-seat.

  Great Fact VII, The Priesthood.

   Aaron was the first High Priest. The priests were to come from the
   tribe of Levi, and be the descendants from Aaron.

   They were in holy garments, and consecrated to the service of the
   Tabernacle. The support of the High Priest was a tithe paid to him by
   the Levites from the tithes paid to them by the people. The people gave
   one-tenth to the Levites, and the Levites gave one-tenth of what they
   received to Aaron.

   Aaron wore upon his heart the names of the twelve tribes engraved upon
   precious stones. Here we have a blessed type of how Christ carries all
   His people upon His heart of Love!

   With the precious stones, were two called the Urim and Thummim, which
   names mean Lights and Perfections. When the High Priest wanted to know
   God's will about a matter, he would put on the Urim and Thummim, go to
   the Holy Place, and if God was willing to hear him a cloud would hover
   over the Tabernacle.

   The Holy Spirit is the believer's Urim and Thummim, guiding and
   directing all our steps.

   NAME--The book is called Leviticus because it gives fully the functions
   of the Levites, who ministered about the Tabernacle.

   As soon as the Law, which shuts out man from God was given; provision
   was made for access to God apart from the Law altogether. In this book
   the way of access is set before us. Therefore it might also be called
   "the book of access to God."

   AUTHOR--God is the author of this book through Moses. More than any
   other book in the Bible it consists of the words of God. Fifty-six
   times in the twenty-seven chapters in the declaration made, "And God
   spoke to Moses."

   Time of writing, about 1490 B. C. Written at Sinai. Covers a period of
   a month, when Israel was at Sinai.

   PURPOSE--To record the laws concerning the sacrifices and ordinances,
   which were to govern the priests in the service of the Tabernacle.
   Ceremonies were prescribed that were to teach the guilt of man, and the
   holiness of God. The food and sanitary regulations were to be
   distinctive marks of a chosen people. Everything in the book has a
   spiritual significance. The Epistle to the Hebrews should be read in
   connection with it, for there we learn that the Law was a shadow of
   good things to come--the Gospel realities!

   STORY OF THE BOOK--Here the Lord gives His people instructions
   concerning the different sacrifices and offerings. An account is given
   of the consecration of Aaron and his fellow priests, and how they began
   their priestly functions. Then comes the judgement upon Nadad and Abihu
   for presenting strange fire--a sin of presumption. God demands holiness
   from His redeemed people, so the record is given of the Day of
   Atonement. Different feasts are divinely appointed, and the Sabbath,
   Sabbatic Year and the Jubilee Year are instituted.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Sacrifices.
    2. Consecration.
    3. Holiness.
    4. Feasts.
    5. Institutions.

  Great Fact. I. Sacrifices.

   Leviticus 1; Leviticus 2; Leviticus 3; Leviticus 4; Leviticus 5;
   Leviticus 6; Leviticus 7.

   The Burnt, Meal, Peace, Sin and Trespass Offerings

    1. The Burnt offering presented the idea of an atonement, and provided
       the way for reconciliation with God.
    2. The Meal offering was a Thanksgiving offering.
    3. The Peace offering represented fellowship and communion with God.
    4. The Sin offering suggests Christ on the Cross in the sinner's
       stead.
    5. The Trespass offering reminds us that Christ also atoned for the
       trespasses we commit against others.

   All of the offerings of the old Testament fall under one of these five
   heads. The offering of bullock, sheep, goat, turtle dove or pigeon, was
   determined by the ability of the offerer.

   These sacrifices did not in themselves satisfy God. They were object
   lessons to a people in spiritual youth, and pointed to the person and
   sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   LESSON--Because of the holiness of God man in his sin is excluded from
   His presence and can be accepted only on the ground of the shed blood
   of the divine sacrifice.

  Great Fact. II. The Consecration of the Priests.

   Leviticus 8; Leviticus 9; Leviticus 10.

   No one was permitted to bring his own offering to God, it was necessary
   for a priest to stand between man and God. Neither could the priest
   consecrate themselves, it was done by Moses, acting for God. All that
   the priests could do was to present themselves. So with us, see Romans
   12:1.

   When the priests presented themselves they were cleansed, clothed,
   anointed, their hands filled, and food given them, the very experience
   of the believer.

   LESSON--Christ is not only our Saviour, but our High Priest. He and He
   alone, is the only one appointed to stand between the sinner and God.
   We approach god today, not by means of any priest on earth, but through
   our great High Priest, even Jesus, who is now at the right hand of the
   Father.

  Great Fact. III. Holiness Demanded.

   Leviticus 11; Leviticus 12; Leviticus 13; Leviticus 14; Leviticus 15;
   Leviticus 16;
   Leviticus 17; Leviticus 18; Leviticus 19; Leviticus 20; Leviticus 21;
   Leviticus 22.

   The word "Holy" occurs 87 times, and has reference to:--
    1. Food.
    2. Disease
    3. Personal Habits.

   One reason for those laws concerned the health and morals of the
   people. Only that which was clean in the divine estimate was to be
   their food. So God prescribes His Word as the most suitable spiritual
   food for His redeemed people.

   Another reason points to the design of God to keep Israel a separate
   nation. The Holy One demands that His people, whom He has redeemed and
   made high, must be a holy people.

   Leviticus 16; is the great Atonement chapter of the Bible. On the Day
   of Atonement, and only on this day of the year, the High Priest entered
   the Holy of Holies. He also transferred the sins of the people to the
   scapegoat, which bore them away into the wilderness--a type of the work
   of Christ. He not only lays down his life for our sins, but bears them
   away, so that they can nevermore be found, Isaiah 43:25.

  Great Fact. IV. The Feasts.

   Leviticus 23.
    1. Feasts of Passover,
    2. Pentecost,
    3. Tabernacles, and
    4. Trumpets.

   The Passover was held in the spring, and commemorated the saving of the
   first-born in Egypt. It lasted one day and was immediately followed by
   the feast of Unleavened Bread (seven days), making together one feast
   of eight days.

   The Passover typifies redemption, and the Unleavened Bread a Holy Walk,
   Galatians 5:7-9.

   Pentecost was observed 50 days after the Passover, and was a hind of
   Harvest Home service. The first-fruits were then laid upon the altar,
   Leviticus 25:21. It was 50 days after Christ's resurrection, that the
   early Christian had the Day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit came
   upon the church.

   The Feast of Trumpets was the New Year's day of the civil year, and
   began about the first of October. This feast is prophetical and points
   to the future regathering of dispersed Israel.

   The Feast of Tabernacles was held in the Fall and lasted 7 days. It
   commemorated the 40 years spent in the wilderness. It was observed by
   living outdoors in booths and huts, and by special offerings. The feast
   looked forward to the Millennium, when Israel will keep the feast with
   rejoicing, Zechariah 14.

  Great Fact V. The Institutions.

   Leviticus 25.
    1. The Sabbath was the seventh day of the week, and was a day of rest
       and worship, celebrating the finished work of creation. Christians
       keep the first day a the week, because our Lord rose from the dead
       on that day, we thus celebrate the finished work of redemption.
    2. The Sabbatic Year was every seventh year, which was to be a Sabbath
       of rest for the land. Leviticus 25:4. It did the land good to lie
       fallow one year in seven. It reminded Israel of God's ownership and
       their stewardship. It quickened their trust and thanksgiving. The
       neglect of this law was cue of the causes of captivity.
    3. The Jubilee Year was every fiftieth year, Leviticus 25:10.
       Individuals who had gotten into bondage were freed and land that
       had been seized from its rightful owner for debt had to be
       returned. No syndicate was to own vast tracts of land.

   This typifies the final restoration of Israel, their lands, and the
   restitution of all things at the coming of the Lord, Acts 3:21.

   ALL THROUGH THIS WONDERFUL BOOK we see that sacrifice alone is the
   basis and holiness the garment, necessary for the sinner in his
   approach to God.

   NAME--This book is called Numbers because it is an account of the
   double numbering of the people, first at Sinai,--Numbers 1., and
   afterwards at Moab,--Numbers 26. It is also the book of the wilderness
   journeyings of Israel. It is the story from Sinai to the plains of
   Moab.

   AUTHOR--Moses. Time of writing about 1450 B. C. Covers period from 1490
   to 1450 B. C. About 40 years.

   PURPOSE--To give an account of the providential care of the Almighty
   over the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness and the
   temptations and murmurings there, by which they provoked and offended
   their Heavenly Protector so that at length He swore that they should
   not enter the Promised Land.

   STORY--In this book Moses numbers and marshals the tribes, dedicates
   the altar and the Levites. gives sundry laws about the Passover. The
   guiding cloud comes down over the Tabernacle and then begins the
   journey from Sinai to Moab. At Kadesh-Barnea Israel murmured and lost
   faith in God, bringing upon themselves 38 more years of wandering.
   Korah, Dathan and Abiram rebelled against Moses and were destroyed by
   an earthquake. Miriam dies in the desert of Zin. Moses smites the rock
   instead of speaking to it thus forfeiting his right to enter Canaan. In
   judgement for bitter murmurings, God sent fiery serpents among the
   people, the sting of which was healed by looking at the Brazen Serpent.
   Balaam, false prophet, was the cause of Israel falling into idolatry. A
   new generation of Israelites was numbered. The law of vows was given.
   Six cities of refuge were set up for slayers to flee to and find
   shelter.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Preparation.
    2. Unbelief.
    3. Gainsaying.
    4. Water.
    5. Serpent.
    6. Balaam.
    7. Refuge.

  Great Fact I. Preparation.

   Numbers 1; Numbers 2; Numbers 3; Numbers 4; Numbers 5; Numbers 6;
   Numbers 7; Numbers 8; Numbers 9; Numbers 10.

   The covenant has been made, the law given; the Tabernacle set up, the
   priests consecrated. The nation must now be schooled in the law and be
   prepared for its great work.

   Hence in the beginning of Numbers we have the numbering and arrangement
   of the Tribes and assignment of special Tabernacle duties to the
   Levites.

   Israel is moving again towards the Promised Land. There is to be hard
   fighting and every male from 20 years old upward able to bear arms is
   enrolled in the army and trained for Holy War.

   Then every Israelite must know his own tribe and family for the time
   when the land of Canaan should be divided among the tribes. also that
   the genealogy of the promised Messiah might be known.

   Again an orderly host could march more conveniently and would be better
   prepared for conflict with enemies.

   LESSON--The types of Numbers all bear on Christian walk and service.
   Genesis is the book of the Creation and Fall. Exodus of Redemption,
   Leviticus of Worship and Fellowship, and Numbers of that which should
   follow, Walk and Service.

   Christians are walking through the wilderness. In Ephesians 4:1-3 we
   are exhorted to walk worthy of our calling in all lowliness and
   meekness with long suffering, thus making known to all around us the
   excellence of Him who has called us from darkness into His marvellous
   light.

  Great Fact II. Unbelief.

   Numbers 10; Numbers 11; Numbers 12.

   Israel was now facing the Land which was only a short distance away.
   Their history now, however, is marked by murmurings and rebellions,
   justifying. Psalm 96:10. "Forty years long was I grieved with this
   generation."

   There was judgement by lightning (fire of the Lord) because of the
   people's complaining. Then Israel murmured again because of the
   monotony of the daily manna, so the Lord sent a flock of quails, flying
   three feet above the earth, that they might slay them for food. Miriam
   and Aaron became jealous of Moses, and Miriam was smitten with leprosy
   for seven days.

   Twelve men were sent to spy out the Promised Land, but they, (Caleb and
   Joshua excepted) brought back such an evil report, that the people,
   discouraged and faint of heart, lost faith in God and refused to enter
   Canaan. See Hebrews 3:19. This brought about another 38 years of
   wandering in the wilderness.

   LESSON--The people had faith to come out of Egypt (the world) but had
   not faith to enter their Canaan of rest, yet the wilderness of unbelief
   is a hard place for Christians to wander in. God opens doors to nations
   and to individuals. If they fail to discern their opportunity, or take
   prompt advantage of it, they are either shut out altogether, or enter
   after long delay and heavy toil. To know when to go forward is no small
   part of Christian wisdom and virtue.

  Great Fact III. Gainsaying of Korah.

   Numbers 14.

   Korah, Dathan and Abiram then rebuked Moses and Aaron, saying that the
   children of Israel were kept in spiritual subjection and were denied
   their rights. Korah was doubtless sincere, but he blasphemously
   intruded upon the Priest's office. Moses referred the matter to the
   Lord, and God sent an earthquake so that the earth swallowed up all who
   rebelled.

   LESSON--We must learn the peril of discontent and of unholy ambition.
   All assaults made upon Christ's salvation and Christ's priestly work
   must fail. Christ is the only mediator between God and man and if
   anyone shall set himself up in Christ's place he is a revolting rebel
   and will be punished.

  Great Fact IV. Water from the Rock.

   Numbers 20.

   Israel gets in distress because of the shortage of water and bitterly
   murmured against Moses and Aaron. God recognized their need and bade
   Moses to speak to a rock and it should give forth water. Moses,
   however, stung by the reproaches of the people, and in fit of anger and
   unbelief, called the people rebels and smote the rock He therefore was
   forbidden to enter the land of Canaan and died later on Mt. Nebo.

   LESSON--Even saints do not stand every test, the best of men make
   mistakes. but God is so Impartial that even "friends of God" like Moses
   are punished for their sins. Christ, like the rock, was once smitten
   for our sin and like this rock needs not be smitten again.

  Great Fact V. The Brazen Serpent.

   Numbers 21.

   Israel now battles with the Canaanite; and fretful because they have to
   march around the land of Edom instead of through it, and loathing the
   manna again they spoke against God and against Moses

   In judgement for this, God sent fiery serpents among them and many
   people died. When they repented, the Lord caused Moses to make a brass
   serpent and set it upon a pole and everyone that was bitten, when they
   looked upon it, lived.

   LESSON--The whole human family hag felt the serpent's sting which
   results in. death. The sufferers are helpless, no human remedy avails.
   In man's extremity God sends a saviour in the likeness of the sinner,
   as the brazen serpent was in the likeness of the fiery serpent. Then by
   simple faith; healing, life, and happiness came to the sinner. See John
   3:14 and 15.

  Great Fact VI. Balaam.

   Numbers 22.

   Moab was sore afraid of Israel. So Balaak, its king, plotted to get
   Israel under a curse. He therefore sought the services of Balaam who
   was originally a heathen magician who had been deeply impressed by the
   wonderful deeds of God for Israel. He resolved to serve Jehovah and to
   perform his own enchantments henceforth in Jehovah's name. Such a
   combination of heathen magic with the service of Jehovah could not last
   long.

   At first Balaam refused to go the help of the king of Moab. When he did
   go an angel appeared in the path and stopped the ass upon which Balaam
   was riding. He got angry and smote the ass, then the Lord opened the
   mouth of the ass and it rebuked Balaam.

   Balaam refused to curse Israel, but according to Numbers 31:16 and
   Revelation 2:14 he was the cause of Israel falling into fornication and
   idolatry with the people of Moab.

   LESSON--Balaam is a type of men who will sell their Christian influence
   for social and political prestige.

  Great Fact VII. Cities of Refuge.

   Numbers 35.

   Order having been given, the land of Canaan is divided among the
   tribes. Six cities are to be set aside as the cities of refuge for any
   man that killed another unawares. A kinsman would pursue a slayer to
   the city of refuge, which would shelter him. The death of the High
   Priest resulted in the liberty for all those who were in these cities
   and they could return to their possessions. Thus God impressed upon
   them the sanctity of life.

   LESSON--Israel's history can be read in connection with the cities of
   refuge. They shed innocent blood of Christ and are therefore kept out
   of their inheritance--the Holy Land. The cities of refuge, like
   salvation, were of divine origin, were a great necessity to sinful man,
   were near to every man, and were sufficient shelter. "In Christ there
   is no condemnation."

   NAME--Means Second Law or second giving of the Law. It is a summary of
   the whole law and wisdom of Israel, but omitting the things which
   relate to the priests and Levites, includes only such things as the
   people generally are required to know. The book might be called the
   Book of Review. Deuteronomy is noteworthy because it furnished our Lord
   with the three scriptures with which He defeated Satan in His
   wilderness temptation, (Matthew 4:4) viz., Deuteronomy 8:3; 6:16;
   10:20.

   Author--Moses. (The last chapter relating Moses' death is by Joshua.)
   Place: The Plains of Moab. Date about 1450 B. C. Time covered in the
   book is about two months, including thirty days of mourning for Moses.

   The first five books of the Old Testament are called the Pentateuch,
   meaning five hooks. They were all written 15.0Â°1450 B. C. Moses was
   the writer but not the author. Over five hundred times in the
   Pentateuch occur such expressions as "The Lord spoke," and "God said,"
   etc. The divine author was the Holy Spirit.

   PURPOSE--To review the journeyings of the children of Israel to a new
   generation of the people, to rehearse the covenant laws and to impress
   upon the people the blessing of obedience and the curse of
   disobedience.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Remembrance.
    2. Teaching.
    3. Pleading.
    4. Covenant.
    5. Farewell-

  Great Fact I. Remembrance.

   Deuteronomy 1; Deuteronomy 2; Deuteronomy 3.

   Israel is still in the wilderness, but the forty years of wanderings
   are almost ended. In a month they are to cross over the Jordan. Moses
   realizing that he must soon die, called the people together and gave
   them five wonderful addresses to prepare them for possessing the land.

   In the first address Moses reviews their wanderings and reminds them of
   God's faithfulness in that the Lord God has been with them and that
   they lacked nothing, Deuteronomy 2:7.

   In tender language he likens God to a Father and a nurse who carried
   His children as little ones, lest they should be hurt in the
   wilderness, injured by the heat or lost in the darkness. Thus to them
   God was a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. In spite of their
   frequent faults and failures, God's constant care embraced every need
   of their lives for He led, fed, clothed, kept, and brought them to
   their desired haven.

   LESSON--No one can review the history of Israel without being impressed
   with this thought. How man tries God and how God bears with man.

   Precious verses: Deuteronomy 1:11; Deuteronomy 1:3-31; Deuteronomy 2:7;
   Deuteronomy 4:2.

  Great Fact II. Teaching the Law.

   Deuteronomy 4-26.

   In Mores' second address he teaches the Ten Commandments to the new
   generation and shows that they are the basis of right living
   (Deuteronomy 5; Deuteronomy 6). He then impresses the duty to avoid all
   idolatry and the need of humbleness before God that they may not fall
   into the sin of self-righteousness and be destroyed as were their
   fathers, (Deuteronomy 7; Deuteronomy 8; Deuteronomy 9; Deuteronomy 10;
   Deuteronomy 11). He then reminds the people that there is only one
   sanctuary and warns them against false prophets. Laws as to clean
   animals and tithing are given. Feasts of the Passover and the
   Tabernacles are emphasized, because they speak of the redemption and
   regathering of God's people.

   The priest's due from the people is given, Deuteronomy 18:13. Rules as
   to who should go to war, inquests, divorce, social and domestic
   relations, and as to crimes against society are all proclaimed.

   LESSON--The world could not be run without God and His laws. So long as
   Israel sought to keep God's law He watched over them for good and
   prospered them. God's laws are meant to keep us from harming ourselves
   and hurting others. Obedience to them creates moral and spiritual
   uprightness and gives peace, hope and power.

  Great Fact III. Pleading for Obedience.

   Deuteronomy 27; Deuteronomy 28.

   In Moses' third address he pleads for obedience because,
    1. It will magnify and perpetuate God's law;
    2. Enable them to enter into a larger inheritance. Every day they
       tarried outside the land there were more enemies to overcome and
       more blessings would be missed;
    3. Provide cause rejoicing. "Thou shalt rejoice before. the Lord thy
       God." Active co-operation with the divine will is necessary to our
       soul's salvation.

   LESSON--God's obedient people have a clear conscience, they know they
   are pleasing God. They enjoy what they have as the loving gifts of a
   father's hand. They delight to use what they have for Him. They know
   that being shaped by His providence they are becoming better, wiser and
   holier.

  Great Fact IV. The Palestine Covenant.

   Deuteronomy 29; Deuteronomy 30.

   Moses now reminds the people of the Covenant, God gave to Abraham and
   renewed at Sinai, that they should inherit the land. However, he warns
   them, and foretells that disobedience would bring dispersions, but if
   when dispersed among the nations, they should repent, then God would
   gather them again. The conversion of the Jews and the restoration of
   their land are both guaranteed in the covenant, and judgement will be
   meted out to Israel's oppressors and natural prosperity restored to
   Israel. All of this at our Lord's second coming, Acts 15:16.

   LESSON--Let us pray for the restoration of God's people to their land.
   Watch the movements of God's province and heed the cautions of Romans
   11:12-15. The casting off of Israel has meant the reconciliation of the
   world, but the Gentiles must exercise humble faith or they too may be
   cast off.

  Great Fact V. Moses' Farewell and Benediction.

   Deuteronomy 31; Deuteronomy 32; Deuteronomy 33; Deuteronomy 34.

   The final words of Moses are full of tenderness and affection. He
   stool, a hundred and twenty years old, a witness to the grace of God.
   His eye was not dim not had he any marks of feebleness.

   Before he goes up on Nebo's quiet mountain to sleep in the Everlasting
   Arms, he encourages the people to trust in the Lord and assured them of
   triumph, for "He it is who doth go with thee, He will not leave thee
   nor forsake thee." Joshua is called and Israel is told that he should
   bring them into the land. Moses then utters a great song which is full
   of prophecy. He tells of the future failures of Israel, also of their
   future glories.

   He then pronounces sacred and precious blessings upon the tribes.

   Read the golden verses, Deuteronomy 31:2; Deuteronomy 32:10;
   Deuteronomy 33:3; Deuteronomy 33:12; Deuteronomy 33:25-27; Deuteronomy
   34:10.

   LESSON--Moses is one of the supremely great men of the world whose life
   will inspire us to find salvation in the sacrifice God provided, to be
   Holy as God is Holy, and to let all love issue in obedience.

   NAME--This book is named for its author, the principal
   character--Joshua. He was born in Egypt in slavery and came out at the
   Exodus. All through the journeyings he was the co-labourer of Moses,
   ever loyal to his leader, and one of his most trusted and valiant
   captains.

   AUTHOR--Joshua. The elders who outlived him wrote the account of his
   death. Time of writing about 1425 B. C. Events cover period 1450-1425
   B. C.-25 years. From the crossing of the Jordan to the death of Joshua
   and the dividing of the land among the tribes.

   PURPOSE--To give an account of the settlement of the children of Israel
   in Canaan thus proving the faithfulness of God in fulfilling the
   covenant with Abraham, that his seed should possess the land

   It stands in somewhat the same relation to the Pentateuch as The Acts
   of the Apostles to the Gospels While the Pentateuch gives the origin
   and principles of Judaism and the Gospels those of Christianity, in the
   books of Joshua and of Acts we see these principles in action.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Spying.
    2. Crossing.
    3. Conquering.
    4. Retreating.
    5. Renewing.
    6. Dividing.

  Great Fact I. Spying the Land.

   Joshua 1; Joshua 2.

   After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness because of unbelief, the
   Israelites came to the east side of the Jordan, and are about to cross
   over and possess the land. Joshua has succeeded Moses and is a man of
   great faith, courage and fidelity in the discharge of his leadership.

   The Canaanites were the descendants of Canaan, one of the sons of Ham.
   They occupied Canaan and were utterly wicked and depraved and had
   fallen into heathenism and vice. God warned them in the destruction of
   Sodom and Gomorrah but they did not heed. He is now about to destroy
   them and give their land to Israel. Their destruction was both a
   punishment to them and a protection to other peoples around them.

   Joshua, who had been one of the twelve spies, now sends two spies to
   view the land and particularly Jericho. Rahab, who had heard of the
   wonderful miracles wrought for Israel, prayed for mercy for herself and
   her father's house, hid the spies, helped them over the city walls and
   placed scarlet rope in her window so that her home might be identified
   and spared when the city was destroyed.

   LESSON--The scarlet line speaks of safety through sacrifice, Hebrew
   9:19-22.

   Rahab living in a condemned city was not saved by her character but by
   her faith.

  Great Fact II. Crossing the Jordan.

   Joshua 3; Joshua 4.

   Guided now, not by the pillar of fire, but by the Ark (God's presence
   remains with them although the sign of it has been withdrawn). Israel
   prepares to cross the Jordan into the Promised Land. It was a momentous
   crisis in her history, so God, as at the Red Sea, dams back the water
   and the people pass over dry shod. As a memorial of this divine favour,
   Joshua. commanded a man of each tribe to take a rack from the bed of
   the river and set up the stones as a monument of thanksgiving.

   LESSON--Gratitude in the Old Testament was testified by outward signs.
   There was circumcision, Passover, etc.--all memorials of God's love.
   Memorials stir LIP questions and prevent past history from sinking into
   oblivion. Thus our Independence and Thanksgiving days. The Lord's
   Supper is our spiritual stone of remembrance. It was ordained to
   refresh our memories of, and warm your cold hearts to, Calvary.

  Great Fact III. Conquering Enemies.

   Joshua 5; Joshua 6.

   Before advancing on Jericho, Israel was commanded to renew the covenant
   of circumcision with Jehovah, and to keep the Passover. How the blessed
   memories of this feast must have assured them of God's presence and
   power against their present foes. Jericho is now besieged for seven
   days. Each day for six days the city was marched around by the fighting
   men preceded by the Ark carried by the priests.

   On the seventh day the city was compassed seven times. The priests blew
   the trumpets, the people shouted, the walls of the city fell down and
   all of the inhabitants were destroyed except Rahab and her family. All
   Israel did was to carry out simply and faithfully the directions of God
   and they won a complete victory.

   LESSON--Spiritual victories are won by ways and means that seem utterly
   foolish to the wisdom of the world, 1 Corinthians 1:17-29. The walls of
   Jericho like the hindrances in our life are terrifying but they cannot
   withstand the Lord and Ills power.

  Great Fact IV. Retreating from Ai.

   Joshua 7; Joshua 8.

   Joshua now sends his men against a much smaller and weaker place--Ai,
   only to retreat in sore confusion. There is a traitor in the
   camp--Achan who, although forbidden to do so, bad taken a goodly
   Babylonish garment, 200 shekels Of silver and a wedge of gold from the
   spoils of Jericho, bringing disaster upon himself and others.

   LESSON--Unjudged and unforgiven sin in the believer or in the churches
   causes much weakness and injury. We need to pray, Psalm 139:23-24.

  Great Fact V. Renewing the War.

   Joshua 9; Joshua 10; Joshua 11; Joshua 12.

   The second time in battle, Israel triumphs over Ai, makes a treaty with
   the Gibeonites who played a trick on them, and routs the allied army of
   five kings with the help of a great hail storm and miraculously
   prolonged daylight. When Joshua said the sun stood still it is his way
   of stating the phenomenon that, in answer to the prayer, God stopped
   the earth from rotating on its axis for 24 hours. Prof. Totten of Yale
   has published calculations to show that one day in the earth's history
   was 48 hours long. Mark 11:23-24.

   The name Jerusalem is mentioned for the (first time in the Bible. It
   has since become the most famous place in the world and the Crusaders
   shed rivers of blood trying to capture it.

   The kings of the north formed a second confederacy but in divine might
   Joshua overcomes them all, and the land rested from war.

   LESSON--The destruction of the Canaanites is a foreshadowing of the
   great destruction that shall surely come upon the wicked.

  Great Fact VI. Dividing the Land.

   Joshua 12; Joshua 13; Joshua 14; Joshua 15; Joshua 16; Joshua 17;
   Joshua 18;
   Joshua 19; Joshua 20; Joshua 21; Joshua 22; Joshua 23; Joshua 24.

   Nine and one-half tribes have their portion on the west side of the
   Jordan, and, two and one-half on the east side. (Reubenites and Gadites
   and half tribe of Manasseh.)

   The Cities of Refuge mentioned in Numbers and Deuteronomy are now set
   up. "Then the Lord gave them rest and victory." "There failed not ought
   of any good thing the Lord had spoken." All God's promises will in due
   time be made good. After eight years rest in the land Joshua, knowing
   the time of his departure is at hand, calls the people together and
   exhorts them to be faithful, and warns them of the results of apostasy.

   The covenant is again renewed, and Joshua in memorable words calls upon
   Israel "To choose you this day whom you will serve."

   He stands a noble and sublime figure among them, and gives his
   testimony "That as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." At the
   age of 110 Joshua died. What a tribute to him that it is said "and
   Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua."

   LESSON--In view of all that God has done for us we ought reverently and
   heartily to pledge ourselves to serve the Lord. Canaan with all its
   treasures speak to us of the Christian's present inheritance. Victory
   must come before enjoyment.

   NAME--The name was given to the 15 judges who ruled Israel from the
   death of Joshua to Saul the first eking of Israel. Two of them, Eli and
   Samuel, are not mentioned in this book but in First Samuel. Since
   coming out of Egypt Israel had been under the leadership of two great
   men--Moses and Joshua. The tribes had common in-treats and met their
   common dangers unitedly. After the two great leaders died, the tribes
   were scattered over the land and faced their problems and foes
   separately. Then as emergencies arose God would raise up Judges who
   would rally the people against their enemies. The Judge was a
   combination of a military leader and religious reformer. Often he led
   just a few of the tribes, sometimes more than one Judge ruled at the
   same time. In this book, the tribes rather than the nation are the
   view.

   AUTHOR--Samuel. Time of writing about 1100 B. C. Events cover period
   1425-1100 B. C., or 325 years.

   PURPOSE--To give the history of Israel during the Dark Ages and to
   prove that the troubles through which the people went were the
   consequences of their unfaithfulness to the covenant. Judges also sets
   forth the readiness of God to accept repentance and to grant
   deliverance.

   Two facts stand out--the frequent backslidings of Israel and the
   constant grace of God.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Omission.
    2. Commission.
    3. Discipline.
    4. Deliverance.

  Great Fact I. Omission.

   Judges 1; Judges 2; Judges 3.

   Six times it is declared that Israel drove not with the Canaanites.
   Through a lack of vigorous effort and strict obedience to the command
   of God they failed to exterminate these wicked people of the land. They
   tolerated their corrupt life, habits and religion, although they were
   out of harmony with God's law. Toleration was followed in a few years
   by admiration, which was in turn followed by imitation. The Canaanites
   were a cause of future trouble and a constant temptation to idolatry
   and immorality. Israel went to the land like a farmer establishing
   himself on uncleared soil. He clears just enough to support himself at
   first, leaving the rest as it was. When a tribe was caught off its
   guard, these natives swept down taking it captive and placing it under
   bondage.

   LESSON--We must not neglect God's will for worldly conveniences. It is
   dangerous to associate with evil company when we can avoid it. Psalm
   1:1. The Canaanites remaining in the land are a type of sins remaining
   in the heart of the Christian. They lurk in the corners of life. By the
   Holy Spirit's -presence and help let us drive them all out.

  Great Fact II. Commission of Sin of Idolatry.

   Judges 3; Judges 4; Judges 5; Judges 6; Judges 7; Judges 8; Judges 9;
   Judges 10;
   Judges 11; Judges 12; Judges 13; Judges 14; Judges 15; Judges 16.

   The sin of omission is followed by the sin of commission, for the book
   records seven backslidings, seven servitudes and seven deliverances.
   Israel intermarried with the heathen, worshipped their idols and
   practiced their vices. The one land that should have been free from
   idol groves and (heathen altars and corruption was in danger of being
   engulfed.

   The very people who were called out by God to end these abominations
   were perpetuating them.

   LESSON--Social failure is rooted in religious backslidings. Israel's
   abandonment of God was punished by God's abandonment of Israel. This
   may seem a small thing at first sight, but we see that within a short
   time their enemies overran the land and had them completely at their
   mercy. We do not recognize as we should that we are guided and guarded
   by Divine goodness hour by hour.

  Great Fact III. Discipline in Servitude.

   God's discipline of Israel was severe. The highways were deserted,
   lawlessness abounded, so that men had to find their way by stealth to
   evade the highway robbers who filled the land. Some took refuge in the
   caves, some were hunted upon the mountains. Israel had bent its neck to
   the low religion of the heathen, now it was compelled to bend its neck
   to the rule of the heathen.

   LESSON--God's punishments are always curative, aimed at bringing people
   back to a consciousness of sin and of God. It is said of the eagle,
   that when her young ones are full-fledged and yet would prefer to
   linger in downy ease, she breaks up the nest twig by twig, to urge her
   young to leave the nest and soar high amid the sunshine of heaven. Thy
   must fly or die. Thus God takes away our comforts when they lead to our
   spiritual loss.

  Great Fact IV. Deliverance from Foes.

   The Judges were rough and rugged heroes. The seven greater were:--
     * Othniel who delivered the Israelites from the Mesopotamians.
     * Ehud, who delivered the Israelites from the Moabites.
     * Shamgar, who delivered the Israelites from the Philistines.
     * Deborah and Barak, who delivered the Israelites from the
       Canaanites.
     * Gideon, who delivered the Israelites from the Midianites.
     * Jepthah, who delivered the Israelites from the Ammonites.
     * Samson, who delivered the Israelites from the Philistines.

   Gideon was afraid of himself but when assured that God was on his side
   he then with 300 men, lamps and pitchers and trumpets, gallantly
   triumphed over the great army of his enemies.

   Samson was the Hebrew Hercules. His birth was announced by an angel. He
   was a Nazarite who constantly broke his separation vows. He was called
   of God to judge Israel yet did no abiding work because of his lack of
   consecration. He was, however, a man of mighty faith in difficult
   times.

   LESSON--Repentance always brings deliverance. Over every dark chasm
   swings the rope of salvation.

   Deliverance is the keynote in the "New Song" of all the blood-bought
   millions on earth and in heaven.

   NAME--The book is named for its chief character--Ruth, a woman of Moab,
   who became an ancestress of the Messiah.

   AUTHOR--Samuel. Time of writing 1100 B. C. The events probably occurred
   during the rule of Gideon, 1249 B. C.

   This charming story should be connected with the early chapters of
   Judges as it gives us a picture of life in Israel at that time.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To establish the lineage of David. the ancestor of Christ.
    2. The adoption of Ruth into the family of Israel is a prophecy of the
       adoption of the Gentiles into Christ's family. The Moabite, shut
       out by law, is admitted by grace.
    3. To show that God knows all about our private affairs, and that "the
       steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord."

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Choosing.
    2. Gleaning.
    3. Resting.
    4. Rejoicing.

   STORY OF THE BOOK. In the days when the Judges ruled, a severe drought
   drove Elimelech and Naomi and their two sons from their home in
   Bethlehem, across the Jordan to the land of Moab. Here their sans
   married Ruth and Orpah, women of Moab. Elimelech and his sons died,
   leaving the women to widowhood. In her loneliness, Naomi returned to
   her native land. Before doing so she bade a tender farewell to her
   daughters-in-law, and urged them to return to their fathers' homes.
   Orpah did this, but Ruth, who had become a worshipper of the true God,
   replied in the matchless words of Ruth 1:16.

   Naomi and Ruth go to live in Bethlehem, and Ruth gleans in the wheat
   and barley field of Boaz Later on, Boaz falls in love with Ruth and
   marries her. To the union was born Obed, the grandfather of David.

  Great Fact I. Choosing

   Ruth 1.

   Ruth was born a heathen, but through her husband or Naomi, had learned
   of the true God. When the cross-roads of decision came into her life,
   she firmly and speedily decided to forsake her idol; and the corrupt
   life of the Moabites, and to serve the true and living God, Her choice
   was affectionate and final. She clung to the Lord as devotedly as she
   did to Naomi.

   LESSON--There comes a time for us all to take the Lord for our God, and
   His people for our people. It is possible as it was with Orpah, to go a
   long way towards being a Christian, but to kiss Christ and to leave
   Him. But we must say, "Farewell, Moab, Welcome Canaan, Farewell World,
   Welcome Saviour." We must be not almost, but altogether decided for
   Christ. "Without a murmur I dismiss, My former dreams of earthly bliss,
   My joy, my consolation this, Each hour cling to Thee."--Mrs. Elliot.

   A negro in making his confession of Christ, said, "I have got safe past
   de go back corner. I'm gain' all de journey home, and if you don't see
   me at the first of them twelve gates up there, just look on the next
   one, for I'm bound to be dere."

   Are you beyond the "go-back corner?"

  Great Fact II. Gleaning

   Ruth 2.

   Ruth was eager to work, so went forth to glean in the grain fields of
   Boaz, whose name means Redeemer.. ale, "a mighty man of wealth," is a
   beautiful type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ruth had a claim on Boaz
   through he father-in-law, Elimelech. Our claim upon Christ is through
   the Holy Spirit. Boaz noticed the new worker, and graciously bade her
   to stay in his fields, and instructed the young men to let some
   handfuls of golden grain fall purposely for her. The Redeemer provided
   for her, an evidence of His love.

   LESSON--Where hast thou gleaned today? Have we gleaned in His Word, for
   the handfuls He has purposely dropped for us? What have we gathered
   from the fields of truth and grace? The world also is a field. Have we
   gleaned in it the past week for precious sheaves for the heavenly
   garner?

  Great Fact III. Resting.

   Ruth 3.

   Naomi thought that Boaz was the nearest kinsman of Ruth, and therefore
   according to the Mosaic law, was under obligation to marry. Ruth. Naomi
   Therefore advised her to remind Boaz of this obligation by resting at
   his feet.

   LESSON--This should encourage us to rest by faith at the feet of
   Christ, for He is our near kinsman, having taken our flesh upon
   Himself, and become bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh.

   Christ promises rest, and gives rest. As with Mary, it is good for us
   to be at His feet, yea, it is a blessed truth that rest is found only
   at the feet of the Redeemer.

  Great Fact IV. Rejoicing.

   Ruth 4.

   Boaz found that there was a kinsman nearer by blood than he. He
   therefore called the elders of the city into conference, offered the
   other kinsman the right to redeem the inheritance and to marry Ruth. He
   was unable to do this and in token of release, plucked off his shoe and
   gave it to Boaz. This custom arose from the fact that when anyone took
   possession of land he did so by treading on the soil, and asserting his
   right of possession by standing upon it in his shoes. The taking off of
   the shoe and handing it to another was a token of renouncing one's
   right in his favour.

   Boaz now marries Ruth, past sorrows were blotted out, and her happiness
   was crowned by the birth of Obed, who was in the Messianic line.

   LESSON--The powerless redeemer is a type of the law, which is unable to
   redeem us from the curse of sin. Ruth's case was hopeless from the
   point of law, Grace alone could help, and this grace is blessedly seen
   in Boaz. Great are the rejoicings of the righteous when they enter into
   all the privileges of redemption.

         Lesson No. 10--Everyone Should Read and Study the Whole Bible.

LESSON THEME:--1 SAMUEL

   1 Samuel 8:7-22.
     * KEY WORD--"MONARCHY."
     * KEY VERSE--1 Samuel 8:5.
     * KEY PHRASE--"A KINGDOM FOR GOD."

   Home Readings.

   All of First Samuel or:
     * Sunday--Ark brought back, 1 Samuel 7: 1-8.
     * Monday--Saul Anointed, 1 Samuel 10:1-7.
     * Tuesday--Samuel's Stewardship, 1 Samuel 12:115.

     * Saturday--Jonathan protects David 1 Samuel 20:1-24.

   NAME--The two books of Samuel constitute one story and receive their
   name from Samuel because he is the prominent figure and author of the
   first few chapters.

   AUTHOR--Samuel of the first 24 chapters, and the prophets Nathan and
   Gad of the remainder. The writing was concluded soon after Solomon's
   death about 940 B. C. Events cover period from 1100-1017 B.C., or 83
   years.

   PURPOSE--To give the history of Israel under the last two Judges--Eli
   and Samuel, and under their first king, Saul, and to show why the
   government was changed to a monarchy.

GREAT CHARACTERS:--

    1. Eli.
    2. Samuel.
    3. Saul.
    4. Jonathan.
    5. David.

  Great Men, I. Eli.

   The book opens with Eli as both Judge and priest, the first time the
   offices had been combined in the history of Israel. He Judged the
   people for 40 years. His sons Hophni and Phinehas, also priests, acted
   so outrageously, that they excited the deepest disgust. Eli did not
   sternly rebuke, but only gently chided them for their greed and
   immorality. He was therefore warned of the downfall of his house,
   During the next invasion of the Philistines, the Israelites were badly
   defeated, the Ark of God was captured and his sons both killed. When
   Eli learned this news, the shock killed him and he died at the age of
   98. He was a good man and full of humility and gentleness, but weak and
   too indulgent.

   LESSON--Indulgent parents are cruel to themselves and to their
   children. National life is grounded on the development of the life of
   the family, therefore parents should exercise due restraint over their
   children, and children should submit to the restraint of their parents.
   This will produce industry, virtue, contentment and success, in the
   individual life and in the nation. Exodus 20:12.

  Great Men II. Samuel.

   1 Samuel 3; 1 Samuel 4; 1 Samuel 5; 1 Samuel 6; 1 Samuel 7; 1 Samuel 8;
   1 Samuel 9;
   1 Samuel 10; 1 Samuel 11; 1 Samuel 12; 1 Samuel 13; 1 Samuel 14; 1
   Samuel 15; 1 Samuel 16.

   Samuel, a descendant of Levi, was born at Ramah in answer to prayer,
   and was consecrated to God by his mother. He was the last of the judges
   and first of the prophets. He was upright and fearless in his
   administration, was founder of the school of the prophets and of the
   monarchy. He is one of the noblest figures in the Old Testament, whose
   private and public record was not marred by one unworthy act. Moses
   under God was founder of the Theocracy Samuel was the founder of the
   Monarchy.

   God had intended that Israel should become a great nation under His own
   immediate reign, but Israel wanted to be like the nations around them
   and have an earthly king. The evil conduct of Samuel's sons, who were
   deputy judges, encouraged this ambition. Samuel convened the nation at
   Mizpah. The Ark is returned to Israel after 20 years. Saul is
   proclaimed king, and Samuel gives an account of his administration and
   charges the people to fear the Lord.

   LESSON--Samuel's exalted character was due to his being established in
   religious principles in early life. He became a model of integrity in
   office. He never enriched himself nor sought the praise of men.

   Let us always choose men for public office who have a like standard of
   honour and justice.

  Great Men III. Saul.

   1 Samuel 9; 1 Samuel 10; 1 Samuel 11; 1 Samuel 12; 1 Samuel 13; 1
   Samuel 14;
   1 Samuel 15; 1 Samuel 16; 1 Samuel 17; 1 Samuel 18; 1 Samuel 19; 1
   Samuel 20;
   1 Samuel 21; 1 Samuel 22; 1 Samuel 23; 1 Samuel 24; 1 Samuel 25; 1
   Samuel 26;
   1 Samuel 27; 1 Samuel 28; 1 Samuel 29; 1 Samuel 30; 1 Samuel 31.

   It was prophesied in Deuteronomy 17:14-20, that Israel should have a
   king. God, however, did not intend him to be an autocratic but a
   theocratic king, acting always under divine guidance. Saul, to Israel,
   was a man after Israel's own heart, so after Samuel had anointed him
   privately, he was accepted publicly. He was a tall, brave, modest man
   and made a splendid start. He soon however, manifested much of
   self-will, for he intruded on the priest's office and disobediently
   spared the spoils of the Amalekites, and therefore was rejected of God.

   An evil spirit now troubles Saul so that in stubbornness and jealousy
   he seeks the life of David. In a battle with the Philistines, Saul and
   his sons were killed. Thus closes under a shadow a life that had a
   glorious promise.

   LESSON--In proportion as a man lives for himself or for God, he becomes
   weak, sinful and miserable, or strong, holy and happy. Natural
   qualities must be sanctified for them to be a power for good.

   Divine grace when persistently resisted is withdrawn, leaving the soul
   to be troubled by an evil spirit. When grace is humbly and faithfully
   received, it is followed by more grace. Think of the end of Saul and be
   wise! Think of the end of Saul of Tarsus and be happy.

  Great Men IV. Jonathan.

   1 Samuel 14; 1 Samuel 15; 1 Samuel 16; 1 Samuel 17; 1 Samuel 18; 1
   Samuel 19; 1 Samuel 20.

   Jonathan was the eldest son of Saul, and his father's right hand in all
   his battles. With only an armour-bearer, Jonathan surprised a
   Philistine outpost at Gibeah which led to complete victory for Israel.
   However, he came near being put to death by his father for eating
   before evening against an edict of the king, Jonathan is best known for
   his devoted friendship with David, which led him, not only to take
   David's part against Saul, but also made him willing to surrender his
   own claim to the throne of Israel. In the battle with the Philistines
   he fell with his father.

   Jonathan was one of the finest spirits who ever lived. So brave and
   unselfish and such a friend to David, that he is one of the knights of
   chivalry that we should all imitate. David and Jonathan were one in
   love of virtue and the fear of God. It is natural for men to set up
   social ties, but in real friendship there must be a complete union of
   feeling on all subjects, accompanied by appreciation and affection.

   David's life will be considered in the next lesson.

   NAME--Named like First Samuel, after Samuel the last of the Judges and
   the first of the prophets.

   AUTHOR--The prophets, Nathan and Gad. Time of writing 940 B. C. Covers
   the period from 1017 to 977 B. C. About 40 years.

   PURPOSE--To give the history of David, his character, his reign, his
   failures and achievements, revealing a kingly man.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Shepherd.
    2. Prince.
    3. Exile.
    4. King.

  Great Fact I. David as Shepherd.

   1 Samuel 16; 1 Samuel 17.

   David, the son of Jesse and great-grandson of Ruth and Boaz, was born
   in Bethlehem. He was the youngest of eight sons, brave and devout
   spirit. When he was 18, Samuel was divinely directed to anoint him king
   to succeed Saul. In early life he shepherded his father's flocks,
   skilfully guiding them and bravely defending them from wild beasts.

   His fame as a harpist led him to be called to the court of Saul. He
   next slays Goliath, but having passed from boyhood to manhood since the
   king saw him he is not recognized.

   LESSON--The shepherd life developed fearlessness and faithfulness in
   David and gave him time for devout meditation. He thus learned of the
   Good Shepherd who always sought the good of the flock and was ready to
   lay down his life for the sheep. Out of this experience he wrote Psalm
   23. He learned also how to keep his temper, so that when his older
   brother, Eliab, taunted him he was able to rule his own spirit. Under
   the same conditions let us remember that the conflict is not with the
   scorner but with ourselves. In the fight with Goliath he showed
   wonderful faith, reasoning that the God who had helped him conquer the
   lion and bear would make him more than conqueror now. When special
   difficulties come to us let us remember former deliverances and so
   labour and pray, that labour and prayer will overcome all things.

  Great Fact II. David a Prince at Court.

   1 Samuel 18; 1 Samuel 19; 1 Samuel 20.

   David wins the love of Jonathan, Saul's son, and is promoted to a high
   command in the army, but his success makes Saul jealous so that he
   makes five attacks upon David's life.
    1. He spoke to Jonathan and all his servants that they should kill
       him.
    2. He threw a spear at his head, 1 Samuel 19:10.
    3. Sent for David to be brought to him on a sick bed. 1 Samuel 19:15.
    4. Sent messengers to seize him at Ramah, 1 Samuel 19:20.
    5. Went to Ramah himself after David, 1 Samuel 19:23-24. Saul also
       flung a spear at Jonathan in his rage at their friendship.

   LESSON--David was delivered from all these dangers and wrote the 59th
   psalm and many others like it testifying that God was his defence and
   refuge in those days of trouble. When we read these stern Psalms we
   must remember that danger and treason were all around him so that he
   was mightily stirred. As the farmer waits for the harvest let us rest
   in the Lord and wait patiently for Him, for evil-doers shall he cut
   off. Read Psalm 37, which is the good man's medicine for hard times and
   hard places and the antidote for impatience.

  Great Fact III. David, the Exile.

   1 Samuel 21; 1 Samuel 22; 1 Samuel 23; 1 Samuel 24; 1 Samuel 25; 1
   Samuel 26;
   1 Samuel 27; 1 Samuel 28; 1 Samuel 29; 1 Samuel 30; 1 Samuel 31.

   He flew to Nob where he wrongly persuaded the high priest to give him
   the showbread. Went westward to Gath where he pretended to be crazy and
   was driven out by the king. Psalm 34 records this escapade. Returning
   to the land of Judah he takes refuge in the cave of Adullum and becomes
   a captain of troops of sympathizers. Psalms 52; Psalm 57; Psalm 142;
   bear this date. At Engedi David finds Saul asleep and instead of
   killing him only cut off part of his robe. This generous act of mercy
   touches Saul's heart for a time.

   At Carmel, David threatens but afterwards spares the life of greedy
   Nabel whom he had protected from robbers, but who wouldn't give him
   food. After this time Samuel dies and Psalm 63; is written. David
   spares Saul's life the second time and goes to live among the
   Philistines for 16 months. Psalm 56; was written. Saul and his three
   sons having been killed by the Philistines, David's exile ends.

   LESSON--During these bitter experiences David learned his own weakness
   and gained a spirit of humble prayer and perfect trust. Good men will
   have their fears at times, but what should that man fear who pleases a
   God who can crush all his adversaries? A bride received a present of
   15,000 dollars and was unhappy, fearing to be robbed before she placed
   it in the bank. Then she was perfectly at ease in her mind. So let us
   place our affairs in the hands of the Saviour and live a life of
   constant trust.

  Great Fact IV. David the King.

   2 Samuel

   For seven and one-half years David reigns over Judah in the south with
   Heron as the capital. When a new dynasty came to the throne it was the
   custom to put the family of the predecessor to death. David, however.
   had different religious principles. However, Saul's son, Ishbosheth,
   would not give up the throne without a struggle, so proclaimed himself
   king in the north and for seven and one-half years held the northern
   tribes against David. At last David captures Jerusalem, makes it the
   capital and removes the Ark to that place. Now thoroughly established
   on the throne, David earnestly desires to build a temple for the Ark
   and for the Lord to dwell in. Because he was a man of war God did not
   grant this desire, but makes Messianic covenant with David that through
   Christ he should have an everlasting kingdom. 2 Samuel 7:4-16. David
   had many foreign wars, committed the sin of adultery and murder, which
   he deeply repented. Psalm 51 and Psalm 32. He had many family troubles
   which culminated in the rebellion of his son Absalom, which was
   quelled. His sin in numbering the people and the land was punished with
   a three-day pestilence. He gathers great stores of material for the
   building of the temple and directs his son Solomon to build it. David
   dies at the age of seventy years.

   LESSON--David is one of the unique men of the world, ranking with
   Abraham, Moses and Paul. His religious experiences as told in the
   Psalms have endeared him to all. In character he was unselfish, in
   ability a great soldier and ruler, as a sacred poet and hymn writer he
   is unequalled in all times. He is also a more complete type of Christ
   than any other for he was shepherd and king, lion and lamb, a man of
   sorrows, then crowned with glory and honour. Let us, like David, have
   right conceptions of the almightiness and righteousness od God,
   confidence in the mercy Of God, and a desire to do the will of God.

   NAME--First and Second Kings is one story intended to be a continuation
   of the books of Samuel. They derive their name from the fact that they
   record the events of the reign of King Solomon and of the kings of
   Israel and Judah.

   AUTHOR--Jeremiah. Time of writing during the Exile 588-538 B. C.
   History recorded covers about 400 years from 977-577 B. C. (From the
   accession of Solomon to the Babylonian captivity and the destruction of
   the temple.)

   PURPOSE--To give the history of the glorious kingdom of Solomon, of the
   divided kingdom and the captivity. The southern kingdom (Judah) had 20
   kings in 390 years (977-587), and the northern kingdom (Israel) had 19
   kings in 256 years (977-721), which ended in the Assyrian captivity.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Solomon.
    2. Kings.
    3. Prophets.

  Great Fact I. Solomon's Reign.

   1 Kings 1; 1 Kings 2; 1 Kings 3; 1 Kings 4; 1 Kings 5; 1 Kings 6;
   1 Kings 7; 1 Kings 8; 1 Kings 9; 1 Kings 10.

   Solomon was the son of David and received his religious training from
   prophet Nathan. He succeeded his father at a favourable time and was
   approved by God and accepted by the people. His kingdom embraced 60,000
   square miles, 10 times more than his father inherited; this shows the
   achievements of David. Solomon's reign began with a blaze of glory but
   it ended in a division of the kingdom. His greatest work was the
   building of the Temple at Mt. Moriah, the eastern hill of Jerusalem.
   The temple was very magnificent, the materials being of the very best
   and overlaid with gold, silver and precious stones, so that a moderate
   estimate of its cost is $600,000,000.00. It was 90 feet long by 30 feet
   wide by 45 feet high.

   It contained the outer court of the Gentiles, and the inner court of
   the Jews, the court of the priests where daily sacrifices were offered
   up, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, the walls of which were
   covered with pure gold. In the Holy of Holies was the Ark with the
   mercy seat, overshadowed by the Cherubim and the supernatural Shekinah,
   light, the symbol of the presence of God. None but the High Priest, and
   he only on the Day of Atonement once a year with the blood of his
   offering, could enter the Holy of Holies. The temple was dedicated with
   great pomp and solemnity and Solomon's sermon and prayer were
   masterpieces.

   Solomon maintained a wise and strong administration or home affairs,
   erected many building and fortifications. Found leisure for writing the
   Proverbs and Song of Solomon and Ecclesiastes. Formed alliances with
   foreign nations. Became so famous that the Queen of Sheba visited him
   and declared upon seeing his glories that the half had not been told
   her. His decline set in because he married many heathen wives who
   introduced idolatry. Because of his backsliding God raised up enemies
   to vex Solomon. Ecclesiastes describes the bitterness of Solomon's
   heart at this time. Solomon reigned 40 years.

   LESSON--We must be wary of success. Not only as to how we get it, (but
   as to how we stand it. To succeed, we must build on a good foundation,
   must connect with right things and big things, not overlooking small
   things and then consecrate it all to God's glory.

  Great Fact II. Kings of the Divided Kingdom.

   1 Kings 11; 1 Kings 12; 1 Kings 13; 1 Kings 14; 1 Kings 15; 1 Kings 16;
   1 Kings 17;
   1 Kings 18; 1 Kings 19; 1 Kings 20; 1 Kings 22; 2 Kings 1; 2 Kings 2; 2
   Kings 3;
   2 Kings 4; 2 Kings 5; 2 Kings 6; 2 Kings 7; 2 Kings 8; 2 Kings 9; 2
   Kings 10; 2 Kings 11;
   2 Kings 12; 2 Kings 13; 2 Kings 14; 2 Kings 15; 2 Kings 16; 2 Kings 17;
   2 Kings 18;
   2 Kings 19; 2 Kings 20; 2 Kings 21; 2 Kings 22; 2 Kings 23; 2 Kings 24;
   2 Kings 25.

   During Solomon's reign the country groaned under an intolerable burden
   of taxes. Luxury, vice and idolatry broke down integrity, and the
   religious principles of the people. There had long been jealousy
   between the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah),
   so when Solomon's son Rehoboam, foolishly threatened to impose heavier
   burdens upon the people, there was instant revolt and Jeroboam was made
   king of the northern kingdom. He made Shechem his capital and set up
   idolatrous calf worship at Dan and Bethel. Israel had nine dynasties
   and 19 kings from Jeroboam to Hoshea, 977-721 B. C., 256 years. Then
   the people were carried into captivity by Shalmanesser never to return.
   He was the king of Assyria with his capital at Nineveh. Many of God's
   prophets warned Israel of impending captivity if they turned not from
   idolatry. The names of the prophets are Elijah, Jonah, Amos, Hosea and
   Micah.

   The southern kingdom (Judah) sought to conquer the northern kingdom but
   failed, and internal divisions weakened both kingdoms. In Judah there
   was only one dynasty, and 20 kings, from Rehoboam to Zedekiah, which
   reigned 390 years from 977-587 B. C. The prophets of Judah who kept
   alive the religion Of Jehovah were Joel, Isaiah, Nathan, Zephaniah,
   Habakkuk and Jeremiah. Judah fell to Nebuchadnezzar, who had his
   capital at Babylon, in 587 B. C., about 136 years after the northern
   kingdom had fallen. Jerusalem was destroyed and the temple was burned.
   The causes of the captivity are, the people had forsaken God and
   disregarded His word and ill-treated His prophets. So He permitted the
   nations to take away their freedom, in order that they might learn in
   adversity, that which they were too self-willed to learn in the time of
   privilege.

   LESSON--No nation or life can prosper and be happy if it forsakes God
   and disregards His word. It is not our genius and strength that makes
   our lives fortunate, but the supporting hand of the Almighty. Great is
   the gain of godliness. Said a wise Roman, "I would rather have the love
   of the Emperor, than his gifts." So acceptance with God is the greatest
   privilege, for in the light of His countenance is life.

  Great Fact III. Prophets.

   The prophets played an important part in the history of these times.
   For the most part they were flaming evangelists like Billy Sunday,
   seeking to stir up the consciences of the people, to abolish idolatry,
   and keep religion pure and undefiled. Also to encourage a spirit of
   earnest expectation of the coming of the Messiah.

   Perhaps the outstanding prophet was Elijah, who ministered in Israel
   during the reign of Ahab who had married a heathen princess, Jezebel.
   She did much to spread the worship on Baal. When Jehovah's school at
   the prophets had been broken up, and heathenism was at its zenith,
   Elijah suddenly appeared and prophesied a three-year drought. While in
   retirement he was fed by the ravens. He gave life to a widow's son at
   Zarephath, challenged Ahab again at Mt. Carmel, brought rain down from
   Heaven, trained Elisha as his successor and ascended into heaven in a
   chariot of fire.

   Elijah is the most romantic character of the Bible.

   LESSON--In the midst of the Dark Ages the prophets of God have always
   borne witness to the fact that God lives. When a woman whose husband
   had died was full of despair and weeping her little girl came up, and
   looking up into her tear-stained face, said, "Mother, is God dead?"
   Putting her arms about the child, the woman said, "Darling, you are His
   messenger to me." "The Lord reigneth." So, when the outlook is dreary,
   let us say again, "God is not dead; the Lord reigneth."

   NAME--The word "Chronicle" means a record. This book is so named
   because it is the time of the restoration of Judah from the brief
   record of events from Adam to the captivity.

   The two hooks of Chronicles are one in the Hebrew Bible. While they
   largely cover the same grounds as I and II Kings, Chronicles was of
   written especially for the Jews after the return from Babylon and
   follows the kingdom of Judah from the ecclesiastical viewpoint, and
   keeps in view the covenant promises.

   AUTHOR--Ezra. Time of writing, after the captivity in Babylon, 450-400
   B. C.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To show bow God preserved the tribe of Judah, and the line of David
       through which the Messiah was to come.
    2. To encourage the Jews to rebuild the temple.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Recognizing.
    2. Overthrowing.
    3. Establishing.
    4. Rending.
    5. Reforming.

  Great Fact I. Man Recognizing God.

   1 Chronicles 1; 1 Chronicles 2; 1 Chronicles 3; 1 Chronicles 4; 1
   Chronicles 5; 1 Chronicles 6.

   This record of men and their parentage is not a mere stringing together
   of names, but shows that throughout Israel's history God was ever
   behind the shadows keeping watch above His own. Ever and anon was
   selecting one and rejecting another, and the basis of selection was
   character built on faith and obedience. Disobedience forfeited the
   rights and privileges of the covenant. Noble birth or high family
   connections never helped. God always chose men who would carry out His
   will. Men were either made or ruined in the proportion that they
   recognized God in all the events of life.

   LESSON--There are many factors that lead to the success of one, and the
   absence of which leads to the failure of another. Among these are
   purity, honesty, industry, courage, shrewdness and politeness. But
   success will be short-lived and superficial unless it comes as "the
   heritage of them that loved the Lord."

  Great Fact II. God Overthrowing Saul.

   1 Chronicles 10.

   Ezra did not give us the history of Saul's reign, but only his
   overthrow, through which David comes to the throne.

   In a battle with the Philistines Saul is fatally defeated, and 10:13
   tells us the reason of it was "his transgressions against the Lord."

   No man's greatness can exempt him from the judgement of God.

   Saul had been a good son, and a brave and modest king in the early part
   of his reign. However, rebellion against God, stubbornness against
   God's will, and jealousy of David, wrecked his whole career. He who
   often conquered the Philistines could not conquer himself.

   LESSON--Likelihoods are not certainties. Our careers may have every
   prospect of being useful and happy. Whether or not the prospect will be
   realized, depends upon whether we choose our own time and our own way,
   or whether our wills are mastered by the Master. No man can resist God
   and prosper. The God-dominated heart and mind, pressing through the
   openings that God provides, is the only one who is really useful and
   happy.

  Great Fact III. God Establishing David and Solomon.

   1 Chronicles 11; 1 Chronicles 12; 1 Chronicles 13; 1 Chronicles 14; 1
   Chronicles 15;
   1 Chronicles 16; 1 Chronicles 17; 1 Chronicles 18; 1 Chronicles 19; 1
   Chronicles 20;
   1 Chronicles 21; 1 Chronicles 22; 1 Chronicles 23; 1 Chronicles 24; 1
   Chronicles 25;
   1 Chronicles 26; 1 Chronicles 27; 1 Chronicles 28; 1 Chronicles 29; 2
   Chronicles 1;
   2 Chronicles 1; 2 Chronicles 2; 2 Chronicles 3; 2 Chronicles 4; 2
   Chronicles 5;
   2 Chronicles 6; 2 Chronicles 7; 2 Chronicles 8; 2 Chronicles 9; 2
   Chronicles 10.

   Chronicles here gives us an account of the crowning of David at Hebron
   by united Israel. Tells us of David's mighty men who were doubtless
   made great by their leader's greatness. Tells us of the capture of
   Jerusalem and the bringing of the Ark to that place. It is sometimes
   called the city of David, because he made it the centre of Israel's
   life and glory.

   The account is next given of the making of Solomon king, the
   preparations of site, materials and labour for the temple, and the
   organization of the Levites, priests and singers for the service of the
   temple and kingdom.

   Chronicles deals particularly with the glorious periods of the
   theocracy, depicting its bright scenes and treating as briefly as
   possible those of the opposite character.

   For this reason the book contains more good cheer for the downcast than
   any other historical book in the Old Testament.

   LESSON--What God (lid for David and Solomon he will do for every good
   man. God is ever looking for wholly dedicated men whom He may exalt to
   places of highest usefulness. Take William Booth, founder of the
   Salvation Army. The fact that God established and owned the work of his
   hands was due to the utter abandonment of self and of selfish motives
   and to his one desire that God should have all that there was of him.

  Great Fact IV. Dividing the Kingdom.

   2 Chronicles 11; 2 Chronicles 12; 2 Chronicles 13; 2 Chronicles 14; 2
   Chronicles 15;
   2 Chronicles 16; 2 Chronicles 17; 2 Chronicles 18; 2 Chronicles 19; 2
   Chronicles 20;
   2 Chronicles 21; 2 Chronicles 22; 2 Chronicles 23; 2 Chronicles 24; 2
   Chronicles 25;
   2 Chronicles 26; 2 Chronicles 27; 2 Chronicles 28; 2 Chronicles 29; 2
   Chronicles 30;
   2 Chronicles 31; 2 Chronicles 32; 2 Chronicles 33; 2 Chronicles 34; 2
   Chronicles 35;
   2 Chronicles 36.

   The second division of Chronicles tells us how the ten northern tribes
   revolted and chose Jeroboam as their king, and how they rejected the
   worship of Jehovah.

   In the south, Judah kept the forms of the true religion, although there
   was a great lack of warm spiritual worship, and such a disregard of
   God's law and God's messengers that the people were taken captive to
   Babylon, and the temple was burned down.

   LESSON--A formal religion has no power in the life of a nation. A
   glorious temple will not take the place of the mighty Spirit of God.
   What made the Puritans so mighty was not their rules and regulations,
   but their sublime hold upon God.

  Great Fact V. Judah Sometimes Reforming.

   Under Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, Hezekiah, and Josiah, reformations and
   revivals were attempted. Fasts were proclaimed, idols removed, the law
   was read and the people were called to prayer.

   At one time religious enthusiasm ran so high that they threatened to
   put to death every person who did not seek the Lord, "and when they
   sought .him with all their hearts, He was found of them"--and gave them
   rest!

   The true path of blessing is found in learning, believing and obeying.

   The self-willed man is not happy! When a man proudly says, "I am my own
   master," the answer is, "Could you have worse?" Self-will is captivity
   and ruin, but loving obedience to the will of God with its self-control
   and self-denial is health and peace. Human goodness and human nobleness
   consist in self-forgetfulness the disregard of personal indulgence, and
   of personal advantages. At their best, David and Solomon were great
   men, and did a great work because they had a great God. Our conception
   of God controls everything.

   NAME--This book was named for its author, Ezra, the priest, teacher and
   reformer, who was from one of the best Jewish families, and who could
   trace his line back to Aaron. Ire was the first of the scribes, who, in
   our Lord's time, had degenerated so that they were odiously connected
   with the Pharisees. He was called a scribe because he was a teacher,
   and copier of the Law of Moses, and because he compiled the list of
   inspired books of the Old Testament. He also instituted synagogues for
   the first time for the local worship of the people.

   PURPOSE--To give an account of one of the most important events in
   Jewish history--the return of the people of Judah (the southern
   kingdom) from the Babylonian captivity. The northern ten tribes who
   were carried away captive to Assyria never returned. Some of the people
   doubtless conformed their lives and religion to the standards of the
   nations around them. A faithful few likely found their way back to the
   land of their fathers, but what became Of the ten tribes as a whole is
   a question of tremendous interest. There is a vast deal of evidence
   that the Anglo-Saxons are the direct descendants of the Ten Tribes, and
   this author fully discusses this question in his book, "The Chosen
   Nation."

   From this time, owing to the predominance of the tribe of Judah, the
   people are known as "the Jew."

   TIME OF WRITING--About 444 B. C. The first six chapters covers 23
   years, and mark the return of 50;000 under Zerubbabel B. C. 536.
   Between the sixth and seventh chapters there is an interval of 57 years
   during which the incidents of the book of Esther occur, then Ezra at
   the head of 6,000 exiles returned, B. C. 458. (The book covers 80 years
   in all.) Thirteen years later Nehemiah arrived at Jerusalem to build
   the walls of the city. 445 B. C.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Return.
    2. Rebuilding.
    3. Ministry.
    4. Separation.

  Great Fact I. The Return from Babylon.

   Ezra 1; Ezra 2.

   The Babylonian captivity did not bring the Jews to national repentance,
   and therefore did not lead to national restoration. The Babylonians had
   been conquered by the Medes and Persians. When Cyrus, their king, gave
   permission to the captives to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the
   temple, only 50,000 availed themselves of the privilege, and they never
   did regain their political independence, but were subject to Genesis
   tile rulers. God stirred up Cyrus to let his people go, and he gave
   into the hands of Zerubbabel 5,400 vessels of gold and silver which
   Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple when he captured Jerusalem.
   Besides this the people took with them a great store of goods. The
   genealogies had been carefully kept during the captivity. They now set
   forth on the long journey, which occupied about four months over the
   700 miles from Babylon to Jerusalem. From the first deportation of the
   Jews to the return was exactly 70 years, and there was a reason why it
   should be just 70. Israel had not kept every seventh year as a Sabbath
   year of rest for the land. Seventy Sabbatic years were desecrated, so
   it took seventy years of captivity to atone for the sin. Nor was the
   discipline in vain. The Jews were cured of idolatry; they have never
   since observed the religion of their heathen neighbours. They showed a
   new devotion towards the Sanctuary, and learned the value of the
   scriptures as never before. Thus God overruled the captivity for their
   good.

   LESSON--Trouble will sometimes teach us what nothing else will. Indeed,
   it is very useful and profitable to the real Christian. Jonah slept
   while on board the ship, but immediately he was cast into the sea, be
   repented and prayed. The prodigal had no thought of returning to his
   father's house until he got into trouble. A slave being given a bitter
   melon by his master immediately ate all of it. "How was it possible,"
   said the master, "for you to eat so bitter a fruit?" The slave replied,
   "I have received so many favours from you that it is no wonder that for
   once I should eat a bitter melon from your hand." The spirit of this
   answer was so (fine that his master immediately gave him his liberty.
   In such a spirit we should receive all our discipline and trials from
   the hand of God.

  Great Fact II. Rebuilding of the Temple.

   Ezra 3; Ezra 4; Ezra 5; Ezra 6.

   After the return to Jerusalem, the people began by setting up the altar
   of daily sacrifice. It was wise for them to begin with God. The altar
   of sacrifice (the burnt offering) was the centre of the Jewish
   religion, just as its antitype, the Cross, is the centre of
   Christianity. Care was taken to build the new altar on the foundations
   of the old one, doubtless to indicate the fact that the religion they
   brought back from captivity was the same as that they had taken away
   with them. The worship as prescribed in Leviticus is re-established,
   and the foundations of the temple are laid amid tender memories and
   bright hopes.

   The Samaritans, who were the descendants of an Assyrian colony planted
   in the province of Samaria, asked but were refused permission to join
   them in this work. When permission was refused they hindered the work
   by withholding supplies, and by lodging accusations with the king of
   Persia, under whom the Jews were subject. Work now had to be suspended
   for about fifteen years, during which time they had the altar and a
   tabernacle. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah stimulated the flagging
   zeal of the builders, and new permission being obtained, the work was
   resumed, and proceeded so rapidly that in 516 B. C. the temple was
   completed and dedicated with great joy.

   LESSON--Every important work has its hindrances, and no great results
   has been achieved without overcoming obstacles Hidden away, however,
   God usually has a Haggai who will press the reform at all costs.
   Whenever there is a great task to be accomplished there is always a
   clamour for delay. God needs men of action who will not stand shivering
   on the banks thinking of the cold and danger, but men who will jump in
   and scramble through. Life is too short for so much hesitation and
   calculation. "Act in the living present, heart within, and God o'er
   head!"

   Once the temple was finished the people began to live a new life. The
   house of God supplies the spiritual needs of man. The instinct of
   worship leads men to find peace within the walls of the sanctuary. The
   preaching of the everlasting gospel meets the human need of salvation.
   In the sanctuary we dream dreams and see visions of the Land beyond the
   setting sun. "There Heaven comes down, our waiting souls to bless." Let
   us set great store upon the place where we meet God.

  Great Fact III. Ezra's Ministry in Jerusalem.

   Ezra 7; Ezra 8.

   Eighty years have now elapsed since Zerubbabel and his company had
   returned to the holy city, Ezra with about 6,000 souls now set forth to
   Jerusalem. He assembled his company at the river Ahava, due east of
   Damascus, proclaimed a fast there and called on God for protection and
   blessing. Four months were occupied in crossing the desert. Besides
   carrying with them a multitude of gold and silver vessels, Ezra and his
   people had an order from the king authorizing the state treasurer at
   Jerusalem to pay him what was necessary for his sacred task.

   Upon his arrival at Jerusalem he put down idolatry, and arranged,
   edited and published the Old Testament, a work for which he will always
   be famous. He then read the scriptures publicly in the presence of the
   people and set up synagogues at all central places, for the reading of
   the Law, prayer and exhortation. The synagogue system tended greatly to
   reduce idolatry and promote devotion to the worship of God.

   LESSON--We also may be devout students of God's will as revealed in His
   Word "preparing our hearts to seek the law of the Lord to do it." We
   may open our hearts to receive heavenly influences, and gain by
   humility and prayer, "the hand of our God upon as for good." We may
   make known the will of God to others, teaching the truth of Jesus
   Christ. We may co-operate cheerfully with others, yielding our
   preferences to their, "being of the same mind in the Lord" with those
   who are our fellow labourers in Christian work.

   Philips Brooks gave as a definition of faith "Forsaking All I Take
   Him." It will be noticed that the initial letters spell faith. It would
   be a good thing if, like Ezra, we made as the motto of our lives,
   "Forsaking All I Take Him!"

  Great Fact IV. Separation.

   Ezra 9; Ezra 10.

   Ezra found that the Jews had paid no regard to the law which prohibited
   their marriage with idolaters, and that the very princes had been
   foremost in forming these unhallowed alliances. Ezra was deeply
   mortifiee and ashamed of this offense, and made confession unto God for
   the people. With contrite hearts, the people put away their idolatrous
   wives, purity was again restored and the Law honoured.

   LESSON--As Christians we are under obligations to renounce the world
   and all familiar intercourses with those whose character and conduct
   might prove a snare to beguile us into sin, 2 Corinthians 6:14-17. In
   the very names for believers we find something to suggest separation,
   "a. garden enclosed," Song 4:12; "a lily among thorns," Song 2:2; "a
   peculiar people," 1 Peter 2:9. A Christian is represented as a
   "soldier," 2 Timothy 2:4, who obviously cannot discharge his duty if he
   makes friends with his Master's enemies. Of course this separation does
   not mean the cold, haughty distance of the Pharisee. Civility and
   kindness must not be neglected, but we must keep away from those who
   would make us lose out personal piety or who would blunt out
   consciences.

   A converted Chinaman, when in America was deeply impressed with the
   little difference he saw between the style of living of many Christians
   and the men of the world. He said, "When Christians in my country come
   out from the world, they come clear out."

   NAME--This book was named for its author, Nehemiah, who held the
   honourable office of cup-bearer to the king of Persia. He was a worthy
   member of the old line of Hebrew believers, one whose character was
   cast in the same mould as that of Moses, Joshua and David of other
   days. He was sent to Judah as Persian governor of the province.

   TIMEOFWRITING--About 431 B. C. Events cover a period of eleven years,
   445 B. C. to 434 B. C.

   PURPOSE--To describe the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, the
   renewing of the covenant, and the temple and Sabbath reforms.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Rebuilding.
    2. Renewing.
    3. Reforming.

  Great Fact I Rebuilding the Walls.

   Nehemiah 1; Nehemiah 2; Nehemiah 3; Nehemiah 4; Nehemiah 5; Nehemiah 6.

   Thirteen years after Ezra arrived in Jerusalem, Nehemiah paid the city
   a visit. He viewed the ruined walls of the city and realized that no
   national life or security would be possible until they were protected
   from their enemies. With great faith and enterprise he succeeded in
   getting the Jews to rebuild the walls in the short period of 52 days.
   The Samaritans did everything in their power to frustrate the plans and
   work of the people, by ridicule, by craft and by conspiracy but without
   avail. Under the protection of God they continued the work, and
   Nehemiah's unselfishness was so great that all the time he acted as
   governor, he drew no salary from the state. After twelve years he
   returned to the court of the king of Persia, according to the promise
   he had previously made.

   LESSON--The success achieved in building the wall was due to the fact
   that the people "had a mind to work, to wait and to pray."

   The great tasks of the world are accompublished, not so much through
   genius as through labour. Many have a mind only to think and dream. In
   theory they can solve any problem, but more difficulties are removed by
   working than by thinking. "Labour and prayer overcome all things!"
   Enthusiastic work is the way that opens the treasuries of contentment
   and advancement, "Know what you can work at and work at it like a
   Hercules."

   The people had also a mind to wait. Just when they desired to build at
   full speed, they had to divide their forces and give attention to
   defence. Progress of the best kind is usually slow; we must be
   satisfied to advance in life as we walk, step by step. To know how to
   wait is a rare quality, but a most valuable one.

   The people also had a mind to pray. Nehemiah said, "I prayed the God of
   Heaven." Everybody prays when they get into trouble, but if we pray in
   time we would not get into trouble. Mr. Spurgeon was once asked the
   question, "How do you pray?" "I go to the Bible and find a promise
   applicable to my need, then I reverently plead that promise before the
   Lord, asking Him to keep it for Jesus' sake; and I believe God will,
   and He does."

  Great Fact II. Renewing the Covenant.

   Nehemiah 8; Nehemiah 9; Nehemiah 10; Nehemiah 11.

   While the events of the early chapters of Nehemiah were transpiring,
   Ezra had probably been recalled to Persia, hence Nehemiah found in
   Jerusalem, the oppression of the poor by the rich, desecration of the
   Sabbath, negligence with respect to the tithes and offerings, and many
   marriages of Jews with Gentiles or heathen women.

   As soon as Ezra returned he resumed the work of instructing the people
   of the Law. This stirred them up to repentance, and the Feast of
   Tabernacles (commemorating God's goodness to them during the forty
   years they were in the wilderness in the time of Moses), was solemnly
   observed. After the feast a great fast was kept, sackcloth was worn,
   and dust was sprinkled on the head. In the temple court, the vast
   assembly listened to the words of the Law and confessed their own sins.
   Then the Levites brought forward a written bond of covenant, pledging
   them to walk in God's law, and to make lasting provision for the priest
   and temple service.

   LESSON--Revivals of religion have always been associated with a revival
   of Bible-reading. This is infinitely precious to the devout believer,
   and infinitely powerful in changing lives.

   The covenant with God that the Jews entered into, helped them to keep
   true to Him. It is a good thing for the individual Christian to make a
   definite and sacred covenant with the God of his salvation. To vow to
   forsake all besetting sins, to practice every virtue, and seek to
   possess every fruit of the Spirit.

   Christmas Evans, after being sorely tried, was led to enter afresh into
   personal covenant with God, and such was the joy which followed, that
   he said of it "After forming the covenant, I felt great calmness and
   peace. I had the feeling of a poor man who had just come under the
   protection of a great king, and obtained a pension for life, the fear
   of poverty and want left me forever, I felt the safety which the little
   chicken feels under the wings of the hen." With Levi Persons, let us
   subscribe our hands to be forever the Lord's, to go anywhere, do
   anything, to endure any hardship, to live and die for the Lord.

  Great Fact III. Reforming Through Religion.

   Nehemiah 12; Nehemiah 13.

   After the walls of the city had been finished twelve years, a solemn
   dedication of the same took place. The long interval between is
   accounted for by the absent of Nehemiah from Jerusalem. The very act of
   dedication shows that the people relied not upon mere walls for safety,
   but upon divine protection.

   During Nehemiah's absence, the old evil practices had come in again,
   such as mixed marriages, trade on the Sabbath, irregularity in paying
   tithes, and the debasing of the temple. Part of the temple had been
   used as a dwelling house of a heathen! (By Tobiah, the Ammonite.)

   Nehemiah encouraged the Jews to lead a separate life again, the temple
   was cleansed, the Sabbath made sacred, and purity of worship restored.

   LESSON--Nehemiah would make no compromise with foes within the temple,
   or within the city, or without. He rebuked priests and nobles alike
   when they violated the teachings of the scriptures. He feared God so
   much that he feared man so little. He had faith to act with God and for
   God. He did not simply believe in right principles, and then do nothing
   for them. So when we believe that men will be forever lost unless saved
   by having faith in Christ, then we should be willing to put blood and
   sweat into the business of saving men. Are our lives bravely bearing
   witness to the truth that there is a hell to shun and a heaven to win?
   Are we soul-winners, or soul-losers? We need more aroused Nehemiahs.
   Only so will our homes and cities be changed by redemption grace.

   It is said that in a Scotch village on a stormy night all the peat
   fires went out and the next morning, the villages having no matches in
   those days, had to climb the hills where the fires still burned, and
   bring back some precious embers of fire. So let us climb the hills of
   God, and renew the fires of holy enthusiasm.

   NAME--This book is named for the Jewish orphan, Esther, who became a
   Persian queen, and through whose efforts the Jews were preserved from
   destruction. She was a woman of good judgement, magnificent
   self-control, and of the noblest self-sacrifice, ranking with the great
   women of the Bible.

   AUTHOR--Probably Ezra.

   TIMEOFWRITING--About 460 B. C.

   The events of the book cover 12 years, and took place between the sixth
   and seventh chapters of Ezra. We should remember in reading Esther that
   the Jews are in captivity in Persia, carried there by the Babylonians,
   as reported in 2 Kings 24-15.

   PURPOSE--To relate an event which involved the destruction or the
   preservation of the Jews, and to explain the origin of the Feast of
   Purim. The word "Purim" means "lots," because lots were cast to see
   which month the Jews should be destroyed.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Refusal.
    2. Crowning.
    3. Plotting.
    4. Feasting.

  Great Fact I. Refusal of Vashti.

   Esther 1.

   King Ahasuerus entertained at a great feast in the royal palace of
   Shushan all the banquet was on an enormous scale and ex-nobles and
   princes of his kingdom. This tended over 180 days. The men were feasted
   in the palace gardens, while the women were received by Queen Vashti in
   her private apartments. When much wine had been drunk, the king
   commanded that Vashti should attend the feast in order to show off her
   beauty to the semi-drunken revellers. Such a proceeding was a great
   breach of Persian etiquette, and an outrage upon one whom he, above all
   men, was bound to protect. Vashti therefore refused to obey. This made
   the king a laughing stock to all at the court, and on the advice of the
   princess, Vashti was deposed.

   LESSON--If Vashti had been proud of her beauty, and shameless, she
   would have gladly obeyed, but being womanly and modest, she would not
   make herself a gazing stock for wine-drinkers.

   Vashti may be taken as an example of devotion to just and pure ideals.
   She was true to her best self, and suffered for the time being, "but to
   thy own self be true and it follows as the night, the day, thou canst
   not then be false to any man." Modesty is the crown jewel of womanhood.
   None ever err from having too much of it, while thousands err from lack
   of it. Goldsmith said, "Modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not
   enriched with nobler virtues."

  Great Fact II. Crowning of Esther.

   Esther 2.

   Esther is now selected to succeed Vashti. She was a Jewish orphan who
   had been brought up by her uncle, Mordecai, and was beautiful in face
   and form. Upon seeing her, Ahasuerus instantly made her his queen,
   placed the royal crown upon her head, and celebrated the joyful event
   by a great feast, and a remission of taxes for a certain time. Thus the
   humble Jewish maiden became the queen of the empire. which comprised
   more than half of the known world.

   LESSON--We read that Esther pleased and obtained the favour of those
   who could advance her interests, so young people should cultivate
   qualities and manners that give them favour with men. There is a
   foolish idea abroad that when one becomes courteous he ceases to be
   independent. But the scripture urges us "Be courteous," 1 Peter 3:8,
   and we read that "the Lord Jesus grew in favour with God and men," Luke
   2:52. With one discourteous speech Rehoboam lost the ten tribes Of
   Israel, and could not win them back even with his blood. While
   Alexander the Great won the hearts of his footmen, by calling them his
   "fellow" footmen. The best Christian is the Christian who is most
   humble, and the truest lady or gentleman is that one who is the most
   courteous.

   Those who enjoy promotion should endeavour with watchfulness and prayer
   to use it for the good of their fellowmen and glory of God.

  Great Fact III. Plotting of Haman.

   Esther 3; Esther 4; Esther 5.

   Between chapters two and three there is an interval of some years.
   Haman has now become the chief minister to the king. In the East the
   men are so servile that a new favourite of the court receives royal
   honours. All bowed down before Haman except one man, Mordecai. But he,
   being a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, would not concede divine honours
   to a man! This enraged Haman, and he resolved, that if Mordecai,
   because he was a Jew, would not bow down to him, then there should be
   no more Jews--he would have them all put to death. To decide which day
   his enemies should be destroyed Haman casts lots, and the day that this
   indicated was the 13th of March, which was ten months distant. To
   obtain the king's consent to his plot, Haman asserted that they were
   disloyal subjects. He also offered to pay into the king's treasury a
   sum of about twelve million dollars. The result of his bribe was that
   King Ahasuerus signed a royal decree that on the day set, all the Jews
   within his kingdom, young and old, men and women, should be killed and
   their property confiscated. The Jews, clothed in sackcloth, fasted and
   prayed to God. Queen Esther inquired into Mordecai's grief, and he gave
   her a copy of the decree and added these significant words, "And who
   knoweth whether thou are come to the kingdom for such a time as this."

   Esther venturing before the king, is received with favour and invites
   the king and Haman to a banquet. That night the king, unable to sleep,
   had the records brought in and finds that Mordecai, who had once saved
   the king's life, had not been rewarded. Haman is called in and asked,
   what shall be done to the man the king delights to honour. Imagining
   that he himself was the man the king had in mind, he suggested the
   highest honour he could think of, which was carried out, not for
   himself, but for Mordecai. The king granted Esther's plea, Haman is
   hanged on the scaffold he had erected for Mordecai. The Jews were
   allowed to defend themselves and Mordecai was advanced to the place of
   honour next to the king.

   LESSON--It is astounding that, in order to revenge himself for one
   man's discourtesy Haman should seek the destruction of a whole race.
   However, he left out of his calculations the God of this race, and in
   this respect he resembles many of the persecutors of Christianity,
   Julian (331-363 A. D.) emperor of Rome, sought to stamp out
   Christianity and bring back paganism, but at his death he said, "Thou
   Galilean hast conquered!" We scarcely realize the constant plotting
   that goes on against Bible churches and Bible Christians, but Isaiah
   54:17; is still true. That religion is no religion that would persecute
   men's bodies in order to save their souls. A persecutor once said to a
   Christian woman, "You will soon taste the bitterness of death." But her
   answer was, "No, I NEVER shall, for death has lost its sting, and the
   grave gains no victory over those who are in Christ Jesus."

  Great Fact IV. Feasting.

   Esther 9.

   After the Jews had triumphed over their enemies, they had a
   Thanksgiving Day, and the festival became an annual holiday under the
   name of the Feast of Purim, or Feast of Lots, which falls on the 14th
   and 15th days of March, the 13th being observed as a fast in
   commemoration of Esther's fast before going in uninvited to the king.
   When the feast is celebrated, and the name of Haman is mentioned,
   shouts fill the synagogue, "May his name perish!" While the memory of
   Esther and Mordecai is cherished with gratitude and warmth. The Jews
   remember that, although they were in captivity, they were not forsaken
   by God, and because He spared them then, He will yet recall them to the
   Land of Promise.

   LESSON--When mercies have been received in common, they should be
   acknowledged in common. Praise is just and due tribute for all God's
   blessings; for what else do the best favours of God call for at our
   hands? Thinkful and thankful are closely allied in their Anglo-Saxon
   derivations. To be thankful is to be thoughtful or mindful of benefits
   received. A beautiful tradition says that when God created the world He
   asked the angels what they thought of the work of His hands, One of
   them replied that it was perfect that only one thing was lacking,
   namely, voices clear, mighty and harmonious ever filling the world day
   and night with sweet sounds of thanksgiving for the incomparable
   blessings of their Maker. So our thanksgiving should not be just an
   annual affair. It should be constant, the voice of love, which is ever
   living and fresh in our hearts. When David was wearied, in praising
   God, he called upon the sun, the moon, and the stars, to take up his
   Creator's praise!Psalm 148.

LESSON THEME:--JOB

   Job 23:1-10.
     * KEY WORD--"SUFFERING."
     * KEY VERSE--Job 5:17.
     * KEY PHRASE--"TRUSTING GOD IN SPITE OF TRIALS"

   Home Readings.

   Read this lesson and then the whole of Job. It is full of sublime
   teaching. For family altar, read:--
     * Sunday--Job and his accuser.--Job 1:1-12.
     * Monday--Job afflicted.--Job 1:13-28.
     * Tuesday--Bildad thinks Job a hypocrite.--Job 8:1-22.
     * Wednesday--Job answers his friends.--Job 12:1-25.
     * Thursday--Lord speaks to Job.--Job 38:1-18.
     * Friday--Job's self-judgement.--Job 42:1-9.
     * Saturday--Job vindicated and honoured.--Job 42:10-17.

   NAME--This book is named for the outstanding character of the book,
   Job, who lived in the land of Uz northeast of Palestine, probably just
   before the time of Abraham, about 2000 B. C. The book finds its place
   between the eleventh and twelfth chapters of Genesis, and is doubtless
   the oldest book of the Bible. Events cover one year of Job's life.

   AUTHOR--Probably Moses while in the desert of Midian, about 1520 B. C.
   It is possible that the teachings of the book were delivered to
   suffering Israel in Egypt, to comfort them under their burdens, and to
   encourage them in the hope, that as with Job, so God would also deliver
   and enrich them.

   PURPOSE--To show the disciplinary nature of suffering, and to inspire
   patience with the misfortunes of life.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Afflictions.
    2. Discussions.
    3. Addresses.
    4. Prosperity.

  Great Pact I. Afflictions.

   The story opens with Job a. prosperous and upright man. Satan's theory
   was that Job was good just because he was prosperous. God therefore
   gave Satan permission to afflict Job in order to test his
   righteousness. Job loses his children and property, for they were swept
   away in a single day. He next loses his health, for he is smitten with
   a form of leprosy, which quickly covers the body with boils. He suffers
   tortures and has little hope of recovery. He next loses his good name,
   for his best friends think he has committed some sin which has brought
   upon him his present troubles. Yet, in spite of these great trials, Job
   did not sin with his lips. He said, "What shall we receive good at the
   hand of God, and shall we receive evil? The Lord giveth and the Lord
   has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord!"

   LESSON--We see that Satan is not only a tempter' but an accuser of the
   saints, Revelation 12:10; and that he is permitted a certain power of
   sifting or testing among believers. However, they are sustained in
   their trials and kept in the faith by the prayers of Christ. Luke
   22:31-32.

   We learn,
    1. That if Satan can find his way into the very presence of God with
       his slanders, it is more than likely that he is very busy with his
       falsehoods in the churches of God on earth.
    2. That if so good a man as Job did not escape the accusations of
       Satan then it will not be surprising if ordinary Christians are
       accused.
    3. If God permitted Job and Peter to be cast into Satan's sieve, then
       we must expect also to be tested and tried.
    4. That if God set a limit to Satan's power, in his dealings with Job,
       how much more certain it is that he will limit Satan's authority'
       over us, who are less able to stand his attacks.
    5. That if God sustained Job when passing through the fiery ordeal and
       brought him out victor, how much more will He sustain us, and "give
       us twice as much as we had before?" Job 24:10.

  Great Fact II. Discussion as to Job's Uprightness.

   Job 4; Job 5; Job 6; Job 7; Job 8; Job 9; Job 10; Job 11; Job 12; Job
   13; Job 14; Job 15;
   Job 16; Job 17; Job 18; Job 19; Job 20; Job 21; Job 22; Job 23; Job 24;
   Job 25; Job 26; Job 27.

   Job's three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, arrive to comfort him,
   and there are three cycles of speeches, in which the problems of Jobs'
   afflictions, and the revelation of evil to the righteousness of God, is
   thoroughly discussed. Job's "comforters" argued that suffering is the
   penalty for sin, therefore his troubles were the result and the
   evidence of an ungodly life. Job, in spite of the reproaches of his
   friends, asserted his uprighteousness and urged, that even if the pure
   eye of God were to try him he would come forth as gold, 23-14. A young
   man, Elihu dissatisfied with the ideas of the older three, impetuously
   breaks in upon the discussion. His theory is that God-inflicted
   sufferings are chastisements that proceed from a loving purpose to
   purge out faults, to purify and to strengthen; and they should be borne
   in the right spirit, namely, in faith and humility.

   LESSON--
    1. Without doubt suffering does follow sin, as the cartwheel follows
       the horse. Man in his honest moments will admit that he brings a
       good many of life's sufferings upon himself through his own sins.
       However, this does not explain the cause of all sufferings for
       thousands of little children who have not sinned, do themselves
       suffer. There are other causes.
    2. Elihu suggests a second cause. God purifying and developing men and
       women through trials and sorrows so that they become more humble,
       more unselfish, more noble and useful than they ever were in the
       days of prosperity. This, however, does not explain all the causes
       of trial. There are thousands of cases of severe discipline, where
       it does not seem to be needed, and thousands of people seem to need
       it who do not get it.
    3. Henry Churchill King suggests a third reason for suffering. that
       without it true virtue would scarcely be possible. That if temporal
       happiness and temporal reward always followed good living or good
       deeds, then men would be good simply for what they could get out of
       it and unselfishness would die out. But because the same thing
       happens to the righteous as does to the wicked, therefore the
       righteous love God for what He is, and not for what they get out of
       Him.
    4. A fourth way of looking at sufferings, is to remember that God's
       ways are higher than our ways, Isaiah 55:9; that His infinity and
       majesty are so wonderful, that we may well leave the riddle for Him
       to explain, "when we shall know, even as we are known," 1
       Corinthians 13:12. Coulson suggests that if an ant were to crawl
       into the brain of a man it could not see things and understand
       things as man sees them and understands them. Neither ran a man,
       who is nothing but an ant as compared with God, put himself in the
       place of God and understand divine mysteries. When Payson, in the
       midst of great suffering, was asked if he saw any reason for the
       visitation, replied. "No but I am well satisfied as if I saw ten
       thousand; God's will Is the very perfection of all reasons."

  Great Fact III. Jehovah's Addresses

   Job 38; Job 39; Job 40; Job 41.

   In answer to Job's repeated demands that God would appear and solve the
   riddle of his life, the Lord answers Job out of a whirlwind. He does
   not refer to Job's individual problem, but in a series of questions
   asks him, as he thinks himself capable of fathoming all things, to
   expound the mysteries of the origin and preservation of the world, the
   wonders of the atmosphere, and the instincts of the animals; and as he
   thinks that God is not conducting the world right, invites him to seize
   the reigns of governments himself to clothe himself with divine thunder
   and quell the rebellious forces of evil in the universe. Job is humbled
   and abashed, and lays his hand upon his mouth, and repents his hasty
   words in dust and ashes.

   LESSON--It is an amazing act of presumption for a mere creature to find
   fault with God. The first sign of wisdom in a man is a realization of
   his own littleness and of God's greatness. Only the mind that planned
   the world can understand its government, and just as every phase of the
   material world is stamped with wisdom, so is also the moral and
   spiritual world. The more we understand of God's ways in redemption and
   providence, the more we admire them, and worship Him. Most men believe
   in the existence of God, but most men are seriously ignorant of His
   character. We should have a profound and an increasing faith in His
   wisdom and love. He is our divine ally, within us and about us, without
   Him we are helpless, with Him we are mighty!

  Great Fact IV. Job's Restored Prosperity.

   Job 42.

   Job's false comforters are censured, are urged to offer sacrifice, and
   are pardoned on the intercession of Job. He was granted twice his
   former possessions, though before he was the greatest of all the men on
   the earth, Job 1:3; 42:12. The Lord also gave him exactly the same
   number of children he had lost. He lived 140 years after his trial.

   LESSON--Although the honour of even a good man may be temporarily
   overshadowed by misfortune, yet God will cause the night of sorrow to
   be followed by the morning of joy. He will never forsake those who are
   faithful to Him. The story of Job also pictures to us that a peaceful
   old age in the bosom of a Christian family is one of the choicest
   blessings a saint can enjoy this side of heaven. Thus the beautiful and
   practical lessons of Job appear like so many flowers in a well-watered
   garden, proving a blessing to thousands, who have "heard of the
   patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord how that the Lord is
   full of pity, and merciful."

              Lesson No. 18--The Psalms have Conquered the World.

LESSON THEME:--Psalm

   Psalms 95:14.
     * KEYWORD--"WORSHIP."
     * KEYVERSE--Psalm 95:6.
     * KEYPHRASE--A BOOK OF HEART-FELT RELIGION.

   Home Readings.

   The Psalms cover at least seven subjects.

   Read a Psalm on each subject each day but as many more than one as you
   can read.
     * Sunday--Psalms of Law.-- Psalm 1; Psalm 11; Psalm 19.

       Psalm 36; Psalm 8.

   NAME--The Hebrew title of the book is "Book of Praises," so called
   because it is a manual for the nurture of the spiritual life in private
   as well as in public worship. "It is a marvellous record of human
   hearts pouring themselves out from age to age in communion with God."
   It has so much of Christ and His gospel as well as of God and His Law
   that it might well be called a Summary of both Testaments. Bishop Ryle
   says: "The Book of Psalms is full of Christ--Christ in humiliation,
   Christ suffering, Christ dying, Christ rising again, Christ coming the
   second time, Christ reigning over all. Both advents are here the advent
   in suffering to bear the cross, the advent in power to wear the crown.
   Both kingdoms are here--the kingdom or grace, during which the elect
   are gathered; the kingdom of glory, when every tongue shall confess
   that Jesus is Lord. Let us always read the Psalms with a peculiar
   reverence, saying to ourselves, "A greater than David is here."

   WRITERS--There are 150 Psalms.
     * 50 of them are anonymous,

     * 73 were written by David,
     * 122 by Asaph,
     * 10 by the sons of Korah,
     * 2 by Solomon,
     * 1 by Moses,
     * 1 by Ethan and
     * 1 by Heman.

   TIMEOFWRITING--From the time of Moses, who wrote the 90th Psalm about
   520 B. C., to the time of Malachi, about 420 B. C., covering 1100 years
   of Israel's history. They were collected and arranged by Ezra. There
   are about 70 references to the Psalms in the New Testament.

   ARRANGEMENT--In the Hebrew text the Psalms are arranged into five
   distinct books, reminding one that the Pentateuch is divided in like
   manner, Book I, Psalm. 1-41; Book II, Psalm. 42-72; Book III, Psalm.
   73-89 Book IV, Psalm. 90-106; Book V. Psalm. 107-150. Each of the five
   divisions ends with the same doxology, "Amen, Amen, Hallelujah!"

   PURPOSE--To provide a book of devotion for the Lord's People.

Following Dr. A. T. Pierson we will group the Psalms in seven divisions:--

    1. Psalms of Law.
    2. Of Creation.
    3. Of Judgement.
    4. of Christ.
    5. Of Life.
    6. Of Heart. VII. Of God.

  Great Fact I. Psalms of the Law or of the Scriptures,

   Psalm 1; Psalm 11; Psalm 119.

   These Psalms extol and praise God's word, which is the great expression
   of God's mind and will. The excellency of it is sung in a thousand
   tongues and it is prized "above gold, yea, the finest gold," it is
   "sweeter than honey and the hone-comb."

   LESSON--If the devout Israelites saw such wonders in the Old Testament,
   what ought we to see who haveth both Old and New? How we ought to love
   and treasure the one Divine Book that blesses little children, Matthew
   19:14. That makes young men strong, 1 John 2:14. That makes young women
   pure and chaste, 1 Timothy 5:2. That protects the widow, Exodus
   22:22-23. That honours the grey hair of the aged, Leviticus 19:32. That
   offers eternal life freely to all who will accept it by faith in the
   Lord Jesus Christ. John 3:36. Let us read every day and memorize much
   of the "Best Book of All!"

  Great Fact II. Psalms of Creation.

   Psalm 19; Psalm 29; Psalm 104.

   These Psalms are the poets' version of Genesis. To them the whole earth
   is a Bible, and the voice of nature is the voice of God. The Psalmist
   gives God the glory for the splendour of the skies, the creation of
   land and sea, and all that in them is; and the provision He has made
   for the preservation of all His Creatures.

   LESSON--This fair earth is a mighty parable, and full of the Shekinah
   glory. There is not a leaf, nor flower, nor dewdrop, but be as God's
   image and reveal His heart. We should develop the faculty of seeing God
   hi all the things of nature Tennyson charmingly puts it:

   "The sun, the moon, the stars, the seas, the hills and plains
   Are not these, O Soul, a vision of Him who reigns?"

   The Psalmist said, "Lord, how manifold are thy works!" He studied them
   all in a religious spirit. Then let us not ungratefully pass them over
   without consideration, but beholding the wonders of nature, and
   realizing their sacredness, let us then with gratitude look up and
   exclaim, "The Maker of all these wonders is my Friend!"

  Great Fact III. Psalm of Judgement.

   Fifteen Like Psalm 35; Psalm 69; Psalm 109.

   These Psalms contain prayers for defeat and overthrow of the wicked,
   and are called "Imprecatory Psalms," or Psalms of Judgement upon
   enemies.

   At first thought the curses pronounced upon the wicked are startling
   and painful, but we must remember that the enemies cursed, are not
   personal enemies, but the enemies of God's cause; those who break every
   moral law and defy God. The Psalmist identifies himself with Jehovah,
   and prays with His glory in view. Psalm 139; Psalm 21; Psalm 22.

   LESSON--No one should pronounce curses on his personal enemies. Read
   what our Lord says in Matt. 5:44. When, however, the Lord's honour is
   at stake and His cause in peril, we are justified in denouncing evil
   and evil-doers. Like David, we must draw our swords and with burning
   zeal fight bootlegging, graft, gambling, Sabbath desecration, and all
   the vicious evils that a: e treading under foot our blood-bought
   religious liberties and our holy faith.

  Great Fact IV. Psalms of Christ (Sixteen)

   Like Psalm 2; Psalm 16; Psalm 22; Psalm 24.

   They are also called Messianic because they are full of descriptions of
   the coming Christ or Messiah. They picture Him as coming to suffer as
   in Psalm 22; and as coming to reign as in Psalm 24. They picture Him as
   our eternal Priest, Psalm 110:4. They picture Him as King fulfilling
   the Davidic covenant, Psalm 89:3-4.

   LESSON--It is very important that we associate the Psalms with Christ.
   Most of their truths can apply literally only to Him. The scarlet
   thread of His redeeming work, and the golden thread of His coronation
   are seen all through these songs of the sweet singers of Israel.
   "Christ shall reign where'er the sun, doth its successive journey's
   run, His kingdom stretch from shore to shore. till moons shall wax and
   wane no more." Then let us prepare to sit with Him on His throne,
   rather than to be His foot stool.

  Great Fact V. Psalms of Life (Eighteen)

   Like 3; Psalm 18; Psalm 44; Psalm 60; Psalm 68.

   These may be divided into two sections, Psalms of personal life and
   those affecting national life. In the former we have prayers for
   deliverance from pressing danger and trouble, interspersed with
   confidence and faith in God's goodness, and exhortations to the saints
   of God to be strong and trust in Him. In the national Psalms, God's
   care of the nation is praised, His favour is sought upon all their
   affairs, and His help in battles implored.

   LESSON--What is God to us; what is Christ to us, personally? Living
   water will not flow into a vessel turned upside down. The Psalms are
   full of mercy and truth, hope and comfort, for those who come to them
   as empty vessels to be filled. "Oh, fill me with thy fullness, Lord,
   until my very heart o'erflow!"

  Great Fact VI. Psalms of the Heart (78)

   Like Psalm 6; Psalm 38; Psalm 42; Psalm 23; Psalm 10; Psalm 21; Psalm
   4.

   Among these we have Psalms of penitence, sorrow, darkness, faith,
   prayer, worship and vision.

   LESSON--The plans, work and enjoyments of life are too often without
   God. Many look up and pray only when they are in the school of trouble
   and have the deepest heart experiences. Mrs. Browning says, "Eyes that
   the preacher could not school, by wayside graves are raised. And lips
   say, God be merciful!' that ne'er said God be praised!' "

   The spirit and habit of prayer will keep us out of trouble, and make
   our days peaceful and prosperous.

  Great Fact VII. Psalms of God (38).

   Like Psalm 90; Psalm 139; Psalm 46; Psalm 5; Psalm 18; Psalm 36; Psalm
   8.

   These Psalms praise the sublime attributes of Almighty God. They speak
   of His glorious power, of His universal presence in every place at the
   same time, of the wonderful facts that He knows all things and sees all
   things. "That He is our shield and Defender, the Ancient of days,
   pavilion in splendour and girded with praise!"

   LESSON--What must be the wisdom of Him from whom all beings derive
   their wisdom; what must be the goodness of Him from Whom all beings
   derive their goodness; therefore let us worship God. In youth and in
   age, in sorrow or in joy, in distress and in prosperity, let us worship
   God. "Let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our
   Maker, for He is our God and we are the people of His pasture." Ps.
   95:6. A woman who had a child who was not normal, said she would be
   satisfied if he would just recognize her. Are we normal if we fail to
   recognize our Maker, Redeemer and Friend?

   Lesson No. 19--Take Your Bible to Bible Class for Reading the Scriptures.

LESSON THEME:--PROVERB

   Proverbs 9:1-10.
     * KEY WORD--"WISDOM."
     * KEY VERSE--Proverbs 9:10.
     * KEY PHRASE--"HEAVENLY WISDOM FOR THE EARTHLY LIFE."

   Home Readings.

   Read the whole of Proverbs. Matthew Arnold says it is "a delicious
   book." For the family altar read:--
     * Sunday--Foundation Maxims,--Proverbs 1:1-19.
     * Monday--Christian Wisdom described,--Proverbs 3:1-24.
     * Tuesday--Wisdom the best way,--Proverbs 4:1-18.
     * Wednesday--Against various evils,--Proverbs 6:1-20.
     * Thursday--Christ is wisdom in this chapter,--Proverbs 8:1-17.
     * Friday--Warnings and instructions,--Proverbs 28:1-13.
     * Saturday--A virtuous woman,--Proverbs 31:10-31.

   NAME The name is taken from the opening words. "The proverbs of
   Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel." A proverb is a short and
   pithy saying that forcibly expresses some practical truth. God's ways
   in wisdom are seen in the Book of proverbs.

   WRITERS--Solomon, Hezekiah, Agur and Lemuel. Collection was completed
   under Hezekiah, about 800 B. C.

   PURPOSE--To provide a hand-book of wisdom, which would apply to the
   earthly conditions of the people of God. We have had divine laws, and
   divine histories, and divine Psalms, now we have divine wisdom. This
   book contains in small compass a complete body of divine ethics,
   politics and economics, exposing every vice, recommending every virtue,
   and suggesting rules to govern self in every relationship of life. Many
   a young man has laid the foundation of his character upon this book. It
   is a'living book. Its teachings apply to all men and all conditions
   today.

GREAT FACTS:--

   The Duties of Man to:--
    1. God.
    2. Ourselves.
    3. Neighbours.
    4. Parents and Children.
    5. Civil Life.

  Great Fact I. The Duties of Man to God.

   The first of all duties, the foundation of all morality and religion,
   is the fear of God. Proverbs 1:7. This must be followed by perfect
   trust in Him and distrust in self, Proverbs 3:5. Religious worship and
   service must not be neglected. "It disgraces a man to deny his promise
   and after his vow to back out." Proverbs 20:25 R. V. but God looks
   chiefly at the heart, Proverbs 17:3. It is this which makes men
   acceptable or abominable in His sight, Proverbs 11:20. If we sin we
   must confess our guilt, Proverbs 28:13 and meekly submit to His
   chastisement, Proverbs 3:11.

   LESSON--Summed up, our duties to God are: trust in Him, reverence and
   service for Him, our hearts right before Him, confession and submission
   to Him. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. There should
   be, however, not only the selfish fear that He might hurt us, but the
   fear of love, fearing lest we hurt Him. We shall not begin to be wise
   until our lives are in right relation with Christ, the Fount of all
   wisdom.

   If we trust Christ wholly, and acknowledge Him constantly, Proverbs
   3:6, we have every assurance that He will guide our feet along the
   paths of life, lead us into all truth, help our souls up the heights of
   holiness, and direct our steps into the gates of the Heavenly City.

  Great Fact II. Duties to Ourselves.

   The chief lesson urged is the utter necessity of avoiding fleshly lusts
   and evil companionship, Proverbs 1:10. Among deadly sins to be avoided
   special mention is made of pride, which is hateful to God and is the
   enemy of wisdom, Proverbs 16:18. Greed and covetousness lead to fraud
   and wrong, Proverbs 28:30. and produce only temporary profit, Proverbs
   14:30. Envy is as rottenness in the bones, Proverbs 14:30. Luxury and
   intemperance which are induced by imitating the non-Christian rich. are
   strongly condemned and shown to insure most fatal results Proverbs
   23:21. Anger leads to folly, causes quarrels and makes a man hateful,
   Proverbs 14:17. Idleness ruins equally a man's character and
   prosperity, Proverbs 13:4. Much is said about the necessity of guarding
   the tongue, in the power of which are life and death, Proverbs 12:22
   and Proverbs 18:21. We should avoid self-praise, Proverbs 27:2.

   LESSON--Our conduct has a good or evil effect upon ourselves, and is
   exposed to Divine judgement. The author of this book of Wisdom
   therefore pleads with us to avoid evil companions, pride, greed, envy,
   intemperance, anger, idleness and sins of the tongue. It is impossible
   for us to do this, however, except we have Christ the Wisdom of God
   within us. The old Spartan, who tried to make a corpse stand upright,
   hut found that it would fall, said, "Ah, it needs something inside!"
   Yes. it needed life! If we have that life. then our souls will be drawn
   to all that is worthiest and noblest. His presence will guard us from
   evil, enrich us with every true blessing, and gladden us with lasting
   joy.

  Great Fact III. Duties to Our Neighbours.

   We should sympathize with the afflicted, and try to cheer them,
   Proverbs 12:25. Should help the poor in their need, because they are
   brethren, and children of the same Father, Proverbs 14:31. A neighbour
   should be judged honestly and truthfully, Proverbs 17:15. We should
   live with him in peace, Proverbs 3:29; should not slander him, Proverbs
   11:12-13; should encourage sincere friendship, Proverbs 18:24; should
   be strictly honest in all transactions with him, Proverbs 11:1.

   LESSON--Kindness is due our neighbours and fellowmen, therefore we
   should he sympathetic, helpful, peaceable, friendly and honest. Extreme
   unsociability is a form of sin. Themistocles, when he had a farm for
   sale, advertised the fact that he had a good neighbour, His point was
   that good neighbours are worth having. Thomas Pane, the infidel, once
   observed to a preacher, "What a pity it is that man has not a perfect
   rule for the government of his life." The preacher replied, "There is
   such a rule. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   thy neighbour as thyself!" The infidel was put to confusion, realizing
   that our religion covers all the duties of life. Two neighbours, one a
   Christian and the other not, who lived on the opposite side of the same
   street, were dying at the same time. One of them said to the other, "I
   feel that I am dying, and my neighbour over the way, I hear is dying
   too. They say he is going to heaven; I know I am going to hell He must
   have known that I was perishing, but he never warned me of my danger or
   told me of the way of salvation. We were together every day, and we
   talked of the weather and markets and politics and a thousand other
   things, but he never spoke to me about my soul. His silence I regarded
   as the sanction of my sin. He may be going to heaven, but he will be
   followed to heaven with the curses of my lost soul!" To those who need
   our help, especially spiritual help, God help us to be real neighbours!

  Great Fact IV. Duties of Parents and Children.

   Godly parents are a blessing to children, Proverbs 20:7, and should
   instruct them in holiness from the earliest years, Proverbs 4:1. Should
   train them in the right way, Proverbs 22:6, and correct them when they
   do wrong, Proverbs 13:13. Children on their part, should attend to the
   instructions of parents, and gladden their hearts by prompt obedience
   and a virtuous life, Proverbs 1:8. Let the mother of the family realize
   her high position, and be the crown of her husband, Proverbs 12:4; and
   build up her house, Proverbs 14:1. If she needs an example let her
   emulate the virtuous woman, Proverbs 31:10-31. Be it far from her to
   imitate the contentious wife, whose peevish ill temper is like the
   continuous dropping of water through a leaky roof, and renders family
   life insupportable, Proverbs 19:13. Servants should be wisely treated
   in order that they should not presume too much, Proverbs 29:21.

   LESSON--The Bible hallows and sanctifies all the relationships of life
   and we should read it frequently and thoughtfully if we would measure
   up to the standards God requires. Parents should remember that what
   they are, and what they do will determine the character and happiness
   of their children. A. child born in China inherits the sinfulness and
   ungodliness of Chinese parents. Children brought up among the Arabs,
   Hottentots or Indians inherit all the failings and vices of their
   various countries. Ham's children departed from the good ways of Noah,
   so all Africa became debased. Shem's children were true to the living
   God, so through them has come all the good things of our religion. What
   is true as to nations, is true as to families. Parents ought to pray
   that great grace may be given to them.

   Children should always obey their parents (unless contrary to the
   right), while they are in the home, but honour them forever.

  Great Fact V. Duties in Civil Life.

   It is the duty of men to render obedience to the powers that be;
   punishment speedily overtakes the rebellious, Proverbs 16:14. God is
   the maker of the rich and poor in the land, Proverbs 22:2, therefore
   the rich ought to help the poor, Proverbs 14:21, and not treat them
   roughly, Proverbs 18:23. All commercial transactions should be
   conducted with, the strictest honesty, and the withholding of what is
   due is especially denounced, Proverbs 11:26. It is a foolish thing to
   stand security for another's debt; you are sure to smart for it, and
   then you can blame only yourself, Proverbs 6:1-2.

   LESSON--It is the duty of the Christian to support all legislation
   against child labour, vice, crime, monopolies and everything that is
   opposed to a better social order. We are citizens of two worlds, and
   our aim should not be only to take people to Heaven, but to bring
   Heaven down to the people. Jesus Christ taught that the only way to
   solve bad conditions is to put into men good motives; that men are not
   tree to do what they like, but what they ought! That the first stone of
   the Golden Age was laid at Calvary. The men of our cities should set up
   their altars, and their prayers, their votes and their efforts against
   graft and lax enforcement of law, and so co-operate with God "in making
   all things new!"

   NAME--The name Ecclesiastes means preacher, so-called because this book
   contains the meditations and sermons of the wise man, Solomon; so that
   another name would be "The Book of the Preacher."

   WRITER--Solomon.

   TIMEOFWRITING--979 B. C.

   SPECIALNOTE--In reading this book do not form spiritual judgements on
   the isolated verses. Inspiration set down accurately what the preacher
   said, just the same as the words of Satan are set down, Genesis 3:4;
   Job 2:4. But just as we recognize that the words of Satan do not
   express the mind of God, so we should also recognize that the
   reasonings of a mere natural man, who leaves God out of account, will
   very often not express the mind of God. Solomon had been holy and
   happy, but in his old age became backslidden and cynical. In lamenting
   his own folly and mistakes, he utters many pessimistic sayings that
   show how he felt about life, but not what God teaches about life.
   However, he was wise enough to see the emptiness of pleasure, riches,
   folly and impiety.

   PURPOSE--To show that true happiness apart from God is impossible.

  GREAT FACTS:--

   The Emptiness of:--
    1. Pleasure.
    2. Riches.
    3. Folly.
    4. Impiety.

  Great Fact I. The Emptiness of Pleasure.

   Ecclesiastes 1; Ecclesiastes 3; Ecclesiastes 3.

   The preacher first lays down the proposition that all things are
   unreal, and the results of human effort are deceitful, and that life is
   one unending round. As al scholar and thinker he finds no satisfaction,
   so he turns to mirth and pleasure. He engaged in banqueting and
   revelry, fleshly indulgence and worldly excitements; but the feverish
   excitement soon passed away and left him in deeper gloom, so he
   exclaims in Ecclesiastes 1:2, "All is vanity."

   LESSON--Disappointed men are found, not only on poor farms and in the
   ranks of the unemployed, but also in the ranks of high society and in
   the mansions of the fortunate in life. There is the man who is
   disappointed because he does not get, and there is the man who is
   disappointed because he DOES get, and the latter is by far worse of the
   two. The man who is disappointed because he does NOT get may have still
   the fascination of his hopes before him. But the man who has got what
   he desires and is then disappointed, has pricked the bubble, and knows
   the meaning of emptiness and vexation of spirit. The last was the
   disappointment of Solomon. The selfish man always a disappointed man.
   This book reveals utter selfishness. It is all I, I, I,--I made, I got,
   I did, I had, I sought, and that is the end of it all. These is a great
   art in choosing beneficial pleasures. No Christian in his best moments
   would sanction those pleasures that lead to immorality or gambling. On
   the other hand, after all the questionable things are left out there
   are so many pure and elevating enjoyments, left, that there is no real
   self-denial, but rather self-enrichment. Mr. Beecher said, "Upon this
   broad earth, purified with flowers, scented with odours, brilliant in
   colours, vocal with echoing and re-echoing melody, I take my stand
   against all demoralizing pleasure." God made all men to be happy! * * *
   He has set before us a thousand right and ennobling avenues of
   enjoyment--let us not sacrifice true and permanent happiness for
   questionable pleasures

  Great Fact II. The Emptiness of Riches.

   Ecclesiastes 4; Ecclesiastes 5; Ecclesiastes 6.

   Solomon has shown the emptiness of pleasure, honour, and power. Many
   will agree with him on this but at the same time will think that money
   is the supreme good in life. Solomon combats this error in these
   chapters. and shows that neither the gathering of great riches, nor in
   the spending of them, is there real happiness, Ecclesiastes 5:10. It is
   true that honest labour leads to prosperity, and this is desirable.
   More often it is the ungodly who increase in riches through dishonesty,
   speculation, or oppression. Both their wealth and a furious lust of
   wealth increase, and when they possess the most they seek for more.
   Their anxieties increase, they do not get refreshing sleep, they get in
   love with the world, become proud, are much tempted, they draw their
   hearts away from God and from duty, and make it very difficult for
   themselves to enter the kingdom of Heaven, Matthew 19:23.

   LESSON--It is lawful to gather wealth, if we can do so without
   violating the laws of God and man, and if we consecrate it to the
   service of God and man. Two questions will be asked rich men at the
   Judgement: How did you make your money, and how did you spend it? If
   riches increase, set not your heart upon them, Psalm 62:10. On the
   other hand remember that it is easier to be contented without riches
   than with them. It is so natural to make gold our god. to trust in it,
   and to depend upon it for happiness. The Bible depreciates the value of
   money because the best things, like salvation, blessedness and peace
   cannot be bought with it. It is not along golden roads that God's
   children pass to bliss. Therefore, happy are those who have learned to
   he contented with little, whose wants are few and moderate, who, having
   the necessaries of life, are thankful and hopeful. "I never complained
   of my lot," said a Persian poet, "but once--when my feet were sore, and
   I had no money to buy shoes; but I met a man without a foot, and became
   contented with my lot when I saw him!"

  Great Fact III. The Emptiness of Folly.

   Ecclesiastes 7; Ecclesiastes 8; Ecclesiastes 9; Ecclesiastes 10;
   Ecclesiastes 11.

   The thought of these chapters is "Be not foolish," Ecclesiastes 7-17.
   Seek a good name and cherish it above all earthly distinctions,
   cultivate meekness, be diligent, make the best of the present instead
   of dreaming about the past, or the future. Serve God with intelligent
   reason and prudence instead of rushing to extremes in anything. Perish
   in righteousness, rather than prosper in wickedness. Wisdom is the
   highest good. "Wisdom giveth life to those who have it!" Ecclesiastes
   7:12.

   LESSON--The root of folly is represented as in the heart, Proverbs
   12:23. There is more folly in the heart of man than in the head.
   Foolishness stands first in the catalogue of evils, Romans 3:3.
   Examples of folly are, the foolish builders, Matthew 7:26; the foolish
   virgins, Matthew 25:1-13; the rich fool, Luke 12:16. On the other hand,
   the wisdom that is from above will preserve the soul's life, by
   imparting to it the gift of God, which is eternal life, it will
   preserve the mind's life, by flooding it with truth; it will preserve
   the body's life by giving it length of days and a glorious resurrection
   at the last day!

  Great Fact IV. The Emptiness of Impiety.

   Ecclesiastes 12.

   This chapter is a call to young people to "Remember now thy Creator in
   the days of thy youth," Ecclesiastes 12:1. Not to flatter themselves
   with vain expectations, but to guard against the spiritual disease of
   youth. Rutherford said, "A young man le often a dressed lodging for the
   devil to dwell in. Satan has a friend at court in the heart of youth,
   and their pride, luxury, lust and forgetfulness of God are his hired
   agents. Therefore, what a sweet couple, what a glorious couple are
   youth and grace, Christ and a young man!" The period of youth has the
   responsibility of shaping all one's after life, and if we do not
   remember our Creator in early days we shall not be able, nor shall we
   want to do so, in the later days of life. The philosophy of
   Ecclesiastes is summed up in these words:--"Reverence God and keep His
   commandments for this is the whole duty of man!"Ecclesiastes 12:13.

   LESSON--There are many reasons why we should become devout Christians
   in early days.
    1. In youth the foundations of life are laid. Some workmen in building
       a tower laid one brick a little out of line. The work went on
       without it being noticed, but as each course of bricks was kept in
       line with those already laid-the tower was not put up exactly
       straight, and the higher they built, the more insecure it became.
       One day there was a tremendous crash. The building had fallen,
       burying the men in the ruins. Lives were sacrificed, time lost,
       materials were wasted, all because one brick was laid wrong at the
       start. Think of that ruin that comes of one bad habit, or one brick
       laid wrong, while you are building a character for life and
       eternity. Keep the foundation straight.
    2. Because life is always uncertain, there are graves in the
       churchyard just your length. God will not spare you on account of
       your youth, if you die without an interest in Christ.
    3. Because if you seek Christ early and find Him, your life will be
       more eminently useful to God, and more serviceable to men.
       Augustine repented, and so have many others, that they began the
       Christian life so late, and knew God no sooner.
    4. Because your whole life will be happier if the morning of it is
       dedicated to the Lord. The first fruits sanctify the whole harvest.
       This will have a sweet influence upon all your days, whatever
       changes may come. Let every young person say today.

   Now that my journey's just begun,
   My course so little trod,
   I'll stay before I further run,
   And give myself to God!

      Lesson No. 21--The Churches' Biggest Business is to Teach the Bible.

LESSON THEME:--SONG OF SOLOMON

   Song 2:1-4.
     * KEY WORD--"LOVE."
     * KEY VERSE--Song 2:4.
     * KEY PHRASE--"GOD'S LOVE FOR ISRAEL AND THE CHURCH."

   Home Readings.

   Do not fail to read through the whole Bible in connection with this
   course. This week read the Song of Solomon. The following selections
   are for the family altar:--
     * Sunday--In joyful Communion,--Song 1:1-7.
     * Monday--The Rose of Sharon,--Song 2:1-7.
     * Tuesday--The visit of the beloved,--Song 2:8-17
     * Wednesday-The Absence of the Beloved,--Song 3:1-5.
     * Thursday--The Seeking Bride,--Song 5:6-8.
     * Friday--The bridegroom praised,--Song 5:10-16
     * Saturday--In praise of the bride,--Song 6:4-9.

   In the East the physical charms of lovers are described minutely
   without any thought of vulgarity. In this book, one is on holy ground;
   pray for spiritual understanding!

   Remember that it is made up of conversations between the bridegroom and
   the bride, and between the bride and her attendants. As you read keep
   the various speakers distinct in your mind.

   NAME--This book is called the Song of Solomon because Solomon is the
   author and hero of it.

   TIME OF WRITING--About 1000 B. C.

   PURPOSE--To show in the changeless devotion of the bridegroom and the
   bride, the love of Jehovah for Israel, and of Christ for the church.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Rapture.
    2. Festival.
    3. Separation.
    4. Reunion.

  Great Fact I. The Bride's Rapture.

   Song 1-3:5.

   The bride is a beautiful Shulamite maiden. So called because she was
   the descendant of Shulam, who was a son of Dan. Shulamith, the bride,
   is awaiting the arrival of her lover, and, surrounded by a chorus of
   ladies, pours out her rapture and longing, which is responded to by her
   admiring companions, Song 1:1-8. The royal lover appears, and the
   rapturous joy of mutual delight is poured out in the banqueting house,
   Song 1:9-2:7, closing with a song of serene contentment, addressed by
   the bride to her companion, Song 2:7. In the rapture of the new-found
   love, the bride tells how her loved one wooed her, and how their love
   was mingled with the loveliness of opening spring and summer. How her
   heart longed for him until he was found, and when found, she was not
   willing to let him go, Song 3:5.

   LESSON--The rapture of the bride for the bridegroom reminds us of the
   loving intercourse between Israel and Jehovah, and between the church
   and the heavenly Bridegroom. Some of the noblest religious souls have
   expressed their love in the fervent words of this Song of Songs,

   In this parable of love we have a king seeking and wooing a bride in
   her humble home in the mountains. Thus the King of Kings left his
   glory-throne to seek and win the church for his bride. He despised not
   stable nor manger. He has sought the lowest and neediest, "My friend,
   my fair one rise up, and come away." His love covers the multitude of
   our sins. He calls us "fair" and makes us fair. Then comes the
   rapturous utterance, "My beloved is mine and I am His," Song 2:16.
   Christ is ours.
    1. Because of the free gift of Himself "He loved me and gave Himself
       for me."
    2. He is ours if we believingly take Him to ourselves, for faith has
       marvellous power.
    3. He is ours if we joyfully realize His life to us. Many fail right
       here. A child will cry even in its mother's arms. But the arms are
       all the same. It is unspeakably blessed to realize all that Christ
       is to our souls.

   Every Christian is Christ's.
    1. By creation. "It is He that hath made us," Psalm 100.
    2. By the purchase of His blood.
    3. By the conquest of His spirit.

   To the believing, Christ-loving soul, He is the "Rose of Sharon, and
   the Lily of the Valley, the chief among ten thousand." Those who have
   found him and know Him with real spiritual knowledge, count other
   objects of human desire as nothing in comparison with Him! "What things
   were gain to me," says Paul, "those I counted loss for Christ!"

   Then let us again:--
    1. Make a definite dedication of ourselves to Christ.
    2. Be very careful not to offend Him in our conduct.
    3. Prove our devotion by obedience to His commands.
    4. Defend Him and His cause against all His present-day enemies.
    5. Seek to extend His kingdom from shore to shore.

  Great Fact II. The Wedding Festival.

   Song 3:6; Song 4; Song 5:1.

   We have here but a glimpse of the glad festival, but it suggests the
   whole. Solomon is seen surrounded by his bodyguard advancing towards
   Jerusalem. The daughters of Jerusalem go forth to meet him. He is
   crowned with the splendid crown made by his mother for the happy day.
   Next follows a beautiful song in which the bridegroom addressed the
   bride. She responds with a song of delight, in which she gives herself
   entirely to her husband, Song 4:16. In response to the bride's
   invitation to enjoy the pleasant fruits of the garden, the bridegroom
   responds with great satisfaction, Song 5:1.

   LESSON--It was a great thing for the poor bride from Lebanon to be
   brought into the court of the king whose magnificence filled the Queen
   of Sheba with -wonder and delight. But "eye hath not seen nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   hath prepared for them that love Him." 1 Corinthians 2:9. The day is
   coming when the Lord Jesus will present the church unto Himself, as a
   glorious bride, holy and without blemish. King Solomon went out of
   Jerusalem in royal pomp to meet his betrothed. When the marriage of the
   Lamb is come "The Lord Himself shall come to meet us," (read 1
   Thessalonians 4:16-17). The heart of man cannot conceive of the bliss
   of that moment, when the heavenly bridegroom shall bring home the
   church. His, bride. The union of Christ and the church will be
   perfected forever. We shall enjoy our heritage as heirs of God and
   joint-, heirs of Christ. Eternity will be one blessed honeymoon.

  Great Fact III. Temporary Separation.

   Song 5:2-6:3.

   A cloud passes over the sun. The bright ness of the bridal bliss is
   obscured for a while. Under the figure of a dream the bride describes a
   brief separation of her heart from the bridegroom, her misery, her
   longing and searching for her beloved, and her appeal to her companions
   to help her. They draw from her the fullness of her love by asking
   questions, and ask, "Where is thy beloved gone?"

   LESSON--When the sun is eclipsed it does not cease to shine, though its
   rays may not reach the earth. And when Christ is hidden, He remains
   Himself "the same yesterday, and today, and forever." However there
   have been times in the history of churches and of Christians, that
   resembled the captivity of Israel, when the Lord has seemed far from
   them, and they have walked in darkness. Sometimes Christ apparently
   deserts us because of our sins, and as plants kept from light become
   unhealthy, so souls deprived of light of God's countenance lose their
   peace and strength. Our daily cares which we loved to cast upon the
   Lord, are borne upon our own shoulders with anxiety. Love of the world
   and the love of riches outweigh our love for Christ. We doubt our own
   conversions, and the realities of the blessed life Prayer affords no
   refreshment, and the Bible no precious promises. We become
   fault-finders and blame the minister and the church, when the blame of
   our discontentment lies only with ourselves. In the book we are
   studying, how the bride sought the bridegroom, as soon as the
   separation was felt! So we should ardently desire to be reconciled and
   to regain the favour we have lost!

  Great Fact IV. Reunion.

   Song 6:4-8:14.

   There is soon a reunion between the royal bridegroom and the bride, and
   she, fall of satisfaction in the love of her husband, invites him to
   return with her to the scene Of her maiden life, for there his love
   would beautify all that was familiar to her. In the thought of such
   bliss she again happiness, her companions to witness her happiness,
   Song 6:4. Bride and bridegroom are now together in restful joy,
   exchanging remembrances and confidences, presenting a picture of ideal
   love.

   LESSON--Man was made for companionship with his Saviour, and many
   beautiful expressions are used in scripture to suggest this communion.

   We may delight ourselves in the Lord, Psalm 37:4. May dwell in the
   secret place of the Most High, Psalm 91:1. We may enter into the
   holiest, Hebrews 10:19. We may have the companionship of Christ,
    1. In our occupations, whatever lawful ones they may be.
    2. In our enjoyments which are all hallowed by His gracious presence.
    3. In our sufferings, when we perhaps most need Him, and when His
       sympathy is especially precious.
    4. In our Christian service, for how can we do His work except beneath
       His smile?

   A mother was asked by her child, "Why is it that when you come from
   your room you always look so happy?" The answer was "Because I have
   been praying to my Saviour. I ask Him for His grace to make me happy
   and holy. I ask Him to assist me to keep me from committing any sin
   against Him, and above all, I ask Him to have mercy on your soul, to
   save you from the ruin of those who go down to hell." "Oh! is that the
   secret?" said the child, "Then I will come into the secret place with
   you!" Let us renew our covenant to daily use the secret place of prayer
   and Bible-reading,

   In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide.

   Oh, how precious are the lessons that I learn at Jesus' side!

   Earthly cares can never vex me, neither trials lay me low,

   For when Satan comes to vex me--to the secret place I go!

   NOTE ON THE PROPHETS--We now come to the 17 prophecies of the Old
   Testament. The prophets in their message uttered great truths that
   applied to their own times, but just as truly to the times of Christ.
   To the time of His first and of His second coming. The burdens of their
   messages was, that God would bless His covenant people with both
   temporal and spiritual blessings if they were true to Him. But if
   unfaithful then judgement should come upon them until they would
   repent, when they should be restored to God's favour and to their own
   land.

   NAME--Isaiah means "salvation of Jehovah," which is significant, as he
   was the great prophet of salvation in the Old Testament. Christ and the
   apostles quoted him more than any other prophet. Events cover 62 years,
   760-698 B. C.

   PURPOSE--To prophesy Israel's captivity, repentance and restoration,
   and the glories of the Messianic age.

   THE TIMES OF ISAIAH--Isaiah lived 780 B. C.--690 B. C. in the southern
   kingdom of Judah at Jerusalem. When he was twelve years of age the
   Assyrians invaded the land and had to be bought off with a large
   indemnity. 2 Kings 15:19. About twenty years later the northern kingdom
   (Israel) was taken into captivity. This exposed Judah to the same fate,
   but Judah's king, having declared himself to be the vassal of Assyria.
   the evil day was put off. When Hezekiah came to the throne of Judah,
   727 B. C., he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and was supported
   by Isaiah. who exhorted his countrymen not to be afraid of the
   Assyrians, Isaiah 10:24, but to depend wholly upon Jehovah. Worldly
   advisers. however, persuaded Hezekiah to make an alliance with Egypt
   against Assyria, but it was of no avail. Hezekiah was defeated and paid
   a heavy indemnity out of the Temple treasury. After a brief interval,
   Assyria again threatened Israel, hut this time acting under the advice
   of Isaiah, Hezekiah "spread the matter before the Lord," Isaiah 37:14,
   and God's decree went forth for the destruction of the Assyrian (701 B.
   C.) Sennacherib, their king, never recovered from this disaster, and he
   made no more expeditions against Palestine.

   Isaiah lived under the reigns of four icings of Judah--Uzziah, Jotham,
   Ahaz and Hezekiah. Morally and spiritually, the country was full of
   corruption, vice and irreligion. The rich lived in oriental luxury, the
   poor were oppressed. It was against these evils that Isaiah lifted up
   his voice.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Accusations.
    2. Nations.
    3. Hezekiah.
    4. Release.
    5. Messiah.
    6. Kingdom.

  Great Fact I. Accusations Against Judah and Israel.

   Isaiah 1; Isaiah 2; Isaiah 3; Isaiah 4; Isaiah 5; Isaiah 6; Isaiah 7;
   Isaiah 8; Isaiah 9; Isaiah 10; Isaiah 11; Isaiah 12.

   In this section Isaiah accuses the nation of ingratitude, folly, and
   stubborn rebellion, Isaiah 1:2-9. They have withdrawn themselves from
   God's favour by their commercial greed, heathen alliances, luxury and
   idolatry, Isaiah 2:6-9, The rulers of the people answer the charge by
   stating that they keep up all the outward ordinances of religion
   required by the law, therefore art blameless. Isaiah indignantly
   denounced such hypocrisy, Isaiah 1:15. Assures them of forgiveness if
   they repent. Isaiah 1-18, but if they continue their rebellion then the
   sword would devour them, Isaiah 1:20. In Isaiah 1, there is a
   prediction of the Assyrian invasion. In Isaiah 9, the prophet sees that
   Israel's troubles shall end through the birth of the Christ-child, who
   shall rule over the full kingdom of David in justice and in
   righteousness forever.

   LESSON--Israel was increased from the family to a nation, divinely
   raised out of bondage to a commanding position, and given a land
   flowing with milk and honey. Each step in their progress should hart
   drawn from them their gratitude, love an obedience. Israel. however,
   acknowledge, none of these obligations, but refused to know God or have
   Him in their thoughts Multitudes of Christians have followed suit. No
   wonder Isaiah scathingly denounces such evil doings!

   In Isaiah 1:18 God condescends to reason will us. He offers salvation,
   not only from punishment, hut from sin itself in all his forms, all its
   depths, all its degrees! He bids us turn from the empty ceremonies,
   that Israel was making so much of, to the Fountain filled with blood.
   He assures us that although we may be dyed scarlet, or double-dyed in
   crimson with sin, we may be "as white as snow!" No wonder the book of
   Isaiah is called "The Gospel of the Old Testament!"

  Great Fact II. Prophecies Concerning Foreign Nations.

   Isaiah 12; Isaiah; Isaiah 13; Isaiah 14; Isaiah 15; Isaiah 16; Isaiah
   17; Isaiah 18; Isaiah 19;
   Isaiah 20; Isaiah 21; Isaiah 22; Isaiah 23; Isaiah 24; Isaiah 25;
   Isaiah 26; Isaiah 27; Isaiah 28;
   Isaiah 29; Isaiah 30; Isaiah 31; Isaiah 32; Isaiah 33; Isaiah 34;
   Isaiah 35.

   Assyria. Egypt, Babylon, Damascus and Tyre are mentioned. and
   judgements upon them definitely prophesised, all of which came to pass.
   Babylon fell 200 years after this prophecy. This reminds us that other
   judgements predicted to come upon the whole world will just as surely
   come to Pass. These prophesies have a near and far view. They were
   literally fulfilled in the destructions of these nations. They will be
   spiritually fulfilled when judgement comes upon corrupt world-power,
   and corrupt religion, Revelation 6; Revelation 7; Revelation 8;
   Revelation 9; Revelation 10; Revelation 11; Revelation 12; Revelation
   13.

   Isaiah 14:12-17 refers to Satan. After the prophet denounces the
   enemies of Israel and he brings his message to a grand climax by
   outlining the final triumph of God's people.

   LESSON--The history of the world is a history of nations whom God has
   punished for their sins by final destruction. Think of Egypt, Babylon,
   Carthage, Rome and Greece. The punishment of individuals, too, is
   final. Korah for gainsaying went quickly into the pit, Numbers 16:30.
   Uzzah died for irreverence, 2 Samuel 6-7. Ananias fell dead for lying,
   Acts 5:5. God must punish in wherever He finds it.

  Great Fact III. History of Hezekiah.

   Isaiah 38; Isaiah 39.

   This history is given also in 2 Kings 18:20, and tells how Sennacherib,
   king of Assyria, came against Judah. How Hezekiah and consulted Isaiah,
   who foretold the disaster that should come upon the Assyrian army. Next
   we have the sickness of Hezekiah. and how, in answer to prayer, his
   life was spared for fifteen years. Then we have Hezekiah's folly in
   showing of his treasurers to the ambassador of the king of Babylon. and
   Isaiah's Prophecy that in process of time these same treasures would be
   carried off to Babylon.

   LESSON--Hezekiah was a great king. and that largely because he sought
   the counsel of Isaiah, and became his disciple. The rich and the great
   need the wisdom "that cometh down from above." It is true wisdom to
   take all our affairs to the Lord, to keep no difficulties hack, to hide
   no faults. God will then make good His promises, help us over all
   difficulties and abase our enemies. Not always at once but always
   eventually. Therefore, put you confidence in the Lord God.

  Great Facts IV. Coming Restoration Prophesied.

   Isaiah 39; Isaiah 40; Isaiah 41; Isaiah 42; Isaiah 43;
   Isaiah 44; Isaiah 45; Isaiah 46; Isaiah 47; Isaiah 48.

   This section is sometimes called the "Book of Comfort," because the
   prophet tells in glowing terms of the restoration of Judah, and the
   coming of Jehovah's Ideal Servant to be the Messianic King.

   LESSON--The word "Comfort" in the Bible means to strengthen. So when
   God says "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people," He means strengthen them,
   arouse them, nerve them. So we must dare to do right, dare to be true,
   dare to be brave! Sorrows may be bitter, evils may be deeply in
   trenched, but if we faint not, but fight on, tomorrow will come the
   song!

  Great Pact V. The Messiah Promised.

   Isaiah 49; Isaiah 50; Isaiah 51; Isaiah 52; Isaiah 53;
   Isaiah 54; Isaiah 55; Isaiah 56; Isaiah 57; Isaiah 58.

   Dr. J. M. Grey points out how the portrait of the Messiah becomes very
   clear in Isaiah. In Genesis the seed of the woman became the seed of
   Abraham, and the line of Judah.

   Deuteronomy spoke of Him as a Prophet like unto Moses; Samuel described
   Him as King sitting on the throne of His father, David; and now Isaiah
   pictures Him in many ways. He prophesies His virgin birth, Isaiah 7:14.
   His divine and human nature. His mission to the Gentiles as well as the
   Jews. His many names, Isaiah 9:6. His humiliation as well as His glory,
   Isaiah 53. These things were all written 700 years before they came to
   pass, and therefore impress us with their divine origin. If all these
   things were fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth, and in Him only, then He
   indeed it is who is the Son of God and God the Son!

  VI. A Glorious Kingdom to be Set Up.

   Isaiah 59; Isaiah 60; Isaiah 61; Isaiah 62; Isaiah 63;
   Isaiah 64; Isaiah 65; Isaiah 66; Isaiah 67; Isaiah 68.

   This section tells of Israel's final restoration to their land, of
   their increased prosperity and of the divine blessing resting on them
   forever. The Gentiles shall aid them in their return, Isaiah 49:22.
   This is being fulfilled at the present moment. The land will be too
   small for them, Isaiah 49:18-21. They shall be served by other nations,
   Isaiah 60:12. They shall inherit the land forever, Isaiah 60:21. God
   will rejoice in their national happiness, Isaiah 65:19.

   These promises have not yet been fulfilled, but will be when Israel is
   regathered, and Jerusalem is made the centre of Christ's glorious
   kingdom. All the prophets speak of its glory and blessedness.
   Revelation 20; tells us it will be for 1000 years. Romans 8:21; says
   the earth shall then be delivered from physical corruption. The
   wilderness shall blossom as the rose, Isaiah 35:1. The glory of the
   Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. Isaiah 11:9.
   The savage nature of beasts will be banished and a little child shall
   lead them, Isaiah 11:6. The government shall be on Christ's shoulders
   and of the increase of righteousness and peace there shall be no end.
   Isaiah 9:6. Nations shall beat their swords into ploughshares and learn
   war is no more, Isaiah 2:4.

   LESSON--Those who suffer with Christ shall reign with Him. Those who
   are faithful to the suffering Messiah, shall be rewarded by the exalted
   Messiah. In Sparta only those who had won victories were allowed to sit
   beside the king. Let us look for and hasten the coming of the golden
   Kingdom-age!

   NAME The book is named for its author, Jeremiah, who was a priest and
   prophet, and lived in the village of Anathoth, three miles northeast of
   Jerusalem. He began to prophesy while yet a young man, in the reign of
   Josiah (628 B. C.). Never did a patriot who loved his country, nor a
   preacher who loved his God, have more indignities heaped upon him for
   his faithfulness. From the first appearance of Nebuchadnezzar, king of
   Babylon, in Palestine (605 B. C.) Jeremiah announced that submission to
   his rule was the will of Jehovah. For this he was sorely prosecuted.
   After Nebuchadnezzar had taken Jerusalem in 587 B. C., Jeremiah was
   left in Palestine with the remnant, but later taken captive to Egypt,
   where he died. He exercised his prophetic ministry about a century
   later than Isaiah. Events cover 41 years, 629-588 B. C.

   TIMES OF JEREMIAH--For these, read 2 Kings 21; 2 Kings 22; 2 Kings 23;
   2 Kings 24; 2 Kings 25. While Josiah was king of Judah, the political
   and religious conditions were outwardly good, but when his older
   brother, Jehoiakim, and his successors came to the throne, they
   despised the religion of Jehovah, threw Jeremiah's prophesies into the
   fire, and idolatry and flagrant sins were openly practiced. Jeremiah
   did his best to stem the tide of evil with his warnings and entreaties,
   but in vain. Yet even when the people were doomed to captivity, he
   uttered some of his most glorious Messianic prophecies, foretelling
   that after 70 years the captivity would end with their repentance and
   restoration. We must remember that Babylon has destroyed Assyria's
   power by this time and is now mistress of the world, and the instrument
   of God's hand to chastise Judah for its sins.

   PURPOSE--To foretell the captivity that should follow Judah's
   backsliding, and the judgements that should come upon the nations for
   oppressing Judah.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Captivity.
    2. Restoration.
    3. Indignation.
    4. Lamentation.

  Great Fact I. Captivity shall follow Backsliding.

   Jeremiah 1; Jeremiah 2; Jeremiah 3; Jeremiah 4; Jeremiah 5; Jeremiah 6;
   Jeremiah 7;
   Jeremiah 8; Jeremiah 9; Jeremiah 10; Jeremiah 11; Jeremiah 12; Jeremiah
   13;
   Jeremiah 14;Jeremiah 15; Jeremiah 16; Jeremiah 17; Jeremiah 18;
   Jeremiah 19;
   Jeremiah 20; Jeremiah 21; Jeremiah 22.

   Jeremiah was Jehovah's spokesman in days of darkness and disaster. Two
   nations were threatening Judah at this time, Babylon on the east and
   Egypt on the south, and Judah not knowing with which to make an
   alliance, sought to play them off one against the other. Morally and
   spiritually, the nation had sunk lower and lower. Their backslidings
   were driving them to ruin. Different political parties urged their
   ideas upon the people, but no real reformation ensued. Jeremiah, with
   faithful prayer and weeping, points out their astonishing
   unfaithfulness to God, but they turn from him to false prophets. He
   warns them not to trust the sacrifices of the temple and in ritual to
   save the land, and tells them that they must get ready for exile. In
   chapter 17 he says that the observance of the Sabbath would bring
   blessings, but nothing can put off the captivity.

   LESSON--Backsliding was the characteristic vice of the Jewish people
   throughout the whole course of their history. Their career was one of
   perpetual sinning and repenting, until their great rejection of Christ,
   which led to the final falling away. The Jews were a representive
   people and their history is often a true reflection of individual
   lives. It is remarkable how many of the saints of the Bible proved weak
   at their strongest point. Abraham, the man of faith, was noted for his
   acts of unbelief. Moses, pre-eminent for meekness, was overcome by
   anger. Job, the example of patience, became impatient. Peter, the
   boldest in the hour of danger, turned coward. It is a sad sight to see
   a wrecked ship, or a church building in ruins, but a backslider is a
   sadder sight still. "Let us watch and pray that we may not enter into
   temptation."

  Great Fact II. Repentance and Restoration. Foretold.

   Jeremiah 24; Jeremiah 25.

   As clearly as Jeremiah prophesies the captivity, he also foretells a
   return to Jerusalem of a portion of the people. He has a clear vision
   of Christ coming to reign in Jeremiah 23. The sign of the figs typifies
   their return, Jeremiah 24. The captivity should end in 70 years,
   Jeremiah 25. Even the vessels of the Lord's house shall be returned,
   Jeremiah 28. Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, Jeremiah 33. The Rechabites
   were faithful in not drinking wine, Jeremiah 35.

   LESSON--The language of these prophecies plainly shows that the divine
   author has in mind not only the return of Judah from Babylon, but also
   the return of all the twelve tribes from among the Gentile nations
   where they are today. Every prophecy not yet come to pass will be
   fulfilled literally at Christ's second coming. Just as God does not
   restore Israel until they are healed of their unholiness, so healing of
   the soul comes before the blessings of redemption.

  Great Fact III. Indignation upon Oppressing Nations.

   Jeremiah 45; Jeremiah 46; Jeremiah 47; Jeremiah 48; Jeremiah 49;
   Jeremiah 50; Jeremiah 51; Jeremiah 52.

   In this section the prophet predicts the downfall of Egypt, the
   spoiling of the Philistines, the confounding of Moab and Ammon, the
   wasting of the secret places of Edom, and the desolating of Damascus,
   Kedar and Elam. In Jeremiah 50; Jeremiah 51; the end of Babylon is
   seen, and her place is to be taken by spoilers from the north.

   LESSON--A country's safeguard is not in commerce, or Tyre would not
   have fallen. Not in art, or Greece would never have perished. Not in
   strong political organization, or Rome would have continued. Not in
   armies, or Germany would now be the victor of the world. Not in
   religious ceremonies, or Jerusalem or Rome would be the most
   influential cities today. No! righteousness, and it alone, exalteth a
   nation, and safeguards its people. When Israel was God-fearing she was
   mighty. When she fell into the wicked ways of nations around her, she
   and they were brought low. Further, in Genesis 12:3, God said He would
   punish those who injured Israel, and this has been fulfilled in the
   experience of all ancient and modern nations. Witness Russia today. It
   behoves us as a nation to maintain a just and benevolent attitude
   towards the Jews.

  Great Fact IV. The Lamentations of Jeremiah.

   Lamentations 1; Lamentations 2; Lamentations 3; Lamentations 4;
   Lamentations 5.

   This book consists of live Lamentations, or songs of sorrow, over the
   destruction of Jerusalem, 587 B. C., and over the condition of the
   captives. It pictures the deepest suffering; but the righteousness of
   God is confessed and prayer is offered for pardon and acceptance.
   Resolutions are made to obey the Lord, and all classes are called to
   join in a national reformation. In Lamentations 3, there is much
   comfort in the thought of God's unceasing mercies.

   LESSON--In times of distress, Jeremiah found his brightest hope in "the
   Lord's mercies, which are new every morning!" We may sometimes forget
   them or abuse them, but they are ever new. Just as God keeps the old
   world green by renewing it every spring, so, He refreshes His people,
   by spring times of grace. When clouds come, let us see God's rainbow
   covenant of mercy through the clouds as Noah did in Genesis 9:13. When
   we sin let us remember the mercy seat of Exodus 23:17-22; where we may
   be received back by Jehovah. God's mercies are ever new and
   everlasting. This does not mean that God is merciful at the expense of
   His truth, holiness and wisdom. Israel's history proves this. Yet God
   is the Father of all mercy, and all His children can say with the
   Psalmist, "Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of
   my life!"

     * Friday--Vision of the Dry Bones,--Ezekiel 37:1-14
     * Saturday--Two Sticks are Israel and Judah,--Ezekiel 37:15-24.

   NAME--The book is named after its author, Ezekiel, who was a priest and
   a major prophet. He was carried captive to Babylon, 597 B. C., about
   eleven years before the destruction of Jerusalem. He lived at the time
   of Daniel and Jeremiah, and was a disciple of the latter while in
   Jerusalem. He received his call at the age of 30, and prophesied for 22
   years. He was a man of intense moral earnestness and of deep personal
   humility, and conspicuous for his fidelity to Jehovah in the trying
   times of the exile.

   TIME OF EZEKIEL--The northern Ezekiel 4; Ezekiel 5; Ezekiel 6; Ezekiel
   7; kingdom, Israel, had been in captivity, for over 100 years.
   Nebuchadnezzar had descended upon Jerusalem of the southern kingdom,
   and carried away 10,000 of its chief citizens, among whom was Ezekiel.
   This judgement did not sober its idol-mad and vice-intoxicated
   inhabitants, but only plunged them deeper into superstition and
   wickedness. Like their fathers, they were a rebellious nation and a
   stiff-hearted, people, who set up idol-groves upon the high hills, and
   defiled Jehovah's sanctuary with abomination, Ezekiel 5:11. Far away
   from his native land, by the rivers of Babylon, Ezekiel preached
   against the national sins of his people in some remarkable visions, but
   like Isaiah, he closed his message with a description of the Messiah's
   glorious reign. Events cover 21 years, 595-574 B. C.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To dispel foolish hopes of a speedy deliverance from the yoke of
       Babylon.
    2. To expose the backslidings of Judah.
    3. To call the Jews to individual, Ezekiel, who was a priest and a
       dual repentance.
    4. To call out a new Israel which could inherit the promises.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Rebukes.
    2. Enemies.
    3. Future.

  Great Fact I. Rebukes and Prophecies of Judgement.

   Ezekiel 1; Ezekiel 2; Ezekiel 3; Ezekiel 4; Ezekiel 5; Ezekiel 6;
   Ezekiel 7; Ezekiel 8;
   Ezekiel 9; Ezekiel 10; Ezekiel 11; Ezekiel 12; Ezekiel 13; Ezekiel 14;
   Ezekiel 15;
   Ezekiel 16; Ezekiel 17; Ezekiel 18;Ezekiel 19; Ezekiel 20; Ezekiel 21;
   Ezekiel 22;
   Ezekiel 23; Ezekiel 24.

   First we have the call and commission of the prophet in four visions,
   Ezekiel 1; Ezekiel 2; Ezekiel 3. The prophecy given six years
   beforehand of the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Ezekiel 4;
   Ezekiel 5; Ezekiel 6; Ezekiel 7. The greatness of Judah's iniquity
   shown in several visions, the results of which they must bear on their
   own heads, as no help will come from Egypt to save them from captivity,
   Ezekiel 8; Ezekiel 9; Ezekiel 10. Judah's sins are enumerated, and
   Jehovah's chastisement of the nation is justified, Ezekiel 20; Ezekiel
   21; Ezekiel 22; Ezekiel 23; Ezekiel 24.

   God had wonderfully favoured his people, Israel. They had been blessed
   with more illustrious men than other nations, mightier and more
   wonderful deeds had been done for them than for any other people, a
   clearer and brighter revelation of God had been given them, a purer and
   nobler worship had been instituted among them. All these privileges
   were given that others might be blessed through them. Psalm 67:12. But
   "she quarrelled with God's judgement more wickedly than did the heathen
   nations," and grew daring and defiant in her disobedience. They were
   therefore punished with famine, pestilence and dispersion.

   LESSON--The oft-repeated mistake of Israel was to consider itself a
   privileged nation, sure of the favour of God in spite of its
   unfaithfulness. Many Christians flatter themselves with the same
   delusion. Yet. God never spares a sin or a sinner. In the discipline of
   the Christian life, God is always fighting against sin, and He will not
   cease until He plucks every viper from our lives, Matt. 3:12. The tears
   of Gethsemane were not a substitute for the Cross of Calvary. The tears
   of regret will not wash away God's judgement for sin. "Could my tears
   forever flow, could my zeal no respite know, all for sin could not
   atone. Christ must save and Christ alone!"

  Great Fact II. Prophecies Against Judah's Enemies.

   Ezekiel 25; Ezekiel 26; Ezekiel 27; Ezekiel 28; Ezekiel 29; Ezekiel 30;
   Ezekiel 31; Ezekiel 32.

   In these eight chapters the prophet has no word to speak concerning
   Judah and Israel, but the divine woe is pronounced against the seven
   neighbouring nations which had shown the most hostility to them: Ammon,
   Moab, Edom, Philistia. Tyre, Sidon and Egypt. The capture of Tyre and
   its ruin by Nebuchadnezzar is foretold. Egypt shall be desolate forty
   Years. The prince of Tyre, Ezekiel 28:11-19, is a type of the prince of
   this world, Satan. His unfallen state is here described, as is his fall
   in Isaiah Ezekiel 14:12-14. Satan is the inspirer of all pride such as
   ruined Tyre. God exercises His judgements over the whole earth. Seven
   nations are here mentioned because seven is the number of completeness.
   The nations around Israel regarded Jehovah as a tribal god. But Christ
   announced a judgement of all nations would follow that of Israel,
   Matthew 25:32. God visits national sin with national judgements. Not
   only will individuals be judged, but each nation as a whole will have
   to answer for its national sins, of oppression, Sabbath breaking,
   drunkenness, graft and corruption.

   LESSON--A nation by Its collective action possesses national
   responsibility. If the people sin, the people suffer. Witness Germany
   and Russia. It a people repent and call upon God, national calamities
   are averted. National pride should give away to national goodness, and
   national power to national kindness. "The righteous Lord loveth
   righteousness."

  Great Fact III. Future Restorations and Glory of Israel.

   Ezekiel 33; Ezekiel 34; Ezekiel 35; Ezekiel 36; Ezekiel 37; Ezekiel 38;
   Ezekiel 39;
   Ezekiel 40; Ezekiel 41; Ezekiel 42; Ezekiel 43; Ezekiel 44; Ezekiel 45;
   Ezekiel 46; Ezekiel 47; Ezekiel 48.

   These discourses were delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem, in
   which he pictures the happy return to Israel to their own land,
   henceforward to dwell in safety, and secure from former calamities. The
   land shall have renewed beauty and fertility. The nation, although then
   dry bones, should live again. Ezekiel, like John in the Book of
   Revelation, had a vision of a glorious temple to be rebuilt. The
   ever-growing river coming out of the sanctuary, speaks of the
   increasing prosperity and blessedness that should come to the land.
   Gog, of the land of Magog, which is likely Russia, heading some
   northern European powers, will make a great attempt to destroy this new
   kingdom, but will utterly fail, Ezekiel 38; Ezekiel 39. The temple
   shall be the centre of Israel's life and God will dwell among them, and
   He will be their God and they shall be His people.

   It is evident that the prophet has in view, not only the return after
   70 years, but the later gathering of the Jews !torn among the Gentiles,
   and their final return for millennial place and glory, when Christ
   shall sit on the throne of his father David, and rule the earth in
   righteousness .

   The reasons for this interpretation are as follows:--
    1. In the first restoration only those who were so minded, came back
       from Babylon, Ezra 7:13., while many remained in Babylon, Egypt,
       and elsewhere, but in the final restoration not one will be left,
       Ezekiel 34:11-13 and Ezekiel 39:28-29.
    2. In the first restoration only Jews (southern kingdom) returned, but
       in the final restoration both Judah (two tribes) and Israel
       (northern ten tribes) will return, 36:10, and Jeremiah 3:18.
    3. At the first restoration they returned to be over thrown and driven
       out again. But in the final restoration they shall return to
       remain, and go out no more. They shall be exalted, and dwell safely
       and the Gentile nations shall flow unto them, Ezekiel 34:28,
       Ezekiel 46:11-12.
    4. In the first restoration, because of their blindness and hard,
       stony hearts, they rejected and killed Jesus. But in the final
       restoration they shall repent of all this, and have clean hearts,
       and accept Christ who shall be their King, Ezekiel 36:24-28;
       Ezekiel 37:23-27.
    5. Nothing has ever yet been built like the temple which Ezekiel
       describes in chapters 40-48 but in the final restoration the
       prophecy will be literally fulfilled and each tribe shall be
       located exactly as stated by the prophet Ezekiel, and the apostle
       John, Ezekiel 48:22-35, Revelation 21:11-13.

   LESSON--The final restoration of Israel is one of the triumphant
   certainties of scripture, and it is closely connected with the Lord's
   Second Coming, Psalm 102:16.

   W. E. B. gives the order of events as follows:--
    1. Christ sets up His millennial kingdom (we are now in the kingdom of
       grace), and all that offend are gathered out of the land.
    2. He judges first his own people the Jews, as to their fidelity to
       Him, and then the nations of the earth as to their treatment of His
       people.
    3. The Lord makes a new covenant with His People, Judah and Israel,
       forgiving their iniquity, but punishing their enemies, including
       Gog (Russia) and its armies which are overthrown and destroyed.
    4. The Jews come into full possession of the full extent of their land
       according to promises.
    5. The temple and city are rebuilt according to the Divine plan, and
       the Levitical forms of worship are re-established, with some
       modifications.
    6. Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all the holy mountain, and
       Jerusalem is made a praise, the joy of the whole earth. The earth
       is full of the glory of the Lord!

   The Lord will not restore Israel nor build up Zion until he has caught
   up true believers, Colossians 3:4. Let us therefore not be
   cold-hearted, world-conforming Christians, but earnest, watchful and
   true, ever seeking the conversion of souls, that when the king shall
   come we shall be ready to go out to meet Him!Matthew 25:6.

   WRITER--Daniel was one of the royal princes who was carried into
   captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. He was well-favoured in person, and
   cultured in mind, so that he was given an apartment in the king's
   palace, and received daily portions of the ring's food and wine. He
   proposed, however, not to defile himself with food that lad been
   offered to idols, and lived instead on a vegetable diet. His first
   appearance in public was as an interpreter of the image dream of the
   king. He himself had some wonderful visions. He also was a statesman
   who held high offices under three successive kings, Nebuchadnezzar,
   Belshazzar and Darius. While in the service of Darius he was put in the
   lion's den for praying to his God. However, the God in whom he trusted
   closed the mouths of the lions and he came out unharmed, and his
   accusers, instead, were destroyed by the lions. He lived through the
   whole 70 years of the captivity and saw the return under King Cyrus as
   recorded in the hook of Ezra.

   TIME COVERED--607 to 534 B. C. about 73 years.

   PURPOSE--To show that God controls not only the lives of the Hebrew
   captives, but the mighty empires of the earth.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. History.
    2. Prophecy.

  Great Fact I. Historical Section.

   Daniel 1; Daniel 2; Daniel 3; Daniel 4; Daniel 5; Daniel 6.

   Daniel 1, shows us the faithfulness of Daniel and his three companions
   to their religious convictions, in not eating heathen food. "His
   loyalty he kept, his faith, his love."--Milton.

   In Daniel 2, Nebuchadnezzar dreams and forgets his dream. His wise men
   cannot help him, and Daniel, to whom God has revealed the dream and the
   meaning, is called in. The dream of the king was of a great image with
   head of fine gold, breast and arms of silver, stomach and thigh of
   brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay. A stone
   cut out of a mountain without hands smote the image upon its feet and
   destroyed it.

   Daniel's interpretation was that the image represents the greatness and
   splendour of the Gentile world powers. The head of gold is the
   BABYLONIAN EMPIRE, 626-636 B. C., and the beginning of the time of the
   Gentiles. Luke 21:24.

   The breast and arms of silver represent the MEDO-PERSIAN EMPIRE, which
   conquered and succeeded that of Babylon, and stood from 636-330 B. C.
   Its power began with Cyrus under whom the Jews returned to Jerusalem.
   Ezra 1:1. The stomach and thighs of brass represent the GREEK EMPIRE,
   which under Alexander the Great, conquered the entire Persian world,
   Daniel 2:39. This stood from 330-321, and at Alexander's death was
   divided among his four generals. The legs of iron represent the ROMAN
   EMPIRE, Daniel 2:40, one leg being the eastern and the other the
   western divisions with capitals at Constantinople and Rome. The ten
   toes represent the ten future kingdoms to arise from the breaking up of
   the two divisions of the Roman Empire, which stood from 27 B. C. to 476
   A. D. The stone cut out of the mountain without hands represents the
   coming of Christ in glory in the time of the ten kings, to set up an
   everlasting kingdom, Daniel 2:46.

   Daniel 3, tells how Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden idol and required
   all to fall down and worship it. Daniel's three friends Shadrach,
   Meshach and Abednego, refused to do so and were cast into the fiery
   furnace, but were miraculously delivered by their God.

   Daniel 4, tells of the king's dream of a great tree which was cut down.
   This was meant to be a warning to Nebuchadnezzar, but a year later he
   lost his mind and became a madman, because he set himself up as a rival
   against Almighty God.

   Daniel 5, gives the record of the king's great feast. (Belshazzar had
   succeeded Nebuchadnezzar) and how he wickedly took the golden vessels
   from Solomon's temple and used them for drinking wine to the idols. An
   angry God caused handwriting to appear on the wall, and Daniel
   explained that the message meant, "Thou art weighed in the balances and
   found wanting." In that night the king was slain. Exodus 20:3. says
   "Thou shalt have no other Gods before me!"

   LESSON--Daniel stands before us as a magnificent example of moral
   heroism. Although he held a high position in Babylon, he daily walked
   with God, and he kept up the practice of David of praying three times
   daily. When he was eighty years old, the king's friends through envy
   thought to depose him, but his faith in God triumphed, and he was
   delivered. Even his enemies could not question his uprightness, and his
   noble stand for principle will shine through the ages. "Dare to be a
   Daniel, dare to stand alone, dare to have a purpose true and dare to
   make it known!"

  Great Fact II. The Prophetical Section.

   Daniel 7; Daniel 8; Daniel 9; Daniel 10; Daniel 11; Daniel 12.

   In Daniel 7 the prophet sees four wild beasts coming up from a stormy
   sea, a lion, a bear, a leopard and a terrible beast with great iron
   teeth and ten horns. Among the ten horns there came up another little
   horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the
   roots, Daniel 7:8. Then a judgement scene is pictured, in which
   everlasting dominion is seen in the hands of Christ, Daniel 7:13-14.

   This vision of the four beasts covers the same ground as the great
   image vision of Daniel 2, but in this vision the four empires are
   represented as fierce beasts, because of their cruelty and oppression.

   The little horn coming up among the ten is the anti-Christ yet to come,
   represented in Revelation 13:10, as the beast coming up out of the sea,
   Daniel 7:15-28. The saints will be oppressed by the anti-Christ until
   the coming of Christ. This is the period of the Great Tribulation
   spoken of in Revelation 6; Revelation 7; Revelation 8; Revelation 9;
   Revelation 10; Revelation 11; Revelation 12; Revelation 13; Revelation
   14; Revelation 15; Revelation 16; Revelation 17; Revelation 18;--the
   period between the coming of the Lord for His saints, and His coming
   with His saints to reign.

   In Daniel 8, Daniel has a vision of a ram with two horns, which is
   overcome by a he-goat with one horn, which in turn is overcome by four
   notable horns, and they in their turn were followed by one which waxed
   great. The ram represent the Medo-Persian Empire, which was over-come
   by the Greek Empire. The four notable horns are the four kingdoms into
   which the Greek Empire was divided. The little horn, fierce and of
   mighty power, is Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria, who invaded
   Palestine, murdered 40,000 Jews, desecrated the temple, and brought
   upon them the saddest experiences of their history.

   In Daniel 9, while Daniel is praying toward the end of the captivity
   that God would forgive their sins and cause His face to shine upon the
   sanctuary, the angel, Gabriel, drew near and told him what would take
   place before the Messiah should come. He told Daniel that seventy
   seven-year periods would lapse before the national chastisement would
   be ended, and the nation re-established in everlasting righteousness,
   Daniel 9:24. The first seven of the seven-year periods (49 years) began
   at the command to build and restore

   Jerusalem in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. The second period of 433
   years (627-year periods) began at the building of the walls. and
   continued until Christ was cut off (crucified). The last seven-year
   period will not begin until after the church-age because these periods
   deal strictly with Israel and not the church. This last seven-year
   period will begin with the anti-Christ in power and in covenant with
   the Jews. In the middle of the seven years, he will break the covenant
   and cause Time of Trouble of Daniel 12:1, which is the same as the
   Great Tribulation of Revelation.

   Daniel 11, describes the conflicts between the kings of the north
   (Syria) and the kings of the south (Egypt), ending with a description
   of Antiochus Epiphanes and the anti-Christ. The former is the little
   horn of Daniel 8, and the latter is the little horn of Daniel 7.

   Daniel 12:2-3 gives us the two resurrections. The resurrection to
   everlasting life, which is followed a thousand years after by the
   resurrection to shame and everlasting contempt. See also Revelation
   20:5. In the first verse of this chapter we have the Time of Trouble or
   Tribulation, that comes between the two resurrections. This will last
   half the seven-year period, or three and one-half years.

   LESSON--Daniel is the great prophet of the future in the Old Testament.
   More than any other, he had visions of the end of the age. They were
   given for our prayerful study and should not be neglected as they
   usually are. Let us have faith in the sure word of Prophecy, remember
   the Almighty Word-giver behind it, and light up the present with the
   sunshine of future glory.

   So many of the prophecies of this book have been fulfilled, that the
   Bible must he the Word of God, and if the scripture is the Word of God,
   then Christianity must be true, and if Christianity is true, then we
   ought to love its Author, and practice His teachings.

      Lesson No. 26--Take Your Bible to Class for Reading the Scriptures.

LESSON THEME:--HOSEA

   Hosea 2:14-20.
     * KEY WORD--"RETURN."
     * KEY VERSE--Hosea 6:2.
     * KEY PHRASE--"ISRAEL'S UNFAITHFULNESS TO GOD."

   Home Readings.
     * Sunday--Promises of mercy,--Hosea 2:14-20.
     * Monday--Undying love of Jehovah,--Hosea 3.
     * Tuesday--Wilful ignorance,--Hosea 4:6-11.
     * Wednesday--Withdrawn face of Jehovah,--Hosea 5:9-15.
     * Thursday--A cake not turned,--Hosea 7:1-8.
     * Friday--Jehovah yearns over his people,--Hosea 11:1-8.
     * Saturday--Entreaty to return,--Hosea 14.

   WRITER--Hosea was a prophet of the northern kingdom, Israel, to whom
   his preaching was directed. His name means "The Lord is my help." At
   God's command he married a woman who was an idolater, and to their
   three children he gave typical names, speaking of the rejection and
   dispersion of Israel. After a time Hosea's wife, feeling a restraint in
   the prophet's home, fled from her husband and was unfaithful to him.
   Hosea, seeking her, found her deserted and despised, sold as a slave.
   Yet his love was not wearied out. He purchased her freedom, and took
   her to his house to atone for her sin in repentance. Hosea taught, that
   just as he had been wounded by the conduct of his unfaithful wife, so
   God is hurt by the backsliding of Israel.

   TIMES OF HOSEA--By reading 2 Kings 15; 2 Kings 16; 2 Kings 17; one will
   understand the condition of Israel at this time. Outwardly the land was
   enjoying prosperity. Military victories had enlarged the land and
   caused trade to flourish, and the forms of religion were observed. Yet
   inwardly the nation was decaying. The people were discontented under
   the oppression of corrupt rulers. Baal worship with all its wicked
   ceremonies, was eating out the purity and uprightness of the nation. It
   was said of all the kings of Israel at this time "that they did evil in
   the sight of the Lord." Assyria was about to crush Israel. Hosea
   pleaded with them to return unto God and seek His help. When they
   refused, God left them to their fate.

   TIME OF WRITING--About 725 B. C. Book covers period of 60 years,
   785-725 B. C. While Isaiah and Micah were prophesying in Judah, Hosea
   and Amos prophesying in Israel.

   PURPOSE--To show God's yearning love for unfaithful Israel.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Unfaithfulness.
    2. Decline.
    3. Hope.

  Great Fact I. Israel's Unfaithfulness to God.

   Hosea 1; Hosea 2; Hosea 3.

   The state of the chosen people is symbolized by the prophet taking an
   evil woman to be his wife. Yet Israel had no more to recommend her to
   God's love than this woman had when Hosea married her. Just as the wife
   espoused to a loving husband, enjoys the protection of home and owes
   all her provision to her husband, so Israel, chosen by Jehovah and
   brought by Him into a fertile land, has received all she had from Him
   alone. Under the type of the wife departing from her husband, Israel is
   seen departing from God. She will receive a full reward for her
   wickedness, but this shall lead to her repentance and restoration. As
   Hosea received back his wife through love, so because of divine. love,
   God will receive back His chosen nation.

   LESSON--Not only is God the Maker and Redeemer of His spiritual Israel,
   but He is also the Divine Husband, admitting her into tenderest
   relationship, and conferring upon her special favours. Therefore she
   should bind herself "to keep to Him only." He alone is to be worshipped
   and obeyed. In contrast to this, Israel, like many Christians, went
   after other lovers, and attached herself to any other worthless lover
   who wooed her. God cannot view such conduct with indifference. He
   claims all our love. The least departure from scriptural faith is
   spiritual unchastity. Let us guard the spiritual honour of ourselves
   and families as zealously as we do our moral honour.

  Great Fact II. The Decline of Israel.

   Hosea 4; Hosea 5; Hosea 6; Hosea 7; Hosea 8; Hosea 9; Hosea 10.

   In this section the prophet strongly reproves Israel for swearing,
   lying, killing, stealing and idolatry of the worst sort. At times he
   has the tender compassion of Christ when he wept over Jerusalem. At
   other times he denounces them for their blindness in not seeing that
   they must reap a harvest of Judgement. Not only were the people guilty,
   but the priests were also. They had failed to preach the Law, and had
   pretended not to see national idolatry, on account of the profit they
   got from it. The calf-worship and sacrifices brought them many fees, so
   instead of rebuking it they encouraged it. No wonder the nation went to
   the bad, for "Like priest, like people."

   LESSON--There is a solemn responsibility resting upon the preachers and
   teachers of a nation. If they are faithful in their duty the standards
   of God will never be permanently lowered. Too often, however, the moral
   and spiritual tone of the community reacts upon the religious leaders,
   instead of their influence reacting upon the community. How can the
   nation have right ideas of God's spirituality, His holiness and moral
   demands unless preachers, teachers and parents teach, not only the
   interesting stories of the Bible, but the requirements of God, as given
   in all the books of the Bible Luxury, ambition, greed, self-indulgence
   and irreverence are as moths eating at the vitals of the nation.
   Nothing but the whole gospel of God, taught, preached and practiced can
   uphold the greatness and glory of a nation.

  Great Fact III. The Hope of Israel.

   Hosea 11; Hosea 12; Hosea 13; Hosea 14.

   Wave after wave of threatened wrath had rolled over Israel, but God now
   offers them grace upon grace. Hosea makes a strong and gracious appeal
   to Israel to return unto the Lord and be forgiven. He reminds them what
   Jehovah has been to the Hebrew people.
    1. A loving father, Hosea 11:1. They bore his name. Enjoyed daily
       access to Him. Obtained needed protection and provision from Him.
       He subjected them to suitable training and discipline. He has an
       eternal inheritance awaiting them. All this is beautifully true of
       the Christian.
    2. Jehovah was a careful nurse, Hosea 11:3. He knew His people's
       needs. Was touched with a feeling of their infirmities. Took upon
       Himself the entire charge of the nation. Set up the tabernacle for
       them as a spiritual kindergarten, and patiently healed their
       backslidings. God is the same careful Nurse to His spiritual
       children. He bears up the believer and bears with him. He raises
       him when he falls, heals his bruises and is "a present help in the
       time of trouble." The path of duty may lead a believer into
       slippery places, but "underneath are the everlasting arms."
    3. Jehovah was a kind master, Hosea 11:4. He did not treat them as
       slaves but as sons. He drew them with bands of love, which means
       that he was tender and persuasive with them. When they served God
       they were the most prosperous, which showed that "His yoke was
       easy." In like manner the Lord deals with His redeemed people. "He
       takes off the yoke of guilt, the yoke of sin, the yoke of the law,
       the yoke of unrest and the yoke of fear." And "He lays meat unto
       them"-the hidden manna of His grace, and "the fatness of His
       house."

   LESSON--Just as the church is spoken of as the bride of Christ,
   Ephesians 5:25, because He gave Himself to redeem it, in love is
   purifying it, and one day will present it to Himself a spotless bride;
   so in Hosea, Israel is seen to be the wife of Jehovah, now disowned,
   but one day to be forgiven and restored. This is the hope of Israel.
   They failed to realize this hope at Christ's first coming. They now
   direct it to His second coming. Yea, His appearing is also the "blessed
   hope" of the church.

   The supreme lesson of the book is "that the ways of the Lord are
   right." He knows wherein our true good lies. Taking the way He
   prescribes, we shall most certainly attain to blessedness!

    Lesson No. 27--Take Your Bible to Bible Class for Reading the Scripture.

LESSON THEME:--JOEL

   Joel 2:28-32.
     * KEY WORD--"OUTPOURING."
     * KEY VERSE--Joel 2:28.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE TWO OUTPOURINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT."

   Home Readings.

   Let us be encouraged to read a book of the Bible each week in
   connection with this course. This week read the book of Joel, using the
   following selections for the family altar:--
     * Sunday--Chastening of Judah by locusts,--Joel 1:1-12.
     * Monday--Call to repentance,--Joel 1:13-20.
     * Tuesday--Warriors, like locusts, will invade land,--Joel 2:1-11.
     * Wednesday--The Lord's pity and favour,--Joel 2:18-27.
     * Thursday--The Holy Spirit poured out,--Joel 2:28-32.
     * Friday--Judgement of nations at Lord's return,--Joel 3:1-8.
     * Saturday--Full Kingdom Blessing,--Joel 3:16-21.

   WRITER--Joel a prophet of Judah wrote this book. His name means
   "Jehovah is God." He lived in Jerusalem, and is thought to have been
   one of the priests of the temple.

   TIME--Many scholars claim that Joel is the earliest of the prophetic
   books, and that he ministered in the reign of Joash, king of Judah,
   about 860 B. C. While he was prophesying in Judah in the south, Elijah
   and Elisha were preaching in Israel in the north.

   PURPOSE--To show that the locusts swarming into the land were
   figurative of the nations who should swarm upon Israel, but if the
   people would repent, then God would deliver them, and pour out His
   Spirit upon them.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Plague.
    2. Fast.
    3. Blessing.

  Great Fact I. Plague of Locusts.

   Joel 1.

   The occasion of this prophecy was four successive plagues of locusts
   and a severe drought which desolated the land. Joel calls upon the
   people to reflect upon the cause of the calamity and to mourn with true
   penitence. He urges them that it they would avoid further troubles that
   they should fast and make their supplications unto God, that He may
   bless and not curse their land. Locusts were one of the plagues of
   Egypt, Exodus 10:14; Exodus 15, and there was nothing like them for
   multitude and mischief they did. Speaking of a plague of locusts,
   Thompson says, "The number of them was incredible, the whole face of
   the country was black with them, On they came like a living deluge. We
   dug trenches and kindled fires, and beat and burnt to death heaps upon
   heaps, but the effort was utterly useless. They poured over rocks,
   walls, ditches and hedges. The roads were covered with them, all
   marching in regular lines, like armies of soldiers with the leaders in
   front, Joel 2:5. When they approached our garden all the farm servants
   were employed to keep them out, but to no avail, and when they had
   devastated our garden they passed on to another." Proverbs 30:27.

   LESSON--
    1. Those who out do their fathers in sin may justly expect sorer
       judgements than their fathers ever knew. Sometimes a terrible
       upheaval is necessary for a nation for without it wrongs will not
       be righted.
    2. If calamities come upon us because of our own faults we should
       repent and be wiser for the future. If they have befallen us
       because of the faults of others, we should live them down, for we
       have nothing with which to reproach ourselves and time will remove
       the handicap. If we have spiteful enemies, we should so live that
       their enmity may be disarmed. If we have kind and faithful friends,
       we should live to bless and protect them. If we hope for eternal
       happiness, we should prepare to enjoy it.

  Great Fact II. Exhortation to Keep Solemn Fast.

   Joel 2:2.

   In this chapter we have a further description of the plague, and the
   blast of the ram's horn called an assembly for an extraordinary fast.
   Not a soul was to be absent. It convened old and young men and women,
   and even bridegroom and bride on their wedding day. The priests dressed
   not in white robes as usual, but in black sack cloth, would prostrate
   themselves upon the ground and then turning toward the Invisible
   Presence within the sanctuary, cry, "Spare the people, O Lord."

   In answer to this, the prophet assures the people that God will indeed
   bestow upon them both temporal mercies, Joel 2:18-27, and spiritual
   blessings, Joel 2:28-32.

   Often in the prophecies some local circumstance is made the occasion of
   a far-reaching prophecy. Many scholars think that "the day of the
   Lord," Joel 2:15, refers to events at the end of the age, and Scofield
   outlines these events as follows:--
    1. The invasion of Palestine from the north by Gentile world powers
       under the Anti-Christ and false prophets,--Joel 2:1-10.
    2. The Lord's army destroys the invaders,--Joel 2:11, Revelation
       19:11-21.
    3. Repentance of Jews restored to their land,--Joel 2:12-17.
    4. Temporal kingdom blessing upon the land,--Joel 2:12-17.
    5. The outpouring of the Spirit in the last days,--Joel 2:28-29.
    6. Return of the Lord in glory and the setting up of the
       kingdom,--Joel 2:30-32.
    7. Full and permanent kingdom blessing,--Joel 3:1-16.

   LESSON--
    1. Fasting or the total abstinence from food for a certain length of
       time was practiced by the Israelites in a devotional spirit. It was
       engaged in as an evidence of sorrow for sin and associated with
       confession of sin, through it Divine favour and blessing was
       sought. The apostles practiced it, 2 Corinthians 6:5, but it does
       not seem an essential part of the gospel plan. However, self-denial
       and confession of sin should be constantly practiced, as plain
       living leads to high thinking.
    2. The prophecy of the outpouring of the Spirit had one fulfilment at
       Pentecost, Acts 2:17-21, hut it would not be right to regard that
       particular occasion as exhausting the fulfilment of the prophecy.
       Rather Pentecost was the first great example of the universal
       outpouring of the Spirit that is to take place in the Last Days.

  Great Fact III. Pall and Permanent Kingdom Blessing.

   Joel 3.

   Only by inspiration could Joel, the earliest of the prophets of Judah,
   have foretold the return from captivity. The language is such, however,
   that it is evident that the prophet had in his vision not only the
   return from Babylon, but the last regathering of the Jews from among
   the Gentiles, and the judgement of the nations after the battle of
   Armageddon as seen in Matthew 25:32; Revelation 19:18.

   After the restoration of Israel and the judgement of the nation, Joel
   3:1-2, comes the setting up of the everlasting and universal kingdom,
   Joel 3:20. That kingdom will be heaven in origin, principle and
   authority, Daniel 2:44, and will be set up on the earth, not by
   persuasion, but by power. It will be a kingdom of righteousness and
   peace. The meek not the proud, will inherit the earth, the knowledge of
   the Lord will be universal, and the out breaking of sin will be visited
   by instant judgement. With Satan's powers restricted , it is impossible
   to conceive all the spiritual and temporal blessedness that the race
   will enjoy.

   LESSON--Joel's picture of final deliverance and glory is very much like
   that of

   Zechariah in his prophecy, showing that the hope of final triumph
   dominated Israel in its dark days. So hope will keep our hearts from
   breaking under the pressure of evils, and ever hold before us the
   prospect of greater good. Deep humbling.; of heart are often the door
   of hope to joy and victory. In the Psalms of David, written in his
   deepest trouble from the persecution of Saul and the rebellion of
   Absalom, we always find some ray of hope. In 1 Peter 1:13, Peter says,
   "Hope to the end," and he is called the apostle of hope because in five
   chapters he refers ten times to the triumphs of the future.

LESSON THEME:--AMOS

   Amos 4:6-12.
     * KEYWORD--"PUNISHMENT."
     * KEY VERSE--Amos 4:12.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE NATIONS AND ISRAEL CALLED TO ACCOUNT."

   Home Readings.

   Read this lesson and then the whole hook of Amos. It is simple,
   eloquent sermon. For the family altar read:--
     * Sunday--Can Two Walk Together? Amos,--Amos 3:1-7.
     * Monday--Prepare to Meet God,--Amos 4:6-12.
     * Tuesday--Mourning over Israel,--Amos 5:1-8.

     * Friday--The Basket of Summer Fruit,--Amos 8:1-7.
     * Saturday--Future Kingdom Blessings,--Amos 9:11-15.

   WRITER--Amos was a native of Tekoa, a small town about 12 miles south
   of Jerusalem. Amos was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet, nor did
   he attend the schools of the prophets. By occupation he was a shepherd
   and a fruit-grower. As he followed the flock in Judea, God called him
   to prophesy in the northern kingdom, Israel. In obedience to this call
   he went to Bethel where the sanctuary was. There he preached with such
   earnestness and plainness or speech that Amaziah, the leading
   idolatrous priest, complained to the king and he was expelled from the
   kingdom. Ile probably returned to his home at Tekoa, where he wrote
   this book.

   TIME OF WRITING--About 760 B. C. While Uzziah was king of Judah and
   Jeroboam II. was king of Israel. Prosperity had brought great evils to
   the people. The rich lived in great luxury, and drank and feasted to
   excess amid delicate perfumes and soft strains of varied music, Amos
   6:4-6. But all this was obtained through violence and robbery, Amos
   3:10. The poor and needy were sold as slaves, and false weights and
   measures were used, Amos 2:6. The judges were corrupt, Amos 5:7, and to
   be upright was to be unpopular and to be hated, Amos 5:10.

   PURPOSE--To foretell the punishment that should come upon foreign
   nations, and to condemn Israel for its idolatry and oppression.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Nations.
    2. Israel.
    3. Visions.

  Great Fact I. Prophecies Against the Nations.

   Amos 1; Amos 2.

   The accusations against the nations were called forth because they had
   harmed other nations. Damascus standing for Syria heads the list,
   because her cruelties had been most felt, by Israel. She had been
   fiercely cruel. The Philistines come next because they had sold
   Israelites into bitter slavery. The prophet next turns to Tyre, for
   they had acted as slave agents. Edom comes next because of its hatred
   and fighting against Israel. Next comes Ammon for its wicked crimes.
   Then judgement falls upon Ammon because of their meanness and sacrilege
   in wrecking their vengeance upon a corpse. Such were the charges that
   Amos brings against the heathen neighbours of Israel, and the commerce
   which bound these nations together as the slave-trade in most odious
   form.

   LESSON--The fact that punishment came upon these nations, reminds us:--
    1. That the mightiest human kingdoms cannot prevent God's judgements
       from coining upon them. The Canaanites were a great people, yet
       because of their corruption, God took away their country from them.
       Pharaoh was the mightiest despot of the old world, yet he and his
       hosts because of their obstinacy were cast into the Red Sea.
       Napoleon and the Kaiser thought they were superior to God and acted
       independent of Him, but they were soon Put beneath His feet. God
       will not be hindered. God's helpers shall be exalted, His hinderers
       brought low.
    2. That God knows all about human sine which fact should make us
       careful and prayerful to avoid evil and devoutly Pursue the good.
       It should also impress us with the wonderful patience of God.
       Lamentations 3:22. Because of this patience He suspends His anger
       toward the wicked lest they be instantly destroyed, and instantly
       forgives and forgets the sins of the righteous it they confess
       them, 1 John 1:9.

   Said a boy: "Father forgives me when I've done wrong, but I see in his
   face all the day after, that although he does not frown, yet he
   remembers what I did in the morning. He does not forget." God forgives
   and forgets. He makes it up altogether!

  Great Fact II. Charges Against Israel.

   Amos 3; Amos 4; Amos 5; Amos 6.

   Amos now addresses both Israel and Judah. They were a chosen nation,
   therefore they should be punished. They stood more fully in the light
   and therefore they cast a darker shadow. The prophets tells them first
   about their civil oppressions. Righteousness seems to have been
   forgotten. Over their magnificent homes and courts might be written
   only cruelty and injustice. The women are contemptuously called "Kine
   of Bashan" because they were wholly absorbed in worldliness and luxury.
   The prophet tells the people that when they went on their religious
   pilgrim. age to Bethel and Gilgal it was only to add sin to sin, for
   their worship was mere formal ritual, and half idolatrous. They were
   reminded that God had sent upon them drouth, plagues and earthquakes,
   yet they repented not.

   LESSON--When God's people do not glorify Him, He glorifies Himself by
   punishing them. God never threatens, however, without offering a way of
   escape, never warns without also pleading with men to repent. Again and
   again has lie stepped from the chariot of His thunder that He might put
   His arms around some sinner and bid him come home. He has waited for
   men whom others have forgotten or are ashamed of. The Bible is terrific
   and awful beyond all other books in denouncing sin, and threatening
   wrath, yet it is shot through and through with the spirit of pity and
   mercy and hope, and no one will be finally lost except he push on by
   the divine arms of compassion.

  Great Fact III. Five Visions.

   Amos 7; Amos 8; Amos 9.

   Amos used these visions for much the same reason that the Master
   employed parables, to illustrate and enforce the messages. In the first
   vision the prophet sees green fields, but lo! God formed locusts and
   they ate the grass. Fearful lest famine should ensue if they devoured
   the crops of wheat, Amos pleads earnestly for his country and the Lord
   stays the Plague.

   In the second vision there was a fire that was so terrible that it
   devoured not the land only, but also the great deep. Again the prophet
   pleads and his prayer is heard, the Lord said: "This also shall not
   be."

   In the third vision the Lord is seen with a plumb-line measuring the
   city for destruction. This time the prophet realizes that judgement is
   so certain, that he does not have the heart to intercede.

   In the fourth vision a basket of summer fruit is seen. This meant that
   although Israel thought themselves to be sweet and luscious fruit yet
   in reality they were rotten at heart and would soon be cast aside.

   The last vision revealed the Lord standing by the altar, bidding the
   prophet to smite the doorposts and shatter the fragments upon all their
   heads. The worshippers were to be scattered until all the dinners died
   by the sword.

   As with the other prophecies this book closes with a bright picture of
   the future. The whole land should once more be one kingdom under the
   House of David. The Tabernacle of David now torn down, should be
   rebuilt and its sway should extend over all nations which are called by
   the Lord's name. There shall also be a great plenty, so that a happy
   people shall dwell in a happy land. This has not yet been fulfilled in
   a literal sense, but will be at the Lord's coming.

   LESSON--National prosperity is still awaiting the scattered children of
   Israel. The land of promise shall again flow with milk and honey.
   Jerusalem shall again be the capital of a mighty kingdom. The hills of
   Judah and the plains of Israel shall again be tilled by the children of
   Jacob. A converted Israel shall yet witness to the grace of the
   Messiah, now rejected by them, but then to be served with passionate
   devotion.

   For us now, this picture tells of the spiritual prosperity and gladness
   that should be appropriated from God's Word. Of peace which is for the
   heart of man. Of satisfaction for man's deepest wants. Of a sure
   abiding place for the faithful in the care and love of the Eternal. Of
   a Kingdom which is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Of
   songs of gladness and thanksgiving in which all the redeemed may join.

   It is only as we have faith in the literal and spiritual fulfilment of
   all God's promises that we shall toil on for our own, and for the
   world's greatest good.

      Lesson No. 29--Use Your Bible in Class. God Wrote it to be Studied.

LESSON THEME:--OBADIAH

   Obadiah 1:1-4.
     * KEY WORD--"EDOEL"
     * KEY VERSE--Obadiah 1:8.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE HATEFULNESS OF A COMMENDATION."

   Home Readings.

   The events of this prophecy probably happened at the time of the
   capture of Jerusalem. Read about them as follows:--
     * Sunday--First Deportation of Babylon,--2 Kings 24:11-16.
     * Monday--Final Deportation of Jews,--2 Kings 25:1-7.
     * Tuesday--Jerusalem Destroyed,--2 Kings 25:8-13.
     * Wednesday--Edom Shall be Brought Low,--Obadiah 1:1-9.
     * Thursday--Edom's Spiteful Behaviour Shall Be Avenged,--Obadiah
       1:10-14.
     * Friday--Guilt of Heathen Nations,--Obadiah 1:15-16.
     * Saturday--Deliverance from Captivity and Messianic
       Kingdom,--Obadiah 1:17-21.

   WRITER--Nothing is known of the personal history of Obadiah except that
   he lived in the kingdom of Judah. His name means "Servant of Jehovah."
   This is the shortest book in the Old Testament.

   TIME OF OBADIAH--Most scholars think that Obadiah wrote shortly after
   the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, about B. C. 587. The cause
   of the prophecy was Edom's shameful rejoicing over the capture and ruin
   of Jerusalem. The Edomites were the descendants of Esau, the brother of
   Jacob, and were always unfriendly to God's covenant people, Israel.
   They refused to allow Israel to pass through their land on the way to
   Canaan. Saul, David and Solomon found them to be bitter enemies, and
   kept them under stern measures. They often allied themselves with
   Israel's foes, and when Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, they gladly
   joined the invaders, helped to plunder the city and cut off stragglers
   who tried to escape. This hostile attitude towards God's people brought
   down upon Edom the severe condemnation of the prophet. Obadiah lived at
   the same time as did Jeremiah.

   PURPOSE--To prophesy the downfall of Edom because of her hatefulness
   and pride, and rise up again of Israel from her captivity.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Downfall.
    2. Cause.
    3. Triumph.

  Great Fact I. Downfall of Edom.

   Obadiah 1:1-9.

   Edom thinks herself secure in her mountain strongholds, but though she
   exalts herself as the eagle, and set her nest among the stars, the Lord
   will bring her clown and make her small among the heathens, Obadiah
   1:1-4. Robbers might cease when they had stolen enough, and grape
   gatherers might leave some gleanings, but not so the avengers of Edom,
   she shall be spoiled to the depths of her hidden treasures, Obadiah
   1:5-6. Her allies shall deceive her, and spread a net that she will not
   see, and her wisdom and power shall be of no avail, Obadiah 1:7-9.

   LESSON--The particular fault with which Edom is charged is pride. "The
   pride of thine heart hath deceived thee." Edom built among the stars,
   but God brought her down to the ground.

   Nothing so much offends God as pride, haughtiness and presumption, and
   when men display these, they may expect to, be abased to the very dust
   until they have learned humility under His correcting hand.

   There never was an angel who had pride in his heart, but he lost his
   wings as did Satan and his fallen angels, and there will never be a man
   full of conceit and self-confidence but the Lord will spoil his glories
   and trample his vain hopes in the dust. Luther used to say, "Do let God
   be God." Do not say "I and God," but "God and I." God first and I
   second. God to lead and I to follow, God to rule and I to obey. Do let
   God be God!

  Great Fact II. The Cause of Edom's Down-fall.

   Obadiah 1:10-18.

   The overthrow of Edom is due to the violence and cruelty shown to God's
   people at the time of the capture of Jerusalem. Edom and Israel had
   descended from brothers. Esau and Jacob, they were therefore cousin
   nations, yet when foreign invaders were dividing by lot the spoils and
   captives of Jerusalem, Edom maliciously rejoiced at Israel's
   misfortune, they actively shared in spoiling Israel, and stood at the
   crossroads to cut off the escape of the Jews and delivered them up, to
   the Babylonians. The prophet therefore proclaims that in the Day of the
   Lord, Edom and all the enemies of Israel shall suffer just retribution,
   meeting with the fact which they had inflicted on others.

   LESSON--The story of Edom is a severe rebuke to the unbrotherliness,
   she was full of malice, hatred and envy, and committed one unbrotherly
   act after another. Men who are brothers by blood ties, or are Christian
   brothers through the blood of Jesus Christ, should live as brothers.
   There is no room in families or in churches for the unsympathetic
   unloving elder brothers, we ought so to love one another that we do not
   hate or persecute our brokers, we ought so to love one another as God
   bath loved us, 1 John 4:11. There is a debt of mercy, pity, charity,
   com- passion and succour that one man owes another. If we refuse to pay
   it in time of our abundance, we may justly expect to be denied us in
   the time of our want.

   Frequently at the great Roman games, the emperors, in order to gratify
   the citizens, caused sweet perfumes to be rained down upon them through
   the awnings which covered the amphitheatre. The huge vases of perfume
   did not refresh, delight and gratify the people, until they were
   unsealed, opened and poured out. So each Christian heart is a potential
   vase of perfumed, loving kindness. Like our Older Brother Christ we
   were born to sympathize. Then let us constantly pour forth love's
   divine perfume, not only upon our brothers in the flesh and brothers in
   the faith, but upon the poor, the tempted and the sorrowful.

  Great Fact III. The Triumph of Israel.

   Obadiah 1:17-21.

   Edom was conquered by her enemies in 300 B. C., and has disappeared
   from history, but for the house of Jacob, there shall be deliverance
   from captivity. Jerusalem shall be a safe refuge, the borders of her
   land shall be extended while judgement shall come upon the nations, and
   the Lord's kingdom shall be set up. The fulfilment of this is yet
   future. We rejoice in the spiritual kingdom within us, but for the
   literal and complete fulfilment, we still pray "Thy kingdom come!"

   LESSON--There is a significant promise in Obadiah 1:17: "The house of
   Jacob shall possess their possessions." The perpetual possession of the
   Holy Land is promised them by all the prophets, and God will make the
   pledge good. The promise applies to the Christian also. He shall
   possess his possessions, and the word possessions here is a rare one in
   the original. A rare word is used to describe rare possessions. The
   possessions of the people of God are rare and precious. In 2
   Corinthians 6:10; Paul speaks of the believers "as possessing all
   things.' This reminds us that a man's real wealth is not anything
   outside, but is in himself. A Christian is the heir of the des if his
   mind is enriched with the highest knowledge and purest truth, If his
   heart is inspired with a goodness that responds to all that is noble
   and God-like and beats all the sweet, brave impulses of prayer,
   devotion and love.

   A gentleman once took a friend to the top of his mansion to show him
   the extent of his possessions. Pointing to a great distance on one
   side, he said: "Do you see that far-extending farm?" "Yes." "Well, that
   is mine." Pointing to the other side: "Do you see yonder stores and the
   big bank? Well, they are mine!" Pointing again to another side: "Do you
   see the village yonder? Well, all that is mine!" Said the friend: "I
   know a woman in that village who is richer than you." "How can that
   be?" asked the rich man. Said the friend: "She is far richer than you.
   She can say Christ is mine!' She sings:"

   The treasures of earth are not mine,
   I own not its silver nor gold,
   But a treasure far greater is mine,
   I have riches of value untold!
   Far better than gold or wealth untold,
   Are the riches of love in Christ Jesus.

   "One's own" what a charm there is in the words! How long before
   everyone of us will be able to say, "Christ, salvation, peace, the
   promises, Heaven-are all my own!"

        Lesson No. 30--A Bible Class, an Open Bible and a Devout Spirit

LESSON THEME:--JONAH

   Jonah 3:4-10.
     * KEY WORD--"REPENTANCE."
     * KEY VERSE--Jonah 3:10.
     * KEY PHRASE--"A GREAT CITY SAVED WHEN IT REPENTED."

   Home Readings.

   Read this lesson and then the whole book of Jonah. It is a remarkable
   and beautiful book. For family altar read:
     * Sunday--Jonah's Call and Flight from Duty,--Jonah 1:1-11.
     * Monday--Swallowed by a Great Fish,--Jonah 1:12-17.
     * Tuesday--Jonah's Prayer,--Jonah 2:1-7.
     * Wednesday--Delivered and Recommissioned,--Jonah 2:8-3:3.
     * Thursday--Nineveh Repents,--Jonah 3:1-10.
     * Friday--Jonah's Anger,--Jonah 4:1-6.
     * Saturday--Lessons of the Gourd,--Jonah 4:7-11.

   WRITER--Jonah was a native of Gathhepher, a village about an hour's
   walk north of Nazareth. Jewish legend said he was the son of the widow
   of Sarepta, whom Elijah had restored to life. But whether this is true
   or not, he was probably a disciple of Elisha, and succeeded him as a
   great preacher of righteousness. He prophesied the victories of
   Jeroboam II, king of Israel, against Syria. The next we hear of him he
   is called to leave his home and go to Nineveh and cry against it.

   TIME OF JONAH--He prophesied about 800 B. C. in the reign of Jeroboam
   II, 2 Kings 14:25. Nineveh, to which Jonah was commanded to go, was the
   capital of Assyria, and was a city of great splendour, sixty miles in
   circumference. The wickedness of the place was in proportion to its
   greatness. It was another Sodom or Gomorrah. Jonah hated to go to
   Nineveh because he knew that if it repented and was spared of God, that
   it would prevail over Israel. As a matter of fact God did use the
   Assyrians, whose capital was Nineveh, to chasten Israel by taking it
   into captivity.

   PURPOSE--To show how a city may be saved by the wonderful power of
   repentance.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Mission.
    2. Overboard.
    3. Delivered.
    4. Preaching.
    5. Anger.

  Great Fact I. Jonah's Mission.

   Jonah 1:1-11.

   God calls Jonah to go 500 miles eastward, over mountains, through
   trackless forests, and across burning deserts to Nineveh. Hating the
   idea of being a channel of blessing to the inveterate enemies of
   Israel, he fled 100 miles westward toward Tarshish on the south coast
   of Spain. right opposite Gibraltar. Jonah was willing to prophesy to
   Israel but he at first flatly refused to become a foreign missionary.

   God sent a great storm upon the vessel upon which Jonah had taken
   flight, and the ship is placed in great danger. The sailors try all
   means to save the ship, and at last cast lots to see who is the cause
   of the misfortune coming upon them. The lot points to Jonah, and he
   begs them to cast him into the sea.

   LESSON--As God called Jonah, so he is calling men today by a voice so
   distinct that they cannot misunderstand. Some people say they would
   gladly do the will of God, if they could know what it was. This,
   however, is often insincerity, for John 7:17. says, "If any man is
   willing to do His will he shall know." When God called Moses He made
   the call so plain that Moses had no rest until he responded. Samuel's
   call was repeated over and over again until he realized that it was
   God's voice and yielded to His claim. God's call to all of us is to
   repentance, faith and obedience. Dr. W. B. Riley tells how a friend of
   his in Chicago was deaf in one ear, so that when he laid down to sleep,
   he shut out all sound by burying the good ear in the pillow, and
   turning the deaf one up. So too often, we turn a deaf ear towards
   heaven, and say that God has not called us. God gives us a holy courage
   that will scorn all ease and petty excuses!

  Great Fact II. Jonah Overboard.

   Jonah 1-12-17.

   The crew of the ship made renewed efforts to get to shore, but when
   this is seen to be impossible, they take Jonah at his word and cast him
   into the sea, then the storm immediately abates and the ship sailed on
   with its awe-struck but thankful crew. Jonah is in fearful danger, but
   God so ordered events that after he had sunk to the bottom a great fish
   swallowed him up and preserved him alive for three days and nights,
   until it could cast him out upon the land.

   No miracle of scripture has called forth so much unbelief, but in
   Matthew 12:39 our Lord confirms the truth of this account. "God moves
   in a mysterious way His wonders to perform." GOD prepared a missionary
   for Nineveh, HE prepared a storm, when that missionary was disobedient,
   Ile prepared a great fish to preserve his life. He prepared a gourd. He
   appointed a host of caterpillars to strip the gourd. He appointed a
   scorching, burning wind to beat upon the head of Jonah. The whole
   account is full of the direct acts of God. Who will say that such acts
   are impossible to the Almighty Creator, who made heaven and earth and
   all that in them is?

   On the natural history side of the question, the writer has stood up in
   the skeleton of a whale that was on exhibition. It was 80 feet long and
   7 feet high when lying on its side. Frank Bullen tells of whales 70
   feet long swimming about with their lower jaws wide open so that a man
   could easily slip down without the fish hardly knowing it. Trustworthy
   records say that when a whale is dying it always ejects the contents of
   its stomach. Masses eight feet by six feet have been vomited up, as has
   a whole horse, so it is not at all incredible that this should have
   happened to Jonah. His preservation in the body of the fish was plainly
   supernatural, as was the preservation of the Hebrew children in the
   fiery furnace. In 1758 a man was swallowed by a shark. The captain on
   deck with a gun-shot the fish and caused it to cast out the sailor and
   he was rescued alive. With God all things are possible. Jonah's
   supernatural experience not only looked backward to his sin, but
   forward to Christ's burial and resurrection. Matthew 12:39.

  Great Fact III. Jonah Delivered.

   Jonah 2

   Jonah's deliverance was in answer to prayer. He prayed out of the body
   of the fish, and when submission took the place of rebellion, the Most
   High was willing to deliver the captive, to pardon the sinner to employ
   again the unfaithful runaway.

   LESSON--If you cry to God out of the depths, you will cry yourself out
   of them. A man who was bowed down by his unbelief in prayer was asked
   the question, "Do you think a loving God has written in His book today,
   on the 25th of February, 1898, William T_____, asked Me for the
   forgiveness of all his sins for My Dear Son's sake, and I refused him?"
   "No sir, I cannot believe that." "What then, has he written beside your
   prayer?" The man thought deeply for a time and then replied, "It is
   more likely He has written Granted' by its side!" From that moment the
   fetters of his fears were broken and he was set free to trample on his
   sins and to serve his Saviour.

  Great Fact IV. Jonah Preaching.

   Jonah 3.

   Jonah being called a second time now goes to Nineveh and proclaims the
   gospel in the streets of the heathen city. They were startled by the
   warnings that in forty days their city would be overthrown, and put on
   sackcloth, sat in ashes repented of their sins and cried mighty unto
   God for mercy. When God saw that they had turned from their evil ways,
   He graciously held back the threatened wrath and judgement and Nineveh
   was spared.

   LESSON--
    1. How good of God to offer a divine commission to deserters. There is
       no need for any Christian worker to be out of the harness. The word
       of the Lord comes to you a second time, "Arise and go!"
    2. Jonah's message was not a pleasant one, but he was not responsible
       for it. A preacher or teacher is like the bearer of a telegram he
       must convey the message, but not change it. God's message, plus
       Jonah's earnestness produced a miraculous effect. Think of 600,000
       on their faces in repentance before God! Surely we ought to pray
       for such a revival in every city in the land. The God who blessed
       Jonah's message and saved a great city in forty days is still our
       God.

  Great Fact V. Jonah's Anger.

   Jonah 4.

   Jonah is vexed at the sparing of Nineveh. the expectation of which had
   led, to his former flight. He therefore makes for himself a booth
   outside the city walls and yet hopes to see the city punished. God
   prepared a vine, something like castor-oil plant, to spring up and
   shade Jonah from the sun, but He also prepared a worm or host of black
   caterpillars (for the word could be a collective noun), to destroy the
   gourd and leave Jonah exposed to the scorching sun. When Jonah grieved
   bitterly for the loss of the gourd, God asked him why he wanted God to
   have pity on the gourd, but to have no pity for the great city of
   Nineveh, in which there were thousands of little children, so young
   that they knew not their right hand from their left. Thus his anger and
   selfishness were rebuked.

   LESSON--Jonah showed a streak of very ordinary human nature, but
   although we cannot justify him, we cannot help sympathizing with him.
   Most people have their weak moments, but should have fewer of them. A
   bad-tempered person ought to be compelled to give warning to all
   comers, like the lepers of old. Avoid them. Beware of it ourselves.
   Cultivate the graciousness and patience that so adorned the life of
   Christ, that the beauty of the Lord our God was upon Him.

   Micah 4:1-5.
     * KEY WORD--"SOCIAL SINS."
     * KEY VERSE--Micah 2:2.
     * KEY PHRASE--"GOD REBUKES THE RICH, THE UNWORTHY RULERS, AND THE
       FALSE PROPHETS."

   Home Readings.

   Read a chapter a day in Micah. For the family altar:--
     * Sunday--The Lord Witness Against Israel,--Micah 1:1-6.
     * Monday--Social Sins Condemned,--Micah 2:1-5.
     * Tuesday--Sins of the Rich,--Micah 3:1-8.
     * Wednesday--Future Kingdom of Messiah,--Micah 4:1-5.

     * Friday--The Lord's Requirements,--Micah 6:1-8.
     * Saturday--God Delighteth in Mercy,--Micah 7:15-20.

   WRITER--Micah was born at Moresheth, some 25 miles south of Jerusalem.
   He prophesied in the reign of Hezekiah, Jeremiah 26:18, sympathizing he
   same time as did Isaiah, about 758-700 B. C. Micah was a representative
   of the common people, and of the country life of Judea, while Isaiah
   preached to the city and the court. "To Micah the villager, the unjust
   treatment of the helpless poor by men of wealth and power is the sin
   that cries aloud to heaven. He has little to say about idolatry." He
   saw and felt keenly the social wrongs of the age.

   TIMES OF MICAH--During his life. time the northern kingdom, Israel, was
   taken Intel captivity. Israel would not heed Micah's warning, but Judah
   did and was saved for the time being. With all the other prophets he
   taught that national sins would lead to national downfall.

   PURPOSE--To show that God's plan to redeem men should not be
   frustrated, even though he had to punish his chosen people for their
   sins.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Threat.
    2. Salvation.
    3. Controversy.

  Great Fact I. Threat of Judgement.

   Micah 1; Micah 2.

   Micah begins with an account of the coming of the Lord to call Israel
   to account for its wrongs. Samaria, which was first in wickedness,
   shall be the first to fall before the avenging enemy. A similar fate
   shall befall Judah, and its people shall be deported, for among them is
   oppression, injustice and violence. The false prophets only pander to
   their evil ways. However, God will not cast them off altogether.

   LESSON--Like the Master Himself, Micah had no quarrel with the worthy
   rich, but he knew. the perils of wealth, and he saw that many who were
   exposed to that peril quickly went wrong. He insisted that too often
   the worst citizens were not the wretched poor who had everything to
   drag them down, but the idle rich, who had everything that was supposed
   to lift them up. Of course there were then, as now, bad men among the
   poor, but the proportion seems to have been greater among the rich.
   Here is Micah in the age-long trinity of evil; the idle rich, the
   unworthy ruler, the false prophet, and the worst of these is the false
   prophet, for he winked at their vices and justified the wicked with a
   reward. More and more, men are coming to realize the social value of
   the gospel. In spite of injustices and wrongs, the teachings and power
   of Christ are bringing in a better social order. God helps us to be
   brothers by making us His sons. The gospel is the real hope of the
   world, Luke 4:18.

  Great Fact II. Salvation in Messianic Times.

   Micah 3; Micah 4; Micah 5.

   Micah was no mere prophet of judgement and of gloom. His heart was full
   of hop and his voice full of song. He looked be yond the discipline
   that would coin through failure to the day when royal power shall again
   be seated in Jerusalem. Christ Himself shall reign there in the midst
   of universal peace, nations will flock unto it to learn piety and true
   religion, His kingdom shall extend to the ends of the earth, every man
   shall sit under his vine and fig tree and none shall make him afraid.

   Micah assures us:--
    1. Of the future establishment of Christ's kingdom with Jerusalem as
       its capital, Micah 4:1
    2. That the future kingdom will be universal, Micah 4:2.
    3. That lasting peace shall prevail, Micah 4:3.
    4. That peace shall lead to general prosperity, Micah 4:4.

   The picture of triumph, righteousness and peace is followed by a
   distinct promise of restoration from exile, Micah 4:6, although Micah
   does not disguise the fact that the Babylonian captivity will be a
   period of anguish. His great prophecy as to where the Christ-child
   shall be born, Micah 6:2, was accepted as final by the Jews.

   LESSON--Micah describes the ideal conditions that will exist in an
   ideal world, in the ideal age of Christ's reign. As the centre of all
   peace, freedom and love, he places the religion of the Lord, for "He
   will teach us His ways and we will walk in His paths," Micah 4:2. Let
   us look for and hasten the coming of the Lord, and the beginning of His
   glorious reign on the earth, by praying and working for the salvation
   of individual souls through the gospel. Just as the enemy wrongly
   occupied Belgium, but one day was completely expelled, so shall the god
   of this world be dethroned, and Christ shall. be acknowledged by all to
   be Lord of Lords and King of Kings.

  Great Fact III. God's Controversy with Israel.

   Micah 6; Micah 7.

   In his part God is represented as holding a controversy or law-suit
   with his people. He recounts how He was good to them and how He kept
   His covenant with them. The conscious-stricken people have to plead
   guilty to the charge of continual backsliding, and the prophet
   identifying himself with the people, repents of the sins which have
   occasioned the punishment, looks patiently to God, Puts his sole trust
   in Him, and in answer to his prayers is rewarded by the promise of
   deliverance.

   Micah contains many special predictions, which summed up are as
   follows:--
    1. The destruction of Samaria, Micah 1:6.
    2. The invasion of Judah, Micah 1:9.
    3. The overthrow of Jerusalem and the temple, Micah 3:12.
    4. The deportation to Babylon, Micah 4:13.
    5. The return from exile, the supremacy of Israel, and her peace and
       happiness under the Messiah, Micah 4:1-8.
    6. Christ should be born at Bethlehem Micah 5:2. This prophecy was so
       unmistakable that the Wise Men were guided by it.
    7. The kingdom that Christ shall set up shall be world-wide, peaceful
       and prosperous, Micah 4:1-5.

   LESSON--While Micah paints a charming picture of future blessings, he
   also insists that the people must have a change of heart, and as
   evidence of this change they must "do justly, love mercy, and walk
   humbly with their God." Micah 6:8 is an especially priceless message,
   and has been called the greatest verse of the Old Testament. If men
   would "do justly," they must be conscientious in business, not untrue
   or unfair in criticism, ever seeking to carry out the Golden Rule.

   Mercy and justice, joined together, are the qualities that make men
   God-like Mercy is nobility's true badge. It radiate a spirit of sweet
   kindness about the sinful, the suffering and needy. It makes smooth and
   glad the path through life.

   The third demand is the highest, for it requires us to be real friends
   of God, to have close personal fellowship with Him, to walk the fields
   of truth, climb the heights of the promises, and soar the watchtowers
   of prophecy with Him. To walk with Him so often that we get to walk
   like Him. Thrice blessed is the man who has learned to "walk humbly
   with his God!"

Lesson Them:--NAHUM

   Nahum 1:1-8.
     * KEY WORD--"NINEVEH."
     * KEY VERSE--Nahum 1:3, First Clause
     * KEY PHRASE--"GOD DEALING WITH THE SIN'S OF NINEVEH."

   Home Readings.

   Read this lesson and then the whole of Nahum as follows:
     * Sunday--The Majesty of Jehovah,--Nahum 1:1-8.
     * Monday--The Yoke of Nineveh Shall Be Broken,--Nahum 1:9-15.
     * Tuesday--Approach of Enemy to Destroy Nineveh,--Nahum 2:1-10.
     * Wednesday--The Nation Shall Fall Because God is against it,--Nahum
       2:11-13.
     * Thursday---Sins of the City Charged to it,--Nahum 3:1-7.
     * Friday--Like Judgements Brought Upon Other Places,--Nahum 3:8-1.
     * Saturday--Break Down of Things Depended Upon,--Nahum 3:12-19.

   WRITER--The name Nahum means "consolation," and indeed he did console
   Israel with the promise of their own deliverance and the destruction of
   their enemies. He was born at Elkosh, a small town in the province of
   Galilee. He most likely prophesied about 640 B. C., in the reign of
   Josiah, king of Judah. He saw the Assyrians threatening Judah, but saw
   also that they would he overcome and destroyed.

   PURPOSE--To foretell the destruction of Nineveh, the capital of
   Assyria. "which held sway for centuries, and has been regarded as the
   most brutal of the ancient heathen nations."

   NOTE ON ASSYRIA--Assyria and Babylon were two great empires that grew
   up on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, northeast of Palestine.
   Babylon first

   became an empire about 2280 B. C., and was by turn strong and weak
   until about 1100 B. C., when the Assyrian empire arose, overpowering
   Babylon. The Assyrian empire lasted until 625 B. C., having taken the
   Ten Tribes captive about one hundred years before it fell. In 625 B. C.
   Babylon again rose to power, and it was they who took Judah, the
   southern kingdom, captive about 588 B. C.

   The Assyrians boasted of unheard-of savagery. They flayed captive kings
   alive and dressed columns with their skins; others they walled-up
   alive. They burnt boys and girls in the fire, put out eyes, cut off
   hands, feet, noses and ears. All this they professed to do at the
   commands of their god, Asshur. No wonder Nahum indignantly and
   gratefully prophesies the end of Nineveh, the capitol of the wicked
   empire. The city was destroyed nearly a century later, exactly as he
   predicted. They had thought themselves absolutely safe in their capital
   with its 1,200 towers, and their wall a hundred feet high and so broad
   that three chariots could drive on it abreast. But they were swept
   away, as this book declares they would be, and the nations shouted for
   joy.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. The Decree.
    2. Attack.
    3. Cause.

  Great Fact I. The Decree of Nineveh's Fail.

   Nahum 1.

   The prophet begins by laying down the principle that God, although slow
   to anger, must avenge all crimes. His power is seen in the storm and
   the earthquake, Nahum 1:1-6. The principle is next applied to Nineveh.
   God is a refuge to His faithful one, but He will destroy Nineveh with a
   sweeping flood. Although its drunken armies get together in close
   formation as corn-pact as a hedge of thorn, yet this will not save
   them, Nahum 1:6-12. Judah is promised deliverance from the yoke of
   Nineveh, and is pictured as rejoicing at the news of its ruin, and
   celebrating her feasts in safety, Nahum 1:12-15. As a matter of fact
   the immediate fall of Nineveh was caused by a great flood from the
   River Tigris.

   LESSON--Nineveh stands for those nations that turn back from following
   God. About 150 years before this time, the city had repented under the
   preaching of Jonah. Now it has turned from the true and living God to
   serve idols. Those who were converted under Jonah were eternally saved,
   but a new generation has arisen who "Changed the glory of the
   incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
   beasts," Romans 1:23. The chief god of Nineveh was the bull god, with
   the face of a man, and the wings of a bird. Because of this national
   falling away from the religion of Jehovah, Nahum does not call them
   again to repentance, but threatens certain judgement. Antagonism to God
   can end only in disaster. A dying atheist appeared unhappy and
   frightened. Another atheist who stood at his bedside said to him,
   "Don't be afraid, hold on, man; hold on to the last." The dying man
   replied: "That is what I want to do, but tell me what to hold on to!"

  Great Fact II. Attack Upon Nineveh.

   Nahum 2.

   This chapter tells us very vividly of the siege and sack of the city.
   Outside the walls are gathered the Medes; their shields are brightly
   painted; their robes are of purple. Their terrible spears, and the
   knives on their chariot wheels glitter in the sunlight. Inside the city
   all is excitement as the /king tries to rally his drunken nobles to its
   defence, but it is too late. The flood, together with their enemies is
   upon them. Huzzab, the queen, is taken captive, while her maidens, like
   a flock of doves moan around her. The Median soldiers cry one to
   another, "Rob Ye silver, rob ye gold, for there is no end of the
   precious treasures!" So the city is plundered while the knees of the
   people of the city smite together for fear. Nineveh shall terrify the
   nations no longer because God is against her.

   LESSON--We often wonder why wicked nations are allowed to exist so
   long. The answer is found in 2 Peter 3:9. However, at the right time
   God will balance all accounts and render justice to all. So thorough
   was the destruction of Nineveh, that in 401 B. C., when Xenophon and
   his ten thousand passed over it, they knew not where they were, and
   when Napoleon encamped near its site he was not aware of it. So will
   all wicked nations be destroyed.

   It is also a remarkable fact that Nineveh was destroyed by a people as
   wicked as themselves--the Medes and Babylonians. Thus God uses wicked
   men to punish wicked men, as in the Pit, fiends are the tormentors of
   fiends. If men will not knowingly further God's holy purposes, then He
   will lead them to do so unknowingly!

  Great Fact III. The Cause of Nineveh's Fall.

   Nahum 3.

   As Nineveh sowed, so must she reap. She deserved her doom because of
   her cruelties, immorality, idolatry and greed. So she shall be stripped
   and scorned, and those who see her shall fly from her, astonished at
   her desolation, Nahum 3:2-7. Why should Nineveh expect a better fate
   than other nations who were likewise destroyed for their sins?Nahum
   3:8-11. All its efforts and resources cannot stave off its just
   punishment, Nahum 3:12-19.

   LESSON--In Matthew 26:24 and Luke 6:24-26, Christ utters as great woes
   upon the nations in general as is here uttered against Nineveh, and the
   wicked can no more escape them than did this city escape. The resources
   of civilization are powerless against Heaven's artillery. As we are no
   better than some who have already fallen, let us keep in holy fear of
   the judgements of God.

   "Will my case be called today?" said an eager client to his lawyer.
   "Are you sure that nothing is left undone? If judgement is given
   against me, I am a ruined man." This set the lawyer earnestly thinking,
   "What if my case were to come on today, before the Eternal Judge, whose
   sentence there is no reversing! Am I prepared?"

   WRITER--Habakkuk was probably a Levite and connected with the music. of
   the temple. He prophesied in Judah in the reign of Josiah about 608 B.
   C.

   TIMES OF THE PROPHET--The world-empire of Assyria had fallen 607 B. C.
   as prophesied by Nahum. Egypt and Babylon then fought to see who should
   be the master of the earth. At the battle of Carchemish, 605 B. C., the
   Babylonians were conquerors, and under Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon a n d
   Chaldees became one kingdom, so that their names became synonymous, and
   either meant the same kingdom. Habakkuk realized that Judah must fall
   before the rising Chaldean power but that one evil nation should put
   down another troubled him. That looked like evil triumphing over evil
   and no advance in righteousness.

   PURPOSE--To discuss the problem of why the wicked prosper, and to
   vindicate the righteousness of God.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Problem.
    2. Answer.
    3. Prayer.

  Great Fact I. Problem of Why Is Evil Unchecked?

   Habakkuk 1.

   Earlier prophets had pointed to the crimes and idolatry of God's people
   as the cause of their catastrophes, but Habakkuk was living after the
   great reformation days of the good king Josiah, who bad destroyed the
   idols, restored the Passover, and brought Judah back into the covenant
   relationship with Jehovah. It was therefore a great mystery to the
   prophet as to why the chosen people of God, the only nation that did
   not worship carved images and vain gods, the heirs of divine promise
   that they among all the nations should be threatened by calamities.
   Habakkuk could understand why the Ten Tribes bad been carried off, for
   they had constantly violated God's law, and given themselves over to
   Baal worship, but Judah had repented of her sins with fasting, weeping
   and vows of obedience. Yet, the Chaldeans, a wicked heathen nation,
   were preparing to swoop down upon them with the fierceness of a wild
   beast, and the prophet could see no prospect of deliverance.

   LESSON--The prosperity of the wicked was a great problem to the Jews,
   who believed so strongly in temporal punishment and rewards. Job,
   David, Solomon and the prophets often wrestled with the problem.
   Spiritually-minded Christians realize quit often outward prosperity is
   not real prosperity. That there is a curse wrapped, up in the wicked
   man's mercies, and a blessing concealed in the righteous man's crosses.

   It is true that the wicked attain their objects and seem to enjoy their
   prosperity, but the believer looks forward to the day when everything
   will be set right, and he never loses faith in the justice of God. We
   cannot judge a building while the scaffolding is up, neither can we
   fully measure God's dealings in the days of our limited vision. An
   insect, slowing crawling up a column of the White House, could as well
   judge the perfection of its architecture as we the wisdom of God's
   plan.

   Men do not live great and good lives because of their much ease or many
   pleasures, but because they nobly work, and lift and fight and dare!
   The heroes, someone has declared, are those who can stand the world as
   it is! The best men of all times are those who have made the most,
   sacrifice!

   Livingston, the great missionary who suffered such terrible hardships
   in darkest Africa, said: "I do not call my privations sacrifices,' for
   I think the word ought never to be applied to anything we can do for
   Him who came down from Heaven and died for us."

  Great Fact II. Jehovah's Answer.

   Habakkuk 2.

   The prophet ascends his watchtower to listen to God's answer to the
   problem. God points out that the Chaldeans are cull of pride and that
   they are living by robbery and wrong. In their injustice lie the germs
   of their future destruction, although it may be long delayed. On the
   other hand for the righteous there is preservation from evil; and
   salvation, provided they based their hopes upon faith.

   LESSON--Habakkuk was a prophet of a tried but triumphant faith. He
   draws for us a contrast between the unjust and the just man. He
   pictures the unjust Chaldeans as puffed up with pride and full of
   drunkenness, boasting, ambition and oppression, and rejected of God
   because not justified. As pride is the cause of much wickedness, so
   faith is the root of all moral and spiritual excellence in the soul of
   the just man. As pride leads to disobedience, as in the case of Eve, so
   faith leads to obedience, as in the case of Abraham.

   We must live by faith and not by sight or by sense. These are like two
   buckets, the lower sense goes, the higher faith goes. Luther says: "If
   you would believe, You must crucify that question, why?" God would not
   have us so full of wherefores. If we would live by faith we must be
   willing to walk in the dark with God, rather than to walk alone in the
   light.

  Great Fact III. Habakkuk's Prayer.

   Habakkuk 3.

   The prophet having heard the answer of Jehovah, and being still in
   fear, pours out his troubled soul in prayer, Habakkuk 3:1-2. The prayer
   is scarcely uttered before the congregation's hymn of praise rings out.
   It describes the glorious way in which He Put their various enemies
   aside, and how all nature bowed before His Majesty, Habakkuk 3:3-15.
   The fact that the Chaldean is at hand still fills the prophet with
   trembling, yet he is blessed with the hope of salvation, and rejoices
   in the Lord.

   LESSON--The prophet's prayer was a model one, for it recounted God's
   goodness in the past, and sought blessings and mercies for the hour. It
   was full of adoration, petition, loving appreciation of God's works and
   joyous trust. Webster regarded Habakkuk 3:17-18; as one of the
   sublimest, passages of inspired literature.

   The power of prayer may be increased in our lives if;
    1. We ever remember the importance of it, in that God will be inquired
       of for the blessings He is willing to bestow. If we would receive,
       the condition is that we ASK. We should do this in secret, family
       and public prayer.
    2. We must put away all doubts as to the reality of divine answers to
       prayers.
    3. We must feel that we cannot get along without God, or we will not
       pray. Self-sufficiency is atheistic. All true prayer is the cry of
       conscious weakness, "Save, Lord, or I perish."
    4. Holiness is essential to a life of prayer, as is also love. Prayer
       is the measure of love. He who loves much will pray much. A beggar
       hates to bother your door often, but a son bounds in with
       confidence whenever in need. It is only when we forget that we are
       "sons of God and joint-heirs of Jesus Christ" that we knock feebly
       at mercy's door!

LESSON THEME:--ZEPHANIAH

   Zephaniah 2:1-3.
     * KEY WORD--"REMNANT."
     * KEY VERSE--Zephaniah 2 :3.
     * KEY PHRASE--"A REMNANT HID FROM THE WRATH OF GOD."

   Home Readings.

   Read the lesson and then the book of Zephaniah as follows:--
     * Sunday--A sweeping threat,--Zephaniah 1:1-6.
     * Monday--Judgement upon irreligious and worldly,--Zephaniah 1:7-14.
     * Tuesday--Seek ye the Lord,--Zephaniah 2:1-3.
     * Wednesday--Punishment of various nations,--Zephaniah 2:9-15.
     * Thursday--The moral state of Jerusalem,--Zephaniah 3:1-7.
     * Friday--The Lord will deal with the nations,--Zephaniah 3:8-13.
     * Saturday--Future blessings and honours for Israel,--Zephaniah
       3:14-20.

   WRITER--The prophet was a grandson of King Hezekiah of Judah, and his
   name means "Hid of the Lord."

   TIMES OF THE PROPHET--He prophesied about 630 B. C. in the reign of the
   young and good King Josiah. Two wicked and idol-worshipping kings had
   preceded Josiah on the throne, so that the land was full of evil
   practices. Social injustice and moral corruption were widespread. The
   rich heaped up fortunes and indulged in luxuries by grinding down the
   poor. The religious situation also was as bad as it could be. To remedy
   this, Josiah, when but sixteen years of age, undertook to promote a
   religious revival, and became one of the best and most-loved kings.
   Under the counsel and help of the prophet, Josiah took an active part
   in the great reforms. Taking a hatchet and pick-axe he personally broke
   down altars and images. How encouraging to the reformers must have been
   the words of Zephaniah in the key verse.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To show that a faithful remnant (remaining few) should be delivered
       from captivity.
    2. To show that the heathen shall be converted.
    3. To show that instead of men having to worship God at Jerusalem,
       they might do so anywhere, Zephaniah 2:11, which is confirmed in
       John 4:21.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Judah.
    2. Heathen.
    3. Remnant.

  Great Fact I. Judah Denounced.

   Zephaniah 1; Zephaniah 2; Zephaniah 3.

   After a sweeping threat in the first verse, the prophet then denounces
   three classes of false worshippers of Judah.
    1. The black-robed unlawful priests of Baal, together with the
       unworthy priests of Jehovah, and those who worship the stars from
       the housetops. Zephaniah 1:4-5.
    2. Those who so waver that at one time they swear by the Lord, and at
       other times swear by the god Moloch. Zephaniah 1:5.
    3. Those who turn backward from outwardly following the Lord, and now
       despise Him. Zephaniah 1:6.

   Upon all these shall come a series of punishments "in the Day of the
   Lord." This phrase is an important one and is often used in prophecy.
   The word "day" in Scripture is used exactly as we use it today. When we
   use a numeral in front of the word, and speak of 3 days or 40 days we
   always mean 3 or 40 literal days of 24 hours each. It is so with
   Scripture, and for this reason we are confident that the days of
   Creation were literal days. On the other hand, both Scripture, and we
   ourselves, use the word "day" in another sense. We speak of
   Washington's day or Luther's day, meaning in the time of Washington or
   of Luther. So when the Scripture speaks of the "Day of the Lord" it
   means "the time of the Lord's special working." This day of the Lord
   for the Jews of Zephaniah's time was the Lord's special working in
   events and punishments of the captivity. The future Day of the Lord is
   the period of the Great Tribulation and the Millennium, Revelation
   6:1-17.

   LESSON--We learn that it is not possible to serve two masters, as many
   of Judah were trying to do at the same time. Christ teaches this in
   Matthew 6:24. God says "Defraud not, never lie, be honest and just in
   thy dealings." Satan says, "Cheat your own father if you can gain by
   it." God says, "Keep holy the Sabbath Day." Satan says, Make it a day
   of worldly pleasure." No one has success or joy trying to serve two
   masters. The secret of happiness is wholeheartedness. Therefore Joshua
   24:15.

   We learn also the certainty of coming judgement. A. king of Hungary had
   a brother who would never think of this. It was a custom of that
   country that if an executioner sounded a trumpet before any man's door
   he was presently led to execution. The king, in the dead hour of the
   night sent the executioner to sound the trumpet before his brother's
   door, who, hearing it was greatly alarmed and at once tried to make
   peace with his brother. "Brother," said the king, "if a summons to
   judgement from an earthly king causes you so much fear, how much more
   the trumpet of the last day, therefore prepare to meet thy God.' "

  Great Fact II. Heathen. Nations Denounced.

   Zephaniah 2:4-15.

   Five heathen nations, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, Ethiopia and Assyria,
   shall be visited with wrath for their scorn and pride towards the
   Lord's people. Their idols shall be broken up, and the heathen shall
   worship God, everyone in his own country. Instead of all men making
   pilgrimage to Jerusalem, they may worship God anywhere.

   LESSON--The Jews taught that Jerusalem alone was the place of worship
   and the Samaritans that Gerizim should be the religious centre, but the
   prophet saw that spiritual worship did not depend upon so-called holy
   places. Since this time scores of places, like Rome and Mecca, have
   been set aside as holy, and men have superstitiously undergone every
   hardship in order to worship at these shrines.

   The sacredness of worship, however, depends not on the place, but on
   the divine Presence that comes in response to prayer. Men are to lift
   holy lands in prayer in every place from the rising to the setting of
   the sun, Malachi 1-11. If God's people shall meet with humble and
   devout souls, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. then no matter
   the place, it will be "none other than the House of God and the gate of
   heaven."

   Jesus, where'er thy people meet, there they behold thy mercy-seat.
   Where'er the seek thee thou art found and every spot dedicated,
   ground!"

  Great Fact III. A Remnant Shall Be Blessed and Honoured.

   Zephaniah 3.

   A faithful few will be delivered, and must wait with patience until the
   judgement of the wicked nations is overpast. Then the remnant shall
   call upon Jehovah with pure lips and a pure heart and shall be
   accepted. Then the prophet speaks in glowing language of the safety and
   glory of the purged and purified people of Zion.

   LESSON-The blessings of the remnant would depend, as with us, upon them
   being spiritual.
    1. They should be humble in spirit.
    2. Upright in conduct.
    3. Depending upon God.

   This would result in them being:
    1. Cleansed from shame.
    2. Delivered from spiritual pride.
    3. Redeemed from proud oppressors.
    4. Specially protected by God.

   Tell the sailor he shall have no more storms at sea. Tell the labouring
   man he shall have no more financial worries. Tell the farmer he shall
   have no more had crops, and he would have some idea of the joy that
   must have filled the hearts of the

   Jews when the prophet predicted that a time was coming when evil should
   exist no more among them. This prophecy shall yet be blessedly
   fulfilled in the Kingdom age.

         Lesson No. 35--Make the Bible Itself the Object of Your Study.

Lesson Them:--HAGGAI

   Haggai 2:4-9.
     * KEY WORD--"REBUILD."
     * KEY VERSE--Haggai 1:8.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE LORD'S HOUSE COMES BEFORE MEN'S HOUSES."

   Home Readings.
     * Sunday--Arise and build,--Ezra 1:1-11.
     * Monday--The prophet urges on the work, Ezra 5:1-6.
     * Tuesday--The governor and priest obey,--Haggai 1:12-15.
     * Wednesday--The House shall be glorious,--Haggai 2:1-19.
     * Thursday--Disobedience caused delay,--Haggai 2:10-19.
     * Friday--Kingdoms of this world to be overthrown,--Haggai 2:20-23.
     * Saturday--Temple finished and dedicated,--Ezra 6:14-18.

   WRITER--Haggai was born in Babylon and was the first of the three
   prophets of the Restoration, the other two being Zechariah and Malachi.
   He was a prophet of great faith and was used of God to weaker the
   consciences and stir up the enthusiasm of the Jews to rebuild the
   temple. He appeared at a very critical time in the nation's history,
   and it was through the pressure of his faith and prayers and appeals
   that the great task was accomplished.

   DATES: 536 B. C. Return of exiles under Zerubbabel and Joshua.

   535 B. C. Jews attempt to rebuild temple, but are discouraged by
   opposition.

   520 B. C. Haggai and Zechariah urge the people to rebuild.

   516 B. C. Temple finished and dedicated.

   458 B. C. Ezra returns at head of 6,000 more exiles.

   445 B. C. Nehemiah returns as governor of Jerusalem and rebuilds city
   walls.

   TIMES OF THE PROPHET--When the Jews returned to their own land from the
   70 years exile in Babylon, they were eager to set up again the public
   worship of the sanctuary, so at once built the altar of Burnt Offering
   upon the old site. Plans were also made for the immediate rebuilding of
   the temple, and the foundation stone was laid. When, however, the
   jealous, half-caste, semi-pagan Samaritans were refused a part in the
   work, they induced the king of Persia to stop the work, and for 15
   years nothing was done. The Jews then lost heart, and thought only of
   good houses for themselves until Haggai and Zechariah stirred them up
   with fiery preaching.

   PURPOSE--To show that the building of the Lord's House should come
   before the building of fine homes by the people.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Call.
    2. Glory.
    3. Chastening.
    4. Victory.

  Great Fact I. Call to Rebuild the Temple.

   Haggai 1.

   Haggai's first discourse was delivered on September 1st, 520 B. C. In
   it he sternly reproaches the people for not rebuilding the temple, and
   warns them to consider their ways, for the delay is not due to a want
   of means, Haggai 1:4. He assures them that God is withholding crops
   from them because of their neglect, Haggai 1:10. The effect of his
   appeals was that 24 days later the chiefs and all the people began the
   good work, Haggai 1:14.

   LESSONS--
    1. Hard times are sometimes of God's sending, and that because of our
       indifference to our religious duties, and our self-interest. It is
       true that crop failures and trade depression are due to natural
       laws, yet the Almighty is behind these laws. Repentance and prayer
       are the best remedies for hard times.
    2. The building and upkeep of Christian sanctuaries is the urgent duty
       of the Lord's people everywhere. Without them vice and iniquity
       would abound. Worship would be a lost art. Men would forget not
       only to love God, but also to love their fellows.
    3. It is not commendable when the Lord's people allow their church
       building to be dilapidated, as to be unworthy of the great head of
       the church, because of poor location, miserable accommodations or
       scanty furnishings. It is a noble ambition to make the sanctuary as
       convenient and as beautiful as possible. 2 Samuel 7:2.

  Great Fact II. The Glory of the New Temple.

   Haggai 2:1-8.

   This address is one of encouragement to those who felt that the new
   temple would be much poorer than the one Solomon built, The prophet on
   the contrary assures them that the glory of the new House shall be much
   greater than Solomon's magnificent temple, for it shall not consist of
   riches and jewels as did the glory of the first house, but rather the
   presence of Christ, the desire of all nations shall fill this house
   with glory. This prophecy was fulfilled by the presentation of Jesus in
   the temple 5110 years later, by His teaching therein, by His expulsion
   of the traders, and by His miracles in its precincts. Whenever He
   entered the temple it was filled with the glory of the Lord.

   LESSON--There is but one thing necessary in order that the sanctuary
   may be filled with the glory of the Lord, and that is the realized
   presence of the divine Redeemer. Without His spiritual presence it
   matters not who occupies the pulpit, nor how exquisite the music.
   Except He shall meet each waiting soul and bestow His pardon, purity
   and love, there will be no hallowed worship, and no gate to heaven. The
   divine presence will enlighten our minds and fire our hearts, move our
   souls to the very depths, and rouse a great desire for holiness. In
   glowing fervour may the glory of the Lord ever come upon us.

  Great Fact III. Chastening Because of Neglect.

   Haggai 2:10-19.

   This third address was delivered three months after work on the temple
   had started. In it the prophet explains why the prayers of the people
   go unanswered. It is because they have put off so long the completing
   of the temple, everything they did was spoiled because of this guilt,
   therefore blasting mildew and hail had made the seasons unfruitful. On
   the other hand, if they would renew their zeal and press on with the
   great work, then the Lord will bless them, and the earth shall yield
   her increase.

   LESSON--Providence is God's care exercised everywhere. That He controls
   the outward successes and failures of men's lives is seen from Psalm
   75:7. That He is responsive to our prayers is seen from Matthew 6:33
   and Philippians 4:19. At this time the Jews had forgotten that the hand
   of God was in their affairs. He therefore took away the prosperity of
   their pocketbooks in order that they might get back prosperity for
   their souls. A godly man as he was going to take ship for France, broke
   his leg, and the ship he would have gone on was wrecked in a storm. By
   breaking a bone his life was saved. So the Lord many times breaks our
   bones, but it is in order to save our lives and souls forever.

  Great Fact IV. The Final Victory.

   Haggai 2:20-23.

   In this address the prophet tells of the establishing of Christ as the
   head of the nation and the representatives of t h e house of David,
   when God shall shake or judge the nations, Matthew 25:31-32. The
   promise contained special blessedness for Zerubbabel, who was the head
   of the house of David at that time. That he should be a signet meant
   that he should be most precious in the Lord's sight. No events in
   Zerubbabel's time satisfied this ire-diction which awaits fulfilment in
   the Messianic age.

   LESSON--When God destroyed His enemies. He will honour His servants,
   Revelation 20:6. There is a legend of 40 brave Christians soldiers who
   were called upon to give up Christ or be exposed on the ice of a lake
   on an extremely cold winter night. They said, "Let us ask God to send
   us forty to our reward together." The heroes encouraged one another to
   play the man until they fell benumbed into their last sleep. One,
   however, could not endure the suffering and sought relief of the fire.
   A soldier of the guard was so impressed with the faith of these martyrs
   that he immediately took the weak one's place, and they received a
   triumphant entrance into everlasting glory, singing, "Forty wrestlers
   we have entered the arena, let forty victors receive the prize!" Final
   victory ever perches upon the banner of faith.

   WRITER--Zechariah, like Haggai, with whom he laboured, was born in
   Babylon, and returned with the captives. He was likely both priest and
   prophet, and began to preach as a young matt. Uninspired records say
   that he died a martyr.

   DATE--520-518 B. C.

   PLACE--Jerusalem.

   TIMES OF THE PROPHET--The Jews back from exile had given up hope of
   rebuilding the temple, when under the preaching of Haggai, two months
   before that of Zechariah, a splendid start was made. It was left for
   Zechariah to bring the task to completion.

   PURPOSE--To assure those who had returned from captivity, that,
   although the Promises that their glory should be restored, had not been
   fulfilled, yet they would be in the Messianic age.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Visions.
    2. Obedience.
    3. Messiah.

  Great Fact I. Vision Intended to Encourage the People.

   Zechariah 1; Zechariah 2; Zechariah 3; Zechariah 4; Zechariah 5;
   Zechariah 6.

   After a call to the people to turn from their evil ways and hearken
   unto the Lord the prophet then tells of eight symbolical visions which
   he had, and which were intended to encourage the Jews in rebuilding the
   temple.
    1. The horsemen among the myrtle trees. Zechariah 1:7-17. This vision
       reveals Israel in dispersion, Jerusalem under foreign rule, but the
       nations apparently prosperous and at ease. The Lord points the
       people to a time when He shall yet comfort Zion.
    2. The four horns and four smiths, Zechariah 1:18-21. A horn is a
       symbol for a Gentile king so this is a vision of the four world
       empires: Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece and Rome, as in Daniel
       2:37-44. These nations oppressed Israel, but they shall be
       destroyed.
    3. The measuring line, Zechariah 2. This teaches that God will
       re-people, protect and dwell in Jerusalem as soon as the sacred
       house of worship has been built. The city itself shall expand until
       it becomes as great metropolis without walls, for the Lord shall be
       as a wall of fire round about it. The promise will be truly
       realized in the Kingdom age.
    4. Joshua, the High Priest and Satan. Joshua clothed in filthy
       garments and bearing the sins of both himself and the people. is
       accused by Satan, as was Job, but he, being a type of Christ, is
       cleansed, clothed and crowned.
    5. The golden candlesticks, Zechariah 4. With the candlesticks were
       seven lamps, and two olive trees were emptying their oil into them.
       Throughout the scriptures, oil is used to represent the Holy
       Spirit. The teaching is, that just as the oil "was not supplied by
       human hands," so it will "not be by might, nor by power, but by my
       Spirit," that the House shall be built and supplied with spiritual
       life.
    6. and 7. The flying roll and the woman in the ephah, or seven-gallon
       measure. This teaches that when the temple is rebuilt and God's law
       is taught, that wickedness in commerce, typified by a woman in a
       measure, shall be carried back to Babylon, the proper home of all
       that is wicked.

    1. Four war chariots. According to Zechariah 6:5 these are angels who
       have a mission of judgement. The future fulfilment of this as seen
       in Revelation 7:1-3 will be in the period of the Great Tribulation.

   These eight visions are followed by a symbolic act. Certain exiles had
   come from Babylon and brought with them gold and silver as gifts to the
   temple. The prophet is to take this gold and silver to make a crown for
   the High Priest Joshua, and show that he was a type of Christ who would
   be the spiritual king of the world and the glory of the temple.

   LESSON--Pilate fulfilled the words of 6:13 when he led Christ before
   the frenzied multitude and cried, "Behold the man." If the Jews had
   known their Bibles, they would have been struck with the fulfilment of
   scripture, and would have gladly and not rejected Christ. Then they
   pressed a crown of thorns upon His unresisting brow. But when again the
   cry shall go forth, "Behold the man!" there will be another and more
   glorious temple in Jerusalem, and the long exiled nation will bring its
   silver, its gold, and all its glory and lay it at the feet of their
   King. Let us pray with new meaning "Thy kingdom come!"

  Great Fact II. Obedience is Better than Fasting.

   Zechariah 7; Zechariah 8.

   In this section we have the prophet's answer to the committee which
   came from Bethel to ask if the national fasts should be kept. The Jews
   had been used to fasting on the anniversaries of four great events in
   their history:--
    1. Day when siege of Jerusalem had been begun.
    2. The day when Jerusalem was captured.
    3. The day when the temple was burned.
    4. The day when Gedaliah (the good governor of the poor Jews left in
       the land when the people were taken off to Babylon) was murdered.

   Zechariah's answer to the questions was four-fold:--
    1. Fasting affects only yourselves. God requires obedience, Zechariah
       7:4-7.
    2. Learn a lesson from your fathers, they fasted but forsook justice
       and mercy, and God punished them, Zechariah 7:8-14.
    3. The Lord has returned to Jerusalem, and it shall be a city of truth
       and holiness. Israel bad been a curse among nations, but they shall
       now be a blessing, Zechariah 8:1-7.
    4. Therefore their fasts shall be changed into cheerful feasts of joy
       and gladness, and many peoples shall seek the Lord in Jerusalem,
       Zechariah 8:18-23. This will be fulfilled in the day of Israel's
       glory, when the Jews converted and filled with Spirit, will be the
       means of the conversion of the nations.

   LESSON--Fasting is valuable only as an outward sign of repentance and
   confession of sin. Merely refraining from food will not bring the
   blessing. Along with It must be a humble and contrite heart. Any
   observance, however, is good that gives us room to deny ourselves and
   provides a path to bring us daily nearer God.

  Great Fact III. The Messiah in Rejection but afterwards in Power.

   Zechariah 9; Zechariah 10; Zechariah 11; Zechariah 12; Zechariah 13;
   Zechariah 14.

   This section contains promises of a return from exile, a land in which
   to dwell, victory over hostile world powers, temporal blessings and
   national strength. In Zechariah 11; the prophet as a shepherd seeks to
   save Israel but is rejected, and sold for the price of a slave, thirty
   pieces of silver, foreshadowing that Christ should also be rejected and
   betrayed for such a sum. In the Zechariah 12; we have a prophecy of the
   siege of Jerusalem by the anti-Christ and his armies, in the last days.
   The repentance of the Jews, Zechariah 12:12, and the fountain opened to
   them, Zechariah 13:1. The Lord's return upon Mt. Olive, which shall be
   cleft asunder by an earthquake, Zechariah 14:4. The Lord shall be king
   over all the earth, and all things, and all people shall be holy unto
   the Lord, Zechariah 14:9-20.

   LESSON--The power of the world has shifted from many things, and will
   continue to shift until it is in the hands of Christ. The Jew proudly
   smiled and thought it all resided in the temple, The Greeks pointed to
   their learning and art and thought it the mightiest force in the world.
   The Romans said it rested in their splendid laws and armies. But the
   Jews, the Greeks and the Romans with all their ancient glories have
   gone down, and the once rejected and crucified Christ will yet reign in
   everlasting glory and power. A Scottish king said to his soldiers,
   "When you loose sight of your colours rally to my white plume. You will
   always find it on the way to victory!" Let us lift up again and again
   our hearts and hopes to the King of Glory!

     * Friday--A Message to Doubters,--Malachi 3:13-18.
     * Saturday--Elijah Will Come Again,--Malachi 4:1-6.

   WRITER--The prophet Malachi. His name means "My Messenger." He was the
   last of the Old Testament prophets.

   TIME--About 430-420 B. C., during the times of Ezra and Nehemiah.

   THE STATE OF THE TIMES--Malachi Prophesied after the Jews had returned
   from Babylon, when Judas was a Persian Province. As given in the book
   of Ezra, the temple had been rebuilt and its worship restored. Nehemiah
   had rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, as stated in the book of Nehemiah,
   and had returned to Babylon, according to the promise he had made the
   king. During his absence the people grew very discouraged and doubting
   because the Messiah had not come and set up His reign upon the earth,
   as foretold by the prophets. The people neglected the worship of the
   Lord, the priest became lax and degenerate, God's covenant was
   forgotten, tithes were unpaid, and divorce and other social evils
   became common.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To condemn the social evils of the day.
    2. To show that God is the moral ruler of the world, and that it would
       pay to serve Him.
    3. To foretell the coming of John the Baptist before Christ's first
       coming, and that of Elijah before Christ's second coming.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Reproof.
    2. Sins.
    3. Fore-runners.
    4. Tithes.
    5. Elijah.

  Great Fact I. Reproof of the Priests.

   Malachi 1:2-9.

   In a brief introductory message Malachi shows that the Lord's love for
   Israel was far greater than that of Edom. For Israel was disciplined
   only for a time, but Edom was forever punished. This is the difference
   in God's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.

   The priests are then reproved because they despised the table of the
   Lord, offered polluted bread upon His altar, and brought blind, sick
   and lame victims for sacrifice, which they would not dare to offer to
   an earthly ruler. Better no worship at all than that they should insult
   God with their selfishness. At the time that God's name was great among
   the heathen it was no time for it to be profaned by Jewish priests.

   If they did not lay the Lord's reproof to heart, He would send curse
   upon them. Indeed, they are already vile in the eyes of the people
   because of their bad influence.

   LESSON--The divine reproach is that the priests do not care how lightly
   and unworthily they lead in the worship of God. Their lack of faith and
   moral soundness showed also the spirit of their age. It is all too easy
   for us to follow the evil example of the Jews in bringing blind, lame
   and sick offerings. We do this when we bring:
    1. Cold, formal and half-hearted worship. "Blind is the sacrifice of
       the soul which is not illuminated by the light of Christ. Lame is
       his sacrifice of prayer who comes with a double mind to entreat the
       Lord." There is far too much Christianity without Christ and
       without heart in it. Some of the worst enemies of the cross of
       Christ keep all the forms of religion.
    2. When we offer to God anything less than our best. David nobly
       refused to offer unto God that which cost him nothing, 2 Samuel
       24:24. Indeed there is no heart to the religion of the man who is
       always trying to serve God cheaply. Christianity is not a thing of
       convenience, but of sacrifice. We should dedicate to God the best
       of our time, our influence, our talents and our means, and always
       feel that nothing is good enough or great enough for Him who spared
       not His own Son, Romans 8:32.

  Great Fact IL The Sins of the People Rebuked.

   Malachi 2:10-17.

   The prophet first denounces sins against brotherhood. He urges that God
   is the Father of the Jewish nation, and as the Jews sinned against each
   other they offended their common Father and broke the family covenant,
   Malachi 2:10. He next tells them that they are guilty of sins against
   God in family life, for women came weeping and wailing to the altar of
   Jehovah and covering it with tears because men obtained divorces on the
   flimsiest grounds and dealt treacherously with the wives of their
   youth, to marry heathen women. "No one," said the prophets, "who does
   this has even a remnant of the Spirit."

   LESSON--When we are untrue to God we injure our brethren. When we are
   careless about God's claims, we will hold lightly His standards of
   morality. On the other hand God expects us not only to aid a brother in
   distress, but help him to be a good Christian.

   The Africans have a beautiful custom they call the "Brother Rite." One
   man will open a vein over the heart of another, and rub the blood from
   it into his own wound; this is to signify that they are halves or part
   of each other. Henceforth when either is in trouble the other feels "It
   is myself that is in trouble," and thus does for the other what he
   would do for himself.

   Every Christian, because of his blood fellowship, should think of
   others as he would they should think of him. Talk of others as he would
   they should talk of him, and aid others as he himself would be aided.

  Great Facts III. A Forerunner Shall Come.

   Malachi 3:1-6.

   The prophet announces the appeasing of a forerunner of Christ, which
   was fulfilled in John the Baptist. He should go before the Lord in the
   Spirit and power of Elijah. Isaiah 40; Isaiah 41; Isaiah 42; Isaiah 43,
   and Matt. 3:3. He should not come unprophesied or unsent, even it to a
   careless generation he was unexpected. He should prepare the way of the
   Lord by taking away their confidence in their relation to Abraham,
   Matthew 3:9, by calling them to repentance, and by proclaiming that
   Christ was at hand, Matthew 3:2.

   LESSON--God in this way gave Jews a sign. For thirty-six hundred years
   He had been telling them that the Messiah should come and here he adds
   that a little while before Christ should appeal a great prophet would
   arise, and call to the everlasting gates of their hearts to lift up
   their heads and receive the King. It is one of the marvels of the ages,
   that after a prophetic silence of 400 years, that when John the Baptist
   did appear, his witness to Christ was not accepted.

  Great Facts IV. Tithes Unpaid.

   Malachi 3:7-18.

   Here the prophet tells the people that they have not only run away from
   the Master, but have runaway with the Master's goods. "Ye are gone away
   from my ordinances. Return unto me." "Ye have robbed me." They had
   brought some tithes but like Ananias and Sapphira, they had kept back
   part of the price. They had robbed Him from Whom all blessings come!
   Had robbed Him of themselves and their service, of Sabbath-time and the
   tithes which were for the spread of His religion. God therefore
   punished them through unseasonable weather or insects that ate up the
   fruits of the earth, and through short crops and famine. He also
   earnestly exhorts them to bring all the tithes into the storehouse,
   which was the temple, and then He would not only

   give an abundance of rain, but superabundance of Heavenly blessings, so
   that there should not be room enough to receive them.

   LESSON--Christians die spiritually and lack God's favour when they
   covetously withhold from God His dues. A robber cannot be happy! Some
   of the advantages of tithing are:--
    1. It is founded on scripture.
    2. The tither has the satisfaction of giving systematically.
    3. He generally has money on hand for the Lord's work.
    4. Appeals for funds never evoke from him the comment, "Too much talk
       about money in the church."
    5. Tithers almost without exception, are joyful Christians, informed
       on missions and benevolences, and delighting to help every good
       object.
    6. They inherit the great and exceedingly precious promises of God,
       both temporal and spiritual. Let every Christian earner dedicate
       one-tenth of his earnings to the Lord!

  Great Facts V. Return of Elijah.

   Malachi 4.

   It is very significant that in the last words of Malachi, and of the
   Old Testament, the people are called upon to remember the law of Moses,
   and to treasure the hope of the return of Elijah before the "great and
   dreadful day of the Lord." That this does not refer to the coming of
   John the Baptist in the spirit of Elijah as some think, but is seen in
   the fact that Christ's first coming was not a great and dreadful day,
   but a day of grace and of salvation. Neither did John the Baptist do
   the work set forth here of reconciling the hearts of the nation to one
   another. On the other hand, the second coming of the Lord will indeed
   be a great and dreadful day of judgement and of wrath, and as seen in
   Revelation 11:3-7, Elijah will be one of the witnesses who will prepare
   the way for the Lord's second coming, as John the Baptist did for the
   first.

   LESSON--In a day when men are falsely calling themselves Elijahs, we
   should remember that when the true Elijah comes, he will be a Jew, and
   that he will testify for the Lord, not in America or in Europe, as many
   have sought to do, but in Palestine, and that, after the churches have
   been caught up to meet their Lord, 1 Thessalonians 4-17.

   At the Passover feasts of the Jews, they still set a place for him at
   the table and leave the door wide open in case he should appear. Let us
   be such Christians, and live such lives, that if all Christians were
   like us, the world would be ready and watching for the King!

   "Unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with
   healing in His wings." A man scoffingly asked, "What advantage has a
   Christian over any one like myself? Does not the sun shine on me as on
   him, this fine day?" "Yes," replied the devout friend, "but the
   Christian has two suns shining on him at the same time--one on his body
   and the other on his soul!"

   Malachi is the last prophet of the Old Testament. Four centuries were
   to elapse before the next prophet, John the Baptist, should speak for
   God. He startled the world with the thrilling message that the Divine
   Son of God had become flesh, that we might behold His glory, the glory
   of the Only Begotten Son sent from the Father!

   Home Readings.

   The Old Testament is directly declared to be the Word of God. In it we
   get no less than 1,904 expressions like "Thus saith. the Lord," "God
   spoke," "God said." Read something of each period.

   NAME--The Old Testament is God's record of the creation of man; of His
   covenant to save him, and of the religious preparations He gave the
   world for the coming of Christ.

   BOOKS--There are 39 books in the Old Testament written by about 3.0
   inspired writers, from the book of Job, probably written by Moses 1520
   B. C., to the book Malachi, written about 420 B. C., a period of 1,100
   years. The 39 books comprise five of law, Gen. to Dent.; twelve of
   history, Joshua to Esther; five of poetry, Job to Song of Solomon;
   seventeen prophecies and sermons on the religious conditions of the
   times, Isaiah to Malachi.

   UNITY OF BOOKS--Dr. G. Campbell Morgan said, "It was out of a deep
   sense of perplexity that I turned from books about the Bible to the
   Bible itself. The result was a discovery of unity which to me is the
   final proof of its divinity. Beginning with the Old Testament and
   moving systematically forward I saw that each book demanded another,
   and that when Malachi was reached the whole collection demanded more.
   In other words, I found that step by step I had proceeded through
   history and through teaching, all of which pointed to a Coming One.
   Then turning to the New Testament, I found the answer to all
   expectations created in reading the Old!"

  Great Facts I. Creation to Flood, 4004-2349 B. C.--1,655 Years.

   Genesis 1; Genesis 2; Genesis 3; Genesis 4; Genesis 5; Genesis 6;
   Genesis 7; Genesis 8.
    1. Creation. God created the heavens and earth, and created a man in
       innocency. He placed him in perfect surroundings, subjected him to
       a simple test, having, first warned him against disobedience.
    2. Fall. Satan, acting through a serpent, caused man to doubt and
       disobey God. This led to his fall from innocency, and from
       communion with God, and to his expulsion from Eden.
    3. Covenant. God made a covenant with man to provide a Saviour from
       sin, and instituted sacrifices to teach that without the shedding
       of blood there could be no remission of sin.
    4. After 1,655 years, because of man's exceeding wickedness, God sent
       a flood upon all the earth, and destroyed all men except Noah and
       his family.

  Great Facts II. Re-peopling the Earth, 2349-1996 B. C., 353 Years.

   Genesis 9; Genesis 10; Genesis 11.

   Noah was the head of a new race, which at first failed to spread over
   the earth. God therefore confused the tongues of the people, and as
   each tribe spoke only its own language, it gave rise to the beginning
   of nations. Noah's son Japheth became the father of the Gentile race,
   Ham of the black, and Shem of the Israelitish and yellow races.

   The race having given itself over to idolatry. God called out Abraham
   to wit ness for Him and live a life of faith. By covenant and promise
   God bound Abraham and his seed to Himself. Abraham's faith is seen, in
   that he was willing to offer up his only son. Isaac is noted for being
   willing to fulfil his father's will Jacob had his name changed to
   Israel for his faith and power in prayer. Joseph when down in Egypt,
   became the saviour of all Abraham's children.

  Great Facts IV. Egyptian Bondage and the Exodus, 1635 -1490 B. C., 145 Years.

   Books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.

   After the death of Joseph in Egypt, a new king arose who oppressed the
   Israelites. God raised up Moses as a deliverer, and he, after bringing
   ten plagues upon Pharaoh for not letting Israel go, then set up the
   Passover feast, led the Israelites through the Red Sea and brought them
   to Mt. Sinai. Here God gave them the Moral Law in the Ten Commandments,
   and the Ceremonial Law in the Sacrifices and Feasts, and Civil Laws
   which were to be the basis of their social life. A tabernacle was set
   up and became the centre of worship for 400 years. A priesthood was
   established with Aaron as first High Priest. After 40 years of
   wandering in the wilderness Moses gave a Review of the Law as recorded
   in Deuteronomy, called Joshua to be his successor, and then fell asleep
   in the Everlasting Arms.

  Great Facts V. Conquest of Canaan and the Judges of Israel, 1490-1100 B. C.,
  390 Years.

   Books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth.

   Joshua led Israel dry-shod through the River Jordan, and after several
   battles, in divine might, overcame the tribes of the land, and divided
   it among the twelve tribes of Israel. Upon the death of Joshua, God
   raised up at different times 16 Judges to be their rulers and military
   leaders. This period has been called the Dark Ages of Israel because of
   their misfortunes through backsliding. At this time, Ruth, a woman of
   Moab, became an ancestress of the Messiah.

  Great Facts VI. The United Kingdom, 1100-977 B. C. 123 Years.

   Book of 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles.

   Upon the insistent appeal of the people, Samuel set up a monarchy, and
   appointed Saul to be king. Saul, David and Solomon were the kings of
   this period and each reigned about 40 years.

   This is the golden age of Israel's history, when the kingdom grew to
   its largest extent, when commercial relations were established with all
   parts of the world, when literature, science and art, including music,
   made a great advance. The schools of the prophets were set up by
   Samuel, and a glorious temple built by Solomon. The Psalms of David
   were a great blessing to this age.

  Great Facts VII. The Divided Kingdom, 977-587 B. C. 390 Years.

   Books of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles.

   Rehoboam threatened to make the burdens of the people heavier, so the
   ten northern tribes revolted and formed the kingdom of Israel, while
   the two southern tribes were known as the kingdom of Judah. Israel had
   19 kings from Jeroboam to Hosea, 977-724 B. C., and then because of
   their idolatry they were carried into captivity by Shalmanesser , king
   of Assyria, and never did return. The prophets of Israel were Elijah,
   Elisha, Jonah, Amos and Hosea.

   Judah was more loyal to God, and so kept its national life 136 years
   longer, yet it too frequently turned away from Jehovah, and it was
   taken away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, 558 B. C. The prophets of
   Judah were Isaiah, Jeremiah. Joel, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
   Zechariah.

  Great Facts VIII. The Babylon Captivity, 587-536 B. C., 51 Years.

   The seventy years captivity is counted from the time that the king of
   Babylon first captured Jerusalem, 606 B. C., and some, including
   Daniel, were carried away. It was 19 years later, however, that
   Jerusalem was destroyed, and their national life ceased. The temple,
   which had been their glory, was burned, and the people marched off to
   serve foreign masters. The prophets of the captivity were Daniel and
   Ezekiel.

  Great Facts IX. The Restoration, 536-391 B. C., 145 Years.

   Books of Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther.

   The Jews were in exile and Jerusalem was in ruins, but after the 70
   years of discipline were over, God influenced Cyrus, king of Persia, to
   allow the Jews to return, (The Persians had conquered and possessed
   Babylon.)

   Zerubbabel led 50,000 back and rebuilt the temple. Ezra returned with
   6,000, prevailed upon the Jews to put away their idolatrous wives,
   restored the Law, and edited and published the Old Testament. Thirteen
   years later when Nehemiah returned he built up the walls of Jerusalem
   which assured some security for national life again.

   The prophets of the period were Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.

   The Bible story and message is like a picture wrought out in mosaics;
   each great fact has an important place, and we cannot understand the
   chapters and verses unless we have a general knowledge of the Bible as
   a whole, therefore read this lesson as often as possible, and keep its
   nine great divisions clearly in mind.

   In the Old Testament God is teaching the people their letters, in the
   New Testament He is teaching them to put these letters together and
   arrange them as we will, they spell Christ and nothing but Christ!

GREAT PERIODS OF HISTORY:--

    1. Persian, 200 Years.
    2. Greek, 10 Years.
    3. Egyptian, 119 Years.
    4. Syrian, 41 Years.
    5. Jewish, 100 Years.
    6. Roman, 133 Years.

  Great Period I. Palestine a Persian Province, 536-333 B. C.

   The events of the book of Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther occurred in the
   first 100 years, and Judah remained a Persian province for about 100
   years after the close of the Old Testament history. While other Persian
   provinces were often in rebellion, the Jews kept loyal to the Persian
   King, and rapidly increased in wealth and number.

   An event of great interest was the building of the Samaritan Temple on
   Mt. Gerizim, and the setting up of rival Jehovah worship. It came about
   in this way: Manasseh, the brother of the Jewish High Priest married a
   daughter of Sanballat, the Persian governor of Samaria. This meant

   that he to give up his priesthood in Judah. He therefore set up in
   Samaria, but a few miles from Jerusalem, a rival temple, with Jehovah
   worship, and the Pentateuch as their Bible. This led to a strife
   between the Jews and the Samaritans, which existed In the time of our
   Lord, John 4:20.

   A second great event was the union of civil and religious powers, which
   gave the office of High Priest, and that of governor of Judah, to the
   same man. The (nee thus became an object of great ambition, and some
   disgraceful contests for it took place. Joshua, brother of the High
   Priest, endeavoured to secure the honour for himself, but was slain by
   Jonadad in the temple itself. For this scandalous act the Persians put
   a tax of 50 shekels or $33 on every lamb sacrificed in the temple. This
   was a great burden on the temple worship, and discouraged sacrifices as
   much as it the state were to put a tax of $3 on every dollar given to
   missions.

   LESSON--The union church and state is a great evil in any land. Here it
   led to the state claiming the right to appoint the High Priest, which
   would be equal to the governor of our state claiming the right to
   appoint whom he would as pastors of the churches. The office would
   become one of barter and sale. It also led to the state taxing the
   contributions of worship, and to the saturating of religion with
   politics.

  Great Period II. Palestine Under the Greek Empire, 333-323 B. C.

   Alexander the Great in a series of battles conquered the entire Persian
   empire, and became the master of the world. While besieging Tyre,
   Alexander sent word to the high priest at Jerusalem demanding that he
   should transfer his allegiance to him, and send supplies for his army.
   Jaddua, the high priest, declared he must remain faithful to the
   Persians. Alexander then marched upon Jerusalem to the great alarm of
   the Jews. Sacrifices were offered prayers made unto God, and divine aid
   sought to appease the wrath of the invader. The high priest, clad in
   the full regalia of priestly robes, then formed a procession of the
   priests and people. He marched at the head of it without a sword or
   spear, with nothing but the sacred scriptures. When the Greek conqueror
   saw the venerable form of the high priest, he fell prostrate and adored
   the Holy Name written in golden letters on his hat. Alexander took the
   high priest by the hand, entered the city and granted them many
   religious liberties, including the exemption of tribute every seventh
   or Sabbatic year, when the Jews planted no crops. Daniel 1:6 tells of
   the transition of empires from the Persian to the Grecian.

  Great Period III. Palestine Under the Kings of Egypt, 323-204 B. C.

   On the death of Alexander, in fulfilment of the prophecy of Daniel,
   Daniel 8:21-22, the empire was divided among four of his generals, and
   to Ptolemy I fell Egypt and Palestine. He treated the Jews with great
   harshness at first, sending some of them to Egypt. His son, Ptolemy II,
   is famous for founding the great library at Alexandria, Egypt, which
   has a magnificent collection of the writings of all nations.

   Under his patronage the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek
   and the famous vision is called the Septuagint--a word meaning
   "seventy" because 70 elders were sent from Jerusalem to Alexandria to
   do the translating. Greek had become the language of the world, and
   this was fortunate for the Bible writers, and indeed for us, for no
   other language has ever equalled it in expressing delicate shades of
   thought. The world now had the holy scripture in a language that almost
   every nation under the heaven could read. The translation was one of
   the memorable events of all time.

   Ptolemy IV outraged the religious feelings of the Jews by entering the
   Holy of Holies of the temple. He was seized, however, with a
   supernatural terror and carried out half dead. In revenge for this he
   oppressed the Jews in a scandalous manner. When his son came to the
   throne, he was but a child of five years, so the king of Syria took the
   opportunity of snatching Palestine away from Egypt.

  Great Period IV. Palestine Under Syria, 204-163 B. C.

   Antiochus III of Syria, having been badly defeated by the Romans,
   resolved to plunder the temple at Jerusalem, to -get funds to help him
   pay the indemnity. His treasurer, however, was struck speechless to the
   ground, as he was entering the sanctuary, and went back home in dismay.

   Antiochus Epiphanes now comes to the throne of Syria. As his name
   means, he was illustrious, but only for cruelty and wickedness. Read
   Daniel 8:9-14. He went to war with Egypt and was successful, but the
   Jews heard he had been killed, at which they showed signs of great joy.
   Hearing of this be went to Jerusalem to punish them. He captured the
   sacred city, slew 40,000 Jews and sold a like number as slaves. To show
   his contempt for the Jewish religion, he sacrificed a hog (very much
   hated by the Jews as an unclean animal) on the altar of burnt offering.
   and sprinkled broth made from its flesh all over the building. He later
   made a frightful massacre until the courts of the temple ran with
   blood, and also carried away many into slavery. He then made a decree
   forbidding the Jews to offer up sacrifices up to God, to obey God's
   laws, or to keep the Sabbath day. A statue of the heathen god Jupiter
   was erected in the temple, and Jewish sacrifices and public worship of
   God had to cease for three and one-half years. At length God raised up
   a deliverer in the noble Maccabee family.

  Great Period V. Jewish Independence Under Maccabees, 163-63 B. C.

   A priest named Mattathias and his Live sons gathered around them a
   number of faithful men to deliver God's people. The Syrians waged three
   campaigns against the patriots, but each time were unsuccessful. At
   length civil war broke out in Syria itself, and peace was concluded
   with the Jews, with Judas Maccabas as govern. or of Palestine. The
   motto of his banner was Exodus 15:11. The Jews then cleansed and
   rededicated the temple and public services were resumed. Judas being
   again at. tacked by the Syrians, applied to the Romans for help, but
   fell in battle before it came. His brother Jonathan succeeded him but
   being murdered, was followed by another brother, Simon. With the help
   of Rome he established the kingdom, and handed down the throne to his
   son, John Hyrcanus. At this time the Pharisees and Sadducees became
   strongly opposed to each other and caused a good deal of strife. A
   grandson of John sought to defend Jerusalem against the Romans under
   Pompey. 63 B. C., but after three months siege, the city was taken, the
   walls broken down, and a yearly tribute to Rome imposed.

  Great Period VI. Palestine Under the Romans, 63 B. C. to 70 A. D.

   The Romans were now the masters of Judea. They sent a general named
   Herod to be king, and to please the Jews he pretended to accept their
   religion. In reality he was a fierce and wicked man. Seeing that he was
   still hated, he decided to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem, in hope
   that this would make the Jews more willing to have him rule over them.
   The temple, which then stood on Mt. Moriah, was the one built by the
   Jews after they had returned with Zerubbabel from Babylon. It was
   nearly 500 years old, and was much broken and decayed. Herod took it
   down part at a time, and built it up again, with great stones of white
   marble, covered in places with silver and gold. Ten years were spent
   and ten thousand men were employed at the task before it was ready to
   be dedicated. A much longer time was spent in finishing the out-works,
   justifying the remarks of the Jews in John 2:20. When finished it was a
   magnificent temple, far superior to what it had ever been. It was
   destroyed, however, by Titus in 70 A. D., as our Lord prophesied in
   Matthew 24:1-2.

   The same Herod slaughtered the infants at Bethlehem, as told in Matthew
   2:6-18, in an effort to destroy Jesus, who was born king of the Jews.
   He died, however, an unhappy death as told in Acts 12:23, while
   Christ's kingdom has spread "where'er the sun doth its successive
   journeys run!"

   The last 70 years of the Roman period belong to New Testament history
   and will be considered later.

   LESSON--
    1. The subjection of the Jews is a fulfilment of prophecy. Jerusalem
       has been under the rule of the Gentiles since 588 B. C., when
       Nebuchadnezzar first destroyed the city. For over 2,500 years the
       Jews have been under the sovereignty of the others, but have always
       been longing for the coming of the Lord in glory when Jerusalem
       shall again be the glory of the whole earth.
    2. The Jews teach us to have unshaken faith and hope in the sure
       covenants of Jehovah.
    3. The subjection and dispersion of the Jews was brought about by
       their sins and rejection of Christ. They would not have Him for
       their Saviour. The most dangerous and most ungrateful thing is the
       rejection of Christ. When Ulysses returned with fond expectation to
       his home in Ithaca, his family did not recognize him. Even the wife
       of his bosom denied her husband, so changed was he by an absence of
       twenty years at the wars. Like Christ, he came unto his own, but
       his own received him not. The Saviour comes to us as He came to the
       Jews. What shall our answer be?

     * KEY WORD--"CHRIST."
     * KEY VERSE--John 20:31
     * KEY PHRASE--"A FOURFOLD PICTURE OF CHRIST."

   Home Readings.

   As the four gospels give many aspects of Christ, read a different

     * Friday--Jesus Christ the Sin-bearer,--Matthew 27:27-34.
     * Saturday--Jesus Christ the Lord over death,--Mark 16:1-8.

   NAME, NEW TESTAMENT. Means the "New Covenant" of grace which God made
   with man in Jesus Christ, in contrast with the Old Covenant of law
   given through Moses.

   LOGICAL ORDER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT:--
    1. In the Four Gospels the Divine Christ enters the world, and dies
       for the world after founding His church.
    2. In Acts, Christ is preached in the Power of the Holy Spirit, and
       the doors of the churches are thrown open to all believers.
    3. In the Epistles, life in Christ is revealed in all its fullness,
       and the doctrines, ordinances and practices of the churches are set
       forth.
    4. In Revelation, profound interest is shown by Christ in the
       spiritual state of the churches, and their glorious future as His
       bride as foretold.

   Each division of the New Testament has also a relation to the
   experiences of each individual Christian.
    1. In the Gospels, Christ comes to the Believer to redeem him.
    2. In Acts, Christ fills the Believer with spiritual power for
       service.
    3. In the Epistles, the believer has blessed and exalted communion
       with Christ.
    4. In Revelation the believer comes with the returning Lord, that he
       may reign with Rim, and share His eternal glory.

   NAME--GOSPEL. Means God's message of salvation through Jesus Christ,
   and when we speak of The Gospel according to Matthew we mean Matthew's
   story of salvation.

   WRITERS--The gospels were written by the men whose names they bear,
   Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

   ORDER OF THE GOSPELS--While some scholars think that Mark's gospel was
   written first, yet many others agree that they were written in the
   order that they stand, with Matthew as the Genesis of the New
   Testament, containing within itself the beginning of all New Testament
   truths.

   SYNOPTIC GOSPELS--The first three are called synoptic gospels, because
   they give the same general view of the life and teachings of Jesus, in
   contrast with the fourth gospel which deals especially with the
   divinity of Christ, and the deep spiritual meaning of gospel facts.

   PURPOSE--To give a picture of who Christ was, how He wrought, and what
   He taught, how He died to save us from our sin, and how He rose again
   for our justification.

   THE WORLD PREPARED FOR CHRISTIANITY--The gospel could never have spread
   with the speed it did, but for three important world-wide events.
    1. The conquest of the world by Alexander the Great, and the spread of
       the Greek language, which made it possible for the gospel to be
       preached in a language which was understood in every land.
    2. The rise of the Roman Empire, with its good laws, and
       well-organized government, which offered protection to those
       preaching the gospel.
    3. The scattering abroad of the Christians, through persecution in
       Palestine, which spread their influence over the known world, and
       made their meetings rallying places for those who longed for
       something better than paganism. We thus see how providence prepared
       the way for grace to triumph.

GREAT FACTS:--

   Christ as:--
    1. King.
    2. Servant.
    3. Man.
    4. God.

  Great Fact I. Christ as King of the Jews.

   In Matthew. Key Verse:--

   Matthew 2:2.

   The Old Testament assured the Jews again and again that a Messiah
   should come who would be the King of the Jews. They therefore looked
   forward with passionate longing and patriotism to the coming of that
   King in pomp and power. Matthew proves that Christ was truly that King.
    1. While Luke traces Christ's descent back to Adam to link Him up with
       man, Matthew traces it back only to David and Abraham to show His
       royal descent.
    2. Only Matthew records the visit of the Wise Men to the Christ-child,
       because these royal visitors with their royal gifts help to prove
       the royalty of Christ.
    3. The Sermon on the Mount is given fully only in Matthew, because it
       gives the divine constitution for the righteous government of the
       earth in the kingdom age, when its teachings will be literally
       carried out. On the other hand, the spiritual application of its
       teachings is for all ages and all men.
    4. A king speaks with authority, therefore, this gospel records how
       Jesus with kingly authority uttered woes against those who rejected
       His claim. Matthew 23:13-25.
    5. The Kingdom of Heaven is a key phrase in Matthew, and occurs 32
       times here, and nowhere else in the New Testament. It means the
       rule of the heavens over the earth, through the presence of the
       King.
    6. Christ was crucified for many reasons. In John the reason given is
       because He claimed to be the Son of God, in Matthew the reason
       given is because He claimed to be King of the Jews, Matthew 27:37.

   LESSON--With fervent loyalty we should yield our hearts, minds and
   wills to Heaven's glorious King. A young man wore a ring with three
   words engraved on it that he made the slogan of his life, "Make Jesus
   King!" What a noble ambition! Be it ours to be true-hearted,
   whole-hearted, faithful and loyal to the King, and to seek to extend
   His reign throughout the earth.

  Great Fact II. Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.

   In Mark. Key Verse:--

   Mark 10:45.

   After Matthew's picture of Christ's kingly majesty, Mark pictures His
   lowliness. and would have us see His simple garb, worn sandals, and
   unshorn hair, Mark 10:44.
    1. No line of descent is given in Mark as no one wants to know the
       family tree of a servant, but they do in the case of one claiming
       to be a king.
    2. He is never called Lord in Mark before the resurrection.
    3. The four parables of Mark are all parables of service.
    4. The word "Straightaway" occurs forty-one times in the book, showing
       this gospel to be a vivid picture of the earthly acts of Jesus.

   LESSON--Christ is our example in humility and service, Mark 10:45.
   Although He was God in the flesh, He was willing to live in humble
   circumstances to labour hard and to obey his inferiors. His wonderful
   life was made up of simple acts of love. We can best show our love of
   God by serving our fellow men. On the walls of a Sunday school was a
   picture of an ox standing between an altar and a plough, with the words
   underneath, "Ready for either!" The ox stood ready to be laid on the
   altar, or to be yoked to the plough, although the altar meant suffering
   and the plough meant service. So we should, like the Master, be ready
   for either. Our lives will be poor withered things, unless we serve our
   own generation faithfully for Christ's sake!

  Great Fact III. Christ as the Son of Man.

   In Luke. Key Verse:--

   Luke 19:10.
    1. In Luke, Christ's line of descent is traced back to Adam, the
       father of the human race, to connect Him up with the whole race,
       and not merely with the Jews.
    2. While Matthew referred 65 times to the law and the prophets, to
       show that Christ fulfilled the law, Luke omits all such references,
       and unfolds a full and free gospel, not for a certain race or class
       but for all men. Christ is the saviour of all mankind.
    3. In Luke, Christ's tender human sympathy is seen all through it. He
       is bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. He is touched with the
       feelings of our infirmities. He wept over Jerusalem, healed the
       wound caused by Peter in the Garden, Luke 22:51, and shows
       compassion to the thief on the cross, Luke 23:43.

   LESSON--Christ has tender sympathy for us in all our experiences,
   because as Man, He was tried by toil and temptation, hunger and pain,
   sorrow and death. Sometimes it seems hard to make even your doctor
   understand what the pain is like. Words do not seem to convey it, and
   after you have explained the best you can, you still feel that the
   suffering is not fully understood. But Jesus went through all our
   feelings, and fears and troubles, therefore He is able to succour all
   that are tempted, Hebrews 22:18.

  Great Fact IV. Christ as the Son of God.

   In John. Key Verse:--

   John 1:1.

   Matthew wrote for Jews, Mark for Romans, Luke for Greeks, but John for
   all Christians.
    1. In this gospel Christ's line of descent is traced to God. He is
       declared to have been in the beginning with God, and to be God the
       Son.
    2. Over thirty times in John there are statements by Christ in which
       He claims to be divine, 4:25-26.
    3. John taught that Christ was divine,
         1. Because He was a perfect teacher,
         2. He set a perfect example,
         3. He was a perfectly sinless man,
         4. All prophecies were fulfilled by Him,
         5. HE wrought the works of God in His miracles,
         6. He arose from the dead.

   All the gospels, give an account of Christ atoning death, resurrection,
   and of His commission to the churches to evangelize the world.

   LESSON--We shall not be saved b) obeying the Sermon on the Mount of the
   King of Jews as set forth in Matthew Nor by imitating the humility and
   service of Christ as set forth in Mark, nor b] trusting to the sympathy
   of Christ as set forth in Luke, but we may be saved by believing in
   Christ the Son of God, as set forth in John. Only the sacrifice of the
   divine Lamb can take away the sin of the world. A king made a law, the
   punishment for breaking which was to be the loss of both eyes. His son,
   the heir to the throne, was the first to break it. Here was the supreme
   test. How could the king be just and spare his son? First he bade the
   officer burn out with the hot iron his own right eye, and then that of
   his son. So the law was honoured and atonement made. Only through God
   the Son bearing our own sins in His body on the cross, can God's holy
   law be honoured, and the sinner saved.

    Lesson No. 41--Take Your Bible to Bible Class for Reading the Scripture.

LESSON THEME:--MATTHEW

   Matthew 2:1-6.
     * KEY WORD--"FULFILLED."
     * KEY VERSE--Matthew 2:2.
     * KEY PHRASE--"CHRIST FULFILS THE MESSIANIC PROPHECIES."

   Home Readings.

   Read the whole of Matthew, noting these oft repeated phrases, "That the
   saying might be fulfilled," "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
   For family altar read:--
     * Monday--Messiah-king enters upon His work,--Matthew 4:13-25.
     * Tuesday--Teaching about the kingdom,--Matthew 5:1-12.
     * Wednesday--Divine origin of the church,--Matthew 16:13-20.
     * Thursday--Discipline in the church,--Matthew 18:16-20.
     * Friday--Multitudes recognize the King,--Matthew 21:1-11.
     * Saturday--The King goes away and will return,--Matthew 26:14-30.

   WRITER--Matthew followed the much despised and hated profession of
   tax-collector, in Capernaum. When he heard the wonderful words and saw
   the wonderful works of Christ he rose up and followed Him. To celebrate
   the beginning of his discipleship he gave a feast to his friends that
   they, too, might sit at the feet of the Master and learn of Him. Christ
   changed his name from Levi, which meant "he who cleaves to the old
   ways," to Matthew, meaning "the gift of Jehovah." He was one of the
   twelve apostles, probably devoted his ministry to the Jews in
   Palestine, and wrote the gospel that bears his name about 60 A. D.

   PURPOSE--To show that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah promised in the
   Old Testament, and the King of the Jews.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Proof.
    2. Entrance.
    3. Teachings.
    4. Suffering.
    5. Triumph.

  Great Fact I. Proof that Jesus was the Messiah.

   Matthew 1; Matthew 2.
    1. The Jews looked for the Messiah to be of the seed of Abraham, and
       also to be of the royal line of David, therefore Matthew is very
       particular to bring out these two facts in giving Christ's line of
       descent, showing that Jesus was the Messiah by His human ancestry,
       Matthew 1:1-17.
    2. Matthew next proves Jesus was the Messiah by His divine origin for
       He was begotten not by a human father but by the Holy Spirit,
       Matthew 1:20.
    3. Matthew also proves that Jesus is the Messiah, because His early
       history fulfils to the letter the things spoken of Him by the
       prophets. He was born at Bethlehem, of the house of David, came out
       of Egypt, lived at Nazareth, etc.

  Great Fact II. Entrance of the Messiah Upon His Work.

   Matthew 3; Matthew 4.

   While Jesus is still living at Nazareth, John the Baptist, after a
   solitary life in the desert, suddenly appears to the Jews, and breaks
   the prophetic silence of 400 years. His startling message bid the
   people to lay aside indifference, hypocrisy and false doctrines and
   receive Christ as the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the
   world. Tidings of the revival travelled northward to the province of
   Galilee, and among the numbers who came to hear the heart-stirring
   preaching were five young men, who afterward became Christ's disciples,
   John, Andrew, Simon, Phillip and Nathanael. Before long another made
   the long journey from Nazareth to Bethany beyond Jordan to be baptized
   of John. When He offered Himself. John was amazed that the Messiah
   should seek baptism at his hands, but Jesus said, "It is fitting for us
   thus to satisfy every claim of religion." (20th Century New Testament
   translation). Christ was circumcised in order that He might fulfil the
   Law, and baptized in order to be an example to those under Grace, 1
   Peter 2:21.

   Before Christ could enter upon His public ministry, the Holy Spirit led
   Him into the wilderness for the Temptation experience, which was to
   strengthen His trust in God, and bring out the principle that He would
   take orders only and always from God. The first two temptations were a
   challenge to prove Himself the Son of God. The last was the
   presumptuous offer of the usurping prince of this world to give to
   Christ the Kingdoms of this world, if He would fall down and worship
   Satan. Each test is met with scripture quoted from Deuteronomy, the
   book of obedience. Matthew 8:3; 6:13-14. Satan, who so easily triumphed
   over Adam, retires from our Lord in utter defeat. If we compare
   Christ's experience with Eve's temptation in Genesis 3:1-5, we shall
   see that the same old tempter is ever trying to cast doubt upon God's
   goodness to men, and seeking to twist scriptures in order to deceive.

   Christ now begins His public ministry in the northern province of
   Galilee, and calls Andrew, Peter, James and John to be His disciples.
   Those who are called by Christ must separate themselves to Him, learn
   of Him as Teacher, and follow Him as Master.

  Great Fact III. Teachings and Miracles of the Messiah.

   Matthew 5; Matthew 6; Matthew 7; Matthew 8; Matthew 9; Matthew 10;
   Matthew 11; Matthew 12; Matthew 13; Matthew 14; Matthew 15; Matthew 16;
   Matthew 17; Matthew 18; Matthew 19; Matthew 20; Matthew 21; Matthew 22;
   Matthew 23; Matthew 24; Matthew 25.

   In the parables and sermons of Christ He set forth spiritual truths in
   an impressive form. The most famous of them all is the Sermon on the
   Mount delivered during the first year of His public ministry. In it
   Jesus lays down the principal laws of the kingdom. It begins not with
   commands but with blessings, and reveals the riches of poverty, the
   royalty of meekness, and the blessedness that shall come out of sorrow
   and persecution. He taught that He came not to abolish the Law, but to
   obey and fulfil it. In memorable words He urged:--
    1. The character is the secret of happiness. That men of purity,
       self-control, humility and loyalty shall inherit the earth.
    2. That everything we do is judged by whether it is done with right
       motives.
    3. That kindliness is binding upon all, even to doing good to our
       enemies.
    4. That because God is our Father we should be free from anxiety,
       sincere in prayer, charitable to the poor, and ever seeking to be
       perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.

   He warned those who heard His sayings and did them not, that they were
   like a foolish man who built his house upon a foundation of sand, and
   in the path of storms, bringing upon himself certain destruction.

   The miracles of our Lord proved beyond doubt that He had supreme
   command over nature, for He made the winds and the waves obey Him,
   multiplied a few loaves and fishes, made incurably sick bodies whole,
   and even gave life to the dead. His miracles were acts of love and
   parables of mercy, proving that He was Indeed the Saviour of the world.
   He opened blind eyes to show His power over spiritual blindness He fed
   hungry bodies to show that He alone can satisfy hungry hearts, He
   raised the dead to show that He can give spiritual life to those who
   are dead in trespasses and sins.

   The teachings and works of Christ should take hold of our very hearts,
   for they lead us to do everything that is good with the highest
   motives, and lead us of our own accord to hate sin.

  Great Fact IV. Sufferings of the Messiah.

   Matthew 26; Matthew 27.

   Although Jesus was believed in and followed by a large number of
   disciples, yet the opposition of the Jews was bitter and they
   determined to put Him to death. He therefore instituted the Lord's
   Supper as a memorial ordinance of His death, was betrayed by Judas in
   the Garden of Gethsemane, and tried before Annas, the ex-high priest,
   before Caiaphas, the high priest, before Pilate, the Roman governor of
   Judea, before Herod, governor of Galilee, and again before Pilate.

   On the grounds of blasphemy, and of claiming to be the King of the
   Jews, thus making Himself the enemy of the Roman empire, Jesus was
   delivered up by Pilate to be crucified on April 7th in the year 30 A.
   D.

   At 9 a. m. on Calvary's brow, in fulfilment of Psalm 22:18, the
   soldiers parted His garments among them for His under-cloak they cast
   lots, and there between two thieves He was nailed upon a cross of wood.
   At noon a miraculous darkness descended upon the land, followed by a
   great earthquake that rent the rocks and the mountains, and split in
   two the veil which separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place in
   the temple. This signified that it was now possible through the shed
   blood of Christ, for every believer to enter God's presence in prayer.
   At 3 p. m., after hanging on the cross for six hours, the Saviour died,
   not from physical suffering alone, but or a broken heart, crushed by
   the sins of the world. When in triumph He cried, "It is finished!" the
   debt of the world was paid, the types and symbolism of the Old Covenant
   were all fulfilled, every iota of the law was magnified, so that all
   who believe in Him shall have everlasting life!

  Great Fact V. The Resurrection Triumph of the Messiah.

   Matthew 28.

   The body of Jesus was in the tomb Bart of Friday, all of Saturday, and
   part of Sunday, but as a part of a day was counted a day by the Jews,
   Jesus had said, "After three days I will rise again!"

   Early Sunday morning the women found the tomb empty except for the
   angel who announced that Christ had risen from the dead, and we can
   well imagine the boundless joy of their hearts as they realized that
   the great stone no longer sealed their Master's doom and their own
   failure.

   There is no fact better proved in history than the resurrection of
   Christ, for twelve times he appeared to His disciples. Three times we
   are told that His disciples touched Him after He rose, Matthew 28:9;
   Luke 24:39; John 20:27; and twice we are told that He ate with them,
   Luke 24:42; John 21:12-13.

   Among the supreme benefits of Christ's resurrection are the following:
    1. It is a proof that Christ actually atoned for our sins. Romans 1:4.
    2. Believers share the resurrection life of Christ. Romans 6:4.
    3. It is the guarantee and pattern of believers' resurrection. As
       Christ arose and put on a spiritual body so shall we. As the
       caterpillar is changed into a beautiful butterfly, and the charcoal
       into a brilliant diamond, so we shall be changed into His glorious
       image.

LESSON THEME:--MARK

   Mark 10:35-45
     * KEY WORD--STRAIGHTWAY (Occurs 41 Times).
     * KEY VERSE--Mark 10:
     * KEY PHRASE--CHRIST IS OUR EXAMPLE IN SERVICE.

   Home Readings.

   Read the whole of Mark this week, noticing that it lays emphasis upon
   the works rather than the words of Jesus. The Key Word occurs 41 times.
   For the family altar read:
     * Sunday--The coming of the Servant,--Mark 1: 1-11.
     * Monday--The Testing of the Servants,--Mark 1:12-20.
     * Tuesday--The work of the Servant,--Mark 2:1-12.
     * Wednesday--The Transfiguration of the Servant, Mark 9:1-9.
     * Thursday--The rejection of the Servant,--Mark 15:24-37.
     * Friday--The sacrifice of the Servant,--Mark 16:9-19.
     * Saturday--The exaltation of the Servant,--Mark 6:9-19.

   WRITER--Mark was a man of means, and the cousin of Barnabas. Colossians
   4:10. He was converted under the preaching of Peter, and went with
   Barnabas and Paul on their first missionary journey. It is thought that
   the reason he turned back from the work (Acts 13:13) was because he
   objected to the offer of salvation to the Gentiles on condition of
   faith alone. Two years later Barnabas wanted to take Mark on the second
   missionary journey, but Paul would not hear of it, so Barnabas and Mark
   together went to Cyprus, Acts 15:39. Eleven years later Paul had
   forgiven Mark, called him his fellow-worker and said he was a comfort
   to him. He was one of the faithful few among the Jewish Christians who
   stood by Paul in Rome at this time. It was here likely that Mark wrote
   his gospel. Having been much with Peter also, 1 Peter 5:13, he wrote
   his gospel from facts supplied by, and from the viewpoint of Peter.
   Mark was not an apostle.

   DATE--About 65 A. D. Events cover a period of 37 years.

   PURPOSE--To present Jesus as the wonder-working Servant of Jehovah, and
   thus our Example in service.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Coming.
    2. Work.
    3. Rejection.
    4. Sacrifice.
    5. Exaltation.

  Great Fact I. The Coming of the Servant.

   Mark 1:1-18.

   Nothing said in Mark of Christ's line of descent, nor of His miraculous
   birth, nor of the visit of the Wise Men. He is seen here as the Servant
   going at once about His serving. The account of the ministry of John
   the Baptist is the briefest in Mark. John did a great work, and created
   a great stir, Mark 1:6. Jesus, having served during the silent years at
   Nazareth, now becomes our example in baptism. He had a vision of the
   opened heaven and received the approval of the Father, Mark 1:9-11.
   Immediately after the honour of heavenly recognition, Christ had His
   faith tried for 40 days in the wilderness by Satan, with the result
   that He came off more than conqueror, was strengthened spiritually for
   His work, was made more able to sympathize with the tempted, while
   Satan was weakened by defeat.

   LESSON--We shall ever have temptation, but we may ever have the
   sympathy and help of Christ, and find as He did that the Scriptures
   furnish the truth that will defeat the tempter. 1 Corinthians 10:13.

  Great Fact II. The Work of the Servant.

   Mark 1:14; 10:52.

   There is continuous, unbroken service and activity in this gospel.
   Thirteen out of the sixteen chapters begin with the word "and" AND He
   did this, AND He did that, He must teach them. Men were hopeless, He
   must cheer them up with the gospel tidings. Men were sick and
   suffering, He must relieve and heal them. Men were under the power of
   Satan, He must set them free. Men were sinful, He must pardon and
   cleanse them, and give them eternal Life.

   LESSON--It is our blessed privilege to follow Christ's example in doing
   good. He is worth serving, the work is worth doing, and souls are worth
   saving. When Brutus was visiting a friend he asked him if he was sick.
   "No, Brutus," he replied, If thou hast any noble enterprise in hand, I
   am well." We should have a like answer ready when the Lord bids us do
   His work. The builder builds for a century, we for eternity. The
   painter paints for a generation, we forever. The mason Cuts out the
   marble that soon perishes, but we may mould characters in the likeness
   of Christ that forever will endure! Christ teaches that he who would be
   the chiefest must serve the most!

  Great Fact III. The Rejection of the Servant.

   Mark 11; Mark 12; Mark 13.

   Christ presented Himself at Jerusalem according to the prophecy of
   Zechariah 9:9; and the people at first welcomed Him in the hope that He
   would secure them material freedom and glory. When, however, at the
   cleansing of the temple He proved that His mission was a spiritual one,
   He was hated by the religious leaders with a Satanic hatred, and as
   they plotted to put Him to death they fulfilled. Isaiah 53:3.

   LESSON--The greatest sin anyone can commit is to reject Christ, and yet
   everyone to whom the gospel is preached must either commit that sin or
   accept the Lord as his Saviour.

   A father who had a prodigal boy, on one special night begged him not to
   go out to spend the night drinking and gambling. The father urged that
   the boy's ways had killed the mother and were sending him in sorrow to
   his grave. As the boy would not yield, the old father laid down at the
   door and said. "U you are determined to go to ruin, you must go over
   this old body tonight." The son walked over the form of his father,
   trampled the love of his father under foot, and went out. This is the
   way of rejecters of Christ, they trample His blood underfoot, and go
   down to death.

  Great Fact IV. Sacrifice of the Servant.

   Mark 14; Mark 15.

   The great message of Isaiah is that the Son of God shall become the
   Servant of God in order to provide salvation for men. Isaiah 53; is the
   golden passion chapter of the Old Testament, in which the world's sin
   is seen to be laid upon the divine sacrifice.

   Mark records how the prophecies of Isaiah were fulfilled in the
   suffering of Gethsemane and Calvary. The key verse shows that Christ
   came not only to minister, and thus be our example in service, but also
   to be the world's sacrifice, by giving His life a ransom for many. He
   was sold for thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave. He was
   executed as only slaves were, indeed, He was the slave of man-kind!

   LESSON--The best sacrifice to a crucified Saviour is a broken and
   contrite heart, a life crucified to the world and the flesh. Let the
   ambitious lay their pride in the dust. Let the covetous rather lay up
   for themselves treasures in heaven. Let the Self-indulgent deny
   themselves. Judson ever strove to subdue all sense ward tendencies. He
   gave all his money into the mission treasury. Nursed the most loathsome
   diseases. Threw documents in the fire that would have made him famous,
   and often lived alone to give himself entirely to communion with God.
   Thus in response to the divine sacrifice, he became a grateful living
   sacrifice. Romans 12:1.

  Great Fact V. The Exaltation of the Servant.

   Mark 16.

   After the Servant has served and given His life as a ransom, He rises
   from the dead, gives the Great Commission also recorded in Matthew
   28:19-20, and then ascended into heaven to sit at the right hand of
   God, Matthew 16:19. He took upon Himself the form of a servant is now
   highly exalted Philippians 2:7-9. Seated at the place of honour and
   power He is constituted Head of the church. He acts as our heavenly
   -representative or advocate. Through his providences He is ever
   securing our increasing holiness and usefulness here, and our perfect
   happiness hereafter. His exaltation also explains why He is with us
   always He went away in the flesh that He might be ever near in the
   Spirit. Yea, He is with us all the days!

   WRITER--Luke was a native of Antioch n Syria, and in Colossians 4:14 is
   called the beloved physician. He is the only one of the Bible writers
   who was a Gentile. As a companion of Paul in his missionary journeys he
   was with him in his first and second imprisonments in Rome, and
   remain-'d faithful to him when others forsook he apostle. He was a
   fellow-labourer of Saul and so had abundant opportunity of earning all
   about Christ's life and teachings. It was probably at Paul's earnest
   realest that Luke wrote the gospel in 63 A. D. and also the Book of
   Acts about 64 A. D.

   PURPOSE--To show that the infinite eve and compassion of Jesus was not
   for the Jews only, but for all mankind.

GREAT FACTS: --

   Luke Is a Gospel of:--
    1. Praise.
    2. Prayer.
    3. Gentiles
    4. Poor.
    5. Parables.

  Great Fact I. A Gospel of Praise.

   Among the psalms of praise in Luke is he lofty hymn of Mary rejoicing
   in the remised Messiah. It is sometimes called the Magnificent, because
   in the Latin version it begins with the word, Luke 1:46-55. Then the
   song of Zacharias, in which he praises God for the goodly gift of a
   child who became John the Baptist, Luke 1:68-69. Then the song of the
   angels announcing the birth of Christ, and with happy adoration singing
   "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
   men." Luke 2:8-14. None on earth ever heard he angels sing, except
   these humble shepherds of Bethlehem, and none will hear them sing
   hereafter except they become devout believers like the shepherds. Then
   Simeon's hymn of thanksgiving, because he had lived to see the coming
   of the Saviour, and thus had the dearest wish of his heart fulfilled,
   Luke 2:29-33.

   LESSON--Christianity has given to the world more poems, hymns, anthems
   and expressions of triumph and joy than any other influence in men's
   lives. As the window that lets light into the house does not benefit
   the light, but the house into which the light shines, so the benefits
   of praise do not go to God but come back to us to comfort and refresh
   us.

   All God's works praise Him, but man should be the leading singer in the
   great choir. There is a beautiful legend that explains the origin of
   song. It says the goods came down to a sacred wood, and there played
   and sang. All creatures came to listen and learn a fragment of the
   celestial song. The listening wood learned its rustling, the stream its
   roar, the wind its echoing, and the birds the prelude of the song. Man
   only grasped it all, and so his song alone touches the depths of the
   human heart, and goes upward to God. Because it is true that man's
   music is the sweetest of all before the throne of God, each of us ought
   to find a tongue to bless God. We must not leave the choir and the
   organist to praise God for us, and ourselves stand dumb images in the
   pews. There's no praise by proxy, He has blessed us therefore we will
   glorify Him. Gratitude ought to make singers of us all.

  Great Fact II. A Gospel of Prayer.

   Jesus prays at His Baptism, Luke 3; Luke 4; Luke 5; Luke 6; Luke 7;
   Luke 8; Luke 9; Luke 10; Luke 11; Luke 12; Luke 13; Luke 14; Luke 15;
   Luke 16; Luke 17; Luke 18; Luke 19; Luke 20; Luke 21; and before
   choosing His twelve disciples, Luke 11:1-10. Jesus taught His disciples
   how to pray and urged perseverance in prayer, Luke 11:1-10. He
   commanded to watch and pray that we might escape the snares that shall
   come upon the world, 21:36. On the cross He prayed for His enemies,
   23:24, and spent His last moments in prayer, 23:46.

   LESSON--
    1. Christ taught the importance of prayer, for the condition of
       receiving God's blessings is that we ask. We should do this in
       secret, family and public Prayer.
    2. We must also feel that we cannot get along without God. All the
       prayer is the cry of felt weakness as was Peter's cry, "Save Lord,
       or I perish."
    3. We must put away all doubts as to the reality_ of divine answers to
       prayer. We must believe "that God is and that He is the rewarder of
       them that diligently seek Him." 4. Holiness of life is necessary if
       we would have answers to our prayers. "If I regard iniquity in my
       heart, the Lord will not hear me." By example and teaching Christ
       emphasized prayer more than any other one thing. Let us therefore
       find success and happiness in constant prayer.

  Great Fact III. A Gospel for the Gentiles.

   Perhaps the hardest lesson that the Jews and early Christians had to
   learn was that the vast Gentile world might have full and free
   admission to the kingdom and the churches. Yet here Simeon teaches that
   salvation is a light to lighten the Gentiles, Luke 2:32. Christ sent
   the seventy disciples not to the lost sheep of the house of Israel but
   to "every city and every place," Luke 10:1. Christ's Perean ministry
   over the eastern side of the Jordan was to the Gentiles, Luke 5:1-28.

   LESSON--The Jews having envied bitter treatment from the Gentiles in
   Babylon, regarded them with extreme scorn and hatred. They held them to
   be ceremonially unclean and would have no friendly intercourse with
   them. Gentiles were thought to be the enemies of God and of His people,
   to whom the knowledge of God was denied unless they became proselytes,
   and even then they could not be admitted to full fellowship. Luke,
   however, pictures Christ as tearing down all local and national
   barriers, and making repentance and faith the only conditions of
   admission into the kingdom, Luke 24:47. Then in Acts 10:44; we find the
   Holy Spirit given to Gentile believers as it was to the Jews at
   Pentecost. This shows that the religion of Christ is not merely one of
   the religions of the world, but the great world religion, adapted to
   all nations and all classes, under the power of which every kindred and
   every tribe will one day crown Him Lord of all.

  Great Fact IV. A Gospel for the Poor.

   Luke records the parents of Jesus offering a pair of turtle-doves,
   because they were too poor to present a lamb, Luke 2:24. Christ
   pronounced a special blessing on the Door comforting them with the
   thought, that although they must work hard, and fare hard, yet if they
   follow Him they should have all the privileges and graces of the
   kingdom hereafter, Luke 6:20.In a parable of the Gospel Feast, Christ
   turned away from those who were too full of pride, or business, or
   pleasure, and offered Is bounties to the poor and crippled, Luke 14:21.

   LESSON--Christ taught that money cannot buy love, contentment,
   friendship, salvation, or heaven. Indeed, experience has taught that It
   is much easier to be contented without riches than with them. Dr.
   Curler said the happiest heart be ever knew was a poor crippled woman.
   He never saw a frown on her face, and when she came to church it shone
   like the face of an angel. She lived every day on the sunny side of
   Providence and fed hungrily on the promises. So near did she live to
   Jesus that she often caught the music of that "marriage supper" for
   which she had her wedding garment on. Would that some of the
   sour-spirited, blue, discouraged Christians could borrow a vial of her
   sunshine!

  Great Fact V. A Gospel of Parables.

   The one and only teacher of parables in the New Testament is Christ
   Himself, and Luke has seventeen more of His parables than all the other
   three gospel writers put together. A parable both reveals and conceals
   the truth. It revealed the truth to His disciples but concealed it from
   His enemies. When Jesus saw in the second year of His ministry that the
   nation still clung to the carnal ideals of what the Messiah would be,
   and would not accept Him, He then spoke to the multitudes in parables,
   and by and by when He was alone with the Twelve, He would explain the
   parables to them.

   LESSON--We must take heed how we hear, and then sit at the feet of the
   Blessed Teacher Himself if we would know all the secrets of divine
   truth. While most men learned nothing from the lily, the fig tree, the
   sowing of grain, the bramble and thorn, the mustard seed, the wheat and
   the tares, Jesus has taken us by the hand and led us into their
   imperishable lessons as we would lead a child into an enchanted castle.
   All through the Bible, and not only in the stories themselves, we have
   lost sheep, and lost coins, unjust stewards, prodigal sons, virgins,
   talents, good Samaritans and labourers in the vineyard. Happy are we if
   we turn these parables inside out and find their golden lessons.
   Happier still if we find all nature and life to be parables full of
   heavenly lessons.

   WRITER--The Apostle John who wrote five books in all--this gospel, the
   three epistles and Revelation. His father, Zebedee, a fisherman of
   Bethsaida, was in good circumstances, and his mother, Salome, was a
   devout follower of the Lord. John was about 25 years of age when called
   by Christ early in His ministry, and so devoted was he to the Master
   that he was called "the beloved disciple," John 12:23. With James and
   Peter he was selected by Christ to witness His transfiguration, and go
   with Him in the garden of Gethsemane. John was present at the raising
   of Jairus' daughter, and at the crucifixion, and was the first disciple
   at the tomb after the news of the resurrection. In His later life he is
   thought to have been the pastor of the church at Ephesus, and was
   banished from there to the Isle of Patmos where he wrote the
   Revelation.

   DATE--About 90 A. D. Place--Ephesus.

   PURPOSE--"That ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
   God, and that believing ye might live through His name," John 20:31.

GREAT FACTS:--

   John Is a Gospel of:--
    1. Divinity.
    2. Eternal Life.
    3. Spirituality.
    4. Trinity.

   THE TIMES OF JOHN--Jerusalem had been destroyed twenty years
   previously, and the temple with it, which weakened the religion of the
   Jews. The gospel had been preached all over the Roman empire and had
   made a great impression everywhere. All the books of the New Testament
   except this gospel and Revelation had been written, so that the facts
   and doctrines of the gospel were getting to be well known. Already,
   however, false teachers were arising who denied that Jesus Christ was
   truly the Son of God come in the flesh. John therefore, writes just
   those scenes, works, and words of Jesus that reveal His divine person
   and power, grace and glory.

  Great Fact I. The Gospel of Christ's Divinity.

   The gospel of John is the most read and the best loved because it
   treats of the person of Jesus Christ. If John did not know Christ, then
   no one knew Him, for John had not only the best, but the latest
   knowledge of Jesus. With John everything in heaven and earth, of time
   and eternity all centred about Christ. John taught that
    1. Christ was God the Son,
    2. that He existed back in the beginning with God the Father,
    3. that in Him the prophecies of the Old Testament were fulfilled,
    4. that He was the perfect teacher;
    5. perfectly sinless,
    6. the perfect example,
    7. that He wrought miracles as none else ever did,
    8. that He arose from the dead,
    9. that He will return for His servants.

   LESSON--Because Christ was divinely sent, divinely announced, and
   divinely attested. Because He spoke divinely, lived divinely and
   wrought divinely. Because of His perfect character, perfect teachings,
   and perfect salvation, we should say with Thomas, "Thou are my Lord and
   my God!" We should always reverently speak of Thu as the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and take every opportunity of praising that Name that if above
   every name!

  Great Facts II. The Gospel of Eternal Life.

   John teaches that the soul by sin has lost it spiritual life, its first
   purity, its harmony and happiness arising from peace and friendship
   with God. The soul left God like a falling star from its central sun,
   and is truly described as being dead; dead in sin, dead to God, and
   dead to heaven. In John 5:24 we see that Christ came to give us eternal
   life. Eternal because it is not temporary and fading. Eternal because
   it is not material and eternal because it is the life of God, which
   .restores His image to the soul. This eternal life comes by believing
   in Christ. As we believe, the Holy Spirit applies the very life of
   Christ Himself to our hearts, and a spiritual nature is born in us,
   John 10:10.

   LESSON--The "I ams" of Christ are not only beautiful, but full of
   meaning. "I am the life," means a new nature from Christ. "I am the
   Way," means progress in Christ. "I am the Vine," means fellowship with
   Christ. "I am the Good Shepherd," means the watch-care of Christ. "I am
   the Bread of life," means spiritual food from Christ. "I am the Light
   of the World," means spiritual instruction from Christ. "I am the
   Resurrection and the Life," means final triumph in Christ.

   A friend who had an orange orchard told Mr. Moody to take some fruit
   whenever he wanted any. He, therefore, did not go to an orange tree and
   pray that the oranges would fall into his pocket, but walked up to a
   tree, reached out his hand and took the oranges. The friend said
   "Take," and he took. God offers us the gift of eternal life. Romans
   6:23. He says, "Take!" Shall we take it?

  Great Facts III. It Is a Spiritual Gospel.

   John's gospel is known as the spiritual gospel because it deals much
   with the heavenly origin and life of our Lord, and of the spiritual
   facts of the Christian life. It is the gospel of

    1. The spiritual birth. In reply to Nicodemus, John 3:3, Jesus taught
       that all must be born again, which means that every sinner must
       have the change of heart that is wronged by the Holy Spirit when he
       repentingly believes in Jesus Christ. Natural birth makes us like
       our earthly parent, and spiritual birth makes us like our Heavenly
       Father. If you had an incurable thief in the family, it would help
       little to give him a change of clothing, or supply him with fine
       shoes or adorn him with jewellery. No, nothing on the outside would
       help, it would take a complete change in the man's thoughts,
       desires and nature. Thus when the Holy Spirit would change a lost
       wicked man, He begins not with his outward words and acts, but with
       his heart. He makes him to hate every sin and to love every virtue.
       A new spiritual nature leads to new ritual conduct.
    2. Spiritual worship. While the heathen worshipped the sun, moon,
       etc., "Greeks their unknown God," and the Samaritans the God of the
       temple, Jesus taught that true worship did not depend upon
       so-called holy places, or holy ordinances, or holy ritual, but
       rather upon the sincere, reverent prayer and praise of each heart,
       John 4:24. Worship is the loving attempt to pay our unpayable debt
       of love--the expression of devoted hearts. Public worship of God in
       the presence of His people is a necessity of the Christian's life,
       but spiritual Christians will always think less of the forms and
       ceremonies than they will of the power and spirit of worship.
    3. Spiritual growth. Christ is ever represented as giving better,
       larger, more abundant life, John 10:10. It is more abundant life
       than that which was forfeited by sin, more abundant that that which
       was promised by the law of Moses, yea it is far exceeding abundant,
       more than we are able to ask or think. This larger life must have
       an ever-growing fruitfulness. Jesus had often said to His
       disciples, "Come unto Me, Follow Me, Learn of Me, Abide In Me," hut
       in the fifteenth chapter He says, "Be increasingly fruitful for
       Me." He expects us all to be third-degree fruit bearers, not only
       to bear fruit and more fruit, John 16:2, but much fruit, John 15:8.
       This fruit which is ninefold and is specified in Galatians 5:22-23,
       will prove the reality of our religion, and also glorify the
       Father.

  Great Facts IV. The Gospel of the Holy Trinity.

   John teaches that there is one only true God, but that in the Godhead
   there are three eternal distinctions, which are represented to us under
   the figure of persons and these three the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
   are equal. Christ declares that He and the Father are one, John 10:30.
   In John 14:16, all Three Persons are brought together in one verse.
   Indeed as we read through this gospel, particularly John 15; John 16,
   we clearly see three manifestations of the one God, God the Father, God
   the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. A converted Indian gave the following
   reasons for his belief in the Trinity: "We. go down to the river in
   winter, and we see it covered with snow, dig through the snow, and we
   come to the ice; we chop through the ice, and we come to the water;
   snow is water, ice is water, and water is water; therefore, the three
   are one."

  I. The Gospel Preached at Jerusalem

   Acts 1; Acts 2; Acts 3; Acts 4; Acts 5; Acts 6; Acts 7.

   Our Lord having promised a special imparation of the Holy Spirit to the
   Apostles, they waited in the upper room at Jerusalem for ten days. In
   the meantime Mathias was chosen by lot to succeed Judas, Acts 1:26.
   Fifty days after the crucifixion, at the time of the Jewish feast of
   harvest or Pentecost, the assembled disciples heard a sound like the
   rushing of a great wind, and flames of fire in the shape of tongues
   rested above the head of each disciple. Then they were filled with the
   Holy Spirit, and thus endowed for special service. This enabled them to
   preach, not only with divine power, but in the different languages
   represented that day at Jerusalem, Acts 1:2-4. The multitude accused
   the apostles of being drunk, but Peter pointed out that it was only 9
   a. m., before which hour no Jew would taste wine. He urged them that
   this was the coming of the Spirit, prophesised in Joel 2:28, told them
   they had wickedly put the Son of God to death, and pleaded with them to
   repent of their sins and be baptized. Great numbers believed. and three
   thousand persons were baptized, and added to the church that day. After
   a short period of delightful Christian fellowship this large number of
   converts went home to tell their countrymen how God had visited His
   people.

   At the beautiful Gate of the Temple, Peter healed an incurable cripple
   which brought a great crowd of people to Solomon's porch. This gave
   Peter another chance to preach that the Christ whom they had crucified
   was the long-promised Messiah. So powerful was the appeal that the
   number of converts now reached 5,000. Acts 4:4.

   This so stirred up the same Jewish leaders who had crucified Christ
   that the Apostles were forbidden to preach Jesus, Acts 4:18. The church
   became so self-denying and enthusiastic that many sold their
   Possessions, and gave the proceeds to the Apostles for distribution
   according to each man's needs. Ananias and his wife sought to deceive
   the apostles and God in this matter and were punished with instant
   death, Acts 5:4. The apostles continued their wonderful work, which
   again aroused the opposition of the Sanhedrin (or Jewish ecclesiastical
   court of 70 judges). The Apostles were beaten with rods, and prohibited
   to preach, but rejoicing they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus
   Christ, Acts 5:42.

   Seven deacons are now chosen to look after the growing business of the
   church, 6:3. Stephen, the leader among them, a man full of faith and
   power, becomes the first Christian martyr because of his
   heart-searching preaching.

   LESSONS--
    1. Note that the first period of Acts is taken up with the work at
       Jerusalem, with Peter as the leader.
    2. Our Lord Himself founded the church, (Matthew 16:18) out of His
       inner circle of baptized disciples, but the organization within the
       same came after Pentecost, Acts 2:47.
    3. The baptism of the Spirit must not be confused with the filling of
       the Spirit. Every believer is born of the Spirit, John 3:6, indwelt
       by the Spirit, 1 Corinthians 6:19, and should be filled with the
       Spirit, Ephesians 3:12.

  Great Fact II. The Gospel Preached in Palestine.

   Acts 8; Acts 7; Acts 8; Acts 9; Acts 10; Acts 11; Acts 12.

   The death of Stephen instead of being a calamity was really a great
   blessing, for it scattered gospel preachers all over Judea and Samaria.
   In the city of Samaria, there were many conversions and great joy,
   through the preaching of Philippians 3:8. The Ethiopian Eunuch was
   converted and baptized, Acts 3:38. The bitter but brilliant Saul was
   converted, and became Paul the great apostle of the Gentiles, 9:1-30.
   Peter, who had used the keys of the Kingdom of God at Pentecost,
   Matthew 16; Matthew 17; Matthew 18; Matthew 19, now uses them again in
   opening the gospel door to Gentiles, Acts 10; Acts 11. Persecution
   again conies upon the church, with the martyrdom of James, and the
   arrest of Peter. Peter however, is delivered by an angel, and Herod the
   persecutor, died a shameful death. Acts 12.

   LESSONS--
    1. In this section the centre of Christianity is changed from
       Jerusalem in Antioch, where the disciples were first called
       Christians. The new church prove to be a worthy one for it was the
       first to send out missionaries to the heathen, and first to take up
       a collection for the mother church at Jerusalem, when it was
       suffering from famine.
    2. Acts 10:44 is one of the pivotal points in scripture, for it marks
       the Pentecost of the Gentiles. Here is no laying on of apostolic
       hands, and no delay but the Holy Spirit is immediately given upon
       simple faith in Christ. This is the normal order for the gospel
       age.

  Great Facts III. Paul's First Missionary Journey.

   Acts 13; Acts 14.

   The church at Antioch in a great sacrificial spirit now sends out the
   first with foreign missionaries. Barnabas and Paul, with John and Mark,
   (who wrote the 2nd gospel) set out for Asia Minor with the motto,
   "Christ for all the world, and all the world for Christ!" It is
   interesting to trace their progress through fourteen cities, with the
   aid of a map. At Perga, Mark turns back from the work and goes home to
   the deep regret of the apostles. The reason probably was because he
   objected to the offer of salvation to the Gentiles, on condition of
   faith alone. Two years later Paul was unwilling to try Mark a second
   time, but afterwards forgave him, counted him a fellow-worker, and
   found him a great comfort, Philemon 24.

   SOME RESULTS--An imposter stricken blind, Acts 13:11. Many Jews
   believe, but others bitterly oppose, so that the apostles turned to the
   Gentile, Acts 13:43, 45-46. An incurable cripple healed and an attempt
   made to worship the apostles as gods, Acts 14:8-11. Paul afterward
   stoned and left for dead, Acts 14:19. After full consultation with the
   brethren, officers were appointed in every church, Acts 14:23.

  Great Facts IV. The Church Council at Jerusalem.

   Acts 15.

   After Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch, certain Jewish Christians
   urged that the Gentiles could not be saved unless they were
   circumcised, and kept the law of Moses. The church at Antioch therefore
   decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem to consult with the
   other apostles and elders about the matter. On their arrival a meeting
   was called, at which the question was earnestly discussed. Peter urged
   that they should not put under the Law, those to whom God had given the
   Spirit, and James, the brother of the Lord, agreed with him. The
   council therefore decided that Gentile converts need not be
   circumcised, but should abstain from idolatry, fornication, from blood
   and from things strangled. This decision reaffirming that men are saved
   by the grace of the Lord Jesus alone. Acts 15:11 was of far-reaching
   importance to the early churches.

  Great Facts V. Paul's Second Missionary Journey.

   Acts 15:36-18:22.

   Before starting on the second journey there were two disagreements
   among the apostles. Paul rebuked Peter for drawing a caste line between
   Jews and Gentiles in the church. Galatians 2:11-14. And then being
   unwilling to take Mark on the second journey, he himself with Silas
   went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches, and
   Barnabas and Mark went to the Island of Cyprus. At Lystra Paul finding
   a young man named Timothy, who was wise in the scriptures, he led him
   to Christ, and chose him as a companion in order that he also might
   learn to become a preacher of the blessed gospel, Acts 16:1. At Troas,
   the Holy Spirit in a vision directed the apostles to take the gospel
   for the first time to Europe, the starting point being Phillipi, in
   Macedonia. Luke has now joined the missionary party, Acts 16:10. The
   first convert in Europe was Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed garments.
   Phillipi is famous for Paul's imprisonment, the earthquake, and
   conversion of the jailer. The church at Thessalonica is founded, Acts
   17:4. Also the church at Corinth, where the apostles stay 18 months,
   Acts 18:8. At the famous city of Athens Paul found an altar to "The
   Unknown God," and preached a sermon on Mar's Hill. The apostles then
   return to Antioch by way of Ephesus, after an absence of three or four
   years.

  Great Facts VI. Paul's Third Missionary journey.

   On the third tour the apostle with Timothy directed his attention
   chiefly to Ephesus where they stayed for three years, and where
   multitudes of the Jews and Gentiles of Asia heard the gospel preached.
   Ephesus was notorious for its luxury, licentiousness, and the worship
   of the goddess Diana. Enthusiastic converts burned their books of
   magic, and turned away from their silver idols. The silversmiths
   therefore stirred up a riot, and the apostles were rescued from danger
   only by the help of one of the city officials. At Ephesus Paul wrote
   First Corinthians. Acts 16:8. At Troas Paul preached with great
   success, and at Phillipi wrote Second Corinthians. He now collects
   money for poor Christians in Judea. Hearing that Judizing teachers were
   misleading the church at Galatia, he wrote the epistle to the Galatians
   to overthrow the errors. Three months are spent at Corinth, and the
   epistle to the Romans written and sent by Phebe. Paul now makes a last
   visit to Jerusalem where he was received kindly by the church, and much
   encouraged them by telling what God was doing among the Gentiles.

  Great Facts VII. Paul's Arrest and Closing Ministry.

   Acts 21:27-end.

   The Jews of Asia now accuse Paul of slighting the law and of bringing
   Gentiles into the temple. In the midst of an uproar he is arrested, and
   makes his defence before the multitude, and before the Roman governor,
   Felix at Caesarea. After two years' imprisonment because of the
   wavering policy of Felix, Paul was tried again by the new governor,
   Festus, but Paul appealed from him to Caesar, the emperor of Rome.
   After a most exciting voyage, with a shipwreck off the coast of Malta,
   Paul arrived in Rome and was kept a prisoner for another two years,
   during which, soldiers and even servants in Nero's palace were
   converted. In these two years the epistles to the Philemon, Colossians,
   Ephesians and Philippians were written. Paul is now freed, spends two
   years in Spain, Romans 15:28; returns to Ephesus and Crete, and finding
   false teachers busy, writes First Timothy and Titus. Being again
   arrested and hurried to Rome, he writes Second Timothy in jail,
   expecting any hour to be "offered up." He is now condemned and
   beheaded, and his body buried in the catacombs of Rome in which other
   noble martyrs often hid in times of fierce persecution.

   NOTE--Churches had now sprung up all over the known world. Most of the
   New Testament had been written. The gospel had outgrown its Jewish
   clothes and was seen to be the world-gospel. Jerusalem, Antioch and
   Rome were the early centres of Christianity.

     * KEY PHRASE--"A GUILTY WORLD NEEDS JUSTIFICATION BEFORE GOD."

   Home Readings.

   Romans has been called the greatest epistle of the greatest apostle,
   because it contains the clearest and fullest teachings of Christian
   truth. Luther urged that it should be memorized. At any rate, let us
   read all of it often. For the family altar read:
     * Sunday--The whole world is guilty,--Romans 1:14-23.
     * Monday--Justification is the gospel remedy,--Romans 3:21-31.
     * Tuesday--Some results of justification,--Romans 5:1-8.

   WRITER--Paul. He was born of pure Jewish descent at Tarsus, the capital
   of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, 80 miles northwest of Antioch. While Christ
   was preaching he was receiving his education from Gamaliel, the great
   teacher of the Pharisees. Like all Jewish boys he learned a trade, that
   of tent-making. He became a leading persecutor of those whom he
   believed were following a false messiah, but was miraculously converted
   while on a heresy-hunting trip to Damascus. After his baptism and
   commission to preach the gospel, he retired to Arabia for study and
   meditation for three years. He then evangelized Cilicia for three
   years, worked one year at Antioch, went forth on his three great
   missionary journeys, founded many churches, wrote thirteen epistles,
   and after a life of constant and exalted sacrifices, sealed his
   testimony with his own lifeblood.

   THE CHURCH AT ROME Founded not by Peter, for he confined his ministry
   to the Jews, Galatians 2:9, but most likely by visitors from Rome who
   were converted at Pentecost.

   OCCASION--
    1. The Jews and Gentiles were inclined not to recognize one another as
       having equal standing in grace.
    2. They were inclined to the error that the more they sinned the more
       grace would abound, Romans 6:1.

   PURPOSE--To show that the need of Jew and Gentile alike is
   justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Spirit.

   PLACE OF WRITING--Corinth, while on third missionary journey.

   DATE--58 A.D.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Guilt.
    2. Justification
    3. Sanctification.
    4. Jews.
    5. Consecration.

  Great Fact I. The World's Guilt Before God.

   Romans 1; Romans 2; Romans 3:20.

   After Paul's greeting to the church, and his thanksgiving for their
   faith, he then glories in the gospel, Romans 1:16, for its power, and
   for the righteousness it reveals and imparts. In Romans 1:19-23 he
   describes how some of the former worshipers of God, who were the
   descendants of Noah, drifted into heathenism. In graphic words he told
   of the seven downward steps that has landed the millions of the race
   into heathen darkness.
    1. They would not worship or obey God.
    2. They attributed to luck and chance things they should have traced
       to God.
    3. Their hearts became perverted and darkened.
    4. Relied upon their own wisdom instead of upon that which comes from
       above.
    5. Although cultured in other respects, in religion they became fools,
       or superstitious.
    6. Against the solemn warning in the Ten Commandments they set up
       idols in the forms of Jupiter, dogs, cats, serpents, etc.

   With this turning away from the true and living God, the Gentiles went
   into the blackest night of vice and cruelty, so that virtue and
   conscience seemed almost extinct. Paul next reminds the Jews that
   although they possessed scriptures, the covenants and the Sabbaths, yet
   they so dishonoured God that His name was blasphemed among the Gentiles
   because of them, Romans 2:24. The conclusion is given in Romans 3:9-20.

   LESSON--History, conscience and the scriptures all bear witness to the
   fact that "there is none righteous, no, not one." In thought, word,
   deed or motive we are all guilty before God. Neither can the outward
   observances of religion, nor the Law save us. The Law simply gives us a
   knowledge of sin. The wife of a drunkard once found her husband with
   torn clothes, matted hair, and bruised face, asleep after a drunken
   revel. She had a portrait of him taken in all his wretched condition,
   and placed it beside another which showed him handsome and well dressed
   as he had been in other days. When he became sober and saw the two
   pictures he awakened to his true condition and arose to a better life.
   The picture did not save him, but it showed him his true state. Thus we
   should be aroused by Paul's wonderful picture of the degradation to
   which sin leads.

  Great Fact II. The Gospel Remedy Is Justification by Faith.

   Romans 3:21-5:11.

   Justification means that God freely gives that righteousness that man
   can neither merit nor otherwise obtain, and yet without which he must
   perish. "It is like a house that with open door invites ALL MEN to take
   shelter from the coming storm of judgement, but for THE BELIEVER it is
   like a broad and effectual shield that wards off all condemnation."
    1. Grace is the SOURCE of justification, Romans 3:24, because it
       originated in the mercy and loving kindness of God. God provided
       It, Christ performed it, and the Holy Spirit applies it.
    2. The blood of Jesus Christ is the GROUND of justification, Romans
       5:9, because Christ's atonement met every claim of eternal justice,
       and God can justly accept us when clothed in His righteousness.
    3. Faith is the MEANS by which we receive justification, Romans 5:1,
       for faith lays hold upon God's grace and Christ's sacrifice, and
       claims them for its personal saving possession.
    4. Works are the EVIDENCE of justification. James 2:4, for real vital
       faith will manifest itself in real vital works. and holy deeds
       accompany Heavenly hopes.

   The seven fold results of justification are seen in Romans 5:1-5.
    1. Peace with God.
    2. Access into grace.
    3. Rejoicing in the hope of God's final triumph over all evil.
    4. Glory in tribulation.
    5. Patience.
    6. Deepening religious experience.
    7. Love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.

   Justification therefore takes care of all the sin and guilt upon us,
   buries all this sin and guilt upon us, buries all this sin and guilt in
   the grave of Christ, and sits us in Heavenly places together with Him.

  Great Facts III. The Sanctification of the Believer.

   Romans 5:12-8:39.

   As Christ in justification delivers us from the guilt of sin, so the
   Holy Spirit in sanctification delivers us from the power and habits of
   sin. From the first Adam we inherited a sinful nature and physical
   death. In Christ the believer receives a spiritual nature, eternal life
   and glory. The signs of sanctification are:--

    1. Crucifixion of sin, Romans 6:6;
    2. the Holy Spirit dwells in us, Romans 8:9,
    3. the Spirit leads us into all the privileges of Sonship, Romans
       8:14;
    4. the Spirit pleads with God for us, Romans 8:26;
    5. We are more and more conformed to the image of God's Son, Romans
       8:29;
    6. Nothing is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ,
       Romans 8:28-29.

   In the seventh chapter is seen the struggle in the soul between the law
   of God and the law of sin, between grace and corruption, but the
   blessed eighth chapter where the work of the Spirit is mentioned 19
   times, is full of the believer's deliverance, privileges and assurance.
   In Romans 8:28 the believer sits in God's arm-chair, and in Romans 8:29
   has around him God's golden chain of Foreknowledge, Predestination,
   Calling, Justification and Glorification.

  Great Facts IV. God's Dealing With the Jews.

   Romans 9; Romans 10; Romans 11.

   Here the apostle sorrows over the Jews' rejection of Christ, but
   assures them that the gospel does not set aside the covenants God has
   made with them. He claims, however, that God had a perfect right to
   turn to the Gentiles, because the Jews would not seek righteousness by
   faith, Romans 9:32. In Romans 10; Paul pleads with the Jews to confess
   with their mouths the Lord Jesus, and to believe on Him with their
   hearts. In Romans 11; we are told that the blindness of Israel is not a
   perpetual blindness, and that a time is coming when the Jews, as a
   nation, shall be restored to God's favour, and become a still greater
   blessing to the Gentiles, Romans 11:12-15. In the meantime the Gentiles
   are not to boast for they could be as easily cast off as were the Jews,
   Romans 11:21.

   LESSON--It is as if a king returned from a far country and found his
   whole kingdom in revolt. He first appeals to that section with which he
   has the closest and tenderest ties. But his claims are ignored and
   treated with contempt. Collecting, however, a loyal few he begins to
   subdue his own provinces. Thus, Jesus, King of the Jews, first came
   into His own, but when His own received Him not, He, with His apostles,
   turned unto the Gentiles, and not in vain as the history of the
   centuries has proved. However, the conversion of the Jews is one of the
   important events of the future, and will mean the enrichment of the
   world.

  Great Facts V. The Christian's Consecration and Duties.

   Romans 12; Romans 13; Romans 14; Romans 15; Romans 16.

   Out of gratitude to God for all His spiritual blessings, we are to
   yield our bodies as living, willing and daily sacrifices unto Him. The
   old dispensation was one of blood and death. Daily, weekly, monthly and
   yearly the altars ran with the blood of slain beasts. But the gospel
   says, "No more!" For there has been offered one sacrifice for sins
   forever, and what is wanted now is YOUR bodies, not the bodies of
   beasts and of birds, but YOUR bodies, and LIVING, not dead, Romans
   12:1-2. In the spirit of meekness and faithfulness we should use the
   spiritual gifts God has given us, Romans 12:3-8. What the Christian's
   attitude should be to those inside the church is given in Romans
   12:9-16, and to those outside the church in Romans 12:17-21. The
   Christian's attitude as a citizen is given in Romans 13:1-10, and
   watchfulness for the Lord's return enjoined in Romans 13:11-14. The
   Christian's attitude to those who are weak in the faith is given in
   Romans 14; Romans 15:3, and then this great epistle closes with
   personal matters, greetings and benedictions.

   LESSON--Romans makes much of the believer being "In Christ." In Christ
   for Pardon and purity, for rest and resurrection. These words were very
   familiar and precious to the early Christians. So much so that they
   inscribed them on the tombs of their departed friends. And mourners
   wiped away their tears when they saw over their loved one's graves. "In
   Christ!"

   WRITER--Paul.

   TIME AND PLACE OF WRITING,--57 A. D. at Ephesus.

   THE CITY OF CORINTH--Corinth in Paul's day was the largest and richest
   city of Greece, with a population of about 400,000. It was a seething
   mass of Jews, Merchants, philosophers and adventurers, but the Greeks
   stamped their own character upon the majority of the inhabitants. They
   became known all over the world for their readiness to quarrel, for
   their vain fancies in religion, and for their moral sins. Due to the
   debasing worship of the heathen goddess Aphrodite, there was much
   dishonesty, drunkenness and immorality, and it was against these sins
   that the apostle so strongly preached and wrote.

   THE CHURCH AT CORINTH--Paul preached at Corinth for eighteen months, at
   first to the Jews, until their hatred turned Him to Gentiles. In Acts
   18, we see that Paul lived with Aquila and Priscilla, and joined them
   in the trade of tent-making. From the light thrown upon the condition
   of the church we see that the evil practices of the city soon crept
   into the. church. Christian went to law with Christian before heathen
   judges, the sacredness of the Lord's Supper was forgotten, the women of
   the church forsook the old standards of modesty in the name of
   Christian liberty, the members were divided on questions of marriage
   and spiritual gifts. They therefore wrote the apostle asking his advice
   on these matters, and he replied in two epistles, First and Sec and
   Corinthians.

   PURPOSE--To correct divisions and disorders in the church and to show
   that the problems of everyday life should be decided by great Christian
   principles.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Divisions.
    2. Disorders.
    3. Liberty.
    4. Supper.
    5. Gifts.
    6. Resurrection.

  Great Facts I. Divisions in the Church.

   1 Corinthians 1; 1 Corinthians 2; 1 Corinthians 3; 1 Corinthians 4.

   Paul here earnestly warns the church against the party spirit. The
   defeating and disputing spirit of Greek party politics had entered into
   the church, resulting in four separate parties, each striving for the
   mastery. The Paul, Apollos and Peter parties each adopted the name and
   views of their favourite preacher and leader, while the Christ party
   degraded into a party watchword the sacred name of Christ, claiming
   that they had an exclusive interest in that Name, which, in realty, is
   the precious possession of every true believer, 1 Corinthians 1:12-13.
   In astonished indignation Paul replies, "Can you follow a mere man as
   though HE had been crucified for you? Has Christ been parcelled into
   fragments? Is there a Pauline or a Petrine Christ?" "Your party spirit
   is a sin, and all the worse a sin because it is paraded in the name of
   the holy zeal!" Such trusting in human wisdom is foolish, and makes the
   cross of Christ of no effect. Christ alone is the power of God and
   wisdom of God, 1 Corinthians 1:24. Gospel truth owes nothing to human
   wisdom, but God revealed it to men who were prepared by His spirit, 1
   Corinthians 2. Their divisions had made them weak, fleshy and childish,
   but Christian service is acceptable only when done in the spirit of
   Christ and for the glory of Christ, 1 Corinthians 3. Paul then declares
   that the one thing needed is not smartness, nor knowledge, nor success,
   but faithfulness, 1 Corinthians 4:2, and he then compares the inflated
   pride of the church with the humility and patience of the apostles, 1
   Corinthians 4:9-13.

   LESSON--The greatest danger to churches arises from within, and is the
   danger of divisions and factions. If two ships at sea of the same
   squadron are scattered by storm from each other, how can they help each
   other, as they were so intended? If again they clash together, how can
   ones endanger the other without hurting itself? An old proverb says if
   we knock each other we sink together!

  11. Morel Disorders in the Church.

   1 Corinthians 5; 1 Corinthians 6.

   Here is a case where a member actually married his own step-mother,
   which was socially immoral among the heathen, let alone among
   Christians. Yet the church was so unspiritual :hat it was utterly
   unconcerned about the matter. Paul, however, urges that no evil be
   tolerated among those who are Christ's. Just as the Jew put away all
   leaven before eating the Passover, so all corrupt men must be excluded
   from the Lord's table, for just as leaven spreads all through the
   dough, so a bad man's spirit is contagious in the church. The church
   should, therefore, promptly exclude the wrong-doer as evidence that it
   does not condone the wrong, 1 Corinthians 5:13. The apostle next urges
   that it is a shame for Christians to go to law with each other in
   heathen courts, for in so doing they dishonour God and deny their
   relationship to Him. The proper way to settle such matters is given in
   Matthew 18:15-17. The believer should abstain from over-eating and
   drunkenness and fornication, for the beds exists not for excesses, but
   for the Lord, and it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, 1 Corinthians
   6:13-19.

  Great Facts III. Liberty in the Church.

   1 Corinthians 7; 1 Corinthians 8; 1 Corinthians 9; 1 Corinthians 10; 1
   Corinthians 11:16.

   Here the apostle discusses the relation of the Christian to marriage,
   and to things offered to idols, and of the Christian woman's
   head-dress. Some in the church sought to discredit marriage, and would
   divorce a heathen partner, the apostle. however, because of the evil
   conditions existing in the city, advised every man to have his own
   wife, and every woman her husband. He further declares that a believer
   should not divorce a heathen partner, for the association of that
   unbeliever with Christ's people will likely lead to his or her
   salvation, 1 Corinthians 7:16. 2 Corinthians 6:14, however, forbids
   mixed marriages. He declared that when a Christian bought meat that had
   been offered to idols, because he realized that the idol was a mere
   lifeless, powerless image and not a god, then he was free from sin, but
   if his action was misunderstood by those who did not have this perfect
   knowledge, then the strong Christian should not let his liberty by a
   stumbling block to the weak in the faith, 1 Corinthians 8:9. Again some
   of the women of the church were inclined to carry their Christian
   liberty too far by discarding their veils, which with the Greeks, were
   signs of womanly modesty. This created a wrong impression among
   unbelievers, and reacted against the church, so the apostle argued
   against the practice, 1 Corinthians 11:5-16.

   LESSON--It is remarkable that the scriptures do not lay down petty
   little rules as to conduct, but allow all the scope of action that a
   devout heart could wish. However, Christian liberty does not mean the
   right to do as we like, but rather to do as we ought. Because we are
   members one of another, and our example harms or blesses, we should not
   do a questionable thing because we think it does not harm us. The
   question is, does it harm younger or weaker Christians? Does it harm
   the church? Does it hold back the coming of the kingdom in the world?

  Great Facts IV. The Lord's Supper in the Church.

   1 Corinthians 11:17-34.

   It was the custom of this church to eat a meal in connection with the
   Lord's Supper, and this led to excesses and to the unworthy observance
   of the Supper itself. Paul, therefore, reminds them of the deep
   spiritual meaning of the hallowed ordinance.
    1. It is a remembrance of Christ's dying love.
    2. It is a spiritual feasting upon Christ, 1 Corinthians 10:16.
    3. It proclaims to the world, not a new sacrifice, but the ever-new
       sacrifice of Calvary.
    4. It is a pledge of His coming again, 1 Corinthians 11:26.

   Therefore, we should not eat or drink in an unworthy manner, and what
   is very important never eat without self-Judgement, spiritual Insight,
   thankful love and holy resolves.

  Great Facts V. Spiritual Gifts of the Church.

   1 Corinthians 12; 1 Corinthians 13; 1 Corinthians 14.

   In Paul's time some ignored and sneered at gifts, while others thought
   them to be everything, especially the showy gifts, like speaking with
   tongues. The apostle teaches that the possession of a gift makes a
   believer a doubter to others, and he mentions nine gifts of the Spirit.
   Gifts like healing, miracles and tongues, we believe were sign gifts (2
   Corinthians 12:12) to prove to the world that Jesus was the true
   Messiah, and that the apostles were His divinely appointed
   representatives. These are retired now, for although we hear of some
   speaking with tongues, the divine accompaniments of the rushing mighty
   wind, the cloven tongues of fire, and foreigners hearing the gospel
   preached in their own language, are lacking, and in 1 Corinthians
   14:19; the apostle warn against the over-emphasis of the gift of
   tongues. Before the New Testament was completed miracles and signs were
   given to commend the apostles and their preaching. Since then we have
   had no more miracles, nor prophecies, nor visions, nor coming of
   angels. Man is to believe, to trust, to walk by faith. We must covet
   earnestly the best gifts, the spiritual gifts of wisdom, knowledge and
   faith, 1 Corinthians 12:31. Also these gifts must be used in love, 1
   Corinthians 13.

  Great Facts VI. The Resurrection of the Body.

   1 Corinthians 15.

   Some members of the church doubted the resurrection of the body, but
   this denial made of no effect the greatest truths of the gospel. It
   made preaching, faith, and hope all vain. In fact, no resurrection
   meant no gospel. The apostle, therefore gives the many proofs of
   Christ's resurrection, 1 Corinthians 15:4-9 ; then the order of events.
    1. Christ's resurrection.
    2. His second coming 1 Corinthians 15:23.
    3. Resurrection of believers.
    4. Overthrow of Christ's enemies and His glorious reign, 1 Corinthians
       15:24-25.

   Also we shall leave behind. our material bodies and be given spiritual
   bodies which are fitted for a spiritual state. These will resemble the
   old bodies in appearance, but without defects, and with new powers and
   new glories.

   WRITER--Paul,

   DATE 57 A. D. A few months after the first epistle.

   PLACE OF WRITING--Probably Phillipi.

   OCCASION--After Paul had sent the First Epistle condemning the church
   for its lack of discipline, he was in great anxiety because of the
   state of the church, and as to how they would receive his recent
   rebukes. He,- therefore, sent Titus to Corinth to find out the effect
   of his epistle. While Paul was at Phillipi on his third missionary
   journey, Titus brought back the good news that the First Epistle had
   been received in the right spirit, and the offenders had been promptly
   dealt with. Paul was so thankful for the encouraging news that he wrote
   the Second Epistle.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To express the comfort their repentance had given him.
    2. To urge a collection for famine stricken Christians in Palestine.
    3. To defend his right as an apostle.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Ministry.
    2. Collection.
    3. Defence.

  Great Fact: I. Paul's Faithful Ministry.

   2 Corinthians 1; 2 Corinthians 2; 2 Corinthians 3; 2 Corinthians 4;
   2 Corinthians 5; 2 Corinthians 6; 2 Corinthians 7.

   In 2 Corinthians 1; Paul declares that he has a clear conscience as to
   his sincerity and faithfulness while labouring among them, and explains
   that he has sent his first epistle instead of visiting them in order
   that when he did come he might be able to praise and not to scold them.
   In 2 Corinthians 2; he begs the church to forgive the noted offender
   who has repented, in order that Satan may take no advantage of the
   affair. In 2 Corinthians 3; he declares that he needs no letters of
   commendation, for the church at Corinth. In his letter of commendation,
   a letter written not with ink upon paper, but with the Spirit upon
   Christian hearts. In 2 Corinthians 4; he declares that his ministry was
   honest, and the gospel message understandable to those who were
   spiritually capable of receiving it. He suffered much in his ministry,
   but was optimistic because afflictions here will increase our glory
   yonder. In 2 Corinthians 5; he finds comfort in the thought that our
   suffering bodies will soon be exchanged for bodies of painless glory,
   therefore, whether we live or die we should keep the judgement of
   reward in view. As Christ's ambassador he besought men to be reconciled
   to God. In 2 Corinthians 6; he appeals to his fellow workers not to
   receive God's loving kindness in vain, also to open their hearts to
   him, and to prove their love by separating themselves from unbelievers.
   In 2 Corinthians 7; he tells of his anxiety while waiting for a report
   from them by Titus. He notes that they were at first grieved by his
   sharp letter, but afterward followed his counsel and stood firm for the
   truth. Thus Godly sorrow leads to repentance and brings salvation,
   which one will never regret he possessed.

   LESSONS:--

   1. When in trouble we should find comfort, not in forgetfulness or in
   dissipation, or in complaining, but in the God of all comfort, for all
   true comfort conies from Him. Then as with Paul, the comforted shall
   become comforters.

   All though Paul had to say severe things to his friends at Corinth, yet
   he was not blind to their good qualities, but praised them at every
   opportunity and never disparaged them to outsiders. If we wish
   friendship to last, and stand the strains to which all human ties are
   subject, we must never forget this rule: "Praise somewhat!"

  Great Fact II. The Collection for Famine-Stricken Christians.

   2 Corinthians 8; 2 Corinthians 9.

   In 2 Corinthians 8; Paul reminds the brethren at Corinth of the
   liberality of the Macedonian churches to the Palestine famine fund.
   Although poor they begged an opportunity to give, and gave beyond their
   power, because they first gave themselves to the Lord. He therefore
   urges the Corinthians to excel not only in faith, teaching and
   earnestness but also in the spiritual gift of giving, following the
   example of our Lord, 2 Corinthians 8; 2 Corinthians 9. They were the
   first to start the offering for their Jewish brothers, now they are
   asked to complete it that Paul's praise of them to the other churches
   may be justified. Let each one give, not grudgingly, but cheerfully and
   liberally, and God will enrich with spiritual graces, and material
   supplies to repay gifts made to Him. These gifts will strengthen the
   ties of brotherhood between the Jewish and Gentile Christians. Thanks
   be unto God for His unspeakable gift!

   LESSONS--The Macedonian churches, were shining examples in the grace of
   giving, for:--
    1. They gave out of deep poverty, 2 Corinthians 8:2.
    2. They gave largely, 2 Corinthians 8:3.
    3. They gave spontaneously, of their own accord, without being begged,
       2 Corinthians 8:3.
    4. They counted it a privilege to give, and gave with much joy, 2
       Corinthians 8:4; and
    5. All this was because they first gave their own selves to the Lord.

   An earnest Christian says, "Four years ago I was to spend the day in a
   large city. Before starting I said to my invalid sister now in glory,
   Can I buy anything for you, dear? I do want so much to bring you
   something from the city.' With a look full of meaning, she said,
   Nothing, dear. Do not bring anything. I only want you. Come home as
   soon as you can!'" This is what the Saviour desires. He knows that if
   He gets our love, He gets ourselves and our service. The important
   problems of tithing and stewardship will be solved when we first give
   our own selves unto the Lord.

  Great Facts III. Paul's DEFENCE of His Apostleship.

   2 Corinthians 10; 2 Corinthians 11; 2 Corinthians 12; 2 Corinthians 13;
   2 Corinthians 14.

   A minority of Judaizing Christians in the church accused Paul of being
   bold toward them in his letters, but cowardly with them in person. They
   said that he was no apostle because he worked with his own hands to
   support himself, and did not live on the gospel as did the other
   apostles. Paul replies that if false teachers boast of their power and
   authority, even while seeking to put them under the bondage of the Law,
   he, therefore, will boast somewhat, and show that he is ahead of them
   all because of his countless sufferings on land and sea. Yea, his very
   sacrifices and successes prove his apostleship. Besides all this, the
   Lord had given him marvellous visions and revelations, indeed he was
   caught up into paradise and heard things that could not be put into
   speech, 2 Corinthians 12:4. It was because of these exalted experiences
   that he had a thorn in the flesh, 2 Corinthians 12:7. He did not want
   to boast but to show that he had wrought all the mighty deeds of an
   apostle. 2 Corinthians 12:12. He would yet come to them a third time
   and would not spare those who were impenitent or who opposed the
   gospel, 2 Corinthians 13:2.

   LESSONS:--
    1. Paul was a highly gifted man but he did not rely upon his personal
       ability for his apostolic authority. Also he and the other apostles
       declared again and again that they did not receive their
       commissions from man but from the Lord. He convinced his opponents
       that he was truly an apostle because he had seen Jesus, 1
       Corinthians 9; 2 Corinthians 10; 2 Corinthians 11. Had received a
       call to the work of an apostle, 1 Corinthians 1:1, and could point
       to the signs and seals of his apostleship, 2 Corinthians 12:12. The
       other apostles perceiving the grace that was given him, recognized
       Paul as apostle to the Gentiles and gave him the right hand o
       fellowship, Galatians 2:9.
    2. Paul's thorn in the flesh is thought to have been chronic eye
       trouble that made him look contemptible to others. What it actually
       was, however, is not stated, in order that the grace sufficient
       which he received, may avail for all to whom ANY thorn is given.
    3. God always hears the prayers of faith, but sometimes answers "No,"
       because He sees we will be better off with the thorn than without
       it. Who knows the sins and failures we are saved from by a warning
       thorn? Perhaps no verse in Scripture has brought more strength and
       comfort than 2 Corinthians 12:9. The sufficiency of divine grace
       was the great comfort of Paul in times of weakness, hardship and
       danger. So with us, for unusual tasks we are given unusual
       strength, for unusual suffering we are given unusual patience. Ills
       grace is always sufficient!

   The cross is not greater than His grace,
   The cross cannot hide His blessed face!
   I am satisfied to know that with Jesus here below,
   I can conquer every foe,
   With His grace!

              Lesson No. 49--Have An Open Bible and An Open Heart

LESSON THEME:--GALATIANS

   Galatians 5:22-26.
     * KEY WORD--"LIBERTY."
     * KEY VERSE,--Galatians 5:1.
     * KEY PHRASE--"FREEDOM FROM WORKS AND CEREMONIES."

   Home Readings.

   Galatians settles forever that man is free from the Law. Read a chapter
   a day this week, and for family altar read:
     * Sunday--He who perverts the gospel must expect a curse,--Galatians
       1:1-9.
     * Monday--Keeping the ceremonial law is unnecessary,--Galatians
       2:11-21.
     * Tuesday--The law should direct men to Christ,--Galatians 3:19-29.
     * Wednesday--Do not go back to a formal religion,--Galatians 4:1-14.
     * Thursday--Stand fast in Christian liberty,--Galatians 5:1-13.
     * Friday--Works of flesh versus fruits of Spirit,--Galatians 5:1-13.
     * Saturday--Be kind and spiritual, Galatians 6:10.

   WRITER--Paul. DATE--Probably 57 A. D. from Corinth.

   THECOUNTRY--Galatia was a province of the Roman empire in Asia Minor,
   and derived its name from the Gaul or Celtic tribes who settled it 279
   B. C. The people were impulsive and quick to receive impressions, so
   that they gave an enthusiastic welcome to Paul on his second missionary
   journey, and eagerly embraced Christianity, but were soon led away by
   false teachers.

   THECHURCHES--This letter is addressed to the churches of Derbe, Lystra,
   Iconium, and Antioch in Pesidia, which were in the province of Galatia.
   Remember that Antioch in Pesidia was 300 miles northwest of the great
   missionary church at Antioch.

   OCCASIONOFTHEEPISTLE--Semi-Christian Jewish teachers were claiming that
   even if Christianity were true, Christians should be circumcised, and
   do all the works of the Law. The reason Paul did not teach this, these
   false teachers urged, was because he was not a true apostle and had
   learned his doctrines from others.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To trace Paul's gospel back to God Himself.
    2. To show that the believer is free from the Law and is saved by
       faith alone.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Teaching.
    2. Contrasts.
    3. Freedom.

  Great Facts I. Paul's Teaching Was Authorized by God Himself.

   Galatians 1; Galatians 2.

   Paul marvels that his recent converts should so quickly give up the
   gospel of freedom, and take up with a Jewish message that was no gospel
   at all. If an angel from heaven were to preach any gospel other than
   that Paul preached he would be accursed. To prove that Paul's
   apostleship and gospel were of divine origin he urges the following
   facts:
    1. Only God could have changed him from a bitter Pharisee to an humble
       preacher of the gospel.
    2. He did not consult men as to what he should preach, but retired to
       Arabia for three years and there consulted with God.
    3. He was with Peter and James but fifteen days so could not have
       learned much from them.
    4. When he went to the church council at Jerusalem, the apostles added
       nothing to his message, but gave him the right hand of fellowship
       into the company of the apostles and approved his message.
    5. To show that Peter was not a greater apostle than he, he points out
       how he had openly rebuked Peter for being two-faced about Jewish
       customs. This proves he was not dominated by Peter's teaching.

   LESSON:--

   1. Just as the Galatians were urged to supplant Paul with Peter, when
   in reality they both stood for the same Christ and the same gospel, so
   today unwise voices cry, down with this leader and up with another to
   the injury of the common cause. If a church or denomination instead of
   unitedly rallying around Christ breaks up into different parties, then
   the tempter blights the influence of all the parties concerned.

   2. Perverters of religion did not die out with the Galatians. They are
   a type of those who worship Christ plus somebody else! Who believe the
   Bible plus the keys or decrees of man! Who are trusting their salvation
   to faith plus ordinances or masses or penances! The wonder Of all
   wonders is that any man would give up a gospel of freedom and faith for
   a religion of tyranny and works.

  Great Facts II. Contrasts Between Law and Grace.

   Galatians 3; Galatians 4.

   Here the apostle reminds them that they received the Spirit not as a
   result of obedience to Law, but because they heard the gospel with
   faith. Not the circumcised, but those whose lives are based on faith
   are the true sons of Abraham. The Law cannot give righteousness, but it
   does curse all who do not keep everything in it God's covenant of faith
   with Abraham was not made of none effect by the Law given 430 years
   afterward. If the Law cannot give the Spirit, nor righteousness, nor a
   blessing, nor affect the faith-covenant with Abraham, of what use is
   it? To show man his guilt, and to direct him to Christ! Hence all
   distinctions between Jew and Gentile, rich and poor, male and female
   have vanished, for all are one in union with Christ Jesus. As long as
   the heir is under age there is no difference between him and a slave
   for he is subject to the control of guardians. So with us, we are under
   the trifling, childish teachings of this world, but since Christ came
   to ransom us, we are no longer slaves, but possess all the privileges
   of full-grown sons and heirs. Paul reminds them that they welcomed him
   as if he had been an angel of God, or even the Lord Himself! And how
   they would have torn out their own eyes and given them to him. Now he
   wants to be assured that they are as loyal to the gospel of grace as
   when they first received it! Illustrating again their exalted state as
   freeman in Christ he reminds them that Abraham had two sons, one
   Ishmael, the child of Hagar, the slave, and the other Isaac, the child
   of Sarah, the free woman. Ishmael enjoyed not the blessings of
   Abraham's house but was cast out, so must it be with those who seek to
   be saved by keeping the Law. But as Isaac was the child of promise, so
   ye all who become sons through faith in Christ, are heirs of spiritual
   promise.

   LESSON--Notice the remarkable contrasts.
    1. Grace vs. Law. Under Grace God graciously bestows salvation, but
       the law demands that we should deserve it.
    2. Faith vs. works. Through faith we trustingly receive salvation, but
       works would keep us ever feverishly seeking to earn it.
    3. Spirit vs. flesh. Living in the Spirit gives one daily victory over
       sin, but walking after the flesh makes one ever prone to sin.
    4. Cross vs. world. The principles of the Cross are those of love,
       sacrifice and consecration, but those of the world are force,
       selfishness and pleasure.

   One never saw a woman sewing without a needle. She would make but poor
   speed if she sewed with only the thread. So when God is dealing with
   us, he puts in the needle of the Law first, for the fact is that we
   sleep so soundly that we need to be awakened by something sharp. But
   when He has the needle of the Law fairly into our hearts, then He draws
   a life-long thread of Gospel love and peace and joy!

  Great Facts III. Freedom From Works and the Flesh.

   Galatians 5; Galatians 6.

   Paul beseeches the Galatians to hold fast to their gospel liberty, for
   if they seek to be saved by keeping a part of the Law, that binds them
   to keep the whole Law. As Christ's freemen they ran such a splendid
   race, why be hindered? If they are so anxious to keep Law then love one
   another, for this is the summing up of the whole Law. Not only so but
   free yourselves from the cravings of your earthly nature, for these
   result in seventeen evil works, Galatians 5:19. Far better it is to
   yield the nine-fold fruits of the Spirit, Galatians 5:11-23. He that
   soweth to the Spirit will reap spiritual harvest, but he who sows to
   the lower appetites will reap moral weakness and suffering, Galatians
   6:7-8. Show a gentle spirit to one caught committing a sin, remembering
   that you also may be tempted, Galatians 6:1. False teachers glory in
   the number of their converts, but God forbid that I should glory save
   in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ!Galatians 6:12-14.

   LESSON--The commonest fault of Christians is, that when converted, they
   do not cut loose from old habits, unscriptural beliefs and unscriptural
   friends. They are like two drunken men who one night went down to where
   their boat was tied and sought to return home. They got in and began to
   row, but when morning dawned they saw that they had never loosed the
   mooring line nor raised the anchor. That is just the way with many who
   would like to grow in grace. They get into the good boat "Conversion."
   but they never let the Spirit pull up the flesh anchor, and the world
   and the devil have pretty strong lines upon them. To consciously
   realize the abiding presence of the Spirit gives the believer a
   victorious life, Galatians 5:16, creates Christian character, Galatians
   5:22, inspires prayer, Ephesians 6:18, helps our weakness, Romans 8:26,
   and makes real the rights, privileges and wealth of sonship, Galatians
   6:6-7.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATEandPLACE--62 A. D. during the first imprisonment at Rome. He wrote
   at the same time Philemon, Colossians and Philippians. These four are
   known as the Prison Epistles.

   EPHESUS was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and was famous
   for the beautiful temple of Diana which was one of the seven wonders of
   the world. Also for the theatre which would seat 50,000 and was the
   largest ever built by the Greeks. To it rushed the mob that had seized
   Paul, Acts 19:29. The city also possessed a great stadium or circus
   where men fought with wild beasts, 1 Corinthians 16:32.

  Great Fact I. The Believer's Position in Christ.

   Ephesians 1; Ephesians 2.

   We have here the saint's inheritance in the Land of Promise, or the
   spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us in heavenly things,
   (not places) in Christ. There are at least nine blessings unfolded in
   this section for the believer who is in union with Christ through
   faith. He is:
    1. Chosen in Christ to be holy and blameless, Ephesians 1:4. In the
       remote ages of past eternity God was thinking about us, loving us
       and planning to bless us. Before Satan ever appeared to spoil the
       innocence and happiness of earth, God laid plans to make all who
       should believe in Christ to be holy and blameless.
    2. Prepared for adoption to Himself, Ephesians 1:5. We become children
       of God by the new birth, but we enter immediately upon all the
       privileges of full-grown sons by God's act of adoption.
    3. Redeemed from the bondage of sin, Ephesians 1:4. By nature man
       belongs to sin and Satan, death and hell, but Christ with the
       infinite price of His own blood has released us from these things.
    4. Given insight into the will and ways of God, Ephesians 1:9. The
       world knows nothing of God's ways with man in the past or in the
       future, but Goa opens up His secret things to the believer.
    5. Sealed by the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 1:15. God stamps upon man's
       spirit all the blessed traits of the Holy Spirit, love, joy, peace,
       etc.
    6. Made alive through Christ, Ephesians 2:5. It takes half a dozen
       pallbearers to carry a dead man, but alive man can carry himself
       and somebody else besides. Christ's life throbbing in the heart,
       makes us alive to enjoy everything from God and to do everything
       for God.
    7. Raised to the realm of heavenly things, Ephesians 2:6. When we are
       born again, we share the resurrection privileges of Christ, and as
       we grow in grace we share the ascension privileges of Christ. We
       rise above the trials, temptations and fascinations of the world,
       and have a joyful experience in heavenly things that this world can
       never afford.
    8. Brought nigh by the blood, Ephesians 2:13. We were as prodigals in
       the far country, away from Christ and the right to heaven. The
       blood of Christ, however, has brought the believe-: into the
       covenant, into precious nearness to Christ, and into eternal
       nearness hereafter.
    9. The believer, whether Jew or Gentile, is made part of the one
       glorious church, Ephesians 2:21. The church is Christ's body, and
       all true believers are joint-members of the body, but note
       carefully that:
         1. Christ, and He alone, is the Head of the body.
         2. He was also the foundation of it.
         3. The church should be a holy and growing thing.
         4. When completed it will exhibit the manifold glory of God.

   LESSON--We may come to this wonderful epistle as some go shopping. They
   will go into a store that has a hundred thousand dollars' worth of
   goods, buy a packet of pins and walk out; that is what they went for.
   Rather let us become the happy possessor of all the blessed spiritual
   truths in the storehouse of God's grace.

  Great Fact II A Mystery of God Revealed.

   Ephesians 3.

   Paul here tells how God held back from other generations the secret
   that the Gentiles should be heirs of and shareholders in the gospel,
   and have free admission to the church on equal terms with the Jews,
   whether in heaven or on earth as forming one family and deriving its
   name from God, Ephesians 3:15. The petitions of Paul's exalted prayers
   are four:
    1. To be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man.
    2. To have Christ dwelling in the heart by faith.
    3. With all saints to understand the breadth and length, the depth and
       the height of the love Of Christ.
    4. To be filled with all the fullness of God.

  Great Facts III. Appeals for Godliness.

   Ephesians 4 to Ephesians 5:20.

   Paul here entreats us to walk worthily of our heavenly citizenship, to
   be humble, gentle and patient, and to keep the seven unities of the
   Spirit. These are one church, lone Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one
   faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all. Use the spiritual gifts
   that the acceded Christ bequeathed to the church and thus attain ideal
   spiritual manhood. Lay aside like an old garment the old life, and put
   on like a new garment the new life. Let all bitterness, passion, anger,
   malice and harsh language be banished from among you, and be kind to
   one another, tender hearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God
   for Christ's sake forgave you. Have nothing to do with deeds of
   darkness for you are children of light and should live in the open.
   Arise from spiritual death, and Christ shall give you light. Make the
   most of every opportunity for good. Find exhilaration not in wine but
   in the power of the Spirit. Sing and make music in your hearts to the
   Lord, and always give thanks for everything.

   LESSON--Godliness is having the heart and eye turned towards God until
   we become like God. We should have Godly fear, Godly sincerity and
   Godly zeal and Godly compassion. Every created thing has its bounds,
   but Godliness has none. God's wells can never be too full of water. The
   tree of righteousness cannot bear too many fruits of the Spirit.
   Godliness with contentment is great gain.

  Great Facts IV. Domestic Life Should Be Spiritual.

   Ephesians 5:21 to Ephesians 6:9.

   Let wives acknowledge the headship of their husbands, even as the
   church acknowledges the headship of Christ. Let the husbands serve
   their wives, and love them as they love themselves, for Christ loved
   the church and gave Himself for it to purchase, cleanse and make it
   perfect. Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord, for this
   is but right, besides it will mean long life and prosperity. Servants,
   always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you.
   Give your se.-vice heartily and cheerfully as it working for the divine
   Master, for everyone will be rewarded by this Master for any honest
   work he has done. Masters, show the right spirit to your servants, and
   do not threaten them, for both your Master and theirs is in Heaven, and
   before Him there is no distinction of rank.

   LESSON--No man can love his wife too much unless he loves her more than
   Christ loves the church. No wife can have the home too spiritual for if
   many a husband is to get to heaven, he must be helped through the
   gracious life of the wife. The Christian family is the cradle and
   protection of the Christian faith. Parents, lead your boys and girls to
   Jesus. Children, obey to succeed.

  Great Facts V. The Christian Life Is a Warfare.

   Ephesians 6:10-24.

   Find strength in your union with the Lord, and in the power of His
   might, for life is a campaign against the various powers of evil that
   hold sway in the darkness around us, against the spirits of wickedness
   in the air. Therefore, as spiritual soldiers put on the whole armour of
   God, with your breastplate, and the shoes of Peace. In every battle
   take up Faith for your shield, for this will protect you from the fiery
   depths of the Evil one. Let the hope of Complete Sanctification be your
   helmet, and for a sword use the Word of God.

   LESSONS:--
    1. Armour is God's, not ours.
    2. We are to put it on.
    3. We are to put on the whole of it.
    4. The results of putting it on are security, comfort, victory.
    5. No armour is provided for the back, showing that the Christian
       soldier was not meant to run from his enemies.

   Fight the good fight with all thy might. Christ is thy strength and
   Christ thy light; Lay hold on life and it shall be;

   Thy joy and crown eternally.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATEandPLACE--62 A. D., during his first imprisonment at Rome.

   PHILLIPI was named after Phillip II. king of Macedonia, and father of
   Alexander the Great. It is famous in Roman history as the place of the
   defeat of the republic and the rise of the empire, 42 B. C. A spirit is
   supposed to have appeared to Brutus, the leader of the republican army,
   and said to him, "I am thy evil genius, we will meet again at
   Phillip'!"

   It will be always famous also for Paul's imprisonment, the earthquake
   and the conversion of the Phillipian jailer. It was here that the first
   church in Europe was set up by Paul in 62 A. D. Acts 16:12-32.

   THE CHURCH was founded by Paul on his second missionary journey, and
   seems to have been free from Jewish troubles, and the errors in
   doctrine, that so endangered most of the other churches. Indeed, it was
   Paul's favourite church, ever showing their loyalty to him and their
   affection for him by messages of love and mission offerings.

   OCCASION--The church had sent Paul a contribution for his support while
   in prison and unable to provide for himself. The bearer of the gift,
   Epaphroditus, was taken dangerously sick at Rome, but having recovered
   and being about to return home, Paul takes the opportunity of writing
   this letter to the noble church.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To express Paul's Christian love to the church for their devotion
       to him.
    2. To exhort them to press toward the mark of high Christian
       character, and to sound the depths of real Christian joy.

GREAT FACTS:--

   Rejoicing in Christ:--
    1. Life.
    2. Example.
    3. Righteousness.
    4. Strength.

  Great Facts I. Rejoicing in Christ's Life.

   Philippians 1.

   Paul first assures the church that every recollection he has of them is
   a cause of gratitude, and that the good work done in them would go on
   until it was perfected. He prays that of excellent things they may
   choose the best, and that they may bear a rich harvest of
   righteousness. He tells them that although he is in prison and chained
   to a soldier, yet the people gather to hear him preach, and even the
   guards were so interested in the gospel that they spread the message
   around. This encouraged other Christians to preach the gospel
   fearlessly. Some, however, with envy in their hearts, preached
   deceitfully, hoping to add to Paul's sorrows, but he rejoices that
   Christ is preached, whether by his enemies or by his friends. He is
   determined to magnify Christ, either with his restored liberty or by
   his death. To live is to work FOR Christ, to die is to be WITH Christ.
   He would rather die than live, but he would rather live than die before
   his work was done.

   LESSON--To some, both life and death have seemed like evils, but to the
   apostle they are both supreme blessings, and he knew not which to
   choose. In spite of his hardships he was willing still to be a living
   sacrifice, for the sacrifice of the life is more noble, more heroic,
   and more divine than the sacrifice of the death. This was the secret of
   Paul's life, which made him the greatest apostle and missionary of all
   time. As some men lose themselves in a great ambition or a great art,
   so he lost himself in Christ. He saw God's purposes as Christ did. He
   magnified God's grace as Christ did. He had Christ's virtues, Christ's
   vision, Christ's strength, and Christ's spirit. Oh, that the virtues
   and spirit of Christ may breathe out from our lives, then we, too,
   shall be more noble, more heroic, more divine.

    Great Facts II. Rejoicing in Christ's Example.

   Philippians 2.

   Paul here exhorts the church to make his happiness complete by living
   together in unity, love, humility and unselfishness, bearing in mind
   the example of Christ, who although He was equal with the Father, yet
   emptied Himself of His heavenly' glory and in a seven-fold way humbled
   Himself, Philippians 2:5-8. Therefore God highly exalted Him in His
   resurrection and ascension and appointed that every tongue should
   confess Him to the glory of the Father. Man must work out his own
   salvation, for it is absolutely a personal matter, and one cannot
   repent, believe and love for another. Further, man must seem to enjoy
   the experience, and yield the fruits of a FULL salvation for God is
   working in us to that end. Following the example of Christ still, we
   should not complain or dispute, but rather be blameless and pure in the
   midst of an evil-disposed world. If the church will make such
   scriptural progress, then Paul will count it a great joy to have poured
   out his life-blood for them.

   LESSON--If our lives would at all approach the blessed example of
   Christ we must:
    1. Empty ourselves of honours and gains that may be fairly ours. "Our
       richest gains we must count but loss and pour contempt on all our
       pride!"
    2. We must imitate Him who. although Lord of all, became the servant
       to all!
    3. We must become obedient even unto death. Christ to be obedient laid
       aside omnipotence and took upon Himself our human frailties, He
       exchanged His glory throne for an awful cross, surely "Love so
       amazing. So divine, demands my life, my soul, my all!" Then, as
       with Christ, humiliation shall soon be followed by exaltation, if
       we share His cross we shall also share His throne.

  Great Facts III. Rejoicing in Christ's Righteousness, Fellowship and Coming.

   Philippians 3.

   Paul here warns the church of the Judaizers who make so much of the
   circumcision. He affirms that the real circumcision are those who live
   a spiritual religion and look only to Christ for deliverance from sin.
   When it comes to boasting of lineage and pedigree, He outranks them
   all, yet He counts all natural honours and privileges as trash compared
   with the exceeding value of a personal and saving knowledge of Christ
   Jesus. He would lose everything to gain Christ, he would turn his back
   upon the Law and its righteousness. if only he might he clothed in
   Christ's righteousness. Then indeed he would know Christ fully and the
   power of His resurrection. Not that he had attained to the resurrection
   from the dead, neither was he perfect with the perfection of heaven,
   but he was stretching every power of his soul to reach the goal of
   spiritual excellence. Let all mature Christians have this spiritual
   ambition and not follow those who are enemies of the Cross, and live
   only to satisfy their earthly appetites. For our citizenship is in
   heaven, therefore we should live as heavenly citizens, ever looking for
   Christ's coming, when He will change these bodies of humiliation into
   bodies of glory like unto His own.

   LESSON--Just as a sailor will throw his precious cargo overboard in
   order to save the ship and his life, so must we throw overboard all
   trust in our own righteousness in order to gain Christ. We may have
   come of a good family and of a religious stood. May have always
   attended Sunday school and church, and always had good moral
   principles. Yet Paul here agrees with Isaiah in declaring that "All our
   own righteousness is as filthy rags." The supreme thing is to place
   entire dependence in the righteousness of Christ, and to seek to gain
   it, not by tears, or work, or gift, but by repentant faith.

  Great Facts IV. Rejoicing in Christ's Strength.

   Philippians 4.

   Paul prays that the Christian may have joy at all times in union with
   his Lord, and not to be weakened by worry but to carry everything to
   God in prayer. Then the peace of God, surpassing all thought will stand
   guard over our hearts and minds. Be careful of your thoughts,
   where-ever you find anything true or honourable, pure or virtuous, then
   meditate on these things. He rejoiced in their gift to him, not because
   he was in want, for he had learned the secret of contentment in all
   circumstances. In all human experiences he could do all things in the
   strength of Him who makes strong. Their gifts, however, were a fragrant
   and acceptable sacrifice unto God, and as they had supplied his need
   God would supply all their needs according to His riches in glory in
   Christ Jesus.

   LESSON--Here is a beautiful picture of the omnipotence of the
   Christian. In Christ's strength he is:--
    1. Able to undergo every trial.
    2. Brave every suffering.
    3. Overcome every temptation.
    4. Perform every duty.

   If therefore strength is available, then there is no excuse for
   weakness. He who protects the young birds in their warm nests and
   braces the oak tree to wrestle with the storm, will either hide His own
   in the cleft or the rock until the storm passes, or give them strength
   to bravely conquer the storm out in the open. The infant, fostered by
   his mother, will soon become strong and useful; the saplings, fostered
   by the gardener, will soon become fruitful. How much more then shall
   the believer, blessed and strengthened by Christ, abound, be fruitful,
   and triumph over every obstacle!

   WRITER--Paul. DATE and PLACE of writing, 62 A. D., during his first
   imprisonment at Rome.

   COLOSSAE was the third-rate town in size, situated about 100 miles east
   of Ephesus in Asia Minor.

   THE CHURCH was probably founded by Epaphras, Colossians 1:7, although
   Paul kept in close touch with the people, and was known and loved by
   the people.

   OCCASION--Epaphras went to Rome to advise with Paul concerning the
   errors that were creeping into the church. The false prophets argued:--
    1. That God is pure and good, but that matter is evil, therefore the
       world could not have come from God. This wrong theory of matter
       prevails in Christian Science today.
    2. Therefore, they argued, there must be different degrees of angels,
       who created us, so we should worship angels. Angel worship is still
       acknowledged in the Roman catechism.
    3. The only way to give our bodies is to discipline them with
       penances. This is still practiced by Catholics.
    4. They made too much of ceremonies, ordinances and fast days, a
       serious error of Catholicism. These false teachings placed Christ
       in the background, and denied His headship, so to combat them, Paul
       sent this letter back to Epaphras.

   PURPOSE--To exalt the person of Christ, and to teach that He is the
   Creator of the universe and the supreme Head of the church and of all
   things.

GREAT FACTS:

    1. Pre-Eminence.
    2. False
    3. Teaching.
    4. Graces.

  Great Facts I. The Pre-Eminence of Christ.

   Colossians 1.

   Paul first thanks the Father for their faith in Christ, their love for
   the saints. and their hope laid up in heaven, Colossians 1:1-8. He then
   prays that they may experience a deeper insight into spiritual truth,
   may live lives worthy of the Master, and he fruitful in every kind of
   good deed, Colossians 1:9-14. He next glowingly describes Christ's
   seven superiorities over all other created beings.
    1. He is the exact likeness of the unseen God.
    2. He existed before all creation.
    3. He was the producer of all creation.
    4. All things were created by Him.
    5. He is the supreme authority over the church in all matters.
    6. He is the Bringer-forth of the dead.
    7. In Him all the fullness of the divine nature dwells.

   Not only is He superior in His blessed person, but also in His saving
   work, for He has made peace through the shedding of His blood offered
   on the Cross, and by this sacrifice reconciled all believers to God,
   Colossians 1:20-23. Paul rejoices that he could suffer for Christ, and
   preach to the Gentiles the truth hidden from former generations, that
   Christ is in us, the Hope of glory, Colossians 1:24-29.

   LESSON--
    1. If it is Christ's glory to be the exact likeness of God, then It
       should be our glory to be the exact likeness of Christ in
       knowledge, Colossians 3:10; in holiness and righteousness,
       Ephesians 4:24. We were predestined to be conformed to the image of
       His Son, Romans 8:29.
    2. If Christ made saints and angels then we should worship Him and not
       them.
    3. The fullness of Christ's wisdom will keep us from error, the
       fullness of his grace will subdue our sins, the fullness of His
       mercy will succour us In trouble, the fullness of His joy will de-
       light our souls with fatness, Colossians 1:19.

  Great Facts II. Warning Against False Teachings.

   Colossians 2.

   Paul here longs for the Christians to keep in view the full blessedness
   of firm conviction and to strive for a perfect knowledge of God's
   truth, so than no shrewd false teacher should deceive them. The
   Gnostics, (so called because they claimed to know the doctrines of
   Christ, hut in reality were mixing Greek philosophy with Christianity)
   taught that Christ was only one of the mediums of communication between
   God and man. On the contrary, He is the Head of all spiritual and human
   beings, the almighty Deliverer from sin's tyranny, and when He died on
   the cross He put the powers of evil to open contempt, Colossians 1:15.
   The believer should remember that he is emancipated from all ordinances
   of the Law, and need not keep fast days, for undue self-denial does not
   curb the lower appetites or passions, Colossians 2:21-23. Let none
   trick you into the worship of angels, but rather be ruled by the Head
   of the church who will nourish you, so that you may grow with a divine
   growth, Colossians 2:18-19.

   LESSON--
    1. Whoever robs Christ of His pre-eminences and glory robs us of our
       salvation. By so much as His position is lowered and His fullness
       diminished, by so much is our spiritual life imperilled and
       impaired. Whatever is taken away from the completeness of His
       person and the sufficiency of His meditation, is taken away at the
       same time from our assurance of pardon, from the ground of our
       faith, from our motive of holiness and from the certainty of our
       heavenly prize. He does not share with others the blessed work of
       saving and keeping the believer. Nay, neither angels, nor saints,
       nor virgins, nor prophets, nor martyrs rank with Him, for He is the
       very embodiment of the divine fullness.
    2. There Is nothing religious in punishing the body, or in denying it
       necessary food, or in arraying it in uncomfortable clothes as the
       ascetics have done and do now. The sacrifice of God is a broken
       spirit and not a weakened body; a corrupt heart often dwells in a
       .fasting body.
    3. All Jewish feasts and sacred days were connected with the shadowy
       Law. From the shadow the Christian turns to Christ the substance,
       and observes and enjoys only the gospel realities.

  Great Facts III. The Old Nature vs. The Graces of the New Life.

   Colossians 3; Colossians 4.

   The apostle here pleads that old nature should be destroyed together
   with all its vices, such as immorality, impurity, passion, greed,
   malice, slander, and unworthy talk. In their place we should put on as
   a new garment the graces of the new life such as tenderness of heart,
   kindliness, humility, patience, forgiveness and love. By practicing
   these things we are living as heavenly citizens in a spiritual realm,
   rooted indeed in Christ! In the Christian family, wives should submit
   lovingly to their husbands, and husbands should never be harsh with
   their wives. Children should obey their parents in everything, for that
   is pleasing to the Lord. Fathers should never irritate their children
   lest they become disheartened. Servants should render all service with
   honesty of heart, and masters should do what is right and fair by their
   servants. We should persevere in prayer, praying particularly that God
   will open a door for the gospel. Be cautious in dealing with
   unchristian men. Buy up the time for doing good. Our conversation
   should always be kindly.

   LESSON--
    1. The destruction of the old nature is a gradual process. There will
       be remains of the old life, but it should not be in power, but
       should be crucified daily.
    2. Sin does not die out itself, we must kill it with the help of the
       Spirit. In the past we were delivered from the guilt of sin, in the
       present we should be delivered from the power of sin, and in the
       future we shall be delivered from the presence of sin.
    3. The graces of the new life include a new nature for we are born
       from above. Also a new citizenship for we should have heavenly
       ideals. Also new conduct for we should be emancipated from old
       failures, and grow out of old faults. Mr. Burbank succeeded in
       raising out of a wild field daisy a blossom five to seven inches in
       diameter, and a poppy so increased in size that it measures ten
       inches across its brilliant bloom. So with our graces, we need
       corresponding enlargements. Too often, they are starved and meagre.
       Too often the fruits of the Spirit are as small wild fruit as grown
       in the woods. Man's highest action is to reach up higher. Trees
       cannot grow up into the Sky, but they can grow up towards it. As
       life is unceasing change, let it be from good to better, and from
       better to best. The old nature should die, let it die. The graces
       of the new life should abound more and more unto the perfect day.
       Our life-long ambition should be to master every sin and to possess
       and practice every virtue.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATE--About 52 A. D. from Corinth.

   THESSALONICA, whose modern name is Salonica, was a commercial centre
   about 100 miles west of Phillip,. Paul visited it on his second
   missionary Journey, and finding a synagogue of the Jews there, preached
   on three successive Sabbaths, when quite a number of Jews, Greek and
   women of high standing became converts. His success roused the jealousy
   of the unbelieving Jews, who raised a commotion and caused the apostle
   to escape by night to Berea.

   THE CHURCH AT THESSALONICA was a strong and flourishing one composed of
   Gentiles rather than Jews. Paul longed to visit it again soon after his
   departure, but feared it would involve the converts in danger. He
   therefore sent Timothy from Athens to strengthen the faith of the
   Christians amid their hardships and persecutions, and he brought back a
   favourable report that was a great comfort to Paul.

   OCCASION--The church on the whole was in a good state considering the
   fact that its members had been out of heathenism but a few months.
   Some, however, were in danger of accepting the heathen standard of
   morals. Others were so full of religious excitement and emotion that
   they neglected their daily labours, 1 Thessalonians 4:10-12. While
   others who had lost friends were mourning lest at the second coming of
   Christ these who had fallen asleep would not share in the rapture and
   glory.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To instruct new converts concerning the Christian's duties in this
       life.
    2. To inspire comfort, patience and watchfulness because of the Lord's
       coming.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Spiritual Church.
    2. Holiness.
    3. Coming.
    4. Man of Sin.

  Great Fact I. A Picture of a Spiritual Church.

   1 Thessalonians1.

   Paul thanks God for this church because of the wonderful growth of
   their faith and their increasing love for one another. So marked was
   this that the apostle proudly held them up as an example to all other
   churches. Indeed, their "work of faith, and labour of love and patience
   of hope" had made a profound impression all over northern and southern
   Greece (Macedonia and Achaia.). Everywhere that Paul went it was talk a
   the Christians, what a wonderful work God had done in Thessalonica.

   LESSON--Dr. Scofield points out that when he put verses three and nine
   together we get the past, present and future tense of the Christian
   life. In the past the believer's work of faith was to turn to God from
   idols, John 6:28-29. In the present, the believer's labour of love is
   to serve the true and living God. In the future, the believer's
   patience of hope is to wait for His Son from heaven. This three-fold
   order is seen also in Titus 2:11-13.

  Great Facts II. The Apostle's Example of and Exhortation to Holiness.

   1 Thessalonians 2-4:12.

   Paul reminds the church that in spite of ill-treatment and great
   opposition he preached the gospel to them. Not as a flatterer or seeker
   of wealth, but with the simplicity of a child, and as gentle as a woman
   fondling her own children, 1 Thessalonians 2:1-7. Ye are the witnesses
   of how we used to toil with our hands night and day, and to plead with
   you that you should make call lives worthy of God who is calling you
   into the glory of His kingdom, 1 Thessalonians 2:8-12. We thank God
   also that you bravely en-'lured persecutions from your heathen
   neighbours as did the churches in Judea from the Jews, who killed both
   the Lord Jesus and the prophets, 1 Thessalonians 2:13-15. How glad we
   were to hear from Timothy that you stand firm in faith and in love, and
   that you think kindly of us, and long to see us as we long to see you.
   May the Lord fill you to overflowing with love for one another, and
   make your hearts strong and your lives pure beyond reproach, 1
   Thessalonians 3. It is God's purpose that you abstain from all
   immorality, live quietly, attend to your own business, and work with
   your own hands, 1 Thessalonians 4:1-12.

   LESSON--There are at least three kinds of people:--
    1. Self-pleasers.
    2. Men-pleasers.
    3. God-pleasers.

   The apostle charges us to please God in our religion. our morals, and
   in our daily work. A great statesman said, "We have lived too long for
   our fortunes, and our own interests, it is high time we began to live
   for God." Another said when he was dying, "I count all that part of my
   life lost which I spent not in communion with God, or in doing good!"

  Great Facts III. Comfort of and Watchfulness for Christ's CoMing.

   1 Thessalonians 4:13 to 1 Thessalonians 5:11.

   Those whose loved ones have fallen asleep in death should not give way
   to hopeless sorrow, for at the Coming of the Lord, it is not the living
   who shall greet Him first. But when the arch-angel with a loud shout
   and the trumpet-call of God shall announce the Lord's coming, then the
   dead in Christ shall first rise to meet Him, and those who remain alive
   shall then be caught up in the clouds to share with them the rapture
   and glory, and to be forever with the Lord. Therefore, comfort one
   another with these truths, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. As to the time of
   the Coming, it will be as unexpected as the coming of a thief, but
   while others sleep, let us be watchful and self-controlled. We should
   not live the night lives of sleep and indulgence, but day lives of
   faith, love and hope, encouraging one another and building up one
   another's characters, 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11.

   LESSON--
    1. The second coming was one of the great themes of all the apostles,
       and the bright hope of the early churches. The grandest fact of the
       past is that Jesus Christ the Lord of Glory was made in the
       likeness of men and became obedient unto the death of the cross for
       our salvation. The most important tact of the present is, that this
       same Lord Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the Father
       making intercession for us. The greatest prophesied event of the
       FUTURE is that this same Lord Jesus shall come again, Acts 1:11.
       All who keep before them this hope will purify themselves, 1 John
       3:3, renounce irreligious ways and worldly ambitions, and live
       Godly in this present world. Titus 2:12.
    2. This doctrine should not only supply us with comfort, but inspire
       us to watchfulness, Matthew 24:42. We should do nothing we should
       not like Him to find us doing. We should go nowhere that we would
       be ashamed for Him to find us. If we are always ready, then we are
       bound to be ready when the blessed hour shall come.

  Great Facts IV. The Man of Sin Must First Come.

   2 Thessalonians 2.

   As to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, Paul begs them not to let
   their minds be disturbed by any letter which is supposed to have come
   from him to the effect that the Day of the Lord is come. That Day will
   not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of the
   Anti-Christ, that Incarnation of Wickedness, who will set himself in
   the temple and display himself as God. Wickedness is already at work in
   secret, but the Holy Spirit at present restrains it somewhat, but when
   He is removed out of the way, then Wickedness Incarnate will appear,
   only to be destroyed by the Lord Jesus with the breath of His lips, and
   annihilated by the glory of His coming. For at the Coming of the Lord
   there will be great activity on the part of Satan in the form of
   deceptive miracles, signs and wonders, as well as a wicked attempt to
   delude those who never received and loved the Truth to their own
   Salvation. Sentence will be passed on them because they refused to
   believe the Truth and delighted in wickedness, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12.

   LESSON--
    1. The man of sin is identical with the Anti-Christ referred to by
       Daniel in Daniel 11:31, and by our Lord in Matthew 24:15, and by
       John in Revelation 13:11. He will set himself up in Jerusalem,
       Matthew 24:15.
    2. Will utter blasphemous things against the Most High, and deny the
       Father and the Son, Daniel 11:36.
    3. Will appropriate divine honours, and establish idolatry. 2
       Thessalonians 2:4.
    4. Will take away the restored sacrifice of the Jews. Daniel 19:19.
    5. His wicked activities will continue only three and a half years.
       Revelation 13:5.
    6. He will be cast into the Lake of Fire at Christ's coming,
       Revelation 19:20.

   We see then just as Christ's first coming occasioned an unusual
   outburst of demon activity, so Christ's second coming will be resisted
   by a final desperate effort of Satan, who, imitating Christ, will
   incarnate himself in human form, and will be called the Anti-Christ,
   because he will be a counterfeit Christ.

   It is important that we should understand the many scriptures on this
   subject, and be able to read the signs of the times. For instance, the
   Jews are now about to restore the ancient sacrifice at Jerusalem, that
   the Anti-Christ will prohibit.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATE--About 65 A. D. probably from Phillipi.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--TIMOTHY, was one of Paul's own converts, and was
   called by him "his beloved and faithful son in the Lord," 1 Corinthians
   4:17. He was born at Lystra in Asia Minor, was converted there during
   Paul's first; missionary journey, and although he knew all about Paul's
   persecutions and afflictions, was willing to cast in his lot with him.
   His father was a heathen Greek, but his mother, Eunice, and his
   grandmother, Lois, were Jewesses. He was not circumcised as an infant,
   probably because his father objected. When, however, he became the
   co-worker of Paul in order to conciliate the Jewish Christians, who
   would have weakened Timothy's position as a gospel preacher, Paul took
   Timothy and circumcised him. But Paul refused to have Titus
   circumcised, because he, unlike Timothy, was a Gentile by birth.
   Timothy was ordained as an evangelist, and did much valuable service
   for Paul and was greatly loved by him. His name is mentioned with
   Paul's first imprisonment at Rome for two years, he was the apostle's
   faithful helper, and later, when Paul's life was about to be offered
   up, he affectionately urged Timothy to come to him. It was while
   Timothy was pastor at Ephesus that he received the two letters known as
   1 and 2 Timothy.

   OCCASION--The apostle had hoped to go to Ephesus to counteract false
   teachings, and instruct the church in sound doctrines and church
   government. Being unable to make the journey, and realizing that the
   apostolic period was nearing its end, he, therefore, set down in
   writing for the guidance of all churches, some clear revelations.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To encourage Timothy to war a good warfare.
    2. To instruct the churches in sound doctrines and church government.
    3. To inspire Christian behaviour in the house of God.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Doctrines.
    2. Worship.
    3. Church Officers.
    4. Conduct
    5. Classes.

  Great Fact I. Unsound Doctrines Rebuked.

   1 Timothy 1.

   Paul here charges those who teach new and strange doctrines, not to mix
   fables and legends with the gospel. The Law is excellent in that it
   proves to men that they cannot be righteous of themselves, and
   therefore directs them to Christ, 1 Timothy 1:4-8. Paul is grateful
   that the Lord in His loving kindness has appointed him to be a
   minister, although once he blasphemed, Persecuted and insulted, 1
   Timothy 1:13. The exhaustless patience of Christ was shown towards him
   that he might be an example to all who afterwards believe of how Christ
   can save and use a great sinner, 1 Timothy 1:12-15. He urges Timothy to
   wage a noble war, with faith and a clear conscience, for some having
   thrust aside have wrecked their lives, 1 Timothy 1:18-20.

   LESSON--When men come to die, the religion they have thought out and
   invented for themselves will yield them no comfort, but will be like
   the religion of a certain sculptor. On his death-bed a priest pointing
   to a beautiful cross the sculptor had made, said, "Behold your God, who
   died for you." "Alas!" said the sculptor, "I made it." There was no
   comfort for him in the work of his own hands. In religion, that which
   is created in one's own brain will yield no comfort to one's own heart.
   The most important question of all is, "What does God say?"

  Great Fact II Public Worship.

   1 Timothy 2.

   Paul first exhorts the members of the church to pray regularly for
   those in authority over them and for all men, that Christians may be
   able to lead quiet, profitable and religious lives. This is acceptable
   in the sight of Christ our Saviour who is the one mediator between God
   and men, and who gave Himself as the ransom price for all, 1 Timothy
   2:1-6.

   The apostle desired that the men should lead the prayers and that they
   should not pray angrily against their fellow-Christians, 1 Timothy 2:8.
   Women should dress quietly and modestly and not with jewellery and
   costly clothing, and the apostle would not consent to a woman teaching
   men in public, for Adam was made before Eve, and women find the place
   of highest well-being in family life, 1 Timothy 2:9-15.

   LESSON--When a heathen woman who offered herself for baptism was asked
   if she would give up her ornaments for Christ, it was an unexpected
   blow, but after looking at her necklace again and again, she said, "I
   love Christ more than this." Can we say this about unworthy pleasures
   and unscriptural beliefs?

  Great Facts III The Qualifications of Church Officers.

   1 Timothy 3.

   A pastor should be a man of blameless character, having only one living
   wife, not quarrelsome, nor greedy for money, but a skilful teacher, and
   one who makes his own children behave well. Not a new convert lest he
   be intoxicated with pride, and above all he should have a good
   reputation among the people outside the church, 1 Timothy 3:1-7.
   Deacons and deaconesses must have the same moral qualifications, be
   tested first and only appointed to their office if no objection is
   raised against them. They too, must rule their households well, and
   they who serve nobly gain an honourable position and much freedom of
   speech in the faith, 1 Timothy 3:8-13.

   LESSON--Paul is here emphazing the need for Christian behaviour. Some
   people think that behaviour is not a very important thing, and yet
   behaviour reveals character. It is not "do-haviour" but "behaviour."
   What we DO may be accidental, what we ARE is everything. It is an
   every-hour sermon. The victory of the early church was won by its
   behaviour. "See how these Christians love one another," it was said.
   "How unblameably we behave ourselves," said Paul to the Thessalonians.

   "I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way," said the psalmist.

  Great Facts IV. Conduct of Good Servants of Christ Jesus.

   1 Timothy 4.

   Warn the brethren that in later times some will turn away from the
   faith, giving themselves up to spiritualism, and making use of the
   hypocrisies of lying teachers. These teach that holiness is obtained
   through abstinence from marriage and from certain kinds of food. It is
   not, however, for man to place restrictions upon what God has given
   with liberal hand for our use. Only receive it gratefully as God's
   gift. 1 Timothy 4:1-5.

   Lead a Godly life, for while bodily exercise is profitable for some
   things, yet Godliness is profitable for both this life and the life to
   come. Let your conversation and conduct, your love, faith and purity be
   an example to those who hold the faith. Apply yourself to reading,
   preaching and teaching and do not neglect the divine gift that many at
   your ordination prophesied was in you. By doing these things he would
   save himself from the dominion of sin and unto more blessed likeness to
   Christ, and save his hearers from the guilt and penalty of sin, 1
   Timothy 4:6-16.

   LESSON--A man had a camel that was wasting away. "See," cried he to a
   simple son of the desert, "I have tried cordials and elixir, balsams
   and lotions, yet all in vain." The son of the desert looked at the
   hollow sides and staring bones and said, "Your camel needeth but one
   thing, food, good food and plenty of it." "Dear me," said the
   traveller, "I never thought of that." So when we are in low spirits
   there is our cure. We don't need pity, we don't deserve it. We must
   give our starved souls more prayer, more meditation on the Word and
   more communion with God. This is a sure cure for all our spiritual
   ills.

  Great Facts V. The Bight Attitude Towards Various Classes.

   1 Timothy 5; 1 Timothy 6.

   Deal wisely and fairly with the different classes in the church. Only
   those widows sixty years old should be placed on the Venation. Young
   widows should marry, be loyal wives and rear Christian children.
   Officers of the church should be honoured and supported. Be slow in
   receiving accusations, but rebuke offenders publicly so that others may
   take warning. 1 Timothy 5. Christian servants should not think any less
   of their masters because they are their fellow-Christian, but should
   rather serve them better, 1 Timothy 6:12. Beware of discussions and
   wranglings with those who do it for gain, for it is Godliness with
   contentment that gives great gain, 1 Timothy 6:5-6. Urge upon rich
   Christians that the love of money leads to all kinds of evils. They
   should rather be rich in good deeds, open-handed and generous, storing
   up for themselves a good foundation in the future life. Paul charges us
   before the life-giving God, and Jesus Christ who, before Pilate, (John
   18:37) made the great profession of faith, to keep ourselves pure and
   unblameable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy
   6:7-21.

   LESSON--When the gladiator would enter the Coliseum at Rome, he would
   look up to the 87,000 people who were assembled to see if he acquitted
   himself well, and then his eye would rest upon the emperor and his
   court. The thought of the watching eyes, of the applause he might win,
   and of the reward of victory all nerved him to do his best. So, Oh
   Christian, one infinitely greater than Caesar, is looking down upon
   your arena. He it is who now commands thee, "Take the cross and win the
   crown!" He it is who charges thee, "Fight the good fight of faith, lay
   hold of eternal life."

   2 Timothy 2:1-7.
     * KEY WORD--"ENDURE."
     * KEY VERSE--2 Timothy 2:3.
     * KEY PHRASE,--"BE A WORKMAN THAT NEEDETH NOT TO BE ASHAMED."

   Home Readings.

   In this book we have the last known words of the Apostle Paul, and his
   last instructions to his favourite disciple and through him to the
   churches. His course is almost run. He has fought a good fight. Before
   he shall end his wonderful life in noble martyrdom, he writes this
   letter. It is worthy, therefore, of prayerful reading. For family altar
   read:--
     * Sunday--Stir up thy gift,--2 Timothy 1:1-9.
     * Monday--Hold fast to sound teaching,--2 Timothy 1:10-18.
     * Tuesday--Endure hardness as a good soldier,--2 Timothy 2:1-15.

     * Friday--All scripture is profitable,--2 Timothy 3:1-17.
     * Saturday--Last charge of the apostle,--2 Timothy 4:1-8.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATE--68 A. D.

   PLACE--During his last imprisonment at Rome.

   OCCASION--Paul was now a prisoner in Rome for the second time, awaiting
   a hearing before the emperor. He was not being treated with the
   consideration shown him before, and because of the danger and shame,
   all his friends but Luke had deserted him. Knowing the wicked emperor,
   Nero, Paul felt sure his own death would not be long delayed, and
   longing for the presence of his beloved son in the faith, Timothy, he
   sends this letter, bidding him come with all speed to Rome. Then
   fearing that Timothy might arrive too late to receive his last
   instructions face to face, the condemned apostle pours forth his soul
   with all the earnestness of a dying man.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To inspire Timothy to Christian heroism.
    2. To instruct him in his pastoral duties.
    3. To charge him to combat false teachings.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Boldness.
    2. Endurance.
    3. Resource.
    4. Last Charge.

  Great Facts I. A Call to Boldness.

   2 Timothy 1.

   Paul thanks God without ceasing for Timothy's sincere faith, and for
   his religious training received at the hands of his grandmother, Lois,
   and his mother, Eunice. He begs him to keep in active exercise the
   spiritual gifts received at his ordination, for the Spirit Which God
   gave was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love and
   self-control. Therefore, Timothy should not be ashamed of his Lord, nor
   of Paul the Lord's prisoner, but should rather join him in suffering
   for the gospel's sake. God's purposes and grace were made known to us
   by the appearing of our Saviour, who has put an end to death, and
   brought life and immorality from darkness into light by the gospel. "I
   have perfect assurance that Christ will keep me until the Day of His
   Coming. Hold fast to the sound teaching that you have heard from me."

   LESSONS--
    1. Timothy had gifts and graces imparted to him through ordination at
       Paul's hands. None, however, but the apostles had the power of
       imparting these gifts. Our gifts come in regeneration and
       sanctification and should be stirred up by reading, meditation and
       prayer.
    2. Cowardice is unworthy in us, who have received as a sacred trust
       the gospel truth to spread everywhere. The fear of man is very
       common, but those who fear God ought to know no other fear.
       Proverbs 14:26.

  Great Facts II. A Call to Endurance.

   2 Timothy 2.

   The truths you have learned from me en trust to reliable men, who in
   their will be able to teach others. Endure hardships as a brave soldier
   of Christ, not entangling yourself in ordinary affairs, but seeking to
   please your superior officer. No athlete wins the wreath of victory
   unless he does this. As the farmer is the first to partake of the
   fruits of his labour so shall it be with you. Keep in mind that Christ
   is risen from the dead, as told in the gospel entrusted to me, in the
   service of which I am suffering hardships even to being put in fetters
   as a criminal. But I gladly submit to anything, just so the gospel is
   not fettered! Urge the people to shun foolish and ignorant discussions,
   for they only breed quarrels, and a servant of the Lord should never
   quarrel, 2 Timothy 2:24. As one of God's workmen, do your utmost to win
   God's approval, by handling aright the word of truth, Vs. 16. Banish
   all evil desires, but rather follow after righteousness, faith, love
   and peace, in company with those who out of pure heart call on the
   Lord, 2 Timothy 2:22.

   LESSONS--
    1. We must watch lest the comforts and innocent enjoyments of lit make
       us to love ease too well, and make Us less sturdy and brave than a
       good soldier ought to be. Endurance is not merely bearing
       difficulties and disappointments, but bearing them manfully and
       with the spirit of a hero. Samuel Rutherford, when imprison for the
       gospel's sake, used to date his letters from "Christ's Palace," and
       when Madame Guyon was shut up in a castle, she said, "Now the Lord
       has allowed me to be placed in a cage; I have nothing to do but
       sing."
    2. If we would be God's workmen who win His approval, we must like the
       apostle, "Be always abounding in the work of the Lord." Only so can
       Christians definitely accomplish something worthy, have a good
       conscience, and live under God's smile. Faithful service is the
       highway to the hills of happiness, and the world needs as never
       before buoyant, radiant workers. Shall we not then "give every
       flying minute something to keep in store."

  Great Facts III. The Resource of the Believer in Perilous Times.

   2 Timothy 3.

   Be sure of this that in the last days perilous times will come when men
   will be laden with sins, and while they retain the outward form of
   religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back upon
   such men as these, for their minds are corrupted, and as regards the
   Faith they are utterly worthless, 2 Timothy 3:8. All who seek to live a
   religious life in union with Christ Jesus must suffer persecution, but
   wicked people and imposters will go from bad to worse deceiving others
   as they themselves have been deceived, 2 Timothy 3:12-13. Have unshaken
   faith in the Holy Scriptures, for they lead unto salvation, and being
   inspired by God are profitable for teaching, for refuting error, for
   giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness, so that the
   man of God might be noble and equipped for every work, 2 Timothy
   3:14-17.

   LESSONS--
    1. As people progress in error there will be widespread moral decay.
       Wickedness will make the times perilous. It will be a time of
       danger to the faith of God's people, and a time of peril to their
       lives.
    2. The believer's resource, however, is to be found in the Holy
       Scriptures. In the bright light of its truth, errors and heresies
       will be exposed, the deluded shall be set straight, the wavarers
       established, the weak strengthened, and the believer shall find
       ever-new supplies of comfort and hope, and gain new insight into
       the depths of revelation. Let us then delight ourselves in the
       triumphant certainities of Scripture, for happy is that man who
       knows the ways of God.

  Great Facts IV. The Last Charge of the Great Apostle.

   2 Timothy 4.

   I solemnly charge you before God and Jesus Christ, who will judge you
   and who will soon appear, spread the gospel everywhere whether it is
   convenient or inconvenient to do so. Convince, rebuke, exhort, for a
   time will come when people will not endure sound teaching, but will
   rely upon fictions. But be thou temperate, face hardships, do the work
   of a missionary, and discharge all the duties of your office. As for
   me, my lifes' blood is already being poured out, and the time of my
   departure is come. I have run the great race, I have finished the
   Course, I have kept the Faith. Now the crown of righteousness awaits
   me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me in the crowning
   day, and not to me only, but to all who have loved His appearing, 2
   Timothy 4:1-8.

   LESSONS--
    1. These tender farewell words from the greatest man God ever made
       have a solemn message for every Christian as well as for Timothy.
       We should seriously consider that the gospel-truth as a priceless
       pearl is entrusted to us for the salvation of others and that soon
       we must give an account of the trust reposed in us. Happy shall we
       be if we have been good trustees.
    2. Life's evening hour for Paul was full of glory. He forgot that the
       lions, the flames or a cruel cross would end his earthly life; the
       good fight was ended, the long, hard race was run, and the memories
       of a noble life gave him great peace at eventide. Thus we learn
       that God's good men:--
         1. Welcome death or the Lord's Coming.
         2. That they look forward with certainty to the crown of
            righteousness.
         3. They are anxious for the good work to go on after their death
            with uninterrupted power and success. Let us walk by faith
            that we too may have a coronation in the everlasting summer of
            the saints.

   Titus 2:11-15.
     * KEY WORD--"GOOD WORKS."
     * KEY VERSE--Titus 2:7.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE VIRTUES AND GRACES OF CHURCH OFFICERS AND CHURCH
       MEMBERS."

   vices to be shunned.

   For family altar read:
     * Sunday--A church officer should be a man of blameless
       character,--Titus 1:1-9.

     * Friday--Messages to Timothy and Titus have same emphasis,--1
       Timothy 6:1-12.
     * Saturday--Be devoted to good works,--Titus 3:9-15.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATE--About 65 A. D. the same as I Timothy.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--Titus was a Gentile and Paul's child in the faith,
   Titus 1:4. Also one of his co-workers, 2 Corinthians 8:23. When the
   church council was held at Jerusalem, Acts 15:13-19, to decide whether
   the Gentile Christians must be circumcised or not, Titus was made the
   test case and Paul's plea for freedom from Jewish ordinances was
   granted. As Paul's trusted friend, he went to Corinth with both the
   first and second epistles and tactfully and successfully persuaded the
   church to do the right thing in discipline and in the matter of
   divisions. Paul made a missionary journey to the island of Crete, and
   left Titus there in charge of the work. It was during Titus' stay at
   Crete that the apostle wrote this letter.

   OCCASION--Apollos was about to journey to Crete, and Paul, hearing that
   certain converts from Judaism were deceiving whole families with false
   teachings, he took the opportunity of sending a letter to Titus full of
   practical advice. He suggests that the way to counteract the harmful
   influences is to lay more emphasis upon sound doctrines and holy
   character.

   PURPOSE--To set forth the virtues and graces that should exist in
   church officers and church members, and that these virtues and graces
   should be expressed in good works.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Church-Officers.
    2. Church-Members.
    3. Good Works.

  Great Facts I. The Kind of Officers a Church Should Have.

   Titus 1.

   Officers of the church should be men of irreproachable character,
   having one living wife, and whose children are not accused of being
   unruly. Not self-willed or quick-tempered, not addicted to drink or to
   fighting, or to questionable money-making. On the contrary, he should
   be hospitable, a lover of the right, discreet, just, a man of holy life
   and capable of self-restraint. One who holds doctrines that are
   according to the scripture that he may be able to encourage others by
   sound teaching, and to refute opponents. There are false teachers who
   for money will pervert the message of the gospel, and the Cretains
   themselves, as one of their teachers have said, "Are always liars, base
   brutes and lazy gluttons." Rebuke such, sharply, that they may be sound
   in the Faith and pay no attention to those who would turn their backs
   upon the Truth. Everything is pure to the pm e-minded, but to those
   whose minds are polluted, and who are unbelievers, nothing is pure.
   They profess to know God, but disown Him by their actions, being
   degraded and disobedient, and are worthless as far as every good work
   is concerned.

   LESSONS--
    1. A minister must have but one living wife, but he is not compelled
       to be married as are the priests of the Greek church, neither
       should he be compel led to remain unmarried, as are the priest of
       the Roman Catholic church. This pas sage simply condemns polygamy.
    2. A minister will be judged by his family life, he who cannot rule
       his own children wet cannot rule the church of God, 1 Timothy 3:5.
    3. He must have all the moral and social qualities Of a good man, and
       should be known for his virtues and sympathies.
    4. He must be doctrinally sound, not always running after new and
       novel theories, not a creator of the truth, but a teacher of it,
       remembering that the Truth has been sacredly entrusted to him.
    5. These qualifications which are applied to ministers here are
       applied to other church office in 1 Timothy 3:8-10.

  Great Facts II. Becoming Conduct for Church Members.

   Titus 2.

   Older men should be temperate, serious and discreet, strong in faith,
   love and endurance. So too, the older women should be reverent in their
   manner, divoiding scandal and not given to drink, that they may teach
   what is right and tram the younger women to love their husbands and
   children and to be housewifely. Young men should exercise self-control,
   and be models of a noble life in everything. Servants should be
   obedient to their masters, trying to give satisfaction in everything,
   not contradicting or stealing, but showing praiseworthy fidelity so as
   to recommend the teaching of God our Saviour in everything. For the
   loving-kindness of God leads us to renounce irreligious ways and live
   upright in this present world while we await the Appearing of our great
   God and Saviour. For He gave Himself for us that He might deliver us
   from all wickedness, and to purify for Himself a select people zealous
   in good works.

   LESSONS--
    1. Paul not only soars high into the unspeakable mysteries of God and
       into the heighths and depths of God's eternal purposes, but also
       goes into every detail of practical Godliness. He lifts up the
       humblest duties to a heavenly platform, he would bring every
       relationship into accordance with the laws of righteousness, and
       seeks to make all human life pure and happy.
    2. John Selden was so thoroughly convinced of the superior value of
       the Holy Scriptures, as to declare that Titus, Titus 2:11-14,
       afforded him more solid Satisfaction than all he had ever read.

  Great Facts III. Church-Members Should Be Devoted to Good Works.

   Titus 3.

   Be submissive to rulers and authorities and be ready for every good
   work. Speak ill of no one, avoid quarrelling and show a gentle spirit
   in dealing with others. Remember the time when we ourselves had all the
   faults that we hate in others. But through the kindness of God our
   Saviour we were saved, not as a result of the good works we had done,
   but in fulfilment of His merciful purposes. He saves us by that Washing
   which was a New Birth to us, and by the renewing power of the Holy
   Spirit, which power He poured out on us richly through Christ Jesus our
   Saviour. Have nothing to do with foolish discussions and controversies,
   for these are useless and futile. If a man is causing divisions among
   you, after warning him once or twice, have nothing more to say to him.
   You may be sure that such a man has forsaken the Truth and is in the
   wrong, he stands self-condemned. Let all our people devote themselves
   to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs, and that their
   lives may not be unfruitful.

   LESSONS--
    1. The washing and the renewing in Titus 3:5 are both done by the Holy
       Spirit. Regeneration always consists of two elements, first
       cleansing, second, renewing, or the giving of new life, John 3: 5,
       and Titus 3:5, both mean this. "Except a man be cleansed by the
       Spirit's application of the blood of Christ, and except the Spirit
       give him new life, he cannot see the kingdom of God." See also
       Hebrews 9:13-14, where we are told that it is the blood of Christ
       that purges our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
       Also Revelation 7:14 where the white-robed ones are said to have
       been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.
    2. The doctrines of grace are the true fountains from which all good
       works flow. We should, therefore, devote ourselves to good works,

    1. They are a blessing to man, James 1:25.
    2. God remembers them, Hebrews 6:9-10.
    3. They will be an evidence of faith in the judgement, Matthew
       25:34-40

LESSON THEME:--PHILEMON

   Philemon 1:10-16.
     * KEY WORD--"BROTHER."
     * KEY VERSE--Philemon 1:16.
     * KEY PHRASE--"UNPROFITABLE SINNERS MADE PROFITABLE."

   Home Readings.

   This epistle has been called the most beautiful and most intensely
   human of all Paul's letters.

   For family altar read:--
     * Sunday--The character of Philemon,--Philemon 1:1-7.
     * Monday--Paul pleads for the runaway,--Philemon 1:8-16.

     * Friday--Much forgiveness begets much love,--Luke 7:41-50.
     * Saturday--Be tender-hearted toward one another,--Ephesians 4:20-32.

   WRITER--Paul.

   DATE and PLACE of writing, same as Colossians, 62 A. D., during his
   first imprisonment at Rome.

   TO WHOM written--Philemon. Philemon was a member of the church at
   Colesse, and was probably converted at Ephesus, during Paul's
   three-year stay there. He was a man of wealth and celebrated for his
   hospitality for the church met at his house. It was customary in those
   days for people of means to own a number of slaves, and to keep less
   than ten was hardly possible for a man who wished to move in high
   society. APPHIA was the Christian wife of Philemon, and ARCHIPPUS, his
   son, and a fellow labourer with Paul in the gospel.

   ABOUT WHOM WRITTEN--Onesimus. He was a slave of Philemon, and still a
   heathen when he robbed his master and ran off to Rome. There he came
   into touch with Paul, who was a prisoner in his own hired house. It is
   probable that at his master's house, where the Christians met to
   worship he had often heard him speak of Paul to whom Philemon owed his
   conversion. This meeting of the runaway slave with the great apostle
   led to his conversion, Philemon 1:10, and he at once began to assist
   Paul in the work. The apostle would have gladly kept Onesimus with him,
   but as he could not do this without the knowledge and consent of
   Philemon, he sent Onesimus bath to his master. Paul also recommends
   Onesimus to the Church at Colosse as a "Faithful and beloved brother
   who is one of you." This recommendation would be of great value at
   Colonic assuring the Christians there that

   Onesimus was not now merely a heathen slave, but is Paul's spiritual
   child.

   PURPOSE--To show that the gospel has the power to win a thief and a
   runaway, and to soften the harsh relationship that of o13 existed
   between a master and his slaves.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Greeting.
    2. Faith and Kindness.
    3. Plea.

  Great Facts I. The Apostle's Greeting.

   Philemon 1:1-3.

   Paul begins this letter, as was his custom, with words of appreciation,
   calling his friends, "our dearly beloved, our fellow-labourer, our
   fellow-soldier." He did this not from a desire to please or to say nice
   sounding things, but because he always recognized good in others, and
   had a heart full of love for them. The best way to secure the doing of
   further good is to give deserved praise for good already done.

   Philemon, by throwing open his house for prayer and worship, sets us an
   example for today. When a church-house is not nearby, it is a very
   worthy thing for a man to make his house "a house of prayer."
   House-to-house prayer meetings have done a vast amount of good, and the
   custom should not be allowed to pass away.

  Great Facts II. Philemon's Faith and Kindness.

   Philemon 1:4-7.

   Paul here thanks God for the faith which Philemon had toward the Lord
   Jesus, and for the love and kindness which he showed toward all the
   Lord's people, and the apostle prays that Philemon's faith may ever
   result in everything that is good and Christ-like.

   LESSON--Faith in Christ is a saving grace, the very principle of the
   Christian life, and Of good works. This faith is manifested in love to
   fellow-Christians for these graces never exist separately, for those
   who love Christ must and will love those also who are begotten of Him,
   1 John 5:1.

  Great Facts III Paul's Plea for the Runaway.

   Philemon 1:8-21.

   The apostle here claims to have authority to command Philemon in this
   matter, and yet for love's sake, he, the grey-haired Paul now a
   prisoner for Christ's sake, pleads for his new spiritual child
   Onesimus, the runaway slave, whom he is sending back, who once was of
   little service, not only to Philemon but to the apostle as well. He had
   become so dear to Paul that it was like tearing out his very heart to
   send him back, yet be would not keep him without Philemon's consent.
   This temporary separation of the slave from his master was intended by
   God, that his master might have him back, forever, no longer as a
   slave, but as something better--a dearly beloved brother.

   The apostle further pleads with Philemon to receive Onesimus back as he
   would receive him--Paul--and if the fugitive has caused any loss or
   owes anything, then charge it to Paul for he will repay it, although
   Paul will say nothing about Philemon owing his very self to him. Paul
   would gain something from Philemon because of his union with the Lord,
   and has confidence that he will do even more than is asked.

   LESSON--
    1. It must not be thought that because Paul returned a slave to his
       master that therefore, Christianity endorses slavery. The truth is,
       that the law as it then stood gave certain rights to Philemon, and
       an apostle would be the last of all men to violate the law. His
       mission was to set forth such truths as the fatherhood of God for
       believers, the sonship of Christ, and the brotherhood of man, so
       that masters would recognize their responsibility to God, and see
       that their Christian slaves were fellow-citizens of the household
       of God. As Christian nations have come to believe these Bible
       truths, slavery has been abolished. Notice that when Paul sent
       Onesimus back to Philemon, it was not as a slave to be punished for
       deserting, but as a dearly beloved Christian brother.
    2. As Paul found Onesimus wandering from his master's house and his
       place of duty, so the Lord Jesus found us wandering from God, Luke
       19:10. The story is told of a mother, who although she had eleven
       children buried in the little graveyard, wept not for the dead, but
       for a living son who had run away from home. As she sent a friend
       to find him, she said. "If you find my boy, sick, or in prison, or
       in want, do all you can for him and I will repay you." She had the
       streets and alleys of a great city searched until she found him. If
       parents, "being evil," are so moved to find their prodigals, how
       much more the Saviour who is all love?
    3. As Paul pleaded that all of the slave's demerits be placed to his
       account, and all of Paul's merits be placed to the slave's account,
       so Christ has taken upon Himself all our sin and guilt, and in
       exchange has bestowed upon us His righteousness and His divine
       nature, 2 Peter 1:4. How happy we should be that Christ will pay
       all our debts, and so identify Himself with us that we all shall be
       received as Himself!
    4. As Philemon received Onesimus, so God will receive us and make us
       profitable. Grace changed a criminal, in this case, to a Christian
       brother, from unprofitable to profitable. How many of the world's
       greatest characters were nobodies, lost amid a lost multitude,
       until Christ called them by name, put a new heart and a new spirit
       within them, and made them somebodies in the realm of noble
       service. Who would ever have heard of Peter, James and John if
       Christ had not made them profitable to the world? Augustine, Luther
       and Muller would have been Dust ordinary failures, common
       worldlings, but for the enriching grace of the Lord Jesus, which
       made some of the most valuable men who has ever lived. If our lives
       are not counting for as much as they should, let us give ourselves
       utterly to Him who magnifies and makes valuable every life laid
       upon the altar.

         Lesson No. 58--Read Scriptures in Class Out of Your Own Bible.

LESSON THEME:--HEBREW

   Hebrews 1:1-8.
     * KEY WORD--"SUPERIOR."
     * KEY VERSE--Hebrews 1:1-2.
     * KEY PHRASE--"THE GOSPEL IS SUPERIOR TO THE LAW."

   Home Readings.

   Prof. Bruce calls "The Epistle of the Hebrews the first defence of
   Christianity." Read the book through and for family altar read:--
     * Sunday--Christ is superior to prophets and angels,--Hebrews 1.
     * Monday--Christ is superior to Moses,--Hebrews 3.
     * Tuesday--Christ is superior to Aaron.--Hebrews 5:1-10.
     * Wednesday--The New Covenant is superior,--Hebrews 8:6-13.
     * Thursday--A superior worship,--Hebrews 10:19-31.
     * Friday--The faith-way is superior,--Hebrews 11:1-14.
     * Saturday--Christ is the Author and Finisher of faith,--Hebrews
       12:1-15.

   WRITER--Most probably Paul, although scholars are divided on the
   question of authorship, and think that Apollos wrote it.

   DATE--About 65 A. D., before the destruction of the temple.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--To the converts from Judaism, probably in the church
   at Alexandria in Egypt, which was founded by Mark.

   OCCASION--These Jewish Christians were subject to severe persecutions
   and to constant arguments and contempt from the non-Christian Jews.
   This so weakened their resistance and faith that they were in danger of
   abandoning their allegiance to Jesus Christ, and of going back into
   Judaism.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To prove that the Old Covenants and Ceremonial Laws of Moses came
       to an end in Christ.
    2. To warn against the leaving of the substance of the gospel and the
       going back to the shadow of the Law.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Prophets and Angels.
    2. Moses.
    3. O. T. Priesthood.
    4. New Covenant.
    5. Faith.
    6. Privileges.

  Great Fact I. Christ Is Superior to Prophets and Angels.

   Hebrews 1; Hebrews 2.

   God, who in former generations spoke to our forefathers through His
   prophets, has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son. the Heir of
   all things, through whom He made the universe. For He is the radiance
   of His glory, and the very expression of His Being, the Upholder of the
   universe, and the Deliverer of men from sin. Christ is as much superior
   to angels as His name, Son, is superior to theirs, servants. Therefore,
   it is dangerous to reject the great salvation, offered, not by angels,
   but by the Lord Himself, whose testimony was confirmed by God with
   signs and miracles and the imparting of the Holy Spirit. God has not
   given to angels the control of the future world, but will place all
   things under man. Jesus tasted the bitterness of death for mankind, in
   order that He might render the Devil powerless. who has the power of
   death, and to deliver men from fear of death. Jesus came not to the
   help of angels, but to the help of men, in order that He might prove a
   sympathetic and faithful High Priest in all man's relations with God.

   LESSON--
    1. We see something of the dignity of the Christian, for God cares for
       him, and angel's minister unto him.
    2. We see the dignity of service, for angels, the highest order of
       created beings, are but ministering servants and minister unto the
       heirs of salvation.
    3. We see the supreme dignity of the Son of God for He is the Lord of
       angels, is surrounded by a thousand thousands of them, who veil
       their faces before His glory while they praise Him.

  Great Fact II. Christ Is Superior to Moses.

   Hebrews 3; Hebrews 4.

   As Moses was faithful in all his affairs, consider how faithful to the
   God who appointed Him was Jesus, the High Priest of our religion. He
   was worthy of far higher honour than Moses, just as the master of the
   house has more honour than its steward. Moses was faithful as a
   witness, but the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son.

   Take warning from the unbelief of Israel which prevented them from
   entering the Land of Rest promised them by God. They did not enter into
   the real spiritual rest that God had promised because of unworthiness.
   True rest comes when we are perfectly in tune with God, as all nature
   was when God finished the work of creation, and rested on the seventh
   day. Let us make every effort to come into harmony and true rest with
   God, for nothing can be hid from His sight. Because Christ is our High
   Priest let us draw near boldly to the Throne of Love, to find pity and
   love for the hour of need.

   LESSONS--
    1. Moses was only a part of the household of faith, Christ was the
       Founder of it.
    2. Moses was but a servant in God's house, Christ was the Lord of it.
    3. Moses' life and work was but a type of things to come, Christ was
       the Reality. So everything on earth that we value is only a symbol
       of something better in Christ. Happy are we if before the symbol
       fades we have grasped the reality, if when Moses passes out of
       sight. Jesus is left!

  Great Fact III. Christ Is Superior to the Old Testament Priesthood.

   Hebrews 5; Hebrews 6; Hebrews 7; Hebrews 8:6.

   Christ not only has the qualifications which Aaron, the earthly high
   priest, had but in addition He is a priest forever after the order of
   the eternal Melchizedec priesthood. We should leave behind us the
   elementary teachings about Christ and press on to maturity, not going
   batik to the first stages of the Christian life, to start it all over
   again. For if it were possible for those tasting of the heavenly gift
   and partaking of the Holy Spirit, to fall away, It would be impossible
   to bring them to repentance again, for they have recrucified the Son of
   God and exposed Him to open contempt.

   The order of Melchizedec, after which Christ was made a priest, is
   superior to that of Aaron because this priesthood is continuous and
   will never end. Abraham, and the priests in the Aaronic line, paid
   tithes to Melchizedec showing him to be the greater, also he, the
   superior, gave his blessing to the Aaronic line, the inferior. Further,
   the Aaronic priests could not make men perfect, because they themselves
   were mortal and sinful, but Christ is eternal and sinless, wherefore He
   is able to save and sanctify to the uttermost all who come to God
   through Him.

   LESSONS--

   1. Christ's priesthood. like that of Melchizedec, was:--
    1. A royal priesthood, they were both Kings of peace and
       righteousness.
    2. Was for all mankind, and not for the Jews only.
    3. Had no human ancestry.
    4. Remains forever without a successor. When Melchizedec (passed away
       no one stepped in his place, so the priesthood of Christ continues
       forever.
    5. It awakens gratitude which will be shown in the payment of tithes
       for promoting the gospel.

  Great Fact IV. The New Covenant Is Superior to the Old.

   Hebrews 8:7 to Hebrews 10:39.

   First, because of its superior spiritual promises to write God's law
   upon men's hearts and minds, and to be merciful to their wrong doings.

   Second, because Christ officiates in heaven, a superior sanctuary.

   Third, because in the old temple the priest entered the Holy of Holies
   only once a year, but Christ has entered it once to all.

   Fourth, Christ has not Offered the live, of calves and goats which gave
   ceremonial purification only, but He sacrificed Himself as a lamb
   without blemish, to cleanse our conscience from dead rituals, to serve
   the living God.

   Therefore we should boldly approach God through Christ, the new and
   living way. Let us have hearts full of faith, and never have our hope
   shaken. Let us incite ourselves to love and noble actions, and not
   neglect the assembling of ourselves together for worship, especially as
   the Lord's coming is drawing near.

  Great Fact V. The Superiority of Faith.

   Hebrews 11.

   Remember the heroes Of faith who subdued kingdoms, ruled righteously,
   gained the fulfilment of God's promises, shut the mouth of lions,
   quelled the (fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the sword, found
   strength in the hour of weakness, were mighty in war and routed hostile
   armies--all this through faith which is the title deed to things hoped
   tor, and gives us a foretaste of things not seen. These heroes endured
   every kind of torture, because in their sublime conquering faith they
   saw the reward that awaited them. As yet they have not entered into all
   that God promised them, but in fellowship with us will enter into the
   complete realization of all spiritual blessings.

   LESSON--It is impossible to be a hero in anything unless one Is first a
   hero in faith. Faith will make us to live like kings, and our only
   crown is worn in the heart, and our deeds are written down only by
   angels. The exalted lives of these brave men of old should inspire us
   to be strong, and to quit ourselves like men, yea, to live and die full
   of faith.

  Great Fact VI. The Superiority of the Christian's Privileges and Duties.

   Hebrews 12; Hebrews 13.

   Because of the great company of onlookers from heaven, we should be
   willing to give up every sinful habit, to run life's race with
   patience, to endure chastening, follow peace and purity of heart, ever
   looking to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith.

   We have not come to Mt. Sinai, from which came the Law, and which
   showed the abiding places of God's nature, but to Mt. Zion (which
   stands for the churches, the abiding places of God's spiritual
   presence) which show forth the Greatness of God's love.

   However, we must be very careful not to turn away from Him who teaches
   from Heaven and we should practice Christian virtues, and be loyal to
   Christ and the leaders in the church, Hebrews 13:7.

   LESSON--What a wonderful contrast there Is between the Old and New
   Coven ants.
    1. Sinai, an earthly mountain surrounded by gloom and storm, vs. Zion
       representing the churches, full of Heavenly light and comfort.
    2. Israel gathered around the mountain, were forbidden to touch it and
       were afraid, Vs. Christians gladly receiving the word, baptized,
       added to church, glad fellowship, praising God, shrouded in
       darkness, revealed in fire. Vs. Christians drawing near to God with
       true hearts and full assurance of faith.
    3. The priests offering the sacrifices of slain beasts, vs. the
       Christian offering his body as a living sacrifice, offering the
       fruit of his lips, praise and offering his substance.
    4. The blood sprinkled on the people to ratify the old covenant, did
       not cleanse the conscience. Vs. The ever-cleansing blood of Christ
       that makes complete atonement for sin.

     __________________________________________________________________

            Lesson No. 59--Make this Course Your Daily Bible Guide.

LESSON THEME:--JAMES

   James 2:14-20.
     * KEY WORD--"WORKS."
     * KEY VERSE--James 2:20.
     * KEY PHRASE--"SHOW YOUR FAITH BY YOUR WORKS."

   Home Readings.

   The epistle of James is the first of the seven General Epistles, so
   called because they are not addressed to any particular person or
   church, but to Christians in general.

   For family altar read:--
     * Sunday--Faith will be tested by trials,--James 1:1-12.
     * Monday--God does not tempt men,--James 1:13-21.
     * Tuesday--Have respect for rich and poor alike,--James 2:1-13.
     * Wednesday--Faith without works is a dead faith,--James 3:1-14.
     * Thursday--True faith will control the tongue,--James 3:1-14.
     * Friday--A rebuke of worldliness,--James 4:1-10.
     * Saturday--The prayer of faith shall save the sick,--James 5:7-20.

   WRITER--James, "the Lord's brother." Our Lord's other half-brothers
   were Joseph, Simon and Jude (the latter wrote the epistle bearing his
   name). They were all unbelievers until after Christ's resurrection,
   John 7:5. But the fact that they with the other disciples, continued
   steadfastly In prayer. and waited for the gift of the Holy Spirit, Acts
   1:14, shows that they were ardent believers in the Lord by that time.

   James became pastor of the church at Jerusalem, took a leading part in
   the spreading of the gospel among the Jews and Gentiles, and did much
   to reconcile the strict Jews who thought that Christianity would tear
   down Judaism. So much did he love the ways of wisdom and peace that he
   was called, James "the Just." He was stoned to death in 62 A. D., on
   the charge that his doctrines superseded the Jewish law. Scripture
   references in regard to him will be found in Matthew 13:55; Mark
   3:21-31; John 2:12; 7:2-9; Acts 12:17; 21:18-25; Galatians 1:19,
   2:9-12.

   DATE, PLACE and OCCASION--About 60 A. D., from Jerusalem. The
   Christians to whom it was written had not ceased to be Jews. Many of
   them, converted at Pentecost, had carried home only a partial
   understanding of Christianity. on their enthusiasm at having found the
   true Messiah, they neglected Christian virtues, graces and works, and
   proclaimed everywhere that in order to be saved, all that was necessary
   was to believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messiah and Saviour.

   They also were in danger of sore discouragement because of the
   persecutions from unbelieving Jews.

   PURPOSE--To exhort Christians to show their faith by their works and to
   be patient under trials.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Patience.
    2. Dead Faith
    3. Tongue.
    4. Worldliness.

  Great Fact I. Patience in Trials.

   James 1.

   Rejoice when you are subject to various trials for this testing of your
   faith develops endurance, and when you can endure anything, you are
   altogether a mature Christian. When you need wisdom pray with
   confidence unto God, who never reproaches, but grants unto us freely.
   Let the brother of humble rank glory in his Christian dignity, and the
   rich in being poor of spirit. God tempts no man to dc wrong, but in
   every case a man is tempted by his own passions. Passions give birth to
   sin, and sin, when it is fully developed produces death. Instead of any
   wrong thing, it is the good and perfect gifts the come from above, from
   the Maker of tin lights in the heavens, who Himself is never subject to
   change or eclipse. Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to get
   angry for the anger of man does not further the righteous purposes of
   God. Put the gospel into practice, and be not merely listeners,
   deluding yourselves. If anyone is a hearer and not a practiser, he is
   like a man who looks at his face in a mirror, goes his way, and forgets
   what he is like. But he who looks carefully into the scriptures and
   practices them, will be blessed in what he does. If any one imagines
   himself to be religious, yet does not bridle his own tongue, he imposes
   upon his own conscience, and his religious observances are valueless.
   The religion that is pure in the eyes of our Father is this--to visit
   orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself uninfluenced
   by the world.

   LESSON--The world says. "Run from trials." Some sects say, "Ignore
   trials," but the Bible teaches, "Use your trials!" Many a time the
   people of God are bound with the cords of unworthy habits, until He
   throws them into the fiery furnace of affliction, and burns off their
   bonds. Failure often leads to success by rousing a man to more prayer
   and energy. Failure in a work for which a man is unfitted often brings
   him to his true place. Of a truth there is a paradise within a hedge of
   trials.

  Great Fact II. A Dead Faith Cannot Save.

   James 2.

   Christians should not try to combine faith in Christ with worship of
   rank, showing every consideration to the rich, and showing scant
   courtesy to the poor. God has chosen those who are poor in worldly
   goods to be rich in their faith,

   therefore, it is a sin to worship rank and insult the poor. By so doing
   one breaks that law which says, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself," and he who breaks the Law in one point breaks it in all, and
   justice will he merciless to him who has not practiced mercy. James
   2:1-13.

   What is the good of a man saying that he has faith if he does not prove
   it by his actions? Can such dead faith save him? Suppose a brother is
   in great distress for the want of food, and you should say, "Oh I am so
   sorry for you! Go away. I hope you will get warmed and fed elsewhere."
   What good would it do him? In the same way, faith that is not followed
   by actions is a lifeless thing.

   You do right to believe that there is one God, but demons have that
   much faith, and tremble at the thought. Remember how, in the case of
   Abraham, faith, and actions went together. Rahab, in like manner,
   showed her faith by righteous actions. Exactly as a body is dead
   without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.

   LESSONS--
    1. James Russel Lowell said, "We have gone on tar too long on the
       principle, I am as good as you,' this is a principle of selfishness
       that has made the world sick almost unto death. We should act
       rather on the other principle, You are as good as I,' for this is
       the note of brotherhood and of humility, which the Lord and his
       apostles first declared unto men."
    2. James dwells much on works, Paul on faith, Peter on hope, and John
       on love, but it takes a combination of all these graces to make up
       a true Christian life. Before men we are first recognized as
       Christians by our works; before God we are first recognized as
       Christians by our faith. Faith and works, like two oars in a
       rowboat, are both necessary if progress is to be made. Either one
       by itself would merely turn the boat around and around, and never
       get it to the shore, when we have both we are sure to get to the
       Haven of Rest. Faith should show itself in the works of
         1. 1. Confession, Romans 10:10;
         2. Baptism, Mark 16:16.
         3. Obedience, John 15:14.

  Great Fact III. True Faith Will Control the Tongue.

   James 3.

   Anyone who does not err when speaking is indeed a perfect man, able to
   restrain his whole body. When we put bits into the mouth of horses we
   control their whole bodies and even large ships are controlled by a
   very small rudder and steered In any direction the steersman may
   decide, so the tongue, small though it is, is a great boaster. As a
   tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze, so the tongue proves
   itself a very world of mischief; it infects the whole body, it sets all
   the affairs of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of
   the Pit. While all sorts of beasts have been tamed by man, no human
   being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague. It is charged with
   deadly poison! With it we praise God the Father, and with it we curse
   men who were made in His likeness! But this should not be so, for the
   wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving,
   gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free
   from partiality and insincerity. Indeed, righteousness shall abound in
   the lives of those who work for peace.

   LESSON--We should be constantly prayerful and careful to avoid those
   sins of the tongue, into which we are most in danger of falling, such
   as swearing. lying, tale-bearing and slander. On the other hand it is
   impossible to over-estimate the blessedness of that tongue that is ever
   ready to testify fog Christ, and to praise Him who is greatly to be
   praised!

  Great Facts IV. Worldliness Rebuked.

   James 4; James 5.

   The cause of quarrelling is found in the unholy desires within. Men
   fall to pray, or when they pray receive not because they ask with a
   wrong purpose, to spend what they get upon their pleasures. However, to
   be friends with the world means to be at enmity with God. Subject
   yourself therefore to God, and repel the Devil and he will flee from
   you. Brethren should not speak against one another, for he who
   disparages his brother defames the Law. It is wicked to boast Of what
   you will do tomorrow, for your life may disappear like a vapour. Rather
   say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that!" The rich
   should not oppress the poor or calamities will come upon them. If
   anyone is in trouble, let him pray; if anyone is happy, let him sing
   hymns; if anyone is sick, let him send for the officers of the church,
   and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name Of the
   Lord, and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will
   liaise him from his bed, and if he has committed sins, he will be
   forgiven.

   LESSONS--
    1. Satan has organized the world of unbelieving mankind upon
       principles of force, greed, selfishness, ambition and pleasure. The
       believer, however, should be crucified to the world and the world
       to him, Galatians 6:14. We should despise its pleasures, honours
       and treasures, and be unmoved by its threatenings or attractions.
    2. The officers of the church are to anoint the sick with oil, for oil
       is a symbol of the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit, the
       divine healer, Exodus 30:31; Acts 1:8; Mark 6:13. If the prayer of
       faith is offered in the spirit of Matthew 26:42, then God has
       promised to heal and forgive. The prayer of faith includes,
       however, confession of sin, humility, a surrendered will, and an
       earnest intention of consecrating to God's service the restored
       life. Nowhere in the Bible is the use of medicine forbidden, but
       the prayer of faith is enjoined.

    Questions on the Lesson.

    1. Give key word and key verse.

   WRITER--The Apostle Peter, who, before his conversion, was called
   Simon. He was a fisherman by occupation and lived first at Bethsaida on
   the Sea of Galilee, and afterwards at Capernaum. He was brought to
   Jesus by Andrew, his brother, and our Lord changed his name from Simon
   to Cephas, in Aramaic; or Peter, in Greek; which means "a rock." He
   became the leader of the apostles, and was always the spokesman. He was
   one of the three inner friends of Christ. At a time when men were
   calling Christ an imposter, Peter confessed that Jesus was the true
   Messiah and the Son of God, Matthew 16:16. His loyalty failed, however,
   at the crucial hour and he denied Christ, which lapse he repented of,
   Matthew 26:69-75. He preached the first gospel sermon at Pentecost,
   Acts 2. He wrought many miracles, journeyed much, preaching to the Jews
   in Palestine, Syria, and the countries around, and at last died a
   martyr to the faith by crucifixion under the Roman emperor, Nero. At
   his own request he was crucified head downward, reeling himself
   unworthy to resemble His Master in his death. He was courageous,
   hopeful, loving and faithful, and was one of the greatest men of the
   Bible.

   DATE--About 65 A. D., during Nero's Persecution.

   PLACE FROM WHICH WRITTEN--Babylon on the Euphrates. The place to which
   the Jews were taken in the captivity, and at which many remained.

   OCCASION--Trials and afflictions of the severest sort were coining upon
   the Christians from hostile Jews and fanatical Gentiles. Because the
   Christians would not join their heathen neighbours in their idolatry,
   wine-feasts and lusts, they were called "haters of the human race," and
   classed with thieves and murderers. A savage effort was made to
   suppress them altogether, and so great were the persecutions and trials
   that followed, that the apostle speaks of them as "fiery trials."

   PURPOSE--To hearten persecuted Christians with the grace of hope and to
   direct their thoughts to the glorious inheritance that awaits them.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Hope.
    2. Duties.
    3. Persecutions.

  Great Fact I. The Christian's Hope of Full Salvation.

   1 Peter 1:2-10.

   Blessed be God who has, in His great mercy, given us a new life of
   undying hope. A hope of an imperishable inheritance that awaits us when
   we are saved. not only from the guilt of sin, but from its very
   presence. We suffer for the moment from various trials, that the
   genuineness of our faith--a thing far more precious than gold--may be
   tested by fire, and may win praise and glory at Christ's appearing. It
   was this full salvation that the prophets desired to know about, and to
   know the time of its coming. With strictest self-control, fix your
   hopes on Christ's appearing. Do not be swayed by the passions of the
   old life, but rather live in a spirit of reverence, for it was not by
   perishable things such as silver and gold that you were redeemed from
   your ancestor's aimless way of living, but by the precious blood of the
   unblemished Lamb of God. Love one another earnestly with all your
   hearts. Abandon all vice and deceit, pretence, envy and slandering, and
   like new-born babies crave the pure spiritual milk of the Word that you
   may grow thereby. While many stumble because they do not accept the
   gospel, yet you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a consecrated
   nation, God's own people, so that you may display the virtues of Him
   who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.

   LESSON--The gospel hope is a living hope because it invigorates the
   Christian and helps to keep him alive amid fiery trials. The delusive
   hopes of the unregenerated are vain and perishing, while the hypocrite
   and his hope both die together, Job 27:8. The believer, therefore,
   hopes for:--
    1. All the blessings of full salvation.
    2. The coming of Christ.
    3. The resurrection of the body.
    4. Eternal reward for his faithfulness.

   Let us then be always hopeful and glad in expectation of the good
   things God has promised.

  Great Facts II. The Christian's Duties.

   1 Peter 2:11 to 1 Peter 4:11

   Refrain from indulging in the cravings of your earthly nature for they
   make war upon the soul. Let your daily life be upright, that evil-doers
   as they watch You may learn to praise God. Submit to properly
   constituted authorities for the Lord's sake, for it is God's will that
   you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is
   right. Servants should obey their masters with respect, not only those
   who are good and considerate, but also those who are arbitrary. Wives
   should submit to their husbands, so that if any of them reject the
   gospel, they may be won over by the blameless conduct of their wives.
   Christians should be united, sympathetic, kind hearted, humble minded;
   never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, hut on the contrary
   blessing.

   Who can harm you if you prove yourselves eager for what is good? Even
   if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourself blessed! Do not
   let men terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed. Christ Himself
   died to atone for sins once for all--the good on behalf of the
   bad--that He might bring you to God, having been physically put to
   death, but spiritually living, It was Christ's Spirit, who in the days
   of Noah, preached to those whose spirits are now in prison. At that
   time a few were saved by the Ark rising above the water, and water
   typifies the cleansing that comes through a crucified Saviour, 1 John
   1:7.

   Surely in times past you have spent time enough living as the ungodly
   delight to live, for you have lived among scenes of debauchery, revelry
   and profane idolatry, and because you do not practice these things now
   men wonder at you and malign you. But they will have to answer for
   their conduct to Him who is ready to judge both the living and the
   dead.

   LESSONS--The apostle gives us an excellent prescription for a happy
   life in an ill-natured world. He quotes Psalm 34:12-14, which is as
   true for our times as it was for David's. The best way of making this
   life comfortable and prosperous is to refrain from evil speaking and
   slandering, and t be ever ready to overcome evil with good

  Great Fact III. The Christian's Persecutions and Trials.

   1 Peter 4:12 to 1 Peter 5:14.

   Do not be astonished at the fiery trials that you are passing through,
   as though something strange were happening to you, for the more you
   share the sufferings of Christ the more you will share His glory. Count
   yourselves blessed when you are abused for Christ's sake, for that
   shows that the Spirit of God is resting upon you. Of course no one
   among you should suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or
   for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians, but if a
   man suffers for Christian principles he should not be ashamed. The
   right place to begin judgement is at the house of God, and if first
   with us what will be the end of those who reject the gospel? If a
   righteous man is saved only with difficulty what will become of the
   godless and sinful? Therefore, let those who suffer because God wills
   it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and
   persevere in doing right.

   LESSON--A Christian should not be bewildered and shocked by the fiery
   trials that come, His religion does not exempt him from pain,
   misfortunes, bereavement, or death. Besides this, evil men will
   persecute the true Christian, because the flippant dislike the earnest,
   the unclean are angry with the pure, the lovers of error hate the
   lovers of truth. However, the Christian should rejoice under
   sufferings, because they make him like Christ, and they will be the
   cause of exceeding joy when He shall crown His faithful servants.

LESSON THEME:--2 PETER

   2 Peter 1:4-8.
     * KEY WORD--"KNOWLEDGE."
     * KEY VERSE--2 Peter 3:18.
     * KEY PHRASE--"GROW IN GRACE AND SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE."

   WRITER--The Apostle Peter. Addressed to Christians in general.

   PLACE OF WRITING--Uncertain, but probably Babylon.

   DATE--About 67 A. D., a short time before his martyrdom. Second Timothy
   and Second Peter have much in common. Both Paul and Peter were facing a
   cruel death at the time they wrote them, yet both epistles are full of
   hope and joy, and both urge faithfulness amid errors and suffering.

   PURPOSE--To show that the best way to guard against false teachings is
   to grow in grace and in full knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Virtues.
    2. Transfiguration.
    3. Warning.
    4. Defence.

  Great Fact I. The Great Christian Virtues.

   2 Peter 1:1-12.

   God has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we
   advance in knowledge of Him. Through His goodness He has given us
   exceedingly great and precious promises, that through them we might
   partake of the divine nature, having fled from the corruption that is
   in the world through human passions. Therefore, supplement your faith
   by goodness, goodness by full knowledge, knowledge by self-control,
   self-control by endurance , endurance by piety, piety by kindliness,
   kindliness by love, for when these virtues are yours in increasing
   measure, you will have a fuller knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
   the man who has not these virtues is short sighted even to blindness,
   and forgets that he has been purified from his past sins. Therefore, do
   your best to put God's call and election of you beyond all doubt, for
   if you do this you will never fail, but have a triumphant entrance into
   the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   LESSON--Here, Peter agrees with Paul in urging Christians not to remain
   babes in Christ by halting and faltering around the first stages of
   Christian experience, but to grow and to be ever growing. We are to add
   grace to grace until our virtues are multiplied, and this for two
   reasons:--
    1. That we might have a fuller knowledge of our blessed Lord. Not
       knowing ABOUT Him, or TECHNICAL knowledge of Him, but an INTIMATE
       PERSONAL knowledge that gives the joy of fellowship, power to
       conquer, and likeness to His own blessed Self, Philippians 3:10.
    2. That we might have an abundant entrance into the eternal kingdom.
       Not getting into harbour with sails torn, dismasted, and towed in
       by a salvage tug, but with every mast standing, every sail set, a
       valuable cargo in good shape, and precious passengers all safe,
       with waving flags, and greeted by the playing bands and booming
       batteries of the Fair Haven of Rest! To have such an abundant
       entrance to the life eternal should be the holy ambition of every
       Christian.

  Great Fact II. The Transfiguration and the Teaching of the Prophets.

   2 Peter 1:13-21.

   As long as my soul tabernacles in my body I will awaken in your
   memories of the past, that after my departure you may call these truths
   to mind. We were not telling you fairy stories when we told you of the
   coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ, for we were eye witnesses of
   His glory. Indeed, when we were with Him on the sacred mountain He
   received honour and glory from the Father, and a voice declared "This
   is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," Matthew 17:5. And still
   stronger is the assurance that we have in the teachings of the
   prophets, to which you will do well to pay attention, recognizing that
   no prophecy of scripture can be interpreted by man's unaided reason,
   for no prophetic teaching ever came at the mere wish of man, but men,
   moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

   LESSONS--Peter is here teaching that there was a sense in which the
   Transfiguration set forth Christ's Second Coming, because, as outlined
   by Dr. Scofield:--
    1. Christ was not then the Messiah in rejection, but the Lord in
       Heavenly glory.
    2. Moses in a glorified state, was a type of the redeemed who will
       pass through death into the kingdom.
    3. Elijah is a type of the redeemed who will enter the kingdom by
       translation, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.
    4. Peter, James and John, not glorified, are a type of the Jews who
       will not share the Lord's glory at the time of His Coming. Ezekiel
       37:21.
    5. The multitude at the foot of the mountain are a type of the
       nations, who will be brought into the kingdom after it has been set
       up over the Jews, Isaiah 11:9-12.

   Peter saw the Second Coming unfolded in the Transfiguration, but he
   teaches that we are not dependent on what he saw. We have the surer
   word of prophecy, the unerring Word of God. It is like a lamp shining
   in a dark place, but soon the day will dawn, the day of fulfilment, and
   then we shall know AIL about these things as God knows ALL about us.

  Great Fact III Warnings Against False Teachings.

   2 Peter 2.

   The apostle here warns against the Gnostics who taught that Christ was
   not equal with the Father. That the soul does not sin, so it does not
   matter if the body gets drunk or goes into sin, one can do just as one
   pleases because we are not under moral law. Such were the false
   teachings of these people who set themselves up against the apostles,
   and for money taught doctrines that were pleasant rather than true.

   In reply, Peter points out that whoever goes into sin or teaches heresy
   shall certainly be punished. That God did not even spare the angels who
   sinned, but is keeping them under guard for judgement. That He sent the
   Flood upon a godless world in the days of Noah. That He reduced Sodom
   and Gomorrah to ashes as a warning to the godless of what was in store
   for them. The apostle then vividly describes how these wicked teachers
   malign even the apostles that God had appointed, and they entice weak
   souls by promising them freedom while in reality they are making them
   slaves of corrupt habits. Peter has in mind Zechariah 3:1-2; where the
   high priest was seeking to rebuild the temple. Satan, however, appeared
   before God, and said the people were not worthy of having the temple
   restored, and then accused and reviled the high priest. The angel of
   the Lord, however did not make a railing accusation against Satan as
   Satan had against the high priest, but calmly said, "God rebuke thee."
   But said Peter, while angels who excel men in power, would not make
   bitter accusations, yet these wicked teachers malign those of whom they
   know nothing, but they will assuredly perish with their own corruption.

   LESSONS--
    1. Many evil spirits are abroad, and the credentials they display are
       gifts of the mind, or truths beautiful or original. We should,
       however, be as cautious as the saint in the legend. When an evil
       spirit showed himself radiant with royal robes and crowned with a
       jewelled diadem and said, "I am the Christ, follow me!" The saint
       thought and looked awhile and said, "I will not believe that you
       are the Christ unless you show me the wounds of the Cross!" and the
       evil spirit fled. So any religious teacher that does not centre all
       his doctrines around the Cross should be driven from the life.
    2. Like the angels we should not publish the faults of our fellowmen,
       and mingle reproaches with accusations, but leave the wicked to the
       Lord who will avenge all injustice.

  Great Fact IV. A DEFENCE of the Second Coming.

   2 Peter 3.

   Here the apostle divides the history of the world into three sections
   and mentions some of the characteristics of each.
    1. The old world, 2 Peter 3:6. The world which the Flood overwhelmed.
       The scoffers said, "Where is the promise of His coming?" From the
       beginning of creation, Nature has pursued the even tenor of its
       way. There has been no sign of any change, and no change is
       possible. The promise of His coming fails!" But Peter reminds the
       sceptics that a Mighty flood did drown the world, therefore their
       mocking question is foolish.
    2. The present world, 2 Peter 3:7. He asserts that the present world
       contains within itself the agency by which it may be consumed. It
       is held in store not for a second flood but for fire. Stored up
       within the earth are oils and gases, which when released by God
       shall cause such physical revolutions as shall transform this
       planet into something more glorious. Therefore, what holy lives we
       ought to lead while we await and hasten the coming of the Day of
       God.
    3. The new world, 2 Peter 3:13. This is the Paradise restored of
       Revelation 21:1. Where we are told that He who created the world,
       will recreate it, clearing it of every vestige of sin, misery and
       imperfection, fitting it for the dwelling place of perfect beings,
       and for His own glorious presence. In expectation of these things
       we are to make every effort to be found by Him, spotless, blameless
       and at peace. The delay in the fulfilment of these things should be
       regarded as forbearance on the part of the Lord, in seeking to
       bring more to salvation.

   LESSON--Too often men have set one time for deliverance, and God
   another, but He will not fail to keep the day He has appointed. In
   Exodus 12:41; we see that God kept His engagement to the very day to
   deliver Israel out of Egypt. What men count slackness is truly
   forbearance upon the part of God. Enthusiastic impatience must be
   checked. God is still saying to the unconverted, "How shall I give thee
   up!" and as He sees the unfruitful Christians, He says. "Let them alone
   this year also." Let us then not abuse the patience and long-suffering
   of God by abandoning ourselves to a course of impenitence of
   worldliness's, for the Lord shall come suddenly, and at a most unlikely
   time, and the cry shall ring out, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh!"
   Matthew 25:6.

     * Saturday--Walking in the truth, 3 John.

   WRITER--John, the apostle who wrote also the fourth gospel and
   Revelation.

   DATE and PLACE--Soon after the fourth gospel, about 90 A. D., while
   John was pastor at Ephesus.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--The first epistle to the churches in general, the
   second, to "the elect lady and her children," the third, to a devout
   Christian named Gains.

   OCCASION--Three classes of heretics had sprung up by this time.
    1. The Edomites, who denied that Christ was really divine.
    2. The Docetists, who said He was truly divine, but that He had no
       human side to His nature.
    3. The Corinthians, who claimed that Christ was not perfectly human
       and perfectly divine until after His baptism. These errors
       concerning the person of Christ were unsettling believer's faith in
       and fellowship with the Lord.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To set forth the true doctrine that Christ was perfectly divine and
       Perfectly human.
    2. To teach how they may know that they have eternal life, and rejoice
       in full assurance of the truth.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Light.
    2. Righteousness.
    3. Love.
    4. Truth.
    5. Fellow-Helpers.

  Great Fact I. God Is Light.

   1 John 1:2-28.

   John's first message is that God is Light, and walking with Him in the
   light means fellowship with Him, and with one another, and the blood of
   Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin. We may know that we are walking
   in the light if we lay His commands to heart, especially the
   commandment to love the brethren. This keeping of God's commandments,
   however, is inconsistent with the love of the world and with fellowship
   with false teachers. Walking in the light and abiding in Christ is the
   only hope of safety, for in Him we have eternal life.

   LESSON--The world under Satan's dominion is in spiritual darkness and
   death. Unspiritual people are blinded and have no light from heaven
   upon their daily pathway. We are commanded, however, to walk in the
   light, because:--
    1. Light is purity, but darkness is impurity.
    2. Light is love, but darkness is hatred.
    3. Light is truth. but darkness is falsehood.
    4. Light is peace but darkness is fear.

  Great Fact II. God is Righteousness.

   1 John 2:28 to 1 John 4:6.

   The apostle's second message is that God is righteous, therefore,
   fellowship with Him depends on doing righteousness. He who lives
   sinfully belongs to the devil for he has sinned from the beginning, but
   the MOTIVE for living righteously is, that when we see Christ we shall
   be like Him, 1 John 3:2. The TEST of whether we are living righteously
   is whether we love the brethren, 1 John 3:14. Everyone who hates his
   brother is a murderer, and a murderous temper excludes him from eternal
   life. The REWARD for living righteously is a full assurance of
   salvation. Over forty times John uses the word "know" in his epistles,
   because true religion is more than doctrine, something must be known
   and felt! We KNOW that Christ was manifested to take away our sins. We
   KNOW we have passed from death unto life. We KNOW that whatsoever we
   ask we shall receive of God. We KNOW that we are in union with Christ
   and He with us, because He has given Ili some measure of His Spirit.

   LESSON--The apostle is here contrasting one who lives a life of
   righteousness with one who lives a life of sin, and in 1 John 3:9 he
   teaches that the truly regenerated man does not continually practice
   sin. It is one thing for a Christian because of a strong temptation to
   temporarily fall into sin, and the divine remedy for this is seen in 1
   John 1:9. But if a Christian continually practices a sin he may well
   doubt his conversion. We should be as serious in our attitude towards
   sin as is God. He gave a Law to condemn it, a Saviour to redeem from
   it, a Spirit to destroy it, a gospel to testify against it, and a whole
   family of new-born sons to be living witnesses of His deliverances from
   its power.

  Great Fact III. God. Is Love.

   1 John 4:7 to 1 John 5:21.

   We are called sons through the love of the Father, 1 John 3:1, and He
   manifested that love by sending His Son to be an atoning sacrifice of
   our sins, 1 John 4:10. We should show our love to Him by loving one
   another, 1 John 4:7. He who loves has fellowship with God, 1 John 4:16.
   But the absence of love destroys this fellowship, 1 John 4:19-21.
   Victory over the world comes only through love and faith in Jesus
   Christ, whose coming was attested to by water and by blood, and by the
   Spirit. Yea, God Himself testifies that His Son came into the world, 1
   John 5:9. In Christ we not only overcome the world, but have eternal
   life, 1 John 5:13.

   LESSON--We have not seen the greatest gift of all--the heart of God,
   the love of His heart, the heart of His love, and yet when we look at
   the cross we have a glimpse of it. The Cross was the only way God had
   of showing us His heart. It was Infinite Love striving to reveal
   itself, seeking to pour out its fullness. Christ did not die that God
   might love men. He died because God had from everlasting to
   everlastingly loved man, the Cross is not the cause, but the effect of
   the love of God. It is not even necessary that we should be worthy for
   God to love us. He loves us because of Himself. We are saved by grace.
   Our salvation does not depend upon what we are, but upon what God
   is--and God is love!

  Great Fact IV. God Is Truth.

   2 John 1.

   John here declares his joy at finding some guided by the Truth. Walking
   in truth is to love one another, but this love is manifested in keeping
   God's commandments, and in steadfast loyalty to the genuine doctrine of
   the gospel. There are many imposterness in the world, but whoever in
   the name of progress departs from Christ's teachings possesses not God.
   One should not extend any hospitality or show any friendliness to false
   teachers for by doing so one shares in their wicked work, II John.

   LESSON--To countenance a teacher of error, to wish him God-speed, is to
   approve his evil works and to share his guilt. We are "partakers of
   other men's sins," not only when we take their side of the question,
   but also when we keep silent instead of condemning them.

  Great Fact V. God Needs Fellow-Workers.

   3 John 1.

   John had sent out some preachers with letters of commendation to the
   various churches, and among others to that of which Gaius and
   Diotrephes were members. Diotrephes, however, through jealousy or some
   other personal reason, declined to receive these preachers and exerted
   his authority to make the church act the same way, even threatening to
   exclude those who differed from him in the matter. Gains alone had not
   been intimidated, but had welcomed to his home the repulsed preachers,
   who, when they returned to the church at Ephesus, testified of his
   courage and kindness. John hoped soon to visit the church and bring the
   proud Diotrephes to account for his overbearing conduct.

   LESSONS--
    1. Preachers going forth for the sake of the Name, whether at home or
       abroad, should be welcomed and entertained worthily by churches and
       Individuals. By such action, one shares in the missionary's labours
       and becomes a fellow-helper.
    2. Churches should not encourage those who are eager for pre-eminence
       in the church, and who insist on having their own arbitrary way. A
       healthy and happy church is one in which every member esteems each
       other more highly than himself, Philippians 2:3.

      Lesson No. 63--Consecutive Bible study is one of our best blessings

LESSON THEME:--JUDE

   Jude 1:1-4.
     * KEY WORD--"ASSURANCE."
     * KEY VERSE--Jude 1:3, Last Clause.
     * KEY PHRASE--"EARNESTLY CONTEND FOR THE FAITH."

   Home Readings.

   Notice how much Jude is like Second Peter. They both had the same evils
   with which to contend.

   For family altar read:--
     * Sunday--Contend earnestly for the faith,--Jude 1:1-7.
     * Monday--False teachers and their doom,--Jude 1:8-16.
     * Tuesday--Build, pray keep, look,--Jude 1:17-25.
     * Wednesday--God will not spare false prophets, 2 Peter 2:1-8.
     * Thursday--Wrong doing shall receive its reward,--2 Peter 2:9-16.
     * Friday--Unsaved professors will get entangled with the world again.
       2 Peter 2:1-22.
     * Saturday--There will be scoffers, 2Peter 3:1-9.

   WRITER--Jude or Judas, the brother of the Lord and of James, who wrote
   the epistle that bears his name, Mark 6:3. Neither James nor Jude hint
   at their relationship to Jesus, their unaffected humility kept them
   silent.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--It is called a general epistle because it is not
   addressed to any particular person or church but to Christians in
   general.

   DATE and PLACE--It was written in Palestine, probably after 2 Peter,
   about 68 A. D.

   OCCASION--Jude had heard, likely from a traveling evangelist, of the
   serious spiritual dangers that were besetting some of his fellow
   believers.

   PURPOSE--To exhort Christians to earnestly contend for the faith.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Contend.
    2. Examples.
    3. Build.

  Great Fact I. Contend Earnestly for the Faith.

   Jude 1:1-4.

   Jude, while writing about our common salvation, was impelled to urge
   the "Beloved of God the Father" to tight in defence of the Faith that
   has once for all been entrusted to the saints. For there had crept in
   stealthily among them certain godless people, who had made the mercy of
   God an excuse for vicious living, and disowned our only Lord and
   Master, Jesus Christ.

   LESSON--
    1. The Faith referred to is that body of gospel and church truth
       contained in the scriptures.
    2. The Faith was delivered by God and not discovered by man.
    3. The Faith was delivered "once for all." No other faith will ever be
       given. Although the truth may be stated in new terms, no new
       doctrines are to be added to the present body of truth.
    4. We may contend for the faith by maintaining that all scripture is
       given by the inspiration of God, 2 Timothy 3:16; and by shaping all
       our religious beliefs and practices strictly according to its holy
       teachings.

  Great Fact II. Examples of Divine Vengeance.

   Jude 1:5-19.

   Jude here gives three examples of God's punishment of collective
   wickedness:--
    1. He destroyed the Israelites whom He had delivered from Egypt,
       because they refused to believe in Him.
    2. The angels who kept not their first state of holiness. He Is
       keeping under guard in the spirit-land of darkness for the great
       Day of Judgement.
    3. Sodom and Gomorrah, who gave themselves up to foul sensuality, are
       undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

   In spite of these solemn examples there are troublers of the churches
   who despise authority, and sneer at sacred things of which they know
   nothing, all because they themselves are corrupt.

   They are like three wicked men of old who called forth divine
   vengeance. Like Cain, who rejected redemption by blood, like Balaam,
   who was a hireling prophet, anxious only to make money. Like Koran, who
   took honours unto himself by intruding upon the priest's office.

   These present evil men are selfish, empty, fruitless and Godless, ever
   complaining of their lot, and ever flattering men for the sake of what
   they can get out 01 them. We should not, however, be surprised at
   finding such men, for the apostle' foretold us they would come.

   LESSONS--
    1. Every Christian ought to know the Bible in order to know how God
       deals with men. We should often reread it and not trust to memory,
       for memory is often "like a sieve which holds the bran and lets
       flour go."
    2. God deals first in mercy but afterwards in judgement. The world,
       like the wilderness of old, is strewn with the graves of those who
       were offered high privileges, but who turned their backs upon God's
       mercies and became their own worst enemies.
    3. God will not spare sinners, whether in low or high places, for He
       spared not the angels, but as soon as they developed an evil nature
       He saw they were not fit for the holiness and joys of heaven, and
       cast them out. "It is hard to be high and not high minded!"
    4. Troublers of the churches are like dreamers. They live in an unreal
       world and have no true idea of the serious nature of sin. They are
       insensible to all the warnings of coming judgement. They are
       unconscious of the dangers that threaten their immortal souls.

  Great Fact III. Build Up Our Own Spiritual Lives.

   Jude 1:20-25.

   If others will be unspiritual, yet we should build up our characters on
   the foundation of our most holy faith, praying under the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit, and keeping within the love of God, while waiting for
   the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring us into the eternal state.
   To those who are in doubt, show piety and save them from the fire. To
   others show pity, but with caution, hating the very clothing polluted
   by their touch.

   Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling, and to bring you
   into His glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing, to the only God,
   our Saviour, be glory, majesty dominion and power as it was before time
   began is now, and ever shall be for all time to come, Amen.

   LESSONS--Having laid well our foundation in gospel faith, we must build
   upon it, or be ever making progress in spiritual things. This is what
   Paul meant when he said, "Grow in grace." We can build ourselves no
   by:--
    1. Praying in the Holy Spirit. He make our prayers fervent, for cold
       prayers ask the Lord not to hear them. He makes them loving because
       all prayers should be perfumed by love to our fellowmen and to
       Christ. He makes them believing, for a man prevails only as he has
       faith.
    2. Keeping ourselves in the love of God. This will keep our own love
       deeply stirred, and keep us from error and worldliness.
    3. Waiting for the Lord's mercy. The blessed hope of final happiness
       and reward will make us faithful in the discharge of all our
       duties, and patient in bearing our trials.

    Questions on the Lesson.

    1. Give key word and key verse.
    2. Tell about the writer.
    3. What the date and place of writing?
    4. To whom was it written?

    6. What the purpose?
    7. Name the great facts.
    8. What the meaning here of the word Faith?
    9. Who gave us the faith?
   10. Will any new faith be given?
   11. How may we contend for it?
   12. Give the three examples of collective wickedness.
   13. What were the troublers of the churches doing?
   14. What three wicked men were they like?

   20. In what three ways may we build characters?
   21. What the advantage of praying in the Holy Spirit?

LESSON THEME:--REVELATION

     * KEYWORD--"FINALTHINGS."
     * KEYVERSE--Revelation 1:1.
     * KEY PHRASE--"FINAL JUDGEMENTS AND GLORY."

   Home Readings.

   It would help much if you would read Revelation through in the
   Twentieth Century NOW Testament, or in the Author's Self Explaining
   Edition of Revelation.

   For family alter read:--
     * Sunday--The Lord appears to give the Revelation,--Revelation
       1:9-20.
     * Monday--Urgent messages to the churches,--Revelation 2:1-11.
     * Tuesday--Some of the events of the Tribulation,--Revelation 6:1-7.

       dead,--Revelation 20.
     * Saturday--The blessedness of the eternal future,--Revelation
       21:1-10.

   WRITER--The apostle John. It is remarkable that John the Beloved, who
   was nearer to the heart of Christ than any other, he who filled his
   gospel and epistles with the warmth of divine love, should be the
   chosen vessel to make known the most terrible judgements. This at
   least, suggests that he would not over-draw the picture.

   TO WHOM WRITTEN--The seven churches of Asia Minor, and through them to
   all churches.

   DATE and PLACE--Likely 96 A. D., from the Isle of Patmos, to which John
   was banished for being a Christian preacher by Emperor Domitian of
   Rome.

   OCCASION--There was a bitter persecution of the Christians in Asia, and
   the last of the apostles was about to go to his re. ward. It was
   therefore very fitting that God should use him to draw the veil of the
   future, that man might know of this crisis that should afterward come
   to pass.

   PURPOSE--
    1. To describe the wonderful events connected with the end of the age.
    2. To encourage Christians to be faithful by giving them an inspired
       picture of Christ's final triumph over all evil.

GREAT FACTS:--

    1. Introduction.
    2. Churches.
    3. Tribulation.
    4. Second Coining.
    5. New Things.

  Great Fact I. The Introductory Vision.

   Revelation 1.
    1. God is the source of the Revelation, Christ was the channel through
       whom it was given, an angel interpreted it, John recorded it, the
       churches were to proclaim it, and there is a special divine
       blessing promised to those who read and heed its sayings. The time
       for the fulfilment of its prophecies is always to be regarded as
       near at hand.
    2. On the Lord's Day, while under the special influence of the Holy
       Spirit, John had a vision of the Glorified Lora, who appeared with
       priestly robe, yet with kingly glory, walking among the churches,
       observing and cherishing them. John was bidden not to fear, but to
       write down the things concerning the churches, and the things that
       should afterward take place.

   LESSON--While we cannot understand all about this remarkable book nor
   be certain about all of its interpretations, yet we should study it,
   keep its truths in our memories and practice its doctrines, for it is a
   window of hope through which we look into eternity, and the only book
   in the Bible that promises a blessing to those who study it.

  Great Fact I. The Message to the Churches.

   Revelation 2; Revelation 3.

   The number of the churches is seven, and each message has seven
   parts:--
    1. Name of church.
    2. Mention of some sublime attribute of speaker.
    3. An assertion that Christ knows all about the duties and doings of
       each church.
    4. A description of the state of each, with praise or blame.
    5. A reference to His promised coming.
    6. A command to give special attention to what the spirit says.
    7. Promises to those who overcome.

   Notice what the Lord knows about the churches: "I know thy faith,
   works, love and ministry." I know if their last works are better than
   the first. Knows all about their persecutions, and outward poverty,
   although spiritually they were rich in faith, hope and love.

   Notice what the Lord holds against the churches. Some had left their
   first love and were acting as though they were rich, although
   spiritually they were paupers, another had a reputation for being a
   living church, yet was almost dead. Another had in its fellowship those
   who were unsound in doctrines and wicked in life. From all such our
   Lord said He would turn away in disgust.

   Notice what the Lord promises to the churches. Overcomers shall be
   readmitted to Paradise and the Tree of Life from which Adam was
   excluded. They shall triumph over afflictions and escape death. The
   door to the storehouse of God's manna shall be opened unto them. They
   shall reign over the nations. They shall have a robe and a crown, and
   indeed enjoy the same honours in Heaven that Christ enjoys.

   LESSON--These inspired promises give a many sided view of the future
   possessions of the saints. Taken together, they give the completest
   description of the World of God of the good things God has prepared for
   those who love Him. How they should quicken our faith, kindle hope, and
   inspire zeal.

  Great Fact III. The Judgements and Events That Will Immediately Precede
  Christ's Second Coming.

   Revelation 4; Revelation 5; Revelation 6; Revelation 7; Revelation 8;
   Revelation 9;
   Revelation 10; Revelation 11; Revelation 12; Revelation 13; Revelation
   14; Revelation 15;
   Revelation 16; Revelation 17; Revelation 18.

   This is the Great Tribulation of three and a half years of plagues,
   trials and judgement spoken of in Jeremiah 30:7; as the time of
   Israel's trouble, Spoken of by Christ as a Great Tribulation such as
   never was before, Matthew 24:21, and referred to by many others.

   The causes of the Tribulation are:--
    1. The special working of Satan, who will have great wrath because his
       time is short:--
    2. Unprecedented activity of demons. At Christ's first coming they
       sought to control men, causing them to Blaspheme and to resist God;
       they will again afflict men with mental and spiritual diseases.
    3. Satan will incarnate himself in the Anti-Christ. Daniel refers to
       him in ; Revelation 12:11. Christ in Matthew 24:15. Paul in 2
       Thessalonians 2:3; and John in Revelation 13:1, etc. This
       Anti-Christ will appropriate divine honours, imitate Christ,
       appoint false prophets, overcome nations. He and the false prophets
       will be cast into the Lake of Fire at Christ's coming.
    4. There will be plagues similar to the plagues of Egypt. Plagues of
       blood, hail, fire, locusts, darkness, famine, sores, earthquakes,
       war, martyrdoms and death. As before the purpose will be to
       discredit the religion of the ungodly and direct them to the true
       and living God.
    5. The gathering of the nations to the battle or Armageddon under the
       Anti-Christ and false prophet. In great wrath they will be
       besieging Jerusalem, when they will be alarmed by the signs of
       Christ's coming, and will be smitten with a sudden blow from which
       they will never recover.
    6. The judgement of the nations as to the treatment they have accorded
       to God's people, the Jews, Matthew 25:31-46.

   LESSONS--Before these terrible events shall come to pass, the saints
   will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, 1 Thessalonians 4:17.
   How earnest we should be to be found in Him, for rebellion against Him
   is death. Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker.

  Great Fact IV. The Second Coining and the MILLENNIUM.

   Revelation 19; Revelation 20:6.

   The prophets and apostles made Christ's Coming the blessed hope of
   Israel and the church. They taught that He would strike down the wicked
   nations, gather Israel to its own land, set up His government upon the
   throne of David, reign in justice and be King of all.

   Whether the Lord will come before or after the Millennium has stirred
   the faithful for all generations, and perhaps orthodox Christians are
   about evenly divided. The Post-Millenialists think that the processes
   of education, and the preaching of the gospel will bring universal
   peace and make men spiritual and holy. The Pre-Millenialists, with whom
   the writer joins, believe that it will take the coming of the King, the
   literal restraining of Satan before universal righteousness will
   prevail. The reasons for this position are:--
    1. The Anti-Christ is to be destroyed, not gradually, but by His
       coming, 2 Thessalonians 2:8.
    2. The Son of Man comes IMMEDIATELY after the Tribulation, Matthew
       24:29, there is nothing said of a Millennium between the
       Tribulation and His coming.
    3. The world will be in a mixed condition when the Lord comes, not all
       saved. There will be "wheat and tares," Matthew 13:38-40. There
       will be unconverted as in the days of Noah, Matthew 24:37. These
       verses do not point to a Millennium of universal righteousness
       BEFORE Christ comes.

   The destruction of the Anti-Christ, the restraint of Satan, and the
   return of the Lord Jesus, will usher in the Millennium.
    1. There will be universal peace. Men will beat their swords into
       plough shares, Isaiah 2:4.
    2. There will be a Paradise condition in the earth so that the lion
       shall lie down with the lamb, etc., Isaiah 11:6. There will be a
       great spread of knowledge, Isaiah 11:9. All prophecies of the
       earthly glory of Jews will be fulfilled in this age. All promises
       in the Sermon on the Mount, like "The meek shall inherit the earth"
       will find their fruition.

   LESSON--The Second Coming is mentioned from one end of the Bible to the
   other. In the New Testament there are 300 references to it. It is bound
   up with every sublime promise of likeness to Christ, satisfaction of
   soul, victory over sin and Satan and death, and the deliverance of the
   earth from bondage and corruption. Are we exhorted to meet together on
   the Lord's day, or to take the Lord's Supper, it is in order to "show
   forth His death until He comes." Are we exhorted to love one another,
   or to be holy, it is in view of His coming! Yea, it is the central
   chord of all vital Christian life! Dr. Broaddus said, "If I am always
   ready to meet Him, am bound to be ready when He comes."

  Great Fact V. The Last judgement and the Seven New Things.

   Revelation 20:7 to end.
    1. Here we have the judgement of the Great White Throne set up after
       the Millennium, before which will be judged the unbelieving dead.
       The righteous rose before the thousand years and lived and reigned
       with Christ, Revelation 20:4.
    2. The unjust are now judged by the things written in the books, and
       awarded different degrees of punishment according to their words.

   The apostle now has a glimpse of the blessed things of the eternal
   future, and reveals that there will be at least seven new things.
    1. A renewed heaven. There will be no more death-dealing thunder bolts
       of lightning flashes from the sky.
    2. A renewed earth. No more weeds or snakes, no more slums or
       hospitals or graves.
    3. No more nationalities for that is what we believe is meant by "no
       more sea." All men shall speak one tongue and brothers be.
    4. The capital of the Heavenly world shall be the New Jerusalem, whose
       beauty and glory will be beyond compare.
    5. New peoples, for God shall dwell with them, and they will never
       weep, never suffer, never sorrow, never die, for the former things
       are passed away.
    6. New sanctuary, no particular place will have a temple, for the
       presence of God and of the Lamb will make every part of it a
       sanctuary.
    7. A new Paradise, with its crystal river, and the tree of life
       yielding its fruit of complete blessedness. There will be no more
       nurse, and no night there, for the Lord God will give them light,
       and they shall serve Him, and see His face and be known by Him, and
       they shall reign forever and forever.

   LESSON--The last verses of Revelation are full of the sunshine and
   music of the word "NEW." "Behold, I make all things new." We should
   study more the Bible teachings about Heaven, and remember that upon
   every stone of its walls, and above its pearly gates is inscribed the
   word "GRACE!" "Grace!" All who enter and forever enjoy its bliss will
   do so by God's wondrous grace! As travellers often layup rich treasures
   of pictures, statuary, vases, etc., to place in their homes upon their
   return, so let us lay up as treasures for heaven, faithful service and
   noble sacrifices!

GREAT FACTS:--

   Periods of History, Period of:--
    1. Christ.
    2. Peter.
    3. Paul.
    4. Other Apostles.

  Great Fact I. Period of Christ's Life and Ministry. 4 B. C.-30 A. D.

   Augustus was emperor of Rome, and Judea was a Roman province with Herod
   as its king, when Jesus was born 4 B. C. The calendar was changed to
   date from Christ's birth through the efforts of Gregory, but it was
   afterwards found that a mistake of about four years was made; Christ's
   birth is therefore dated 4 B. C.

   1. CHRIST'S BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD.--
    1. The angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would give birth to
       the Saviour.
    2. Jesus was born at Bethlehem.
    3. Was visited and worshipped by the shepherds and the wise men.
    4. Was secretly taken down into Egypt to avoid death at the slaying of
       the babies by Herod, and after two years returned to live at
       Nazareth.
    5. Nothing is recorded of Him again until in His twelfth year He went
       with His parents to the Temple and in His reply to His mother
       showed that He was conscious of His divine mission.

   2. HIS MINISTRY--Nothing more is recorded until He reached His
   thirteenth year, when:--
    1. John the Baptist announced the coming of the Messiah.
    2. He was baptised by John.
    3. Was tempted by Satan in the wilderness for 40 days.
    4. He called His twelve disciples.
    5. Cleansed the temple by driving out the traders and platters.
    6. He taught Nicodemus about the new birth.
    7. He preached to the woman at the well of Samaria.
    8. Was rejected by His fellow-citizens at Nazareth.
    9. Wrought many miracles and cured many that were sick, proving
       Himself to be the Son of God.
   10. Preached the Sermon on the Mount, the most wonderful religious
       teaching in the world.
   11. John the Baptist was martyred.
   12. Peter made his great confession, proclaiming that Christ was truly
       the Messiah, and the Son of God.
   13. Christ was Transfigured with heavenly glory to strengthen the faith
       of the disciples.
   14. He gave many parables.
   15. Raised Lazarus from the dead.
   16. On the Sunday before He was crucified on Friday, He made His
       triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
   17. He cleansed the Temple the second time.
   18. On Thursday, the day before His crucifixion, He instituted the
       Lord's Supper.

   3. HIS DEATH, RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION--
    1. On Friday, April 7th, 30 A. D., at 9 a. m., Christ was crucified,
       as the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world.
    2. Early Sunday morning He rose again from the dead for our
       justification, a proof and assurance of the believer's
       resurrection.
    3. During 40 days He appeared on ten different occasions to the
       disciples.
    4. He gave the Great Commission to the 500 disciples on the Mount.
    5. In the presence of the eleven disciples He ascended into Heaven,
       having promised to come again in like manner.

   LESSONS--
    1. We should believe with Peter and John that Christ was God come in
       the flesh to die for the sins of the world, and to provide us with
       an everlasting salvation.
    2. He should be our example in humility and service. When we think of
       how He obeyed His inferiors, how He laid aside ever thought of ease
       and underwent every hardship, how He sacrificed friendships and
       family joys for the sake of us and our salvation, we should, with
       the sublimest devotion, be willing to follow in His steps, 1 Peter
       2:21.

  Great Fact II The Events of Peter's Period 30-48 A. D.

   For 18 years the church at Jerusalem, with James as its pastor, and
   Peter as the leading apostle, directed the spread of the gospel.
    1. MATTHIAS was elected to succeed Judas as an apostle.
    2. PENTECOST--Ten days after Christ's ascension, on the Day of the
       Pentecost, the apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit, and able
       to preach in various languages with the result that 3,000 were
       converted.
    3. ANANIAS and SAPPHIRA sought to deceive God and the apostles and
       were punished with instant death.
    4. FIRST DEACONS--Seven deacons were chosen to look after the
       financial affairs of the church.
    5. STEPHEN,--who earnestly preached the true Faith, was stoned to
       death on the charge of speaking blasphemy words against the Temple
       and the Law.
    6. PAUL'S CONVERSION--The bitter but brilliant Saul was converted, and
       became Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles.
    7. CONVERSION OF CORNELIUS--Cornelius, who was a commander of 100
       Roman soldiers, became interested in the gospel and sent for Peter,
       who preached to him and the Gentiles who were in his house, with
       the result that they were converted and filled with the Spirit.
       This established the fact that Gentiles should receive the same
       blessings, and have the same standing in the churches, on the same
       conditions as the Jews.
    8. ANTIOCH--The gospel was now preached at Antioch for a year, by
       Barnabas and Paul with great success, and it was here that the
       disciples were first called Christians.

  Great Fact III. The Events of Paul's Period 48-68 A. D.

    1. The church at Antioch sent forth Paul and Barnabas for the FIRST
       MISSIONARY JOURNEY, and they preached in fourteen cities in Asia
       Minor for two years.
    2. Paul and Barnabas attended the CHURCH COUNCIL at Jerusalem where it
       was re-affirmed that the Gentiles need not be circumcised, nor have
       to keep the Law of Moses, but are saved by grace alone.
    3. Paul and Silas, in the SECOND MISSIONARY JOURNEY, revisited some of
       the towns of Asia Minor, and then took the gospel to Europe for the
       first time. The first city they preached in was Phillipi and the
       first convert was Lydia. This journey occupied three years.
    4. Paul and Timothy in the THIRD MISSIONARY JOURNEY revisited the
       churches in Asia Minor, staying about three years at Ephesus, and
       returning this time to Jerusalem.
    5. While on these missionary journeys, Paul WROTE SIX EPISTLES:
       Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
    6. PAUL'S CLOSING MINISTRY--Jews of Asia brought about Paul's arrest
       on the charge of profaning the Temple. He was kept in prison in
       Caesarea for two years, and for two years more at Rome, where he
       preached to all with whom he came in contact, and wrote the four
       Prison Epistles of Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians, and
       Philippians. He was freed for two years, during which time he wrote
       the Pastoral Epistles of First Timothy and Titus, but being
       arrested again, he wrote Second Timothy just before he was beheaded
       in 68 A. D., and received the crown of righteousness.

  Great Fact IV. The Other Apostles. 30-100 A. D.

    1. JAMES, the brother of John, was put to death with the sword by King
       Agrippa, in 44 A. D.
    2. JAMES, THE BROTHER OF OUR LORD, who also wrote the epistle that
       bears his name, did a great work in leading many Jews to accept
       Christ as the Messiah, which so enraged the Sanhedrin that they
       stoned him to death.
    3. THOMAS preached the gospel in Persia, and likely in India.
    4. ANDREW laboured in South Russia, and is said to have been crucified
       on a cross formed like the letter X, hence called St. Andrew's
       Cross.
    5. PHILLIP preached in Phrygia, which was in central Asia Minor.
    6. BARTHOLOMEW laboured in Arabia, and likely in Armenia.
    7. MATTHEW is said to have laboured in Egypt, Asia and Europe.
    8. SIMON, not Peter, but another of the Twelve, is supposed to have
       spent his missionary life in Egypt, Cyrene and Great Britain.
    9. JOHN, after the death of Peter and Paul, became the leader among
       the Christians. He was pastor for a long time of the church at
       Ephesus, and won many to the Lord Jesus. When the emperor, Domitian
       of Rome. persecuted the Christians.

   John was banished to the island of Patmos where he received the
   wonderful visions recorded in the book of Revelation, and wrote the
   seven short letters to the churches in Asia. It is said that when John
   was too old and weak to preach, he would be carried into the church,
   and holding forth his hands would say, "Little children, let us love
   one another!"

   THE CLOSE OF SACRED HISTORY Christ lived and died to make the gospel
   possible and to found His church. The apostles were inspired to preach
   the gospel all over the known world, and in the scriptures that they
   left to reveal the gospel in all its fullness, with its doctrines and
   church ordinances. Henceforward, until the Son of Man shall come in His
   glory, there will be no authoritative religious teaching for man,
   except as it shall come from the Holy Scriptures and be made plain by
   the Holy Spirit! "Unto Him who loved us, and freed us from our sins by
   His own blood, and made us kings with free access to God, His Father,
   to Him be glory and power to the end of the ages! AMEN."
