  Introduction

   Our modern world is decidedly confused. On the one hand, the
   rationalistic, humanistic viewpoint dominates within our public
   education system. We are now taught to question the validity of
   anything that can be called "supernatural." The very idea that someone
   might believe in miracles, revelation, etc., is opened up to direct
   ridicule. At the same time, in a direct reaction against this kind of
   dry humanism, many people are fleeing for refuge into every kind of
   spiritistic group imaginable. "Channeling" (a fancy way of saying a
   spirit medium) is very popular, and the Eastern ideas of reincarnation
   and mysticism are drawing converts from every walk of life.

   In the midst of all of this confusion we find the Bible, continuing to
   proclaim the timeless message of Jesus Christ. Yet even the Lord Jesus
   has come in for modern "updating" in many men's writings. After a
   century of "searching for the historical Jesus" men (hopefully) have
   discovered that outside of the inspired writings of the apostles in the
   New Testament, we will not find much information on who Jesus was.
   Indeed, unless we see that it is illogical and irrational to reject the
   Scriptures for what they claim to be [1] we will never have much to say
   to our world.

   Today it is normal for "Christian" theologians to de-emphasize the
   doctrinal aspects of the Person of Jesus Christ. Since rationalism and
   naturalism are the modes of the day, it is unpopular to deal with the
   clear Biblical teaching of the deity of the Lord Jesus and his
   pre-existence. The person who looks to the Bible, however, has little
   choice in the matter - the doctrine is clearly stated both in the
   Gospels as well as the epistles, and indeed it is implicit in most of
   the New Testament.

   One cannot easily disassociate the doctrine of the pre-existence of
   Christ from that of his deity, as they are part and parcel of the same
   teaching. An in-depth discussion of the deity of Christ is outside of
   the realm of this paper, and it will be assumed that an understanding
   of the main elements of this doctrine are shared with the reader. [2]

   This discussion will be limited to the focal passages found in the New
   Testament that deal with the pre-existence of the Lord Jesus. For our
   purposes these are as follows: John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:15-17, and
   Philippians 2:5-7. Each of these passages have much in common, as we
   shall see in our examination of them, both in an exegetical
   understanding, as well as in patristic interpretation. It will be
   relevant to a discussion of the early Church's views to discuss the
   order of writing of the books which contain our primary data on the
   pre-existence of Christ. Generally, the Pauline epistles are dated
   anywhere from the late 40's to the late 60's of the first century. The
   majority of scholarship sees Paul's writings preceding John's by quite
   some time, and there is general agreement concerning the order of
   Paul's letters and their place in history. [3] The question of the
   exact date of John's gospel, however, is not so easily resolved. Merril
   C. Tenney [4] notes that modern estimates range from 45 to beyond 100
   A.D. Part of the problem can be found in the fact that during what
   might be called the "hyper-critical" period of the last century, it
   became quite popular to deny the Johanine authorship of the Gospel of
   John, and, due to its high Christology (which the rationalists assumed
   had to be a mythological invention of the early Church) place it at
   least into the second century. Modern textual finds (such as the famous
   P[75]) have demolished any ideas of a second-century date for John, and
   today the dates normally fall between A.D. 85 and 95. [5] What is very
   important to notice about the fact of the early (i.e., non-second
   century dating) is that the Christology of John is, therefore, no
   different than that of the early Church as the book was written during
   the same time period! Indeed, there is no way for there to have been
   sufficient time for such "myths" to have evolved, and, it is not
   logical to think that John would have written about certain events that
   could be proven false by living witnesses! With these facts in mind, we
   can move on to the actual exegesis of these passages.

   [1] 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 2 Peter 1:20-21.

   [2] This writer sees the following passages as directly ascribing to
   Jesus Christ the term God: Isaiah 9:6 (Hebrew: Elohim) John 1:1 (Greek:
   theos), 1:18, 20:28, Acts 20:28 (depending on text), Romans 9:5, Titus
   2:13, Hebrews 1:8, 2 Peter 1:1 and (possibly) 1 John 5:20.
   Interestingly, in reference to Titus 2:13 (and 2 Peter 1:1 - both
   similar syntactical constructions) Chrysostom ("Homily IV on
   Philippians in The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers volume 13, pg. 207)
   clearly understood the implications of the syntax of Titus 2:13, and
   bases part of his polemic against the Arians on the application of
   theos to Christ. See also A. T. Robertson, The Minister and His Greek
   New Testament (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1977), pgs. 61-68.

   [3] F. F. Bruce Paul Apostle of the Heart Set Free (Grand Rapids: Wm.
   B. Eerdman's Publishing Company, 1977) p. 475) places the epistles of
   Paul in the following order: Galatians, 1 & 2 Thessalonians, 1 & 2
   Corinthians, Romans, Philippians, Colossians, Ephesians, Philemon, 1 &
   2 Timothy, Titus with Galatians at 48 A.D., Colossians and Philippians
   in 60-62 A.D., and Paul's death in approximately 65 A.D. This is almost
   identical to A. T. Robertson's ("Paul the Apostle" in The International
   Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdman's Publishing
   Company, 1956) vol. 3:2265-2266) order of writing, with the exception
   of Galatians, which Robertson places just before Romans. See also Ralph
   Martin, "Colossians and Philemon" in The New Century Bible Commentary,
   (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdman's Publishing Company, 1983) pg. 30 on the
   dating of Colossians.

   [5] Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church , (Grand Rapids: Wm
   B. Eerdman's Publishing Company, 1985) vol. 1:721-724 gives a good
   argument for Johanine authorship, and dates it before 100 A.D. A. T.
   Robertson, Word Pictures in the New Testament, (Grand Rapids: Baker
   Book House, 1932) vol. 5:1 dates John at A.D. 90. James Iverach, "John
   the Apostle" in The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, (Grand
   Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdman's Publishing Company, 1956) vol. 3:1721-1722
   also dates John at end of first century.

  Exegesis of Principal Passages

   The Prologue of John (1:1-18) is unique in Biblical literature. It is
   clear that the main point of John is not the person of God. His
   emphasis is the identity of the Word. The Logos is the central figure
   of the work, and the teaching of the passage is that the Logos is
   intricately involved with the creation of the universe. The
   pre-existence of the Logos is clearly stated and assumed throughout the
   prologue.

   Much has been said concerning the origin of the term logos. Philo [6]
   used the term, yet the logos of Philo is simply an impersonal
   manifestation of the Wisdom of God. John's usage of the term may indeed
   borrow from Philo (especially if John wrote the Gospel while in
   Ephesus, as the Greeks would be able to understand the term), but he
   goes far beyond anything Philo dreamed of. Rather than a pantheistic,
   impersonal divine emanation, the Logos of John is a personal, eternal
   being who is not simply a part of creation, but is rather the Creator
   himself. The first verse itself must be examined to be understood.
   Transliterated into Greek the verse reads: En arche en ho logos, kai ho
   logos en pros ton theon, kai theos en ho logos. The verse breaks down
   into three clauses, each being vital to the whole. The first thing to
   notice is the fact that the imperfect form of eimi is used throughout
   the prologue in reference to the Logos. This tense, attached to the
   phrase "en arche" is timeless - i.e, as far back as one wishes to push
   the "beginning" the Word is already in existence. This is seen, for
   example, in the translation of the New English Bible which renders it,
   "When all things began, the Word already was." Today's English Version
   puts it, "Before the world was created, the Word already existed..."
   Hence, the first phrase clearly presents the eternality of the Word and
   hence his pre-existence.

   The second phrase presents the inter-personal relationship of the Logos
   and God. The Greek phrase pros, translated "with," refers to the
   existence of communication and fellowship between the Logos and theos.
   [7] The word was used to describe being "face to face" with another.
   Now, unless John had added the final phrase ("and the Word was God")
   there would have been a problem here, as the first phrase clearly
   presents the Logos as eternal, while the second demonstrates his
   distinct personality. This would create polytheism without the final
   phrase's emendation. At the same time, this second clause ends any
   chance of Sabellianism's success.

   The final phrase, kai theos en ho logos, presents a syntactical
   arrangement in which the term theos is emphasized. At the same time,
   the sentence is copulative, and the presence of the article with logos
   simply sets it out as the subject of the sentence. Much has been said
   concerning the lack of the article with theos [8] but that discussion
   is beyond the scope of this paper. Basically, the construction 1)
   avoids modalism (i.e., the Word is not said to be completely
   co-extensive with theos) and 2) teaches that the Word has the same
   nature as God (a point that Paul will reiterate in Philippians). Verse
   3 links the eternality of the Word with creatorship. "Through him all
   things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."
   John here is intent on separating the Logos from the realm of the
   created - he started in the very first phrase by asserting his timeless
   existence and continues here by attributing to the Logos all of
   creation, an item that will reappear in Colossians. The only possible
   way to interpret these verses is to see the Logos as an eternal being
   who created all things.

   The prologue continues by identifying the Logos with the person of
   Jesus Christ in 1:14. It is interesting to note that John very
   carefully differentiates between the Word in his absolute nature and
   all other things. When the eternal Word is in view, John uses en. When
   created things are being discussed (such as John in 1:6), the aorist
   egeneto is found. However, when we come to the time event of 1:14
   (i.e., the incarnation), John switches from the timeless en to the
   aorist egeneto - the Word became flesh at a point in time in history.
   Finally, in 1:18, [9] John seals the case by calling Jesus the
   "only-begotten God," or, more accurately, the "unique God" [10] who
   reveals the Father, who "exegetes" [11] God to man. These verses with
   which John begins his gospel are meant, in my opinion, to form an
   "interpretive window" through which the reader is meant to look at the
   words that follow. One must constantly keep the Logos in the back of
   the mind when interpreting the words and actions of Jesus. [12] Much of
   what Christ says must be understood in this light to even make much
   sense! His unique relationship with the Father is intelligible only in
   the light of his eternal pre-existence with him. Equally significant
   are Jesus' own "I am" sayings found in John 8:24, 8:58, 13:19 and
   18:5-6. Though there is some discussion concerning the use of the
   phrase ego eimi in this absolute sense, [13] these passages clearly
   show an intentional aspect to Christ's words relevant to his identity.
   In both 8:58 and 18:5-6, John takes pains to make sure the reader
   understands the impact of Christ's words on his hearers. In 13:19 we
   find an extremely close parallel to the LXX rendering of Isaiah 43:10,
   here applied to Christ by himself. One can hardly escape the
   significance of the Hebrew term ani hu as used by Isaiah, and its Greek
   translation as ego eimi. Since Christ purposefully utilized these
   phrases of himself, it is safe to say that he was claiming for himself
   the title of the "I Am" - the eternal one, YHWH. The other two texts
   fall outside of the realm of the Gospels, though they must reflect very
   early teaching of the Church, and therefore are just as important as
   the Johanine passages in determining the Scriptural basis of the
   doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ. Both Pauline passages are
   vital, and both come from very different contexts. The first to be
   examined (Colossians 1:15-17) comes from a book that seems to contain
   within it a polemic against gnosticism (or, possibly,
   "proto-gnosticism"), while the second (Philippians 2:5-7) comes from a
   book that is conspicuous for its lack of polemic. Colossians 1:15-17 is
   considered by some to be an early Christian hymn. [14] Its structure
   most definitely resembles the poetic style of a song, and one can find
   it easy to see how Paul would utilize song to teach doctrine in the
   churches. The principal verses relevant to our discussion of
   pre-existence form the first half of this passage - the second
   discusses the pre-eminence of Christ in redemption and in the Church.

   In vs. 15 the pre-existent Christ is styled the "eikon tou theou tou
   aoratou" - the express image of the invisible God. One can easily see
   the parallel between this and John's description of Christ as the
   unique God who "exegetes" the Father (1:18). In Christ the invisible
   God became visible to man. Attendant to this, Paul describes Christ as
   the prototokos - the firstborn. [15] The main meaning of "firstborn" is
   the one who has pre-eminence, and indeed, the Hebrew term which
   prototokos translates in the LXX (bekhor) is not connected with either
   the ideas of protos or tokos. [16] Hence, the pre-eminence of Christ is
   the point of prototokos, and, as the following verses will make very
   clear, there is no temporal idea of generation or creation found in
   this passage relevant to Christ.

   Verses 16 and 17 exhaust the Greek mind in their rush to include all of
   creation in the realm of the power of Christ. Nothing is left out by
   Paul at this point. His use of the phrase ta panta is absolute, and to
   make sure that everyone realizes this, he lists the elements that make
   up the panta. J. B. Lightfoot [17] well comments:

   "All the laws and purposes which guide the creation and government of
   the Universe reside in Him, the Eternal Word, as their meeting-point.
   The Apostolic doctrine of the Logos teaches us to regard the Eternal
   Word as holding the same relation to the Universe which the Incarnate
   Christ holds to the Church. He is the source of its life, the centre of
   all its developments, the mainspring of all its motions...The
   Judeo-Alexandrian teachers represented the Logos, which in their view
   was nothing more than the Divine mind energizing, as the topos where
   the eternal ideas...have their abode...The Apostolic teaching is an
   enlargement of this conception, inasmuch as the Logos is no longer a
   philosophical abstraction but a Divine Person..."

   In this divine person all things "hold together" or consist. This
   divine person is said to be "before ta panta - all things." There is no
   clearer passage in the Bible concerning the fact that Jesus Christ, the
   eternal Word, created all things. There is no room here for the gnostic
   pleroma in which Christ is but a part - no, here Christ is seen as the
   Creator Himself who holds the universe together by his own power. The
   pre- existent Christ shines brightly in Paul's mind, and forms the
   basis for his teaching of the relationship between Christ and the
   Church. Note also the harmony between Paul and John on this point. [18]
   The third passage to be examined comes from Paul's letter to the church
   at Philippi. It, too, is hymnic in structure, and is set off as such by
   the New International Version. The major section comprises what is
   actually a sermon illustration of Paul's in reference to his admonition
   to the Philippians to act in humility of mind toward one another. To
   support this point, Paul points to the person of Jesus Christ as the
   ultimate example of this attitude. Indeed, it is vital to understand
   the immediately preceding context when some phrases within the passage
   are encountered, as we shall see. The first phrase of verse 6 sets the
   tone for the theological discussion to follow. Paul says that Christ
   was "existing" (huparchon) in the "form of God" (morphe tou theou).
   What does this mean? The participle huparchon is again "timeless" in
   that it does not point to any moment when Jesus "started" to exist in
   the form of God - Christ has always been in the form of God. And what
   is the morphe? It is that quality or characteristic which makes
   something what it is rather than what it is not. God is known by his
   morphe, and no other being has his form. The NIV picks this up by
   translating the phrase, "who being in very nature God..."

   Paul is here looking back before the incarnation to the pre-existent
   state of the Lord, and says that in that state the Lord Jesus shared
   with the Father the form of God. Not only this, but he goes on to say
   that the Lord had "equality with God" and yet did not regard that
   equality something to be "grasped." Much has been written on just how
   to take the term harpagmon. [19] After plowing through a large portion
   of the material representing various views, the interpretation given by
   Chrysostom [20] and followed by Lightfoot [21] seems to be the only
   logical outcome and is the one that best fits the context of the
   passage. Basically, this view sees the word harpagmon referring to the
   fact that Christ, though already equal with the Father, did not regard
   that equality something to be held on to at all cost, but, as the
   ultimate example of humility, laid his privileges aside for our sakes
   and "made himself nothing." This fits the context of the passage, that
   of walking in "humility of mind" for how can it be an example of
   humility for Christ to not desire equality with God if he did not
   already have it? Not trying to become equal with God is not humility -
   it is simply not committing blasphemy. [22]

   We have now seen three passages that clearly present the Lord Jesus as
   having had a personal, distinct existence before his incarnation and
   earthly life. This existence is seen to be personal, and to be
   connected with distinctive acts such as creation and intimate
   fellowship with the Father. His pre-incarnation life is also seen to
   have been eternal, and not temporal as that of a creation. Given this
   fact, how did the early Christian Fathers view this doctrine? To this
   we now turn.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Patristic Interpretation

   As we have seen, the doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ is
   explicitly stated in the New Testament documents, and is implicit in
   much of the story of Jesus as well as the teaching of the Church about
   his person. J.N.D. Kelly [23] notes this, and given all of this data,
   it seems incredible that anyone today could still maintain that the
   doctrine is based on the reflection of the Church. Such "mythologizing"
   takes more time than the documents now allow.

   The Apostolic Fathers do not give us a great deal of information on
   Christology proper. Hence, the information to be found on this
   particular aspect of the doctrine of Christ will also be scant. There
   are still, however, some interesting facts. Ignatius gives us one of
   the most eloquent statements concerning the early Church's view of
   Christ in his letter to the Ephesians, 7:2:

   "There is one only physician, of flesh and of spirit, generate and
   ingenerate (gennetos kai agennetos) God in man (en anthropo theos),
   true Life in death, Son of Mary and Son of God, first passible and then
   impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord."

   The duality of the Lord's nature (God/man) is clearly seen in Ignatius,
   and is repeated in his letter to Polycarp, 3:2:

   "Await Him that is above every season, the Eternal, the Invisible, who
   became visible for our sake, the Impalpable, the Impassible, who
   suffered for our sake, who endured in all ways for our sake."

   Pre-existence is not just implied but clearly stated in this passage,
   attributing to Christ eternality, and seeing the incarnation as the
   point in time at which God broke into human history for the sake of
   man. It is significant that Ignatius calls Jesus Christ "God" 14 times
   in his letters.

   Discussion of John 1, Colossians 1 and Philippians 2 was fairly limited
   in the early Fathers' writings, most probably due to the fact that the
   Arian controversy was still future, and the church's main enemy at that
   time was gnosticism and docetism, neither of which would require a
   strong statement of the pre-existence of Christ, at least by itself.
   Paul is attacking gnostic ideas in Colossians, but even the gnostics
   believed in some kind of pre-existence for Christ. Irenaeus exegeted
   John 1:1 against the gnostics in Book V of Against Heresies, chapter
   18, [24] and did as Paul did and pointed out that Jesus is the Creator
   not a part of the creation.

   The introduction of Arianism drew the attention of the Church back to
   the Person of Christ and his relationship with the Father. Origen's
   synthesis of Greek philosophy and its idea of the Divine Wisdom with
   Christian doctrine had laid the groundwork for Arius' denial of the
   absolute deity of Christ and, thereby, the denial of the eternal pre-
   existence of the Lord Jesus. John's filling of the eternal Logos with
   personality was reversed somewhat, and the timeless en of John 1:1
   seemingly was lost in the shuffle.

   It is no surprise, then, that the Church Fathers after Nicea spend much
   more time on John 1:1, Colossians 1:15-17, and Philippians 2:5-7. The
   Nicene Creed had clearly stated the Deity of Christ as well as his
   pre-existence. [25] The six decades that followed saw a resurgence of
   Arianism and, after great struggle, the victory of the Nicene faith.
   During that time the great Athanasius wrote volumes in defense of the
   deity of the Son. Chalcedon reaffirmed Nicea and went farther in
   attempting to answer the questions concerning the relationship of the
   divine and the human in Christ. [26]

   The body of writing of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is large
   indeed. The series edited by Schaff takes up 28 large volumes alone.
   Hence, to overview all of this literature would be far beyond the scope
   of this paper. Therefore, the three main exegetes of the century after
   Nicea - Chrysostom, Athanasius, and Augustine - will be examined,
   briefly, to determine how they understood the focal passages listed
   above.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Chrysostom:

   Of the three Fathers I have chosen to look at, Chrysostom (345- 407)
   expressed the clearest if not the most in-depth understanding of the
   doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ. Chrysostom was called the
   "golden-mouthed," and this passage [27] on John 1:1 should explain why:

   "For the intellect, having ascended to `the beginning,' enquires what
   `beginning': and then finding the `was' always outstripping its
   imagination, has no point at which to stay its thought; but looking
   intently onwards, and being unable to cease at any point, it becomes
   wearied out, and turns back to things below. For this, `was in the
   beginning,' is nothing else than expressive of ever being and being
   infinitely."

   Chrysostom's point is the same as made previously on the basis of the
   imperfect en in 1:1 - it is timeless. A little later he adds, "...(the)
   first `was,' applied to `the Word,' is only indicative of His eternal
   Being..." In the same manner, he keys on the term pros as well, saying
   "For he does not say, was `in God,' but was `with God': declaring to us
   His eternity as to person. Then, as he advances, he has more clearly
   revealed it, by adding, that this `Word' also `was God.'" [28] The
   eternality of the Word was one of Chrysostom's main ideas in his
   exegesis of John 1, and he repeatedly stressed the concept. [29]

   Nor did Colossians 1:15-17 escape Chrysostom's notice. Keying on verses
   16-17, he attacked the gnostic concept of the creation and its duality
   by pressing the list of things created by Christ, claiming that
   obviously Paul was including all of creation under the Son's reign.

   "...the subsistence of all things depends on Him. Not only did He
   Himself bring them out of nothing into being, but Himself sustains them
   now, so that were they dissevered from His Providence, they were at
   once undone and destroyed." [30]

   Most importantly, Chrysostom contributed greatly to the understanding
   of Philippians 2:5-11. He wrote:

   "What does Paul wish to establish by this example? Surely, to lead the
   Philippians to humility. To what purpose then did he bring forward this
   example? For no one who would exhort to humility speaks thus; `Be thou
   humble, and think less of thyself than of thine equals in honor, for
   such an one who is a slave has not risen against his master; do thou
   imitate him.' This, any one would say, is not humility, but
   arrogance!...If he were exhorting servants to obey the free, to what
   purpose could he bring forward the subjection of a servant to a master?
   of a lesser to a greater?" [31]

   The point has already been made (in the exegesis section) that the
   understanding of Paul's exhortation to humility is, in this writer's
   opinion, the key to understanding the passage, and here Chrysostom
   makes this point quite well.

  Athanasius:

   Rightly called the great defender of the Nicene faith, Athanasius
   possessed a keen insight into the central doctrines of Christianity.
   Like Augustine after him, Athanasius saw Philippians 2:5-7 in close
   connection with John 1:1. In his "Four Discourses Against the Arians",
   Discourse II, [32] he ties John 1:1, 14 together with Philippians 2:6
   as his main Scriptural support of the deity of Christ. To Athanasius,
   John's eternal Word existing "with" God and being God is the same as
   Paul's pre-existent Christ eternally existing in God's form and being
   equal with him.

   Similarly, Athanasius quotes all of the Carmen Christi and then says,
   "Can anything be plainer than this? He was not from a lower state
   promoted; but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a servant,
   and in taking it, was not promoted but humbled Himself." [33] This view
   of the eternally existing Christ is found also in his "Statement of
   Faith" [34] in which he says,

   "All things to wit were made through the Son; but He Himself is not a
   creature, as Paul says of the Lord: `In Him were all things created,
   and He is before All' (Col. 1:16). Now He says not, `was created'
   before all things, but `is' before all things. To be created, namely,
   is applicable to all things, but `is before all' applies to the Son
   only."

   One final quote from Athanasius should be sufficient to represent his
   interpretation of this doctrine:

   "Therefore if the Word be creature, He would not be first or beginning
   of the rest; yet if He be before all, as indeed He is, and is Himself
   alone First and Son, it does not follow that He is beginning of all
   things as to His Essence, for what is the beginning of all is in the
   number of all. And if He is not such a beginning, then neither is He a
   creature, but it is very plain that He differs in essence and nature
   from the creatures, and is other than they, and is Likeness and Image
   of the sole and true God, being Himself sole also. Hence He is not
   classed with creatures in Scripture..." [35]

  Augustine:

   Augustine wrote a great deal on John 1:1 and Philippians 2:5-7, but
   very little on Colossians 1:15-17. Quite frequently the two passages
   are quoted together. Augustine's "Homilies on the Gospel of John"
   provides plenty of information on his views of the pre-existence of
   Christ as revealed in John 1. [36] However, we will look more at the
   doctrinal sections of Augustine's writings. In his "Enchiridion" he
   wrote: [37]

   "Wherefore Christ Jesus, the Son of God, is both God and man; God
   before all worlds; man in our world: God, because the Word of God
   (for`the Word was God'); and man, because in His one person the Word
   was joined with a body and a rational soul. Wherefore, so far as He is
   God, He and the Father are one; so far as He is man, the Father is
   greater than He. For when He was the only Son of God, not by grace, but
   by nature, that He might be full of grace, He became the Son of man;
   and He Himself unites both natures in His own identity, and both
   natures constitute on Christ; because, `being in the form of God, He
   thought it not robbery to be,' what He was by nature, `equal with God.'
   But He made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Himself the form of
   a servant, not losing or lessening the form of God. And, accordingly,
   He was both made less and remained equal, being both in one, as has
   been said: but He was one of these as Word, and the other as man. As
   Word, He is equal with the Father; as man, less than the Father. One
   Son of God, and at the same time Son of man; one Son of man, and at the
   same time Son of God; not two Sons of God, God and man, but one Son of
   God; God without beginning; man with a beginning, our Lord Jesus
   Christ."

   This passage is one of many [38] that could be cited, but it admirably
   sums up Augustine's view-point for our purposes.

   A Modern Viewpoint: The Westminster Confession The Westminster
   Confession is hailed by many as the greatest theological creed since
   the Reformation era, and so it is. A lengthy discussion need not be put
   forth to demonsrate the harmony between Westminster and the Scriptures,
   creeds, and Fathers already cited. The Confession itself, Chapter VIII
   "Of Christ the Mediator," sections I-III should be sufficient to
   demonstrate the acceptance of the doctrine:

   "I. It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the
   Lord Jesus, his only-begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and
   man, the Prophet, Priest, and King; the Head and Saviour of his Church,
   the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world; unto whom he did, from
   all eternity, give a people to be his seed, and to be by him in time
   redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified. "II. The Son of
   God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of
   one substance, and equal with the Father, did, when the fullness of
   time was come, take upon him man's nature, with all the essential
   properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin: being
   conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin
   Mary, of her substance. So that two whole, perfect, and distinct
   natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together
   in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion. Which
   person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only mediator
   between God and man. III. The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus
   united to the divine, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy Spirit
   above measure; having in him all the treasure of wisdom and knowledge,
   in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell;..." [39]

   The greatest of the Protestant creeds clearly bases its high view of
   the Lord Jesus Christ on the fact of the Scriptural revelation of his
   eternal pre-existence with the Father, in the very form of God. This
   writer sees any movement away from the clear stance of Westminster
   (reflecting Biblical teaching) as a move away from truth.

  Conclusion

   We have seen above that the New Testament writers John and Paul both
   clearly presented the fact of the pre-existence of the Lord Jesus
   Christ. Not only did Christ exist before his birth in Bethlehem, but he
   existed eternally pros ton theon (with God) and in the very nature of
   God (morphe tou theou). These are high words and concepts, to be sure;
   but no less true. We have seen that the early church fathers understood
   this concept (Ignatius) and made it a part of their teaching. The
   council of Nicea reaffirmed the faith of the Apostles, and the great
   Church fathers Chrysostom, Athanasius and Augustine were in harmony
   with those who came before. Finally, we saw that the great creed of the
   Protestant faith, Westminster, continues the millenia-old understanding
   of Christians everywhere that the Lord of Glory, Jesus Christ, has
   eternally been God.
