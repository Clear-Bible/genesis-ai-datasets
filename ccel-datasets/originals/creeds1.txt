PREFACE
     __________________________________________________________________


   A 'symbolical library' that contains the creeds and confessions of all
   Christian denominations fills a vacuum in theological and historical
   literature. It is surprising that it has not been supplied long ago.
   Sectarian exclusiveness or doctrinal indifferentism may have prevented
   it. Other symbolical collections are confined to particular
   denominations and periods. In this work the reader will find the
   authentic material for the study of Comparative Theology Symbolics,
   Polemics, and Irenics. In a country like ours, where people of all
   creeds meet in daily contact, this study ought to command more
   attention than it has hitherto received.

   The First Volume has expanded into a doctrinal history of the Church,
   so far as it is embodied in public standards of faith. The most
   important and fully developed symbolical systems the Vatican Romanism,
   the Lutheranism of the Formula of Concord, and the Calvinism of the
   Westminster standards have been subjected to a critical analysis. The
   author has endeavored to combine the aletheuein en agape and the agapan
   en aletheia, and to be mindful of the golden motto, In necessariis
   unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas. Honest and earnest
   controversy, conducted in a Christian and catholic spirit, promotes
   true and lasting union. Polemics looks to Irenics--the aim of war is
   peace.

   The Second Volume contains the Scripture Confessions, the ante-Nicene
   Rules of Faith, the cumenical, the Greek, and the Latin Creeds, from
   the Confession of Peter down to the Vatican Decrees. It includes also
   the best Russian Catechism and the recent Old Catholic Union
   Propositions of the Bonn Conferences.

   The Third Volume is devoted to the Lutheran, Anglican, Calvinistic, and
   the later Protestant Confessions of Faith. The documents of the Third
   Part (pp. 707-876) have never been collected before.

   The creeds and confessions are given in the original languages from the
   best editions, and are accompanied by translations for the convenience
   of the English reader. [1]

   While these volumes were passing through the press several learned
   treatises on the ancient creeds by Lumby, Swainson, Hort, Caspari, and
   others have appeared, though not too late to be noticed in the final
   revision. The literature has been brought down to the close of 1876. I
   trust that nothing of importance has escaped my attention.

   I take pleasure in acknowledging my obligation to several distinguished
   divines, in America and England, for valuable information concerning
   the denominations to which they belong, and for several contributions,
   which appear under the writers' names. [2] In a history of conflicting
   creeds it is wise to consult representative men as well as books, in
   order to secure strict accuracy and impartiality, which are the
   cardinal virtues of a historian.

   May this repository of creeds and confessions promote a better
   understanding among the Churches of Christ. The divisions of
   Christendom bring to light the various aspects and phases of revealed
   truth, and will be overruled at last for a deeper and richer harmony,
   of which Christ is the key-note. In him and by him all problems of
   theology and history will be solved. The nearer believers of different
   creeds approach the Christological centre, the better they will
   understand and love each other.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

   --------------

   The call for a new edition of this work in less than a year after its
   publication is an agreeable surprise to the author, and fills him with
   gratitude to the reading public and the many reviewers, known and
   unknown, who have so kindly and favorably noticed it in American and
   foreign periodicals and in private letters. One of the foremost divines
   of Germany (Dr. Dorner, in the Jahrbüher für Deutsche Theologie, 1877,
   p. 682) expresses a surprise that the idea of such an oecumenical
   collection of Christian Creeds should have originated in America, where
   the Church is divided into so many rival denominations; but he adds
   also as an explanation that this division creates a desire for unity
   and co-operation, and a mutual courtesy and kindness unknown among the
   contending parties and schools under the same roof of state-churches,
   where outward uniformity is maintained at the expense of inward peace
   and harmony.

   The changes in this edition are very few. The literature in the first
   volume is brought down to the present date, and at the close of the
   second volume a fac-simile of the oldest MSS. of the Athanasian Creed
   and the Apostles' Creed is added.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

   --------------


   This edition differs from the second in the following particulars:

   1. In the first volume several errors have been corrected (e.g., in the
   statistical table, p. 818), and a list of new works inserted on p. xiv.

   2. In the third volume a translation of the Second Helvetic Confession
   has been added, pp. 831 sqq.

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

   --------------

   The call for a fourth edition of this work has made it my duty to give
   the first volume once more a thorough revision and to bring the
   literature down to the latest date. In this I have been aided by my
   young friend, the Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, one of the assistant editors
   of my "Religious Encyclopædia." The additions which could not be
   conveniently made in the plates have been printed separately after the
   Table of Contents, pp. xiv-xvii.

   The second and third volumes, which embrace the symbolical documents,
   remain unchanged, except that at the end of the third volume the new
   Congregational Creed of 1883 has been added.

   Creeds will live as long as faith survives, with the duty to confess
   our faith before men. By and by we shall reach, through the Creeds of
   Christendom, the one comprehensive, harmonious Creed of Christ.


   P. S.

   New York, May, 1884.


   ----------------------------


   The fifth edition was a reprint of the fourth, without any changes.

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION.

   --------------

   Since the appearance of the Creeds of Christendom, 1877, no work has
   been issued competing with it in scope and comprehensiveness. The
   valuable collection of W. W. Walker, The Creeds and Platforms of
   Congregationalism, 1893, and W. J. McGlothlin, Baptist Confessions of
   Faith, 1911, are limited to separate Protestant bodies. The extensive
   collection of Karl Müller, 1903, is confined to the creeds and
   catechisms of the Reformed Churches. Professor W. A. Curtis of the
   University of Edinburgh, in his History of the Creeds and Confessions
   of Faith in Christendom and Beyond, gives the contents of creeds and an
   account of their origins, not their texts. C. Fabricius, in his Corpus
   confessionum, etc., 1928, sqq., proposes in connexion with colaborers
   to furnish not only the texts of the Christian creeds, but also the
   texts of hymns, liturgies, books of discipline, and other documents
   bearing on Christian doctrine, worship, and practice. For example, 250
   pages of Volume I are devoted to hymns, and 250 pages to "The Doctrines
   and Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church, 1924."

   The new material of the present edition is the following:

   Volume I. Additions to the literature; notices of the Church of the
   Disciples and the Universalist and Unitarian Churches; and changes and
   additions, as, for example, on the primitive creeds and the Russian
   Church.

   Volume II. In the fourth edition Dr. Schaff, in view of the new
   importance given in Canon Law to papal utterances on doctrine and
   morals, added one of the important encyclicals of Leo XIII., who was
   then living. To this encyclical have been added bulls on the Church, by
   Boniface VIII., 1302, Anglican Orders, by Leo XIII., 1896,
   "Americanism" and "Modernism" by Pius X., 1907-10, and Pius XI.'s
   encyclical on Church Union, 1928.

   Volume III. Additions giving Recent Confessional Declarations and Terms
   of Union between Church organizations. The material on the latter
   subject, so closely akin to the general topic of the book, makes it
   quite probable that Dr. Philip Schaff, in view of his pronounced
   attitude on Church fellowship and union, would have included it, were
   he himself preparing this edition of the Creeds of Christendom.

   The introductions to the works on Symbolics by Marheineke, Winer,
   Möhler, Köllner, Gunricke, Matthes, Hofmann, Oehler, contain some
   account of symbols, as also the Prolegomena to the Collections of the
   Symbols of the various Churches by Walch, Müller, Niemeyer, Kimmel,
   etc., which will be noticed in their respective places below.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Name and Definition.

   A Creed, [3] or Rule of Faith, [4] or Symbol, [5] is a confession of
   faith for public use, or a form of words setting forth with authority
   certain articles of belief, which are regarded by the framers as
   necessary for salvation, or at least for the well-being of the
   Christian Church.

   A creed may cover the whole ground of Christian doctrine and practice,
   or contain only such points as are deemed fundamental and sufficient,
   or as have been disputed. It may be declarative, or interrogative in
   form. It may be brief and popular (as the Apostles' and the Nicene
   Creeds), for general use in catechetical instruction and at baptism; or
   more elaborate and theological, for ministers and teachers, as a
   standard of public doctrine (the symbolical books of the Reformation
   period). In the latter case a confession of faith is always the result
   of dogmatic controversy, and more or less directly or indirectly
   polemical against opposing error. Each symbol bears the impress of its
   age, and the historical situation out of which it arose.

   There is a development in the history of symbols. They assume a more
   definite shape with the progress of biblical and theological knowledge.
   They are mile-stones and finger-boards in the history of Christian
   doctrine. They embody the faith of generations, and the most valuable
   results of religious controversies. They still shape and regulate the
   theological thinking and public teaching of the churches of
   Christendom. They keep alive sectarian strifes and antagonisms, but
   they reveal also the underlying agreement, and foreshadow the
   possibility of future harmony.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] From the beginning of the Apostles' Creed (Credo, I believe), to
   which the term is applied more particularly.

   [4] Kanon tes pisteos or tes aletheias, regula fidei, regula veritatis.
   These are the oldest terms used by the ante-Nicene fathers, Irenæus,
   Tertullian, etc.

   [5] Sumbolon, symbolum (from sumballein, to throw together, to
   compare), means a mark, badge, watchword, test. It was first used in a
   theological sense by Cyprian, A.D. 250 (Ep. 76, al. 69, ad Magnum,
   where it is said of the schismatic Novatianus, 'eodum symbolo, quo et
   nos, baptizare'), and then very generally since the fourth century. It
   was chiefly applied to the Apostles' Creed as the baptismal confession
   by which Christians could be known and distinguished from Jews,
   heathen, and heretics, in the sense of a military signal or watchword
   (tessera militaris); the Christians being regarded as soldiers of
   Christ fighting under the banner of the cross. Ambrose (d. 397) calls
   it ' cordis signaculum et nostræ militiæ sacramentum. ' Rufinus, in his
   Expositio in Symb. Apost., uses the word likewise in the military
   sense, but gives it also the meaning collatio, contributio (confounding
   sumbolon with sumbole), with reference to the legend of the origin of
   the creed from contributions of the twelve apostles (' quod plures in
   unum conferunt; id enim fecerunt apostoli, ' etc.). Others take the
   word in the sense of a compact, or agreement (so Suicer, Thes. eccl.
   II. 1084: ' Dicere possumus, symbolum non a militari, sed a contractuum
   tessera nomen id accepisse; est enim tessera pacti, quod in baptismo
   inimus cum Deo '). Still others derive it (with King, History of the
   Apostles' Creed, p. 8) from the signs of recognition among the heathen
   in their mysteries. Luther and Melancthon first applied it to
   Protestant creeds. A distinction is made sometimes between Symbol and
   Symbolical Book, as also between symbola publica and symbola privata.
   The term theologia symbolica is of more recent origin than the term
   libri symbolici.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Origin of Creeds.

   Faith, like all strong conviction, has a desire to utter itself before
   others--'Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh;' 'I
   believe, therefore I confess' (Credo, ergo confiteor). There is also an
   express duty, when we are received into the membership of the Christian
   Church, and on every proper occasion, to profess the faith within us,
   to make ourselves known as followers of Christ, and to lead others to
   him by the influence of our testimony. [6]

   This is the origin of Christian symbols or creeds. They never precede
   faith, but presuppose it. They emanate from the inner life of the
   Church, independently of external occasion. There would have been
   creeds even if there had been no doctrinal controversies. [7] In a
   certain sense it may be said that the Christian Church has never been
   without a creed (Ecclesia, sine symbolis nulla). The baptismal formula
   and the words of institution of the Lord's Supper are creeds; these and
   the confession of Peter antedate even the birth of the Christian Church
   on the day of Pentecost. The Church is, indeed, not founded on symbols,
   but on Christ; not on any words of man, but on the word of God; yet it
   is founded on Christ as confessed by men, and a creed is man's answer
   to Christ's question, man's acceptance and interpretation of God's
   word. Hence it is after the memorable confession of Peter that Christ
   said, 'Thou art Rock, and upon this rock I shall build my Church,' as
   if to say, 'Thou art the Confessor of Christ, and on this Confession,
   as an immovable rock, I shall build my Church.' Where there is faith,
   there is also profession of faith. As 'faith without works is dead,' so
   it may be said also that faith without confession is dead.

   But this confession need not always be written, much less reduced to a
   logical formula. If a man can say from his heart, 'I believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ,' it is sufficient for his salvation (Acts xvi. 31).
   The word of God, apprehended by a living faith, which founded the
   Christian Church, was at first orally preached and transmitted by the
   apostles, then laid down in the New Testament Scriptures, as a pure and
   unerring record for all time to come. So the confession of faith, or
   the creed, was orally taught and transmitted to the catechumens, and
   professed by them at baptism, long before it was committed to writing.
   As long as the Disciplina arcani prevailed, the summary of the
   apostolic doctrine, called 'the rule of faith,' was kept confidential
   among Christians, and withheld even from the catechumens till the last
   stage of instruction; and hence we have only fragmentary accounts of it
   in the writings of the ante-Nicene fathers. When controversies arose
   concerning the true meaning of the Scriptures, it became necessary to
   give formal expression of their true sense, to regulate the public
   teaching of the Church, and to guard it against error. In this way the
   creeds were gradually enlarged and multiplied, even to the improper
   extent of theological treatises and systems of divinity.

   The first Christian confession or creed is that of Peter, when Christ
   asked the apostles, 'Who say ye that I am?' and Peter, in the name of
   all the rest, exclaimed, as by divine inspiration, 'Thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the living God' (Matt. xvi. 16). [8] This became
   naturally the substance of the baptismal confession, since Christ is
   the chief object of the Christian faith. Philip required the eunuch
   simply to profess the belief that 'Jesus was the Son of God.' In
   conformity with the baptismal formula, however, it soon took a
   Trinitarian shape, probably in some such simple form as 'I believe in
   God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.' Gradually it was
   expanded, by the addition of other articles, into the various rules of
   faith, of which the Roman form under the title 'the Apostles' Creed'
   became the prevailing one, after the fourth century, in the West, and
   the Nicene Creed in the East. The Protestant Church, as a separate
   organization, dates from 1517, but it was not till 1530 that its faith
   was properly formularized in the Augsburg Confession.

   A symbol may proceed from the general life of the Church in a
   particular age without any individual authorship (as the Apostles'
   Creed); or from an oecumenical Council (the Nicene Creed; the Creed of
   Chalcedon); or from the Synod of a particular Church (the Decrees of
   the Council of Trent; the Articles of Dort; the Westminster Confession
   and Catechisms); or from a number of divines commissioned for such work
   by ecclesiastical authority (the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of
   England; the Heidelberg Catechism; the Form of Concord); or from one
   individual, who acts in this case as the organ of his church or sect
   (the Augsburg Confession, and Apology, composed by Melancthon; the
   Articles of Smalkald, and the Catechisms of Luther; the second Helvetic
   Confession by Bullinger). What gives them symbolical or authoritative
   character is the formal sanction or tacit acquiescence of the church or
   sect which they represent. In Congregational and Baptist churches the
   custom prevails for each local church to have its own confession of
   faith or 'covenant,' generally composed by the pastor, and derived from
   the Westminster Confession, or some other authoritative symbol, or
   drawn up independently.

   whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my

   [8] The similar confession, John vi. 69, is of a previous date. It
   reads, according to the early authorities, 'Thou art the Holy One of
   God' (su ei ho hagios theou). A designation of the Messiah. This text
   coincides with the testimony of the demoniacs, Marc. I. 26, who, with
   ghostlike intuition, perceived the supernatural character of Jesus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Authority of Creeds. [9]

   1. In the Protestant system, the authority of symbols, as of all human
   compositions, is relative and limited. It is not co-ordinate with, but
   always subordinate to, the Bible, as the only infallible rule of the
   Christian faith and practice. The value of creeds depends upon the
   measure of their agreement with the Scriptures. In the best case a
   human creed is only an approximate and relatively correct exposition of
   revealed truth, and may be improved by the progressive knowledge of the
   Church, while the Bible remains perfect and infallible. The Bible is of
   God; the Confession is man's answer to God's word. [10] The Bible is
   the norma normans; the Confession the norma normata. The Bible is the
   rule of faith (regula fidei); the Confession the rule of doctrine
   (regula doctrinæ). The Bible has, therefore, a divine and absolute, the
   Confession only an ecclesiastical and relative authority. The Bible
   regulates the general religious belief and practice of the laity as
   well as the clergy; the symbols regulate the public teaching of the
   officers of the Church, as Constitutions and Canons regulate the
   government, Liturgies and Hymn-books the worship, of the Church.

   Any higher view of the authority of symbols is unprotestant and
   essentially Romanizing. Symbololatry is a species of idolatry, and
   substitutes the tyranny of a printed book for that of a living pope. It
   is apt to produce the opposite extreme of a rejection of all creeds,
   and to promote rationalism and infidelity.

   2. The Greek Church, and still more the Roman Church, regarding the
   Bible and tradition as two co-ordinate sources of truth and rules of
   faith, claim absolute and infallible authority for their confessions of
   faith. [11]

   The Greek Church confines the claim of infallibility to the seven
   oecumenical Councils, from the first Council of Nicæa, 325, to the
   second of Nicæa, 787.

   The Roman Church extends the same claim to the Council of Trent and all
   the subsequent official Papal decisions on questions of faith down to
   the decree of the Immaculate Conception in 1854, and the dogma of Papal
   Infallibility proclaimed by the Vatican Council in 1870. Since that
   time the Pope is regarded by orthodox Romanists as the organ of
   infallibility, and all his official decisions on matters of faith and
   morals must be accepted as final, without needing the sanction of an
   oecumenical council.

   It is clear that either the Greek or the Roman Church, or both, must be
   wrong in this claim of infallibility, since they contradict each other
   on some important points, especially the authority of the pope, which
   in the Roman Church is an articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiæ, and
   is expressly taught in the Creed of Pius V. and the Vatican Decrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [9] On the authority and use of Symbols there are a number of Latin and
   German treatises by C. U. Hahn (1833), Hoefling (1835), Sartorius
   (1845), Harless (1846), A. Hahn 1847), Köllner (1847), Genzken (1851),
   Bretschneider (1830), Johannsen (1833), and others, all with special
   reference to the Lutheran State Churches in Germany. See the literature
   in Müller, Die symb. Bücher der evang. luth. Kirche, p. xv., and older
   works in Winer's Handbuch der theol. Literatur, 3d ed. Vol. I. p. 334.
   Comp. also Dunlop and Chaponnière (Part II.), cited in § 1.

   [10] For this reason a creed ought to use language different from that
   of the Bible. A string of Scripture passages would be no creed at all,
   as little as it would be a prayer or a hymn. A creed is, as it were, a
   doctrinal poem written under the inspiration of divine truth. This may
   be said at least of the oecumenical creeds.

   [11] Tertullian already speaks of the regula fidei immobilis et
   irreformabilis (De virg. vel. c. 1); but he applied it only to the
   simple form which is substantially retained in the Apostles' Creed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Value and Use of Creeds.

   Confessions, in due subordination to the Bible, are of great value and
   use. They are summaries of the doctrines of the Bible, aids to its
   sound understanding, bonds of union among their professors, public
   standards and guards against false doctrine and practice. In the form
   of Catechisms they are of especial use in the instruction of children,
   and facilitate a solid and substantial religious education, in
   distinction from spasmodic and superficial excitement. The first object
   of creeds was to distinguish the Church from the world, from Jews and
   heathen, afterwards orthodoxy from heresy, and finally denomination
   from denomination. In all these respects they are still valuable and
   indispensable in the present order of things. Every well-regulated
   society, secular or religious, needs an organization and constitution,
   and can not prosper without discipline. Catechisms, liturgies,
   hymn-books are creeds also as far as they embody doctrine.

   There has been much controversy about the degree of the binding force
   of creeds, and the quia or quatenus in the form of subscription. The
   whole authority and use of symbolical books has been opposed and
   denied, especially by Socinians, Quakers, Unitarians, and Rationalists.
   It is objected that they obstruct the free interpretation of the Bible
   and the progress of theology; that they interfere with the liberty of
   conscience and the right of private judgment; that they engender
   hypocrisy, intolerance, and bigotry; that they produce division and
   distraction; that they perpetuate religious animosity and the curse of
   sectarianism; that, by the law of reaction, they produce dogmatic
   indifferentism, skepticism, and infidelity; that the symbololatry of
   the Lutheran and Calvinistic State Churches in the seventeenth century
   is responsible for the apostasy of the eighteenth. [12] The objections
   have some force in those State Churches which allow no liberty for
   dissenting organizations, or when the creeds are virtually put above
   the Scriptures instead of being subordinated to them. But the creeds,
   as such, are no more responsible for abuses than the Scriptures
   themselves, of which they profess to be merely a summary or an
   exposition. Experience teaches that those sects which reject all creeds
   are as much under the authority of a traditional system or of certain
   favorite writers, and as much exposed to controversy, division, and
   change, as churches with formal creeds. Neither creed nor no-creed can
   be an absolute protection of the purity of faith and practice. The best
   churches have declined or degenerated; and corrupt churches may be
   revived and regenerated by the Spirit of God, and the Word of God,
   which abides forever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] These objections are noticed and answered at length by Dunlop, in
   his preface to the Collection of Scotch Confessions, and in the more
   recent works quoted on p. 7.

   § 5. Classification of Creeds.

   The Creeds of Christendom may be divided into four classes,
   corresponding to the three main divisions of the Church, the Greek,
   Latin, and Evangelical, and their common parent. A progressive growth
   of theology in different directions can be traced in them.

   1. The OEcumenical Symbols of the Ancient Catholic Church. They contain
   chiefly the orthodox doctrine of God and of Christ, or the fundamental
   dogmas of the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation. They are the common
   property of all churches, and the common stock from which the later
   symbolical books have grown.

   2. The Symbols of the Greek or Oriental Church, in which the Greek
   faith is set forth in distinction from that of the Roman Catholic and
   the evangelical Protestant Churches. They were called forth by the
   fruitless attempts of the Jesuits to Romanize the Greek Church, and by
   the opposite efforts of the crypto-Calvinistic Patriarch Cyrillus
   Lucaris to evangelize the same. They differ from the Roman Creeds
   mainly in the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit, and the
   more important doctrine of the Papacy; but in the controversies on the
   rule of faith, justification by faith, the church and the sacraments,
   the worship of saints and relics, the hierarchy and the monastic
   system, they are much more in harmony with Romanism than with
   Protestantism.

   3. The Symbols of the Roman Church, from the Council of Trent to the
   Council of the Vatican (1563 to 1870). They sanction the distinctive
   doctrines of Romanism, which were opposed by the Reformers, and condemn
   the leading principles of evangelical Protestantism, especially the
   supreme authority of the Scriptures as a sufficient rule of faith and
   practice, and justification by faith alone. The last dogma, proclaimed
   by the Vatican Council in 1870, completes the system by making the
   official infallibility of the Pope an article of the Catholic faith
   (which it never was before).

   4. The Symbols of the Evangelical Protestant Churches. Most of them
   date from the period of the Reformation (some from the seventeenth
   century), and thus precede, in part, the specifically Greek and Latin
   confessions. They agree with the primitive Catholic Symbols, but they
   ingraft upon them the Augustinian theory of sin and grace, and several
   doctrines in anthropology and soteriology (e.g., the doctrine of
   atonement and justification), which had not been previously settled by
   the Church in a conclusive way. They represent the progress in the
   development of Christian theology among the Teutonic nations, a
   profounder understanding of the Holy Scriptures (especially the Pauline
   Epistles), and of the personal application of Christ's mediatorial
   work.

   The Protestant Symbols, again, are either Lutheran or Reformed. The
   former were all made in Germany from A.D. 1530 to 1577; the latter
   arose in different countries--Germany, Switzerland, France, Holland,
   Hungary, Poland, England, Scotland, wherever the influence of Zwingli
   and Calvin extended. The Lutheran and Reformed confessions agree almost
   entirely in their theology, christology, anthropology, soteriology, and
   eschatology, but they differ in the doctrines of divine decrees and of
   the nature and efficacy of the sacraments, especially the mode of
   Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper.

   The later evangelical denominations, as the Congregationalists,
   Baptists, Quakers, Arminians, Methodists, Moravians, acknowledge the
   leading doctrines of the Reformation, but differ from Lutheranism and
   Calvinism in a number of articles touching anthropology, the Church,
   and the sacraments, and especially on Church polity and discipline.
   Their creeds are modifications and abridgments rather than enlargements
   of the old Protestant symbols.

   The heretical sects connected with Protestantism mostly reject
   symbolical books altogether, as a yoke of human authority and a new
   kind of popery. Some of them set aside even the Scriptures, and make
   their own reason or the spirit of the age the supreme judge and guide
   in matters of faith; but such loose undenominational denominations have
   generally no cohesive power, and seldom outlast their founders.

   The denominational creed-making period closed with the middle of the
   seventeenth century, except in the Roman Church, which has quite
   recently added two dogmas to her creed, viz., the Immaculate Conception
   of the Virgin Mary (1854), and the Infallibility of the Bishop of Rome
   (1870).

   If we are to look for any new creed, it will be, we trust, a creed, not
   of disunion and discord, but of union and concord among the different
   branches of Christ's kingdom.

   § 6. General Character of the OEcumenical Creeds.

   By oecumenical or general symbols (symbola oecumenica, s. catholica)
   [13] we understand the doctrinal confessions of ancient Christianity,
   which are to this day either formally or tacitly acknowledged in the
   Greek, the Latin, and the Evangelical Protestant Churches, and form a
   bond of union between them.

   They are three in number: the Apostles', the Nicene, and the Athanasian
   Creed. The first is the simplest; the other two are fuller developments
   and interpretations of the same. The Apostles' Creed is the most
   popular in the Western, the Nicene in the Eastern Churches.

   To them may be added the christological statement of the oecumenical
   Council of Chalcedon (451). It has a more undisputed authority than the
   Athanasian Creed (to which the term oecumenical applies only in a
   qualified sense), but, as it is seldom used, it is generally omitted
   from the collections.

   These three or four creeds contain, in brief popular outline, the
   fundamental articles of the Christian faith, as necessary and
   sufficient for salvation. They embody the results of the great
   doctrinal controversies of the Nicene and post-Nicene ages. They are a
   profession of faith in the only true and living God, Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost, who made us, redeemed us, and sanctifies us. They follow
   the order of God's own revelation, beginning with God and the creation,
   and ending with the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting.
   They set forth the articles of faith in the form of facts rather than
   dogmas, and are well suited, especially the Apostles' Creed, for
   catechetical and liturgical use.

   The Lutheran and Anglican Churches have formally recognized and
   embodied the three oecumenical symbols in their doctrinal and
   liturgical standards. [14] The other Reformed Churches have, in their
   confessions, adopted the trinitarian and christological doctrines of
   these creeds, but in practice they confine themselves mostly to the use
   of the Apostles' Creed. [15] This, together with the Lord's Prayer and
   the Ten Commandments, was incorporated in the Lutheran, the Genevan,
   the Heidelberg, and other standard Catechisms.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] The term oikoumenikos (from oikoumene, sc. ge, orbis terrarum, the
   inhabited earth; in a restricted sense, the old Roman Empire, as
   embracing the civilized world) was first used in its ecclesiastical
   application of the general synods of Nicæa (325), Constantinople (381),
   Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451), also of patriarchs, bishops, and
   emperors, and, at a later period, of the ancient general symbols, to
   distinguish them from the confessions of particular churches. In the
   Protestant Church the term so used occurs first in the Lutheran Book of
   Concord (oecumenica seu catholica).

   [14] The Lutheran Form of Concord (p. 569) calls them 'catholica et
   generalia summæ auctoritatis symbola.' The various editions of the Book
   of Concord give them the first place among the Lutheran symbols. Luther
   himself emphasized his agreement with them. The Church of England, in
   the 8th of her 39 Articles, declares, 'The three Creeds, Nicene Creed,
   Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles'
   Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed, for they may be
   proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.' The American
   editions of the Articles and of the Book of Common Prayer omit the
   Athanasian Creed, and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United
   States excludes it from her service. The omission by the Convention of
   1789 arose chiefly from opposition to the damnatory clauses, which even
   Dr. Waterland thought might be left out. But the doctrine of the
   Athanasian Creed is clearly taught in the first five Articles.

   [15] The Second Helvetic Confession, art. 11, the Gallican Confession,
   art. 5, and the Belgic Confession, art. 9, expressly approve the three
   Creeds, 'as agreeing with the written Word of God.' In 'The
   Constitution and Liturgy' of the (Dutch) Reformed Church in the United
   States the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed are printed at the
   end. The Apostles' Creed is embodied in the Heidelberg Catechism, as
   containing 'the articles of our catholic undoubted Christian faith.'
   The Shorter Westminster Catechism gives it merely in an Appendix, as 'a
   brief sum of the Christian faith, agreeable to the Word of God, and
   anciently received in the churches of Christ.'

   § 7. The Apostles' Creed.

   Literature.

   I. See the Gen. Lit. on the OEcum. Creeds, § 6, p. 12, especially Hahn,
   Heurtley, Lumby, Swainson, and Caspari (the third vol. 1875).

   II. Special treatises on the Apostles' Creed:

   Rufinus (d. at Aquileja 410, a presbyter and monk, translator and
   continuator of Eusebius's Church History to A.D. 395, and translator of
   some works of Origen, with unscrupulous adaptations to the prevailing
   standard of orthodoxy; at first an intimate friend, afterwards a bitter
   enemy of St. Jerome): Expositio Symboli (Apostolici), first printed,
   under the name of Jerome, at Oxford 1468, then at Rome 1470, at Basle
   1519, etc.; also in the Appendix to John Fell's ed. of Cyprian's Opera
   (Oxon. 1682, folio, p. 17 sq.), and in Rufini Opera, ed. Vallarsi (Ver.
   1745). See the list of edd. in Migne's Patrol. xxi. 17-20. The
   genuineness of this Exposition of the Creed is disputed by Ffoulkes, on
   the Athanas. Creed, p. 11, but without good reason.

   Ambrosius (bishop of Milan, d. 397): Tractatus in Symbolum Apostolorum
   (also sub tit. De Trinitate). Opera, ed. Bened., Tom. II. 321. This
   tract is by some scholars assigned to a much later date, because it
   teaches the double procession of the Holy Spirit; but Hahn, l.c. p. 16,
   defends the Ambrosian authorship with the exception of the received
   text of the Symbolum Apostolicum, which is prefixed. Also, Explanatio
   Symboli ad initiandos, ascribed to St. Ambrose, and edited by Angelo
   Mai in Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio, Rom. 1833, Vol. VII. pp.
   156-158, and by Caspari, in the work quoted above, II. 48 sq.

   Venant. Fortunatus. (d. about 600): Expositio Symboli (Opera, ed. Aug.
   Luchi, Rom. 1786).

   Augustinus. (bishop of Hippo, d. 430): De Fide et Symbolo liber unus.
   Opera, ed. Bened., Tom. XI. 505-522. Sermo de Symbolo ad catechumenos,
   Tom. VIII. 1591-1610. Sermones de traditione Symboli, Tom. VIII. 936
   sq.

   Symb. Apost. Salmur. 1663.

   Isaac Barrow (Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, d. 1677). Sermons
   on the Creed (Theolog. Works, 8 vols., Oxf. 1830, Vol. IV.-VI).

   Nichols, Chevallier). One of the classical works of the Church of
   England.

   The Apostles' Creed, or Symbolum Apostolicum, is, as to its form, not
   the production of the apostles, as was formerly believed, but an
   admirable popular summary of the apostolic teaching, and in full
   harmony with the spirit and even the letter of the New Testament.

   I. Character and Value.--As the Lord's Prayer is the Prayer of prayers,
   the Decalogue the Law of laws, so the Apostles' Creed is the Creed of
   creeds. It contains all the fundamental articles of the Christian faith
   necessary to salvation, in the form of facts, in simple Scripture
   language, and in the most natural order--the order of revelation-- from
   God and the creation down to the resurrection and life everlasting. It
   is Trinitarian, and divided into three chief articles, expressing
   faith--in God the Father, the Maker of heaven and earth, in his only
   Son, our Lord and Saviour, and in the Holy Spirit (in Deum Patrem, in
   Jesum Christum, in Spiritum Sanctum); the chief stress being laid on
   the second article, the supernatural birth, death, and resurrection of
   Christ. Then, changing the language (credo in for credo with the simple
   accusative), the Creed professes to believe 'the holy Catholic Church,
   the communion of saints, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the
   body, and the life everlasting.' [16] It is by far the best popular
   summary of the Christian faith ever made within so brief a space. It
   still surpasses all later symbols for catechetical and liturgical
   purposes, especially as a profession of candidates for baptism and
   church membership. It is not a logical statement of abstract doctrines,
   but a profession of living facts and saving truths. It is a liturgical
   poem and an act of worship. Like the Lord's Prayer, it loses none of
   its charm and effect by frequent use, although, by vain and thoughtless
   repetition, it may be made a martyr and an empty form of words. It is
   intelligible and edifying to a child, and fresh and rich to the
   profoundest Christian scholar, who, as he advances in age, delights to
   go back to primitive foundations and first principles. It has the
   fragrance of antiquity and the inestimable weight of universal consent.
   It is a bond of union between all ages and sections of Christendom. It
   can never be superseded for popular use in church and school. [17]

   At the same time, it must be admitted that the very simplicity and
   brevity of this Creed, which so admirably adapt it for all classes of
   Christians and for public worship, make it insufficient as a regulator
   of public doctrine for a more advanced stage of theological knowledge.
   As it is confined to the fundamental articles, and expresses them in
   plain Scripture terms, it admits of an indefinite expansion by the
   scientific mind of the Church. Thus the Nicene Creed gives clearer and
   stronger expression to the doctrine of Christ's divinity against the
   Arians, the Athanasian Creed to the whole doctrine of the Trinity and
   of Christ's person against the various heresies of the post-Nicene age.
   The Reformation Creeds are more explicit on the authority and
   inspiration of the Scriptures and the doctrines of sin and grace, which
   are either passed by or merely implied in the Apostles' Creed.

   II. As to the origin of the Apostles' Creed, it no doubt gradually grew
   out of the confession of Peter, Matt. xvi. 16, which furnished its
   nucleus (the article on Jesus Christ), and out of the baptismal
   formula, which determined the trinitarian order and arrangement. It can
   not be traced to an individual author. It is the product of the Western
   Catholic Church (as the Nicene Creed is that of the Eastern Church)
   within the first four centuries. It is not of primary, apostolic, but
   of secondary, ecclesiastical inspiration. It is not a word of God to
   men, but a word of men to God, in response to his revelation. It was
   originally and essentially a baptismal confession, growing out of the
   inner life and practical needs of early Christianity. [18] It was
   explained to the catechumens at the last stage of their preparation,
   professed by them at baptism, often repeated, with the Lord's Prayer,
   for private devotion, and afterwards introduced into public service.
   [19] It was called by the ante-Nicene fathers 'the rule of faith,' 'the
   rule of truth,' 'the apostolic tradition,' 'the apostolic preaching,'
   afterwards 'the symbol of faith.' [20] But this baptismal Creed was at
   first not precisely the same. It assumed different shapes and forms in
   different congregations. [21] Some were longer, some shorter; some
   declarative, some interrogative in the form of questions and answers.
   [22] Each of the larger churches adapted the nucleus of the apostolic
   faith to its peculiar circumstances and wants; but they all agreed in
   the essential articles of faith, in the general order of arrangement on
   the basis of the baptismal formula, and in the prominence given to
   Christ's death and resurrection. We have an illustration in the modern
   practice of Independent or Congregational and Baptist churches in
   America, where the same liberty of framing particular congregational
   creeds ('covenants,' as they are called, or forms of profession and
   engagement, when members are received into full communion) is exercised
   to a much larger extent than it was in the primitive ages.

   The first accounts we have of these primitive creeds are merely
   fragmentary. The ante-Nicene fathers give us not the exact and full
   formula, but only some articles with descriptions, defenses,
   explications, and applications. The creeds were committed to memory,
   but not to writing. [23] This fact is to be explained from the 'Secret
   Discipline' of the ante-Nicene Church. From fear of profanation and
   misconstruction by unbelievers (not, as some suppose, in imitation of
   the ancient heathen Mysteries), the celebration of the sacraments and
   the baptismal creed, as a part of the baptismal act, were kept secret
   among the communicant members until the Church triumphed in the Roman
   Empire. [24]

   The first writer in the West who gives us the text of the Latin creed,
   with a commentary, is Rufinus, towards the close of the fourth century.

   The most complete or most popular forms of the baptismal creed in use
   from that time in the West were those of the churches of Rome,
   Aquileja, Milan, Ravenna, Carthage, and Hippo. They differ but little.
   [25] Among these, again, the Roman formula gradually gained general
   acceptance in the West for its intrinsic excellence, and on account of
   the commanding position of the Church of Rome. We know the Latin text
   from Rufinus (390), and the Greek from Marcellus of Ancyra (336-341).
   The Greek text is usually regarded as a translation, but is probably
   older than the Latin, and may date from the second century, when the
   Greek language prevailed in the Roman congregation. [26]

   This Roman creed was gradually enlarged by several clauses from older
   or contemporaneous forms, viz., the article 'descended into Hades'
   (taken from the Creed of Aquileja), the predicate 'catholic' or
   'general,' in the article on the Church (borrowed from Oriental
   creeds), 'the communion of saints' (from Gallican sources), and the
   concluding 'life everlasting' (probably from the symbols of the
   churches of Ravenna and Antioch). [27] These additional clauses were no
   doubt part of the general faith, since they are taught in the
   Scriptures, but they were first expressed in local creeds, and it was
   some time before they found a place in the authorized formula.

   If we regard, then, the present text of the Apostles' Creed as a
   complete whole, we can hardly trace it beyond the sixth, certainly not
   beyond the close of the fifth century, and its triumph over all the
   other forms in the Latin Church was not completed till the eighth
   century, or about the time when the bishops of Rome strenuously
   endeavored to conform the liturgies of the Western churches to the
   Roman order. [28] But if we look at the several articles of the Creed
   separately, they are all of Nicene or ante-Nicene origin, while its
   kernel goes back to the apostolic age. All the facts and doctrines
   which it contains, are in entire agreement with the New Testament. And
   this is true even of those articles which have been most assailed in
   recent times, as the supernatural conception of our Lord (comp. Matt.
   i. 18; Luke i. 35), the descent into Hades (comp. Luke xxiii. 43; Acts
   ii. 31; 1 Pet. iii. 19; iv. 6), and the resurrection of the body (1
   Cor. xv. 20 sqq., and other places). [29]

   The rationalistic opposition to the Apostles' Creed and its use in the
   churches is therefore an indirect attack upon the New Testament itself.
   But it will no doubt outlive these assaults, and share in the victory
   of the Bible over all forms of unbelief. [30]

   III. I add a table, with critical notes, to show the difference between
   the original Roman creed, as given by Rufinus in Latin (about A.D.
   390), and by Marcellus in Greek (A.D. 336-341), and the received form
   of the Apostles' Creed, which came into general use in the seventh or
   eighth century. The additions are inclosed in brackets.

   Note on the Legend of the Apostolic Origin of the Creed.--Till the
   middle of the seventeenth century it was the current belief of Roman
   Catholic and Protestant Christendom that the Apostles' Creed was
   'membratim articulatimque' composed by the apostles in Jerusalem on the
   day of Pentecost, or before their separation, to secure unity of
   teaching, each contributing an article (hence the somewhat arbitrary
   division into twelve articles). [43] Peter, under the inspiration of
   the Holy Ghost, commenced: 'I believe in God the Father Almighty;'
   Andrew (according to others, John) continued: 'And in Jesus Christ, his
   only Son, our Lord;' James the elder went on: 'Who was conceived by the
   Holy Ghost;' then followed John (or Andrew): 'Suffered under Pontius
   Pilate;' Philip: 'Descended into Hades;' Thomas: 'The third day he rose
   again from the dead;' and so on till Matthias completed the work with
   the words 'life everlasting. Amen.'

   The first trace of this legend, though without the distribution alluded
   to, we find at the close of the fourth century, in the Expositio
   Symboli of Rufinus of Aquileja. He mentions an ancient tradition
   concerning the apostolic composition of the Creed ('tradunt majores
   nostri'), and falsely derives from this supposed joint authorship the
   name symbolon (from sumballein, in the sense to contribute);
   confounding sumbolon, sign, with sumbole, contribution ('Symbolum Græce
   et indicium dici potest et collatio, hoc est, quod plures in unum
   conferunt'). The same view is expressed, with various modifications, by
   Ambrosius of Milan (d. 397), in his Explanatio Symboli ad initiandos,
   where he says: 'Apostoli sancti convenientes fecerunt symbolum
   breviter;' by John Cassianus (about 424), De incarnat. Dom. VI. 3; Leo
   M., Ep. 27 ad Pulcheriam; Venantius Fortunatus, Expos. brevis Symboli
   Ap.; Isidorus of Seville (d. 636). The distribution of the twelve
   articles among the apostles is of later date, and there is no unanimity
   in this respect. See this legendary form in the pseudo-Augustinian
   Sermones de Symbolo, in Hahn, l.c. p. 24, and another from a
   Sacramentarium Gallicanum of the seventh century, in Heurtley, p. 67.

   The Roman Catechism gives ecclesiastical sanction, as far as the Roman
   Church is concerned, to the fiction of a direct apostolic authorship.
   [44] Meyers, l.c., advocates it at length, and Abbé Martigny, in his
   'Dictionnaire des antiquitées Chrétiennes,' Paris, 1865 (art. Symbole
   des apôtres, p. 623), boldly asserts, without a shadow of proof:
   'Fidèlement attaché à la tradition de l'Église catholique, nous tenons,
   non-seulement qu'il est l'oeuvre des apôtres, mais encore qu'il fut
   composé par eux, alors que réunis à Jérusalem, ils allaient se
   disperser dans l'univers entier; et qu'ils volurent, avant de séparer,
   fixer une règle de foi vraiment uniforme et catholique, destinée à être
   livrée, partout la même, aux catéchumènes.'

   Even among Protestants the old tradition has occasionally found
   advocates, such as Lessing (1778), Delbrück (1826), Rudelbach (1844),
   and especially Grundtvig (d. 1872). The last named, a very able but
   eccentric high-church Lutheran bishop of Denmark, traces the Creed,
   like the Lord's Prayer, to Christ himself, in the period between the
   Ascension and Pentecost. The poet Longfellow (a Unitarian) makes poetic
   use of the legend in his Divine Tragedy (1871).

   On the other hand, the apostolic origin (after having first been called
   in question by Laurentius Valla, Erasmus, Calvin [45] ) has been so
   clearly disproved long since by Vossius, Rivetus, Voëtius, Usher,
   Bingham, Pearson, King, Walch, and other scholars, that it ought never
   to be seriously asserted again.

   The arguments against the apostolic authorship are quite conclusive:

   1. The intrinsic improbability of such a mechanical composition. It has
   no analogy in the history of symbols; even when composed by committees
   or synods, they are mainly the production of one mind. The Apostles'
   Creed is no piece of mosaic, but an organic unit, an instinctive work
   of art in the same sense as the Gloria in Excelsis, the Te Deum, and
   the classical prayers and hymns of the Church.

   2. The silence of the Scriptures. Some advocates, indeed, pretend to
   find allusions to the Creed in Paul's 'analogy' or 'proportion of
   faith,' Rom. xii. 7; 'the good deposit,' 2 Tim. i. 14; 'the first
   principles of the oracles of God,' Heb. v. 12; 'the faith once
   delivered to the saints,' Jude, ver. 3; and 'the doctrine,' 2 John,
   ver. 10; but these passages can be easily explained without such
   assumption.

   3. The silence of the apostolic fathers and all the ante-Nicene and
   Nicene fathers and synods. Even the oecumenical Council of Nicæa knows
   nothing of a symbol of strictly apostolic composition, and would not
   have dared to supersede it by another.

   4. The variety in form of the various rules of faith in the ante-Nicene
   churches, and of the Apostolic Symbol itself down to the eighth
   century. This fact is attested even by Rufinus, who mentions the points
   in which the Creed of Aquileja differed from that of Rome. 'Such
   variations in the form of the Creed forbid the supposition of any fixed
   system of words, recognized and received as the composition of the
   apostles; for no one, surely, would have felt at liberty to alter any
   such normal scheme of faith.' [46]

   5. The fact that the Apostles' Creed never had any general currency in
   the East, where the Nicene Creed occupies its place, with an almost
   equal claim to apostolicity as far as the substance is concerned.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] This change was observed already by Rufinus (l.c. § 36), who says:
   'Non dicit "In Sanctam Ecclesiam," nec "In remissionem peccatorum," nec
   "In carnis resurrectionem." Si enim addidisset "in" præpositionem, una
   eademque vis fuisset cum superioribus. . . . Hac præpositionis syllaba
   Creator a creaturis secernitur, et divina separantur ab humanis.' The
   Roman Catechism (P. I. c. 10, qu. 19) also marks this distinction,
   'Nunc autem, mutata dicendi forma, "sanctam," et non "in sanctam"
   ecclesiam credere profitemur.'

   [17] Augustine calls the Apostolic Symbol 'regula fidei brevis et
   grandis; brevis numero verborum, grandis pondere sententiarum.' Luther
   says: 'Christian truth could not possibly be put into a shorter and
   clearer statement.' Calvin (Inst., Lib. II. c. 16, § 18), while
   doubting its strictly apostolic composition, yet regards it as an
   admirable and truly scriptural summary of the Christian faith, and
   follows its order in his Institutes, saying: 'Id extra controversiam
   positum habemus, totam in eo [Symbolo Ap.] fidei nostræ historiam
   succincte distinctoque ordine recenseri, nihil autem contineri, quod
   solidis Scripturæ testimoniis non sit consignatum.' J. T. Müller
   (Lutheran, Die Symb. Bücher der Evang. Luth. K., p. xvi.): 'It retains
   the double significance of being the bond of union of the universal
   Christian Church, and the seed from which all other creeds have grown.'
   Dr. Semisch (Evang. United, successor of Dr. Neander in Berlin)
   concludes his recent essay on the Creed (p. 28) with the words: 'It is
   in its primitive form the most genuine Christianity from the mouth of
   Christ himself (das ächteste Christenthum aus dem Munde Christi
   selbst).' Dr. Nevin (Germ. Reformed, Mercersb. Rev. 1849, p. 204): 'The
   Creed is the substance of Christianity in the form of faith . . . the
   direct immediate utterance of the faith itself.' Dr. Shedd
   (Presbyterian, Hist. Christ. Doctr., II. 433): 'The Apostles' Creed is
   the earliest attempt of the Christian mind to systematize the teachings
   of the Scripture, and is, consequently, the uninspired foundation upon
   which the whole after-structure of symbolic literature rests. All creed
   development proceeds from this germ.' Bishop Browne (Episcopalian, Exp.
   39 Art., p. 222): 'Though this Creed was not drawn up by the apostles
   themselves, it may well be called Apostolic, both as containing the
   doctrines taught by the apostles, and as being in substance the same as
   was used in the Church from the times of the apostles themselves.' It
   is the only Creed used in the baptismal service of the Latin, Anglican,
   Lutheran, and the Continental Reformed Churches. In the Protestant
   Episcopal and Lutheran Churches the Apostles' Creed is a part of the
   regular Sunday service, and is generally recited between the Scripture
   lessons and the prayers, expressing assent to the former, and preparing
   the mind for the latter.

   [18] Tertullian, De corona militum. c. 3: 'Dehinc ter mergitamur,
   amplius aliquid respondentes, quam Dominus in Evangelio determinavit.'
   The amplius respondentes refers to the Creed, not as something
   different from the Gospel, but as a summary of the Gospel. Comp. De
   bapt., c. 6, where Tertullian says that in the baptismal Creed the
   Church was mentioned after confessing the Father, the Son, and the
   Spirit.

   [19] Augustine (Op., ed. Bened., VI. Serm., 58): 'Quando surgitis,
   quando vos ad somnum collocatis, reddite Symbolum vestrum; reddite
   Domino. . . . Ne dicatis, Dixi heri, dixi hodie, quotidie dico, teneo
   illud bene. Commemora fidem tuam: inspice te. Sit tanquam speculum tibi
   Symbolum tuum. Ibi te vide si credis omnia quæ te credere confiteris,
   et gaude quotidie in fide tua.'

   archaion tes ekklesias, sustema, regula fidei, reg. veritatis, traditio
   apostolica, prædicatio ap., fides catholica, etc. Sometimes these terms
   are used in a wider sense, and embrace the whole course of catechetical
   instruction.

   [21] See the older regulæ fidei mentioned by Irenæus: Contra hær., lib.
   I. c. 10, § 1; III. c. 4, § 1, 2; IV. c. 33, § 7; Tertullian: De
   velandis virginibus, c. 1; Adv. Praxeam, c. 2; De præscript. hæret., c.
   13; Novatianus: De trinitate s. de regula fidei (Bibl. P. P., ed.
   Galland. III. 287); Cyprian: Ep. ad Magnum, and Ep. ad Januarium, etc.;
   Origen: De principiis, I. præf. § 4-10; Const. Apost. VI. 11 and 14.
   They are given in Vol. II. pp. 11-40; also by Bingham, Walch, Hahn, and
   Heurtley. I select, as a specimen, the descriptive account of
   Tertullian, who maintained against the heretics very strongly the unity
   of the traditional faith, but, on the other hand, also against the
   Roman Church (as a Montanist), the liberty of discipline and progress
   in Christian life. De velandis virginibus, c. 1: 'Regula quidem fidei
   una omnino est, sola immobolis et irreformabilis, credendi scilicet in
   unicum Deum omnipotentem, mundi conditorem, et Filium ejus Jesum
   Christum, natum ex virgine Maria, crucifixum sub Pontio Pilato, tertia
   die resuscitatum a mortuis, receptum in cælis, sedentem nunc ad
   dexteram Patris, venturum judicare vivos et mortuos, per carnis
   etiamresurrectionem. Hac lege fidei manente cætera jam disciplinæ et
   conversationis admittunt novitatem correctionis, operante scilicet et
   proficiente usque in finem gratia Dei.' In his tract against Praxeas
   (cap. 2) he mentions also, as an object of the rule of faith, 'Spiritum
   Sanctum, paracletum, sanctificatorem fidei eorum qui credunt in Patrem
   et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum.' We may even go further back to the
   middle and the beginning of the second century. The earliest trace of
   some of the leading articles of the Creed may be found in Ignatius,
   Epistola ad Trallianos, c. 9 (ed. Hefele, p. 192), where he says of
   Christ that he was truly born 'of the Virgin Mary' (tou ek Marias, hos
   alethos egennethe), 'suffered under Pontius Pilate' (alethos ediochthe
   epi Pontiou Pilatou), 'was crucified and died' (alethos estaurothe kai
   apethanen,) and 'was raised from the dead' (hos kai alethos egerthe apo
   nekron, egeirantos auton tou patros, autou.) The same articles, with a
   few others, can be traced in Justin Martyr's Apol. I. c. 10, 13, 21,
   42, 46, 50.

   omnipotentem, etc.? Resp. Credo. 2. Credis et in Jesum Christum, etc.?
   Resp. Credo. 3. Credis et in Spiritum Sanctum, etc.? Resp. Credo. See
   the interrogative Creeds in Martene, De antiquis ecclesiæ ritibus, 1.

   symbolum discitur, nec in tabulis vel in aliqua materia, sed in corde
   scribitur.'

   [24] On the Disciplina arcani comp. my Church History, I. 384 sq., and
   Semisch, On the Ap. Creed, p. 17, who maintains, with others, that the
   Apostles' Creed existed in full as a part of the Secret Discipline long
   before it was committed to writing.

   [25] See these Nicene and post-Nicene Creeds in Hahn, l.c. pp. 3 sqq.,
   and in Heurtley, l.c. 43 sqq. Augustine (and pseudo-Augustine) gives
   eight expositions of the Symbol, and mentions, besides, single articles
   in eighteen passages of his works. See Caspari, l.c. II. 264 sq. He
   follows in the main the (Ambrosian) form of the Church of Milan, which
   agrees substantially with the Roman. Twice he takes the North African
   Symbol of Carthage for a basis, which has additions in the first
   article, and puts the article on the Church to the close (vitam æternam
   per sanctam ecclesiam). We have also, from the Nicene and post-Nicene
   age, several commentaries on the Creed by Cyril of Jerusalem, Rufinus,
   Ambrose, and Augustine. They do not give the several articles
   continuously, but it is easy to collect and to reconstruct them from
   the comments in which they are expounded. Cyril expounds the Eastern
   Creed, the others the Western. Rufinus takes that of the Church of
   Aquileja, of which he was presbyter, as the basis, but notes
   incidentally the discrepancy between this Creed and that of the Church
   of Rome, so that we obtain from him the text of the Roman Creed as
   well. He mentions earlier expositions of the Creed, which were lost (In
   Symb. § 1).

   [26] See Caspari, Vol. III. pp. 28-161.

   [27] The last clause occurs in the Greek text of Marcellus and in the
   baptismal creed of Antioch (kai eis hamartion aphein kai eis nekron
   anastasin kai eis zoen aionion). See Caspari, Vol. I. pp. 83 sqq.

   [28] Heurtley says (l.c. p. 126): 'In the course of the seventh century
   the Creed seems to have been approaching more and more nearly, and more
   and more generally, to conformity with the formula now in use; and
   before its close, instances occur of creeds virtually identical with
   that formula. The earliest creed, however, which I have met with
   actually and in all respects identical with it, that of Pirminius, does
   not occur till the eighth century; and even towards the close of the
   eighth, A.D. 785, there is one remarkable example of a creed, then in
   use, which retains much of the incompleteness of the formula of earlier
   times, the Creed of Etherius Uxamensis.' The oldest known copies of our
   present textus receptus are found in manuscripts of works which can not
   be traced beyond the eighth or ninth century, viz., in a 'Psalterium
   Græcum Gregorii Magni,' preserved in the Library of Corpus Christi
   College, Cambridge, and first published by Abp. Usher, 1647 (also by
   Heurtley, l.c. p. 82), and another in the 'Libellus Pirminii [who died
   758] de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus' (=collectus), published by
   Mabillon (Analecta, Tom. IV. p. 575). The first contains the Creed in
   Latin and Greek (both, however, in Roman letters), arranged in two
   parallel columns; the second gives first the legend of the Creed with
   the twelve articles assigned to the twelve apostles, and then the Latin
   Creed as used in the baptismal service. See Heurtley, p. 71.

   [29] The same view of the origin of the Apostles' Creed is held by the
   latest writers on the subject, as Hahn, Heurtley, Caspari, Zöckler,
   Semisch. Zöckler says (l.c. p. 18): 'Das Apostolicum ist hinsichtlich
   seiner jetzigen Form sowohl nachapostolisch, als selbst
   nachaugustinisch, aber hinsichtlich seines Inhalts ist es nicht nur
   voraugustinisch, sondern ganz und gar apostolisch--in diesen einfachen
   Satz lässt die Summe der einschlägigen kritisch patristischen
   Forschungsergebnisse sich kurzerhand zusammendrängen. Und die Wahrheit
   dieses Satzes, soweit er die Apostolicität des Inhalts behauptet, lässt
   sich bezüglich jedes einzelnen Gliedes oder Sätzchens, die am spätesten
   hinzugekommenen nicht ausgenommen, mit gleicher Sicherheit erhärten.'
   Semisch traces the several articles, separately considered, up to the
   third and second centuries, and the substance to the first. Fr.
   Spanheim and Calvin did the same. Calvin says: 'Neque mihi dubium est,
   quin a prima statim ecclesiæ origine, adeoque ab ipso Apostolorum
   seculo instar publicæ et omnium calculis receptæ confessionis
   obtinuerit' (Inst. lib. II. c. 16, § 18). The most elaborate argument
   for the early origin is given by Caspari, who derives the Creed from
   Asia Minor in the beginning of the second century (Vol. III. pp.
   1-161).

   [30] The discussion of the Apostles' Creed entered a stage of great
   warmth after Dr. Schaff's death, 1893. The work by Kattenbusch, the
   most extensive and exhaustive on the subject, was followed by
   treatments from the pens of Harnack, Cremer, Zahn, Loofs, Kunze, and
   others in Germany, Burn, and Badcock, 1930, in England and McGiffert in
   the United States. The early Roman baptismal formula is carried by
   Harnack and Mirbt to 150 or earlier, and by Kattenbusch and Zahn to 120
   or earlier. A. Seeberg found the clauses in the New Testament writings
   and held that a creedal formula was in use in Apostolic times.
   McGiffert, who was followed by Krüger, proposed the theory that the
   formula was a reply to the heresies of Marcion about 160. Badcock
   opposes the view of Kattenbusch, Harnack, and Burn on the origin of the
   Apostles' Creed, relying in part upon Irenaeus's recently found
   treatise, "The teaching of the Apostles." The renewed study of the
   Apostles' Creed was followed by a new study of the doctrine of the
   Virgin birth of Christ in view of the omission of the clause "conceived
   by the Holy Ghost" in the forms of the Rule of Faith known to us and
   the statement of the early Roman baptismal formula, "born of the Holy
   Ghost and the Virgin Mary." The most recent treatise on the Virgin
   birth is by Machen, The Virgin Birth of Christ, N. Y., 1930.--Ed.

   [31] The Creed of Aquileja has, after Patrem omnipotentem, the
   addition: 'invisibilem et impassibilem,' in opposition to Sabellianism
   and Patripassianism. The Oriental creeds insert one before God.
   Marcellus omits Father, and reads eis theon pantokratora.

   [32] 'Creatorem coeli et terræ' appears in the Apostles' Creed from the
   close of the seventh century, but was extant long before in ante-Nicene
   rules of faith (Irenæus, Adv. hoer. I. c. 10, 1; Tertullian, De vel.
   virg. c. l, 'mundi conditorem;' De proescr. hæret. c. 13), in the
   Nicene Creed (poieten ouranou kai ges, k.t.l.), and all other Eastern
   creeds, in opposition to the Gnostic schools, which made a distinction
   between the true God and the Maker of the world (the Demiurge).

   [33] 'Qui natus est de Spiritu Sancto ex (or et) Maria virgine.'

   [34] 'Qui CONCEPTUS est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria virgine.' The
   distinction between conception and birth first appears in the Sermones
   de Tempore, falsely attributed to Augustine.

   [35] 'Passus,' perhaps from the Nicene Creed (pathonta, which there
   implies the crucifixion). In some forms 'crucifixus,' in others
   'mortuus' is omitted.

   [36] From the Aquilejan Creed: 'Descendit ad inferna,' or, as the
   Athanasian Creed has it, 'ad inferos,' to the inhabitants of the
   spirit-world. Some Eastern (Arian) creeds: katebe eis ton haden (also
   eis ta katachthonia, or eis ta katotata). Augustine says (Ep. 99, al.
   164, § 3) that unbelievers only deny 'fuisse apud inferos Christum.'
   Venantius Fortunatus, A.D. 570, who had Rufinus before him, inserted
   the clause in his creed. Rufinus himself, however, misunderstood it by
   making it to mean the same as buried (§ 18: 'vis verbi eadem videtur
   esse in eo quod sepultus dicitur').

   [37] The additions 'Dei' and 'omnipotentis,' made to conform to article
   first, are traced to the Spanish version of the Creed as given by
   Etherius Uxamensis (bishop of Osma), A.D. 785, but occur already in
   earlier Gallican creeds. See Heurtley, pp. 60, 67.

   [38] 'Credo,' in common use from the time of Petrus Chrysologus, d.
   450. But And, without the repetition of the verb, is no doubt the
   primitive form, as it grew immediately out of the baptismal formula,
   and gives clearer and closer expression to the doctrine of the Trinity.

   [39] 'Catholicam' (universal), in accordance with the Nicene Creed, and
   older Oriental forms, was received into the Latin Creed before the
   close of the fourth century (comp. Augustine: De Fide et Symbolo, c.
   10). The term catholic, as applied to the Church, occurs first in the
   Epistles of Ignatius (Ad Smyrnæos, cap. 8: hosper hopou an e Christos
   Iesous, ekei he katholike ekklesia and in the Martyrium Polycarpi
   (inscription, and cap. 8: hapases tes kata ten oikoumenen katholikes
   ekklesias, comp. c. 19, where Christ is called poimen tes kata
   oikoumenen katholikes ekklesias.

   [40] The article 'Commumionem sanctorum,' unknown to Augustine (Enchir.
   c. 64, and Serm. 213), appears first in the 115th and 118th Sermons De
   Tempore, falsely attributed to him. It is not found in any of the Greek
   or earlier Latin creeds. See the note of Pearson On the Creed, Art. IX.
   sub 'The Communion of Saints' (p. 525, ed. Dobson). Heurtley, p. 146,
   brings it down to the close of the eighth century, since it is wanting
   in the Creed of Etherius, 785. The oldest commentators understood it of
   the communion with the saints in heaven, but afterwards it assumed a
   wider meaning: the fellowship of all true believers, living and
   departed.

   [41] The Latin reads carnis, the Greek sarkos, flesh; the Aquilejan
   form hujus carnis, of this flesh (which is still more realistic, and
   almost materialistic), 'ut possit caro vel pudica coronari, vel
   impudica puniri' (Rufinus, § 43). It should be stated, however, that
   there are two other forms of the Aquilejan Creed given by Walch (xxxiv.
   and xxxv.) and by Heurtley (pp. 30-32), which differ from the one of
   Rufinus, and are nearer the Roman form.

   [42] Some North African forms (of Carthage and Hippo Regius) put the
   article of the Church at the close, in this way: 'vitam eternam per
   sanctam ecclesiam.' Others: carnis resurrectionem in vitam æternam. The
   Greek Creed of Marcellus, which otherwise agrees with the old Roman
   form, ends with zoen aionion.

   [43] The old Roman form has only eleven articles, unless art. 6 be
   divided into two; while the received text has sixteen articles, if
   'Maker of heaven and earth,' 'He descended into Hades,' 'the communion
   of saints,' and 'the life everlasting,' are counted separately.

   [44] Pars prima, cap. 1, qu. 2 (Libri Symbolici Eccl. Cath., ed.
   Streitwolf and Klener, Tom. I. p. 111): 'Quæ igitur primum Christiani
   homines tenere debent, illa sunt, quæ fidei duces, doctoresque sancti
   Apostoli, divino Spiritu afflati, duodecim Symboli articulis
   distinxerunt. Nam, cum mandatum a Domino accepissent, ut pro ipso
   legatione fungentes, in universum mundum proficiscerentur, atque omni
   creaturæ Evangelium prædicarent: Christianæ fidei formulam componendam
   censuerunt, ut scilicet id omnes sentirent ac dicerent, neque ulla
   essent inter eos schismata,' etc. Ibid. qu. 3: 'Hanc autem Christianæ
   fidei et spei professionem a se compositam Apostoli Symbolum
   appellarunt; sive quia ex variis sententiis, quas singuli in commune
   contulerunt, conflata est; sive quia ea veluti nota, et tessera quandam
   uterentur, qua desertores et subintroductos falsos fratres, qui
   Evangelium adulterabant, ab iis, qui veræ Christi militiæ sacramento se
   obligarent, facile possent internoscere.'

   [45] In his Catechism, Calvin says that the formula of the common
   Christian faith is called symbolum apostolorum, quod vel ab ore
   apostolorum excepta fuerit, vel ex eorum scriptis fideliter collecta.

   [46] Dr. Nevin (l.c. p. 107), who otherwise puts the highest estimate
   on the Creed. See the comparative tables on the gradual growth of the
   Creed in the second volume of this work.

   extensive literature on the Council of Nicæa, mentioned in my Church

   collected in Greek and Latin by Mansi, Collect. sacr. Concil., Tom. II.
   fol. 635-704. The Council of Nicæa is more or less fully discussed in
   the historical works, general or particular, of Tillemont, Walch,

   Doctrine of the Trinity), Dorner (History of Christology), Hefele

   translation in the Anglo-Catholic Library, Oxf. 1851, 2 vols.

   The Nicene Creed, or Symbolum Nicæno-Constantinopolitanum, is the
   Eastern form of the primitive Creed, but with the distinct impress of
   the Nicene age, and more definite and explicit than the Apostles' Creed
   in the statement of the divinity of Christ and the Holy Ghost. The
   terms 'coessential' or 'coequal' (homoousios to patri), 'begotten
   before all worlds' (pro panton ton aionon), 'very God of very God'
   (theos alethinos ek theou alethinou), 'begotten, not made' (gennetheis,
   ou poietheis), are so many trophies of orthodoxy in its mighty struggle
   with the Arian heresy, which agitated the Church for more than half a
   century. The Nicene Creed is the first which obtained universal
   authority. It rests on older forms used in different churches of the
   East, and has undergone again some changes. [47]

   The Eastern creeds arose likewise out of the baptismal formula, and
   were intended for the baptismal service as a confession of the faith of
   the catechumen in the Triune God. [48]

   We must distinguish two independent or parallel creed formations, an
   Eastern and a Western; the one resulted in the Nicene Creed as
   completed by the Synod of Constantinople, the other in the Apostles'
   Creed in its Roman form. The Eastern creeds were more metaphysical,
   polemical, flexible, and adapting themselves to the exigencies of the
   Church in the maintenance of her faith and conflict with heretics; the
   Western were more simple, practical, and stationary. The former were
   controlled by synods, and received their final shape and sanction from
   two oecumenical Councils; the latter were left to the custody of the
   several churches, each feeling at liberty to make additions or
   alterations within certain limits, until the Roman form superseded all
   others, and was quietly, and without formal synodical action, adopted
   by Western Christendom.

   In the Nicene Creed we must distinguish three forms--the original
   Nicene, the enlarged Constantinopolitan, and the still later Latin.

   1. The original Nicene Creed dates from the first oecumenical Council,
   which was held at Nicæa, A.D. 325, for the settlement of the Arian
   controversy, and consisted of 318 bishops, all of them from the East
   (except Hosius of Spain). This Creed abruptly closes with the words
   'and in the Holy Ghost,' but adds an anathema against the Arians. This
   was the authorized form down to the Council of Chalcedon.

   2. The Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Creed, besides some minor changes in
   the first two articles, [49] adds all the clauses after 'Holy Ghost,'
   but omits the anathema. It gives the text as now received in the
   Eastern Church. It is usually traced to the second oecumenical Council,
   which was convened by Theodosius in Constantinople, A.D. 381, against
   the Macedonians or Pneumatomachians (so called for denying the deity of
   the Holy Spirit), and consisted of 150 bishops, all from the East.
   There is no authentic evidence of an oecumenical recognition of this
   enlarged Creed till the Council at Chalcedon, 451, where it was read by
   Aëtius (a deacon of Constantinople) as the 'Creed of the 150 fathers,'
   and accepted as orthodox, together with the old Nicene Creed, or the
   'Creed of the 318 fathers.' But the additional clauses existed in 374,
   seven years before the Constantinopolitan Council, in the two creeds of
   Epiphanius, a native of Palestine, and most of them as early as 350, in
   the creed of Cyril of Jerusalem. [50]

   The Nicene Creed comes nearest to that of Eusebius of Cæsarea, which
   likewise abruptly closes with pneuma hagion; the Constantinopolitan
   Creed resembles the creeds of Cyril and Epiphanius, which close with
   'the resurrection' and 'life everlasting.' We may therefore trace both
   forms to Palestine, except the Nicene homoousion.

   3. The Latin or Western form differs from the Greek by the little word
   Filioque, which, next to the authority of the Pope, is the chief source
   of the greatest schism in Christendom. The Greek Church, adhering to
   the original text, and emphasizing the monarchia of the Father as the
   only root and cause of the Deity, teaches the single procession
   (ekporeusis) of the Spirit from the Father alone, which is supposed to
   be an eternal inner-trinitarian process (like the eternal generation of
   the Son), and not to be confounded with the temporal mission (pempsis)
   of the Holy Spirit by the Father and the Son. The Latin Church, in the
   interest of the co-equality of the Son with the Father, and taking the
   procession (processio) in a wider sense, taught since Augustine the
   double procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son, and,
   without consulting the East, put it into the Creed.

   The first clear trace of the Filioque in the Nicene Creed we find at
   the third Council of Toledo in Spain, A.D. 589, to seal the triumph of
   orthodoxy over Arianism. During the eighth century it obtained currency
   in England and in France, but not without opposition. Pope Leo III.,
   when asked by messengers of a council held during the reign of
   Charlemagne at Aix la Chapelle, A.D. 809, to sanction the Filioque,
   decided in favor of the double procession, but against any change in
   the Creed. Nevertheless, the clause gained also in Italy from the time
   of Pope Nicholas I. (858), and was gradually adopted in the entire
   Latin Church. From this it passed into the Protestant Churches. [51]

   Another addition in the Latin form, 'Deus de Deo,' in article II.,
   created no difficulty, as it was in the original Nicene Creed, but it
   is useless on account of the following 'Deus verus de Deo vero,' and
   hence was omitted in the Constantinopolitan edition.

   The Nicene Creed (without these Western additions) is more highly
   honored in the Greek Church than in any other, and occupies the same
   position there as the Apostles' Creed in the Latin and Protestant
   Churches. It is incorporated and expounded in all the orthodox Greek
   and Russian Catechisms. It is also (with the Filioque) in liturgical
   use in the Roman (since about the sixth century), and in the Anglican
   and Lutheran Churches. [52] It was adopted by the Council of Trent as
   the fundamental Symbol, and embodied in the Profession of the
   Tridentine Faith by Pius IV. It is therefore more strictly an
   oecumenical Creed than the Apostles' and the Athanasian, which have
   never been fully naturalized in the Oriental Churches.

   . . 'The faith of the Trinity lies,

   Shrined for ever and ever, in those grand old words and wise;

   A gem in a beautiful setting; still, at matin-time,

   The service of Holy Communion rings the ancient chime;

   Wherever in marvelous minster, or village churches small,

   Men to the Man that is God out of their misery call,

   Swelled by the rapture of choirs, or borne on the poor man's word,

   Still the glorious Nicene confession unaltered is heard;

   Most like the song that the angels are singing around the throne,

   With their "Holy! holy! holy!" to the great Three in One.' [53]

   The relation of the Nicene Creed to the Apostles' Creed may be seen
   from the following table:

   [But those who say: 'There was a time when he was not;' and 'He was not
   before he was made;' and 'He was made out of nothing,' or 'He is of
   another substance' or 'essence,' or 'The Son of God is created,' or
   'changeable,' or 'alterable'--they are condemned by the holy catholic
   and apostolic Church.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [47] Compare the symbols of the church of Jerusalem, the church of
   Alexandria, and the creed of Cæsarea, which Eusebius read at the
   Council of Nicæa, in Usher, l.c. pp. 7, 8; more fully in Vol. II. pp.
   11 sqq., and in Hahn, Bibliothek der Symbole, pp. 40 sqq., 91 sqq.

   [48] Eusebius, in his Epistle to the people of Cæsarea, says of the
   creed which he had proposed to the Council of Nicæa for adoption, that
   he had learned it as a catechumen, professed it at his baptism, taught
   it in turn as presbyter and bishop, and that it was derived from our
   Lord's baptismal formula. It resembles the old Nicene Creed very
   closely; see Vol. II. p. 29. The shorter creed of Jerusalem used at
   baptism, as given by Cyril, Catech. xix. 9, is simply the baptismal
   formula put interrogatively; see Hahn, pp. 51 sqq.

   [49] The most remarkable change in the first article is the omission of
   the words poutestin ek tes ousias tou Patros, theon ek theou on which
   great stress was laid by the Athanasian party against the Arians, who
   maintained that the Son was not of the essence, but of the will of the
   Father.

   [50] See Vol. II. pp. 31-38, and the Comparative Table, p. 40; Lumby,
   p. 68; and Hort, pp. 72-150. Dr. Hort tries to prove that the
   'Constantinopolitan' or Epiphanian Creed is not a revision of the
   Nicene Creed at all, but of the Creed of Jerusalem, and that it dates
   probably from Cyril, about 362-364, when he adopted the Nicene
   homoousia, and may have been read by him at the Council of
   Constantinople in vindication of his orthodoxy. Ffoulkes (in Smith's
   Dict. of Christ. Antiq. Vol. I. p. 438) conjectures that it was framed
   at Antioch about 372, and adopted at the supplemental Council of
   Constantinople, 382.

   [52] In the Reformed Churches, except the Episcopal, the Nicene Creed
   is little used. Calvin, who had a very high opinion of the Apostles'
   Creed, depreciates the Nicene Creed, as a 'carmen cantillando magis
   aptum, quam confessionis formula' (De Reform. Eccles.).

   Alexander, in 'The Contemporary Review' for February, 1867, pp.

   [54] The Greek reads the plural (pisteuomen), but the Latin and English
   versions have substituted for it the singular (credo, I believe), in
   accordance with the Apostles' Creed and the more subjective character
   of the Western churches.

   [55] The Greek reads eis mian . . . ekklesian, but the Latin and
   English versions, in conformity with the Apostles' Creed, mostly omit
   in before ecclesiam; see p. 15.

   [56] Here and in art. 11 the singular is substituted in Western
   translations for homologoumen and prosdokomen.

   confession, by Eusebius in his Epistola ad Cæsareenses, which is
   preserved by Athanasius at the close of his Epistola de decretis Synodi

   The Creed of Chalcedon was adopted at the fourth and fifth sessions of
   the fourth oecumenical Council, held at Chalcedon, opposite
   Constantinople, A.D. 451 (Oct. 22d and 25th). It embraces the
   Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Creed, and the christological doctrine set
   forth in the classical Epistola Dogmatica of Pope Leo the Great to
   Flavian, the Patriarch of Constantinople and martyr of diophysitic
   orthodoxy at the so-called Council of Robbers (held at Ephesus in 449).
   [59]

   While the first Council of Nicæa had established the eternal,
   pre-existent Godhead of Christ, the Symbol of the fourth oecumenical
   Council relates to the incarnate Logos, as he walked upon earth and
   sits on the right hand of the Father. It is directed against the errors
   of Nestorius and Eutyches, who agreed with the Nicene Creed as opposed
   to Arianism, but put the Godhead of Christ in a false relation to his
   humanity. It substantially completes the orthodox Christology of the
   ancient Church; for the definitions added during the Monophysite and
   Monothelite controversies are few and comparatively unessential. As the
   Nicene doctrine of the Trinity stands midway between Tritheism and
   Sabellianism, so the Chalcedonian formula strikes the true mean between
   Nestorianism and Eutychianism.

   The following are the leading ideas of the Chalcedonian Christology as
   embodied in this symbol: [60]

   1. A true incarnation of the Logos, or the second person in the Godhead
   (enanthropesis theou, ensarkosis tou logou, incarnatio Verbi).) [61]
   This incarnation is neither a conversion or transmutation of God into
   man, nor a conversion of man into God, and a consequent absorption of
   the one, or a confusion (krasis, sunchusis) of the two; nor, on the
   other hand, a mere indwelling (enoikesis, inhabitatio) of the one in
   the other, nor an outward, transitory connection (sunapheia,
   conjunctio) of the two factors, but an actual and abiding union of the
   two in one personal life.

   2. The precise distinction between nature and person. Nature or
   substance (essence, ousia) denotes the totality of powers and qualities
   which constitute a being; while person (hupostasis, prosopon) is the
   Ego, the self-conscious, self-asserting and acting subject. The Logos
   assumed, not a human person (else we would have two persons, a divine
   and a human), but human nature which is common to us all; and hence he
   redeemed, not a particular man, but all men as partakers of the same
   nature.

   3. The God-Man as the result of the incarnation. Christ is not a
   (Nestorian) double being, with two persons, nor a compound
   (Apollinarian or Monophysite) middle being, a tertium quid, neither
   divine nor human; but he is one person both divine and human.

   4. The duality of the natures. The orthodox doctrine maintains, against
   Eutychianism, the distinction of nature even after the act of
   incarnation, without confusion or conversion (asunchutos, inconfuse,
   and atreptos, immutabiliter), yet, on the other hand, without division
   or separation (adiairetos, indivise, and achoristos, inseparabiliter),
   so that the divine will ever remain divine, and the human ever human,
   [62] and yet the two have continually one common life, and
   interpenetrate each other, like the persons of the Trinity. [63]

   5. The unity of the person (henosis kath' hupostasin, henosis
   hupostatike, unio hypostatica or unio personalis). The union of the
   divine and human nature in Christ is a permanent state resulting from
   the incarnation, and is a real, supernatural, personal, and inseparable
   union--in distinction from an essential absorption or confusion, or
   from a mere moral union; or from a mystical union such as holds between
   the believer and Christ. The two natures constitute but one personal
   life, and yet remain distinct. 'The same who is true God,' says Leo,
   'is also true man, and in this unity there is no deceit; for in it the
   lowliness of man and the majesty of God perfectly pervade one another.
   . . . Because the two natures make only one person, we read on the one
   hand: "The Son of Man came down from heaven" (John iii. 13), while yet
   the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin; and on the other hand: "The
   Son of God was crucified and buried," [64] while yet he suffered, not
   in his Godhead as coeternal and consubstantial with the Father, but in
   the weakness of human nature.' The self-consciousness of Christ is
   never divided; his person consists in such a union of the human and the
   divine natures, that the divine nature is the seat of
   self-consciousness, and pervades and animates the human.

   6. The whole work of Christ is to be attributed to his person, and not
   to the one or the other nature exclusively. The person is the acting
   subject, the nature the organ or medium. It is the one divine-human
   person of Christ that wrought miracles by virtue of his divine nature,
   and that suffered through the sensorium of his human nature. The
   superhuman effect and infinite merit of the Redeemer's work must be
   ascribed to his person because of his divinity; while it is his
   humanity alone that made him capable of, and liable to, toil,
   temptation, suffering, and death, and renders him an example for our
   imitation.

   7. The anhypostasia, impersonality, or, to speak more accurately, the
   enhypostasia, of the human nature of Christ; [65] for anhypostasia is a
   purely negative term, and presupposes a fictitious abstraction, since
   the human nature of Christ did not exist at all before the act of the
   incarnation, and could therefore be neither personal nor impersonal.
   The meaning of this doctrine is that Christ's human nature had no
   independent personality of its own, besides the divine, and that the
   divine nature is the root and basis of his personality. [66]

   There is, no doubt, a serious difficulty in the old orthodox
   Christology, if we view it in the light of our modern psychology. We
   can conceive of a human nature without sin (for sin is a corruption,
   not an essential quality, of man), but we can not conceive of a human
   nature without personality, or a self-conscious and free Ego; for this
   distinguishes it from the mere animal nature, and is man's crowning
   excellency and glory. To an unbiased reader of the Gospel history,
   moreover, Christ appears as a full human personality, thinking,
   speaking, acting, suffering like a man (only without sin),
   distinguishing himself from other men and from his heavenly Father,
   addressing him in prayer, submitting to him his own will, and
   commending to him his spirit in the hour of death. [67] Yet, on the
   other hand, be appears just as clearly in the Gospels as a personality
   in the most intimate, unbroken, mysterious life-union with his heavenly
   Father, in the full consciousness of a personal pre-existence before
   the creation, of having been sent by the Father from heaven into this
   world, of living in heaven even during this earthly abode, and of being
   ever one with him in will and in essence. [68] In one word, he makes
   the impression of a theanthropic, divine-human person. [69] His human
   personality was completed and perfected by being so incorporated with
   the pre-existent Logos-personality as to find in it alone its full
   self-consciousness, and to be permeated and controlled by it in every
   stage of its development.

   The Chalcedonian Christology has latterly been subjected to a rigorous
   criticism (by Schleiermacher, Baur, Dorner, Rothe, and others), and has
   been charged with a defective psychology, and now with dualism, now
   with docetism, according as its distinction of two natures or of the
   personal unity has most struck the eye. But these imputations
   neutralize each other, like the imputations of tritheism and modalism,
   which may be made against the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity when
   either the tri-personality or the consubstantiality is taken alone.
   This, indeed, is the peculiar excellence of the Creed of Chalcedon,
   that it exhibits so sure a tact and so wise a circumspection in uniting
   the colossal antithesis in Christ, and seeks to do justice alike to the
   distinction of the natures and to the unity of the person. In Christ
   all contradictions are reconciled.

   The Chalcedonian Creed is far from exhausting the great mystery of
   godliness, 'God manifest in flesh.' It leaves much room for a fuller
   appreciation of the genuine, perfect, and sinless humanity of Christ,
   of the Pauline doctrine of the Kenosis, or self-renunciation and
   self-limitation of the Divine Logos in the incarnation and during the
   human life of our Lord, and for the discussion of other questions
   connected with his relation to the Father and to the world, his person
   and his work. But it indicates the essential elements of Christological
   truth, and the boundary-lines of Christological error. It defines the
   course for the sound development of this central article of the
   Christian faith so as to avoid both the Scylla of Nestorian dualism and
   the Charybdis of Eutychian monophysitism, and to save the full idea of
   the one divine-human personality of our Lord and Saviour. Within these
   limits theological speculation may safely and freely move, and bring us
   to clearer conceptions; but in this world, where we 'know only in part
   (ek merous),' and 'see through a mirror obscurely (di esoptrou en
   ainigmati)' it will never fully comprehend the great central mystery of
   the theanthropic life of our Lord.

   [60] Abridged, in part, from My Church History, Vol. III. pp. 747 sqq.

   [61] The diametrical opposite of the enanthropesis theou is the heathen
   apotheosis anthropou.

   [62] 'Tenet,' says Leo, in his Epist. 28 ad Flavian., 'sine defectu
   proprietatem suam utraque natura, et sicut formam servi Dei forma non
   adimit, ita formam Dei servi forma non minuit. . . . Agit utraque forma
   cum alterius communione quod proprium est; Verbo scilicet operante quod
   Verbi est, et carne exsequente quod carnis est. Unum horum coruscat
   miraculis, aliud succumbit injuriis. Et sicut Verbum ab æqualitate
   paternæ gloriæ non recedit, ita caro naturam nostri generis non
   relinquit.'

   [63] Here belongs, in further explanation, the scholastic doctrine of
   the perichoresis, permeatio, circummeatio, circulatio, circumincessio,
   intercommunio, or reciprocal indwelling and pervasion, which has
   relation, not merely to the Trinity, but also to Christology. The verb
   perichorein is first applied by Gregory of Nyssa (Contra Apollinarium)
   to the interpenetration and reciprocal pervasion of the two natures in
   Christ. On this rested also the doctrine of the exchange or
   communication of attributes, antidosis, antimetastasis, koinonia
   idiomaton, communicatio idiomatum. The antimetastasis ton onomaton,
   also antimedistasis, transmutatio proprietatum, transmutation of
   attributes, is, strictly speaking, not identical with antidosis, but a
   deduction from it, and the rhetorical expression for it.

   [64] Comp. 1 Cor. ii. 8: 'They would not have crucified the Lord of
   glory.'

   [65] Anupostatos is that which has no personality in itself,
   enupostatos that which subsists in another personality, or partakes of
   another hypostasis.

   [66] The doctrine of the impersonality of the human nature of Christ
   may already be found as to its germ in Cyril of Alexandria, and was
   afterwards more fully developed by John of Damascus (De orthodoxa fide,
   lib. III.), and by the Lutheran scholastics of the seventeenth century,
   who, however, did not, for all this, conceive Christ as a mere generic
   being typifying mankind, but as a concrete human individual. Comp.
   Petavius, De incarnatione, lib. V. c. 5-8 (Tom. IV. pp. 421 sqq.);
   Thomasius, Christol. II. 108-110; Rothe, Dogmatik, II. 51 and 147.

   [67] He calls himself a 'man,' anthropos (John viii. 40; comp. xix. 5),
   and very often 'the Son of man,' and other men his 'brethren' (John xx.
   17).

   [68] John viii.58; xvii. 5, 24; iii. 11-13; v. 37; vi. 38, 62; viii.
   42; x. 30, and many other passages in the Gospels. Dr. R. Rothe, who
   rejects the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and the Incarnation, yet
   expressly admits (Dogmatik, II. 88): 'Ebenso bestimmt, wie seine wahre
   Menschheit, tritt im Neuen Testament auch die wahre GOTTHEIT des
   Erlösers hervor.' To escape the orthodox inference of an incarnation of
   a divine hypostasis, Rothe must resort (p. 100) to the Socinian
   interpretation of John xvii. 5, where the Saviour asserts his
   pre-existence with the Father (doxason me su, pater, para seauto te
   doxe, he eichon pro tou ton kosmon einai para soi); thereby
   distinguishing himself from the hypostasis of the Father, and yet
   asserting coeternity. The Socinians and Grotius find here merely an
   ideal glory in the divine counsel; but it must be taken, in analogy
   with similar passages, of a real, personal, self-conscious
   pre-existence, and a real glory attached to it; otherwise it would be
   nothing peculiar and characteristic of Christ. How absurd would it be
   for a man to utter such a prayer!

   [69] A persona sunthetos, in the language of the old Protestant
   divines. Divina et humana naturæ' (says Hollaz), 'in una persona
   suntheto Filii Dei existentes, unam eandemque habent hupostasin, modo
   tamen habendi diversam. Natura enim divina eam habet primario, per se
   et independenter, natura autem humana secundario, propter unionem
   personalem, adeoque participative. The divine nature, therefore, is, in
   the orthodox system, that which forms and constitutes the personality
   (das personbildende Princip.).

   The Athanasian Creed is also called Symbolum Quicunque, from the first
   word, 'Quicunque vult salvus esse.' [70]

   I. Its origin is involved in obscurity, like that of the Apostles'
   Creed, the Gloria in Excelsis, and the Te Deum. It furnishes one of the
   most remarkable examples of the extraordinary influence which works of
   unknown or doubtful authorship have exerted. Since the ninth century it
   has been ascribed to Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, the chief
   defender of the divinity of Christ and the orthodox doctrine of the
   Trinity (d. 373). [71] The great name of 'the father of orthodoxy'
   secured for it an almost oecumenical authority, notwithstanding the
   solemn prohibition of the third and fourth oecumenical Councils to
   compose or publish any other creed than the Nicene. [72]

   Since the middle of the seventeenth century the Athanasian authorship
   has been abandoned by learned Catholics as well as Protestants. The
   evidence against it is conclusive. The Symbol is nowhere found in the
   genuine writings of Athanasius or his contemporaries and eulogists. The
   General Synods of Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon
   (451) make no allusion to it whatever. It seems to presuppose the
   doctrinal controversies of the fifth century concerning the
   constitution of Christ's person; at least it teaches substantially the
   Chalcedonian Christology. And, lastly, it makes its first appearance in
   the Latin Churches of Gaul, North Africa, and Spain: while the Greeks
   did not know it till the eleventh century, and afterwards rejected or
   modified it on account of the Occidental clause on the procession of
   the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son. The Greek texts, moreover,
   differ widely, and betray, by strange words and constructions, the
   hands of unskilled translators.

   The pseudo-Athanasian Creed originated in the Latin Church from the
   school of St. Augustine, probably in Gaul or North Africa. It borrows a
   number of passages from Augustine and other Latin fathers. [73] It
   appears first in its full form towards the close of the eighth or the
   beginning of the ninth century. Its structure and the repetition of the
   damnatory clause in the middle and at the close indicate that it
   consists of two distinct parts, which may have been composed by two
   authors, and afterwards welded together by a third hand. The first
   part, containing the Augustinian doctrine of the Trinity, is fuller and
   more metaphysical. The second part, containing a summary of the
   Chalcedonian Christology, has been found separately, as a fragment of a
   sermon on the Incarnation, at Treves, in a MS. from the middle of the
   eighth century. [74] The fact that Athanasius spent some time in exile
   at Treves may possibly have given rise to the tradition that the great
   champion of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity composed the whole.
   [75]

   II. Character and Contents.--The Symbolum Quicunque is a remarkably
   clear and precise summary of the doctrinal decisions of the first four
   oecumenical Councils (from A.D. 325 to A.D. 451), and the Augustinian
   speculations on the Trinity and the Incarnation. Its brief sentences
   are artistically arranged and rhythmically expressed. It is a musical
   creed or dogmatic psalm. Dean Stanley calls it 'a triumphant pæan' of
   the orthodox faith. It resembles, in this respect, the older Te Deum,
   but it is much more metaphysical and abstruse, and its harmony is
   disturbed by a threefold anathema.

   It consists of two parts.

   The first part (ver. 3-28) sets forth the orthodox doctrine of the Holy
   Trinity, not in the less definite Athanasian or
   Nicæno-Constantinopolitan, but in its strictest Augustinian form, to
   the exclusion of every kind of subordination of essence. It is
   therefore an advance both on the Nicene Creed and the Apostles' Creed;
   for these do not state the doctrine of the Trinity in form, but only
   indirectly by teaching the Deity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and
   leave room for a certain subordination of the Son to the Father, and
   the Holy Spirit to both. The post-Athanasian formula states clearly and
   unmistakably both the absolute unity of the divine being or essence,
   and the tri-personality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
   God is one in three persons or hypostases, each person expressing the
   whole fullness of the Godhead, with all his attributes. The term
   persona is taken neither in the old sense of a mere personation or form
   of manifestation (prosopon, face, mask), nor in the modern sense of an
   independent, separate being or individual, but in a sense which lies
   between these two conceptions, and thus avoids Sabellianism on the one
   hand, and Tritheism on the other. The divine persons are in one
   another, and form a perpetual intercommunication and motion within the
   divine essence. [76] Each person has all the divine attributes which
   are inherent in the divine essence, but each has also a characteristic
   individuality or property, [77] which is peculiar to the person, and
   can not be communicated; the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten,
   the Holy Ghost is proceeding. In this Trinity there is no priority or
   posteriority of time, no superiority or inferiority of rank, but the
   three persons are coeternal and coequal.

   If the mystery of the Trinity can be logically defined, it is done
   here. But this is just the difficulty: the infinite truth of the
   Godhead lies far beyond the boundaries of logic, which deals only with
   finite truths and categories. It is well always to remember the saying
   of Augustine: 'God is greater and truer in our thoughts than in our
   words; he is greater and truer in reality than in our thoughts.' [78]

   The second part (ver. 29-44) contains a succinct statement of the
   orthodox doctrine concerning the person of Christ, as settled by the
   general Councils of Ephesus 431 and Chalcedon 451, and in this respect
   it is a valuable supplement to the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds. It
   asserts that Christ had a rational soul (nous, neuma), in opposition to
   the Apollinarian heresy, which limited the extent of his humanity to a
   mere body with an animal soul inhabited by the divine Logos. It also
   teaches the proper relation between the divine and human nature of
   Christ, and excludes the Nestorian and Eutychian or Monophysite
   heresies, in essential agreement with the Chalcedonian Symbol. [79]

   III. The Damnatory Clauses.--The Athanasian Creed, in strong contrast
   with the uncontroversial and peaceful tone of the Apostles' Creed,
   begins and ends with the solemn declaration that the catholic faith in
   the Trinity and the Incarnation herein set forth is the indispensable
   condition of salvation, and that those who reject it will be lost
   forever. The same damnatory clause is also wedged in at the close of
   the first and at the beginning of the second part. This threefold
   anathema, in its natural historical sense, is not merely a solemn
   warning against the great danger of heresy, [80] nor, on the other
   hand, does it demand, as a condition of salvation, a full knowledge of,
   and assent to, the logical statement of the doctrines set forth (for
   this would condemn the great mass even of Christian believers); but it
   does mean to exclude from heaven all who reject the divine truth
   therein taught. It requires every one who would be saved to believe in
   the only true and living God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one in
   essence, three in persons, and in one Jesus Christ, very God and very
   Man in one person.

   The damnatory clauses, especially when sung or chanted in public
   worship, grate harshly on modern Protestant ears, and it may well be
   doubted whether they are consistent with true Christian charity and
   humility, and whether they do not transcend the legitimate authority of
   the Church. They have been defended by an appeal to Mark xvi. 16; but
   in this passage those only are condemned who reject the gospel, i.e.,
   the great facts of Christ's salvation, not any peculiar dogma.
   Salvation and damnation depend exclusively on the grace of God as
   apprehended by a living faith, or rejected in ungrateful unbelief. The
   original Nicene Symbol, it is true, added a damnatory clause against
   the Arians, but it was afterwards justly omitted. Creeds, like hymns,
   lose their true force and miss their aim in proportion as they are
   polemical and partake of the character of manifestoes of war rather
   than confessions of faith and thanks to God for his mighty works. [81]

   IV. Introduction and Use.--The Athanasian Creed acquired great
   authority in the Latin Church, and during the Middle Ages it was almost
   daily used in the morning devotions. [82]

   The Reformers inherited the veneration for this Symbol. It was formally
   adopted by the Lutheran and several of the Reformed Churches, and is
   approvingly mentioned in the Augsburg Confession, the Form of Concord,
   the Thirty-nine Articles, the Second Helvetic, the Belgic, and the
   Bohemian Confessions. [83]

   Luther was disposed to regard it as 'the most important and glorious
   composition since the days of the apostles.' [84]

   Some Reformed divines, especially of the Anglican Church have commended
   it very highly; even the Puritan Richard Baxter lauded it as 'the best
   explication [better, statement] of the Trinity,' provided, however,
   'that the damnatory sentences be excepted, or modestly expounded.'

   In the Church of England it is still sung or recited in the cathedrals
   and parish churches on several festival days, [85] but this compulsory
   public use meets with growing opposition, and was almost unanimously
   condemned in 1867 by the royal commission appointed to consider certain
   changes in the Anglican Ritual. [86]

   The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, when, in
   consequence of the American Revolution, it set up a separate
   organization in the Convention of 1785 at Philadelphia, resolved to
   remodel the Liturgy (in 'the Proposed Book'), and, among other changes,
   excluded from it both the Nicene and the Athanasian Creeds, and struck
   out from the Apostles' Creed the clause, 'He descended into hell.' The
   Archbishops of Canterbury and York, before consenting to ordain bishops
   for America, requested their brethren to restore the clause of the
   Apostles' Creed, and 'to give to the other two Creeds a place in their
   Book of Common Prayer, even though the use of them should be left
   discretional.' [87] In the Convention held at Wilmington Del., October
   10, 1786, the request of the English prelates, as to the first two
   points, was acceded to, but 'the restoration of the Athanasian Creed
   was negatived.' As the opposition to this Creed was quite determined,
   especially on account of the damnatory clauses, the mother Church
   acquiesced in the omission, and granted the desired Episcopal
   ordination. [88]

   In the Greek Church it never obtained general currency or formal
   ecclesiastical sanction, and is only used for private devotion, with
   the omission of the clause on the double procession of the Spirit. [89]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [70] It first bears the title, 'Fides sanctæ Trinitatis,' or 'Fides
   Catholica Sanctæ Trinitatis;' then (in the 'Cod. Usserius secundus')
   'Fides Sancti Athanasii Alexandrini.' Hincmar of Rheims, about A.D.
   852, calls it 'Sermonem Athanasii de fide, cujus initium est:
   "Quicunque vult salvus esse."'

   [71] According to the mediæval legend, Athanasius composed it during
   his exile in Rome, and offered it to Pope Julius as his confession of
   faith. So Baronius, Petavius, Bellarmin, etc. This tradition was first
   opposed and refuted by Gerhard Vossius (1642) and Ussher (1647).

   [72] Conc. Ephes. Can. VII. 'The holy Synod has determined that no
   person shall be allowed to bring forward, or to write, or to compose
   any other Creed (heteran pistin medeni exeinai propherein egoun
   sungraphein e suntithenai), besides that which was settled by the holy
   fathers who assembled in the city of Nicæa, with the Holy Spirit. But
   those who shall dare to compose any other Creed, or to exhibit or
   produce any such, if they are bishops or clergymen, they shall be
   deposed, but if they are of the laity, they shall be anathematized.'
   The Council of Chalcedon (451), although setting forth a new definition
   of faith, repeated the same prohibition (after the Defin. Fidei).

   [73] See the parallel passages in Waterland's treatise and in my Church
   History, Vol. III. pp. 690 sqq.

   [74] Now known as the Colbertine MS., in Paris, which is assigned to
   about A.D. 730-760, but is derived in part from older MSS. This
   fragment was first published consecutively by Professor Swainson in
   1871, and again in his larger work, 1875 (p. 262), also by Lumby, p.
   215. It begins thus: 'Est ergo fides recta ut credamus et confitemur
   quia Dominus ihesus christus Dei filius, deus pariter et homo est,'
   etc.; and it ends: 'Hæc est fides sancta et Catholica, quam omnes
   [omnis] homo qui ad uitam æternam peruenire desiderat scire integræ
   [integre] debet, et fideliter custodire.' The compiler of the two parts
   intensified the damnatory clause by changing it into 'quam nisi quisque
   fideliter firmiterque crediderit, salvus esse non poterit.' The
   passages quoted by Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, A.D. 852, are all
   taken from the first part.

   [75] The authorship of the Symbolum Quicunque is a matter of mere
   conjecture. The opinions of scholars are divided between Hilary of
   Arles (420-431), Vigilius of Tapsus (484), Vincentius Lirinensis (450),
   Venantius Fortunatus of Poitiers (570), Pope Anastasius (398),
   Victricius of Rouen (401), Patriarch Paulinus of Aquileja
   (Charlemagne's favorite theologian, d. 804). Waterland learnedly
   contends for Hilary of Arles; Quesnel, Cave, Bingham, and Neander for
   Vigilius Tapsensis of North Africa. Gieseler traces the Quicunque to
   the Councils of Toledo in Spain (633, 638, 675, etc.), which used to
   profess the Nicene Creed with additional articles (like the Filioque)
   against Arianism. Ffoulkes (who seceded to Rome, and returned, a better
   Protestant, to the Church of England) and Dean Stanley maintain that it
   arose in France, simultaneously with the forgery of the
   pseudo-Isidorean Decretals, for controversial purposes against the
   Greeks, to set up a fictitious antiquity for Latin doctrine (the
   Filioque), as the Decretals did for Latin polity. Swainson and Lumby
   assign the Creed to an unknown writer of the age of Charlemagne (d.
   814) and Alcuin (d. 804), or to the period between 813 and 850.

   The latest investigations since the rediscovery of the oldest (the
   Cotton) MS. in the 'Utrecht Psalter' (which was exposed for inspection
   at the British Museum in 1873, and has since been photographed) are
   unfavorable to an early origin; for this MS., which Ussher and
   Waterland assigned to the sixth century, dates probably from the ninth
   century (as the majority of scholars who investigated it, Drs.
   Vermuelen, Heurtley, Ffoulkes, Lumby, Swainson, contend against Hardy,
   Westwood, and Baron van Westreenen), since, among other reasons, it
   contains also the Apostles' Creed in its final form of 750. The
   authorship of Venantius Fortunatus (570) was simply inferred by
   Muratori from the common name 'Fortunatus' at the head of a MS.
   (Expositio Fidei Catholicæ Fortunati) which contains a commentary on
   the Athanasian Creed, but which is not older than the eleventh century,
   and quotes a passage from Alcuin. Two other MSS. of the same
   commentary, but without a title, have been found, one at Florence, and
   one at Vienna (Lumby, p. 208; Swainson, pp. 317 sqq.). The internal
   evidence for an earlier date is equally inconclusive. The absence of
   Mater Dei (theotokos) no more proves an ante-Nestorian origin (before
   431, as Waterland contended) than the absence of consubstantialis
   (homoousios) proves an ante-Nicene origin.

   So far, then, we have no proof that the pseudo-Athanasian Creed in its
   present complete shape existed before the beginning of the ninth
   century. And yet it may have existed earlier. At all events, two
   separate compositions, which form the groundwork of our Quicunque, are
   of older date, and the doctrinal substance of it, with the most
   important passages, may be found in the works of St. Augustine and his
   followers, with the exception of the damnatory clauses, which seem to
   have had their origin in the fierce contests of the age of Charlemagne.
   In a Prayer-Book of Charles the Bald, written about A. D. 870, we find
   the Athanasian Creed very nearly in the words of the received text.

   I may add that the indefatigable investigator, Dr. Caspari, of
   Christiania, informs me by letter (dated April 29, 1876) that he is
   still inclined to trace this Creed to the fifth century, between 450
   and 600, and that he found, and will publish in due time, some old
   symbols which bear a resemblance to it, and may cast some light upon
   its obscure origin. Adhuc sub judice lis est.

   [76] The later scholastic terms for this indwelling and
   interpenetration are perichoresis, inexistentia, permeatio,
   circumincessio, etc. See my Church History, Vol. III. p. 680.

   [77] Called by the Greeks idiotes or idion, by the Latins proprietas
   personalis or character hypostaticus.

   [78] 'Verius cogitatur Deus quam dicitur, verius est quam cogitatur,'
   De Trinitate, lib. VII. c. 4, § 7. Dr. Isaac Barrow, one of the
   intellectual giants of the Anglican Church (died 1677), in his Defense
   of the Blessed Trinity (a sermon preached on Trinity Sunday, 1663),
   humbly acknowledges the transcendent incomprehensibility, while clearly
   stating the facts, of this great mystery: 'The sacred Trinity may be
   considered either as it is in itself wrapt up in inexplicable folds of
   mystery, or as it hath discovered itself operating in wonderful methods
   of grace towards us. As it is in itself, 'tis an object too bright and
   dazzling for our weak eye to fasten upon, an abyss too deep for our
   short reason to fathom; I can only say that we are so bound to mind it
   as to exercise our faith, and express our humility, in willingly
   believing, in submissively adoring those high mysteries which are
   revealed in the holy oracles concerning it by that Spirit itself which
   searcheth the depths of God. . . . That there is one Divine Nature or
   Essence, common unto three Persons, incomprehensibly united, and
   ineffably distinguished--united in essential attributes, distinguished
   by peculiar idioms and relations; all equally infinite in every divine
   perfection, each different from the other in order and manner of
   subsistence; that there is a mutual inexistence of one in all, and all
   in one, a communication without any deprivation or diminution in the
   communicant; an eternal generation, and an eternal procession, without
   precedence or succession, without proper causality or dependence; a
   Father imparting his own, and the Son receiving his Father's life, and
   a Spirit issuing from both, without any division or multiplication of
   essence--these are notions which may well puzzle our reason in
   conceiving how they agree, but should not stagger our faith in
   assenting that they are true; upon which we should meditate, not with
   hope to comprehend, but with dispositions to admire, veiling our faces
   in the presence, and prostrating our reason at the feet, of Wisdom so
   far transcending us.'

   [79] See the preceding section.

   [80] So a majority of the 'Ritual Commission of the Church of England,'
   appointed in 1867: 'The condemnations in this Confession of Faith are
   to be no otherwise understood than as a solemn warning of the peril of
   those who willfully reject the Catholic faith.' Such a warning would be
   innocent and unobjectionable, indeed, but fall far short of the spirit
   of an age which abhorred heresy as the greatest of crimes, to be
   punished by death.

   [81] 'It seems very hard,' says Bishop Jeremy Taylor, 'to put
   uncharitableness into a creed, and so to make it become an article of
   faith.' Chillingworth: 'The damning clauses in St. Athanasius's Creed
   are most false, and also in a high degree schismatical and
   presumptuous.'

   [82] J. Bona, De divina Psalmodia, c. 16, § 18, p. 863 (as quoted by
   Köllner, Symbolik, I. 85): 'Illud Symbolum olim, teste Honorio,
   quotidie est decantatum, jam vero diebus Dominicis in totius coetus
   frequentia recitatur, ut sanctæ fidei confessio ea die apertius
   celebretur.'

   [83] It is printed, with the two other oecumenical Creeds, in all the
   editions of the Lutheran 'Book of Concord,' and as an appendix to the
   doctrinal formulas of the Reformed Dutch Church in America. It was
   received into the 'Provisional Liturgy of the German Reformed Church in
   the United States,' published Philadelphia, 1858, but omitted in the
   revised edition of 1867.

   [84] 'Es ist also gefasset, dass ich nicht weiss, ob seit der Apostel
   Zeit in der Kirche des Neuen Testamentes etwas Wichtigeres and
   Herrlicheres geschrieben sei' (Luther, Werke, ed. Walch, VI. 2315).

   [85] The rubric directs that the Athanasian Creed 'shall be sung or
   said at Morning Prayer, instead of the Apostles' Creed, on
   Christmas-day, the Epiphany, St. Matthias, Easter-day, Ascension-day,
   Whitsunday, St. John the Baptist, St. James, St. Bartholomew, St.
   Matthew, St. Simon and St. Jude, St. Andrew, and upon Trinity Sunday.'

   [86] By nineteen out of the twenty-seven members of the Ritual
   Commission. See their opinions in Stanley, l.c. pp. 73 sqq. Dean
   Stanley on that occasion urged no less than sixteen reasons against the
   public use of the Athanasian Creed. On the other hand, Dr. Pusey has
   openly threatened to leave the Established Church if the Athanasian
   Creed, and with it the doctrinal status of that Church, should be
   disturbed. Brewer's defense is rather feeble. Bishop Ellicott proposed,
   in the Convocation of Canterbury, to relieve the difficulty by a
   revision of the English translation, e.g. by rendering vult salvus
   esse, 'desires to be in a state of salvation,' instead of 'will be
   saved.' Others suggest an omission of the damnatory clauses. But the
   true remedy is either to omit the Athanasian Creed altogether from the
   Book of Common Prayer, or to leave its public use optional.

   Episcopal Church in the United States of America, New York, 2d ed.
   1836, pp 305, 306.

   [88] White's Memoires, 26, 27. Bishop White himself was decidedly
   opposed to the Creed, as was Bishop Provost, of New York. The
   Archbishop of Canterbury told them afterwards: 'Some wish that you had
   retained the Athanasian Creed; but I can not say that I feel uneasy on
   the subject, for you have retained the doctrine of it in your Liturgy,
   and as to the Creed itself, I suppose you thought it not suited to the
   use of a congregation' (l.c. 117, 118).

   Canterbury, following a resolution of the Lambeth Conference, 1908,
   appointed a commission of seven, including Bp. Wordsworth of Salisbury,
   Prof. Swete and Dean Kilpatrick, to prepare a revision of the English
   translation of the Athanas. Creed. Their report proposed thirteen minor
   changes. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer prescribed that the Creed
   be said or sung at morning prayer on thirteen feasts, including
   Christmas, Easter, Ascension day, and Trinity Sunday. By the order of
   both Convocations it was omitted and a new rubric inserted, making its
   use optional on Trinity Sunday. In the "Revised" Book of Common Prayer,
   recommended by the House of Bishops and rejected by Parliament, 1928,
   the following rubrics are printed side by side, making the use of the
   creed optional: "may be sung or said at morning or evening prayer" on
   the first Sunday after Christmas, the feast of the Annunciation, and
   Trinity Sunday.  2.  On Trinity Sunday, the recitation beginning with
   clause 3, "The Catholic faith is this," etc., and closing with clause
   28.  3.  On the Sunday after Christmas and Ascension day, the
   recitation being from clause 30 to clause 41.  4.  On all the thirteen
   festivals mentioned in the original Book of Common Prayer. A "revised
   translation is added" which differs from the translation of 1909. See

   pp. and 1918, 23 pp. Also the Book of Com. Prayer with the Additions
   and Deviations Proposed in 1928, with Pref., Cambr. Press, 1928. By

   special service is provided.--Ed.

   § 11. The Seven OEcumenical Councils.

   The entire Orthodox Greek or Oriental Church, [90] including the Greek
   Church in Turkey, the national Church in the kingdom of Greece, and the
   national Church of the Russian Empire, and embracing a membership of
   about eighty millions, adopts, in common with the Roman communion, the
   doctrinal decisions of the seven oldest oecumenical Councils, laying
   especial stress on the Nicene Council and Nicene Creed. These Councils
   were all summoned by Greek emperors, and controlled by Greek patriarchs
   and bishops. They are as follows:

   I. The first Council of Nicæa, A.D. 325; called by Constantine M.

   II. The first Council of Constantinople, A.D. 381; called by Theodosius
   M.

   III. The Council of Ephesus, A.D. 431; called by Theodosius II.

   IV. The Council of Chalcedon, A.D. 451; called by Emperor Marcian and
   Pope Leo I.

   V. The second Council of Constantinople, A.D. 553; called by Justinian
   I.

   VI. The third Council of Constantinople, A.D. 680; called by
   Constantine Pogonatus.

   VII. The second Council of Nicæa, A.D. 787; called by Irene and her son
   Constantine.

   The first four Councils are by far the most important, as they settled
   the orthodox faith on the Trinity and the Incarnation. The fifth
   Council, which condemned the Three (Nestorian) Chapters, is a mere
   supplement to the third and fourth. The sixth condemned Monothelitism.
   The seventh sanctioned the use and worship of images. [91]

   To these the Greek Church adds the Concilium Quinisextum, [92] held at
   Constantinople (in Trullo), A.D. 691 (or 692), and frequently also that
   held in the same city A.D. 879 under Photius the Patriarch; while the
   Latins reject these two Synods as schismatic, and count the Synod of
   869 (the fourth of Constantinople), which deposed Photius and condemned
   the Iconoclasts, as the eighth oecumenical Council. But these
   conflicting Councils refer only to discipline and the rivalry between
   the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Pope of Rome.

   The Greek Church celebrates annually the memory of the seven holy
   Synods, held during the palmy days of her history, on the first Sunday
   in Lent, called the 'Sunday of Orthodoxy,' when the service is made to
   reproduce a dramatic picture of an oecumenical Council, with an
   emperor, the patriarchs, metropolitans, bishops, priests, and deacons
   in solemn deliberation on the fundamental articles of faith. She looks
   forward to an eighth oecumenical Council, which is to settle all the
   controversies of Christendom subsequent to the great schism between the
   East and the West.

   Since the last of the seven Councils, the doctrinal system of the Greek
   Church has undergone no essential change, and become almost petrified.
   But the Reformation, especially the Jesuitical intrigues and the
   crypto-Calvinistic movement of Cyril Lucar in the seventeenth century,
   called forth a number of doctrinal manifestoes against Romanism, and
   still more against Protestantism. We may divide them into three
   classes:

   I. Primary Confessions of public authority:

      (a) The 'Orthodox Confession,' or Catechism of Peter Mogilas, 1643,
   indorsed by the Eastern Patriarchs and the Synod of Jerusalem.

      (b) The Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem, or the Confession of
   Dositheus, 1672.

      To the latter may be added the similar but less important decisions
   of the Synods of Constantinople, 1672 (Responsio Dionysii), and 1691
   (on the Eucharist).

      (c) The Russian Catechisms which have the sanction of the Holy
   Synod, especially the Longer Catechism of Philaret (Metropolitan of
   Moscow), published by the synodical press, and generally used in Russia
   since 1839.

      (d) The Answers of Jeremiah, Patriarch of Constantinople, to certain
   Lutheran divines, in condemnation of the doctrines of the Augsburg
   Confession, 1576 (published at Wittenberg, 1584), were sanctioned by
   the Synod of Jerusalem, but are devoid of clearness and point, and
   therefore of little use.

   II. Secondary Confessions of a mere private character, and hence not to
   be used as authorities:

      (a) The two Confessions of Gennadius, Patriarch of Constantinople,
   1453. One of them, purporting to give a dialogue between the Patriarch
   and the Sultan, is spurious, and the other has nothing characteristic
   of the Greek system.

      (b) The Confession of Metrophanes Critopulus, subsequently Patriarch
   of Alexandria, composed during his sojourn in Germany, 1625. It is more
   liberal than the primary standards.

   III. Different from both classes is the Confession of Cyril Lucar,
   1629, which was repeatedly condemned as heretical (Calvinistic), but
   gave occasion for the two most important expositions of Eastern
   orthodoxy.

   We shall notice these documents in their historical order.

   [90] The full name of the Greek Church is 'the Holy Oriental Orthodox
   Catholic Apostolic Church.' The chief stress is laid on the title
   orthodox. The name Graikos, used by Polybius and since as equivalent to
   the Latin Græcus, was by the Greeks themselves always regarded as an
   exotic. Homer has three standing names for the Greeks: Danaoi, Argeioi,
   and Achaioi; also Panthellenes and Panachaioi. The ancient (heathen)
   Greeks called themselves Hellenes, the modern (Slavonic) Greeks, till
   recently, Romans, in distinction from the surrounding Turks. The Greek
   language, since the founding of the East Roman empire, was called
   Romaic.

   [91] Worship in a secondary sense, or douleia, including aspasmos kai
   timetike proskunesis, but not that adoration or alethine latreia, which
   belongs only to God. See Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, Bd. III. p. 440.

   [92] This Synod is called Quinisexta or penthekte, because it was to be
   a supplement to the fifth and sixth oecumenical Councils, which had
   passed doctrinal decrees, but no canons of discipline. It is also
   called the second Trullan Synod, because it was held 'in Trullo,' a
   saloon of the imperial palace in Constantinople. The Greeks regard the
   canons of this Synod as the canons of the fifth and sixth oecumenical
   Councils, but the Latins never acknowledged the Quinisexta, and called
   it mockingly 'erratica.' As the dates of the Quinisexta are variously
   given 686, 691, 692, 712. Comp. Baronius, Annal. ad ann. 692, No. 7,

   § 12. The Confessions of Gennadius, A.D. 1453.

   J. C. T. Otto: Des Patriarchen Gennadios von Konstantinopel Confession,
   Wien, 1864 (35 pp.).

   See also the work of Gass, quoted p. 43, on Gennadius and Pletho
   (1844), and an article of Prof. Otto on the Dialogue ascribed to
   Gennadius, in (Niedner's) Zeitschrift für historische Theologie for
   1850, III. 399-417.

   The one or two Confessions which the Constantinopolitan Patriarch
   Gennadius handed to the Turkish Sultan Mahmoud or Mahomet II., in 1453,
   comprise only a very general statement of the ancient Christian
   doctrines, without entering into the differences which divide the
   Oriental Church from the Latin Communion; yet they have a historical
   importance, as reflecting the faith of the Greek Church at that time.

   Georgius Scholarius, a lawyer and philosopher, subsequently called
   Gennadius, was among the companions and advisers of the Greek Emperor
   John VII., Palæologus, and the Patriarch Joasaph, when they, in
   compliance with an invitation of Pope Eugenius IV., attended the
   Council of Ferrara and Florence (A.D. 1438 and '39), to consider the
   reunion of the Eastern and Western Catholic Churches. Scholarius,
   though not a member of the Synod (being a layman at the time), strongly
   advocated the scheme, while his more renowned countryman, Georgius
   Gemistus, commonly called Pletho (d. 1453), opposed it with as much
   zeal and eloquence. Both were also antagonists in philosophy, Gennadius
   being an Aristotelian, Pletho a Platonist. The union party triumphed,
   especially through the influence of Cardinal Bessarion (Archbishop of
   Nicæa), who at last acceded to the Latin Filioque, as consistent with
   the Greek per Filium. [93]

   But when the results of the Council were submitted to the Greek Church
   for acceptance, the popular sentiment, backed by a long tradition,
   almost universally discarded them. Scholarius, who in the mean time had
   become a monk, was compelled to give up his plans of reunion, and he
   even wrote violently against it. Some attribute this inconsistency to a
   change of conviction, some to policy; while others, without good
   reason, doubt the identity of the anti-Latin monk Scholarius with the
   Latinizing Gennadius. [94]

   Immediately after the conquest in 1453, Scholarius was elected
   Patriarch of Constantinople, but held this position only a few years,
   as he is said to have abdicated in 1457 or 1459, and retired to a
   convent. This elevation is sufficient proof of his Greek orthodoxy, but
   may have been aided by motives of policy, inspired by the vain hope of
   securing, through his influence with the Latin church dignitaries, the
   assistance of the Western nations against the Turkish invasion.

   At the request of the Mohammedan conqueror, Gennadius prepared a
   Confession of the Christian faith. The Sultan received it, invested
   Gennadius with the patriarchate by the delivery of the crozier or
   pastoral staff, and authorized him to assure the Greek Christians of
   freedom in the exercise of their religion. [95]

   This 'Confession' of Gennadius, [96] or 'Homily on the true faith of
   the Christians,' was written in Greek, and translated into the
   Turko-Arabic (the Turkish with Arabic letters) for the use of the
   Sultan. [97] It treats, in twenty brief sections, of the fundamental
   doctrines on God, the Trinity, the two natures in the person of Christ,
   his work, the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of the
   body. The doctrine of the Trinity is thus stated: 'We believe that
   there are in the one God three peculiarities (?diomata tria), which are
   the principles and fountains of all his other peculiarities . . . and
   these three peculiarities we call the three subsistences (hupostaeis).
   . . . We believe that out of the nature (ek tes phuseos) of God spring
   the Word (logos) and the Spirit (pneuma), as from the fire the light
   and the heat (hosper apo tou puros phos kai therme). . . . These three,
   the Mind, the Word, and the Spirit (nous, logos, pneuma), are one God,
   as in the one soul of man there is the mind (nous), the rational word
   (logos noetos), and the rational will (thelesis noete); and yet these
   three are as to essence but one soul (mia psuche kata ten ousian).'
   [98] The difference of the Greek and Latin doctrine on the procession
   of the Holy Spirit is not touched in this Confession. The relation of
   the divine and human nature in Christ is illustrated by the relation of
   the soul and the body in man, both being distinct, and yet inseparably
   united in one person.

   At the end (§ 14-20) are added, for the benefit of the Turks, seven
   arguments for the truth of the Christian religion, viz.: [99]

   1. The concurrence of Jewish prophecies and heathen oracles in the
   pre-announcement of a Saviour.

   2. The internal harmony and mutual agreement of the different parts of
   the Scriptures.

   3. The acceptance of the gospel by the greatest and best men among all
   nations.

   4. The spiritual character and tendency of the Christian faith, aiming
   at divine and eternal ends.

   5. The ennobling effect of Christ's religion on the morals of his
   followers.

   6. The harmony of revealed truth with sound reason, and the refutation
   of all objections which have been raised against it.

   7. The victory of the Church over persecution and its
   indestructibility.

   The other Confession, ascribed to Gennadius, and generally published
   with the first, is written in the form of a Dialogue ('Sermocinatio')
   between the Sultan and the Patriarch, and entitled 'The Way of Life.'
   [100] The Sultan is represented as asking a number of short questions,
   such as: 'What is God?' 'Why is he called God (theos)' 'How many Gods
   are there?' 'How, if there is but one God, can you speak of three
   Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?' 'Why is the Father called
   Father?' 'Why is the Son called Son?' 'Why is the Holy Spirit called
   Spirit?' To these the Patriarch replies at some length, dwelling mainly
   on the doctrine of the Trinity, and illustrating it by the analogy of
   the sun, light, and heat, and by the trinity of the human mind.

   But there is no external evidence for the authorship of Gennadius; and
   the internal evidence is against it. There was no need of two
   Confessions for the same occasion. There is nothing characteristic of a
   Mohammedan in the questions of the Sultan. The text is more loose and
   prolix in style than the genuine Confession; it contains some absurd
   etymologies unworthy of Gennadius; [101] and it expressly teaches the
   Latin doctrine of the double procession of the Holy Spirit. [102] For
   these reasons, we must either deny the authorship of Gennadius, or the
   integrity of the received text. [103] At all events, it can not be
   regarded in its present form even as a secondary standard of Greek
   orthodoxy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] See, on the transactions of this Council, Mansi, Tom. XXXI., and
   Werner: Geschichte der apologetischen and polemischen Literatur, Vol.
   III. pp. 57 sqq.

   [94] Karyophilus, Allatius, and Kimmel deny the identity of the two
   persons; Robert Creygthon, Renaudot (1704), Richard Simon, Spanheim,
   and Gass defend it. Spanheim, however, regards the unionistic writings
   as interpolations. Allatius and Kimmel maintain that Gennadius
   continued friendly to the union as Patriarch, but Karyophilus supposes
   that the unionistic Scholarius died before the conquest of
   Constantinople, and never was Patriarch. See Kimmel, Monumenta, etc.,
   Prolegomena, p. vi.; Gass, l.c. Vol. I. pp. 5 sqq., and Werner, l.c.
   Vol. III. pp. 67 sqq. Scholarius was a fertile writer of homilies,
   hymns, philosophical and theological essays. Four of these are edited
   in Greek by W. Gass, viz., his Confession, the Dialogue De via salutis,
   the book Contra Automatistas et Hellenistas, and the book De
   providentia et prædestinatione (l.c. Vol. II. pp. 3-146).

   [95] An account of the interview is given in the Historia patriarcharum
   qui sederunt in hac magna catholicaque ecclesia Constantinopolitanensi
   postquam cepit eam Sultanus Mechemeta, written in modern Greek by
   Emmanuel Malaxas, a Peloponnesian, and sent by him to Prof. M. Crusius,
   in Tübingen, who translated and published it in his Turco-Græcia, 1584.
   Crusius and Chytræus were prominent in a fruitless effort to convert
   the Greek Church to Lutheranism.

   [96] Kimmel calls it the second Confession, counting the Dialogue
   (which is of questionable authenticity; see below) as the first. But
   Gass more appropriately prints the Confession first, and the Dialogue
   afterwards, under its own proper title, De Via Salutis.

   [97] The title of the Vienna MS. as published by Otto is: Tou
   aidesimotatou patriarchou Konstantinoupoleos | GENNADIOU SChOLARIOU |
   Biblion peri tinon kephalaion tes hemeteras | pisteos. The title as
   given by Gass from a MS. in Munich reads: Tou agiotatou kai patriarchou
   kai philosophou | GENNADIOU | homilia peri tes orthes kai alethous |
   pisteos ton Christianon. In other titles it is called homlogia or
   homologesis. This Confession (together with the Dialogue on the Way of
   Life) was first published in Greek at Vienna by Prof. John Alex.
   Brassicanus (Kohlburger), in 1530; then in Latin by J. Harold (in his
   Hæresiologia, Basil. 1556, from which it passed into the Patristic
   Libraries, Bibl. P. P. Lugdun. Tom. XXVI. 556, also B. P. P. Colon.
   Tom. XIV. 376, and B. P. P. Par. Tom. IV.); then in Greek and Latin by
   David Chytræus (in his Oratio de statu ecclesiarum hoc tempore in
   Græcia, Asia, Boemia, etc., Frankf. 1583, pp. 173 sqq.); and soon
   afterwards in Greek, Latin, and Turkish by Mart. Crusius of Tübingen
   (in his Turco-Græcia, Basil. 1584, lib. II. 109 sqq.). The text of
   Crusius differs from the preceding editions. He took it from a copy
   sent to him, together with the Sultan's answer, by Emmanuel Malaxas.
   Two other editions of the Greek text were published by J. von Fuchten,
   Helmst. 1611, and by Ch. Daum, Cygneæ (Zwickau), 1677 (Hieronymi
   theologi Græci dialogus de Trinitate, etc.). Kimmel followed the text
   of Chytræus, compared with that of Crusius and the different readings
   in the Bibl. Patr. Lugdun. See his Proleg. p xx. The last and best
   editions of the Greek text of the Confession are by Gass, l.c. II.
   3-15, who used three MSS., and compared older Greek editions and Latin
   versions; and by Otto (1864), who (like Brassicanus) reproduced the
   text of the Vienna Codex after a careful re-examination, and added the
   principal variations of Brassicanus and Gass.

   [98] Compare, on the Trinitarian doctrine of Gennadius and its relation
   to Latin Scholasticism, the exposition of Gass, I. 82 sqq. Kimmel and
   Otto (l.c. p. 400) make him a Platonist, but there are also some
   Aristotelian elements in him.

   [99] This apologetic appendix is omitted in the editions of Brassicanus
   and Fuchten, and is rejected by Otto as a later addition (l.c. pp.
   5-11).

   [100] De Via Salutis. The full title, as given by Gass, l.c. II. 16,
   and Otto, l.c. p. 409, reads:

   Tou aidesimotatou patriarchou Konstantinoupoleos

   GENNADIOU SChOLARIOU

   Biblion suntomon te kai saphes peri tinon kephalaion tes hemeteras
   pisteos, peri on he dialexis gegone meta Amoira tou Machoumetou, ho kai
   epigegraptai

   peri tes odou tes soterias (ton) anthropon.

   The tract was published three times in Greek in the seventeenth
   century--by Brassicanus, Vienna, 1530; by Joh. von Fuchten, Helmstädt,
   1611 (or 1612); and by Daum, Zwickau, 1677; but each of these editions
   is exceedingly rare. The Latin version was repeated in several
   patristic collections, but with more or less omissions or additions
   (occasionally in favor of the Romish system). We have now two correct
   editions of the Greek text, one by Gass (1844), and another by Otto
   (1850; the latter was originally intended for an Appendix to Kimmel's
   collection). Kimmel gives only the Latin version, having been unable to
   obtain the Greek original (Proleg. p. xx.), and seems to confound the
   special title with the joint title for both Confessions; see Bibl. P.
   P. Colon. XIV. 378; Werner. l.c. III. 68. note. The Dialogue has also
   found its way into the writings of Athanasius (Opera, Tom. II. 280.
   Patav. 1777, or II. 335, ed. Paris, 1698), but without a name or an
   allusion to the Sultan, simply as a dialogue between a Christian bishop
   and a catechumen, and with considerable enlargements and adaptations to
   the standard of Greek orthodoxy. Comp. Gass, I. pp. 89 sqq., II. pp.
   16-30, and Otto, p. 407.

   [101] The word theos, is derived from theorein (apo tou theorein ta
   panta hoionei theoros), and also from theein, percurrere (ho gar theos
   aei kai pantachou parestin); pater is derived from terein (apo tou ta
   panta terein), huios from hoios, talis (qualis enim Pater, talis
   Filius), pneuma from noeo, intelligo (panta gar oxeos epinoei).

   [102] In the Latin Version (Kimmel, p. 3): 'Quemadmodum substantia
   solis producit radios, et a sole et radiis procedit lumen: ita Pater
   generat Filium seu Verbum ejus, et a Patre et Filio Procedit Spiritus
   Sanctus.' In the Greek text (Gass, II. 19): Hosper ho diskos ho
   heliakos genna ten aktina, kai para tou heliou kai ton aktinon
   ekporeuetai to phos ; houto ho theos kai pater genna ton huion kai
   logon autou, kai ek tou patros kai huiou ekporeuetai to pneuma to
   hagion. A Greek Patriarch could not have maintained himself with such
   an open avowal of the Latin doctrine. The text of Pseudo-Athanasius
   urges the processio a solo Patre, and removes all other approaches to
   the Latin dogma.

   [103] See Gass, I. p. 100, and Symb. der griech. Kirche, p. 38; Otto,
   p. 405. Both reject the authenticity of the Dialogue.

   Gass: Symbolik d. gr. K. pp. 41 sqq.

   Melanchthon, who had the reunion of Christendom much at heart,
   especially in the later part of his life, first opened a Protestant
   correspondence with the Eastern Church by sending, through the hands of
   a Greek deacon, a Greek translation (made by Paul Dolscius) of the
   Augsburg Confession to Patriarch Joasaph II. of Constantinople, but
   apparently without effect.

   Several years afterwards, from 1573-75, two distinguished professors of
   theology at Tübingen, Jacob Andreæ, one of the authors of the Lutheran
   'Form of Concord' (d. 1590), and Martin Crusius, a rare Greek scholar
   (d. 1607), [104] on occasion of the ordination of Stephen Gerlach for
   the Lutheran chaplaincy of the German legation at the Sublime Porte,
   forwarded to the Patriarch of Constantinople commendatory letters, and
   soon afterwards several copies of the Augsburg Confession in Greek
   (printed at Basle, 1559), together with a translation of some sermons
   of Andreæ, and solicited an official expression of views on the
   Lutheran doctrines, which they thought were in harmony with those of
   the Eastern Church.

   At that time Jeremiah II. was Patriarch of Constantinople (from
   1572-94), a prelate distinguished neither for talent or learning, but
   for piety and misfortune, and for his connection with the Russian
   Church at an important epoch of its history. He was twice arbitrarily
   deposed, saw the old patriarchal church turned into a mosque, and made
   a collecting tour through Russia, where he was received with great
   honor, and induced to confer upon the Metropolitan of Moscow the
   patriarchal dignity over Russia (1589), and thus to lay the foundation
   of the independence of the Russian Church. [105]

   After considerable delay, Jeremiah replied to the Lutheran divines at
   length, in 1576, and subjected the Augsburg Confession to an
   unfavorable criticism, rejecting nearly all its distinctive doctrines,
   and commending only its indorsement of the early oecumenical Synods and
   its view on the marriage of priests. [106] The Tübingen professors sent
   him an elaborate defense (1577), with other documents, but Jeremiah,
   two years afterwards, only reaffirmed his former position, and when the
   Lutherans troubled him with new letters, apologetic and polemic, he
   declined all further correspondence, and ceased to answer. [107]

   The documents of both parties were published at Wittenberg, 1584.

   The Answers of Jeremiah received the approval of the Synod of Jerusalem
   in 1672, [108] and may be regarded, therefore, as truly expressing the
   spirit of the Eastern Communion towards Protestantism. It is evident
   from the transactions of the Synod of Jerusalem that the Greek Church
   rejects Lutheranism and Calvinism alike as dangerous heresies.

   The Anglican Church has since made several attempts to bring about an
   intercommunion with the orthodox East, especially with the Russo-Greek
   Church, during the reign of Peter the Great, and again in our own days,
   but so far without practical effect beyond the exchange of mutual
   courtesies and the expression of a desire for the reunion of orthodox
   Christendom. [109]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [104] He was able to take Andreæ's sermons down in Greek as they were
   delivered in German.

   [105] Mouravieff gives an interesting account of this visit of
   Jeremiah, who styled himself 'by the grace of God, Archbishop of
   Constantinople, which is new Rome, and Patriarch of the whole
   universe.' He made his solemn entry into the Kremlin seated on an ass,
   and presented to the Czar several rich relics, among which are
   mentioned 'a gold Panagia [picture of the Virgin Mary], with morsels of
   the life-giving Cross, of the Robe of the Lord, and of that of the
   Mother of God, incased within it, as well as portions of the
   instruments of our Lord's Passion, the Spear, the Reed, the Sponge, and
   the Crown of Thorns.'

   [106] This third letter of Jeremiah is called Censura Orientalis
   Ecclesiæ, and covers nearly ninety pages folio. His first two letters
   are brief, and do not enter into doctrinal discussions.

   [107] Vitus Myller, in his funeral discourse on Crusius, complains of
   the Greeks as being prouder and more superstitious than the Papists
   (pontificiis longe magis superstitiosi). Crusius edited also a Greek
   translation of four volumes of Lutheran sermons (Corona anni, stephanos
   tou eniautou, Wittemb. 1603) for the benefit of the Greek people, but
   with no better success.

   Next in chronological order comes the Confession of Metrophanes
   Critopulus, once Patriarch of Alexandria, which was written in 1625,
   though not published till 1661.

   Metrophanes Critopulus was a native of Beroea, in Macedonia, and
   educated at Mount Athos. Cyril Lucar, then Patriarch of Alexandria,
   sent him to England, Germany, and Switzerland (1616), with a
   recommendation to the Archbishop of Canterbury (George Abbot), that he
   might be thoroughly educated to counteract, in behalf of the Greek
   Church, the intrigues of the Jesuits. [110] The Archbishop kindly
   received him, and, with the consent of King James I., secured him a
   place in one of the colleges of Oxford. In 1620 Metrophanes visited the
   Universities of Wittenberg, Tübingen, Altdorf, Strasburg, and
   Helmstädt. He acquired good testimonials for his learning and
   character. He entered into close relations with Calixtus and a few
   like-minded Lutheran divines, who dissented from the exclusive
   confessionalism and scholastic dogmatism of the seventeenth century,
   and labored for Catholic union on the basis of the primitive creeds. At
   their request Metrophanes prepared a work on the faith and worship of
   the orthodox Greek Church. He also wrote a number of philological
   essays. After spending some time in Venice as teacher of the Greek
   language, he returned to the East, and became successor of Cyril Lucar
   in Alexandria. But he disappointed the hopes of his patron, and, as a
   member of the Synod of Constantinople, 1638, he even took part in his
   condemnation. The year of his death is unknown.

   The Confession of Metrophanes [111] discusses, in twenty-three
   chapters, all the leading doctrines and usages of the Eastern Church.
   It is a lengthy theological treatise rather than a Confession of faith.
   It has never received ecclesiastical sanction, and is ignored by the
   Synod of Jerusalem; hence it ought not to be quoted as an authority, as
   is done by Winer and other writers on Symbolics. Nevertheless, as a
   private exposition of the Greek faith, it is of considerable interest.

   Although orthodox in the main, it yet presents the more liberal and
   progressive aspect of Eastern theology. It was intended to give a
   truthful account of the Greek faith, but betrays the influence of the
   Protestant atmosphere in which it was composed. It is strongly opposed
   to Romanism, but abstains from all direct opposition to Protestantism,
   and is even respectfully dedicated to the Lutheran theological faculty
   of Helmstädt, where it was written. [112] In this respect it is the
   counterpart or complement of the Confession of Dositheus, which, in its
   zeal against Protestantism, almost ignores the difference from
   Romanism. [113] Thus Metrophanes excludes the Apocrypha from the canon,
   denies in name (though maintaining in substance) the doctrine of
   purgatory, and makes a distinction between sacraments proper, viz.,
   baptism, eucharist, and penance, and a secondary category of
   sacramental or mystical rites, viz., confirmation (or chrisma),
   ordination, marriage, and unction.

   Church.)

   The Confession of Cyril Lucar was never adopted by any branch or party
   of the Eastern Church, and even repeatedly condemned as heretical; but
   as it gave rise to the later authentic definitions of the 'Orthodox
   Faith,' in opposition to the distinctive doctrines of Romanism and
   Protestantism, it must be noticed here.

   Cyrillus Lucaris (Kyrillos Loukaris [114] ), a martyr of Protestantism
   within the orthodox Greek Church, occupies a remarkable position in the
   conflict of the three great Confessions to which the Reformation gave
   rise. He is the counterpart of his more learned and successful, but
   less noble, antagonist, Leo Allatius (1586-1669), who openly
   apostatized from the Greek Church to the Roman, and became librarian of
   the Vatican. His work is a mere episode, and passed away apparently
   without permanent effect, but (like the attempted reformations of
   Wyclif, Huss, and Savonarola) it may have a prophetic meaning for the
   future, and be resumed by Providence in a better form.

   Cyril Lucar was born in 1568 or 1572 in Candia (Crete), then under the
   sovereignty of Venice, and the only remaining seat of Greek learning.
   He studied and traveled extensively in Europe, and was for a while
   rector and Greek teacher in the Russian Seminary at Ostrog, in
   Volhynia. In French Switzerland he became acquainted with the Reformed
   Church, and embraced its faith. Subsequently he openly professed it in
   a letter to the Professors of Geneva (1636), through Leger, a minister
   from Geneva, who had been sent to Constantinople. He conceived the bold
   plan of ingrafting Protestant doctrines on the old oecumenical creeds
   of the Eastern Church, and thereby reforming the same. He was
   unanimously elected Patriarch of Alexandria in 1602 (?), and of
   Constantinople in 1621. While occupying these high positions he carried
   on an extensive correspondence with Protestant divines in Switzerland,
   Holland, and England, sent promising youths to Protestant universities,
   and imported a press from England (1629) to print his Confession and
   several Catechisms. But he stood on dangerous ground, between
   vacillating or ill-informed friends and determined foes. The Jesuits,
   with the aid of the French embassador at the Sublime Porte, spared no
   intrigues to counteract and checkmate his Protestant schemes, and to
   bring about instead a union of the Greek hierarchy with Rome. At their
   instigation his printing-press was destroyed by the Turkish government.
   He himself--in this respect another Athanasius 'versus mundum,' though
   not to be compared in intellectual power to the 'father of
   orthodoxy'--was five times deposed, and five times reinstated. At last,
   however--unlike Athanasius, who died in peaceful possession of his
   patriarchal dignity--he was strangled to death in 1638, having been
   condemned by the Sultan for alleged high-treason, and his body was
   thrown into the Bosphorus. His friends surrounded the palace of his
   successor, Cyril of Beroea, crying, 'Pilate, give us the dead, that we
   may bury him.' [115] The corpse was washed ashore, but it was only
   obtained by Cyril's adherents after having been once more cast out and
   returned by the tide. The next Patriarch, Parthenius, granted him
   finally an honorable burial.

   Cyril left no followers able or willing to carry on his work, but the
   agitation he had produced continued for several years, and called forth
   defensive measures. His doctrines were anathematized by Patriarch Cyril
   of Beroea and a Synod of Constantinople (Sept., 1638), [116] then again
   by the Synods of Jassy, in Moldavia, 1643, and of Jerusalem, 1672; but
   on the last two occasions the honor of his name and the patriarchal
   dignity were saved by boldly denying the authenticity of his
   Confession, and contradicting it by written documents from his pen.
   [117]

   This Cyril was the same who seat the famous uncial Codex Alexandrinus
   of the Bible (A) to King Charles I. of England, [118] and who
   translated the New Testament into the modern Greek language. [119]

   The Confession of Cyril was first written by him in Latin, 1629, and
   then in Greek, with an addition of four questions and answers, 1631,
   and published in both languages at Geneva, 1633. [120] It expresses his
   own individual faith, which he vainly hoped would become the faith of
   the Greek Church. It is divided into eighteen brief chapters, each
   fortified with Scripture references; eight chapters contain the common
   old Catholic doctrine, while the rest bear a distinctly Protestant
   character.

   In Chapter I. the dogma of the Trinity is plainly stated in agreement
   with the oecumenical creeds, the procession of the Spirit in the
   conciliatory terms of the Council of Florence. [121] Chapters IV. and
   V. treat of the doctrines of creation and divine government; Chapter
   VI., of the fall of man; Chapters VII. and VIII., of the twofold state
   of Christ, his incarnation and humiliation, and his exaltation and
   sitting on the right hand of the Father, as the Mediator of mankind and
   the Ruler of his Church (status exinanitionis and st. exaltationis);
   Chapter IX., of faith in general; Chapter XVI., of baptismal
   regeneration.

   The remaining ten chapters breathe the Reformed spirit. Chapter II.
   asserts that 'the authority of the Scriptures is superior to the
   authority of the Church,' since the Scriptures alone, being divinely
   inspired, can not err. [122] In the appendix to the second (the Greek)
   edition, Cyril commends the general circulation of the Scriptures, and
   maintains their perspicuity in matters of faith, but excludes the
   Apocrypha, and rejects the worship of images. He believes 'that the
   Church is sanctified and taught by the Holy Spirit in the way of life,'
   but denies its infallibility, saying: 'The Church is liable to sin
   (hamartanein), and to choose the error instead of the truth (anti tes
   aletheias to pseudos eklegesthai); from such error we can only be
   delivered by the teaching and the light of the Holy Spirit, and not of
   any mortal man' (Ch. XII.). The doctrine of justification (Chapter
   XIII.) is stated as follows:

   'We believe that man is justified by faith, not by works. But when we
   say "by faith," we understand the correlative of faith, viz., the
   Righteousness of Christ, which faith, fulfilling the office of the
   hand, apprehends and applies to us for salvation. And this we
   understand to be fully consistent with, and in no wise to the prejudice
   of, works; for the truth itself teaches us that works also are not to
   be neglected, and that they are necessary means and testimonies of our
   faith, and a confirmation of our calling. But, as human frailty bears
   witness, they are of themselves by no means sufficient to save man, and
   able to appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, so as to merit the
   reward of salvation. The righteousness of Christ, applied to the
   penitent, alone justifies and saves the believer.'

   The freedom of will before regeneration is denied (Ch. XIV.). [123] In
   the doctrine of decrees, Cyril agrees with the Calvinistic system (Ch.
   III.), and thereby offended Grotius and the Arminians. He accepts, with
   the Protestants, only two sacraments as being instituted by Christ,
   instead of seven, and requires faith as a condition of their
   application (Ch. XV.). He rejects the dogma of transubstantiation and
   oral manducation, and teaches the Calvinistic theory of a real but
   spiritual presence and fruition of the body and blood of Christ by
   believers only (Ch. XVII.). In the last chapter he rejects the doctrine
   of purgatory and of the possibility of repentance after death.

   [116] Cyril of Beroea seemed to assume the authenticity of Cyril's
   Confession. He was, however, himself afterwards deposed and
   anathematized on the charge of extortion and embezzlement of
   ecclesiastical funds, and for the part he took in procuring the death
   of Cyril Lucar by preferring false accusation against him to the Turks.
   See Mouravieff, Hist. of the Church of Russia, translated by Blackmore,
   p. 396. Blackmore, however, gives there a wrong date, assigning the
   death of Cyril to 1628 instead of 1638.

   [117] The Synods of Jassy and Jerusalem intimate that Cyril's
   Confession was a Calvinistic forgery, and the Synod of Jerusalem quotes
   largely from his homilies to prove his orthodoxy. Mouravieff, l.c. p.
   189, adopts a middle view, saying: 'Cyril, although he had condemned
   the new doctrine of Calvin, nevertheless had not stood up decidedly and
   openly to oppose it, and for his neglect he was himself delivered over
   to an anathema by his successor, Cyril of Beroea.'

   state. Cyril brought the Codex with him from Alexandria, or, according
   to another report, from Mount Athos, and sent it to England in 1628,
   where it passed from the king's library into the British Museum, 1753.
   It dates from the fifth century, and contains the Septuagint Version of
   the Old Testament, the whole New Testament, with some chasms, and, as
   an Appendix, the only MS. copy extant of the first Epistle of Clemens
   Romanus to the Corinthians, with a fragment of a second Epistle. The
   New Test. has been edited in quasi-fac-simile, by Woide, Lond. 1786,

   at both places; the authorities I have consulted differ. The
   subscription to the Græco-Latin edition before me reads: 'Datum
   Constantinopoli mense Januario 1631 Cyrillus Patriarcha
   Constantinopoleos.' Another edition (perhaps by Hugo Grotius) was
   published 1645, without indication of place (perhaps at Amsterdam). I
   have used Kimmel's edition, which gives the text of the edition of
   1645.

   § 16. The Orthodox Confession of Mogilas, A.D. 1643.

   The Orthodox Confession of the Catholic and Apostolic Eastern Church
   [124] was originally drawn up about the year 1640 by Peter Mogilas (or
   Mogila), Metropolitan of Kieff, and father of Russian theology (died
   1647), in the form of a Catechism for the benefit of the Russian
   Church. [125] It was revised and adopted by a Provincial Synod at Kieff
   for Russia, then again corrected and purged by a Synod of the Greek and
   Russian clergy at Jassy, in 1643, where it received its present shape
   by Meletius Syriga, or Striga, the Metropolitan of Nicæa, and exarch of
   the Patriarch of Constantinople. As thus improved, it was sent to, and
   signed by, the four Eastern Patriarchs. The Synod of Jerusalem gave it
   a new sanction in 1672 (declaring it a homologia, hen edexato kai
   dechetai hapaxaplos pasa he anatolike ekklesia). In this way it became
   the Creed of the entire Greek and Russian Church. It has been the basis
   of several later Catechisms prepared by Russian divines.

   The Orthodox Confession was a defensive measure against Romanism and
   Protestantism. It is directed, first, against the Jesuits who, under
   the protection of the French embassadors in Constantinople, labored to
   reconcile the Greek Church with the Pope; and, secondly, against the
   Calvinistic movement, headed by Cyril Lucar, and continued after his
   death. [126]

   It is preceded by a historical account of its composition and
   publication, a pastoral letter of Nectarius, Patriarch of Jerusalem,
   dated Nov. 20, 1662; and by a letter of indorsement of the Greek text
   from Parthenius, Patriarch of Constantinople, dated March 11, 1643,
   [127] followed by the signatures of twenty-six Patriarchs and prelates
   of the Eastern Church.

   The letter of Parthenius is as follows:

   'Parthenius, by the mercy of God, Archbishop of Constantinople, New
   Rome, and OEcumenical Patriarch. Our mediocrity, [128] together with
   our sacred congregation of chief bishops and clergy present, has
   diligently perused a small book, transmitted to us from our true
   sister, the Church of Lesser Russia, entitled "The Confession of the
   Orthodox Faith of the Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ," in
   which the whole subject is treated under the three heads of Faith,
   Love, and Hope, in such a manner that Faith is divided into twelve
   articles, to wit, those of the sacred [Nicene] Symbol; Love into the
   Ten Commandments, and such other necessary precepts as are contained in
   the sacred and divinely inspired books of the Old and New Testaments;
   Hope into the Lord's Prayer and the nine Beatitudes of the holy Gospel.

   'We have found that this book follows faithfully the dogmas of the
   Church of Christ, and agrees with the sacred canons, and in no respect
   differs from them. As to the other part of the book, that which is in
   the Latin tongue, on the side opposite to the Greek text, we have not
   perused it, so that we only formally confirm that which is in our
   vernacular tongue. With our common synodical sentence, we decree, and
   we announce to every pious and orthodox Christian subject to the
   Eastern and Apostolic Church, that this book is to be diligently read,
   and not to be rejected. Which, for the perpetual faith and certainty of
   the fact, we guard by our subscriptions. In the year of salvation 1643,
   11th day of March.'

   The Confession itself begins with three preliminary questions and
   answers. Question first: 'What must an orthodox and Catholic Christian
   man observe in order to inherit eternal life?' Answer: 'Right faith and
   good works (pistin orthen kai erga kala); for he who observes these is
   a good Christian, and has the hope of eternal salvation, according to
   the sacred Scriptures (James ii. 24): "Ye see, then, how that by works
   a man is justified, and not by faith only;" and a little after (v. 26):
   "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
   dead also." The divine Paul adds the same in another place (1 Tim. i.
   19): "Holding faith and a good conscience; which some having put away,
   concerning faith have made shipwreck;" and, in another place, he says
   (1 Tim. iii. 9): "Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure
   conscience."' This is essentially the same with the Roman Catholic
   doctrine. It is characteristic that no passage is cited from the Romans
   and Galatians, which are the bulwark of the evangelical Protestant view
   of justification by faith. The second Question teaches that faith must
   precede works, because it is impossible to please God without faith
   (Heb. xi. 6). The third Question treats of the division of the
   Catechism according to the three theological virtues, faith, hope, and
   charity.

   The Catechism is therefore divided into three parts.

   1. Part first treats of Faith (peri pisteos), and explains the Nicene
   Creed, which is divided into twelve articles, and declared to contain
   all things pertaining to our faith so accurately 'that we should
   believe nothing more and nothing less, nor in any other sense than that
   in which the fathers [of the Councils of Nicæa and Constantinople]
   understood it' (Qu. 5). The clause Filioque is, of course, rejected as
   an unwarranted Latin interpolation and corruption (Qu. 72).

   2. Part second treats of Hope (peri elpidos), and contains an
   exposition of the Lord's Prayer and the (nine) Beatitudes (Matt. v.
   3-11).

   3. Part third treats of Love to God and man (peri tes eis theon kai ton
   plesion agapes), and gives an exposition of the Decalogue; but this is
   preceded by forty-five questions on the three cardinal virtues of
   prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, and the four general virtues which
   flow out of them (prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance), on
   mortal and venial sins, on the seven general mortal sins (pride,
   avarice, fornication, envy, gluttony, desire of revenge, and sloth), on
   the sins against the Holy Ghost (presumption or temerity, despair,
   persistent opposition to the truth, and renouncing of the Christian
   faith), and on venial sins. In the division of the Ten Commandments the
   Greek Confession agrees with the Reformed Church in opposition to the
   Roman and Lutheran Churches, which follow the less natural division of
   Augustine by merging the second commandment in the first, and then
   dividing the tenth.

   Russ. First published in Greek by Panagiotta, Amst. 1662; then in Greek

   Leipz. 1695; in Greek, Latin, and German by C. G. Hofmann, Breslau,

   of Nectarius and Parthenius). Comp. Kimmel's Proleg. pp. lxii. sqq. The
   Confession must not be confounded with the Short Russian Catechism by
   the same author (Peter Mogilas).

   [125] The following account of Mogilas is translated from the Russian
   of Bolchofsky by Blackmore (The Doctrine of the Russian Church, p.
   xviii.): 'Peter Mogila belonged by birth to the family of the Princes
   of Moldavia, and before he became an ecclesiastic had distinguished
   himself as a soldier. After having embraced the monastic life, he
   became first Archimandrite of the Pechersky, and subsequently, in 1632,
   Metropolitan of Kieff, to which dignity he was ordained by authority of
   Cyril Lucar [then Patriarch of Constantinople], with the title of
   Eparch, or Exarch of the Patriarchal See. He sat about fifteen years,
   and died in 1647. Besides the Orthodox Confession, he put out, in 1645,
   in the dialect of Little Russia, his Short Catechism; composed a
   Preface prefixed to the Patericon; corrected, in 1646, from Greek and
   Slavonic MSS., the Trebnik, or Office-book, and added to each Office
   doctrinal, casuistical, and ceremonial instructions. He also caused
   translations to be made from the Greek Lives of the Saints, by
   Metaphrastus, though this work remained unfinished at his death; and,
   lastly, he composed a Short Russian Chronicle, which is preserved in
   MS., but has never yet been printed. He was the founder of the first
   Russian Academy at Kieff.' It was called, after him, the Kievo-Mogilian
   Academy. He also founded a library and a printing-press. See a fuller
   account of Peter Mogilas in Mouravieff's History of the Church of
   Russia, translated by Blackmore (Oxford, 1842), pp. 186-189. It is
   there stated that he received his education in the University of Paris.
   This accounts for the tinge of Latin scholasticism in his Confession.

   [126] See § 15. Mouravieff, in his Hist. of the Church of Russia, p.
   188, distinctly asserts that the Confession was directed both against
   the Jesuits and against 'the Calvinistic heresy,' which, 'under the
   name of Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of Constantinople,' had been
   disseminated in the East by 'crafty teachers.' As Cyril and the
   Calvinists are not mentioned by name in the Orthodox Confession,
   another Russian writer, quoted by Blackmore (The Doctrine of the
   Russian Church, p. xx.), thinks that Mogilas wrote against the
   Lutherans rather than the Calvinists; adding, however, that it is
   chiefly directed against the Papists, from whom danger was most
   apprehended.

   [127] This is the date (achmg') given by Kimmel, P. I. p. 53, and the
   date of the Synod of Jassy, where the Confession was adopted. Butler
   (Hist. Acc. of Conf. of Faith, p. 101) gives the year 1663; but the
   Confession was already published in 1662 with the letters of the two
   Patriarchs. See Kimmel, Proleg. p. lxii.

   'servus servorum Dei,' which dates from Gregory I.

   The Synod convened at Jerusalem in March, 1672, by Patriarch Dositheus,
   for the consecration of the restored Church of the Holy Nativity in
   Bethlehem, [129] issued a new Defense or Apology of Greek Orthodoxy. It
   is directed against Calvinism, which was still professed or secretly
   held by many admirers of Cyril Lucar. It is dated Jerusalem, March 16,
   1672, and signed by Dositheus, Patriarch of Jerusalem and Palestine
   (otherwise little known), and by sixty-eight Eastern bishops and
   ecclesiastics, including some from Russia. [130]

   This Synod is the most important in the modern history of the Eastern
   Church, and may be compared to the Council of Trent. Both fixed the
   doctrinal status of the Churches they represent, and both condemned the
   evangelical doctrines of Protestantism. Both were equally hierarchical
   and intolerant, and present a strange contrast to the first Synod held
   in Jerusalem, when 'the apostles and elders,' in the presence of 'the
   brethren,' freely discussed and adjusted, in a spirit of love, without
   anathemas, the great controversy between the Gentile and the Jewish
   Christians. The Synod of Jerusalem has been charged by Aymon and others
   with subserviency to the interests of Rome; Dositheus being in
   correspondence with Nointel, the French embassador at Constantinople.
   The Synod was held at a time when the Romanists and Calvinists in
   France fiercely disputed about the Eucharist, and were anxious to
   secure the support of the Greek Church. But although the Synod was
   chiefly aimed against Protestantism, and has no direct polemical
   reference to the Latin Church, it did not give up any of the
   distinctive Greek doctrines, or make any concessions to the claims of
   the Papacy.

   The acts of the Synod of Jerusalem consist of six chapters, and a
   confession of Dositheus in eighteen decrees. Both are preceded by a
   pastoral letter giving an account of the occasion of this public
   confession in opposition to Calvinism and Lutheranism, which are
   condemned alike as being essentially the same heresy, notwithstanding
   some apparent differences. [131] The Answers of Patriarch Jeremiah
   given to Martin Crusius, Professor in Tübingen, and other Lutherans, in
   1572, are approved by the Synod of Jerusalem, as they were by the Synod
   of Jassy, and thus clothed with a semi-symbolical authority. The
   Orthodox Confession of Peter Mogilas is likewise sanctioned again, but
   the Confession of Cyril Lucar is disowned as a forgery.

   The Six Chapters are very prolix, and altogether polemical against the
   Confession which was circulated under the name of Cyril Lucar, and give
   large extracts from his homilies preached before the clergy and people
   of Constantinople to prove his orthodoxy. One anathema is not
   considered sufficient, and a threefold anathema is hurled against the
   heretical doctrines.

   The Confessio Dosithei presents, in eighteen decrees or articles, [132]
   a positive statement of the orthodox faith. It follows the order of
   Cyril's Confession, which it is intended to refute. It is the most
   authoritative and complete doctrinal deliverance of the modern Greek
   Church on the controverted articles. It was formally transmitted by the
   Eastern Patriarchs to the Russian Church in 1721, and through it to
   certain Bishops of the Church of England, as an ultimatum to be
   received without further question or conference by all who would be in
   communion with the Orthodox Church. The eighteen decrees were also
   published in a Russian version (1838), but with a number of omissions
   and qualifications, [133] showing that, after all, the Russian branch
   of the Greek Church reserves to itself a certain freedom of further
   theological development. We give them here in a condensed summary from
   the original Greek:

   Article I.--The doctrine of the Holy Trinity, with the single
   procession of the Spirit. (Pneuma hagion ek tou patros ekporeuomenon.
   Against the Latins.)

   Article II.--The Holy Scriptures must be interpreted, not by private
   judgment, but in accordance with the tradition of the Catholic Church,
   which can not err, or deceive, or be deceived, and is of equal
   authority with the Scriptures. (Essentially Romish, but without an
   infallible, visible head of the Church.)

   Article III.--God has from eternity predestinated to glory those who
   would, in his foreknowledge, make good use of their free will in
   accepting the salvation, and has condemned those who would reject it.
   The Calvinistic doctrine of unconditional predestination is condemned
   as abominable, impious, and blasphemous.

   Article IV.--The doctrine of creation. The triune God made all things,
   visible and invisible, except sin, which is contrary to his will, and
   originated in the Devil and in man.

   Article V.--The doctrine of Providence. God foresees and permits (but
   does not foreordain) evil, and overrules it for good.

   Article VI.--The primitive state and fall of man. Christ and the Virgin
   Mary are exempt from sin.

   Article VII.--The doctrine of the incarnation of the Son of God, his
   death, resurrection, ascension, and return to judgment.

   Article VIII.--The work of Christ. He is the only Mediator and Advocate
   for our sins; but the saints, and especially the immaculate Mother of
   our Lord, as also the holy angels, bring our prayers and petitions
   before him, and give them greater effect.

   Article IX.--No one can be saved without faith, which is a certain
   persuasion, and works by love (i.e. the observance of the divine
   commandments). It justifies before Christ, and without it no one can
   please God.

   Article X.--The holy Catholic and Apostolic Church comprehends all true
   believers in Christ, and is governed by Christ, the only head, through
   duly ordained bishops in unbroken succession. The doctrine of
   Calvinists, that bishops are not necessary, or that priests
   (presbyters) may be ordained by priests, and not by bishops only, is
   rejected.

   Article XI.--Members of the Catholic Church are all the faithful, who
   firmly hold the faith of Christ as delivered by him, the apostles, and
   the holy synods, although some of them may be subject to various sins.

   Article XII.--The Catholic Church is taught by the Holy Ghost, through
   prophets, apostles, holy fathers, and synods, and therefore can not
   err, or be deceived, or choose a lie for the truth. (Against Cyril;
   comp. Art. II.)

   Article XIII.--Man is justified, not by faith alone, but also by works.

   Article XIV.--Man has been debilitated by the fall, and lost the
   perfection and freedom from suffering, but not his intellectual and
   moral nature. He has still the free will (to autexousion) or the power
   to choose and do good or to flee and hate evil (Matt. v. 46, 47; Rom.
   i. 19; ii. 14, 15). But good works done without faith can not
   contribute to our salvation; only the works of the regenerate, done
   under grace and with grace, are perfect, and render the one who does
   them worthy of salvation (soterias axion poieitai ton energounta).

   Article XV.--Teaches, with the Roman Church, the seven sacraments or
   mysteries (musteria), viz., baptism (to hagion baptisma, Matt. xxviii.
   19), confirmation (bebaiosis or chrisma, Luke xxiv. 49; 2 Cor. i. 21;
   and Dionysius Areop.), ordination (hierosune, Matt. xviii. 18), the
   unbloody sacrifice of the altar (he anaimaktos thusia, Matt. xxvi. 26,
   etc.), matrimony (gamos, Matt. xix. 6; Eph. v. 32), penance and
   confession (metanoia kai exomologesis, John xx. 23; Luke xiii. 3, 5),
   and holy unction (to hagion elaion or euchelaion, Mark vi. 13; James v.
   14). Sacraments are not empty signs of divine promises (as
   circumcision), but they necessarily (ex anankes) confer grace (as
   organa drastika charitos).

   Article XVI.--Teaches the necessity of baptism for salvation, baptismal
   regeneration (John iii. 5), infant baptism, and the salvation of
   baptized infants (Matt. xix. 12). The effect of baptism is the
   remission of hereditary and previous actual sin, and the gift of the
   Holy Spirit. It can not be repeated; sins committed after baptism must
   be forgiven by priestly absolution on repentance and confession.

   Article XVII.--The Eucharist is both a sacrament and a sacrifice, in
   which the very body and blood of Christ are truly and really (alethos
   kai pragmatikos) present under the figure and type (en eidei kai tupo)
   of bread and wine, are offered to God by the hands of the priest as a
   real though unbloody sacrifice for all the faithful, whether living or
   dead (huper panton ton eusebon zonton kai tethneoton), and are received
   by the hand and the mouth of unworthy as well as worthy communicants,
   though with opposite effects. The Lutheran doctrine is rejected, and
   the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation (metabole, metousiosis) is
   taught as strongly as words can make it; [134] but it is disclaimed to
   give an explanation of the mode in which this mysterious and miraculous
   change of the elements takes place. [135]

   Article XVIII.--The souls of the departed are either at rest or in
   torment, [136] according to their conduct in life; but their condition
   will not be perfect till the resurrection of the body. The souls of
   those who die in a state of penitence (metanoesantes), without having
   brought forth fruits of repentance, or satisfactions (hikanopoiesis),
   depart into Hades (aperchesthai eis adou), and there they must suffer
   the punishment for their sins; but they may be delivered by the prayers
   of the priests and the alms of their kindred, especially by the
   unbloody sacrifice of the mass (magala dunamenes malista tes anaimaktou
   thusias), which individuals offer for their departed relatives, and
   which the Catholic and Apostolic Church daily offers for all alike. The
   liberation from this intervening state of purification will take place
   before the resurrection and the general judgment, but the time is
   unknown.

   This is essentially the Romish doctrine of purgatory, although the term
   is avoided, and nothing is said of material or physical torments. [137]

   To these eighteen decrees are added four questions and answers, with
   polemic reference to the similar questions at the close of the enlarged
   edition of Cyril's Confession. [138] The first question discourages and
   even prohibits the general and indiscriminate reading of the Holy
   Scriptures, especially certain portions of the Old Testament. The
   second denies the perspicuity of the Scriptures. The third defines the
   extent of the canon including the Apocrypha. [139] The fourth teaches
   the worship of saints, especially the Mother of God (who is the object
   of hyperdulia, as distinct from the ordinary dulia of saints, and the
   latria or worship proper due to God), as also the worshipful veneration
   of the cross, the holy Gospels, the holy vessels, the holy places,
   [140] and of the images of Christ and of the saints. [141]

   In all these important points the Synod of Jerusalem again essentially
   agrees with the Church of Rome, and radically dissents from
   Protestantism.

   [129] Hence it is sometimes called the Synod of Bethlehem, but it was
   actually held at Jerusalem.

   the Greeks first adopted in this period the doctrine of
   transubstantiation, but Kiesling (Hist. concertat. Græcorum
   Latinorumque de transsubstantiatione, pp. 354-480, as quoted by
   Tzschirner, in Vol. IX. of his continuation of Schroeckh's Church Hist.
   since the Reformation, p. l02) has shown that several Greeks taught
   this theory long before or ever since the Council of Florence (1439).
   Yet the opposition to the Calvinistic view of Cyril and his
   sympathizers brought the Greek Church to a clearer and fuller
   expression on this point.

   Transsubstantiationis modum ilium, quo in corpus et sanguinem Domini
   panis et vinum convertantur, explicari minime credimus--id enim penitus
   incomprehensibile,' etc. Metousiosis (not given in the Classical Dict.,
   nor in Sophocles's Byzantine Greek Dict., nor in Suicer's
   Thesaurus)--from the classical ousioo, to call into being (ousia) or
   existence, and the patristic ousiosis, a calling into existence--must
   be equivalent to the Latin transsubstantiatio, or change of the
   elemental substance of bread and wine into the body and blood of
   Christ.

   [136] en anesei, lit. in relaxation, recreation, e en odune, or in
   pain, distress.

   [137] The same doctrine is taught in the Longer Russian Catechism of
   Philaret (on the 11th article of the Nicene Creed). It is often
   asserted (even by Winer, who is generally very accurate, Symb. pp. 158,
   159) that the Greek Church rejects the Romish purgatory. Winer quotes
   the Conf. Metrophanis Critopuli, c. 20; but this has no ecclesiastical
   authority, and, although it rejects the word pur katharterion (ignis
   purgatoris), and all idea of material or physical pain (ten ekeinon
   poinen me huliken einai, eitous organiken, me dia puros, mete di alles
   hules), it asserts, nevertheless, a spiritual pain of conscience in the
   middle state (alla dia thlipseos kai anias tes suneideseos), from which
   the sufferers may be released by prayers and the sacrifice of the
   altar. The Conf. Orthodoxa (P. I. Qu. 66) speaks vaguely of a
   proskairos kolasis kathartike ton psuchon, 'a temporary purifying
   (disciplinary) punishment of the souls.' The Roman Church, on her part,
   does not require belief in a material fire. The Greek Church has no
   such minute geography of the spirit world as the Latin, which, besides
   heaven and hell proper, teaches an intervening region of purgatory for
   imperfect Christians, and two border regions, the Limbus Patrum for the
   saints of the Old Testament now delivered, and the Limbus Infantum for
   unbaptized children; but it differs much more widely from the
   Protestant eschatology, which rejects the idea of a third or middle
   place altogether, and assign all the departed either to a state of
   bliss or a state of misery; allowing, however, different degrees in
   both states corresponding to the different degrees of holiness and
   wickedness.

   [138] Comp. § 15, p. 57.

   [139] The following Apocrypha are expressly mentioned (Vol. I. p. 467):
   The Wisdom of Solomon, Judith, Tobit, History of the Dragon, History of
   Susannah, the books of the Maccabees, the Wisdom of Sirach. The
   Confession of Mogilas, though not formally sanctioning the Apocrypha,
   quotes them frequently as authority, e.g. Tobit xii. 9, in P. III. Qu.
   9, on alms. On the other hand, the less important Confession of
   Metrophanes Critopulus, c. 7 (Kimmel, P. II. p. 104 sq.), mentions only
   twenty-two canonical books of the Old Test., and excludes from them the
   Apocrypha, mentioning Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of
   Sirach, Baruch, and the Maccabees. The Russian Catechism of Philaret
   omits the Apocrypha in enumerating the books of the Old Test., for the
   reason that 'they do not exist in Hebrew,' but adds that 'they have
   been appointed by the fathers to be read by proselytes who are
   preparing for admission into the Church.' (See Vol. II. 451, and
   Blackmore's translation, pp.38, 39.)

   § 18. The Synods of Constantinople, A.D. 1672 and 1691.

   Three months previous to the Synod of Jerusalem a Synod was held at
   Constantinople (January, 1672), which adopted a doctrinal statement
   signed by Dionysius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and forty-three
   dignitaries belonging to his patriarchate. [142] It is less complete
   than the Confession of Dositheus, but agrees with it on all points, as
   the authority and infallibility of the Church, the extent of the canon,
   the seven mysteries (sacraments), the real sacrifice of the altar, and
   the miraculous transformation [143] of the elements.

   Another Synod was held in Constantinople nineteen years afterwards, in
   1691, under Patriarch Callinicus, for the purpose of giving renewed
   sanction to the orthodox doctrine of the Eucharist, in opposition to
   Logothet John Caryophylus, who had rejected the Romish theory of
   transubstantiation, and defended the Calvinistic view of Cyril Lucar.
   The Synod condemned him, and declared that the Eastern Church had
   always taught a change (metabole) of the elements in the sense of a
   transubstantiation (metousiosis), or an actual transformation of their
   essence into the body and blood of Christ. [144]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] It is called Dionysii, Patr. Const., super Calvinistarum
   erroribus ac reali imprimis præsentia responsio, and is published in
   some editions of the Confession of the Synod of Jerusalem; in Harduini
   Acta Conciliorum, Tom. XI. pp. 274-282; and in the second volume of
   Kimmel's Monumenta, pp. 214-227.

   [143] On this the document teaches (Kimmel, P. II. p. 218) that when
   the priest prays, 'Make (poieson) this bread the precious blood of thy
   Christ,' then, by the mysterious and ineffable operation of the Holy
   Ghost, ho men artos metapoieitai (transmutatur) eis auto ekeino to
   idion soma tou soteros Christou pragmatikos kai alethos kai kurios
   (realiter, vere, ac proprie), ho de oinos eis to zoopoion haima autou.

   [144] I have not been able to procure the proceedings of this Synod;
   they are omitted both by Hardouin and Kimmel. They were first printed
   at Jassy, 1698; then in Greek and Latin by Eusebius Renaudot, together
   with some other Greek writings on the Eucharist, Paris, 1709; in German
   by Heineccius, in his Abbildung der alten und neuen Griechischen
   Kirche, 2 Parts, Leipz. 1711. Appendix. p. 40. etc. So says Rud.
   Hofmann (in his Symbolik, Leipz. 1857, p. 135), who has paid careful
   attention to the Greek Church.

   Church of England and the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United
   States, publ. in Lond. (Rivington's), and N. York, since 1864.

   The latest doctrinal standards of Greek Christianity are the authorized
   Catechisms and Church-books of the orthodox Church of Russia, by far
   the most important and hopeful branch of the Eastern Communion.

   Russia received Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Cyril and
   Methodius, two monks of Constantinople, preached the gospel to the
   Bulgarians on the Danube after the middle of the ninth century,
   translated the Scriptures [145] into the Slavonic language (creating
   the Slavonic alphabet in quaint Greek characters), and thus laid the
   foundation of Slavonic literature and civilization. This event was
   contemporary with the founding of the Russian Empire by Ruric, of the
   Norman race (A.D. 862), and succeeded by half a century the founding of
   the German Empire under Charlemagne, in close connection with Rome
   (A.D. 800). As the latter was a substitute for the Western Roman
   Empire, so the former was destined to take the place of the Eastern
   Roman Empire, and looks forward to the reconquest of Constantinople, as
   its natural capital. The barbarous Russians submitted, in the tenth
   century, without resistance, to Christian baptism by immersion, at the
   command of their Grand Duke, Vladimir, who himself was brought over to
   Christianity by a picture on the last judgment, and his marriage to a
   sister of the Greek Emperor Basil. In this wholesale conversion every
   thing is characteristic: the influence of the picture, the effect of
   marriage, the power of the civil ruler, the military command, the
   passive submission of the people.

   Since that time the Greek Church has been the national religion of the
   Slavonic Russians, and identified with all their fortunes and
   misfortunes. For a long time they were subject to the jurisdiction of
   the Patriarch of Constantinople. But after the fall of this city (1453)
   the Metropolitan of Moscow became independent (1461), and a century
   later (January, 1589) he was raised by Patriarch Jeremiah II. of
   Constantinople, then on a collecting tour in Russia, to the dignity of
   a Patriarch of equal rank with the other four (of Constantinople,
   Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem). Moscow was henceforward the holy city,
   the Rome of Russia.

   In the beginning of the eighteenth century, Peter the Great, a second
   Constantine, founded St. Petersburg (1703), made this city the
   political and ecclesiastical capital of his Empire, and created, in the
   place of the Patriarchate of Moscow, the 'Most Holy Governing Synod,'
   with the Czar as the head (1721). This organic change was sanctioned by
   the Eastern Patriarchs (1723), who look upon the emperor-pope of Russia
   as their future deliverer from the intolerable yoke of the Turks.

   [Note.--Since the revolution of 1917 and the assassination of the Czar,
   the position of the Russian Church has undergone a radical change. The
   Soviet government has passed from a law abolishing the union of Church
   and State to a relentless war against all religion and religious
   exercises, the confiscation of Church property, the suppression of
   religious liberty, the imprisonment and execution of clerical
   personages, and even to a policy of active atheistic propaganda.
   Conforming to the new civil order, the Holy Sober--council--met,
   August, 1917, with 564 delegates present, of whom 278 were laymen, and
   constituted Tikhon (1866-1925) Most holy Patriarch of Moscow and all
   Russia, thus re-establishing the patriarchate after an interval of two
   centuries. Tikhon resisted the Soviet acts instituting civil marriage
   and disestablishing the Church, and placed the state officials under
   excommunication. The government replied by further legislation hostile
   to the Church, and Tikhon was put under arrest and resigned the
   patriarchate, 1922. In the mean time a 'reforming' organization,
   calling itself the 'Living Church,' was effected, which acknowledged
   the Soviet revolution and made the 'white clergy'--in contrast to the
   monks--eligible to the episcopal office. The Sober of April, 1924,
   received greetings from Dr. Blake of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   disavowed Tikhon's anti-Soviet deliverances, endorsed the separation of
   Church and State, and granted to widowed and divorced priests the right
   of remarriage. A third Sober affirmed that supreme ecclesiastical
   authority resided in itself and not in the patriarch, a declaration
   accepted by Gregory VII, oecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, other
   Eastern patriarchs dissenting. The Tikhon wing was continued under
   Peter, Metropolitan of Krutitsky, whom Tikhon had designated as his
   successor. Peter was banished for anti-Soviet policies, and his place
   filled by Abp. Sergius, who himself was imprisoned but released, 1927,
   after promising to support the existing civil government. The émigré
   bishops, with Serbia as a rallying-place, have favored the restoration
   of the empire, and June 30, 1930, Sergius deposed Eulogius from the
   post of so-called supreme bishop of the Russian Church outside of
   Russia. Soviet legislation, 1930, confirmed all previous acts
   calculated to blot out religious convictions and ritual. It forbids the
   teaching of religion to persons under eighteen, the organization of
   meetings of women and children for purposes of prayer and biblical and
   literary study or for sewing, the organization under Church influence
   of libraries and reading-rooms, and even measures intended to give
   sanitary and medical assistance. It prohibits the teaching of any form
   of religious belief in educational establishments, and the formation of
   all boys' and girls' clubs in church buildings. Religious teaching is
   treated as "anti-revolutionary activity." The secret propaganda of
   religion among the masses is forbidden, and ministers of religion,
   including rabbis and nuns, who continue to follow their religion are
   disfranchised and made ineligible for public office. Bibles and
   prayer-books are confiscated. Church buildings are put at the State's
   disposal. Articles of gold and silver and precious stones are to be
   given up upon the discontinuance of a house of worship, and places of
   worship having a historic or artistic value pass to the State.
   Processions on festival days are forbidden, as also is the observance
   of Christmas, Easter, and other Church feasts. In addition to such
   laws, the Soviet has carried out its destructive policy by films and
   posters ridiculing and blaspheming Christianity. By governmental order
   or the populace, multitudes of icons have been destroyed and pretended
   bodies of saints dishonored and shown to be made of wax or straw. The
   treatment of the Russian Church and clergy has called forth from the
   pope and the Church of England resolutions against the government's
   policy, and letters of sympathy. Since 1914, friendly gestures have
   been made from Rome calculated to win favor for the Roman Church. In
   1920, Ephraem of Edessa was enrolled among the doctors of the Church.
   The Oriental College in Rome has been enlarged. In 1921, Benedict XV.
   addressed the Russians as 'our distant children who, though separated
   from us by the barriers of centuries, are all the nearer our paternal
   heart, the greater their misfortunes are.' In 1929, Pius XI. issued an
   appeal in Italian for prayer for 'our brethren in Russia,' which spoke
   of  'the sacrilege heaped upon the priests and believers, and the
   violence done to the conscience by the Soviets.' The pontiff appointed
   a solemn mass to be celebrated over St. Peter's tomb, March 19, 1930,
   and called for the help of  'the Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God, her
   most chaste spouse, St. Joseph, patron of the Church universal, John
   Chrysostom and other patron saints of the Russians, and of all saints,
   especially St. Therèse of the Cradle of Jesus, the sweet thaumaturge of
   Lisieux.' In the form of prayer which Pius added for general use, the
   petition was made that the Russians may return 'to the one fold and the
   communion of the Catholic Church,' and an indulgence of 300 days
   offered to all making the prayer piously. Resolutions passed by the
   Convocations Canterbury and York, 1930, called for special prayers in
   the churches at the morning and evening services, March 16.--Ed.]

   We have already seen that the 'Orthodox Confession,' or the first
   systematic and complete exhibition of the modern Greek faith, is the
   product of a Russian prelate, Peter Mogilas of Kieff. It was followed,
   and practically superseded, by other catechisms, which are much better
   adapted to the religious instruction of the young.

   1. The Catechism of Platon, Metropolitan of Moscow (died 1812), one of
   the very few Russian divines whose name is known beyond their native
   land. [146] He was the favorite of the Empress Catherine II. (died
   1796), and, for a time, of her savage son, the Emperor Paul
   (assassinated 1801), and at the end of his life he encouraged the
   Emperor Alexander I. in the terrible year of the French invasion and
   the destruction of Moscow. When the French atheist Diderot began a
   conversation with the sneering remark, 'There is no God,' Platon
   instantly replied, 'The fool says in his heart, There is no God.' He
   was a great preacher and the leader of a somewhat milder type of
   Russian orthodoxy, not disinclined to commune with the outside world.
   His Catechism was originally prepared for his pupil, the Grand Duke
   Paul Petrovitsch, and shows some influence of the evangelical system by
   its tendency to go directly to the Bible.

   2. The Catechism of Philaret, revised, authorized, and published by the
   Holy Synod of St. Petersburg. It is translated into several languages,
   and since 1839 generally used in the schools and churches of Russia. It
   was sent to all the Eastern Patriarchs, and unanimously approved by
   them. [147]

   Philaret (born 1782, died 1867) was for forty-seven years (1820-67)
   Metropolitan of Moscow. He was intrusted with the important State
   secret of the will of Alexander I., and crowned his two successors
   (Nicholas I. and Alexander II.). He represents, in learning, eloquence,
   and ascetic piety, the best phase of the Russian State Church in the
   nineteenth century. [148]

   His longer Catechism (called a full catechism) is, upon the whole, the
   ablest and clearest summary of Eastern orthodoxy, and shows a
   disposition to support every doctrine by direct Scripture testimony. It
   follows the plan and division of the Orthodox Confession of Mogilas,
   and conforms to its general type of teaching, but it is more clear,
   simple, evangelical, and much better adapted for practical use. In a
   number of introductory questions it discusses the meaning of a
   catechism, the nature and necessity of right faith and good works,
   divine revelation, the holy tradition and Holy Scripture (as the two
   channels of the divine revelation and the joint rule of faith and
   discipline), the Canon of the Scriptures (exclusive of the Apocrypha,
   because 'not written in Hebrew'), with some account of the several
   books of the Old and New Testaments, and the composition of the
   Catechism. This is divided into three parts, like the Confession of
   Mogilas, according to the three cardinal virtues (1 Cor. xiii. 13).

   First Part: On Faith. An Exposition of the Nicene Creed, arranged in
   twelve articles. In the doctrine of the Church the Protestant
   distinction of the visible and invisible Church is, in a modified
   sense, adopted; Christ is declared to be the only and ever-abiding Head
   of the Church, and it is stated that the division of the Church into
   many particular and independent organizations, as those of Jerusalem,
   Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, Russia (Rome, Wittenberg, Geneva,
   and Canterbury are ignored); does not hinder them from being
   spiritually members 'of the one body of the Universal Church, from
   having one Head, Christ, and one spirit of faith and of grace.'

   Second Part: On Hope. An Exposition of the Lord's Prayer (in seven
   petitions), and of the nine Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount.

   Third Part: On Love or Charity. An Exposition of the Decalogue as
   teaching, in two tables, love to God and love to our neighbor. The last
   question is: 'What caution do we need when we seem to ourselves, to
   have fulfilled any commandment?  A. We must then dispose our hearts
   according to the words of Jesus Christ: "When ye have done all those
   things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we
   have done that which was our duty to do" (Luke xvii. 10).'

   3. Finally, we may mention, as secondary standards of Russian orthodoxy
   and discipline, the Primer or Spelling-Book, and a Treatise on The Duty
   of Parish Priests. [149]

   The Primer contains the rudiments of religious learning for children
   and the common people, viz., daily prayers (including the Lord's
   Prayer, and the 'Hail Mary, Virgin Mother of God,' yet without the
   'Pray for us' of the Latin formula), the Nicene Creed, the Ten
   Commandments (the second and fourth abridged), with brief explanations
   and short moral precepts.

   The Treatise on The Duty of Parish Priests was composed by George
   Konissky, Archbishop of Mogileff (died 1795), aided by Parthenius
   Sopkofsky, Bishop of Smolensk, and first printed at St. Petersburg in
   1776. All candidates for holy orders in the Russian Seminaries are
   examined on the contents of this book. It is mainly disciplinary and
   pastoral, a manual for the priests, directing them in their duties as
   teachers, and as administrators of the mysteries or sacraments. But
   doctrine is incidentally touched, and it is worthy of remark that this
   Treatise approaches more nearly to the evangelical principle of the
   supremacy of the Bible in matters of Christian faith and Christian life
   than any deliverance of the Eastern Church. [150]

   § 20. Anglo-Catholic Correspondence with the Russo-Greek Church.

   The Reformation of the sixteenth century proceeded entirely from the
   bosom of Latin or Western Catholicism. The Greek or Eastern Church had
   no part in the great controversy, and took no notice of it, until it
   was brought to its attention from without. The antagonism of the Greek
   Communion to Western innovations, especially to the claims of the
   Papacy, seemed to open the prospect of possible intercommunion and
   co-operation. But, so far, all the approaches to this effect on the
   part of Protestants have failed

   1. The first attempt was made by Lutheran divines in the sixteenth
   century, and ended in the condemnation of the Augsburg Confession.
   [151]

   2. Of a different kind was Cyril's movement, in the seventeenth
   century, to protestantize the Eastern Church from within, which
   resulted in a stronger condemnation of Calvinism and Lutheranism. [152]

   3. The correspondence of the Anglican Non-Jurors with Russia and the
   East, 1717-1723, had no effect whatever.

   Two high-church English Bishops; called 'Non-Jurors' (because they
   refused to renounce their oath of allegiance to King James II., and to
   transfer it to the Prince of Orange), in connection with two Scottish
   Bishops, assumed, October, 1717, the responsibility of corresponding
   with the Russian Czar, Peter the Great, and the Eastern Patriarchs.
   [153] They were prompted to this step by a visit of an Egyptian Bishop
   to England, who collected money for the impoverished patriarchal see of
   Alexandria, and probably still more by a desire to get aid and comfort
   from abroad in their schismatical isolation. They characteristically
   styled themselves 'The Catholic Remainder in Britain.'

   After a delay of several years, the Patriarchs, under date,
   Constantinople, September, 1723, sent their ultimatum, requiring, as a
   term of communion, absolute submission of the British to all the dogmas
   of the Greek Church. 'Those,' they wrote, 'who are disposed to agree
   with us in the Divine doctrines of the Orthodox faith must necessarily
   follow and submit to what has been defined and determined by ancient
   Fathers and the Holy OEcumenical Synods from the time of the Apostles
   and their Holy Successors, the Fathers of our Church, to this time. We
   say they must submit to them with sincerity and obedience, and without
   any scruple or dispute. And this is a sufficient answer to what you
   have written.' With this answer they forwarded the decrees of the Synod
   of Jerusalem of 1672.

   The Russians were more polite. The 'Most Holy Governing Synod' of St.
   Petersburg, in transmitting the ultimatum of the Eastern Patriarchs,
   proposed, in the name of the Czar, 'to the Most Reverend the Bishops of
   the Remnant of the Catholic Church in Great Britain, our Brethren most
   beloved in the Lord,' that they should send two delegates to Russia to
   hold a friendly conference, in the name and spirit of Christ, with two
   members to be chosen by the Russians, that it may be more easily
   ascertained what may be yielded and given up by one to the other; what,
   on the other hand, may and ought for conscience' sake to be absolutely
   denied. [154]

   But such a conference was never held. The death of Peter (1725) put an
   end to negotiations. Archbishop Wake, of Canterbury, wrote a letter to
   the Patriarch of Jerusalem, in which he exposed the Non-Jurors as
   disloyal schismatics and pretenders. The Eastern Patriarchs accused the
   Anglicans of being 'Lutherano-Calvinists,' and the Russian Church
   historian, Mouravieff, in speaking of the correspondence, represents
   them as being infected with the same 'German heresy,' which had been
   previously condemned by the Orthodox Church. [155]

   4. A far more serious and respectable attempt to effect intercommunion
   between the Anglican and Russo-Greek Churches was begun in 1862, with
   the high authority of the Convocation of Canterbury, and the General
   Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. The
   ostensible occasion was furnished by the multiplication of Russo-Greeks
   on the Pacific coast, and by the desirableness of securing decent
   burial for Anglican travelers in the East, but the real cause lies much
   deeper. It is closely connected with the powerful Anglo-Catholic
   movement, which arose in Oxford in 1833, and has ever since been aiming
   to de-protestantize the Anglican Church. Hundreds of her priests and
   laymen, headed by Dr. John H. Newman, seceded to Rome; while others,
   less logical or more loyal to the Church of their fathers, are afraid
   of the charms or corruptions of the Papacy, and look hopefully to
   intercommunion with the Holy Catholic Orthodox and Apostolic Mother
   Church of the East to satisfy their longing for Catholic unity, and to
   strengthen their opposition to Protestantism and Romanism. The writings
   of the late Dr. John Mason Neale, and Dr. Pusey's Eirenicon,
   contributed not a little towards creating an interest in this
   direction.

   In the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the
   United States, held in New York, October, 1862, a joint committee was
   appointed 'to consider the expediency of opening communication with the
   Russo-Greek Church, to collect authentic information upon the subject,
   and to report to the next General Convention.' Soon afterwards, July 1,
   1863, the Convocation of Canterbury appointed a similar committee,
   looking to 'such ecclesiastical intercommunion with the Orthodox East
   as should enable the laity and clergy of either Church to join in the
   sacraments and offices of the other without forfeiting the communion of
   their own Church.' The Episcopal Church in Scotland likewise fell in
   with the movement. These committees corresponded with each other, and
   reported from time to time to their authorities. Two Eastern Church
   Associations were formed, one in England and one in America, for the
   publication of interesting information on the doctrines and worship of
   the Russo-Greek Church. Visits were made to Russia, fraternal letters
   and Christian courtesies were exchanged, and informal conferences
   between Anglican and Russian dignitaries were held in London, St.
   Petersburg, and Moscow. [156]

   The Russo-Greeks could not but receive with kindness and courtesy such
   flattering approaches from two of the most respectable Churches of
   Christendom, but they showed no disposition whatever either to forget
   or to learn or to grant any thing beyond the poor privilege of burial
   to Anglicans in consecrated ground of the Orthodox (without, however,
   giving them any right of private property). Some were willing to admit
   that the Anglican Church, by retaining Episcopacy and respect for
   Catholic antiquity, 'attached her back by a strong cable to the ship of
   the Catholic Church; while the other Protestants, having cut this
   cable, drifted out at sea.' Yet they could not discover any essential
   doctrinal difference. They found strange novelties in the Thirty-nine
   Articles; they took especial offense at Art. 19, which asserts that the
   Churches of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch have erred; they
   expressed serious scruples about the validity of Anglican orders, on
   account of a flaw in Archbishop Barker's ordination, and on account of
   the second marriage of many Anglican priests and bishops (which they
   consider a breach of continency, and a flagrant violation of Paul's
   express prohibition, according to their interpretation of mias gunaikos
   andra, 1 Tim. iii. 2); they can not even recognize Anglican baptism,
   because it is not administered by trine immersion.

   On the other hand, the Russo-Greeks insist on the expulsion of the
   Filioque, which is their main objection to Rome; the recognition of the
   seventh oecumenical Council; the invocation of the Holy Virgin and the
   Saints; the veneration of icons; prayers for the departed; seven
   sacramental mysteries; trine immersion; a mysterious transformation
   (metousiosis) of the eucharistic elements; the eucharistic sacrifice
   for the living and the dead. [157]

   5. The latest phase of the Anglo-Greek movement is connected with the
   Old Catholic reunion Conferences in Bonn, 1874 and 1875. [158] Here the
   Filioque was surrendered as a peace-offering to the Orientals; but the
   Orientals made no concession on their part. It is not likely that the
   Anglican Church will sacrifice her own peace, the memory of her
   reformers and martyrs, and a Protestant history and literature of three
   centuries to an uncongenial union with the Russo-Greek Church in her
   present unreformed state.

   Besides the Orthodox Greek Church there are scattered in the East,
   mostly under Mohammedan and Russian rule, ancient Christian sects, the
   Nestorians and Monophysites. They represent petrified chapters of
   Church history, but at the same time fruitful fields for Roman Catholic
   and Protestant Missions. They owe their origin to the Christological
   controversies of the fifth century, and perpetuate, the one the
   Nestorian, the other the Eutychian heresy, though no more as living
   issues, but as dead traditions. They show the tenacity of
   Christological error. The Nestorians protest against the third
   oecumenical Council (431), the Monophysites against the fourth (451).
   In these points of dispute the Latin and the orthodox Protestant
   Churches agree with the Orthodox Greek Church against the schismatics.

   In other respects the Nestorians and Monophysites betray their Oriental
   character and original affinity with the Greek Church. They regard
   Scripture and tradition as co-ordinate sources of revelation and rules
   of faith. They accept the Nicene Creed without the Filioque; they have
   an episcopal and patriarchal hierarchy, and a ritualistic form of
   worship, only less developed than the orthodox. They use in their
   service their ancient native languages, although these have become
   obsolete and unintelligible to them, since they mostly speak now the
   Arabic. They honor pictures and relics of saints, but not to the same
   extent as the Greeks and Russians. The Bible is not forbidden, but
   practically almost unknown among the people. Their creeds are mostly
   contained in their liturgies.

   They supported the Arabs and Turks in the overthrow of the Byzantine
   Empire, and in turn were variously favored by them, and upheld in their
   separation from the Orthodox Greek Church. They are sunk in ignorance
   and superstition, but, owing to their prejudice against the Greek
   Church, they are more accessible to Western influence.

   Providence has preserved these Eastern sects, like the Jews, unchanged
   to this day, doubtless for wise purposes. They may prove entering
   wedges for the coming regeneration of the East and the conversion of
   the Mohammedans.

   I. The Nestorians, in Turkey and Persia, are called after Nestorius,
   Patriarch of Constantinople. He was condemned by the Council of
   Ephesus, 431, for so teaching the doctrine of two natures in Christ as
   virtually to deny the unity of person, and for refusing to call Mary
   'the Mother of God' (theotokos, Deipara), and he died in exile about
   440. His followers call themselves Chaldæan or Syrian Christians. They
   flourished for several centuries, and spread far into Arabia, India,
   and even to China and Tartary. Mohammed is supposed to have derived his
   imperfect knowledge of Christianity from a Nestorian monk, Sergius. But
   by persecution, famine, war, and pestilence, they have been greatly
   reduced. The Thomas Christians of East India are a branch of them, and
   so called from the Apostle Thomas, who is supposed to have preached on
   the coast of Malabar.

   The Nestorians hold fast to the dyophysite Christology of their master,
   and protest against the Council of Ephesus, for teaching virtually the
   Eutychian heresy, and unjustly condemning Nestorius. They can not
   conceive of a human nature without a human personality, and infer two
   independent hypostases from the existence of two natures in Christ.
   They object to the orthodox view, that it confounds the divine and
   human, or that it teaches a contradiction, viz., two natures and one
   person. The only alternative to them seems either two natures and two
   persons, or one person and one nature. From their Christology it
   follows that Mary was only the mother of the man Jesus. They therefore
   repudiate the worship of Mary as the Mother of God; also the use of
   images (though they retain the sign of the cross), the doctrine of
   purgatory (though they have prayers for the dead), and
   transubstantiation (though they hold the real presence of Christ in the
   eucharist); and they differ from the Greek Church by greater simplicity
   of worship. They are subject to a peculiar hierarchical organization,
   with eight orders, from the catholicus or patriarch to the sub-deacon
   and reader. The five lower orders, including the priests, may marry; in
   former times even the bishops, archbishops, and patriarchs had this
   privilege. Their fasts are numerous and strict. Their feast-days begin
   with sunset, as among the Jews. The patriarch and the bishops eat no
   flesh. The patriarch is chosen always from the same family; he is
   ordained by three metropolitans. The ecclesiastical books of the
   Nestorians are written in the Syriac language.

   II. The Monophysites, taken together, outnumber the Nestorians, and are
   scattered over the mountains, villages, and deserts of Armenia, Syria,
   Egypt, and Abyssinia. They are divided into four distinct sects: the
   Jacobites in Syria; the Copts in Egypt, with their ecclesiastical
   descendants in Abyssinia; [159] the Armenians, and the ancient
   Maronites on Mount Lebanon (who were Monothelites, but have been mostly
   merged into the Roman Church).

   The Armenians (numbering about three millions and a half) excel all the
   rest in numbers, intelligence, and enterprise, and are most accessible
   to Protestant missionaries.

   The Monophysites have their name from their distinctive doctrine, that
   Christ had but one nature (mone phusis), which was condemned by the
   fourth oecumenical Council of Chalcedon. They are the antipodes of the
   Nestorians, whom they call Dyophysites. They agree with the Council of
   Ephesus (431) which condemned Nestorius, but reject the Council of
   Chalcedon (451). They differ, however, somewhat from the Eutychean
   heresy of an absorption of the human nature by the divine, as held by
   Eutyches (a monk of Constantinople, died after 451), and teach that
   Christ had one composite nature (mia phusis sunthetos or mia phusis
   ditte). They make the humanity of Christ a mere accident of the
   immutable divine substance. Their main argument against the orthodox or
   Chalcedonian Christology is that the doctrine of two natures
   necessarily leads to that of two persons, and thereby severs the one
   Christ into two sons of God. They regarded the nature as something
   common to all individuals of a species (koinon), yet as never existing
   simply as such, but only in individuals. Their liturgical shibboleth
   was, God has been crucified, which they introduced into the trisagion,
   and hence they were also called Theopaschites.

   With the exception of the Chalcedonian Christology, the Monophysite
   sects hold most of the doctrines, institutions, and rites of the
   Orthodox Greek Church, but in simpler and less pronounced form. They
   reject, or at least do not recognize, the Filioque; they hold to the
   mass, or the eucharistic sacrifice, with a kind of transubstantiation;
   leavened bread in the Lord's Supper; baptismal regeneration by trine
   immersion; seven sacraments (yet not explicitly, since they either have
   no definite term for sacrament, or no settled conception of it); the
   patriarchal polity; monasticism; pilgrimages and fasting; the
   requisition of a single marriage for priests and deacons (bishops are
   not allowed to marry); the prohibition of the eating of blood or of
   things strangled. On the other hand, they know nothing of purgatory and
   indulgences, and have a simpler worship than the Greeks and Romans.
   According to their doctrine, all men after death go into Hades, a place
   alike without sorrow or joy; after the general judgment they enter into
   heaven, or are cast into hell; and meanwhile the intercessions and
   pious works of the living have an influence on the final destiny of the
   departed.

   Note on Russian Schismatics.--The dissenting sects of the Russo-Greek
   Church are very numerous, but not organized into separate communions
   like the older Oriental schismatics; the Russian government forbidding
   them freedom of public worship. They are private individuals or
   lay-communities, without churches and priests. They have no definite
   creeds, and differ from the national religion mostly on minor
   ceremonies. The most important among them are the Raskolniki (i.e.
   Separatists, Apostates), or, as they call themselves, the Starovers
   (Old Believers). They date from the time of Nicon, Patriarch of Moscow,
   and protest against the ritualistic innovations introduced by this
   remarkable man in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and
   afterwards by the Czar Peter the Great; they denounce the former as the
   false prophet, and the latter as the antichrist. They reject the
   benediction with three fingers instead of two, the pronouncing of the
   name of Jesus with two syllables instead of three, processions from
   right to left instead of the opposite course, the use of modern Russ in
   the service-books, the new mode of chanting, the use of Western
   pictures, the modern practice of shaving (unknown to the patriarchs,
   the apostles, and holy fathers), the use of tobacco (though not of
   whisky), and, till quite recently, also the eating of the potato (as
   the supposed apple of the devil, the forbidden fruit of paradise). They
   are again divided into several parties.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 22. Catholicism and Romanism.

   The Roman Catholic Church embraces over 180 millions of members, or
   more than one half of nominal Christendom. [160] It is spread all over
   the earth, but chiefly among the Latin races in Southern Europe and
   America. [161] It reaches in unbroken succession to the days of St.
   Peter and Paul, who suffered martyrdom in Rome. It is more fully
   developed and consolidated in doctrine, worship, and polity than any
   other Church. Its hierarchy is an absolute spiritual monarchy
   culminating in the Bishop of Rome, who pretends to be nothing less than
   the infallible Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth. It proudly identifies
   itself with the whole Church of Christ, and treats all other Christians
   as schismatics and heretics, who are outside of the pale of ordinary
   salvation.

   But this unproved assumption is the fundamental error of the system.
   There is a vast difference between Catholicism and Romanism. The former
   embraces all Christians, whether Roman, Greek, or Protestant; the
   latter is in its very name local, sectarian, and exclusive. The holy
   Catholic Church is an article of faith; the Roman Church is not even
   named in the ancient creeds. Catholicism extends through all Christian
   centuries; Romanism proper dates from the Council of Trent. Mediæval
   Catholicism looked towards the Reformation; Romanism excludes and
   condemns the Reformation. So ancient Judaism, as represented by
   Abraham, Moses, and the Prophets, down to John the Baptist, prepared
   the way for Christianity, as its end and fulfillment; while Judaism,
   after the crucifixion of the Messiah, and the destruction of Jerusalem,
   has become hostile to Christianity. 'Catholicism is the strength of
   Romanism; Romanism is the weakness of Catholicism.'

   In Romanism, again, a distinction must be made between the Romanism of
   the Council of Trent, and the Romanism of the Council of the Vatican.
   The 'Old Catholics' of Holland and Germany adhere to the former, but
   reject the latter as a new departure. But the papal absolutism has
   triumphed, and there is no room any longer for a moderate and liberal
   Romanism within the reign of the Papacy.

   The doctrinal standards of the Roman Catholic Church may accordingly be
   divided into three classes:

   1. The OEcumenical Creeds, which the Roman Church holds in common with
   the Greek, excepting the Filioque clause, which the Greek rejects as an
   unauthorized, heretical, and mischievous innovation. [162]

   2. The Roman or Tridentine Creeds, in opposition to the evangelical
   doctrines of the Reformation. Here belong the Council of Trent, the
   Profession of Pius IV., and the Roman Catechism. They sanction a number
   of doctrines, which were prepared in part by patristic and scholastic
   theology, papal decrees, and mediæval councils, but had always been
   more or less controverted, viz., tradition as a joint rule of faith,
   the extent of the canon including the Apocrypha, the authority of the
   Vulgate, the doctrine of the primitive state and original sin,
   justification by works as well as by faith, meritorious works, seven
   sacraments, transubstantiation, the withdrawal of the cup, the
   sacrifice of the mass for the living and the dead, auricular confession
   and priestly absolution, extreme unction, purgatory, indulgences, and
   obedience to the authority of the Pope as the successor of Peter and
   vicar of Christ.

   3. The modern Papal and Vatican decisions in favor of the immaculate
   conception of Mary, and the infallibility of the Pope. These were
   formerly open questions in the Roman Church, but are now binding dogmas
   of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [160] It is estimated that there are about 370 millions of Christians
   in the world, which is not much more than one fourth of the human
   family (1,370,000,000). Of these 370 millions the Roman Church may
   claim about 190, the Greek Church 80, the Protestant Church 100
   millions. But the estimates of the Roman Catholic population vary from
   180 to 200 millions.

   [161] Geographically speaking, the Roman Church may be called the
   Church of the South, the Greek Church the Church of the East, the
   Protestant Church the Church of the West.

   [162] The Greek Church is as much opposed to this Latin interpolation
   as ever. The Encyclical Epistle of the Eastern Patriarchs and other
   prelates, in reply to the Epistle of Pius IX., dated Jan. 6, 1848,
   urges no less than fifteen arguments against the Filioque, and reminds
   Pope Pius of the testimony of his predecessors, Leo III. and John
   VIII., 'those glorious and last orthodox Popes.' Leo, when appealed to
   by the delegates of Charlemagne, in 809, caused the original Nicene
   Creed to be engraved on two tablets of silver, on the one in Greek, on
   the other in Latin, and these to be suspended in the Basilica of St.
   Peter, to bear perpetual witness against the insertion of the Filioque.
   This fact, contrasted with the reverse action of later Popes, is one
   among the many proofs against papal infallibility.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 23. Standard Expositions of the Roman Catholic System.

   Italy, France, and Germany have successively furnished the ablest
   champions of the doctrinal system of Romanism in opposition to
   Protestantism. Their authority is, of course, subordinate to that of
   the official standards. But as faithful expounders of these standards
   they have great weight. In Romanism, learning is concentrated in a few
   towering individuals; while in Protestantism it is more widely
   diffused, and presents greater freedom and variety of opinion.

   1. The first commanding work in defense of Romanism, after many weak
   attempts of a purely ephemeral character, was written towards the close
   of the sixteenth century, more than fifty years after the beginning of
   the Protestant controversy, and about thirty years after the Council of
   Trent, by Robert Bellarmin (Roberto Bellarmino). He was born 1542, in
   Tuscany, entered the order of the Jesuits in 1560, became Professor of
   Theology at Louvain in 1570, and afterwards at Rome, was made a
   Cardinal in 1599, Archbishop of Capua in 1602, Librarian of the Vatican
   in 1605, and died at Rome Sept. 17, 1621, nearly eighty years old.
   Although the greatest controversialist of his age, he had a mild
   disposition, and was accustomed to say that 'an ounce of peace was
   worth more than a pound of victory.' His 'Disputations on the
   Controversies of the Christian Faith' are the most elaborate polemic
   theology of the Roman Church against the doctrines of the Protestant
   Reformation. [163] They abound in patristic and scholastic learning,
   logical acumen and dialectical ability. The differences between
   Romanism and Protestantism are clearly and accurately stated without
   any attempt to weaken them. And yet the book was placed on the Index
   Expurgatorius by Sixtus V. for two reasons; first, because Bellarmin
   introduces the doctrines of the Reformers in their own words, which it
   was feared might infect Romish readers with dangerous heresies; and,
   secondly, because he taught merely an indirect, not a direct, authority
   of the Pope in temporal matters. In France and Venice, on the contrary,
   even this doctrine of the indirect temporal supremacy was considered
   too ultramontane, and hence Bellarmin was never a favorite among the
   Gallicans. After the death of Sixtus V., the inhibition was removed.
   The work has ever since remained the richest storehouse of Roman
   controversialists, and can not be ignored by Protestants, although many
   arguments are now antiquated, and many documents used as genuine are
   rejected even by Catholics.

   2. Nearly a century elapsed before another champion of Romanism
   appeared, less learned, but more eloquent and popular, Jacques Bénigne
   Bossuet. He was born at Dijon, 1627, was educated by the Jesuits, tutor
   of the Dauphin 1670-81, Bishop of Meaux since 1681, Counselor of State
   1697, and died at Paris 1704. The 'Eagle of Meaux' was the greatest
   theological genius of France, and the oracle of his age, a man of
   brilliant intellect, untiring industry, magnificent eloquence, and
   equally distinguished as controversialist, historian, and pulpit
   orator. He is called 'the last of the fathers of the Church.' While the
   hypocritical and licentious Louis XIV. tried to suppress Protestantism
   in his kingdom by cruel persecution, Bossuet betook himself to the
   nobler and more successful task of convincing the opponents by
   argument.

   This he did in two works, the first apologetic, the second polemical.

   (a) Exposition de la doctrine de l'église catholique sur les matières
   de controverse. [164] This book is a luminous, eloquent, idealizing,
   and plausible defense of the characteristic doctrines of Romanism. It
   distinguishes between dogmas and theological opinions; presenting the
   former in a light that is least objectionable to reason, and disowning
   the latter when especially objectionable to Protestants. 'Bossuet
   assumes,' says Gibbon, 'with consummate art, the tone of candor and
   simplicity, and the ten-horned monster is transformed, by his magic
   touch, into a milk-white hind, who must be loved as soon as seen.'

   (b) Histoire des variations des églises protestantes. [165] This is an
   attempt to refute Protestantism, by presenting its history as a
   constant variation and change; while the Roman Catholic system remained
   the same, and thus proves itself to be the truth. The argument is
   plausible, but not conclusive. It would prove more for the Greek Church
   than for the Latin, which has certainly itself developed from patristic
   to mediæval, from mediæval to Tridentine, and from Tridentine to
   Vatican Romanism. Truth in God, or objectively considered, is
   unchangeable; but truth in man, or the apprehension of it, grows and
   develops with man and with history. Change, if it be consistent, is not
   necessarily a mark of heresy, but may be a sign of life and growth, as
   the want of change, on the other hand, is by no means always an
   indication of orthodoxy, but still more frequently of stagnation.

   Bossuet, with all his strong Roman Catholic convictions, was no
   infallibilist and no ultramontanist, but a champion of the Gallican
   liberties. He was the presiding genius of the clerical assembly of
   1682, which framed the famous four Gallican propositions; and he wrote
   a book in their defense, which was, however, not published till some
   time after his death. [166] He carried on a useless correspondence with
   the great Leibnitz for a reunion of the Catholic and Protestant
   churches, and proposed to this end a suspension of the anathemas of
   Trent and a general council in which Protestants should have a
   deliberative vote. Altogether, although he sanctioned the infamous
   revocation of the edict of Nantes (as 'le plus bel usage de l'autorité
   royale'), and secured the papal condemnation of the noble Fénelon (a
   man more humble and saint-like than himself), Bossuet can no longer be
   regarded as sound and orthodox, if judged by the standard of the
   Vatican Council. [167]

   3. The same may be said of John Adam Möhler, the greatest German divine
   of the Roman Church, a man of genius, learning, and earnest piety. He
   was born 1796, at Igersheim, in the Kingdom of Würtemberg; was
   Professor of Theology in the University of Tübingen since 1822, at
   Munich since 1835, where he died in 1838. The great work of his life is
   his Symbolics. [168] It is at once defensive and offensive, a
   vindication of Romanism and an attack upon Protestantism, and written
   with much freshness and vigor. It made a profound impression in Germany
   at a time when Romanism was believed to be intellectually dead or
   unable to resist the current of Protestant culture. Möhler was well
   acquainted with Protestant theology, and was influenced by the lectures
   and writings of Schleiermacher and Neander. [169] He divests Romanism
   of its gross superstitions, and gives it an ideal and spiritual
   character. He deals, upon the whole, fairly and respectfully with his
   opponents, but makes too much argumentative use of the private writings
   and unguarded utterances of Luther. He ignores the post-Tridentine
   deliverances of Rome, says not a word about papal infallibility, and,
   although not a Gallican, he represents the antagonism of the episcopal
   and papal systems as a wholesome check upon extremes. He recognizes the
   deep moral earnestness from which the Reformation proceeded, deplores
   the corruptions in the Church, sends many ungodly popes and priests to
   hell, and talks of a feast of reconciliation, preceded by a common
   humiliation and confession that all have sinned and gone astray, the
   Church alone [meaning the institution] is without spot or wrinkle.
   [170] His work called forth some very able Protestant replies,
   especially from Baur and Nitzsch. [171]

   4. Giovanni Perrone, born in Piedmont, 1794, Professor of Theology in
   the Jesuit College at Rome, wrote a system of dogmatics which is now
   most widely used in the Roman Church, and which most fully comes up to
   its present standard of orthodoxy. [172] Perrone defends the immaculate
   conception of Mary, and the infallibility of the Pope, and helped to
   mould the decrees of the Vatican Council. His method is scholastic and
   traditional, but divested of the wearisome and repulsive features of
   old scholasticism, and adapted to the modern state of controversy.

   Note.--English Works on Romanism.--England and the United States have
   not produced a classical theological work on Romanism, such as those
   above mentioned, but a number of compilations and popular defenses. We
   mention the following: The Faith of Catholics on certain points of
   Controversy, confirmed by Scripture and attested by the Fathers of the
   Church during the five first centuries of the Church, compiled by Rev.
   Jos. Berington and Rev. John Kirk, Lond. 1812, 1 vol.; 2d ed. 1830; 3d
   ed., revised and greatly enlarged, by Rev. James Waterworth, 1846, in 3
   vols. The End of Religious Controversy (Lond. 1818, and often since), a
   series of letters by the Rt. Rev. John Milner (born in London, 1752, d.
   1826). Lectures on the Principal Doctrines and Practices of the
   Catholic Church, delivered in London, 1836, by Cardinal Nicholas
   Wiseman (born in Spain, 1802, died in London, 1865).

   At present the ablest champions of Romanism in England are
   ex-Anglicans, especially Dr. John H. Newman (born in London, 1801) and
   Archbishop Henry Edward Manning (born in London, 1809, Wiseman's
   successor), who use the weapons of Protestant culture against the
   Church of their fathers and the faith of their early manhood. Manning
   is an enthusiastic infallibilist, but Newman acquiesced only
   reluctantly in the latest dogmatic development. [173]

   The principal apologists of the Romish Church in America are
   Archbishops Kenrick and Spaulding, Bishop England, Dr. Orestes Brownson
   (in his Review), and more recently the editors, chiefly ex-Protestants,
   of the monthly 'Catholic World.' We mention Francis Patrick Kenrick
   (Archbishop of Baltimore, born in Dublin 1797, died 1863): The Primacy
   of the Apostolic See Vindicated, 4th ed. Balt. 1855, and A Vindication
   of The Catholic Church, in a Series of Letters to the Rt. Rev. J. H.
   Hopkins, Balt. 1855. His brother, Peter Richard Kenrick, Archbishop of
   St. Louis, was an opponent of the infallibility dogma in the Vatican
   Council, but has since submitted, like the rest of the bishops. In a
   lengthy and remarkable speech, which he had prepared for the Vatican
   Council, but was prevented from delivering by the sudden close of the
   discussion, June 3, 1870, he shows that the doctrine of papal
   infallibility was not believed either in Ireland, his former home, or
   in America; on the contrary, that it was formally and solemnly disowned
   by British bishops prior to the Catholic Emancipation bill. [174]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] The Disputationes de controversiis Christianæ fidei adversus
   hujus temporis hereticos were first published at Ingolstadt, 1587-90, 3
   vols. folio; then at Venice (but with many errors); at Cologne, 1620;
   at Paris, 1688; at Prague, 1721; again at Venice, 1721-27; at Mayence,
   1842, and at Rome, 1832-40, in 4 vols. 4to. They are usually quoted by
   the titles of the different sections, De Verbo Dei, De Christo, De
   Romano Pontifice, De Conciliis et Ecclesia, Die Clericis, De Monachis,
   De Purgatorio, etc. The contemporary Annals of Baronius (d. 1607) are
   the most learned historical vindication of Romanism in opposition to
   Protestantism and the 'Magdeburg Centuries.'

   [164] First published in Paris 1671, sixth ed. 1686, and often since in
   French, German, English, and other languages. It was approved and
   commended by the French clergy, even by Pope and Cardinals at that
   time, and attained almost the authority of a symbolical book. But the
   Jesuit father Maimbourg disapproved it.

   [165] Paris, 1688, and often since in several languages. Compare also
   his Défense de l'histoire des variations contre M. Basnage. Sir James
   Stephen says of the Variations, that they bring to the religious
   controversy 'every quality which can render it either formidable or
   attractive.' The famous historian of the Decline and Fall of Rome was
   converted by this work to Romanism, but ended afterwards in infidelity.
   'Bossuet shows,' says Gibbon in his Memoirs, 'by a happy mixture of
   reasoning and narration, the errors, mistakes, uncertainties, and
   contradictions of our first Reformers, whose variations, as he
   learnedly maintains, bear the marks of error, while the uninterrupted
   unity of the Catholic Church is a sign and testimony of infallible
   truth. I read, approved, and believed.'

   [166] Defensio declarationis celeberrimæ, quam de potestate
   ecclesiaslica sanxit clerus Gallicanus 1682, ex speciali jussu Ludovici
   M. scripta, Luxemb. 1730, 2 vols.; in French, Paris, 1735, 2 vols.

   [167] Döllinger (Lectures on the Reunion of Churches, 1872, Engl.
   translation, p. 90) says: 'Bossuet puts aside the question of
   infallibility, as a mere scholastic controversy, having no relation to
   faith; and this was approved at Rome at the time. Now, of course, he is
   no longer regarded in his own country as the classical theologian and
   most eminent doctor of modern times; but as a man who devoted his most
   learned and comprehensive work, the labor of many years, to the
   establishment and defense of a fundamental error, and spent many years
   of his life in the perversion of facts and distortion of authorities.
   For that must be the present verdict of every infallibilist on
   Bossuet.'

   [168] 'Symbolik, oder Darstellung der dogmatischen Gegensätze der
   Katholiken und Protestanten nach ihren öffentlichen
   Bekenntniss-Schriften.' It appeared first in 1832, at Mayence; the
   sixth edition in 1843, and was translated into French, English, and
   Italian. The English translation is by James Burton Robertson, and
   bears the title, Symbolism; or, Exposition of the doctrinal differences
   between Catholics and Protestants, as evidenced in their symbolical
   writings (Lond. 1843, in 2 vols.; republished in 1 vol., New York,
   1844). It is preceded by a memoir of Möhler, and a superficial
   historical sketch of recent German Church history.

   [169] Neander told me that Möhler, when a student at Berlin,
   occasionally called on him, and seemed to him very modest, earnest, and
   inquiring after the truth. Hase calls him a 'delicate and noble mind,'
   and relates that when he began his academic career in Tübingen with
   him, Möhler was filled with youthful ideals, and regarded by Catholics
   as heterodox. (Handbuch der Prot. Polemik, Pref. p. ix.)

   [170] Symbolik (6th edition, p. 353): 'Unstreitig liessen es auch oft
   genug Priester, Bischöfe und Päpste, gewissenlos und unverantwortlich,
   selbst dort fehlen, wo es nur von ihnen abhing, ein schöneres Leben zu
   begründen; oder sie löschten gar noch durch ärgerliches Leben und
   Streben den glimmenden Docht aus, welchen sie anfachen sollten: die
   Hölle hat sie verschlungen. . . . Beide [Katholiken und Protestanten]
   müssen schuldbewusst ausrufen: Wir Alle haben gefehlt, nur die Kirche
   ist's, die nicht fehlen kann; wir Alle haben gesündigt, nur sie ist
   unbefleckt auf Erden.' Incidentally Möhler denies the papal
   infallibility, when he says (p. 336): 'Keinem einzelnen als solchen
   kommt diese Unverirrlichkeit zu.'

   [171] Baur's Gegensatz des Katholicismus and Protestantismus (Tübingen,
   1833, 2d ed. 1836), in learning, grasp, and polemical dexterity, is
   fully equal or superior to Möhler's Symbolik, but not orthodox, and
   elicited a lengthy and rather passionate defense from his Catholic
   colleague (Neue Untersuchungen, Mainz, 1834). Nitzsch's Protestantische
   Beantwortung der Möhlerschen Symbolik (Hamb. 1835) is sound,
   evangelical, calm, and dignified. It is respectfully mentioned, but not
   answered, by Möhler. Marheineke and Sartorius wrote, likewise, able
   replies. A counterpart of Möhler's Symbolik is Hase's Handbuch der
   Protestantischen Polemik gegen die Römisch-Katholische Kirche, Leipz.
   1862; 3d ed. 1871. Against this work Dr. F. Speil wrote Die Lehren der
   Katholischen Kirche, gegenüber der Protestantischen Polemik, Freiburg,
   1865, which, compared with Möhler's book, is a feeble defense.

   [172] Prælectiones theologicæ quas in Collegio Romano Societatis Jesu
   habebat J. P. They appeared first at Rome, 1835 sqq., in 9 vols. 8vo;
   also at Turin (31st ed. 1865 sqq. in 9 vols.); at Paris (1870, in 4
   vols.); at Brussels, and Ratisbon. His compend, Prælectiones theologicæ
   in Compendium redactæ, has been translated into several languages.
   Perrone wrote also separate works, De Jesu Christi Divinitate (Turin,
   1870, 3 vols.); De virtutibus fidei, spei et caritatis (Tur. 1867, 2
   vols.); De Matrimonio Christiano (Lond. 1861), and on the Immaculate
   Conception of Mary.

   [173] The views of the older English Romanists are compiled and
   classified by Samuel Capper (a Quaker), in the work, The Acknowledged
   Doctrines of the Church of Rome . . . as set forth by esteemed doctors
   of the said Church, Lond. 1850 (pp. 608). It consists mostly of
   extracts from the comments in the Douay version of the Scriptures.

   The principal source and the highest standard of the doctrine and
   discipline of the Roman Church are the Canons and Decrees of the
   Council of Trent, first published in 1564, at Rome, by authority of
   Pius IV. [175]

   The Council of Trent (1543-63) is reckoned by the Roman Church as the
   eighteenth (or twentieth) oecumenical Council. [176] It is also the
   last, with the exception of the Vatican Council of 1870, which, having
   proclaimed the Pope infallible, supersedes the necessity and use of any
   future councils, except for unmeaning formalities. It was called forth
   by the Protestant Reformation, and convened for the double purpose of
   settling the doctrinal controversies, which then agitated and divided
   Western Christendom, and of reforming discipline, which the more
   serious Catholics themselves, including even an exceptional Pope
   (Adrian VI.), desired and declared to be a crying necessity. [177] The
   Popes, jealous of deliberative assemblies, which might endanger their
   absolute authority, and afraid of reform movements, which might make
   concessions to heretics, pursued a policy of evasion and intrigue, and
   postponed the council again and again, until they were forced to yield
   to the pressure of public opinion. Pius IV. told the Venetian
   embassador that his predecessors had professed a wish for a council,
   but had not really desired it.

   In the early stages of the Reformation, Luther himself appealed to a
   general council, but he came to the conviction that even general
   councils had erred (e.g., the Council of Constance in condemning Hus),
   so that he had to trust exclusively to the Word of God and the Spirit
   of God in history. In deference to the special wish of the Emperor
   Charles V., the evangelical princes and divines were invited; but being
   refused a deliberative voice, they declined. 'They could not fail,'
   they replied, 'to appreciate the efforts of the Emperor, and they
   themselves were longing for an impartial council to be controlled by
   the supreme authority of the Scriptures, but they could not acknowledge
   nor attend a Roman council where their cause was to be judged after
   papal decrees and scholastic opinions, which had always found
   opposition in the Church. The council promised by the Pope would be
   neither free nor Christian, nor oecumenical, nor ruled by the Word of
   God; it would only confirm the authority of the Pope, on whom it was
   depending, and prove a new compulsion of conscience.' The result shows
   that these apprehensions were well founded. [178]

   After long delays the Council was opened by order of Pope Paul III., in
   the Austrian City of Trent (since 1917, belonging to Italy), on the
   13th December, 1545, and lasted, with long interruptions, till the 4th
   of December, 1563. The attendance varied in the three periods: under
   Paul III. the number of prelates never exceeded 57, under Julius III.
   it rose to 62, under Pius IV. it was much larger, but never reached the
   number of the first oecumenical Council (318). The decrees were signed
   by 255 members, viz., 4 legates of the Pope, 2 Cardinals, 3 Patriarchs,
   25 Archbishops, 168 Bishops, 39 representatives of absent prelates, 7
   Abbots, and 7 Generals of different orders. Two thirds of them were
   Italians. &gt;From France and Poland only a few dignitaries were
   present; the greater part of the German Bishops were prevented from
   attendance by the war between the Emperor and the Protestants in
   Germany. The theologians who assisted the members of the Synod belonged
   to the monastic orders most devoted to the Holy See.

   The pontifical party controlled the preliminary deliberations as well
   as the final decisions, in spite of those who maintained the rights of
   an independent episcopacy. [179]

   During a period of nearly twenty years twenty-five public sessions were
   held, of which about one half were spent in mere formalities. But the
   principal work was done in the committees or congregations. The
   articles of dispute were always fixed by the papal legates, who
   presided. They were then first discussed, often with considerable
   difference of opinion, in the private sessions of the 'Congregations,'
   and after being secretly reported to, and approved by, the court of
   Rome, the Synod, in public session, solemnly proclaimed the decisions.
   They are generally framed with consummate scholastic skill and
   prudence.

   The decisions of the Council relate partly to doctrine, partly to
   discipline. The former are divided again into Decrees (decreta), which
   contain the positive statement of the Roman dogma, and into short
   Canons (canones), which condemn the dissenting views with the
   concluding 'anathema sit.' The Protestant doctrines, however, are
   almost always stated in an exaggerated form, in which they would hardly
   be recognized by a discriminating evangelical divine, or they are mixed
   up with real heresies, which Protestants condemn as emphatically as the
   Church of Rome. [180]

   The doctrinal sessions, which alone concern us here, are the following:

   SESSIO III.

   Decretum de Symbolo Fidei (accepting the Niceno Constantinopolitan
   Creed as a basis of the following decrees (Febr. 4, 1546).
   " IV. Decretum de Canonicis Scripturis (Apr. 8, 1546).
   " V. De Peccato Originali (June 17, 1546).
   " VI. De Justificatione (Jan. 13, 1547).
   " VII. De Sacramentis in genere, and some Canones de Baptismo et
   Confirmatione (March 3, 1547).
   " VIII. De Eucharistiæ Sacramento (Oct. 11, 1551).
   " XIV. De S. Poenitentiæ et Extreme Unctionis Sacramento (Nov. 25,
   1551).
   " XXI. De Communione sub utraque Specie et Parvulorum (July 16, 1562).
   " XXII. Doctrina de Sacrificio Missæ (Sept. 17, 1562).
   " XXIII. Vera et Catholica de Sacramento Ordinis doctrina (July 15,
   1563).
   " XXIV. Doctrina de Sacramento Matrimonii (Nov. 11, 1563).
   " XXV.

   Decretum de Purgatorio, Doctrina de Invocatione, Veneratione et
   Reliquiis Sanctorum, et sacris Imaginibus. Decreta de Indulgentiis, de
   Delectu Ciborum, Jejuniis et Diebus Festis, de Indice Librorum,
   Catechismo, Breviario et Missali (Dec. 3 and 4, 1563).


   The last act of the Council was a double curse upon all heretics. [181]

   The decrees, signed by 255 fathers, were solemnly confirmed by a bull
   of Pius IV. (Benedictus Deus et Pater Domini nostri, etc.) on the 26th
   January, 1564, with the reservation of the exclusive right of
   explanation to the Pope.

   The Council was acknowledged in Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, the Low
   Countries, Poland, and the Roman Catholic portion of the German Empire;
   but mostly with a reservation of the royal prerogatives. In France it
   was never published in form. No attempt was made to introduce it into
   England. Pius IV. sent the acts to Queen Mary of Scots, with a letter,
   dated June 13, 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but
   without effect. [182]

   The Council of Trent, far from being truly oecumenical, as it claimed
   to be, is simply a Roman Synod, where neither the Protestant nor the
   Greek Church was represented; the Greeks were never invited, and the
   Protestants were condemned without a hearing. But in the history of the
   Latin Church, it is by far the most important clerical assembly, unless
   the unfinished Vatican Council should dispute with it that honor, as it
   far exceeded it in numbers. It completed, with the exception of a few
   controverted articles, the doctrinal system of mediæval Catholicism,
   and stamped upon it the character of exclusive Romanism. It settled its
   relation to Protestantism by thrusting it out of its bosom with the
   terrible solemnities of an anathema. Papal diplomacy and intrigue
   outmanaged all the more liberal elements. At the same time the Council
   abolished various crying abuses, and introduced wholesome disciplinary
   reforms, as regards the sale of indulgences, the education and morals
   of the clergy, the monastic orders, etc. Thus the Protestant
   Reformation, after all, had indirectly a wholesome effect upon the
   Church which condemned it.

   The original acts of the Council, as prepared by its general secretary,
   Bishop Angelo Massarelli, in six large folio volumes, are deposited in
   the Vatican, and have remained there unpublished for more than three
   hundred years. But most of the official documents and private reports
   bearing upon the Council were made known in the sixteenth century, and
   since. The most complete collection of them is that of Le Plat. New
   materials were brought to light by Mendham (from the manuscript history
   of Cardinal Paleotto), by Sickel, and by Döllinger. The genuine acts,
   but only in part, were edited by Theiner (1874).

   The history of the Council was written chiefly by two able and learned
   Catholics of very different spirit: the liberal, almost semi-Protestant
   monk Fra Paolo Sarpi, of Venice (first, 1619); and, in the interest of
   the papacy, by Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini (1656), who had access to
   all the archives of Rome. Both accounts must be compared.

   The first learned and comprehensive criticism of the Tridentine
   doctrine, from a Protestant point of view, was prepared by an eminent
   Lutheran theologian, Martin Chemnitz (d. 1586), in his Examen Concilii
   Tridentini (1565-73, 4 Parts), best ed., Frankf., 1707; republished,
   Berlin, 1861. [183]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [175] The editor of this rare authentic edition was the learned Paulus
   Manutius (Paolo Manuzio), Professor of Eloquence and Director of the
   Printing-Press of the Venetian Academy, settled at Rome 1561, and died
   there 1574. Not to be confounded with his father, Aldo Manuzio, sen.
   (1447-1515), the editor of the celebrated editions of the classics; nor
   with his son, Aldo Manuzio, the younger (1547-1597), likewise a printer
   and writer, and Professor of Eloquence.

   [176] There is a dispute about the reformatory Councils of Pisa (1409),
   Constance (1414-18), and Basle (1431), which are acknowledged by the
   Gallicans, but rejected by the Ultramontanists, or accepted only in
   part, i.e., as far as they condemned and punished heretics (Hus and
   Jerome of Prague). The Council of Ferrara and Florence (1439) is
   regarded as a continuation of, or a substitute for, the Council of
   Basle. There is also a dispute among Roman historians about the
   oecumenical character of the Council of Sardica (343), the Quinisexta
   (692), the Council of Vienne (1311), and the fifth Lateran (1512-17).
   See Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, Vol. I. 50 sqq.

   [177] Adrian VI., from Holland, the teacher of Charles V., and the last
   non-Italian Pope, succeeded Leo X. in 1522, but ruled only one year.
   'He died of the papacy.' He was a man of ascetic piety, and openly
   confessed, through his legate Chieregati, at the Diet of Nurnberg, that
   the Church was corrupt and diseased, from the Pope and the papal court
   to the members; but at the same time he demanded the sharpest measures
   against Luther as a second Mohammed. Twelve years later, Paul III.
   (1534-49) appointed a reform commission of nine pious Roman prelates,
   who in a memorial declared that the Pope's absolute dominion over the
   whole Church was the source of all this corruption; but he found it
   safer to introduce the Inquisition instead of a reformation.

   [178] At the second period of the Council, 1552, a number of Protestant
   divines from Württemberg, Strasburg, and Saxony, arrived in Trent, or
   were on the way, but they demanded a revision of the previous decrees
   and free deliberation, which were refused.

   [179] The overruling influence of the papal court over the Council
   rests not only on the authority of Paolo Sarpi, but on many
   contemporary testimonies, e.g., the reports of Franciscus de Vargas, a
   zealous Catholic, who was used by Charles V. and Philip II. for the
   most important missions, who watched the proceedings of the Council at
   Trent from 1551 to '52 and gave minute information to Granvella. See
   Lettres et Mémoires de Fr. de Vargas, de Pierre de Malvenda et des
   quelques erèques d'Espagne, trad. par Michel le Vassor, Amst. 1699;
   also in Latin, by Schramm, Brunswick. 1704. Le Plat pronounced this
   correspondence fictitious, but its authenticity has been sufficiently
   established (see Köllner, l.c. pp. 40, 41).

   [180] Thus the Canones de Justificatione (Sess. VI.) reject Pelagianism
   and Semi-Pelagianism, as well as Solifidianism and Antinomianism.

   [181] The Cardinal of Lorraine said, 'Anathema cunctis hereticis.' To
   this the fathers responded, 'Anathema, Anathema.'

   [182] On the reception, see the seventh volume of Le Plat's Collection
   of Documents, Courayer's Histoire de la reception du Concil de Trente,
   dans les differens états catholiques, Amst. 1756 (Paris, 1766), and
   Köllner, l.c. pp. 121-129.

   [183] The editor, Ed. Preuss, has since become a Romanist at St. Louis
   (1871).

   Next in authority to the decrees of the Council of Trent, or virtually
   superior to it, stands the Professio Fidei Tridentinæ, or the Creed of
   Pius IV. [184]

   It was suggested by the Synod of Trent, which in its last two sessions
   declared the necessity of a binding formula of faith (formula
   professionis et juramenti) for all dignitaries and teachers of the
   Catholic Church. [185] It was prepared by order of Pope Pius IV., in
   1564, by a college of Cardinals.

   It consists of twelve articles: the first contains the Nicene Creed in
   full, the remaining eleven are a clear and precise summary of the
   specific Roman doctrines as settled by the Council of Trent, together
   with the important additional declaration that the Roman Church is the
   mother and teacher of all the rest, and with an oath of obedience to
   the Pope, as the successor of the Prince of the apostles, and the vicar
   of Christ. [186] The whole is put in the form of an individual
   profession ('Ego, ----, firma fide credo et profiteor'), and of a
   solemn vow and oath ('spondeo, voveo ac juro. Sic me Deus adjuvet, et
   hæc sancta Evangelia').

   This formula was made binding, in a double bull of Nov. 13, 1564
   ('Injunctum noblis'), and Dec. 9, 1564 ('In sacrosancta beati Petri,
   principis apostolorum, cathedra,' etc.), upon the whole ecclesia
   docens, i.e., upon all Roman Catholic priests and public teachers in
   Catholic seminaries, colleges, and universities. Besides, it has come
   to be generally used, without special legislation, as a creed for
   Protestant converts to Romanism, and hence it is called sometimes the
   'Profession of Converts.' [187] For both purposes it is far better
   adapted than the Decrees of the Council of Trent, which are too learned
   and extensive for popular use.

   As this Profession of Pius IV. is the most concise and, practically,
   the most important summary of the doctrinal system of Rome, we give it
   in full, and arrange it in three parts, so that the difference between
   the ancient Catholic faith, the later Tridentine faith, and the oath of
   obedience to the Pope as the vicar of Christ, may be more clearly seen.
   It should be remembered that the Nicene Creed was regarded by the
   ancient Church as final, and that the third and fourth oecumenical
   Councils solemnly, and on the pain of deposition and excommunication,
   forbade the setting forth of any new creed. [188] To bring the
   Tridentine formula up to the present standard of Roman orthodoxy, it
   would require the two additional dogmas of the immaculate conception,
   and papal infallibility.

   TRANSLATION OF THE PROFESSION. [189]

   I. The Nicene Creed of 381, with the Western Changes.

   (See p. 27.)

   1. I, ----, with a firm faith, believe and profess all and every one of
   the things contained in the symbol of faith, which the holy Roman
   Church makes use of, viz.:

   I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth,
   and of all things visible and invisible.

   And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of
   the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of
   very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father;
   by whom all things were made;

   Who, for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was
   incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man;

   He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate; suffered and was buried;

   And the third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures;

   And ascended into heaven; sitteth on the right hand of the Father;

   And he shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead;
   whose kingdom shall have no end.

   And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and Giver of life; who proceedeth from
   the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is
   worshiped and glorified; who spake by the Prophets.

   And one holy catholic and apostolic Church;

   I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins;

   And I look for the resurrection of the dead;

   And the life of the world to come. Amen.

   II. Summary of the Tridentine Creed (1563).

   2. I most steadfastly admit and embrace the apostolic and
   ecclesiastical traditions, and all other observances and constitutions
   of the same Church.

   3. I also admit the holy Scriptures according to that sense which our
   holy Mother Church has held, and does hold, to which it belongs to
   judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures; neither
   will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than according to the
   unanimous consent of the Fathers (juxta unanimem consensum Patrum).
   [190]

   4. I also profess that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of
   the new law, instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary for the
   salvation of mankind, though not all for every one, to wit: baptism,
   confirmation, the eucharist, penance and extreme unction, holy orders,
   and matrimony; and that they confer grace; and that of these, baptism,
   confirmation, and ordination can not be reiterated without sacrilege. I
   also receive and admit the received and approved ceremonies of the
   Catholic Church used in the solemn administration of the aforesaid
   sacraments.

   5. I embrace and receive all and every one of the things which have
   been defined and declared in the holy Council of Trent concerning
   original sin and justification.

   6. I profess likewise that in the mass there is offered to God a true,
   proper, and propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead (verum,
   proprium, et propitiatorium sacrificium pro vivis et defunctis); and
   that in the most holy sacrament of the eucharist there is truly,
   really, and substantially (vere, realiter, et substantialiter) the body
   and blood, together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus
   Christ; and that there is made a change of the whole essence
   (conversionem totius substantiæ) of the bread into the body, and of the
   whole essence of the wine into the blood; which change the Catholic
   Church calls transubstantiation.

   7. I also confess that under either kind alone Christ is received whole
   and entire, and a true sacrament.

   8. I firmly hold that there is a purgatory, and that the souls therein
   detained are helped by the suffrages of the faithful.

   Likewise, that the saints reigning with Christ are to be honored and
   invoked (venerandos atque invocandos esse), and that they offer up
   prayers to God for us; and that their relics are to be held in
   veneration (esse venerandas). [191]

   9. I most firmly assert that the images of Christ and of the perpetual
   Virgin, the Mother of God, and also of other saints, ought to be had
   and retained, and that due honor and veneration are to be given them.

   I also affirm that the power of indulgences was left by Christ in the
   Church, and that the use of them is most wholesome to Christian people.
   [192]

   III. Additional Articles and Solemn Pledges (1564).

   10. I acknowledge the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church as the
   mother and mistress of all churches, and I promise and swear (spondeo
   ac juro) true obedience to the Bishop of Rome, as the successor of St.
   Peter, prince of the Apostles, and as the vicar of Jesus Christ.

   11. I likewise undoubtingly receive and profess all other things
   delivered, defined, and declared by the sacred Canons and oecumenical
   Councils, and particularly by the holy Council of Trent; and I condemn,
   reject, and anathematize all things contrary thereto, and all heresies
   which the Church has condemned, rejected, and anathematized.

   12. I do at this present freely profess and truly hold this true
   Catholic faith, without which no one can be saved (extra quam nemo
   salvus esse potest); and I promise most constantly to retain and
   confess the same entire and inviolate, [193] with God's assistance, to
   the end of my life. And I will take care, as far as in me lies, that it
   shall be held, taught, and preached by my subjects, or by those the
   care of whom shall appertain to me in my office. This I promise, vow,
   and swear--so help me God, and these holy Gospels of God.

   [184] The original name was Forma juramenti professionis fidei. In the
   two papal bulls which published and enjoined the creed, it is called
   Forma professionis fidei catholicæ, or orthodoxæ fidei. The usual name
   is Professio fidei Tridentinæ (or P. f. Tridentina, which is properly a
   misnomer). See Mohnike, l.c. p. 3, and Köllner, 1.c. p. 150.

   [185] Sess. XXV. cap. 2 De Reformatione (p. 439, ed. Richter): 'Cogit
   temporum calamitas et invalescentium hæresum malitia, ut nihil sit
   prætermittendum, quod ad populorum ædificationem et catholicæ fidei
   præsidium videatur posse pertinere. Præcipit igitur sancta synodus
   patriarchis, primatibus, archiepiscopis, episcopis, et omnibus aliis,
   qui de jure vel consuetudine in concilio provinciali interesse debent,
   ut in ipsa prima synodo provinciali, post finem præsentis concilii
   habenda, ea omnia et singula, quæ ab hac sancta synodo definita et
   statuta sunt, palam recipiant, nec non veram obedientiam summo Romano
   Pontifici spondeant et profiteantur, simulque hæreses omnes, a sacris
   canonibus et generalibus conciliis, præsertimque ab hac eadme synodo
   damnatas, publice detestentur et anathematizent.' Comp. Sess. XXIV. De
   Reformatione, cap. 12, where an examination and profession (orthodoxæ
   fidei publica professio) is required from the clergy, together with a
   vow to remain obedient to the Roman Church (in ecclesiæ Romanæ
   obedientia se permansuros spondeant ac jurent).

   [186] 'Sanctum catholicam et apostolicam Romanam ecclesiam omnium
   ecclesiarum matrem et magistram agnosco, Romanoque Pontifici, beati
   Petri Apostolorum principis successori ac Jesu Christi vicario, veram
   obedientiam spondeo ac juro.' Here the 'catholic' Church is identified
   with the 'Roman' Church, and true obedience to the Pope is made a test
   of catholicity. The union decree of the Council of Florence makes a
   similar assertion (see Hardouin, Acta Conc. ix. 423): 'Item definimus,
   sanctam apostolicam sedem et Romanum Pontificem in universum orbem
   tenere primatum, et ipsum Pontificem Romanum successorem esse beati
   Petri principis Apostolorum, et verum Christi vicarium, totiusque
   ecclesiæ caput et omnium Christianorum patrem et doctorem existere.'
   But the integrity of the text of this famous union formula is disputed,
   and the Greeks and Latins charge each other with corruption. Some Greek
   copies omit the proud words ton Rhomaikon archierea eis pasan ten
   oikoumenen to proteion katechein. Comp. Theod. Frommann: Zur Kritik des
   Florentiner Unionsdecrets and seiner dogmatischen Verwerthung beim
   Vaticanischen Concil, Leipz. 1870, pp. 40 sqq.

   [187] For converts from the Greek Church the form was afterwards (1575)
   modified by a reference to the compromise of the Council of Florence.
   See the Professio Fidei Græcis præscripta a Gregorio XIII., in
   Denzinger's Enchir., p. 294, and the Professio Fidei Orientalibus
   præscripta ab Urbano VIII. et Benedicto XIV., ibid., p. 296. For
   Protestants other forms of abjuration were occasionally used, without
   official sanction. The infamous Hungarian formula for Protestant
   converts (Confessio novorum Catholicorum in Hungaria, first published
   1674) is disowned by liberal Catholics as a foul Protestant forgery,
   but seems to have been used occasionally by Jesuits during the cruel
   persecutions of Protestants in Hungary and Bohemia in the 17th century.
   It contains the most extravagant Jesuit views on the authority of the
   Pope, the worship of the Virgin, the power of the priesthood, and
   pronounces awful curses on Protestant parents, teachers, and relations
   ('maledictos pronuntiamus parentes nostros,' etc.), and on the
   evangelical faith, with the promise to persecute this faith in every
   possible way, even by the sword ('Juramus etiam, donec una gutta
   sanguinis in corpore nostro exstiterit, doctrinam maledictam illam
   evangelicam nos omnimodo, clam et aperte, violenter et fraudulenter,
   verbo et facto persecuturos, ense quoque non excluso'). See the formula
   in Mohnike, l.c. pp. 88-92, in Streitwolf and Klener, II. pp. 343-346;
   and an account of the controversies concerning it in Köllner, l.c. pp.
   159-165, and especially the monograph of Mohnike: Zur Geschichte des
   Ungarischen Fluchformulars (an Appendix to his History of the
   Profession of the Tridentine Faith), Greifswald, 1823, 264 pages. A
   copy of this rare book is in the library of the Union Theological
   Seminary of New York.

   definition of faith.

   p. 98. Also Mirbt, pp. 337-40. For additions to the oath, Vol. II. 210.

   [190] It is characteristic that the Scriptures are put after the
   traditions, and admitted only in a restricted sense, the Roman Church
   being made the only interpreter of the Word of God. Protestantism
   reverses the order, and makes the Bible the rule and corrective of
   ecclesiastical traditions.

   other works on the subject.


   The Roman Catechism was proposed by the Council of Trent, which entered
   upon some preparatory labors, but at its last session committed the
   execution to the Pope. [194] The object was to regulate the important
   work of popular religious instruction, and to bring it into harmony
   with the decisions of the Council. [195] Pius IV. (d. 1565), under the
   advice of Cardinal Carlo Borromeo (Archbishop of Milan), intrusted the
   work to four eminent divines, viz., Leonardo Marini (afterwards
   Archbishop of Lanciano), Egidio Foscarari (Bishop of Modena), Muzio
   Calini (Archbishop of Jadera-Zara, in Dalmatia), and Francesco Fureiro
   (of Portugal). Three of them were Dominicans (as was the Pope himself).
   This explains the subsequent hostility of the Jesuits. Borromeo
   superintended the preparation with great care, and several accomplished
   Latin scholars, especially Jul. Pogianus, aided in the style of
   composition. [196] The Catechism was begun early in 1564, and
   substantially finished in December of the same year, but subjected for
   revision to Pogianus in 1565, and again to a commission of able divines
   and Latinists. It was finally completed in July, 1566, and published by
   order of Pope Pius V., in September, 1566, and soon translated into all
   the languages of Europe. Several Popes and Bishops recommended it in
   the highest terms. The Dominicans and Jansenists often appealed to its
   authority in the controversies about free will and divine grace, but
   the Jesuits (Less, Molina, and others) took ground against it, and even
   charged it with heresy.

   The work is intended for teachers (as the title ad Parochos indicates),
   not for pupils. It is a very full popular manual of theology, based
   upon the decrees of Trent. It answers its purpose very well, by its
   precise definitions, lucid arrangement, and good style.

   The Roman Catechism treats, in four parts: 1, de Symbolo apostolico;
   2, de Sacramentis;  3, de Decalogo;  4, de Oratione Dominica. It was
   originally written and printed without divisions. [197] Its theology
   belongs to the school of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, and hence it
   displeased the Jesuits. While it passes by certain features of the
   Roman system, as the indulgences and the rosary, it treats of others
   which were not touched upon by the Fathers of Trent, as the limbus
   patrum, the doctrine of the Church, and the authority of the Pope.

   Notwithstanding the high character and authority of this production, it
   did not prevent the composition and use of many other catechisms,
   especially of a more popular kind and in the service of Jesuitism. The
   most distinguished of these are two Catechisms of the Jesuit Peter
   Canisius (a larger one for teachers, 1554, and a smaller one for
   pupils, 1566); the Catechism of Cardinal Bellarmin (1603), which
   Clement VIII. and later Popes commended as an authentic and useful
   exposition of the Roman Catechism, and which is much used by
   missionaries; and the Catechism of Bossuet for the diocese of Meaux
   (1687). The Roman Church allows an endless multiplication of such
   educational books with adaptations to different nationalities, ages,
   degrees of culture, local wants and circumstances, provided they agree
   with the doctrinal system set forth by the Council of Trent. Most of
   these books, however, must now be remodeled and adjusted to the Council
   of the Vatican. [198]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [194] Sessio XXIV. De Reformatione, cap. 7 (ed. Richter, p. 344), the
   Bishops are directed to provide for the instruction of Catholics,
   'juxta formam a sancta synodo in catechesi singulis sacramentis
   præscribendam, quam episcopi in vulgarem linguam fideliter verti, atque
   a parochis omnibus populo exponi curabunt.' According to Sarpi, a draft
   of the proposed Catechism was laid before the Synod, but rejected. In
   the 25th and last session (held Dec. 24, 1563), the Synod intrusted the
   Pope (Pius IV.) with the preparation of an index of prohibited books, a
   catechism, and an edition of the liturgical books ('idemque de
   catechismo a Patribus, quibus illud mandatum fuerat, et de missali, et
   breviario fieri mandat,' p. 471).

   [195] Several catechisms, not properly authorized, had appeared before
   and during the Council of Trent to counteract the Lutheran and Reformed
   Catechisms, which did so much to spread and popularize the Reformation.
   See a list of them in Streitwolf and Klener, I. p. i.-iv., and in
   Köllner, p. 169.

   [196] Winer, Guericke, Möhler, and others, ascribe the Latinity of the
   Catechism to Paulus Manutius, the printer of the same; but he himself,
   in his epistles, where he mentions all his literary labors, says
   nothing about it.

   [197] The division into four parts, and of these into chapters and
   questions, appeared first in the edition of Fabricius Lodius, Col.
   1572, and Antw. 1574. Other editions vary in the arrangement.

   [198] Thus, for instance, in Keenan's Controversial Catechism, as
   published by the 'Catholic Publishing Company,' New Bond Street,
   London, the pretended doctrine of papal infallibility was expressly
   denied as 'a Protestant invention; it is no article of the Catholic
   faith; no decision of the Pope can oblige under pain of heresy, unless
   it be received and enforced by the teaching body, that is, by the
   Bishops of the Church.' But since 1871 the leaf containing this
   question and answer has been canceled and another substituted. So says
   Oxenham, in his translation of Döllinger on the Reunion of Churches, p.
   126, note. The same is true of many German and French Catholic
   Catechisms.

   The remaining doctrinal decrees of the Roman Church relate to internal
   controversies among different schools of Roman Catholics.

   Jansenism, so called after Cornelius Jansenius (or Jansen), Bishop of
   Ypres, and supported by the genius, learning, and devout piety of some
   of the noblest minds of France, as St. Cyran, Arnauld, Nicole, Pascal,
   Tillemont, the Mother Angelique Arnauld, and other nuns of the once
   celebrated Cistercian convent Port-Royal des Champs (a few miles from
   Versailles), was an earnest attempt at a conservative doctrinal and
   disciplinary reformation in the Roman Church by reviving the
   Augustinian views of sin and grace, against the semi-Pelagian doctrines
   and practices of Jesuitism, and made a near approach to evangelical
   Protestantism, though remaining sincerely Roman Catholic in its
   churchly, sacerdotal, and sacramental spirit, and legalistic, ascetic
   piety. It was most violently opposed and almost totally suppressed by
   the combined power of Church and State in France, which in return
   reaped the Revolution. It called forth two Papal condemnations, with
   which we are here concerned.

   I. The bull 'Cum Occasione' of Innocent X. (who personally knew and
   cared nothing about theology), A.D. 1653. It is purely negative, and
   condemns the following five propositions from a posthumous work of
   Jansenius, entitled Augustinus. [199]

   (1.) The fulfillment of some precepts of God is impossible even to just
   men according to their present ability (secundum præsentes quas habent
   vires), and the grace is also wanting to them by which they could be
   observed (deest illis gratia, qua possibilia fiant).

   (2.) Interior grace is never resisted in the state of fallen nature.

   (3.) For merit or demerit in the state of fallen nature man need not be
   exempt from all necessity, but only from coercion or constraint (Ad
   merendum et demerendum in statu naturæ lapsæ, non requiritur in homine
   libertas a necessitate, sed sufficit libertas a coactione--that is,
   from violence and natural necessity).

   (4.) The Semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity of prevenient interior
   grace for every action, even for the beginning of faith; but they were
   heretical (in eo erant hæretici) in believing this grace to be such as
   could be resisted, or obeyed by the human will (eam gratiam talem esse,
   cui posset humana voluntas resistere, vel obtemperare).

   (5.) It is semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died and shed his blood
   wholly (altogether) for all men. [200]

   The Jansenists maintained that these propositions were not taught by
   Jansenius, at least not in the sense in which they were condemned; that
   this was a historical question of fact (question de fait), not a
   dogmatic question of right (droit); and, while conceding to the Pope
   the right to condemn heretical propositions, they denied his
   infallibility in deciding a question of fact, about which he might be
   misinformed, ignorant, prejudiced, or taken by surprise.

   But Pope Alexander VII., in a bull of 1665, commanded all the
   Jansenists to subscribe a formula of submission to the bull of Innocent
   X., with the declaration that the five propositions were taught in the
   book of Cornelius Jansen in the sense in which they were condemned by
   the previous Pope. [201]

   The Jansenists, including the nuns of Port-Royal, refused to submit.
   Many fled to the Netherlands. The Pope abolished their famous convent
   (1709), the building was destroyed by order of Louis XIV. (1710), even
   the corpses of the illustrious Tillemonts, Arnaulds, Nicoles, De Sacys,
   and others, were disinterred with gross brutality (1711), and the
   church itself was demolished (1713). No wonder that such barbarous
   tyranny and cruelty, perpetrated in the holy name of the Church of
   Christ, bred a generation of skeptics and infidels, who at last
   banished the Church and religion itself from the territory of France.
   Cardinal Noailles, who from weakness had lent his high authority to
   these outrages, made afterwards, in bitter repentance, a pilgrimage to
   the ruins of Port-Royal, and, looking over the desecrated
   burial-ground, he exclaimed: 'Oh! all these dismantled stones will rise
   up against me at the day of judgment! Oh! how shall I ever bear the
   vast, the heavy load!' [202]

   II. The more important bull 'Unigenitus (Dei Filius)', issued by Pope
   Clement XI., Sept., 1713, condemns one hundred and one sentences of the
   Jansenist Pasquier Quesnel, (d. 1719), extracted from his moral
   reflections on the New Testament. [203]

   This bull is likewise negative, but commits the Church of Rome still
   more strongly than the former against evangelical doctrines. Several of
   the passages selected are found almost literally in Augustine and St.
   Paul; they assert the total depravity of human nature, the loss of
   liberty, the renewing power of the free grace of God in Christ, the
   right and duty of all Christians to read the Bible.

   The following are the most important of these propositions: [204]

   (2.) Jesu Christi gratia, principium efficax boni cujuscunque generis,
   necessaria est ad omne opus bonum; absque illa non solum nihil fit, sed
   nec fieri potest.

   (3.) In vanum, Domine, præcipis, si tu ipse non das, quod præcipis.
   (Compare the similar sentence of Augustine, which was so offensive to
   Pelagius: Da quod jubes, et jube quod vis.)

   (4.) Ita, Domine; omnia possibilia sunt ei, cui omnia possibilia facis,
   eadem operando in illo.

   (10.) Gratia est operatio manus omnipotentis Dei, quam nihil impedire
   potest aut retardare.

   (11.) Gratia non est aliud quam voluntas omnipotentis Dei jubentis et
   facientis, quod jubet.

   (13.) Quando Deus vult animam salvam facere, et eam tangit interiori
   gratiæ suæ manu, nulla voluntas humana ei resistit.

   (18.) Semen verbi, quod manus Dei irrigat, semper affert fructum suum.

   (21.) Gratia Jesu Christi est gratia fortis, potens, suprema,
   invincibilis, utpote quæ est operatio voluntatis omnipotentis, sequela
   et imitatio operationis Dei incarnantis et resuscitantis Filium suum.

   (27.) Fides est prima gratia et fons omnium aliarum. (2 Pet. 1. 3.)

   (28.) Prima gratia, quam Deus concedit peccatori, est peccatorum
   remissio.

   (29.) Extra ecclesiam nulla conceditur gratia. [205]

   (30.) Omnes, quos Deus vult salvare per Christum, salvantur
   infallibiliter.

   (38.) Peccator non est liber, nisi ad malum, sine gratia Liberatoris.

   (39.) Voluntas, quam gratia non prævenit, nihil habet luminis, nisi ad
   aberrandum, ardoris, nisi ad se præcipitandum, virium nisi ad se
   vulnerandum; est capax omnis mali et incapax ad omne bonum.

   (40.) Sine gratia nihil amare possumus, nisi ad nostram condemnationem.

   (58.) Nec Deus est nec religio, ubi non est charitas. (1 John iv. 8.)

   (59.) Oratio impiorum est novum peccatum; et quod Deus illis concedit,
   est novum in eos judicium.

   (69.) Fides, usus, augmentum et præmium fidei, totum est donum puræ
   liberalitatis Dei.

   (72.) Nota ecclesiæ Christianæ est, quod sit catholica, comprehendens
   et omnes angelos coeli, et omnes electos et justos terræ et omnium
   sæculorum.

   (75.) Ecclesia est unus solus homo compositus ex pluribus membris,
   quorum Christus est caput, vita, subsistentia et persona; unus solus
   Christus compositus ex pluribus sanctis, quorum est Sanctificator.

   (76.) Nihil spatiosius Ecclesia Dei; quia omnes electi et justi omnium

   These and similar propositions, some of them one-sided and exaggerated,
   many of them clearly patristic and biblical, are indiscriminately
   condemned by the bull Unigenitus, as 'false, captious, ill-sounding,
   offensive to pious ears, scandalous, rash, injurious, seditious,
   impious, blasphemous, suspected of heresy and savoring of heresy
   itself, near akin to heresy, several times condemned, and manifestly
   renewing various heresies, particularly those which are contained in
   the infamous propositions of Jansenius!'

   A large portion of the French clergy, headed by the Archbishop of
   Paris, Cardinal de Noailles, who repented of his part in the
   destruction of Port-Royal, protested against the bull, and appealed
   from the Pope to a future council. But 'when Rome has spoken, the cause
   is finished.' The bull Unigenitus was repeatedly confirmed by the same
   Clement XI., A.D. 1718 (in the bull 'Pastoralis Officii'), Innocent
   XIII., 1722, Benedict XIII. and a Roman Synod, 1725, Benedict XIV.,
   1756; it was accepted by the Gallican clergy 1730, and, as Denzinger
   says, by 'the whole Catholic world' ('ab universo mundo catholico').
   Even the miracles on the grave of a Jansenist saint (Franois Paris, who
   died 1727, after the severest self-denial, with a protest against the
   bull Unigenitus in his hand), could not save Jansenism from destruction
   in France. [206]

   But a remnant fled to the more liberal soil of Protestant Holland, and
   was there preserved as a perpetual testimony against Jesuitism, and, as
   it now seems, for an important mission in connection with the Old
   Catholic protest against the decisions of the Vatican Council.

   Note on the Jansenists in Holland.--The remnant of the Jansenists or
   the Old Catholics in Holland date their separate existence from the
   protest against the bull Unigenitus, but are properly the descendants
   of the original Catholics. They disown the name 'Jansenists,' on the
   ground of alleged error in the papal bulls concerning the true teaching
   of Jansen, and call themselves the 'Old Episcopal Clergy of the
   Netherlands;' but they are strongly opposed to the theology and
   casuistry of the Jesuits, and incline to the Augustinian views of sin
   and grace. In other respects they are good Catholics in doctrine,
   worship, and mode of piety; they acknowledge the decrees and canons of
   Trent, and even the supremacy of the Pope within the limits of the old
   Gallican theory. They inform him of the election of every new bishop,
   which the Pope as regularly declares illegitimate, null, and void. They
   say that the tyranny of a father does not absolve his children from the
   duty of obedience, and hope against hope that God will convert the
   Pope, and turn his heart towards them. They number at present one
   archbishopric of Utrecht and two bishoprics of Deventer and Haarlem, 25
   congregations, and about 6000 members. They live very quietly,
   surrounded by Romanists and Protestants, and are much respected, like
   the Moravians, for their character and piety. The Pope, after
   condemning them over and over again, appointed, in 1853, five new
   bishoprics in Holland, with a rival archbishop at Utrecht, and thus
   consolidated and perpetuated the schism. When the decree of the
   Immaculate Conception was promulgated in 1854, the three Old Catholic
   Bishops issued a pastoral letter, in which they reject the new dogma as
   contrary to the Scriptures and early tradition, and as lacking the
   threefold test of catholicity (semper, ubique, ab omnibus). The Vatican
   decree of Papal Infallibility, and the Old Catholic movement in Germany
   have brought this long afflicted and persecuted remnant of Jansenism
   into new notice. The Old Catholics of Germany, holding fast to an
   unbroken episcopal succession, looked to their brethren in Holland for
   aid in effecting an organization when it should become necessary. At
   their invitation, Archbishop Loos, of Utrecht (a venerable and amiable
   old gentleman), made a tour of visitation in the summer of 1872, and
   confirmed about five hundred children in several congregations in
   Germany, blessing God that his little Church was spared for happier
   days. After his death the Bishop of Deventer consecrated Prof. Reinkens
   Bishop for the Old Catholics in Germany, Aug. 11, 1873. The Old
   Catholics of Holland agree with those in Germany:  1. In maintaining
   the doctrinal basis of Tridentine Romanism;  2. In protesting against
   all subsequent papal decisions, more particularly the bull Unigenitus,
   the decree of the Immaculate Conception (1854), and the Vatican decree
   of Papal Infallibility. [The Jansenist Abp. of Utrecht was
   excommunicated by Leo XIII., Feb. 28, 1893. See Mirbt, p. 488, and also
   the Old Catholic bishops of Germany and Switzerland.--Ed.]

   such men as Fénelon, among the brightest and holiest of those who owned
   the authority of Rome. Thus was the train laid which led to the fearful
   explosion in which altar and throne alike fell, and atheism was
   nationally embraced. How the mind of Voltaire was affected by the
   abominable deeds of men who professed the name of Christ, is shown by
   his juvenile verses, in which he speaks so indignantly of the
   destruction of Port-Royal that he was sent for a year to the Bastile.'

   edited the works of Leo I. (1675, with dissertations) in defense of the
   Gallican Church against the Ultramontane Papacy (hence the edition was
   condemned by the Congregation of the Index), was exiled from France
   1684, joined Arnauld at Brussels, and died at Amsterdam 1719. After the
   death of Arnauld he was considered the head of the Jansenists. His
   commentary is one of the most spiritual and reverent. It is entitled

   vers, et pour en rendre la lecture plus utile, et la méditation plus

   [205] The denial of this proposition implies the assertion that there
   is grace outside of the Church, though not sufficient for salvation;
   else it would be inconsistent with the Roman Catholic doctrine 'Extra
   ecclesiam nulla salus.'

   and ecstatic convulsions to the devil.

   The first step towards the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate
   Conception of the Virgin Mary, which exempts her from all contact with
   sin and guilt, was taken by Pope Pius IX., himself a most devout
   worshiper of Mary, during his temporary exile at Gaäta. In an
   encyclical letter, dated Feb. 2, 1849, he invited the opinion of the
   Bishops on the alleged ardent desire of the Catholic world that the
   Apostolic See should, by some solemn judgment, define the Immaculate
   Conception, and thus secure signal blessings to the Church in these
   evil times. For, he added, 'You know full well, venerable brethren,
   that the whole ground of our confidence is placed in the most holy
   Virgin,' since 'God has vested in her the plenitude of all good, so
   that henceforth, if there be in us any hope, if there be any grace, if
   there be any salvation (si quid spei in nobis est, si quid gratiæ, si
   quid salutis), we must receive it solely from her, according to the
   will of him who would have us possess all through Mary.'

   More than six hundred Bishops answered, all of them, with the exception
   of four, assenting to the Pope's belief, but fifty-two, among them
   distinguished German and French Bishops, dissenting from the expediency
   or opportuneness of the proposed dogmatic definition. The Archbishop of
   Paris (Sibour) apprehended injury to the Catholic faith from the
   unnecessary definition of the Immaculate Conception, which 'could be
   proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition, and to which
   reason and science raised insolvable, or at least inextricable,
   difficulties.' But this opposition was drowned in the general current.
   [207]

   After the preliminary labors of a special commission of Cardinals and
   theologians, and a consistory of consultation, Pope Pius, in virtue of
   the authority of Christ and the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and his
   own authority, solemnly proclaimed the dogma on the Feast of the
   Conception, Dec. 8, 1854, in the Church of St. Peter, in the presence
   of over two hundred Cardinals, Bishops, and other dignitaries, invited
   by him, not to discuss the doctrine, but simply to give additional
   solemnity to the ceremony of proclamation. After the mass and the
   singing of the Veni Creator Spiritus, he read with a tremulous voice
   the concluding formula of the bull 'Ineffabilis Deus,' declaring it to
   be a divinely revealed fact and dogma, which must be firmly and
   constantly believed by all the faithful on pain of excommunication,
   'that the most blessed Virgin Mary, in the first moment of her
   conception, by a special grace and privilege of Almighty God, in virtue
   of the merits of Christ, was preserved immaculate from all stain of
   original sin.' [208]

   The shouts of the assembled multitude, the cannons of St. Angelo, the
   chime of all the bells, the illumination of St. Peter's dome, the
   splendor of gorgeous feasts, responded to the decree. Rome was
   intoxicated with idolatrous enthusiasm, and the whole Roman Catholic
   world thrilled with joy over the crowning glory of the immaculate queen
   of heaven, who would now be more gracious and powerful in her
   intercession than ever, and shower the richest blessings upon the Pope
   and his Church. To perpetuate the memory of the occasion, the Pope
   caused a bronze tablet to be placed in the wall of the choir of St.
   Peter's, with the inscription that, on the 8th of December, 1854, he
   proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Deipara Virgo
   Maria, and thereby fulfilled the desire of the whole Catholic world
   (totius orbis catholici desideria), and a pompous marble statue of the
   Virgin to be erected on the Piazza di Spagnia, facing the palace of the
   Propaganda, and representing the Virgin in the attitude of blessing,
   with Moses, David, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, as the prophetic witnesses of
   her conception, at the foot of the column. [209] He ordered, also,
   through the Congregation of Rites, the preparation of a new mass and a
   new office for the festival of the Conception, which was published
   Sept. 25, 1863, and contains the prayer: 'O God, who, by the immaculate
   conception of the Virgin, didst prepare a worthy dwelling for thy Son:
   grant, we beseech thee, that, as thou didst preserve her from every
   stain, in anticipation of the death of thy Son, so we also may, through
   her intercession, appear purified before thy presence.'

   The dogma lacks the sanction of an oecumenical Council, and rests
   solely on the authority of the Pope, who, in its proclamation,
   virtually anticipated his own infallibility; but it has been generally
   accepted by subsequent assent, and must be considered as an essential
   and undoubted part of the Roman faith, especially since the Vatican
   Council has declared the official infallibility of the Pope.

   This extraordinary dogma lifts the Virgin Mary out of the fallen and
   redeemed race of Adam, and places her on a par with the Saviour. For if
   she is really free from all hereditary as well as actual sin and guilt,
   she is above the need of redemption. Repentance, forgiveness,
   regeneration, conversion, sanctification are as inapplicable to her as
   to Christ himself. The definition of such a dogma implies nothing less
   than a Divine revelation; for only the omniscient God can know the fact
   of the immaculate conception, and only he can reveal it. He did not
   reveal it to the inspired Apostles, nor to the Fathers. Did he reveal
   it to Pope Pius IX., in 1854, more than eighteen centuries after it
   took place?

   Viewed from the Roman point of view, the new dogma is the legitimate
   fruit of the genuine spirit of modern Romanism. It only completes that
   Mariology, and fortifies that Mariolatry, which is the very soul of its
   piety and public worship. We may almost call Romanism the Church of the
   Virgin Mary--not of the real Virgin of the Gospels, who sits humbly and
   meekly at the feet of her and our Lord and Saviour in heaven, but of
   the apocryphal Virgin of the imagination, which assigns her a throne
   high above angels and saints. This mythical Mary is the popular
   expression of the Romish idea of the Church, and absorbs all the
   reverence and affection of the heart. Her worship overshadows even the
   worship of Christ. His perfect humanity, by which he comes much nearer
   to us than his earthly mother, is almost forgotten. She, the lovely,
   gentle, compassionate woman, stands in front; her Son, over whom she is
   supposed still to exercise the rights of her divine maternity, is
   either the stern Lord behind the clouds, or rests as a smiling infant
   on her supporting arms. By her powerful intercession she is the
   fountain of all grace. She is virtually put in the place of the Holy
   Spirit, and made the mediatrix between Christ and the believer. She is
   most frequently approached in prayer, and the 'Ave Maria' is to the
   Catholic what the Lord's Prayer is to the Protestant. If she hears all
   the petitions which from day to day, and from hour to hour, rise up to
   her from many millions in every part of the globe, she must, to all
   intents and purposes, be omnipresent and omniscient. She is the
   favorite subject of Roman painters, who represent her as blending in
   harmony the spotless beauty of the Virgin and the tender care of the
   mother, and as the crowned queen of heaven. Every event of her life,
   known or unknown, even her alleged bodily assumption to heaven, is
   celebrated with special zeal by a public festival. [210] It is almost
   incredible to what extent Romish books of devotion exalt the Virgin. In
   the Middle Ages the whole Psalter was rewritten and made to sing her
   praises, as 'The heavens declare thy glory, O Mary;' 'Offer unto our
   lady, ye sons of God, praise and reverence!' In St. Liguori's much
   admired and commended 'Glories of Mary,' she is called 'our life,' the
   'hope of sinners,' 'an advocate mighty to save all,' a 'peacemaker
   between sinners and God.' There is scarcely an epithet of Christ which
   is not applied to her. According to Pope Pius IX., 'Mary has crushed
   the head of the serpent,' i.e., destroyed the power of Satan, 'with her
   immaculate foot!' Around her name clusters a multitude of pious and
   blasphemous legends, superstitions, and impostures of wonder-working
   pictures, eye-rotations, and other unnatural marvels; even the cottage
   in which she lived was transported by angels through the air, across
   land and sea, from Nazareth in Galilee to Loretto in Italy; and such a
   silly legend was soberly and learnedly defended even in our days by a
   Roman Archbishop. [211]

   Romanism stands and falls with Mariolatry and Papal Infallibility;
   while Protestantism stands and falls with the worship of Christ as the
   only Mediator between God and man, and the all-sufficient Advocate with
   the Father.

   [209] The statue of the Virgin is said to have come out of the Roman
   fabric with a hideous crack, which was clumsily patched up. See Hase,
   Protest. Polemik, 3d ed. p. 341, and Preuss, l.c. p. 197 (English
   edition).

   [210] Why should the fiction of the Assumption of Mary to heaven (as it
   is called in distinction from the Ascension of Christ) not be
   proclaimed a divinely revealed fact and a binding dogma, as well as the
   Immaculate Conception? The evidence is about the same. If Mary was free
   from all contact with sin, she can not have been subject to death and
   corruption, which are the wages of sin. The silence of the Bible
   concerning her end might be turned to good account. Tradition, also,
   can be produced in favor of the assumption. St. Jerome was inclined to
   believe it, and even the great Augustine 'feared to say that the
   blessed body, in which Christ had been incarnate, could become food for
   the worms.' The festival of the Assumption, which presupposes the
   popular superstition, is older than the festival of the Immaculate
   Conception, and is traced by some to the fifth or sixth century.

   § 29. The Argument for the Immaculate Conception.

   The importance of the subject justifies and demands a brief examination
   of the arguments in favor of this novel dogma, which is one of the most
   characteristic features of modern Romanism, and forms an impassable
   gulf between it and Protestantism. It is a striking proof of Romish
   departure from the truth, and of the anti-Christian presumption of the
   Pope, who declared it to be a primitive divine revelation; while it is
   in fact a superstitious fiction of the dark ages, contrary alike to the
   Scriptures and to genuine Catholic tradition.

   1. The dogma of the sinlessness of the Virgin Mary is unscriptural, and
   even anti-scriptural.

   (a) The Scripture passages which Perrone and other champions of the
   Immaculate Conception adduce are, with one exception, all taken from
   the Old Testament, and based either on false renderings of the Latin
   Bible, or on fanciful allegorical interpretation.

   (1) The main (and, according to Perrone, the only) support is derived
   from the protevangelium, Gen. iii. 15, where Jehovah Elohim says to the
   serpent, according to the Latin Bible (which the Romish Church has
   raised to an equality with the original): 'Inimicitias ponam inter te
   et mulierem, et semen tuum et semen illius; Ipsa conteret caput tuum,
   et tu insidiaberis calcaneo ejus' (i.e., she shall crush thy head, and
   thou shalt assail her heel). Here the ipsa is referred to the woman
   (mulier), and understood of the Virgin Mary. [212] And it is inferred
   that the divinely constituted enmity between Mary and Satan must be
   unconditional and eternal, which would not be the case if she had ever
   been subject to hereditary sin. [213] To this corresponds the Romish
   exegesis of the fight of the woman (i.e., the Church) with the dragon,
   Rev. xii. 4 sqq.; the woman being falsely understood to mean Mary.
   Hence Romish art often represents her as crushing the head of the
   dragon.

   But the translation of the Vulgate, on which all this reasoning is
   based, is contrary to the original Hebrew, which uses the masculine
   form of the verb, he (or it, the seed of the woman), i.e., Christ,
   shall bruise, or crush, the serpent's head, i.e., destroy the devil's
   power; it is inconsistent with the last clause, 'and thou shalt bruise
   his (i.e., Christ's) heel,' which contains a mysterious allusion to the
   crucifixion of the seed, not of the woman; and, finally, the Romish
   interpretation leads to the blasphemous conclusion that Mary, and not
   Christ, has destroyed the power of Satan, and saved the human race.
   [214]

   (2) An unwarranted reference of some poetic descriptions of the fair
   and spotless bride, in the Song of Solomon, to Mary, instead of the
   people of Jehovah or the Christian Church, Cant. iv. 7, according to
   the Vulgate: 'Tota pulchra es, amica mea, et macula non est in te.' In
   any case, this is only a description of the present character.

   (3) An arbitrary allegorical interpretation of the 'garden inclosed,
   and fountain sealed,' spoken of the spouse, Cant. iv. 12 (Vulg.:
   'hortus conclusus, fons signatus'), and the closed gate in the east of
   the temple in the vision of Ezekiel, xliv. 1-3, of which it is said:
   'It shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because
   Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall
   be shut. It is for the prince; the prince he shall sit in it, to eat
   bread before the Lord.' This is a favorite support of the doctrine of
   the perpetual virginity. Ambrose of Milan (d. 397) was perhaps the
   first who found here a type of the closed womb of the Virgin, by which
   Christ entered into the world, and who added to the miracle of a
   conception sine viro the miracle of a birth clauso utero. [215] Jerome
   and other Fathers followed, and drew a parallel between the closed womb
   of the Virgin, from which Christ was born to earthly life, and the
   sealed tomb from which he arose to heavenly life. But none of the
   Fathers thought of making this prophecy prove the Immaculate
   Conception. Such exposition, or imposition rather, is an insult to the
   Bible, as well as to every principle of hermeneutics.

   (4) Sap. i. 4: 'Into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell
   in the body that is subject unto sin.' This passage (quoted by Speil
   and others), besides being from an apocryphal book, has nothing to do
   with Mary.

   (5) Luke i. 28: the angelic greeting, 'Hail (Mary), full of grace
   (gratia plena),' according to the Romish versions, says nothing of the
   origin of Mary, but refers only to her condition at the time of the
   incarnation, and is besides a mistranslation (see below).

   (b) All this frivolous allegorical trifling with the Word of God is
   conclusively set aside by the positive and uniform Scripture doctrine
   of the universal sinfulness and universal need of redemption, with the
   single exception of our blessed Saviour, who was conceived by the Holy
   Ghost without the agency of a human father. It is almost useless to
   refer to single passages, such as Rom. iii. 10, 23; v. 12, 18; 1 Cor.
   xv. 22; 2 Cor. v. 14, 15; Gal. iii. 22; Eph. ii. 3; 1 Tim. iv. 10; Psa.
   li. 5. The doctrine runs through the whole Bible, and underlies the
   entire scheme of redemption. St. Paul emphasizes the actual
   universality of the curse of Adam, in order to show the virtual
   universality of the salvation of Christ (Rom. v. 12 sqq.; 1 Cor. xv.
   22); and to insert an exception in favor of Mary would break the force
   of the argument, and limit the extent of the atonement as well. Perrone
   admits the force of these passages, but tries to escape it by saying
   that, if strictly understood, they would call in question even the
   immaculate birth of Mary, and her freedom from actual sin as well,
   which is contrary to the Catholic faith; [216] hence the Council of
   Trent has deprived these passages of all force (omnem vim ademit) of
   application to the blessed Virgin! This is putting tradition above and
   against the Word of the holy and omniscient God, and amounts to a
   concession that the dogma is extra-scriptural and anti-scriptural.
   Unfortunately for Rome, Mary herself has made the application; for she
   calls God her Saviour (Luke i. 47: epi to theo to soteri mou), and
   thereby includes herself in the number of the redeemed. With this
   corresponds also the proper meaning of the predicate applied to her by
   the angel, Luke i. 28, kecharitomene, highly favored, endued with grace
   (die begnadigte), the one who received, and therefore needed, grace
   (non ut mater gratiæ, sed ut filia gratiæ, as Bengel well observes);
   comp. ver. 30, heures charin para to theo, thou hast found grace with
   God; and Eph. i. 6, echaritosen hemas, he bestowed grace upon us. But
   the Vulgate changed the passive meaning into the active: gratia plena,
   full of grace, and thus furnished a spurious argument for an error.

   Nothing can be more truthful, chaste, delicate, and in keeping with
   womanly humility and modesty than both the words and the silence of the
   canonical Gospels concerning the blessed among women, whom yet our Lord
   himself, in prophetic foresight and warning against future Mariolatry,
   placed on a level with other disciples; emphatically asserting that
   there is a still higher blessedness of spiritual kinship than that of
   carnal consanguinity. Great is the glory of Mary--the mother of Jesus,
   the ideal of womanhood, the type of purity, obedience, meekness, and
   humility--but greater, infinitely greater is the glory of Christ--the
   perfect God-man--'the glory of the only-begotten of the Father, full of
   grace (pleres charitos not kecharitomenos) and of truth.'

   2. The dogma of the sinlessness of Mary is also uncatholic. It lacks
   every one of the three marks of true catholicity, according to the
   canon of Vincentius Lirinensis, which is professedly recognized by Rome
   herself (the semper, the ubique, and the ab omnibus), and instead of a
   'unanimous consent' of the Fathers in its favor, there is a unanimous
   silence, or even protest, of the Fathers against it. For more than ten
   centuries after the Apostles it was not dreamed of, and when first
   broached as a pious opinion, it was strenuously opposed, and continued
   to be opposed till 1854 by many of the greatest saints and divines of
   the Roman Church, including St. Bernard and St. Thomas Aquinas, and
   several Popes.

   The ante-Nicene Fathers, far from teaching that Mary was free from
   hereditary sin, do not even expressly exempt her from actual sin,
   certainly not from womanly weakness and frailty. Irenæus (d. 202), who
   first suggested the fruitful parallel of Eve as the mother of
   disobedience, and Mary as the mother of obedience (not justified by the
   true Scripture parallel between Adam and Christ), and thus prepared the
   way for a false Mariology, does yet not hesitate to charge Mary with
   'unseasonable haste' or 'urgency,' which the Lord had to rebuke at the
   wedding of Cana (fcJohn ii. 4); [217] and even Chrysostom, at the close
   of the fourth century, ventured to say that she was immoderately
   ambitious, and wanting in proper regard for the glory of Christ on that
   occasion. [218] The last charge is hardly just, for in the words,
   'Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it,' she shows the true spirit of
   obedience and absolute trust in her Divine Son. Tertullian implicates
   her in the unbelief of the brethren of Jesus. [219] Origen thinks that
   she took offense, like the Apostles, at our Lord's sufferings, else 'he
   did not die for her sins;' and, according to Basil, she, too, 'wavered
   at the time of the crucifixion.' Gregory of Nazianzus, and John of
   Damascus, the last of the great Greek Fathers, teach that she was
   sanctified by the Holy Ghost; which has no meaning for a sinless being.

   The first traces of the Romish Mariolatry and Mariology are found in
   the apocryphal Gospels of Gnostic and Ebionitic origin. [220] In marked
   contrast with the canonical Gospels, they decorate the life of Mary
   with marvelous fables, most of which have passed into the Roman Church,
   and some also into the Mohammedan Koran and its commentaries. [221]

   Mariolatry preceded the Romish Mariology. Each successive step in the
   excessive veneration (hyperdulia) of the Virgin, and each festival
   memorializing a certain event in her life, was followed by a progress
   in the doctrine concerning Mary and her relation to Christ and the
   believer. The theory only justified and explained a practice already
   existing.

   The Mariology of the Roman Catholic Church has passed through three
   stages: the perpetual virginity of Mary, her freedom from actual sin,
   and her freedom from hereditary sin.

   This progress in Mariolatry is strikingly reflected in the history of
   Christian art. 'The first pictures of the early Christian ages simply
   represent the woman. By-and-by we find outlines of the mother and the
   child. In an after-age the Son is sitting upon a throne, with the
   mother crowned, but sitting as yet below him. In an age still later,
   the crowned mother on a level with the Son. Later still, the mother on
   a throne above the Son. And lastly, a Romish picture represents the
   eternal Son in wrath, about to destroy the earth, and the Virgin
   Intercessor interposing, pleading, by significant attitude, her
   maternal rights, and redeeming the world from his vengeance. Such was,
   in fact, the progress of Virgin-worship. First the woman reverenced for
   the Son's sake; then the woman reverenced above the Son, and adored.'

   (1) The idea of the perpetual Virginity of Mary was already current in
   the ante-Nicene age, and spread in close connection with the ascetic
   overestimate of celibacy, and the rise of monasticism. It has a
   powerful hold even over many Protestant minds, on grounds of religious
   propriety. Tertullian, who died about 220, still held that Mary bore
   children to Joseph after the birth of Christ. But towards the close of
   the fourth century the denial of her perpetual virginity (by the
   Antidicomarianites, by Helvidius and Jovinian) was already treated as a
   profane and indecent heresy by Epiphanius in the Greek, and Jerome in
   the Latin Church. Hence the hypothesis that the brethren and sisters of
   Jesus, so often mentioned in the Gospels, were either children of
   Joseph by a former marriage (Epiphanius), or only cousins of Jesus
   (Jerome). On the other hand, however, the same Epiphanius places among
   his eighty heresies the Mariolatry of the Collyridianæ, a company of
   women in Arabia, in the last part of the fourth century, who sacrificed
   to Mary little cakes or loaves of bread (kolluris, hence the name
   Kolluridianoi), and paid her divine honor with festive rites similar to
   those connected with the cult of Cybele, the magna mater deûm, in
   Arabia and Phrygia.

   (2) The freedom of Mary from actual sin was first clearly taught in the
   fifth century by Augustine and Pelagius, who, notwithstanding their
   antagonism on the doctrines of sin and grace, agreed in this point, as
   they did also in their high estimate of asceticism and monasticism.
   Augustine, for the sake of Christ's honor, exempted Mary from willful
   contact with actual sin; [222] but he expressly included her in the
   fall of Adam and its hereditary consequences. [223] Pelagius, who
   denied hereditary sin, went further, and exempted Mary (with several
   other saints of the Old Testament) from sin altogether; [224] and, if
   he were not a condemned heretic, he might be quoted as the father of
   the modern dogma. [225] The view which came to prevail in the Catholic
   Church was that Mary, though conceived in sin, like David and all men,
   was sanctified in the womb, like Jeremiah (i. 5) and John the Baptist
   (Luke i. 15), and thus prepared to be the spotless receptacle for the
   Son of God and Saviour of mankind. Many, however, held that she was not
   fully sanctified till she conceived the Saviour by the Holy Ghost. The
   extravagant praise lavished on 'the Mother of God' by the Fathers after
   the defeat of Nestorianism (431), and the frequent epithets most holy
   and immaculate (panagia, immaculata and immaculatissima), refer only to
   her spotless purity of character after her sanctification, but not to
   her conception. [226] The Greek Church goes as far as the Roman in the
   practice of Mariolatry, but rejects the dogma of the Immaculate
   Conception as subversive of the Incarnation. [227]

   (3) The third step, which exempts Mary from original sin as well, is of
   much later origin. It meets us first as a pious opinion in connection
   with the festival of the Conception of Mary, which was fixed upon Dec.
   8, nine months before the older festival of her birth (celebrated Sept.
   8). This festival was introduced by the Canons at Lyons in France, Dec.
   8, 1139, and gradually spread into England and other countries.
   Although it was at first intended to be the festival of the Conception
   of the immaculate Mary, it concealed the doctrine of the Immaculate
   Conception, since every ecclesiastical solemnity acknowledges the
   sanctity of its object.

   For this reason, Bernard of Clairvaux, 'the honey-flowing doctor'
   doctor mellifluus), and greatest saint of his age, who, by a voice
   mightier than the Pope's, roused Europe to the second crusade, opposed
   the festival as a false honor to the royal Virgin, which she does not
   need, and as an unauthorized innovation, which was the mother of
   temerity, the sister of superstition, and the daughter of levity. [228]
   He urged against it that it was not sanctioned by the Roman Church. He
   rejected the opinion of the Immaculate Conception of Mary as contrary
   to tradition and derogatory to the dignity of Christ, the only sinless
   being, and asked the Canons of Lyons the pertinent question, 'Whence
   they discovered such a hidden fact? On the same ground they might
   appoint festivals for the conception of the parents, grandparents, and
   great-grandparents of Mary, and so on without end.' [229] It does not
   diminish, but rather increases (for the Romish stand-point) the weight
   of his protest, that he was himself an enthusiastic eulogist of Mary,
   and a believer in her sinless birth. He put her in this respect on a
   par with Jeremiah and John the Baptist. [230]

   The same ground was taken substantially by the greatest schoolmen of
   the Middle Ages till the beginning of the fourteenth century: Anselm of
   Canterbury (d. 1109), who closely followed Augustine; [231] Peter the
   Lombard, 'the Master of Sentences' (d. 1161); Alexander of Hales, 'the
   irrefragable doctor' (d. 1245); St. Bonaventura, 'the seraphic doctor'
   (d. 1274); Albertus Magnus, 'the wonderful doctor' (d. 1280); St.
   Thomas Aquinas, 'the angelic doctor' (d. 1274), and the very champion
   of orthodoxy, followed by the whole school of Thomists and the order of
   the Dominicans. St. Thomas taught that Mary was conceived from sinful
   flesh in the ordinary way, secundum carnis concupiscentiam ex
   commixtione maris, and was sanctified in the womb after the infusion of
   the soul (which is called the passive conception); for otherwise she
   would not have needed the redemption of Christ, and so Christ would not
   be the Saviour of all men. He distinguishes, however, three grades in
   the sanctification of the Blessed Virgin: first, the sanctificatio in
   utero, by which she was freed from the original guilt (culpa
   originalis); secondly, the sanctificatio in conceptu Domini, when the
   Holy Ghost overshadowed her, whereby she was totally purged (totaliter
   mundata) from the fuel or incentive to sin (fomes peccati); and,
   thirdly, the sanctificatio in morte, by which she was freed from all
   consequences of sin (liberata ab omni miseria). Of the festival of the
   Conception, he says that it was not observed, but tolerated by the
   Church of Rome, and, like the festival of the Assumption, was not to be
   entirely rejected (non totaliter reprobanda). [232] The University of
   Paris, which during the Middle Ages was regarded as the third power in
   Europe, gave the weight of its authority for a long time to the
   doctrine of the Maculate Conception. Even seven Popes are quoted on the
   same side, and among them three of the greatest, viz., Leo I. (who says
   that Christ alone was free from original sin, and that Mary obtained
   her purification through her conception of Christ), Gregory I., and
   Innocent III. [233]

   But a change in favor of the opposite view was brought about, in the
   beginning of the fourteenth century, by Duns Scotus, 'the subtle
   doctor' (d. 1308), who attacked the system of St. Thomas and the
   Augustinian doctrine of original sin, who delighted in the most
   abstruse questions and the most intricate problems, to show the skill
   of his acute dialectics, and who could twist a disagreeable text into
   its opposite meaning. He was the first schoolman of distinction who
   advocated the Immaculate Conception, first at Oxford, though very
   cautiously, as a possible and probable fact. [234] He refuted,
   according to a doubtful tradition, the opposite theory, in a public
   disputation at Paris, with no less than two hundred arguments, and
   converted the University to his view. [235] At all events, he made it a
   distinctive tenet of his order.

   Henceforward the Immaculate Conception became an apple of discord
   between rival schools of Thomists and Scotists, and the rival orders of
   the Dominicans and Franciscans. They charged each other with heresy,
   and even with mortal sin for holding the one view or the other.
   Visions, marvelous fictions, weeping pictures of Mary, and letters from
   heaven were called in to help the argument for or against a fact which
   no human being, not even Mary herself, can know without a divine
   revelation. Four Dominicans, who were discovered in a pious fraud
   against the Franciscan doctrine, were burned, by order of a papal
   court, in Berne, on the eve of the Reformation. The Swedish prophetess,
   St. Birgitte, was assured in a vision by the Mother of God that she was
   conceived without sin; while St. Catharine of Siena prophesied for the
   Dominicans that Mary was sanctified in the third hour after her
   conception. So near came the contending parties that the difference,
   though very important as a question of principle, was practically
   narrowed down to a question of a few hours. The Franciscan view
   gradually gained ground. The University of Paris, the Spanish nation,
   and the Council of Basle (1439) favored it. Pope Sixtus IV., himself a
   Franciscan, gave his sanction and blessing to the festival of the
   Immaculate Conception, but threatened with excommunication all those of
   both parties who branded the one or the other doctrine as a heresy and
   mortal sin, since the Roman Church had not yet decided the question
   (1476 and 1483).

   The Council of Trent (June 17, 1546) confirmed this neutral position,
   but with a leaning to the Franciscan side, by adding to the dogma on
   original sin the caution that it was not intended 'to comprehend in
   this decree the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary.' [236] Pius V.
   (1570), a Dominican, condemned Baius (De Bay, Professor at Louvain, and
   a forerunner of the Jansenists), who held that Mary had actual as well
   as original sin; but soon afterwards he ordered that the discussion of
   this delicate question should be confined to scholars in the Latin
   tongue, and not be brought to the pulpit or among the people. In the
   mean time the Franciscan doctrine was taken up and advocated with great
   zeal and energy by the Jesuits. At first they felt their way
   cautiously. Bellarmin declared the Immaculate Conception to be a pious
   and probable opinion, more probable than the opposite. In 1593 the
   fifth general assembly of the order directed its teachers to depart
   from St. Thomas in this article, and to defend the doctrine of Scotus,
   'which was then more common and more accepted among theologians.' It is
   chiefly through their influence that it gained ground more and more,
   yet under constant opposition. Paul V. (1616) still left both parties
   the liberty to advocate their opinion; but a decree of the Congregation
   of the Holy Inquisition and Gregory XV. (1622) prohibited the
   publication of the doctrine that Mary was conceived in sin, and removed
   from the liturgy the word sanctification with reference to Mary. Then a
   new controversy arose as to the meaning of the term immaculate; whether
   it referred to the Virgin or to her conception? To make an end to all
   dispute, Alexander VII., urged on by the King of Spain, issued a
   constitution, Dec. 8, 1661, which recommends the Immaculate Conception,
   defining it almost in the identical words of the dogma of Pius IX.
   [237]

   Nothing was left but the additional declaration that belief in this
   doctrine was necessary to salvation. 'From this time,' says Perrone,
   [238] 'every controversy and opposition to the mystery ceased, and the
   doctrine of the Immaculate Conception attained to full and quiet
   possession in the whole Catholic Church. No sincere Catholic ventured
   hereafter to utter even a sound against it, with the exception of some
   irreligious innovators, among whom Launoy occupies the first place,
   and, in these last years, George Hermes.' Thus he disposes of the
   powerful protest of Launoy, issued in 1676, fifteen years after the
   bull of Alexander VII., with irrefragable testimonies of Fathers and
   Popes; to which may be added the anonymous treatise 'Against
   Superstition,' written by Muratori, 1741, one of the most learned
   antiquarians and historians of the Roman Church. But Jansenism was
   crushed; Jesuitism, though suppressed for a while, was restored to
   greater power; Ultramontanism and Papal Absolutism made headway over
   the decay of independent learning and research; the voice of the ablest
   remaining Catholic scholars was unheeded; the submissiveness of the
   Bishops, and the ignorance, superstition, and indifference of the
   people united in securing the triumph of the dogma.

   3. The only dogmatic argument adduced is that of congruity or fitness,
   in view of the peculiar relations which Mary sustains to the persons of
   the Holy Trinity. Being eternally chosen by the Father to be 'the bride
   of the Holy Ghost,' and 'the mother of the Son of God,' it was
   eminently proper that, from the very beginning of her existence, she
   should be entirely exempt from contact with sin and the dominion of
   Satan. [239]

   To this it is sufficient to answer that the Word of God is the highest
   and only infallible standard of religious propriety; and this standard
   concludes all men under the power of sin and death, with the only
   exception of the God-man, the sinless Redeemer of the fallen race.
   Besides, the argument of congruity can at best only prove the
   possibility of a fact, not the fact itself. And, finally, it would
   prove too much in this case; for, if propriety demands a sinless mother
   for a sinless Son, it demands also (as St. Bernard suggested) a sinless
   grandmother, great-grandmother, and an unbroken chain of sinless
   ancestors to the beginning of the race.

   On the other hand, the new dogma, viewed even from the stand-point of
   the Roman Catholic system, involves contradictory elements.

   In the first place, it is inconsistent with any proper view of original
   sin, no matter whether we adopt the theory of traducianism, or that of
   creationism (which prevails among Roman divines), or that of
   pre-existence. The bull of 1854 speaks indefinitely of the 'conception'
   of Mary. But Roman divines usually distinguish between the active
   conception, i.e., the marital act by which the seed of the body is
   formed by the agency of the parents, and the passive conception, i.e.,
   the infusion of the soul into the body by a creative act of God
   (according to the theory of creationism). [240] The meaning of the new
   dogma is that Mary, by a special grace and privilege, was exempt from
   original sin in her passive conception, that is, in that moment when
   her soul was created by God for the animation of her body. [241] Now
   original sin must come either from the body, or from the soul, or from
   both combined. If from the body, then Mary must have inherited it from
   her parents, since the dogma does not exclude these from sin; if from
   the soul, then God, who creates the soul, is the author of sin, which
   is blasphemous; if from both, then we have a combination of both these
   inextricable difficulties. Nor is the matter materially relieved if we
   take the superficial semi-Pelagian view of hereditary sin, which makes
   it a mere privation or defect, namely, the absence of the supernatural
   endowment of original righteousness and holiness (the similitudo Dei,
   as distinct from the imago Dei), instead of a positive disorder and
   sinful disposition. [242] For even in this case the same dilemma
   returns, that this original defect must have been there from the
   parents, or must be ordinarily derived from God, as the author of the
   soul, which alone can be said to possess or to lose righteousness and
   holiness. Rome must either deny original sin altogether (as Pelagius
   did), or take the further step of making the Immaculate Conception of
   Mary a strictly miraculous event, like the conception of Christ by the
   Holy Ghost, sine virili complexu and sine concupiscentia carnis.

   Secondly, the dogma, by exempting Mary from original sin in consequence
   of the merits of Christ, [243] virtually puts her under the power of
   sin; for the merits of Christ are only for sinners, and have no bearing
   upon sinless beings. Perrone, following Bellarmin, virtually concedes
   this difficulty, and vainly tries to escape it by an unmeaning figure,
   that Mary was delivered from prison before she was put into it, or that
   her debt was paid which she never contracted!

   Finally, the dogma is inconsistent with the Vatican decree of Papal
   Infallibility. The hidden fact of Mary's Immaculate Conception must, in
   the nature of the case, be a matter of divine omniscience and divine
   revelation, and is so declared in the papal decree. [244] Now it must
   have been revealed to the mind of Pius IX., or not. If not, he had no
   right, in the absence of Scripture proof, and the express dissent of
   the Fathers and the greatest schoolmen, to declare the Immaculate
   Conception a divinely revealed fact and doctrine. If it was revealed to
   him, he had no need of first consulting all the Bishops of the Roman
   Church, and waiting several years for their opinion on the subject. Or
   if this consultation was the necessary medium of such revelation, then
   he is not in himself infallible, and has no authority to define and
   proclaim any dogma of faith without the advice and consent of the
   universal Episcopate.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [212] Pope Pius IX. has given his infallible sanction to this
   misapplication of the protevangelium to Mary in the gallant phrase
   already quoted (p. 112) from his Encyclical on the dogma.

   [213] Speil, in his defense of Romanism against Hase, argues in this
   way: The woman, whom God will put in enmity against the devil, must be
   a future particular woman, over whom the devil never had any
   power--that is, a woman who, by the grace of God, was free from
   original sin (Die Lehren der katholischen Kirche, 1865, p. 165).

   [214] The Hebrew text admits of no doubt; for the verb ?yshvph, in the
   disputed clause, is masculine (he shall bruise, or crush), and hv'
   naturally refers to the preceding zrh (her seed), i.e., zrts 'sh (the
   woman's seed), and not to the more remote 'sh (woman). In the
   Pentateuch the personal pronoun hv' (he) is indeed generis communis,
   and stands also for the feminine hy' (she), which (according to the
   Masora on Gen. xxxviii. 25) is found but eleven times in the
   Pentateuch; but in all these cases the masoretic punctuators wrote hv',
   to signify that it ought to be read hy' (she). The Peshito, the
   Septuagint (autos soi teresei kephalen), and other ancient versions,
   are all right. Even some MSS. of the Vulgate read ipse for ipsa, and
   Jerome himself, the author of the Vulgate, in his 'Hebrew Questions,'
   and Pope Leo I., condemn the translation ipsa. But the blunder was
   favored by other Fathers (Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory I.), who knew no
   Hebrew, and by the monastic asceticism and fanciful chivalric
   Mariolatry of the Middle Ages. To the same influence must be traced the
   arbitrary change of the Vulgate in the rendering of shvph from conteret
   (shall bruise) into insidiaberis (shall lie in wait, assail, pursue),
   so as to exempt the Virgin from the least injury.

   [215] Epist. 42 ad Siricium; De inst. Virg., c. 8, and in his hymn A
   solis ortus cardine. The earlier Fathers thought differently on the
   subject. Tertullian calls Mary 'a virgin as to a man, but not a virgin
   as to birth' (non virgo, quantum a partu); and Epiphanius speaks of
   Christ as 'opening the mother's womb' (anoigon metran metros). See my

   make Christ the only exception.

   desired to speak with Christ while he yet talked to the people (Matt.
   xii. 46 sqq.).

   and the holy family in E. Hoffmann's Leben Jesu nach den Apocryphen,
   Leipz. 1851, pp. 5-117, and Tischendorf's De evangeliorum apocryphorum
   origine et usu, Hagæ, 1851.

   [221] It must be remembered that Mohammed derived his defective
   knowledge of Christianity from Gnostic and other heretical sources.
   Gibbon and Stanley trace the Immaculate Conception directly to the
   Koran, III. pp. 31, 37 (Rodwell's translation, p. 499), where it is
   said of Mary: 'Remember when the angel said: "Mary, verily has God
   chosen thee, and purified thee, and chosen thee above the women of the
   world."' [Pius IX., March 24, 1877, spoke of Mary as divinarum
   potentissima conciliatrix gratiarum. If possible, Leo XIII. in
   encyclicals on the rosary and other deliverances, and Pius X., went
   further in exalting Mary. Leo, Sept. 1, 1883, pronounced her 'the
   safest guide to reach the gracious hand of God,' and, Sept., 1891,
   affirmed that 'except through the Mother, it is hardly possible for any
   one to reach Christ.' On the fiftieth anniversary of the dogma of the
   immaculate conception, Oct. 17, 1904, Pius X. made astounding use of
   the Old Testament to substantiate her alleged virtues. Calling her the
   Spouse of the Holy Ghost, he announced that 'already Adam saw her in
   the distance as the destroyer of the serpent's head, and at the sight
   of her dried up his tears over the curse which had struck him'; Noah
   recalled her as he was preparing the ark; Abraham was estopped from
   sacrificing his son as he thought of her; Jacob saw her in the ladder
   on which the angels ascended and descended; Moses looked up to her at
   the burning bush; etc. Pius invoked her aid as the 'glorious helper
   against all heresies,' as Leo XIII. before had acclaimed her 'the
   glorious victor over all heretics,' and Pius XI. in his encyclical on
   Church Union, 1928. Mary, in accordance with the petition of the
   Provincial Baltimore Council, 1843, has been made by papal decree the
   'heavenly guardian of the United States,' as Pius XI. took occasion to
   remind the world when the Peace Conference met in Washington, 1921. And
   in his apostolic letter recommending the Catholic University in
   Washington, he made the petition that 'the immaculate conception may
   bestow on all America the gifts of wisdom and salvation.' Cardinal
   Gibbons, Faith of Our Fathers, p. 167, Bishop Gilmour in his Bible
   History for Catholic Schools, pp. 11, 130, and also the recent Italian
   version of the Pentateuch, issued with papal approval, repeat the false
   translation of Gen. III:15, that Mary should bruise the serpent's
   head.--ED.]

   [222] De natura et gratia, c. 36, § 42 (ed. Bened. Tom. X. p. 144):
   'Excepta sancta Virgine Maria, de qua propter honorem Domini nullam
   prorsus, cum de peccatis agitur, haberi volo quæstionem . . . hac ergo
   Virgine excepta, si omnes illos sanctos et sanctas . . . congregare
   possemus et interrogare, utrum essent sine peccato, quid fuisse
   responsuros putamus, utrum hoc quod iste [namely, Pelagius] dicit, an
   quod Joannes Apostolus (1 John i. 8)?' This is the only passage in
   Augustine which at all favors the Romanists; and the force even of this
   is partly broken by the parenthetical question: 'Unde enim scimus quid
   ei [Mariæ] plus gratiæ collatum fuerit ad vincendum omni ex parte
   peccatum quæ concipere ac parere meruit, quem constat nullum habuisse
   peccatum? For how do we know what more of grace for the overcoming of
   sin in every respect was bestowed upon her who was found worthy to
   conceive and give birth to him who, it is certain, was without sin?'
   This implies that in Mary sin was, if not a developed act, at least a
   power to be conquered.

   [223] Sermo 2 in Psalm. 34: Maria ex Adam mortua propter peccatum, et
   caro Domini ex Maria mortua propter delenda peccata; i.e., Mary died
   because of inherited sin, but Christ died for the destruction of sin.
   In his last great work, Opus imperf. contra Julian. IV. c. 122 (ed.
   Bened. X. 1208), Augustine speaks of the grace of regeneration (gratia
   renascendi) which Mary experienced. He also says explicitly that Christ
   alone was without sin, De peccat. mer. et remiss., II. c. 24, § 38 (ed.
   Bened. X. 61: Solus ille, homo factus, manens Deus, peccatum nullum
   habuit unquam, nec sumpsit carnem peccati, quamvis de materna carne
   peccati); ib. c. 35, § 57 (X. 69: Solus unus est qui sine peccato natus
   est in similitudine carnis peccati, sine peccato vixit inter aliena
   peccata, sine peccato mortuus est propter nostra peccata); De Genesi ad
   lit., c. 18, § 32; c. 20, § 35. These and other passages of Augustine
   clearly prove, to use the words of Perrone (l.c. pp. 42, 43 of the
   Germ. ed.), that 'this holy Father evidently teaches that Christ alone
   must be exempt from the general pollution of sin; but that the blessed
   Virgin, being conceived by the ordinary cohabitation of parents,
   partook of the general stain, and her flesh, being descended from sin,
   was sinful flesh, which Christ purified by assuming it.' The pupils of
   Augustine were even more explicit. One of them, Fulgentius (De incarn.
   c. 15, § 29, also quoted by Perrone), says: 'The flesh of Mary, which
   was conceived in unrighteousness in a human way, was truly sinful
   flesh.'

   [224] He says: 'Piety must confess that the mother of our Lord and
   Saviour was sinless' (as quoted by Augustine, De nat. et gratia, cc.
   36, § 42: 'quam dicit sine peccato confiteri necesse esse pietati').
   Pelagius also excludes from sin Abel, Enoch, Melchisedek, Abraham,
   Isaac, Jacob, Noah, Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, Elisha, Daniel, Ezekiel,
   John the Baptist, Deborah, Anna, Judith, Esther, Elisabeth, and Joseph,
   the husband of Mary, who 'have not only not sinned, but also lived a
   righteous life.' Julian, his ablest follower, objected to Augustine
   that, by his doctrine of hereditary sin and universal depravity, he
   handed even Mary over to the power of the devil (ipsam Mariam diabolo
   nascendi conditione transcribis); to which Augustine replied (Opus
   imperf. contra Jul. 1. IV. c. 122): 'Non transscribimus diabolo Mariam
   conditione nascendi, sed ideo quia ipsa conditio solvitur gratia
   renascendi,' i.e., because this condition (of sinful birth) is solved
   or set aside by the grace of the second birth. When this took place, he
   does not state.

   [225] It is characteristic that the Dominicans and Jansenists, who
   sympathized with the Augustinian anthropology, opposed the Immaculate
   Conception; while the Franciscans and Jesuits, who advocated it, have a
   more or less decided inclination towards Pelagianizing theories, and
   reduce original sin to a loss of supernatural righteousness, i.e.,
   something merely negative, so that it is much easier to make an
   exception in favor of Mary. The Jesuits, at least, have an intense
   hatred of Augustinian views on sin and grace, and have shown it in the
   Jansenist controversy.

   [226] The predicate immaculate was sometimes applied to other holy
   virgins, e.g., to S. Catharine of Siena, who is spoken of as la
   immaculata vergine, in a decree of that city as late as 1462. See Hase,
   l.c. p.§336.

   [227] See A. V. Mouravieff on the dogma, in Neale's Voices from the
   East, 1859, pp. 117-155.

   [228] 'Virgo regia falso non eget honore, veris cumalata honorum
   titulis. .  .  . Non est hoc Virginem honorare sed honori detraher.  .
   .  . Præsumpta novitas mater temeritatis, soror superstitionis, filia
   levitatis.' See his Epistola 174, ad Canonicos Lugdunenses, De
   conceptione S. Mar. (Op. ed. Migne, I. pp. 332-336). Comp. also
   Bernard's Sermo 78 in Cant., Op. Vol. II. pp.1160, 1162.

   [229] . . . 'et sic tenderetur in infinitum, et festorum non esset
   numerus' (Ep. 174, p. 334 sq.).

   [230] 'Si igitur ante conceptum sui sanctificari minime potuit, quoniam
   non erat; sed nec in ipso quidem conceptu, propter peccatum quod
   inerat: restat ut post conceptum in utero jam existens sanctificationem
   accepisse credatur, quæ excluso peccato sanctam fecerit nativitatem,
   non tamen et conceptionem' (l.c. p. 336).

   [231] Anselm, who is sometimes wrongly quoted on the other side, says,
   Cur Deus Homo, ii. 16 (Op. ed. Migne, I. p. 416): 'Virgo ipsa . . . est
   in iniquitatibus concepta, et in peccatis concepit eam mater ejus, et
   cum originali peccato nata est, quoniam et ipsa in Adam peccavit, in
   quo omnes peccaverunt.' To these words of Boso, Anselm replies that
   'Christ, though taken from the sinful mass (de massa peccatrice
   assumptus), had no sin.' Then he speaks of Mary twice as being purified
   from sin (mundata a peccatis) by the future death of Christ (c. 16,
   17). His pupil and biographer, Eadmer, in his book De excellent. beatæ
   Virg. Mariæ, c. 3 (Ans. Op. ed. Migne, II. pp. 560-62), says that the
   blessed Virgin was freed from all remaining stains of hereditary and
   actual sin when she consented to the announcement of the mystery of the
   Incarnation by the angel.' Quoted also by Perrone, pp. 47-49.

   [232] Summa Theologiæ, Pt. III. Qu. 27 (De sanctificatione B. Virg.),
   Art. 1-5; in Libr. I. Sentent. Dist. 44, Qu. 1, Art. 3. Nevertheless,
   Perrone (pp. 231 sqq.) thinks that St. Bernard and St. Thomas are not
   in the way of a definition of the new dogma, 'because they wrote at a
   time when this view was not yet made quite clear, and because they
   lacked the principal support, which subsequently came to its aid; hence
   they must in this case be regarded as private teachers, propounding
   their own particular opinions, but not as witnesses of the traditional
   meaning of the Church.' He then goes on to charge these doctors with
   comparative ignorance of previous Church history. This may be true, but
   does not help the matter; since the fuller knowledge of the Fathers in
   modern times reveals a still wider dissent from the dogma of the
   Immaculate Conception.

   [233] The other Popes, who taught that Mary was conceived in sin, are
   Gelasius I., Innocent V., John XXII., and Clement VI. (d. 1352). The
   proof is furnished by the Jansenist Launoy, Proescriptions, Opera I.
   pp. 17 sqq., who also shows that the early Franciscans, and even Loyola
   and the early Jesuits, denied the Immaculate Conception of Mary.
   Perrone calls him an 'irreligious innovator' (p. 34), and an 'impudent
   liar' (p. 161), but does not refute his arguments, and evades the force
   of his quotations from Leo, Gelasius, and Gregory by the futile remark
   that they would prove too much, viz., that Mary was even born in sin,
   and not purified before the Incarnation, which would be impious!

   [234] Duns Scotus, Opera, Lugd. 1639, Tom. VII. Pt. I. pp. 91-100. One
   of his arguments of probability is that, as God blots out original sin
   by baptism every day, he can as well do it in the moment of conception.
   Compare Perrone, pp. 18 sqq.

   [235] Related by Wadding, in his Annal. Minorum, Lugd. 1635, Tom. III.
   p. 37, but rejected by Natalis Alexander, in his Church History, as a
   fiction, and doubted even by Perrone (p. 163), who says, however, that
   Duns Scotus refuted all the arguments of his opponents 'in a truly
   astounding manner.'

   [236] Sessio V.: 'Declarat S. Synodus, non esse suæ intentionis,
   comprehendere in hoc decreto, ubi de peccato originali agitur, beatam
   et immaculatam Virginem Mariam, Dei genitricem; sed observandas esse
   constitutiones felicis recordationis Sixti Papæ IV. sub poenis in eis
   constitutionibus contentis, quas innovat.'

   [237] 'Ejus (sc. Mariæ),' says Alexander VII., in the bull Sollicitudo
   Omnium Ecclesiarum (Bullar. Rom. ed. Coquelines, Tom. VI. p. 182),
   'animam in primo instanti creationis atque infusionis in corpus fuisse
   speciali Dei gratia et privilegio, intuitu meritorum Christi, ejus
   Filii, humani generis Redemptoris, a macula peccati originalis
   præservatam immunem.' Compare the decree of Pius IX. p. 110, which
   substitutes suæ conceptionis for creationis atque infusionis (animæ) in
   corpus, and ab omni originalis culpæ labe for a macula peccati
   originalis.

   [238] L.c. p. 33.

   [239] Perrone, ch. xiv. pp. 102 sqq.

   [240] As to the time of the creation and infusion of the soul, whether
   it took place simultaneously with the generation of the body, or on the
   fortieth day (as was formerly supposed), there is no fixed opinion
   among Roman divines.

   [241] So the matter is explained by Perrone at the beginning of his
   Treatise, pp. 1-4; and this accords with the bull of Alexander VII. (in
   primo instanti creationis atque infusionis in corpus, etc.), see p.
   125.

   [242] The profounder schoolmen, however, represented by St. Thomas, had
   a deeper view of original sin, nearer to that of Augustine and the
   Reformers. The same is true of Möhler, who speaks of a 'deep
   vulneration of the soul in all its powers,' and a 'perverse tendency of
   the will,' as a necessary consequence of the Fall.

   [243] . . . 'intuitu meritorum Christi Jesu, Salvatoris humani
   generis.'

   [244] . . . 'doctrinam . . . esse a Deo revelatam,' etc.

   the Vatican Decrees; see below, § 31.

   On the 8th of December, 1864, just ten years after the proclamation of
   the sinlessness of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius IX. issued an encyclical
   letter 'Quanta cura,' denouncing certain dangerous heresies and errors
   of the age, which threatened to undermine the foundations of the
   Catholic religion and of civil society, and exhorting the Bishops to
   counteract these errors, and to teach that 'kingdoms rest on the
   foundation of the Catholic faith;' that it is the chief duty of civil
   government 'to protect the Church;' that 'nothing is more advantageous
   and glorious for rulers of States than to give free scope to the
   Catholic Church, and not to allow any encroachment upon her liberty.'
   [245] In the same letter the Pope offers to all the faithful a complete
   indulgence for one month during the year 1865, [246] and expresses, in
   conclusion, his unbounded confidence in the intercession of the
   immaculate and most holy Mother of God, who has destroyed all the
   heresies in the whole world, and who, being seated as queen at the
   right hand of her only begotten Son, can secure any thing she asks from
   him. [247]

   To this characteristic Encyclical is added the so-called Syllabus,
   i.e., a catalogue of eighty errors of the age, which had been
   previously pointed out by Pius IX. in Consistorial Allocutions,
   Encyclical and other Apostolic Letters, but are here conveniently
   brought together, and were transmitted by Cardinal Antonelli to all the
   Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church.

   This extraordinary document presents a strange mixture of truth and
   error. It is a protest against atheism, materialism, and other forms of
   infidelity which every Christian must abhor; but it is also a
   declaration of war against modern civilization and the course of
   history for the last three hundred years. Like the papal bulls against
   the Jansenists, it is purely negative, but it implies the assertion of
   doctrines the very opposite to those which are rejected as errors.
   [248] It expressly condemns religious and civil liberty, the separation
   of Church and State; and indirectly it asserts the Infallibility of the
   Pope, the exclusive right of Romanism to recognition by the State, the
   unlawfulness of all non-Catholic religions, the complete independence
   of the Roman hierarchy from the civil government (yet without allowing,
   a separation), the power of the Church to coerce and enforce, and its
   supreme control over public education, science, and literature.

   The number of errors was no doubt suggested by the example of
   Epiphanius, the venerable father of heresy-hunters (d. 403), who, in
   his Panarion, or Medicine-Chest, furnishes antidotes for the poison of
   no less than eighty heresies (including twenty before Christ), probably
   with a mystic reference to the octoginta concubinæ in the Song of
   Solomon (vi. 8).

   The Pope divides the eighty errors of the nineteenth century into ten
   sections, as follows:

   I. Pantheism, Naturalism, and Absolute Rationalism, No. 1-7.

   Under this head are condemned the following errors:

   (1.) The denial of the existence of God.

   (2.) The denial of his revelation.

   (3 and 4.) The sufficiency of human reason to enlighten and to guide
   men.

   (5.) Divine revelation is imperfect, and subject to indefinite
   progress.

   (6.) The Christian faith contradicts human reason, and is an obstacle
   to progress.

   (7.) The prophecies and miracles of the Bible are poetic fictions, and
   Jesus himself is a myth. [249]

   II. Moderate Rationalism, No. 8-14.

   Among these errors are:

   (12.) The decrees of the Roman See hinder the progress of science.

   (13.) The scholastic method of theology is unsuited to our age. [250]

   (14.) Philosophy must be treated without regard to revelation.

   III. Indifferentism, Latitudinarianism, No. 15-18.

   (15.) Every man may embrace and profess that religion which commends
   itself to his reason. [251]

   (16.) Men may be saved under any religion. [252]

   (17.) We may at least be hopeful concerning the eternal salvation of
   all non-Catholics. [253]

   (18.) Protestantism is only a different form of the same Christian
   religion, in which we may please God as well as in the Catholic Church.
   [254]

   IV. Socialism, Communism, Secret Societies, Bible Societies,
   Clerico-Liberal Societies.

   Under this head there are no specifications, but the reader is referred
   to previous Encyclicals of 1848, 1849, 1854, 1863, in which 'ejusmodi
   pestes sæpe gravissimisque verborum formulis reprobantur.' The Bible
   Societies, therefore, are put on a par with socialism and communism, as
   pestilential errors worthy of the severest reprobation!

   V. Errors respecting the Church and her Rights.

   Twenty errors (19-38), such as these: the Church is subject to the
   State; the Church has no right to exercise her authority without the
   leave and assent of the State; the Church has not the power to define
   dogmatically that the religion of the Catholic Church is the only true
   religion; Roman Pontiffs and oecumenical Councils have exceeded the
   limits of their power, usurped the rights of princes, and have erred
   even in matters of faith and morals; [255] the Church has no power to
   avail herself of force, or any temporal power, direct or indirect;
   [256] besides the inherent power of the Episcopate, there is another
   temporal power conceded expressly or tacitly by the civil government,
   which may be revoked by the same at its pleasure; it does not
   exclusively belong to the jurisdiction of the Church to direct the
   teaching of theology; nothing forbids a general council, or the will of
   the people, to transfer the supreme Pontiff from Rome to some other
   city; national Churches, independent of the authority of the Roman
   Pontiff, may be established; [257] the Roman Pontiffs have contributed
   to the Greek schism. [258]

   VI. Errors concerning Civil Society, considered as well in itself as in
   its relations to the Church. Seventeen errors (39-55).

   (44.) 'Civil authority may meddle in things pertaining to religion,
   morals, and the spiritual government.'

   (45.) 'The whole government of public schools, in which the youth of a
   Christian commonwealth is trained, with the exception of some Episcopal
   seminaries, can and must be assigned to the civil authority.' [259]

   (46.) 'The method of study even in the seminaries of the clergy is
   subject to the civil authority.'

   (52.) 'The lay government has the right to depose Bishops from the
   exercise of pastoral functions, and is not bound to obey the Roman
   Pontiff in those things which pertain to the institution of bishoprics
   and bishops.'

   (55.) 'The Church is to be separated from the State, and the State from
   the Church.' [260]

   VII. Errors in Natural and Christian Ethics, No. 56-64. Here among
   other things are condemned the principle of non-intervention, and
   rebellion against legitimate princes.

   VIII. Errors on Christian Matrimony, No. 65-74.

   Here the Pope condemns not only loose views on marriage and divorce,
   but also civil marriage, and any theory which does not admit it to be a
   sacrament. [261]

   IX. Errors regarding the Civil Principality of the Roman Pontiff, No.
   75, 76.

   (75.) Concerning the compatibility of the temporal reign with the
   spiritual, there is a difference of opinion among the sons of the
   Christian and Catholic Church.

   (76.) The abrogation of the civil government of the Apostolic See would
   be conducive to the liberty and welfare of the Church.

   X. Errors referring to Modern Liberalism, No. 77-80.

   Under this head are condemned the principles of religious liberty as
   they have come to prevail in the most enlightened States of
   Christendom. The Pope still holds that it is right to forbid and
   exclude all religions but his own, where he has the power to do so (as
   he had and exercised in Rome before 1870); and he refuses to make any
   terms with modern civilization. [262]

   The Syllabus, though resting solely on the authority of the Pope, must
   be regarded as an integral portion of the Roman Creed; the Pope having
   since been declared infallible in his official utterances. The most
   objectionable as well as the least objectionable parts of it have been
   formally sanctioned by the Vatican Council. The rest may be similarly
   sanctioned hereafter. The Syllabus expresses the genuine spirit of
   Popery, to which may be applied the dictum of the General of the
   Jesuits: 'Aut sit ut est, aut non sit.' It can not change without
   destroying itself.

   In the mean time the politico-ecclesiastical doctrines of the Syllabus,
   together with the Infallibility decree, have provoked a new conflict
   between the Pope and the Emperor. Pius IX. looks upon the State with
   the same proud contempt as Gregory VII. 'Persecution of the Church,' he
   said after the recent expulsion of the Jesuits (1872), 'is folly: a
   little stone [Dan. ii. 45] will break the colossus [of the new German
   empire] to pieces.' But Bismarck, who is made of sterner stuff than
   Henry IV., protests: 'We shall not go to Canossa.'

   American Protestants and European Free Churchmen reject all
   interference of the civil government with the liberty and internal
   affairs of the Church as much as the Pope, but they do this on the
   basis of a peaceful separation of Church and State, and an equality of
   all forms of Christianity before the law; while the Syllabus claims
   absolute freedom and independence exclusively for the Roman hierarchy,
   and claims this even in those countries where the State supports the
   Church, and has therefore a right to a share in its government.

   [The Syllabus of Pius IX. was substantially confirmed by Leo XIII.,
   Nov. 1, 1885, June 1, 1889, and Feb. 1, 1890, and Pius XI. in pascendi
   gregis, 1907. It is pronounced infallible by Lehmkuhl, Theol. Mor.,
   II., 780, Straub, de eccles., II., 398-402, and Leitner, Hdbuch. des
   kath. Kirchenrechts, 2nd ed., p. 15. Other documents pronounced by
   Lehmkuhl, II., 726-88, infallible, are Leo X.'s bull against Luther,
   1520, Innocent X.'s against Jansen, Innocent XI.'s against the Laxists,
   etc.--Ed.]

   The above are only the most important works of the large and increasing
   literature, historical, apologetic, and polemic, on the Vatican
   Council. A. Erlecke, in a pamphlet, Die Literatur des röm. Concils,
   gives a list of over 200 books and pamphlets which appeared in Germany
   alone before 1871. Friedberg notices 1041 writings on the subject till
   June 1872. Since then the Gladstone Expostulation on the political
   aspects of the Vatican Decrees, Lond. 1874, and his Vaticanism, 1875,
   have called forth a newspaper and pamphlet war, and put Dr. J. H.
   Newman and Archbishop Manning on the defensive.]

   More than three hundred years after the close of the Council of Trent,
   Pope Pius IX., who had proclaimed the new dogma of the Immaculate
   Conception, who in the presence of five hundred Bishops had celebrated
   the eighteenth centennial of the martyrdom of the Apostles Peter and
   Paul, and who was permitted to survive not only the golden wedding of
   his priesthood, but even--alone among his more than two hundred and
   fifty predecessors--the silver wedding of his popedom (thus falsifying
   the tradition 'non videbit annos Petri'), resolved to convoke a new
   oecumenical Council, which was to proclaim his own infallibility in all
   matters of faith and discipline, and thus to put the top-stone to the
   pyramid of the Roman hierarchy.

   He first intimated his intention, June 26, 1867, in an Allocution to
   five hundred Bishops who were assembled at the eighteenth centenary of
   the martyrdom of St. Peter in Rome. The Bishops, in a most humble and
   obsequious response, July 1, 1867, approved of his heroic courage, to
   employ, in his old age, an extreme measure for an extreme danger, and
   predicted a new splendor of the Church, and a new triumph of the
   kingdom of God. [263] Whereupon the Pope announced to them that he
   would convene the Council under the special auspices of the immaculate
   Virgin, who had crushed the serpent's head and was mighty to destroy
   alone all the heresies of the world. [264]

   The call was issued by an Encyclical, commencing Æterni Patris
   Unigenitus Filius, in the twenty-third year of his Pontificate, on the
   feast of St. Peter and Paul, June 29, 1868. It created at once a
   universal commotion in the Christian world, and called forth a
   multitude of books and pamphlets even before the Council convened. The
   highest expectations were suspended by the Pope and his sympathizers on
   the coming event. What the Council of Trent had effected against the
   Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, the Council of the
   Vatican was to accomplish against the more radical and dangerous foes
   of modern liberalism and rationalism, which threatened to undermine
   Romanism itself in its own strongholds. It was to crush the power of
   infidelity, and to settle all that belongs to the doctrine, worship,
   and discipline of the Church, and the eternal salvation of souls. [265]
   It was even hoped that the Council might become a general feast of
   reconciliation of divided Christendom; and hence the Greek schismatics,
   and the Protestant heretics and other non-Catholics, were invited by
   two special letters of the Pope (Sept. 8, and Sept. 13, 1868) to return
   on this auspicious occasion to 'the only sheepfold of Christ,' for the
   salvation of their souls. [266]

   But the Eastern Patriarchs spurned the invitation, as an insult to
   their time-honored rights and traditions, from which they could not
   depart. [267] The Protestant communions either ignored or respectfully
   declined it. [268]

   Thus the Vatican Council, like that of Trent, turned out to be simply a
   general Roman Council, and apparently put the prospect of a reunion of
   Christendom farther off than ever before.

   While these sanguine expectations of Pius IX. were doomed to
   disappointment, the chief object of the Council was attained in spite
   of the strong opposition of the minority of liberal Catholics. This
   object, which for reasons of propriety is omitted in the bull of
   convocation and other preliminary acts, but clearly stated by the
   organs of the Ultramontane or Jesuitical party, was nothing less than
   the proclamation of the personal Infallibility of the Pope, as a
   binding article of the Roman Catholic faith for all time to come. [269]
   Herein lies the whole importance of the Council; all the rest dwindles
   into insignificance, and could never have justified its convocation.

   After extensive and careful preparations, the first (and perhaps the
   last) Vatican Council was solemnly opened amid the sound of innumerable
   bells and the cannon of St. Angelo, but under frowning skies and a
   pouring rain, on the festival of the Immaculate Conception of the
   Virgin Mary, Dec. 8, 1869, in the Basilica of the Vatican. [270] It
   reached its height at the fourth public session, July 18, 1870, when
   the decree of Papal Infallibility was proclaimed. After this it dragged
   on a sickly existence till October 20, 1870, when it was adjourned till
   Nov. 11, 1870, but indefinitely postponed on account of the
   extraordinary change in the political situation of Europe. For on the
   second of September the French Empire, which had been the main support
   of the temporal power of the Pope, collapsed with the surrender of
   Napoleon III., at the old Huguenot stronghold of Sedan, to the
   Protestant King William of Prussia, and on the twentieth of September
   the Italian troops, in the name of King Victor Emanuel, took possession
   of Rome, as the future capital of united Italy. Whether the Council
   will ever be convened again to complete its vast labors, like the twice
   interrupted Council of Trent, remains to be seen. But, in proclaiming
   the personal Infallibility of the Pope, it made all future oecumenical
   Councils unnecessary for the definition of dogmas and the regulation of
   discipline, so that hereafter they will be expensive luxuries and empty
   ritualistic shows. The acts of the Vatican Council, as far as they go,
   are irrevocable.

   The attendance was larger than that of any of its eighteen
   predecessors, [271] and presented an imposing array of hierarchical
   dignity and power such as the world never saw before, and as the
   Eternal City itself is not likely ever to see again. What a contrast
   this to the first Council of the apostles, elders, and brethren in an
   upper chamber in Jerusalem! The whole number of prelates of the Roman
   Catholic Church, who are entitled to a seat in an oecumenical Council,
   is one thousand and thirty-seven. [272] Of these there were present at
   the opening of the Council 719, viz., 49 Cardinals, 9 Patriarchs, 4
   Primates, 121 Archbishops, 479 Bishops, 57 Abbots and Generals of
   monastic orders. [273] This number afterwards increased to 764, viz.,
   49 Cardinals, 10 Patriarchs, 4 Primates, 105 diocesan Archbishops, 22
   Archbishops in partibus infidelium, 424 diocesan Bishops, 98 Bishops in
   partibus, and 52 Abbots, and Generals of monastic orders. [274]
   Distributed according to continents, 541 of these belonged to Europe,
   83 to Asia, 14 to Africa, 113 to America, 13 to Oceanica. At the
   proclamation of the decree of Papal Infallibility, July 18, 1870, the
   number was reduced to 535, and afterwards it dwindled down to 200 or
   180.

   Among the many nations represented, [275] the Italians had a vast
   majority of 276, of whom 143 belonged to the former Papal States alone.
   France, with a much larger Catholic population, had only 84, Austria
   and Hungary 48, Spain 41, Great Britain 35, Germany 19, the United
   States 48, Mexico 10, Switzerland 8, Belgium 6, Holland 4, Portugal 2,
   Russia 1. The disproportion between the representatives of the
   different nations and the number of their constituents was
   overwhelmingly in favor of the Papal influence. Nearly one half of the
   Fathers were entertained during the Council at the expense of the Pope.

   The Romans themselves were remarkably indifferent to the Council,
   though keenly alive to the financial gain which the dogma of the
   Infallibility of their sovereign would bring to the Eternal City and
   the impoverished Papal treasury. [276] It is well known, how soon after
   the Council they voted almost in a body against the temporal power of
   the Pope, and for their new master.

   The strictest secresy was enjoined upon the members of the Council.
   [277] The stenographic reports of the proceedings were locked up in the
   archives. The world was only to know the final results as proclaimed in
   the public sessions, until it should please the Roman court to issue an
   official history. But the freedom of the press in the nineteenth
   century, the elements of discord in the Council itself, the enterprise
   or indiscretion of members and friends of both parties, frustrated the
   precautions. The principal facts, documents, speeches, plans, and
   intrigues leaked out in the official schemata, the controversial
   pamphlets of Prelates, and the private reports and letters of outside
   observers who were in intimate and constant intercourse with their
   friends in the Council. [278]

   The subject-matter for deliberation was divided into four parts: on
   Faith, Discipline, Religious Orders, and on Rites, including Missions.
   Each part was assigned to a special Commission (Congregatio or
   Deputatio), consisting of 24 Prelates elected by ballot for the whole
   period of the Council, with a presiding Cardinal appointed by the Pope.
   These Commissions prepared the decrees on the basis of schemata
   previously drawn up by learned divines and canonists, and
   confidentially submitted to the Bishops in print. [279] The decrees
   were then discussed, revised, and adopted in secret sessions by the
   General Congregation (Congregationes generales), including all the
   Fathers, with five presiding Cardinals appointed by the Pope. The
   General Congregation held eighty-nine sessions in all. Finally, the
   decrees thus matured were voted upon by simple yeas or nays (Placet or
   Non Placet), and solemnly promulgated in public sessions in the
   presence and by the authority of the Pope. A conditional assent (Placet
   juxta modum) was allowed in the secret, but not in the public sessions.

   There were only four such public sessions held during the ten months of
   the Council, viz., the opening session (lasting nearly seven hours),
   Dec. 8, 1869, which was a mere formality, but of a ritualistic splendor
   and magnificence such as can be gotten up nowhere on earth but in St.
   Peter's Cathedral in Rome; the second session, Jan. 6, 1870, when the
   Fathers simply professed each one before the Pope the Nicene Creed and
   the Profession of the Tridentine Faith; the third session, April 24,
   1870, when the dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith was
   unanimously adopted; and the fourth session, July 18, 1870, when the
   first dogmatic constitution on the Church of Christ and the
   Infallibility of the Pope was adopted with two dissenting votes.

   The management of the Council was entirely in the hands of the Pope and
   his dependent Cardinals and Jesuitical advisers. He originated the
   topics which were to be acted on; he selected the preparatory
   committees of theologians (mostly of the Ultramontane school) who,
   during the winter of 1868-69, drew up the schemata; he appointed the
   presiding officers of the four Deputations, and of the General
   Congregation; and he proclaimed the decrees in his own name, 'with the
   approval of the Council.' [280] He provided, by the bull 'Cum, Romanis
   Pontificibus,' of Dec. 4, 1869, for the immediate suspension and
   adjournment of the Council in case of his death. He even personally
   interfered during the proceedings in favor of his new dogma by praising
   Infallibilists, and by ignoring or rebuking anti-Infallibilists. [281]
   The discussion could be virtually arrested by the presiding Cardinals
   at the request of only ten members; we say virtually, for although it
   required a vote of the Council, a majority was always sure. The revised
   order of business, issued Feb. 22, 1870, departed even from the old
   rule requiring absolute or at least moral unanimity in definitions of
   faith (according to the celebrated canon quod semper, quod ubique, quod
   ab omnibus creditum est), and substituted for it a mere numerical
   majority, in order to secure the triumph of the Infallibility decree in
   spite of a powerful minority. Nothing could be printed in Rome against
   Infallibility, while the organs of Infallibility had full freedom to
   print and publish what they pleased. [282] Such prominence of the Pope
   is characteristic of a Council convoked for the very purpose of
   proclaiming his personal infallibility, but is without precedent in
   history (except in some mediæval Councils); even the Council of Trent
   maintained its own dignity and comparative independence by declaring
   its decrees in its own name. [283]

   This want of freedom of the Council--not to speak of the strict police
   surveillance over the members--was severely censured by liberal
   Catholics. More than one hundred Prelates of all nations signed a
   strong protest (dated Rome, March 1, 1870) against the order of
   business, especially against the mere majority vote, and expressed the
   fear that in the end the authority of this Council might be impaired as
   wanting in truth and liberty--a calamity so direful in these uneasy
   times, that a greater could not be imagined. But this protest, like all
   the acts of the minority, was ignored.

   The proceedings were, of course, in the official language of the Roman
   Church, which all Prelates could understand and speak, but very few
   with sufficient ease to do justice to themselves and their subjects.
   The acoustic defects of the Council-hall and the difference of
   pronunciation proved a great inconvenience, and the Continentals
   complained [284] that they could not understand the English Latin. The
   Council had a full share of ignorance and superstition, [285] and was
   disgraced by intrigues and occasional outbursts of intolerance and
   passion such as are, alas! not unusual in deliberative assemblies even
   of the Christian Church. [286] But it embraced also much learning and
   eloquence, especially on the part of the French and German Episcopate.
   Upon the whole, it compares favorably, as to intellectual ability,
   moral character, and far-reaching effect, with preceding Roman
   Councils, and must be regarded as the greatest event in the history of
   the Papacy since the Council of Trent.

   The chief importance of the Council of the Vatican lies in its decree
   on Papal supremacy and Infallibility. It settled the internal
   dissensions between Ultramontanism and Gallicanism, which struck at the
   root of the fundamental principle of authority; it destroyed the
   independence of the Episcopate, and made it a tool of the Primacy; it
   crushed liberal Catholicism; it completed the system of Papal
   absolutism; it raised the hitherto disputed opinion of Papal
   Infallibility to the dignity of a binding article of faith, which no
   Catholic can deny without loss of salvation. The Pope may now say not
   only, 'I am the tradition' (La tradizione son' io), but also, 'I am the
   Church' (L'église c'est moi)!

   But this very triumph of absolutism marks also a new departure. It gave
   rise to a secession headed by the ablest divines of the Roman Church.
   It put the Papacy into direct antagonism to the liberal tendencies of
   the age. It excited the hostility of civil government in all those
   countries where Church and State are united on the basis of a concordat
   with the Roman See. No State with any degree of self-respect can treat
   with a sovereign who claims infallibility, and therefore unconditional
   submission in matters of moral duty as well as of faith. In reaching
   the summit of its power, the Papacy has hastened its downfall.

   For Protestants and Greeks the Vatican Council is no more oecumenical
   than that of Trent, and has only intensified the antagonism. Its
   oecumenicity is also denied by the Old Catholic scholars--Döllinger,
   von Schulte, and Reinkens --because it lacked the two fundamental
   conditions of liberty of discussion, and moral unanimity of suffrage.
   [287] But the subsequent submission of all the Bishops who had voted
   against Papal Infallibility, supplies the defect as far as the Roman
   Church is concerned. There was nothing left to them but either to
   submit or to be expelled. They chose the former, and thus destroyed the
   legal and moral force of their protest, although not the power of truth
   and the nature of the facts on which it was based. Henceforward
   Romanism must stand or fall with the Vatican Council. But (as we have
   before intimated) Romanism is not to be confounded with Catholicism any
   more than the Jewish hierarchy which crucified our Saviour, is
   identical with the people of Israel, from which sprang the Apostles and
   early converts of Christianity. The destruction of the infallible and
   irreformable Papacy may be the emancipation of Catholicism, and lead it
   from its prison-house to the light of a new Reformation.

   [263] 'Summo igitur gauaio,' said the five hundred Bishops, 'repletus
   est animus noster, dum sacrato ore Tuo intelleximus, tot inter
   præsentis temporis discrimina eo Te esse consilio, ut "maximum," prout
   aiebat inclitus Tuus prædecessor Paulus III., "in maximis rei
   Christianæ periculis remedium," Concilium oecumenicum convoces. Annuat
   Deus huic Tuo proposito, cuius ipse Tibi mentem inspiravit; habeantque
   tandem oevi nostri homines, qui infirmi in fide, semper discentes et
   nunquam ad veritatis agnitionem pervenientes omni vento doctrinæ
   circumferuntur, in sacrosancta hac Synodo novam, præsentissimamque
   occasionem accedendi ad sanctam Ecclesiam columnam ac firmamentum
   veritatis, cognoscendi salutiferam fidem, perniciosos reiiciendi
   errores; ac fiat, Deo propitio, et conciliatrice Deipara Immaculata,
   hæc Synodus grande opus unitatis, sanctificationis et pacis, unde novus
   in Ecclesiam splendor redundet, novus regni Dei triumphus consequatur.
   Et hoc ipso Tuæ providentiæ opere denuo exibeatur mundo immensa

   cunctis, Ecclesiam eo quod super solidissima Petra fundetur, tantum

   auctoritatis et debitæ eidem obedientiæ manifestissimo specimine, in
   divina Pontificatus institutione dato, ea omnia stabilita et sacrata
   sint, quæ societatum fundamenta ac diuturnitatem solident.'

   [264] 'Quod sane votum apertius etiam se prodit in eo communi Concilii
   oecumenici desiderio, quod omnes non modo perutile, sed et necessarium
   arbitramini. Superbia enim humana, veterem ansum instauratura, jamdiu
   per commenticium progressum civitatem et turrem extruere nititur, cujus
   culmen pertingat ad coelum, unde demum Deus ipse detrahi possit. At is
   descendisse videtur inspecturus opus, et ædificantium linguas ita
   confusurus, ut non audiat unusquisque vocem proximi sui: id enim animo
   objiciunt Ecclesiæ vexationes, miseranda civilis consortii conditio,
   perturbatio rerum omnium, in qua versamur. Cui sane gravissimæ
   calamitati sola certe objici potest divina Ecclesiæ virtus, quæ tunc
   maxime se prodit, cum Episcopi a Summo Pontifice convocati, eo præside,
   conveniunt in nomine Domini de Ecclesiæ rebus acturi. Et gaudemus
   omnino, proevertisse vos hac in re propositum jamdiu a nobis conceptum,
   commendandi sacrum hunc coetum ejus patrocinio, cujus pedi a rerum
   exordio serpentis caput subjectum fuit, quoeque deinde universas
   hæreses sola interemit. Satisfacturi propterea communi desiderio jam
   nunc nunciamus, futurum quandocunque Concilium sub auspiciis Deiparæ
   Virginis ab omni labe immunis esse constituendum, et eo aperiendum die,
   quo insignis hujus privilegii ipsi collati memoria recolitur. Faxit
   Deus, faxit Immaculata Virgo, ut amplissimos e saluberrimo isto
   Concilio fructus percipere valeamus.' While the Pope complains of the
   pride of the age in attempting to build another tower of Babel, it did
   not occur to him that the assumption of infallibility, i.e., a
   predicate of the Almighty by a mortal man, is the consummation of
   spiritual pride.

   [265] After describing, in the stereotyped phrases of the Roman Court,
   the great solicitude of the successors of Peter for pure doctrine and
   good government, and the terrible tempests and calamities by which the
   Catholic Church and the very foundations of society are shaken in the
   present age, the Pope's Encyclical comprehensively but vaguely, and
   with a prudent reserve concerning the desired dogma of Infallibility,
   defines the objects of the Council in these words: 'In oecumenico hoc
   Concilio ea omnia accuratissime examine sunt perpendenda ac statuenda,
   quæ hisce præsertim asperrimis temporibus majorem Dei gloriam, et fidei
   integritatem, divinique cultus decorem, sempiternamque hominum salutem,
   et utriusque Cleri disciplinam ejusque salutarem solidamque culturam,
   atque ecclesiasticarum legum observantiam, morumque emendationem, et
   christianam juventutis institutionem, et communem omnium pacem et
   concordiam in primis respiciunt. Atque etiam intentissimo studio
   curandum est, ut, Deo bene juvante, omnia ab Ecclesia et civili
   societate amoveantur mala, ut miseri errantes ad rectum veritatis,
   justitiæ salutisque tramitem reducantur, ut vitiis erroribusque
   eliminatis, augusta nostra religio ejusque salutifera doctrina ubique
   terrarum reviviscat, et quotidie magis propagetur et dominetur, atque
   ita pietas, honestas, probitas, justitia, caritas omnesque Christianæ
   virtutes cum maxima humanæ societatis utilitate vigeant et
   efflorescant.'

   [266] 'Omnes Christianos etiam atque etiam hortamur et obsecramus, ut
   ad unicum Christi ovile redire festinent.' And at the end again, 'unum
   ovile et unus pastor;' according to the false and mischievous
   translation of John x. 16 in the Vulgate (followed by the authorized
   English Version), instead of 'one flock' (mia poimne, not aule). There
   may be many folds, and yet one flock under one Shepherd, as there are
   'many mansions' in heaven (John xiv. 2).

   [267] The Patriarch of Constantinople declined even to receive the
   Papal letter from the Papal messenger, for the reasons that it had
   already been published in the Giornale di Roma; that it contained
   principles contrary to the spirit of the Gospel, the doctrines of the
   oecumenical Councils, and the holy Fathers; that there was no supreme
   Bishop in the Church except Christ; and that the Bishop of Old Rome had
   no right to convoke an oecumenical Council without first consulting the
   Eastern Patriarchs. The other Oriental Bishops either declined or
   returned the Papal letter of invitation. See the documents in
   Friedberg, l.c. pp. 233-253; in Officielle Actenstücke, etc., pp.
   127-135; and in the Chronique concernant le Prochain Concile, Vol. I.
   pp. 3 sqq., 103 sqq.

   [268] The Evangelical Oberkirchenrath of Berlin, the Kirchentag of
   Stuttgart, 1869, the Paris Branch of the Evangelical Alliance, 'The
   Venerable Company of Pastors of Geneva,' the Professors of the
   University of Groningen, the Hungarian Lutherans assembled at Pesth,
   and the Presbyterians of the United States, took notice of the Papal
   invitation, all declining it, and reaffirming the principles of the
   Protestant Reformation. The Presbyterian Dr. Cumming, of London, seemed
   willing to accept the invitation if the Pope would allow a discussion
   of the reasons of the separation from Rome, but was informed by the
   Pope, through Archbishop Manning, in two letters (Sept. 4, and Oct. 30,
   1869), that such discussion of questions long settled would be entirely
   inconsistent with the infallibility of the Church and the supremacy of
   the Holy See. See the documents in Friedberg, pp. 235-257; comp. pp.
   16, 17, and Offic. Actenstücke, pp. 158-176. The Chronique concernant
   le Prochain Concile, p. 169, criticises at length the American
   Presbyterian letter signed by Jacobus and Fowler (Moderators of the
   General Assembly), and sees in its reasons for declining a proof of
   'heretical obstinacy and ignorance.'

   [269] So the Civiltà cattolica (a monthly Review established 1850, at
   Rome, the principal organ of the Jesuits, and the Moniteur of the Papal
   Court) defined the programme, Feb. 6, 1869; adding to it also the
   adoption of the Syllabus of 1864, and, perhaps, the proclamation of the
   assumption of the Virgin Mary to heaven. The last is reserved for the
   future. The Archbishop of Westminster (Manning) and the Archbishop of
   Mechlin (Dechamps) predicted, in pastoral letters of 1867 and 1869, the
   proclamation of the Papal Infallibility as a certain event. To avert
   this danger, the Bishop of Orleans (Dupanloup), Père Gratry of the
   Oratory, Père Hyacinthe, Bishop Maret (Dean of the Theological Faculty
   of Paris), Montalembert, John Henry Newman, the German Catholic laity
   (in the Coblenz Address), in part the German Bishops assembled at
   Fulda, and especially the learned authors of the Janus, lifted their
   voice, though in vain. See the literature on the subject in Friedberg,
   pp. 17-21.

   [270] Hence the name. The right cross-nave of St. Peter's Church, which
   itself is a large church, was separated by a painted board wall, and
   fitted up as the council-hall. See a draught of it in Friedberg, p. 98.
   The hall was very unsuitable for hearing, and had to be repeatedly
   altered. The Pope, it is said (Hase, l.c. p. 26), did not care that all
   the orators should be understood. The Vatican Palace, where the Pope
   now resides, adjoins the Church of St. Peter. Councils were held there
   before, but only of a local character. Formerly the Roman oecumenical
   Councils were held in the Lateran Palace, the ancient residence of the
   Popes, which is connected with the Church of St. John in the Lateran or
   Church of the Saviour ('omnium urbis et orbis ecclesiarum mater et
   caput'). There are five Lateran Councils: the first was held, 1123,
   under Calixtus II.; the second, 1139, under Innocent II.; the third,
   1179, under Alexander III.; the fourth and largest, 1215, under
   Innocent III.; the fifth, 1512-1517, under Leo X., on the eve of the
   Reformation. The basilica of the Lateran contains the head, the
   basilica of St. Peter the body, of St. Peter. The Pope expressed the
   hope that a special inspiration would proceed from the near grave of
   the prince of the Apostles upon the Fathers of the Council.

   [271] As the oecumenical character of two or three Councils is
   disputed, the Vatican Council is variously reckoned as the 19th or 20th
   or 21st oecumenical Council; by strict Romanists (as Manning) as the
   19th. Compare note on p. 91.

   [272] See a full list, with all the titles, in the Lexicon geographicum
   added to the second part of the Acta et Decreta sacrosancti et oecum.
   Conc. Vaticani, Friburgi, 1871. The Prelates 'quibus aut jus aut
   privilegium fuit sedendi in oecumenica synodo Vaticana,' are arranged
   as follows:

   (1.) Eminentissimi et reverendissimi Domini S.E. Rom. Cardinales: (a)
   ordinis Episcoporum, (b) ordinis Presbyterorum. (c) ordinis
   diaconorum--51.

   (2.) Reverendissimi Domini Patriarchæ--11.

   (3.) Reverendissimi DD. Primates--10.

   (4.) Reverendissimi DD. Archiepiscopi--166.

   (5.) Reverendissimi DD. Episcopi--740.

   (6.) Abbates nullius dioceseos--6.

   (7.) Abbates Generales ordinum monasticorum--23.

   (8.) Generales et Vicarii Generales congregationum clericorum
   regularium, ordinum monasticorum, ordinum mendicantium--29. In all,
   1037.

   [273] See the list of names in Friedberg, pp. 376-394.

   [274] See the official Catalogo alfabetico dei Padri presenti al
   Concilio ecumenico Vaticano, Roma, 1870.

   [275] Manning says, 'some thirty nations'--probably an exaggeration.

   [276] Quirinus, pp. 480, 481 (English translation).

   [277] They had to promise and swear to observe ' inviolabilem secreti
   fidem' with regard to the discussions, the opinions, and all matters
   pertaining to the Council. See the form of the oath in Friedberg, p.
   96. In ancient Councils the people are often mentioned as being present
   during the deliberations, and manifesting their feelings of approval
   and disapproval.

   [278] Among the irresponsible but well-informed reporters and
   correspondents must be mentioned especially the writers in the Civiltà
   cattolica, and the Paris Univers, on the part of the Infallibilists;
   and the pseudonymous Quirinus, Prof. Friedrich, and the anonymous
   French authors of Ce qui se passe au Concile, and of La dernière heure
   du Concile, on the part of the anti-Infallibilists.

   [279] There were in all forty-five schemata, divided into four classes:
   (1) circa fidem, (2) circa disciplinam ecclesiæ, (3) circa ordines
   regulares, (4) circa res ritus orientalis et apostolicas missiones. See
   a list in Friedberg, pp. 432-434. Only a part of the schemata were
   submitted, and only the first two schemata de fide were acted upon.
   Friedrich, in the Second Part of his Documenta, gives the schemata, as
   far as they were distributed among the Bishops, together with the
   revisions and criticisms of the Bishops.

   [280] Under the title: Pius episcopus, servus servorum Dei, sacro
   approbante Concilio, ad perpetuam rei memoriam. The order prescribed
   for voting was this: The Pope, through the Secretary, asked the members
   of the Council first in general: Reverendissimi Patres, placentne vobis
   Decreta et Canones qui in hac Constitutione continentur? Then each one
   was called by name, and must vote either placet or non placet. When the
   votes were collected and brought to the Pope, he announced the result
   by this formula: Decreta et Canones qui in Constitutione modo lecta
   continentur, placuerunt omnibus Patribus, nemine dissentiente [if there
   were dissenting votes the Pope stated their number]; Nosque, sacro
   approbante Concilio, illa [sc. decreta] et illos [canones], ita ut
   lecta sunt, definimus, et Apostolica Auctoritate confirmamus. See the
   Monitum in the Giornale di Roma, April 18, 1870; Friedberg, pp.
   462-464.

   [281] See the laudatory letters of Pius to several advocates of
   Infallibility, in Friedberg, pp. 487-495; comp. pp. 108-111. To
   Archbishop Dechamps, of Mechlin, he wrote that, in his tract on Papal
   Infallibility, he had proved the harmony of the Catholic faith with
   human reason so convincingly as to force even the Rationalists to see
   the absurdity of the opposite views. He applauded the indefatigable and
   abusive editor of the Paris Univers, Veuillot, who had collected
   100,000 francs for the Vicar of Christ (May 30, 1870). On the other
   hand, he is reported to have rebuked in conversation Cardinal
   Schwarzenberg by the remark: 'I, John Maria Mastai, believe in the
   infallibility of the Pope. As Pope I have nothing to ask from the
   Council. The Holy Ghost will enlighten it.' He even attacked the memory
   of the eloquent French champion of Catholic interests, the Count
   Montalembert, who died during the Council (March 13, 1870), by saying,
   in the presence of three hundred persons: 'He had a great enemy, pride.
   He was a liberal Catholic, i.e., a half Catholic.' Ce qui se passe au
   Concile, 154 sqq.

   [282] Several minority documents, as Kenrick's speech against
   Infallibility, and the Latin edition of Hefele's tract on Honorius,
   were printed in Naples; the German in Tübingen. But the Civiltà
   cattolica, the irresponsible organ of the Jesuits and the Pope, was
   provided with a special building and income, and every facility for
   obtaining information. See Acton, Quirinus, and Frommann (1.c. p. 13).

   [283] ' Sacrosancta Tridentina Synodas, in Spiritu Sancto legitime
   congregata . . . declarat.' See the order of the Council of Trent as
   republished in Friedrich's Documenta, I. pp. 265 sqq.

   [284] 'Id autem, quod spectat ad numerum suffragiorum requisitum, ut
   quæstiones dogmaticæ solvantur, in quo quidem rei summa est totiusque
   Concilii cardo vertitur, ita grave est, ut nisi admitteretur, quod
   reverenter et enixe postulamus, conscientia nostra intolerabili pondere
   premeretur: timeremus, ne Concilii oecumenici character in dubium
   vocari posset; ne ansa hostibus proeberetur Sanctam Sedem et Concilium
   impetendi, sicque demum apud populum Christianum hujus Concilii
   auctoritas labefactaretur, quasi veritate et libertate caruerit: quod
   his turbatissimis temporibus tanta esset calamitas, ut pejor excogitari
   nulla possit.' See the remarkable protest in Friedberg, pp. 417-422.
   Also Dollinger's critique of the order of business, ib. 422-432;
   Archbishop Kenrick's famous concio habenda at non habita, published in
   Naples, 1870 (and republished in Friedrich's Docum.); the work La
   libertè du Concile et l'infaillibilité, which was either written or
   inspired by Archbishop Darboy, of Paris (in Friedrich's Docum. I. pp.
   129 sqq.), and the same Prelate's speech in the General Congregation,
   May 20, 1870 (ibidem. II. pp. 415 sqq.). Archbishop Manning, sublimely
   ignoring all these facts and documents, and referring us to the
   inaccessible Archives of the Vatican, assures us (Petri Privil. III.
   32) that the Council was as free as the Congress of the United States,
   and that the wonder is, not that the opposition failed of its object,
   but that the Council so long held its peace.

   [285] Some amusing examples are reported by the well-informed Quirinus.
   Bishop Pie, of Poitiers, supported the Papal Infallibility in a session
   of the General Congregation (May 13) by an entirely original argument
   derived from the legend that Peter was crucified downward; for as his
   head bore the whole weight of the body, so the Pope, as the head, bears
   the whole Church; but he is infallible who bears, not he who is borne!
   The Italians and Spaniards applauded enthusiastically. Unfortunately
   for the argument, the head of Peter did not bear his body, but the
   cross bore both; consequently the cross must be infallible. A Sicilian
   Prelate said the Sicilians first doubted the infallibility of Peter
   when he visited the island, and sent a special deputation of inquiry to
   the Virgin Mary, but were assured by her that she remembered well
   having been present when Christ conferred this prerogative on Peter;
   and this satisfied them completely. Quirinus adds: 'The opposition
   Bishops see a proof of the insolent contempt of the majority in thus
   putting up such men as Pie and this Sicilian to speak against them.'
   Letter XLVI. p. 534.

   [286] The following characteristic episode (ignored, of course, in
   Manning's eulogy) is well authenticated by the concurrent and yet
   independent reports of Lord Acton (N. Brit. Rev.), Quirinus (Letter
   XXXII.), Friedrich (Tagebuch, pp. 271, 272), and the author of Ce qui
   se passe au Concile (p. 69); comp. Friedberg (pp. 104-106). When Bishop
   Strossmayer, the boldest member of the opposition and an eloquent
   Latinist, in a session of the General Congregation (March 22), spoke
   favorably of the great Leibnitz, and paid Protestants the poor
   compliment of honesty (quoting from St. Augustine: 'Errant, sed bona
   fide errant'), he was interrupted by the bell of the President (De
   Angelis) and his rebuke, 'This is no place for praising Protestants'
   ('hicce non est locus laudandi Protestantes')! Very true, for the
   Council-hall was only a hundred paces from the Palace of the
   Inquisition. When, resuming, the speaker ventured to attack the
   principle of deciding questions of faith by mere majorities, he was
   more loudly interrupted from all sides by confused exclamations:
   'Shame! shame! down with the heretic!' ('Descendat ab ambone!
   Descendat! Hæreticus! Hæreticus! Damnamus eum! Damnamus!') 'Several
   Bishops sprang from their seats, rushed to the tribune, and shook their
   fists in the speaker's face' (Quirinus, p. 387). When one Bishop
   (Place, of Marseilles) interposed, 'Ego non damno!' the cry was raised
   with increased fury: 'Omnes, omnes illum damnamus! damnamus!'
   Strossmayer was forced by the uproar and the continued ringing of the
   bell to quit the tribune, but did so with a triple 'Protestor.' The
   noise was so great that it could be heard in the interior of St.
   Peter's. Some thought the Garibaldians had broken in; others that
   Infallibility had been proclaimed, and shouted, according to their
   opposite views, either 'Long live the infallible Pope!' or 'Long live
   the Pope, but not the infallible one' (comp. Quirinus, and Ce qui se
   passe, p. 69). Quirinus says that the scene, 'for dramatic force and
   theological significance, exceeded almost any thing in the past history
   of Councils' (p. 386), and that a Bishop of the United States said
   afterwards, 'not without a sense of patriotic pride, that he knew now
   of one assembly still rougher than the Congress of his own country' (p.
   388). Similar scenes of violence occurred in the oecumenical Councils
   of Ephesus and Chalcedon, but Christian civilization ought to have made
   some progress since the fifth century.

   [287] See the Old Catholic protests of the Professors in Munich and
   Breslau in Friedberg, pp. 152-154, and the literature on the reception
   of the Council, ib. 53-56; also the discussion of Frommann, pp. 325
   sqq. 454 sqq. Döllinger, in his famous censure of the new order of the
   Council, takes the ground that the oecumenicity of a Council depends
   upon an authority outside of itself, viz., the public opinion as
   expressed in the subsequent approval of the whole Church; and Pater
   Hötzl laid down the principle that no Council is oecumenical which is
   not approved and adopted as such by the Church. Admitting this, the
   condition is now fulfilled in the case of the Vatican Council to the
   whole extent of the Roman Episcopate, which constitutes the ecclesia
   docens, the laity having nothing to do but to submit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 32. The Vatican Decrees. The Constitution on the Catholic Faith.

   Three schemes on matters of faith were prepared for the Vatican
   Council--one against Rationalism, one on the Church of Christ, and one
   on Christian Matrimony. The first two were revised and adopted; the
   third was indefinitely postponed. There was also much discussion on the
   preparation of a small popular Catechism adapted to the present
   doctrinal status of the Roman Church, and intended to supersede the
   numerous popular Catechisms now in use; but the draft, which assigned
   the whole teaching power of the Church to the Pope, to the exclusion of
   the Episcopate, encountered such opposition (57 Non Placet, 24
   conditional Placet) in the provisional vote of May 4, that it was laid
   on the table and never called up again. [288]

   I. The Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith (Constitutio
   Dogmatica de Fide Catholica).

   It was unanimously adopted in the third public session, April 24
   (Dominica in albis), 1870.

   The original draft laid before the Council embraced eighteen
   chapters--on Pantheism, Rationalism, Scripture and tradition,
   revelation, faith and reason, the Trinity, the two natures of Christ,
   the primitive state, original sin, the Christian redemption, the
   supernatural order of grace; but was laid aside. [289] Archbishop
   Connolly, of Halifax, recommended that it should be decently buried.
   [290]

   In its present form, the Constitution on the Catholic faith is reduced
   to four chapters, with a proemium and a conclusion. Chap. I. treats of
   God as the Creator; Chap. II. of revelation; Chap. III. of faith; Chap.
   IV. of faith and reason. Then follow 18 canons, in which the errors of
   Pantheism, Naturalism, and Rationalism are condemned in a manner
   substantially the same, though more clearly and fully, than had been
   done in the first two sections of the Syllabus.

   The decree asserts, in the old scholastic terminology, the well-known
   principles of Supernaturalism as held by orthodox Christians in all
   ages, but it completely ignores the freedom and progress of theological
   and philosophical science and learning since the Council of Trent, and
   it forbids (in Chap. II.) all interpretation of the Scriptures which
   does not agree with the Romish traditions, the Latin Vulgate, and the
   fictitious 'unanimous consent of the Fathers.' Hence a liberal member
   of the Council, in the course of discussion, declared the schema de
   fide a work of supererogation. 'What boots it,' he said, 'to condemn
   errors which have been long condemned, and tempt no Catholic? The false
   beliefs of mankind are beyond the reach of your decrees. The best
   defense of Catholicism is religious science. Encourage sound learning,
   and prove by deeds as well as words that it is the mission of the
   Church to promote among the nations liberty, light, and true
   prosperity.' [291] On the other hand, the Univers calls the schema a
   'masterpiece of clearness and force;' the Civiltà cattolica sees in it
   'a reflex of the wisdom of God;' [292] and Archbishop Manning thinks
   that its importance 'can not be overestimated,' that it is 'the
   broadest and boldest affirmation of the supernatural and spiritual
   order ever yet made in the face of the world, which is now more than
   ever sunk in sense and heavy with Materialism.' [293] Whatever be the
   value of the positive principles of the schema, its Popish head and
   tail reduce it to a brutum fulmen outside of the Romish Church, and
   even the most orthodox Protestants must apply to it the warning, Timeo
   Danaos et dona ferentes.

   The preamble, even in its present modified form, derives modern
   Rationalism and infidelity, as a legitimate fruit, from the heresies
   condemned by the Council of Trent--that is, from the Protestant
   Reformation; in the face of the fact, patent to every scholar, that
   Protestant theology has been in the thickest of the fight with
   unbelief, and, notwithstanding all its excesses, has produced a far
   richer exegetical and apologetic literature than Romanism during the
   last three hundred years. [294] The boldest testimony heard in the
   Council was directed against this preamble by Bishop Strossmayer, from
   the Turkish frontier (March 22, 1870). He characterized the charge
   against Protestantism as neither just nor charitable. Protestants, he
   said, abhorred the errors condemned in the schema as much as Catholics.
   The germ of Rationalism existed in the Catholic Church before the
   Reformation, especially in the humanism which was nourished in the very
   sanctuary by the highest dignitaries, [295] and bore its worst fruits
   in the midst of a Catholic nation at the time of Voltaire and the
   Encyclopedists. Catholics had produced no better refutation of the
   errors enumerated in the schema than such men as Leibnitz and Guizot.
   There were multitudes of Protestants in Germany, England, and North
   America who loved our Lord Jesus Christ, and had inherited from the
   shipwreck of faith positive truths and monuments of divine grace. [296]
   Although this speech was greeted with execrations (see page 145), it
   had at least the effect that the objectionable preamble was somewhat
   modified. [297]

   The supplement of the decree binds all Catholics to observe also those
   constitutions and decrees by which such erroneous opinions as are not
   here specifically enumerated have been proscribed and condemned by the
   Holy See. This can be so construed as to include all the eighty errors
   of the Syllabus. The minority who in the General Congregation had voted
   Non Placet or only a conditional Placet, were quieted by the official
   assurance that the addition involved no new dogma, and had a
   disciplinary rather than a didactic character. 'Some gave their votes
   with a heavy heart, conscious of the snare.' Strossmayer stayed away.
   Thus a unanimous vote of 667 or 668 fathers was secured in the public
   session, and the Infallibility decree was virtually anticipated. The
   Pope, after proclaiming the dogma, gave the Bishops his benediction of
   peace, and gently intimated what he next expected from them. [298]

   University of Vienna.

   [294] The objectionable passage, as finally adopted, reads thus: 'No
   one is ignorant that the heresies proscribed by the Fathers of Trent,
   by which the divine magisterium of the Church was rejected, and all
   matters regarding religion were surrendered to the judgment of each
   individual, gradually became dissolved into many sects, which disagreed
   and contended with one another, until at length not a few lost all
   faith in Christ. Even the Holy Scriptures, which had previously been
   declared the sole source and judge of Christian doctrine, began to be
   held no longer as divine, but to be ranked among the fictions of
   mythology. Then there arose, and too widely overspread the world, that
   doctrine of Rationalism which opposes itself in every way to the
   Christian religion as a supernatural institution.' See the different
   revisions of the schema de fide in Friedrich's Monum. Pt. II. pp. 3,

   [297] The words in the first revision (Friedr. Docum. II. p. 65),
   systematum monstra, mythismi, rationalismi, indifferentismi nomine
   designata, etc., together with some other offensive expressions, were
   omitted; but, after all, the substance remained. Lord Acton relates
   that the German Jesuit Kleutgen hastily drew up the more moderate form.
   Comp. Quirinus, Letter XXXIII. p. 394 sq. Political influence was also
   brought to bear indirectly upon the Council, as appeared afterwards
   from Italian papers. Bismarck directed the German Embassador at Rome,
   Count Arnim, to inform Cardinal Antonelli that, unless the charge
   against Protestantism was withdrawn, he would not allow the Prussian
   Bishops on their return to resume their functions in a country whose
   faith they had insulted. Friedrich, Tagebuch, pp. 275, 292; Frommann,
   Geschichte des Vat. Concils, p. 145; Hase, Polem. p. 34. The latter
   overestimates the influence of Prussia on the Papal court when he says:
   'If France complains of the Council, Antonelli makes three bows, and
   all remains as before; but if Prussia comes with her mustache and
   cavalry boots, Rome understands that the word is quickly followed by
   the deed, and wisely yields. Strossmayer and von Arnim were in doubt
   which one of them had been most instrumental in saving the Council from
   an impropriety.'

   [298] 'Videtis,' he said, 'Fratres carissimi, quam bonum sit et
   jucundum ambulare in domo Dei cum consensu, ambulare cum pace. Sic
   ambuletis semper. Et quoniam hac die Dominus Noster Jesus Christus
   dedit pacem Apostolis suis, et ego, Vicarius ejus indignus, nomine suo
   do vobis pacem. Pax ista, prout scitis, expellit timorem. Pax ista,
   prout scitis, claudit aures sermonibus imperitis. Ah! ista pax vos
   comitetur omnibus diebus vitæ vestræ; sit ista pax vis in morte, sit
   ista pax vobis gaudium sempiternum in coelis.'

   § 33. The Vatican Decrees, Continued. The Infallibility Decree.

   II. The First Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ
   (constitutio dogmatica prima de ecclesia Christi).

   It was passed, with two dissenting votes, in the fourth public session,
   July 18, 1870. It treats, in four chapters--(1) on the institution of
   the Apostolic Primacy in the blessed Peter; (2) on the perpetuity of
   St. Peter's Primacy in the Roman Pontiff; (3) on the power and nature
   of the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff; (4) on the Infallibility of the
   Roman Pontiff.

   The new features are contained in the last two chapters, which teach
   Papal Absolutism and Papal Infallibility. The third chapter vindicates
   to the Roman Pontiff a superiority of ordinary episcopal (not simply an
   extraordinary primatial) power over all other Churches, and an
   immediate jurisdiction, to which all Catholics, both pastors and
   people, are bound to submit in matters not only of faith and morals,
   but even of discipline and government. [299] He is, therefore, the
   Bishop of Bishops, over every single Bishop, and over all Bishops put
   together; he is in the fullest sense the Vicar of Christ, and all
   Bishops are simply Vicars of the Pope. The fourth chapter teaches and
   defines, as a divinely revealed dogma, that the Roman Pontiff, when
   speaking from his chair (ex cathedra), i.e., in his official capacity,
   to the Christian world on subjects relating to faith or morals, is
   infallible, and that such definitions are irreformable (i.e., final and
   irreversible) in and of themselves, and not in consequence of the
   consent of the Church. [300]

   To appreciate the value and bearing of this decree, we must give a
   brief history of it.

   The Infallibility question was suspended over the Council from the very
   beginning as the question of questions, for good or for evil. The
   original plan of the Infallibilists, to decide it by acclamation, had
   to be abandoned in view of a formidable opposition, which was developed
   inside and outside of the Council. The majority of the Bishops
   circulated, early in January, a monster petition, signed by 410 names,
   in favor of Infallibility. [301] The Italians and the Spaniards
   circulated similar petitions separately. Archbishop Spalding, of
   Baltimore, formerly an anti-Infallibilist, prepared an address offering
   some compromise to the effect that an appeal from the Pope to an
   oecumenical Council should be reproved. [302] But five
   counter-petitions, signed by very weighty names, in all 137,
   representing various degrees of opposition, but agreed as to the
   inopportunity of the definition, were sent in during the same month
   (Jan. 12 to 18) by German and Austrian, Hungarian, French, American,
   Oriental, and Italian Bishops. [303]

   The Pope received none of these addresses, but referred them to the
   Deputation on Faith. While in this he showed his impartiality, he did
   not conceal, in a private way, his real opinion, and gave it the weight
   of his personal character and influence. 'Faith in his personal
   infallibility,' says a well-informed Catholic, 'and belief in a
   constant and special communication with the Holy Ghost, form the basis
   of the character of Pius IX.' [304] In the Council itself, Archbishop
   Manning, the Anglican convert, was the most zealous, devout, and
   enthusiastic Infallibilist; he urged the definition as the surest means
   of gaining hesitating Anglo-Catholics and Ritualists longing for
   absolute authority; while his former teacher and friend, Dr. Pusey,
   feared that the new dogma would make the breach between Oxford and Rome
   wider than ever. Manning is 'more Catholic than Catholics' to the manor
   born, as the English settlers in Ireland were more Irish than Irishmen,
   [305] and is altogether worthy to be the successor of Pius IX. in the
   chair of St. Peter. Both these eminent and remarkable persons show how
   a sincere faith in a dogma, which borders on blasphemy, may, by a
   strange delusion or hallucination, be combined with rare purity and
   amiability of character.

   Besides the all-powerful aid of the Pope, whom no Bishop can disobey
   without fatal consequences, the Infallibilists had the great advantage
   of perfect unity of sentiment and aim; while the anti-Infallibilists
   were divided among themselves, many of them being simply
   inopportunists. They professed to agree with the majority in principle
   or practice, and to differ from them only on the subordinate question
   of definability and opportunity. [306] This qualified opposition had no
   weight whatever with the Pope, who was as fully convinced of the
   opportunity and necessity of the definition as he was of the dogma
   itself. [307] And even the most advanced anti-Infallibilists, as
   Kenrick, Hefele, and Strossmayer, were too much hampered by Romish
   traditionalism to plant their foot firmly on the Scriptures, which
   after all must decide all questions of faith.

   In the mean time a literary war on Infallibility was carried on in the
   Catholic Church in Germany, France, and England, and added to the
   commotion in Rome. A large number of pamphlets, written or inspired by
   prominent members of the Council, appeared for and against
   Infallibility. Distinguished outsiders, as Döllinger, Gratry,
   Hyacinthe, Montalembert, and others, mixed in the fight, and
   strengthened the minority. [308] A confidential communication of the
   intellectual leader of the Anglo-Catholic secession revealed the
   remarkable fact that some of the most serious minds were at that time
   oscillating between infallibilism and skepticism, and praying to the
   spirits of the fathers to deliver the Church from 'the great calamity'
   of a new dogma. [309]

   After preliminary skirmishes, the formal discussion began in earnest in
   the 50th session of the General Congregation, May 13, 1870, and lasted
   to the 86th General Congregation, July 16. About eighty Latin speeches
   [310] were delivered in the general discussion on the schema de Romano
   Pontifice, nearly one half of them on the part of the opposition, which
   embraced less than one fifth of the Council. When the arguments and the
   patience of the assembly were pretty well exhausted, the President, at
   the petition of a hundred and fifty Bishops, closed the general
   discussion on the third day of June. About forty more Bishops, who had
   entered their names, were thus prevented from speaking; but one of
   them, Archbishop Kenrick, of St. Louis, published his strong argument
   against Infallibility in Naples. [311] Then five special discussions
   commenced on the proemium and the four chapters. 'For the fifth or last
   discussion a hundred and twenty Bishops inscribed their names to speak;
   fifty of them were heard, until on both sides the burden became too
   heavy to bear; and, by mutual consent, a useless and endless
   discussion, from mere exhaustion, ceased.' [312]

   When the vote was taken on the whole four chapters of the Constitution
   of the Church, July 13, 1870, in the 85th secret session of the General
   Congregation (601 members being present), 451 voted Placet, 88 Non
   Placet, 62 Placet juxta modum, over 80 (perhaps 91), though present in
   Rome or in the neighborhood, abstained for various reasons from voting.
   [313] Among the negative votes were the Prelates most distinguished for
   learning and position, as Schwarzenberg, Cardinal Prince-Archbishop of
   Prague; Rauscher, Cardinal Prince-Archbishop of Vienna; Darboy,
   Archbishop of Paris; Matthieu, Cardinal-Archbishop of Besançon;
   Ginoulhiac, Archbishop of Lyons; Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans; Maret,
   Bishop of Sura (i. p.); Simor, Archbishop of Gran and Primate of
   Hungary; Haynald, Archbishop of Kalocsa; Förster, Prince-Bishop of
   Breslau; Scherr, Archbishop of Munich; Ketteler, Bishop of Mayence;
   Hefele, Bishop of Rottenburg; Strossmayer, Bishop of Bosnia and
   Sirmium; MacHale, Archbishop of Tuam; Connolly, Archbishop of Halifax;
   Kenrick, Archbishop of St. Louis.

   On the evening of the 13th of July the minority sent a deputation,
   consisting of Simor, Ginoulhiac, Scherr, Darboy, Ketteler, and Rivet,
   to the Pope. After waiting an hour, they were admitted at 9 o'clock in
   the evening. They asked simply for a withdrawal of the addition to the
   third chapter, which assigns to the Pope the exclusive possession of
   all ecclesiastical powers, and for the insertion, in the fourth
   chapter, of a clause limiting his infallibility to those decisions
   which he pronounces 'innixus testimonio ecclesiarum.' Pius returned the
   almost incredible answer: 'I shall do what I can, my dear sons, but I
   have not yet read the scheme; I do not know what it contains.' [314] He
   requested Darboy, the spokesman of the deputation, to hand him the
   petition in writing. Darboy promised to do so; and added, not without
   irony, that he would send with it the schema which the Deputation on
   Faith and the Legates had with such culpable levity omitted to lay
   before his Holiness, exposing him to the risk of proclaiming in a few
   days a decree he was ignorant of. Pius surprised the deputation by the
   astounding assurance that the whole Church had always taught the
   unconditional Infallibility of the Pope. Then Bishop Ketteler of
   Mayence implored the holy Father on his knees to make some concession
   for the peace and unity of the Church. [315] This prostration of the
   proudest of the German prelates made some impression. Pius dismissed
   the deputation in a hopeful temper. But immediately afterwards Manning
   and Senestrey (Bishop of Regensburg) strengthened his faith, and
   frightened him by the warning that, if he made any concession, he would
   be disgraced in history as a second Honorius.

   In the secret session on the 16th of July, on motion of some Spanish
   Bishops, an addition was inserted 'non autem ex consensu ecclesiæ,
   which makes the decree still more obnoxious. [316] On the same day
   Cardinal Rauscher, in a private audience, made another attempt to
   induce the Pope to yield, but was told, 'It is too late.'

   On the 17th of July fifty-six Bishops sent a written protest to the
   Pope, declaring that nothing had occurred to change their conviction as
   expressed in their negative vote; on the contrary, they were confirmed
   in it; yet filial piety and reverence for the holy Father would not
   permit them to vote Non Placet, openly and in his face, in a matter
   which so intimately concerned his person, and that therefore they had
   resolved to return forthwith to their flocks, which had already too
   long been deprived of their presence, and were now filled with
   apprehensions of war. Schwarzenberg, Matthieu, Simor, and Darboy head
   the list of signers. [317] On the evening of the same day not only the
   fifty-six signers, but sixty additional members of the opposition
   departed from Rome, promising to each other to make their future
   conduct dependent on mutual understanding.

   This was the turning-point: the opposition broke down by its own act of
   cowardice. They ought to have stood like men on the post of duty, and
   repeated their negative vote according to their honest convictions.
   They could thus have prevented the passage of this momentous decree, or
   at all events shorn it of its oecumenical weight, and kept it open for
   future revision and possible reversal. But they left Rome at the very
   moment when their presence was most needed, and threw an easy victory
   into the lap of the majority.

   When, therefore, the fourth public session was held, on the memorable
   18th of July (Monday), there were but 535 Fathers present, and of these
   all voted Placet, with the exception of two, viz., Bishop Riccio, of
   Cajazzo, in Sicily, and Bishop Fitzgerald, of Little Rock, Arkansas,
   who had the courage to vote Non Placet, but immediately, before the
   close of the session, submitted to the voice of the Council. In this
   way a moral unanimity was secured as great as in the first Council of
   Nicæa, where likewise two refused to subscribe the Nicene Creed, 'What
   a wise direction of Providence,' exclaimed the Civiltà cattolica, '535
   yeas against 2 nays. Only two nays, therefore almost total unanimity;
   and yet two nays, therefore full liberty of the Council. How vain are
   all attacks against the oecumenical character of this most beautiful of
   all Councils!'

   After the vote the Pope confirmed the decrees and canons on the
   Constitution of the Church of Christ, and added from his own
   inspiration the assurance that the supreme authority of the Roman
   Pontiff did not suppress but aid, not destroy but build up, and formed
   the best protection of the rights and interests of the Episcopate.
   [318]

   The days of the two most important public sessions of the Vatican
   Council, namely the first and the last, were the darkest and stormiest
   which Rome saw from Dec. 8, 1869, to the 18th of July, 1870. The
   Episcopal votes and the Papal proclamation of the new dogma were
   accompanied by flashes of lightning and claps of thunder from the
   skies, and so great was the darkness which spread over the Church of
   St. Peter, that the Pope could not read the decree of his own
   Infallibility without the artificial light of a candle. [319] This
   voice of nature was variously interpreted, either as a condemnation of
   Gallicanism and liberal Catholicism, or as a divine attestation of the
   dogma like that which accompanied the promulgation of the law from
   Mount Sinai, or as an evil omen of impending calamities to the Papacy.

   And behold, the day after the proclamation of the dogma, Napoleon III.,
   the political ally and supporter of Pius IX., unchained the furies of
   war, which in a few weeks swept away the Empire of France and the
   temporal throne of the infallible Pope. His own subjects forsook him,
   and almost unanimously voted for a new sovereign, whom he had
   excommunicated as the worst enemy of the Church. A German Empire arose
   from victorious battle-fields, and Protestantism sprung to the
   political and military leadership of Europe. About half a dozen
   Protestant Churches have since been organized in Rome, where none was
   tolerated before, except outside of the walls or in the house of some
   foreign embassador; a branch of the Bible Society was established,
   which the Pope in his Syllabus denounces as a pest; and a public debate
   was held in which even the presence of Peter at Rome was called in
   question. History records no more striking example of swift retribution
   of criminal ambition. Once before the Papacy was shaken to its base at
   the very moment when it felt itself most secure: Leo X. had hardly
   concluded the fifth and last Lateran Council in March, 1517, with a
   celebration of victory, when an humble monk in the North of Europe
   sounded the key-note of the great Reformation.

   What did the Bishops of the minority do? They all submitted, even those
   who had been most vigorous in opposing, not only the opportunity of the
   definition, but the dogma itself. Some hesitated long, but yielded at
   last to the heavy pressure. Cardinal Rauscher, of Vienna, published the
   decree already in August, and afterwards withdrew his powerful
   'Observations on the Infallibility of the Church' from the market;
   regarding this as an act of glorious self-denial for the welfare of the
   Church. Cardinal Schwarzenberg, of Prague, waited with the publication
   till Jan. 11, 1871, and shifted the responsibility upon his theological
   advisers. Bishop Hefele, of Rottenburg, who has forgotten more about
   the history of Councils than the infallible Pope ever knew, after
   delaying till April 10, 1871, submitted, not because he had changed his
   conviction, but, as he says, because 'the peace and unity of the Church
   is so great a good that great and heavy personal sacrifices may be made
   for it;' i.e., truth must be sacrificed to peace. Bishop Maret, who
   wrote two learned volumes against Papal Infallibility and in defense of
   Gallicanism, declared in his retractation that he 'wholly rejects every
   thing in his work which is opposed to the dogma of the Council,' and
   'withdraws it from sale.' Archbishop Kenrick yielded, but has not
   refuted his Concio habenda at non habita, which remains an irrefragable
   argument against the new dogma. Even Strossmayer, the boldest of the
   bold in the minority, lost his courage, and keeps his peace. Darboy
   died a martyr in the revolt of the communists of Paris, in April, 1871.
   In a conversation with Dr. Michaud, Vicar of St. Madeleine, who since
   seceded from Rome, he counseled external and official submission, with
   a mental reservation, and in the hope of better times. His successor,
   Msgr. Guibert, published the decrees a year later (April, 1872),
   without asking the permission of the head of the French Republic. Of
   those opponents who, though not members of the Council, carried as
   great weight as any Prelate, Montalembert died during the Council;
   Newman kept silence; Père Gratry, who had declared and proved that the
   question of Honorius 'is totally gangrened by fraud,' wrote from his
   death-bed at Montreux, in Switzerland (Feb. 1872), to the new
   Archbishop of Paris, that he submitted to the Vatican Council, and
   effaced 'every thing to the contrary he may have written.' [320]

   It is said that the adhesion of the minority Bishops was extorted by
   the threat of the Pope not to renew their 'quinquennial faculties'
   (facultates quinquennales), that is, the Papal licenses renewed every
   five years, permitting them to exercise extraordinary episcopal
   functions which ordinarily belong to the Pope, as the power of
   absolving from heresy, schism, apostasy, secret crime (except murder),
   from vows, duties of fasting, the power of permitting the reading of
   prohibited books (for the purpose of refutation), marrying within
   prohibited degrees, etc. [321]

   But, aside from this pressure, the following considerations
   sufficiently explain the fact of submission.

   1. Many of the dissenting Bishops were professedly anti-Infallibilists,
   not from principle, but only from subordinate considerations of
   expediency, because they apprehended that the definition would provoke
   the hostility of secular governments, and inflict great injury on
   Catholic interests, especially in Protestant countries. Events have
   since proved that their apprehension was well founded.

   2. All Roman Bishops are under an oath of allegiance to the Pope, which
   binds them 'to preserve, defend, increase, and advance the rights,
   honors, privileges, and authority of the holy Roman Church, of our lord
   the Pope, and his successors.'

   3. The minority Bishops defended Episcopal infallibility against Papal
   infallibility. They claimed for themselves what they denied to the
   Pope. Admitting the infallibility of an oecumenical Council, and
   forfeiting by their voluntary absence on the day of voting the right of
   their protest, they must either on their own theory accept the decision
   of the Council, or give up their theory, cease to be Roman Catholics,
   and run the risk of a new schism.

   At the same time this submission is an instructive lesson of the
   fearful spiritual despotism of the Papacy, which overrules the stubborn
   facts of history and the sacred claims of individual conscience. For
   the facts so clearly and forcibly brought out before and during the
   Council by such men as Kenrick, Hefele, Rauscher, Maret, Schwarzenberg,
   and Dupanloup, have not changed, and can never be undone. On the one
   hand we find the results of a life-long, conscientious, and thorough
   study of the most learned divines of the Roman Church, on the other
   ignorance, prejudice, perversion, and defiance of Scripture and
   tradition; on the one hand we have history shaping theology, on the
   other theology ignoring or changing history; on the one hand the just
   exercise of reason, on the other blind submission, which destroys
   reason and conscience. But truth must and will prevail at last.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [299] After quoting, in a mutilated form, the definition of the Council
   of Florence, whose genuineness is disputed (compare p. 97, note 1), the
   third chapter goes on: 'Docemus et declaramus, Ecclesiam Romanam,
   disponente Domino, super omnes alias ordinariæ potestatis obtinere
   principatum, et hanc Romani Pontificis jurisdictionis potestatem, quæ
   vere episcopalis est, immediatam esse, erga quam cujuscunque ritus et
   dignitatis pastores atque fideles, tam seorsum singuli quam simul
   omnes, officio hierarchicæ subordinationis veræque obedientiæ
   obstringuntur, non solum in rebus, quæ ad fidem et mores, sed etiam in
   iis, quæ ad disciplinam et regimen Ecclesiæ per totum orbem diffusæ
   pertinent; ita ut, custodita cum Romano Pontifice tam communionis quam
   ejusdem fidei professionis unitate, Ecclesiæ Christi sit unus grex sub
   uno summo pastore. Hæc est catholicæ veritatis doctrina, a qua deviare
   salva fide atque salute nemo potest. . . . Si quis itaque dixerit,
   Romanum Pontificem habere tantummodo officium inspectionis vel
   directionis, non autem plenam et supremam potestatem jurisdictionis in
   universam Ecclesiam, non solum in rebus, quæ ad fidem et mores, sed
   etiam in iis, quæ ad disciplinam et regimem Ecclesiæ per totum orbem
   diffusæ pertinent; aut eum habere tantum potiores partes, non vero
   totam plenitudinem hujus supremæ potestatis; aut hanc ejus potestatem
   non esse ordinariam et immediatam sive in omnes ac singulas ecclesias,
   sive in omnes et singulos pastores et fideles; anathema sit.'

   [300] ' Itaque Nos traditioni a fidei Christianæ exordio perceptæ
   fideliter inhoerendo, ad Dei Salvatoris nostri gloriam, religionis
   Catholicæ exaltationem et Christianorum populorum salutem, sacro

   declaramus: Romanum Pontificem, cum ex Cathedra loquitur, id est, cum
   omnium Christianorum Pastoris et Doctoris munere fungens pro suprema
   sua Apostolica auctoritate doctrinam de fide vel moribus ab universa
   Ecclesia tenendam definit, per assistentiam divinam, ipsi in beato
   Petro promissam, ea infallibilitate pollere, qua divinus Redemptor
   Ecclesiam suam in definienda doctrina de fide vel moribus instructam
   esse voluit; ideoque ejusmodi Romani Pontificis definitiones ex sese,
   non autem ex consensu Ecclesiæ, irreformabiles esse. 'Si quis autem
   huic Nostræ definitioni contradicere, quod Deus avertat, præsumpserit;
   anathema sit.'

   Infallibility was signed by Purcell, of Cincinnati; Kenrick, of St.
   Louis; McCloskey, of New York; Connolly, of Halifax; Bayley, of Newark
   (now Archbishop of Baltimore), and several others.

   [304] Ce qui se passe au Concile, p. 130. The writer adds that some of
   the predecessors of Pius have held his doctrines, but none has been so
   ardently convinced, none has professed them 'avec ce mysticisme
   enthousiaste, ce dédain pour les remontrances des savants et des sages,
   cette confiance impassible. Quel que soit le jugement de l'histoire,
   personne ne pourra nier que cette foi profonde ne lui ait créé dans le
   dix-neuvième siècle une personnalité d'une puissance et d'une majesté
   incomparables, dont l'éclat grandit encore un pontificat déjà si
   remarquable par une durée, des vertus et des malheurs vraiment
   exceptionnels.' Comp. the Discourses of Pius IX., in 2 vols., Rome,
   1873, and the review of Gladstone in the Quarterly Review for Jan.
   1875.

   [305] So Archbishop Kenrick, of St. Louis, characterized him in his
   Concio habenda at non habita. Quirinus (Appendix I. p. 832) quotes from
   a sermon of Manning, preached at Kensington, 1869, in the Pope's name,
   the following passage: 'I claim to be the Supreme Judge and director of
   the consciences of men--of the peasant that tills the field, and the
   prince that sits on the throne; of the household that lives in the
   shade of privacy, and the Legislature that makes laws for kingdoms. I
   am the sole last Supreme Judge of what is right and wrong.'

   [306] Only the address of the German Bishops took openly the ground
   that it would be difficult from internal reasons (viz., the
   contradiction of history and tradition) to proclaim Infallibility as a
   dogma of revelation. See Friedrich, Tagebuch, p. 126; and Frommann,
   Geschichte, p. 62.

   [307] On being asked whether he considered the definition of the dogma
   opportune, Pius IX. resolutely answered, 'No! but necessary.' He
   complained of the opposing Bishops, that, living among Protestants,
   they were infected by their freedom of thought, and had lost the true
   traditional feeling. Hase, p. 180.

   [308] See the literature in the next section, and in Friedberg, pp.
   33-44. Comp. Frommann, pp. 66 sqq.

   [309] Dr. John Henry Newman has, after long silence, retracted in 1875
   his letter of 1870, which, though confidential, found its way into
   public 'by permission,' and has given in his adherence to the Vatican
   decrees, yet with minimizing qualifications, and in a tone of sadness
   and complaint against those ultra-zealous infallibilists who 'have
   stated truths in the most paradoxical forms and stretched principles
   till they were close upon snapping, and who at length, having done
   their best to set the house on fire, leave to others the task of
   putting out the flame.' (See his Letter to the Duke of Norfolk, on
   occasion of Gladstone's Expostulation, Lond. 1875, p. 4.) Nevertheless
   that document deserves to be remembered for its psychological interest,
   and as a part of the inner history of the infallibility dogma a few
   months before its birth. 'Rome,' he wrote to Bishop Ullathorne, 'ought
   to be a name to lighten the heart at all times, and a Council's proper
   office is, when some great heresy or other evil impends, to inspire
   hope and confidence in the faithful; but now we have the greatest
   meeting which ever has been, and that at Rome, infusing into us by the
   accredited organs of Rome and of its partisans, such as the Civiltà
   (the Armonia), the Univers, and the Tablet, little else than fear and
   dismay. When we are all at rest, and have no doubts, and--at least
   practically, not to say doctrinally--hold the Holy Father to be
   infallible, suddenly there is thunder in the clearest sky, and we are
   told to prepare for something, we know not what, to try our faith, we
   know not how. No impending danger is to be averted, but a great
   difficulty is to be created. Is this the proper work for an oecumenical
   Council? As to myself personally, please God, I do not expect any trial
   at all; but I can not help suffering with the many souls who are
   suffering, and I look with anxiety at the prospect of having to defend
   decisions which may not be difficult to my own private judgment, but
   may be most difficult to maintain logically in the face of historical
   facts. What have we done to be treated as the faithful never were
   treated before? When has a definition de fide been a luxury of
   devotion, and not a stern, painful necessity? Why should an aggressive,
   insolent faction be allowed to "make the heart of the just sad, whom
   the Lord hath not made sorrowful?" Why can not we be let alone when we
   have pursued peace and thought no evil? I assure you, my lord, some of
   the truest minds are driven one way and another, and do not know where
   to rest their feet--one day determining "to give up all theology as a
   bad job," and recklessly to believe henceforth almost that the Pope is
   impeccable, at another tempted to "believe all the worst which a book
   like Janus says;" others doubting about "the capacity possessed by
   Bishops drawn from all corners of the earth to judge what is fitting
   for European society," and then, again, angry with the Holy See for
   listening to "the flattery of a clique of Jesuits, Redemptorists, and
   converts." Then, again, think of the store of Pontifical scandals in
   the history of eighteen centuries, which have partly been poured forth,
   and partly are still to come. What Murphy [a Protestant traveling
   preacher] inflicted upon us in one way, Mr.Veuillot is indirectly
   bringing on us in another. And then, again, the blight which is falling
   upon the multitude of Anglican Ritualists, etc., who themselves,
   perhaps--at least their leaders--may never become Catholics, but who
   are leavening the various English denominations and parties (far beyond
   their own range) with principles and sentiments tending towards their
   ultimate absorption into the Catholic Church. With these thoughts ever
   before me, I am continually asking myself whether I ought not to make
   my feelings public; but all I do is to pray those early doctors of the
   Church, whose intercession would decide the matter (Augustine, Ambrose,
   and Jerome, Athanasius, Chrysostom, and Basil), to avert this great
   calamity. If it is God's will that the Pope's infallibility be defined,
   then is it God's will to throw back "the times and moments" of that
   triumph which he has destined for his kingdom, and I shall feel I have
   but to bow my head to his adorable, inscrutable Providence. You have
   not touched upon the subject yourself, but I think you will allow me to
   express to you feelings which, for the most part, I keep to myself. . .

   Quirinus has substituted the English original as given here from the
   Standard, April 7, 1870.

   [311] Hence the title 'Concio habenda at non habita'--prepared for

   [312] Manning, Petri Privil. III. pp. 31, 32. He gives this
   representation to vindicate the liberty of the Council; but the
   minority complained of an arbitrary close of the discussion. They held
   an indignation meeting in the residence of Cardinal Rauscher, and
   protested 'contra violationem nostri juris,' but without effect. See

   II. pp. 426 sqq.; and Quirinus, Letter LXVI. pp. 778 sqq. Quirinus errs
   in counting the 91 (according to others, 85 or only 70) absentees among
   the 601. There were in all from 680 to 692 members present in Rome at
   the time. See Fessler, p. 89 (who states the number of absentees to be
   'over 80'), and Frommann, p. 201. The protest of the minority to the
   Pope, July 17, states the number of voters in the same way, except that
   70, instead of 91 or 85, is given as the number of absentees: 'Notum
   est Sanctitati Vestræ, 88 Patres fuisse, qui, conscientia urgente et
   amore s. Ecclesiæ permoti, suffragium suum per verba non placet
   emiserunt; 62 alios, qui suffragati sunt per verba placet juxta modum,
   denique 70 circiter qui a congregatione abfuerunt atque a suffragio
   emittendo abstinuerunt. Hic accedunt et alii, qui, infirmitatibus aut
   gravioribus rationibus ducti, ad suas dioeceses reversi sunt.'

   [314] He spoke in French: 'Te ferai mon possible, mes chers fils, mais
   je n'ai pas encore lu le schéma; je ne sais pas ce qu'il contient.'
   Quirinus, Letter LXIX. p. 800.

   [315] Quirinus, Letter LXIX. p. 801, gave, a few days afterwards, from
   direct information, the following fresh and graphic description of this
   interesting scene: 'Bishop Ketteler then came forward, flung himself on
   his knees before the Pope, and entreated for several minutes that the
   Father of the Catholic world would make some concession to restore
   peace and her lost unity to the Church and the Episcopate. It was a
   peculiar spectacle to witness these two men, of kindred and yet widely
   diverse nature, in such an attitude--the one prostrate on the ground
   before the other. Pius is "totus teres atque rotundus," firm and
   immovable, smooth and hard as marble, infinitely self-satisfied
   intellectually, mindless and ignorant; without any understanding of the
   mental conditions and needs of mankind, without any notion of the
   character of foreign nations, but as credulous as a nun, and, above
   all, penetrated through and through with reverence for his own person
   as the organ of the Holy Ghost, and therefore an absolutist from head
   to heel, and filled with the thought, "I, and none beside me." He knows
   and believes that the Holy Virgin, with whom he is on the most intimate
   terms, will indemnify him for the loss of land and subjects by means of
   the Infallibility doctrine, and the restoration of the Papal dominion
   over states and peoples as well as over churches. He also believes
   firmly in the miraculous emanations from the sepulchre of St. Peter. At
   the feet of this man the German Bishop flung himself, "ipso Papa
   papalior," a zealot for the ideal greatness and unapproachable dignity
   of the Papacy, and, at the same time, inspired by the aristocratic
   feeling of a Westphalian nobleman and the hierarchical
   self-consciousness of a Bishop and successor of the ancient chancellor
   of the empire, while yet he is surrounded by the intellectual
   atmosphere of Germany, and, with all his firmness of belief, is sickly
   with the pallor of thought, and inwardly struggling with the terrible
   misgiving that, after all, historical facts are right, and that the
   ship of the Curia, though for the moment it proudly rides the waves
   with its sails swelled by a favorable wind, will be wrecked on that
   rock at last.'

   [316] Quirinus, p. 804: 'Thus the Infallibilist decree, as it is now to
   be received under anathema by the Catholic world, is an eminently
   Spanish production, as is fitting for a doctrine which was born and
   reared under the shadow of the Inquisition.'

   [317] See the protest in Friedberg, p. 622. Comp. Frommann, p. 207.

   [318] ' Summa ista Romani Pontificis auctoritas, Venerabiles Fratres,
   non opprimit sed adjuvat, non destruit sed ædificat, et sæpissime
   confirmat in dignitate, unit in charitate, et Fratrum, scilicet
   Episcoporum, jura firmat atque tuetur. Ideoque illi, qui nunc judicant
   in commotione, sciant, non esse in commotione Dominum. Meminerint, quod
   paucis abhinc annis, oppositam tenentes sententiam, abundaverunt in
   sensu Nostro, et in sensu majoris partis hujus amplissimi Consessus,
   sed tunc judicaverunt in spiritu auræ lenis. Numquid in eodem judicio
   judicando duæ oppositæ possunt existere conscientiæ? Absît. Illuminet
   ergo Deus sensus et corda; et quoniam Ipse facit mirabilia magna solus,
   illuminet sensus et corda, ut omnes accedere possint ad sinum Patris,
   Christi Jesu in terris indigni Vicarii, qui eos amat, eos diligit, et
   exoptat unum esse cum illis; et ita simul in vinculo charitatis
   conjuncti proeliare possimus proelia Domini, ut non solum non irrideant
   nos inimici nostri, sed timeant potius, et aliquando arma malitiæ
   cedant in conspectu veritatis, sicque omnes cum D. Augustino dicere
   valeant: "Tu vocasti me in admirabile lumen tuum, et ecce video."'

   [319] Quirinus, Letter LXIX. p. 809. A Protestant eye-witness, Prof.
   Ripley, thus described the scene in a letter from Rome, published in
   the New York Tribune (of which he is one of the editors) for Aug. 11,
   1870: 'Rome, July 19.--Before leaving Rome I send you a report of the
   last scene of that absurd comedy called the OEcumenical Vatican
   Council. . . . It is at least a remarkable coincidence that the opening
   and closing sessions of the Council were inaugurated with fearful
   storms, and that the vigil of the promulgation of the dogma was
   celebrated with thunder and lightning throughout the whole of the
   night. On the 8th of last December I was nearly drowned by the floods
   of rain, which came down in buckets; yesterday morning I went down in
   rain, and under a frowning sky which menaced terrible storms later in
   the day. . . . Kyrie eleison we heard as soon as the mass was said, and
   the whole multitude joined in singing the plaintive measure of the
   Litany of the Saints, and then with equal fervor was sung Veni Creator,
   which was followed by the voice of a secretary reading in a high key
   the dogma. At its conclusion the names of the Fathers were called over,
   and Placet after Placet succeeded ad nauseam. But what a storm burst
   over the church at this moment! The lightning flashed and the thunder
   pealed as we have not heard it this season before. Every Placet seemed
   to be announced by a flash and terminated by a clap of thunder. Through
   the cupolas the lightning entered, licking, as it were, the very
   columns of the Baldachino over the tomb of St. Peter, and lighting up
   large spaces on the pavement. Sure, God was there--but whether
   approving or disproving what was going on, no mortal man can say.
   Enough that it was a remarkable coincidence, and so it struck the minds
   of all who were present. And thus the roll was called for one hour and
   a half, with this solemn accompaniment, and then the result of the
   voting was taken to the Pope. The moment had arrived when he was to
   declare himself invested with the attributes of God--nay, a God upon
   earth. Looking from a distance into the hall, which was obscured by the
   tempest, nothing was visible but the golden mitre of the Pope, and so
   thick was the darkness that a servitor was compelled to bring a lighted
   candle and hold it by his side to enable him to read the formula by
   which he deified himself. And then--what is that indescribable noise?
   Is it the raging of the storm above?--the pattering of hail-stones? It
   approaches nearer, and for a minute I most seriously say that I could
   not understand what that swelling sound was until I saw a cloud of
   white handkerchiefs waving in the air. The Fathers had begun with
   clapping--they were the fuglemen to the crowd who took up the notes and
   signs of rejoicing until the church of God was converted into a theatre
   for the exhibition of human passions. "Viva Pio Nono!" "Viva il Papa
   Infallibile!" "Viva il trionfo dei Cattolici!" were shouted by this
   priestly assembly; and again another round they had; and yet another
   was attempted as soon as the Te Deum had been sung and the benediction
   had been given.'

   The sinlessness of the Virgin Mary and the personal infallibility of
   the Pope are the characteristic dogmas of modern Romanism, the two test
   dogmas which must decide the ultimate fate of this system. Both were
   enacted under the same Pope, and both faithfully reflect his character.
   Both have the advantage of logical consistency from certain premises,
   and seem to be the very perfection of the Romish form of piety and the
   Romish principle of authority. Both rest on pious fiction and fraud;
   both present a refined idolatry by clothing a pure humble woman and a
   mortal sinful man with divine attributes. The dogma of the Immaculate
   Conception, which exempts the Virgin Mary from sin and guilt, perverts
   Christianism into Marianism; the dogma of Infallibility, which exempts
   the Bishop of Rome from error, resolves Catholicism into Papalism, or
   the Church into the Pope. The worship of a woman is virtually
   substituted for the worship of Christ, and a man-god in Rome for the
   God-Man in heaven. This is a severe judgment, but a closer examination
   will sustain it.

   The dogma of the Immaculate Conception, being confined to the sphere of
   devotion, passed into the modern Roman creed without serious
   difficulty; but the dogma of Papal Infallibility, which involves a
   question of absolute power, forms an epoch in the history of Romanism,
   and created the greatest commotion and a new secession. It is in its
   very nature the most fundamental and most comprehensive of of all
   dogmas. It contains the whole system in a nutshell. It constitutes a
   new rule of faith. It is the article of the standing or falling Church.
   It is the direct antipode of the Protestant principle of the absolute
   supremacy and infallibility of the Holy Scriptures. It establishes a
   perpetual divine oracle in the Vatican. Every Catholic may hereafter
   say, I believe--not because Christ, or the Bible, or the Church,
   but--because the infallible Pope has so declared and commanded.
   Admitting this dogma, we admit not only the whole body of doctrines
   contained in the Tridentine standards, but all the official Papal
   bulls, including the mediæval monstrosities of the Syllabus (1864), the
   condemnation of Jansenism, the bull 'Unam Sanctam' of Boniface VIII.
   (1302), which, under pain of damnation, claims for the Pope the double
   sword, the secular as well as the spiritual, over the whole Christian
   world, and the power to depose princes and to absolve subjects from
   their oath of allegiance. [322] The past is irreversibly settled, and
   in all future controversies on faith and morals we must look to the
   same unerring tribunal in the Vatican. Even oecumenical Councils are
   superseded hereafter, and would be a mere waste of time and strength.

   On the other hand, if the dogma is false, it involves a blasphemous
   assumption, and makes the nearest approach to the fulfillment of St.
   Paul's prophecy of the man of sin, who 'as God sitteth in the temple of
   God, showing himself off that he is God' (2 Thess. ii. 4).

   Let us first see what the dogma does not mean, and what it does mean.

   It does not mean that the Pope is infallible in his private opinions'
   on theology and religion. As a man, he may be a heretic (as Liberius,
   Honorius, and John XXII.), or even an unbeliever (as John XXIII., and,
   perhaps, Leo X.), and yet, at the same time, infallible as Pope, after
   the fashion of Balaam and Kaiphas.

   Nor does it mean that infallibility extends beyond the proper sphere of
   religion and the Church. The Pope may be ignorant of science and
   literature, and make grave mistakes in his political administration, or
   be misinformed on matters of fact (unless necessarily involved in
   doctrinal decisions), and yet be infallible in defining articles of
   faith. [323]

   Infallibility does not imply impeccability. And yet freedom from error
   and freedom from sin are so nearly connected in men's minds that it
   seems utterly impossible that such moral monsters as Alexander VI. and
   those infamous Popes who disgraced humanity during the Roman pornocracy
   in the tenth and eleventh centuries, should have been vicars of Jesus
   Christ and infallible organs of the Holy Ghost. If the inherent
   infallibility of the visible Church logically necessitates the
   infallibility of the visible head, it is difficult to see why the same
   logic should not with equal conclusiveness derive the personal holiness
   of the head from the holiness of the body.

   On the other hand, the dogma does mean that all official utterances of
   the Roman Pontiff addressed to the Catholic Church on matters of
   Christian faith and duty are infallibly true, and must be accepted with
   the same faith as the word of the living God. They are not simply final
   in the sense in which all decisions of an absolute government or a
   supreme court of justice are final until abolished or superseded by
   other decisions, [324] but they are irreformable, and can never be
   revoked. This infallibility extends over eighteen centuries, and is a
   special privilege conferred by Christ upon Peter, and through him upon
   all his legitimate successors. It belongs to every Pope from Clement to
   Pius IX., and to every Papal bull addressed to the Catholic world. It
   is personal, i.e., inherent in Peter and the Popes; it is independent,
   and needs no confirmation from the Church or an oecumenical Council,
   either preceding or succeeding; its decrees are binding, and can not be
   rejected without running the risk of eternal damnation. [325]

   Even within the narrow limits of the Vatican decision there is room for
   controversy on the precise meaning of the figurative term ex cathedra
   loqui, and the extent of faith and morals, viz., whether Infallibility
   includes only the supernatural order of revealed truth and duty, or
   also natural and political duties, and questions of mere history, such
   as Peter's residence in Koine, the number of oecumenical Councils, the
   teaching of Jansen and Quesnel, and other disputed facts closely
   connected with dogmas. But the main point is clear enough. The
   Ultramontane theory is established, Gallicanism is dead and buried.

   Ultramontanism and Gallicanism.

   The Vatican dogma is the natural completion of the Papal polity, as the
   dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary is the completion of the
   Papal cultus.

   If we compare the Papal or Ultramontane theory with the Episcopal or
   Gallican theory, it has the undeniable advantage of logical
   consistency. The two systems are related to each other like monarchy
   and aristocracy, or rather like absolute monarchy and limited monarchy.
   The one starts from the divine institution of the Primacy (Matt. xvi.
   18), and teaches the infallibility of the head; the other starts from
   the divine institution of the Episcopate (Matt. xviii. 18), and teaches
   the infallibility of the body and the superiority of an oecumenical
   Council over the Pope. Conceding once the infallibility of the
   collective Episcopate, we must admit, as a consequence, the
   infallibility of the Primacy, which represents the Episcopate, and
   forms its visible and permanent centre. If the body of the teaching
   Church can never err, the head can not err; and, vice versa, if the
   head is liable to error, the body can not be free from error. The
   Gallican theory is an untenable via media. It secures only a periodic
   and intermittent infallibility, which reveals itself in an oecumenical
   Council, and then relapses into a quiescent state; but the Ultramontane
   theory teaches an unbroken, ever living, and ever active infallibility,
   which alone can fully answer the demands of an absolute authority.

   To refute Papal infallibility is to refute also Episcopal
   infallibility; for the higher includes the lower. The Vatican Council
   is the best argument against the infallibility of oecumenical Councils,
   for it sanctioned a fiction, in open and irreconcilable contradiction
   to older oecumenical Councils, which not only assumed the possibility
   of Papal fallibility, but actually condemned a Pope as a heretic. The
   fifth Lateran Council (1512) declared the decrees of the Council of
   Pisa (1409) null and void; the Council of Florence denied the validity
   of the Council of Basle, and this denied the validity of the former.
   The Council of Constance condemned and burned John Hus for teaching
   evangelical doctrines; and this fact forced upon Luther, at the
   disputation with Eck at Leipzig, the conviction that even oecumenical
   Councils may err. Rome itself has rejected certain canons of
   Constantinople and Chalcedon, which put the Pope on a par with the
   Patriarch of Constantinople; and a strict construction of the Papal
   theory would rule out the old oecumenical Councils, because they were
   not convened nor controlled by the Pope; while the Greek Church rejects
   all Councils which were purely Latin.

   The Bible makes no provision and has no promise for an oecumenical
   Council. [326] The Church existed and flourished for more than three
   hundred years before such a Council was heard of. Large assemblies are
   often ruled by passion, intrigue, and worldly ambition (remember the
   complaints of Gregory of Nazianzum on the Synods of the Nicene age).
   Majorities are not necessarily decisive in matters of faith. Christ
   promised to be even with two or three who are gathered in his name
   (Matt. xviii. 20). Elijah and the seven thousand who had not bowed the
   knee to Baal were right over against the great mass of the people of
   Israel. Athanasius versus mundum represented the truth, and the world
   versus Athanasium was in error during the ascendency of Arianism. In
   the eighteenth century the Church, both Catholic and Protestant, was
   under the power of infidelity, and true Christianity had to take refuge
   in small communities. Augustine maintained that one Council may correct
   another, and attain to a more perfect knowledge of truth. The history
   of the Church is unintelligible without the theory of progressive
   development, which implies many obstructions and temporary diseases.
   All the attributes of the Church are subject to the law of gradual
   expansion and growth, and will not be finally complete till the second
   coming of our Lord.

   Papal Infallibility and Personal Responsibility.

   The Christian Church, as a divine institution, can never fail and never
   lose the truth. Christ has pledged his Spirit and life-giving presence
   to his people to the end of time, and even to two or three of his
   humblest disciples assembled in his name; yet they are not on that
   account infallible. He gave authority in matters of discipline to every
   local Church (Matt. xviii. 17); and yet no one claims infallibility to
   every congregation. The Holy Spirit will always guide believers into
   the truth, and the unerring Word of God can never perish. But local
   churches, like individuals, may fall into error, and be utterly
   destroyed from the face of the earth. The true Church of Christ always
   makes progress, and will go on conquering and to conquer to the end of
   the world. But the particular churches of Jerusalem, Antioch,
   Alexandria, Constantinople, Asia Minor, and North Africa, where once
   the Apostles and St. Augustine taught, have disappeared, or crumbled
   into ruin, or have been overrun by the false prophet.

   The truth will ever be within the reach of the sincere inquirer
   wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are rightly
   administered. God has revealed himself plainly enough for all purposes
   of salvation; and yet not so plainly as to supersede the necessity of
   faith, and to resolve Christianity into a mathematical demonstration.
   He has given us a rational mind to think and to judge, and a free will
   to accept or to reject. Christian faith is no blind submission, but an
   intelligent assent. It implies anxiety to inquire as well as
   willingness to receive. We are expressly directed to 'prove all things,
   and to hold fast that which is good' (1 Thess. v. 21); to try the
   spirits whether they are of God (1 John iv. 1), and to refuse obedience
   even to an angel from heaven if he preach a different gospel (Gal. i.
   8). The Beroean Jews are commended as being more noble than those of
   Thessalonica, because they received the Word with all readiness of
   mind, and yet searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were
   so (Acts xvii. 11). It was from the infallible Scriptures alone, and
   not from tradition, that Paul and Apollos reasoned, after the example
   of Christ, who appeals to Moses and the Prophets, and speaks
   disparagingly of the traditions of the elders as obscuring the Word of
   God or destroying its true effect. [327]

   In opposition to all this the Vatican dogma requires a wholesale
   slaughter of the intellect and will, and destroys the sense of personal
   responsibility. The fundamental error, the proton pseudos of Rome is
   that she identifies the true ideal Church of Christ with the empirical
   Church, and the empirical Church with the Romish Church, and the Romish
   Church with the Papacy, and the Papacy with the Pope, and at last
   substitutes a mortal man for the living Christ, who is the only and
   ever present head of the Church, 'which is his body, the fullness of
   him who filleth all in all.' Christ needs no vicar, and the very idea
   of a vicar implies the absence of the Master. [328]

   Papal Infallibility tested by Tradition.

   The dogma of Papal Infallibility is mainly supported by an inferential
   dogmatic argument derived from the Primacy of Peter, who, as the Vicar
   of Christ, must also share in his infallibility; or from the nature and
   aim of the Church, which is to teach men the way of salvation, and must
   therefore be endowed with an infallible and ever available organ for
   that purpose, since God always provides the means together with an end.
   A full-blooded Infallibilist, whose piety consists in absolute
   submission and devotion to his lord the Pope, is perfectly satisfied
   with this reasoning, and cares little or nothing for the Bible and for
   history, except so far as they suit his purpose. If facts disagree with
   his dogmas, all the worse for the facts. All you have to do is to
   ignore or to deny them, or to force them, by unnatural interpretations,
   into reluctant obedience to the dogmas. [329] But after all, even
   according to the Roman Catholic theory, Scripture and history or
   tradition are the two indispensable tests of the truth of a dogma. It
   has always been held that the Pope and the Bishops are not the creators
   and judges, but the trustees and witnesses of the apostolic deposit of
   faith, and that they can define and proclaim no dogma which is not well
   founded in primitive tradition, written or unwritten. According to the
   famous rule of Vincentius Lirinensis, a dogma must have three marks of
   catholicity: the catholicity of time (semper), of space (ubique), and
   of number (ab omnibus). The argument from tradition is absolutely
   essential to orthodoxy in the Roman sense, and, as hitherto held, more
   essential than Scripture proof. [330] The difference between Romanism
   and Protestantism on this point is this: Romanism requires proof from
   tradition first, from Scripture next, and makes the former
   indispensable, the latter simply desirable; while Protestantism
   reverses the order, and with its theory of the Bible as the only rule
   of faith and practice, and as an inexhaustible mine of truth that
   yields precious ore to every successive generation of miners, it may
   even dispense with traditional testimony altogether, provided that a
   doctrine can be clearly derived from the Word of God.

   Now it can be conclusively proved that the dogma of Papal
   Infallibility, like the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary,
   lacks every one of the three marks of catholicity. It is a
   comparatively modern innovation. It was not dreamed of for more than a
   thousand years, and is unknown to this day in the Greek Church, the
   oldest in the world, and in matters of antiquity always an important
   witness. The whole history of Christianity would have taken a different
   course, if in all theological controversies an infallible tribunal in
   Rome could have been invoked. [331] Ancient Creeds, Councils, Fathers,
   and Popes can be summoned as witnesses against the Vatican dogma.

   1. The four oecumenical Creeds, the most authoritative expressions of
   the old Catholic faith of the Eastern and Western Churches, contain an
   article on the 'holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,' but not one word
   about the Bishops of Rome, or any other local Church. How easy and
   natural, yea, in view of the fundamental importance of the
   Infallibility dogma, how necessary would have been the insertion of
   Roman after the other predicates of the Church, or the addition of the
   article: 'The Pope of Rome, the successor of Peter and infallible vicar
   of Christ.' If it had been believed then as now, it would certainly
   appear at least in the Roman form of the Apostles' Creed; but this is
   as silent on this point as the Aquilejan, the African, the Gallican,
   and other forms.

   And this uniform silence of all the oecumenical Creeds is strengthened
   by the numerous local Creeds of the Nicene age, and by the various
   ante-Nicene rules of faith up to Tertullian and Irenæus, not one of
   which contains an allusion to such an article of faith.

   2. The oecumenical Councils of the first eight centuries, which are
   recognized by the Greek and Latin Churches alike, are equally silent
   about, and positively inconsistent with, Papal Infallibility. They were
   called by Greek Emperors, not by Popes; they were predominantly, and
   some of them exclusively, Oriental; they issued their decrees in their
   own name, and in the fullness of authority, without thinking of
   submitting them to the approval of Rome; they even claimed the right of
   judging and condemning the Roman Pontiff, as well as any other Bishop
   or Patriarch.

   In the first Nicene Council there was but one representative of the
   Latin Church (Hosius of Spain); and in the second and the fifth
   oecumenical Councils there was none at all. The second oecumenical
   Council (381), in the third canon, put the Patriarch of Constantinople
   on a par with the Bishop of Rome, assigning to the latter only a
   primacy of honor; and the fourth oecumenical Council (451) confirmed
   this canon in spite of the energetic protest of Pope Leo I.

   But more than this: the sixth oecumenical Council, held 680, pronounced
   the anathema on Honorius, 'the former Pope of old Rome,' for teaching
   officially the Monothelite heresy; and this anathema was signed by all
   the members of the Council, including the three delegates of the Pope,
   and was several times repeated by the seventh and eighth Councils,
   which were presided over by Papal delegates. But we must return to this
   famous case again in another connection.

   3. The Fathers, even those who unconsciously did most service to Rome,
   and laid the foundation for its colossal pretensions, yet had no idea
   of ascribing absolute supremacy and infallibility to the Pope.

   Clement of Rome, the first Roman Bishop of whom we have any authentic
   account, wrote a letter to the Church at Corinth--not in his name, but
   in the name of the Roman Congregation; not with an air of superior
   authority, but as a brother to brethren--barely mentioning Peter, but
   eulogizing Paul, and with a clear consciousness of the great difference
   between an Apostle and a Bishop or Elder.

   Ignatius of Antioch, who suffered martyrdom in Rome under Trajan,
   highly as he extols Episcopacy and Church unity in his seven Epistles,
   one of which is addressed to the Roman Christians, makes no distinction
   of rank among Bishops, but treats them as equals.

   Irenæus of Lyons, the champion of the Catholic faith against the
   Gnostic heresy at the close of the second century, and the author of
   the famous and variously understood passage about the potentior
   principalitas (proteia) ecclesiæ Romanæ, sharply reproved Victor of
   Rome when he ventured to excommunicate the Asiatic Christians for their
   different mode of celebrating Easter, and told him that it was contrary
   to Apostolic doctrine and practice to judge brethren on account of
   eating and drinking, feasts and new moons. Cyprian, likewise a saint
   and a martyr, in the middle of the third century, in his zeal for
   visible and tangible unity against the schismatics of his diocese,
   first brought out the fertile doctrine of the Roman See as the chair of
   Peter and the centre of Catholic unity; yet with all his Romanizing
   tendency he was the great champion of the Episcopal solidarity and
   equality system, and always addressed the Roman Bishop as his 'brother'
   and 'colleague;' he even stoutly opposed Pope Stephen's view of the
   validity of heretical baptism, charging him with error, obstinacy, and
   presumption. He never yielded, and the African Bishops, at the third
   Council at Carthage (256), emphatically indorsed his opposition.
   Firmilian, Bishop of Cæsarea, and Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria,
   likewise bitterly condemned the doctrine and conduct of Stephen, and
   told him that in excommunicating others he only excommunicated himself.

   Augustine is often quoted by Infallibilists on account of his famous
   dictum, Roma locuta est, causa finita est. [332] But he simply means
   that, since the Councils of Mileve and Carthage had spoken, and Pope
   Innocent I. had acceded to their decision, the Pelagian controversy was
   finally settled (although it was, after all, not settled till after his
   death, at the Council of Ephesus). Had he dreamed of the abuse made of
   this utterance, [333] he would have spoken very differently. For the
   same Augustine apologized for Cyprian's opposition to Pope Stephen on
   the ground that the controversy had then not yet been decided by a
   Council, and maintained the view of the liability of Councils to
   correction and improvement by subsequent Councils. He moreover himself
   opposed Pope Zosimus, when, deceived by Pelagius, he declared him sound
   in the faith, although Pope Innocent I. had previously excommunicated
   him as a dangerous heretic. And so determined were the Africans, under
   the lead of Augustine (417 and 418), that Zosimus finally saw proper to
   yield and to condemn Pelagianism in his 'Epistula Tractoria.'

   Gregory I., or the Great, the last of the Latin Fathers, and the first
   of the mediæval Popes (590-604), stoutly protested against the
   assumption of the title oecumenical or universal Bishop on the part of
   the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria, and denounced this
   whole title and claim as blasphemous, anti-Christian, and devilish,
   since Christ alone was the Head and Bishop of the Church universal,
   while Peter, Paul, Andrew, and John, were members under the same Head,
   and heads only of single portions of the whole. Gregory would rather
   call himself 'the servant of the servants of God,' which, in the mouths
   of his successors, pretending to be Bishops of bishops and Lords of
   lords, has become a shameless irony. [334]

   As to the Greek Fathers, it would be useless to quote them, for the
   entire Greek Church in her genuine testimonies has never accepted the
   doctrine of Papal supremacy, much less of Papal Infallibility.

   4. Heretical Popes.--We may readily admit the rock-like stability of
   the Roman Church in the early controversies on the Trinity and the
   Divinity of Christ, as compared with the motion and changeability of
   the Greek churches during the same period, when the East was the chief
   theatre of dogmatic controversy and progress. Without some foundation
   in history, the Vatican dogma could not well have arisen. It would be
   impossible to raise the claim of infallibility in behalf of the
   Patriarchs of Jerusalem, or Antioch, or Alexandria, or Constantinople,
   among whom were noted Arians, Nestorians, Monophysites, Monothelites,
   and other heretics. Yet there are not a few exceptions to the rule; and
   as many Popes, in their lives, flatly contradicted their title of
   holiness, so many departed, in their views, from Catholic truth. That
   the Popes after the Reformation condemned and cursed Protestant truths
   well founded in the Scriptures, we leave here out of sight, and confine
   our reasoning to facts within the limits of Roman Catholic orthodoxy.

   The canon law assumes throughout that a Pope may openly teach heresy,
   or contumaciously contradict the Catholic doctrine; for it declares
   that, while he stands above all secular tribunals, yet he can be judged
   and deposed for the crime of heresy. [335] This assumption was so
   interwoven in the faith of the Middle Ages that even the most powerful
   of all Popes, Innocent III. (d. 1216), gave expression to it when he
   said that, though he was only responsible to God, he may sin against
   the faith, and thus become subject to the judgment of the Church. [336]
   Innocent IV. (d. 1254) speaks of heretical commands of the Pope, which
   need not be obeyed. When Boniface VIII. (d. 1303) declared that every
   creature must obey the Pope at the loss of eternal salvation, he was
   charged with having a devil, because he presumed to be infallible,
   which was impossible without witchcraft. Even Hadrian VI., in the
   sixteenth century, expressed the view, which he did not recant as Pope,
   that 'if by the Roman Church is understood its head, the Pope, it is
   certain that he can err even in matters of faith.'

   This old Catholic theory of the fallibility of the Pope is abundantly
   borne out by actual facts, which have been established again and again
   by Catholic scholars of the highest authority for learning and candor.
   We need no better proofs than those furnished by them.

   Zephyrinus (201-219) and Callistus (219-223) held and taught (according
   to the 'Philosophumena' of Hippolytus, a martyr and saint) the
   Patripassian heresy, that God the Father became incarnate and suffered
   with the Son.

   Pope Liberius, in 358, subscribed an Arian creed for the purpose of
   regaining his episcopate, and condemned Athanasius, 'the father of
   orthodoxy,' who mentions the fact with indignation.

   During the same period, his rival, Felix II., was a decided Arian; but
   there is a dispute about his legitimacy; some regarding him as an
   anti-Pope, although he has a place in the Romish Calendar of Saints,
   and Gregory XIII. (1582) confirmed his claim to sanctity, against which
   Baronius protested.

   In the Pelagian controversy, Pope Zosimus at first indorsed the
   orthodoxy of Pelagius and Celestius, whom his predecessor, Innocent I.,
   had condemned; but he yielded afterwards to the firm protest of St.
   Augustine and the African Bishops.

   In the Three-Chapter controversy, Pope Vigilius (538-555) showed a
   contemptible vacillation between two opinions: first indorsing; then, a
   year afterwards, condemning (in obedience to the Emperor's wishes) the
   Three Chapters (i.e., the writings of Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas);
   then refusing the condemnation; then, tired of exile, submitting to the
   fifth oecumenical Council (553), which had broken off communion with
   him; and confessing that he had unfortunately been the tool of Satan,
   who labors for the destruction of the Church. A long schism in the West
   was the consequence. Pope Pelagius II. (585) significantly excused this
   weakness by the inconsistency of St. Peter at Antioch.

   John XXII. (d. 1334) maintained, in opposition to Nicholas III. and
   Clement V. (d. 1314), that the Apostles did not live in perfect
   poverty, and branded the opposite doctrine of his predecessors as
   heretical and dangerous. He also held an opinion concerning the middle
   state of the righteous, which was condemned as heresy by the University
   of Paris.

   Contradictory opinions were taught by different Popes on the
   sacraments, on the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary (see p.
   123), on matrimony, and on the subjection of the temporal power to the
   Church. [337]

   But the most notorious case of an undeniably official indorsement of
   heresy by a Pope is that of Honorius I. (625-638), which alone is
   sufficient to disprove Papal Infallibility, according to the maxim:
   Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. [338] This case has been sifted to
   the very bottom before and during the Council, especially by Bishop
   Hefele and Père Gratry. The following decisive facts are established by
   the best documentary evidence:

   (1.) Honorius taught ex cathedra (in two letters to his heretical
   colleague, Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople) the Monothelite
   heresy, which was condemned by the sixth oecumenical Council, i.e., the
   doctrine that Christ had only one will, and not two (corresponding to
   his two natures). [339]

   (2.) An oecumenical Council, universally acknowledged in the East and
   in the West, held in Constantinople, 680, condemned and excommunicated
   Honorius, 'the former Pope of Old Rome,' as a heretic, who with the
   help of the old serpent had scattered deadly error. [340] The seventh
   oecumenical Council (787) and the eighth (869) repeated the anathema of
   the sixth.

   (3.) The succeeding Popes down to the eleventh century, in a solemn
   oath at their accession, indorsed the sixth oecumenical Council, and
   pronounced 'an eternal anathema' on the authors of the Monothelite
   heresy, together with Pope Honorius, because he had given aid and
   comfort to the perverse doctrines of the heretics. [341] The Popes
   themselves, therefore, for more than three centuries, publicly
   recognized, first, that an oecumenical Council may condemn a Pope for
   open heresy, and, secondly, that Pope Honorius was justly condemned for
   heresy. Pope Leo II., in a letter to the Emperor, strongly confirmed
   the decree of the Council, and denounced his predecessor Honorius as
   one who 'endeavored by profane treason to overthrow the immaculate
   faith of the Roman Church.' [342] The same Pope says, in a letter to
   the Spanish Bishops: 'With eternal damnation have been punished
   Theodore, Cyrus, Sergius--together with Honorius, who did not
   extinguish at the very beginning the flame of heretical doctrine, as
   was becoming to his apostolic authority, but nursed it by his
   carelessness.' [343]

   This case of Honorius is as clear and strong as any fact in Church
   history. [344] Infallibilists have been driven to desperate efforts.
   Some pronounce the acts of the Council, which exist in Greek and Latin,
   downright forgeries (Baronius); others, admitting the acts, declare the
   letters of Honoring forgeries, so that he was unjustly condemned by the
   Council (Bellarmin)--both without a shadow of proof; still others,
   being forced at last to acknowledge the genuineness of the letters and
   acts, distort the former into an orthodox sense by a non-natural
   exegesis, and thus unwillingly fasten upon oecumenical Councils and
   Popes the charge of either dogmatic ignorance and stupidity, or
   malignant representation. [345] Yet in every case the decisive fact
   remains that both Councils and Popes for several hundred years believed
   in the fallibility of the Pope, in flat contradiction to the Vatican
   Council. Such acts of violence upon history remind one of King James's
   short method with Dissenters: 'Only hang them, that's all.'

   5. The idea of Papal absolutism and Infallibility, like that of the
   sinlessness of Mary, can be traced to apocryphal origin. It is found
   first, in the second century, in the pseudo-Clementine Homilies, which
   contain a singular system of speculative Ebionism, and represent James
   of Jerusalem, the brother of the Lord, as the Bishop of Bishops, the
   centre of Christendom, and the general Vicar of Christ; he is the last
   arbiter, from whom there is no appeal; to him even Peter must give an
   account of his labors, and to him the sermons of Peter were sent for
   safe keeping. [346]

   In the Catholic Church the same idea, but transferred to the Bishop of
   Rome, is first clearly expressed in the pseudo-Isidorian Decretals,
   that huge forgery of Papal letters, which appeared in the middle of the
   ninth century, and had for its object the completion of the
   independence of the Episcopal hierarchy from the State, and the
   absolute power of the Popes, as the legislators and judges of all
   Christendom. Here the most extravagant claims are put into the mouths
   of the early Popes, from Clement (91) to Damasus (384), in the
   barbarous French Latin of the Middle Ages, and with such numerous and
   glaring anachronisms as to force the conviction of fraud even upon
   Roman Catholic scholars. One of these sayings is: 'The Roman Church
   remains to the end free from stain of heresy.' Soon afterwards arose,
   in the same hierarchical interest, the legend of the donation of
   Constantine and his baptism by Pope Silvester, interpolations of the
   writings of the Fathers, especially Cyprian and Augustine, and a
   variety of fictions embodied in the Gesta Liberii, and the Liber
   Pontificalis, and sanctioned by Gratianus (about 1150) in his Decretum,
   or collection of canons, which (as the first part of the Corpus juris
   canonici) became the code of laws for the whole Western Church, and
   exerted an extraordinary influence. By this series of pious frauds the
   mediæval Papacy, which was the growth of ages, was represented to the
   faith of the Church as a primitive institution of Christ, clothed with
   absolute and perpetual authority.

   The Popes since Nicholas I. (858-867), who exceeded all his
   predecessors in the boldness of his designs, freely used what the
   spirit of a hierarchical, superstitious, and uncritical age furnished
   them. They quoted the fictitious letters of their predecessors as
   genuine, the Sardican canon on appeals as a canon of Nicæa, and the
   interpolated sixth canon of Nicæa,' the Roman Church always had the
   primacy,' of which there is not a syllable in the original; and nobody
   doubted them. Papal absolutism was in full vigor from Gregory VII. to
   Boniface VIII. Scholastic divines, even Thomas Aquinas, deceived by
   these literary forgeries, began to defend Papal absolutism over the
   whole Church, and the Councils of Lyons (1274) and of Florence (1439)
   sanctioned it, although the Greeks soon afterwards rejected the false
   union based upon such assumption.

   But absolute power, especially of a spiritual kind, is invariably
   intoxicating and demoralizing to any mortal man who possesses it. God
   Almighty alone can bear it, and even he allows freedom to his rational
   creatures. The reminiscence of the monstrous period when the Papacy was
   a football in the hands of bold and dissolute women (904-962), or when
   mere boys, like Benedict IX. (1033), polluted the Papal crown with the
   filth of unnatural vices, could not be quite forgotten. The scandal of
   the Papal schism (1378 to 1409), when two and even three rival Popes
   excommunicated and cursed each other, and laid all Western Christendom
   under the ban, excited the moral indignation of all good men in
   Christendom, and called forth, in the beginning of the fifteenth
   century, the three Councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basle, which loudly
   demanded a reformation of the Church, in the head as well as in the
   members, and asserted the superiority of a Council over the Pope.

   The Council of Constance (1414-1418), the most numerous ever seen in
   the West, deposed two Popes--John XXIII. (the infamous Balthasar Cossa,
   who had been recognized by the majority of the Church), on the charge
   of a series of crimes (May 29, 1415), and Benedict XIII., as a heretic
   who sinned against the unity of the Church (July 26, 1417), [347] and
   elected a new Pope, Martin V. (Nov. 11, 1517), who had given his
   adhesion to the Council, though after his accession to power he found
   ways and means to defeat its real object, i.e., the reformation of the
   Church.

   This Council was a complete triumph of the Episcopal system, and the
   Papal absolutists and Infallibilists are here forced to the logical
   dilemma of either admitting the validity of the Council, or
   invalidating the election of Martin V. and his successors. Either
   course is fatal to their system. Hence there has never been an
   authoritative decision on the oecumenicity of this Council, and the
   only subterfuge is to say that the whole case is an extraordinary
   exception; but this, after all, involves the admission that there is a
   higher power in the Church over the Papacy.

   The Reformation shook the whole Papacy to its foundation, but could not
   overthrow it. A powerful reaction followed, headed by the Jesuits.
   Their General, Lainez, strongly advocated Papal Infallibility in the
   Council of Trent, and declared that the Church could not err only
   because the Pope could not err. But the Council left the question
   undecided, and the Roman Catechism ascribes infallibility simply to
   'the Catholic Church,' without defining its seat. Bellarmin advocated
   and formularized the doctrine, stating it as an almost general opinion
   that the Pope could not publicly teach a heretical dogma, and as a
   probable and pious opinion that Providence will guard him even against
   private heresy. Yet the same Bellarmin was witness to the innumerable
   blunders of the edition of the Latin Vulgate prepared by Sixtus V.,
   corrected by his own hand, and issued by him as the only true and
   authentic text of the sacred Scriptures, with the stereotyped forms of
   anathema upon all who should venture to change a single word; and
   Bellarmin himself gave the advice that all copies should be called in,
   and a new edition printed with a lying statement in the preface making
   the printers the scape-goats for the errors of the Pope! This whole
   business of the Vulgate is sufficient to explode Papal Infallibility;
   for it touches the very source of divine revelation. Other Italian
   divines, like Alphonsus Liguori, and Jesuitical text-books,
   unblushingly use long-exploded mediæval fictions and interpolations as
   a groundwork of Papal absolutism and Infallibility.

   It is not necessary to follow the progress of the controversy between
   the Episcopal and the Papal systems during the seventeenth and
   eighteenth centuries. It is sufficient to say that the greatest
   Catholic divines of France and Germany, including Bossuet and Möhler,
   together with many from other countries, down to the 88 protesting
   Bishops in the Vatican Council, were anti-Infallibilists; and that
   popular Catechisms of the Roman Church, extensively used till 1870,
   expressly denied the doctrine, which is now set up as an article of
   faith necessary to eternal salvation. [348]

   Papal Infallibility and the Bible.

   The Old Testament gives no tangible aid to the Infallibilists. The
   Jewish Church existed as a divine institution, and served all its
   purposes, from Abraham to John the Baptist, without an infallible
   tribunal in Jerusalem, save the written law and testimony, made
   effective from time to time by the living voice of inspired prophecy.
   Pious Israelites found in the Scriptures the way of life,
   notwithstanding the contradictory interpretations of rabbinical schools
   and carnal perversions of Messianic prophecies, fostered by a corrupt
   hierarchy. The Urim and Thummim [349] of the High-Priest has no doubt
   symbolical reference to some kind of spiritual illumination or oracular
   consultation, but it is of too uncertain interpretation to furnish an
   argument.

   The passages of the New Testament which are used by Roman divines in
   support of the doctrine of Infallibility may be divided into two
   classes: those which seem to favor the Episcopal or Gallican, and those
   which are made to prove the Papal or Ultramontane theory. It is
   characteristic that the Papal Infallibilists carefully avoid the
   former.

   1. To the first class belong John xiv. 16 sq.; xvi. 13-16, where Christ
   promises the Holy Ghost to his disciples that he may 'abide with them
   forever,' teach them 'all things,' bring to their remembrance all he
   had said to them, [350] and guide them 'into the whole truth;' [351]
   John xx. 21: 'As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. . . .
   Receive ye the Holy Ghost;' [352] Matt. xviii. 18: 'Whatever ye shall
   bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,' etc.; Matt. xxviii. 19, 20:
   'Go and disciple all nations . . . and lo, I am with you alway, even
   unto the end of the world.'

   These passages, which are addressed to all Apostles alike, to doubting
   Thomas as well as to Peter, prove indeed the unbroken presence of
   Christ and the Holy Ghost in the Church to the end of time, which is
   one of the most precious and glorious truths admitted by every true
   Christian. But, in the first place, the Church, which is here
   represented by the Apostles, embraces all true believers, laymen as
   well as Bishops. Secondly, the promise of Christ's presence implies no
   infallibility, for the same promise is given even to the smallest
   number of true believers (Matt. xviii. 20). Thirdly, if the passages
   prove infallibility at all, they would prove individual infallibility
   by continued inspiration rather than corporate infallibility by
   official succession; for every Apostle was inspired, and so far
   infallible; and this no Roman Catholic Bishop, though claiming to be a
   successor of the Apostles, pretends to be.

   2. The passages quoted by the advocates of the Papal theory are three,
   viz., Luke xxii. 31; Matt. xvi. 18; John xxi. 15. [353]

   We admit, at the outset, that these passages in their obvious meaning
   which is confirmed by the history of the Apostolic Church, assign to
   Peter a certain primacy among the Apostles: he was the leader and
   spokesman of them, and the chief agent of Christ in laying the
   foundations of his Church among the Jews and the Gentiles. This is
   significantly prophesied in the new name of Peter given to him. The
   history of Pentecost (Acts ii.) and the conversion of Cornelius (Acts
   x.) are the fulfillment of this prophecy, and furnish the key to the
   interpretation of the passages in the Gospels.

   This is the truth which underlies the colossal lie of the Papacy. For
   there is no Romish error which does not derive its life and force from
   some truth. [354] But beyond this we have no right to go. The position
   which Peter occupied no one can occupy after him. The foundation of the
   Church, once laid, is laid for all time to come, and the gates of Hades
   can not prevail against it. The New Testament is its own best
   interpreter. It shows no single example of an exercise of jurisdiction
   of Peter over the other Apostles, but the very reverse. He himself, in
   his Epistles, disowns and prophetically warns his fellow-presbyters
   against the hierarchical spirit; exhorting them, instead of being lords
   over God's heritage, to be ensamples to his flock (1 Pet. v. 1-4). Paul
   and John were perfectly independent of him, as the Acts and Epistles
   prove. Paul even openly administered to him a rebuke at Antioch. [355]
   At the Council of Jerusalem James seems to have presided, at all events
   he proposed the compromise which was adopted by the Apostles, Elders,
   and Brethren; Peter was indeed one of the leading speakers, but he
   significantly advocated the truly evangelical principle of salvation by
   faith alone, and protested against human bondage (Acts xv.; comp. Gal.
   ii.).

   The great error of the Papacy is that it perverts a primacy of honor
   into a supremacy of jurisdiction, a personal privilege into an official
   prerogative, and a priority of time into a permanent superiority of
   rank. And to make the above passages at all available for such purpose,
   it must take for granted, as intervening links of the argument, that
   which can not be proved from the New Testament nor from history, viz.,
   that Peter was Bishop of Rome; that he was there as Paul's superior;
   that he appointed a successor, and transferred to him his prerogatives.

   As to the passages separately considered, Matt. xvi., 'Thou art rock,'
   and John xxi., 'Feed my flock,' could at best only prove Papal
   absolutism, but not Papal Infallibility, of which they do not treat.
   [356] The former teaches the indestructibility of the Church in its
   totality (not of any individual congregation), but this is a different
   idea. The Council of Trent lays down 'the unanimous consent of the
   Fathers' as the norm and rule of all orthodox interpretation, as if
   exegetical wisdom had begun and ended with the divines of the first six
   centuries. But of the passage Matt. xvi., which is more frequently
   quoted by Popes and Papists than any other passage in the Bible, there
   are no less than five different patristic interpretations; the rock on
   which Christ built his Church being referred to Christ by sixteen
   Fathers (including Augustine); to the faith or confession of Peter by
   forty-four (including Chrysostom, Ambrose, Hilary, Jerome, and
   Augustine again); to Peter professing the faith by seventeen; to all
   the Apostles, whom Peter represented by his primacy, by eight; to all
   the faithful, who, believing in Christ as the Son of God, are
   constituted the living stones of the Church. [357] But not one of the
   Fathers finds Papal Infallibility in this passage, nor in John xxi. The
   'unanimous consent of the Fathers' is a pure fiction, except in the
   most general and fundamental principles held by all Christians; and not
   to interpret the Bible except according to the unanimous consent of the
   Fathers, would strictly mean not to interpret it at all. [358]

   There remains, then, only the passage recorded by Luke (xxii. 31, 32)
   as at all bearing on the disputed question: 'Simon, Simon, behold,
   Satan desired to have you (or, obtained you by asking), that he may
   sift you as wheat; but I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and
   thou, when once thou art converted (or, hast turned again), strengthen
   thy brethren.' But even this does not prove infallibility, and has not
   been so understood before Popes Leo I. and Agatho. For (1) the passage
   refers, as the context shows, to the peculiar personal history of Peter
   during the dark hour of passion, and is both a warning and a comfort to
   him. So it is explained by the Fathers, who frequently quote it. (2)
   Faith here, as nearly always in the New Testament, means personal trust
   in, and attachment to, Christ, and not, as the Romish Church
   misinterprets it, orthodoxy, or intellectual assent to dogmas. (3) If
   the passage refers to the Popes at all, it would prove too much for
   them, viz., that they, like Peter, denied the Saviour, were converted
   again, and strengthened their brethren--which may be true enough of
   some, but certainly not of all. [359]

   The constant appeal of the Roman Church to Peter suggests a significant
   parallel. There is a spiritual Peter and a carnal Simon, who are
   separated, indeed, by regeneration, yet, after all, not so completely
   that the old nature does not occasionally re-appear in the new man.

   It was the spiritual Peter who forsook all to follow Christ; who first
   confessed him as the Son of God, and hence was called Rock; who after
   his terrible fall wept bitterly; was re-instated and intrusted with the
   care of Christ's sheep; who on the birthday of the Church preached the
   first missionary sermon, and gathered in the three thousand converts;
   who in the Apostles' Council protested against the narrow bigotry of
   the Judaizers, and stood up with Paul for the principle of salvation by
   grace alone through faith in Christ; who, in his Epistles, warns all
   ministers against hierarchical pride, and exhibits a wonderful
   meekness, gentleness, and humility of spirit, showing that divine grace
   had overruled and sanctified to him even his fall; and who followed at
   last his Master to the cross of martyrdom.

   It was the carnal Simon who presumed to divert his Lord from the path
   of suffering, and drew on him the rebuke, 'Get thee behind me, Satan;
   thou art a stumbling-block unto me, for thou mindest not the things of
   God, but the things of men;' the Simon, who in mistaken zeal used the
   sword and cut off the ear of Malchus; who proudly boasted of his
   unswerving fidelity to his Master, and yet a few hours afterwards
   denied him thrice before a servant-woman; who even after the
   Pentecostal illumination was overcome by his natural weakness, and,
   from policy or fear of the Judaizing party, was untrue to his better
   conviction, so as to draw on him the public rebuke of the younger
   Apostle of the Gentiles. The Romish legend of Domine quo vadis makes
   him relapse into his inconstancy even a day before his martyrdom, and
   memorializes it in a chapel outside of Rome.

   [In 1868, Cardinal Manning and Bishop Senestry of Regensburg, while in
   Rome, made a vow "to do all in our power to bring about the definition
   of papal infallibility," the vow being attested by the Jesuit father
   Liberatore. See Purcell: Life of Manning, II., 420. Commer, theological
   professor in Vienna, in an address on the twenty-fifth anniversary of
   Leo XIII.'s pontificate, announced that the Roman pontiff had properly
   been called by Catherine of Siena another Christ--alter Christus. The
   Manual of the Catechism of Pius X. quotes with approval that the pope
   is Jesus Christ on earth--il papa è Gesu Cristo sulla terra.--Ed.]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [322] This bull has been often disowned by Catholics (e.g., by the
   Universities of Sorbonne, Louvain, Alcala, Salamanca, when officially
   asked by Mr. Pitt, Prime Minister of Great Britain, 1788, also by
   Martin John Spalding, Archbishop of Baltimore, in his Lectures on
   Evidences, 1866), and, to some extent, even by Pius IX. (see Friedberg,
   p. 718), but it is unquestionably official, and was renewed and
   approved by the fifth Lateran Council, Dec. 19, 1516. Paul III. and
   Pius V. acted upon it, the former in excommunicating and deposing Henry
   VIII. of England, the latter in deposing Queen Elizabeth, exciting her
   subjects to rebellion, and urging Philip of Spain to declare war
   against her (see the Bullarium Rom., Camden, Burnet, Froude, etc.). The
   Papal Syllabus sanctions it by implication, in No. 23, which condemns
   as an error the opinion that Roman Pontiffs have exceeded the limits of
   their power.

   [323] Pope Pius IX. started as a political reformer, and set in motion
   that revolution which, notwithstanding his subsequent reactionary
   course, resulted in the unification of Italy and the loss of the States
   of the Church, against which he now so bitterly protests.

   [324] In this general sense Joseph de Maistre explains infallibility to
   be the same in the spiritual order that sovereignty means in the civil
   order: 'L'un et l'autre expriment cette haute puissance qui les domine
   toutes, dont toutes les autres dérivent, qui gouverne et n'est pas
   gouvernée, qui juge et n'est pas jugée. Quand nous disons que l'Eglise
   est infaillible, nous ne demandons pour elle, il est bien essentiel de
   l'observer, aucun privilége particulier; nous demandons seulement
   qu'elle jouisse du droit commun à toutes les souverainetés possible qui
   toutes agissent néssairement comme infaillibles; car tout gouvernement
   est absolu; et du moment où l'on peut lui résister sous prétexte
   d'erreur ou d'injustice, il n'existe plus.' Du Pape, ch. i., pp. 15,
   16.

   [325] Archbishop Manning (Petri Privil. III. pp. 112, 113) defines the
   doctrine of Infallibility in this way:

   '1. The privilege of infallibility is personal, inasmuch as it attaches
   to the Roman Pontiff, the successor of Peter, as a public person,
   distinct from, but inseparably united to, the Church; but it is not
   personal, in that it is attached, not to the private person, but to the
   primacy which he alone possesses.

   '2. It is also independent, inasmuch as it does not depend upon either
   the Ecclesia docens or the Ecclesia discens; but it is not independent,
   in that it depends in all things upon the divine head of the Church,
   upon the institution of the primacy by him, and upon the assistance of
   the Holy Ghost.

   '3. It is absolute, inasmuch as it can be circumscribed by no human or
   ecclesiastical law; it is not absolute, in that it is circumscribed by
   the office of guarding, expounding, and defending the deposit of
   revelation.

   '4. It is separate in no sense, nor can be, nor can be so called,
   without manifold heresy, unless the word be taken to mean distinct. In
   this sense, the Roman Pontiff is distinct from the Episcopate, and is a
   distinct subject of infallibility; and in the exercise of his supreme
   doctrinal authority, or magisterium, he does not depend for the
   infallibility of his definitions upon the consent or consultation of
   the Episcopate, but only on the divine assistance of the Holy Ghost.'

   [326] The Synod of Jerusalem, composed of Apostles, Elders, and
   Brethren, and legislating in favor of Christian liberty, differs very
   widely from a purely hierarchical Council, which excludes Elders and
   Brethren, and imposes new burdens upon the conscience.

   [327] It is remarkable that Christ always uses paradosis in an
   unfavorable sense: see Matt. xv. 2, 3, 6; Mark vii. 3, 5, 8, 9, 13. So
   also Paul: Gal. i. 14; Col. ii. 8; while in 1 Cor. xi. 2, and 2 Thess.
   ii. 15; iii. 6, he uses the term in a good sense, as identical with the
   gospel he preached.

   [328] I add here what Dr. Hodge, of Princeton, says on the Papal theory
   of Infallibility (Systematic Theology, New York, 1872, Vol. I. pp. 130,
   150): 'There is something simple and grand in this theory. It is
   wonderfully adapted to the tastes and wants of men. It relieves them of
   personal responsibility. Every thing is decided for them. Their
   salvation is secured by merely submitting to be saved by an infallible,
   sin-pardoning, and grace-imparting Church. Many may be inclined to
   think that it would have been a great blessing had Christ left on earth
   a visible representative of himself, clothed with his authority to
   teach and govern, and an order of men dispersed through the world
   endowed with the gifts of the original Apostles--men every where
   accessible, to whom we could resort in all times of difficulty and
   doubt, and whose decisions could be safely received as the decisions of
   Christ himself. God's thoughts, however, are not as our thoughts. We
   know that when Christ was on earth men did not believe or obey him. We
   know that when the Apostles were still living, and their authority was
   still confirmed by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of
   the Holy Ghost, the Church was distracted by heresies and schisms. If
   any in their sluggishness are disposed to think that a perpetual body
   of infallible teachers would be a blessing, all must admit that the
   assumption of infallibility by the ignorant, the erring, and the
   wicked, must be an evil inconceivably great. The Romish theory, if
   true, might be a blessing; if false, it must be an awful curse. That it
   is false may be demonstrated to the satisfaction of all who do not wish
   it to be true, and who, unlike the Oxford tractarian, are not
   determined to believe it because they love it. . . . If the Church be
   infallible, its authority is no less absolute in the sphere of social
   and political life. It is immoral to contract or to continue an
   unlawful marriage, to keep an unlawful oath, to enact unjust laws, to
   obey a sovereign hostile to the Church. The Church, therefore, has the
   right to dissolve marriages, to free men from the obligations of their
   oaths, and citizens from their allegiance, to abrogate civil laws, and
   to depose sovereigns. These prerogatives have not only been claimed,
   but time and again exercised by the Church of Rome. They all of right
   belong to that Church, if it be infallible. As these claims are
   enforced by penalties involving the loss of the soul, they can not be
   resisted by those who admit the Church to be infallible. It is obvious,
   therefore, that where this doctrine is held there can be no liberty of
   opinion, no freedom of conscience, no civil or political freedom. As
   the recent oecumenical Council of the Vatican has decided that this
   infallibility is vested in the Pope, it is henceforth a matter of faith
   with Romanists, that the Roman Pontiff is the absolute sovereign of the
   world. All men are bound, on the penalty of eternal death, to believe
   what he declares to be true, and to do whatever he decides is
   obligatory.'

   [329] Archbishop Manning (III. p. 118) speaks of history as 'a
   wilderness without guide or path,' and says: 'Whensoever any doctrine
   is contained in the divine revelation of the Church' [the very point
   which can not be proved in the case before us], 'all difficulties from
   human history are excluded, as Tertullian lays down, by prescription.
   The only source of revealed truth is God; the only channel of his
   revelation is the Church. No human history can declare what is
   contained in that revelation. The Church alone can determine its
   limits, and therefore its contents.'

   [330] This Archbishop Kenrick, in his Concio, frankly admits: 'Irenæi,
   Tertulliani, Augustini, Vincentii Lirinensis exempla secutus, fidei
   Catholicæ probationes ex traditione potius quam ex Scripturarum
   interpretatione quærendas duxi; quæ interpretatio, juxta Tertullianum
   magis apta est ad veritatem obumbitandum quam demonstrandum.'

   [331] 'Die ganze Geschichte des ersten Jahrtausends der Kirche wäre
   eine andere gewesen, wenn in dem Bischof von Rom das Bewusstsein, in
   der Kirche auch nur eine Ahnung davon gewesen wäre, dass dort ein Quell
   unfehlbarer Wahrheit fliesse. Statt all der bittern, verstörenden
   Kämpfe gegen wirkliche oder vermeintliche Häretiker, gegen die man
   Bücher schrieb und Synoden aller Art versammelte, würden alle
   Wohlmeinende sich auf den unfehlbaren Spruch des Papstes berufen haben,
   und mehr als einst das Orakel des Apollo zu Delphi würde das zu Rom
   befragt worden sein. Dagegen war es in jenen Jahrhunderten, als alles
   Christenthum auf die Spitze eines Dogmas gestellt wurde, nichts
   unerhörtes, dass auch ein Papst vor der subtilen Bestimmung des
   siegenden Dogma zum Häretiker wurde.' Hase, Polemik, Buch I. c.iv. p.
   161.

   [332] Or in a modified form: 'Causa finita est, utinam aliquando
   finiatur error!' Serm. 131, c. 10. See Janus, Rauscher, von Schulte
   versus Cardoni and Hergenröther, quoted by Frommann, p. 424.

   [333] As well as some other of his sententious sayings. His explanation
   of coge intrare was made to justify religious persecutions, from which
   his heart would have shrunk in horror.

   [334] The passages of Gregory on this subject are well known to every
   scholar. And yet the Vatican decree, in ch. iii., by omitting the
   principal part, makes him say almost the very opposite.

   [335] Decret. Gratian. Dist. xl. c. 6, in conformity with the sentence
   of Hadrian II.: 'Cunctos ipsos judicaturus [Papa], a nemine est
   judicandus, nisi deprehendatur a fide devius.' See on this point
   especially von Schulte, Concilien, pp. 188 sqq.

   [336] Serm. II. de consecrat. Pontificis: 'In tantum mihi fides
   necessaria est, cum de cæteris peccatis Deum judicem habeam, ut propter
   solum peccatum quod in fidem committitur, possim ab Ecclesia judicari.'

   [337] See examples under this head in Janus, pp. 54 sqq. (Irrthümer and
   Widersprüche der Päpste), p. 51 of the London ed.

   [338] Or, as Perrone, himself an Infallibilist, who in his Dogmatic
   Theology characteristically treats of the Pope before the Holy
   Scriptures and tradition, puts it: 'Si vel unicus ejusmodi error
   deprehenderetur, appareret omnes adductas probationes in nihilum
   redactum iri.'

   [339] Honorius prescribed the technical term of the Monothelites as a
   dogma to the Church (dogma ecclesiasticum). In a reply to the
   Monothelite Patriarch Sergius of Constantinople, which is still extant
   in Greek and Latin (Mansi, Coll. Concil. Tom. XI. pp. 538 sqq.), he
   approves of his heretical view, and says as clearly as words can make
   it: 'Therefore we confess also one will (hen thelema) of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, since the Godhead has assumed our nature, but not our guilt.'
   In a second letter to Sergius, of which we have two fragments (Mansi,
   l.c. p. 579), Honorius rejects the orthodox term two energies (duo
   energeiai, duæ operationes), which is used alongside with two wills
   (duo thelemata, voluntates). Christ, he reasons, assumed human nature
   as it was before the fall, when it had not a law in the members which
   resists the law of the Spirit. He knew only a sinful human will. The
   Catholic Church rejects Monothelitism, or the doctrine of one will of
   Christ, as involving or necessarily leading to Monophysitism, i.e., the
   doctrine that Christ had but one nature; for will is an attribute of
   nature, not of the person. The Godhead has three persons, but only one
   nature, and only one will. Christ has two wills, because he has two
   natures. The compromise formula of Emperor Heraclius and Patriarch
   Sergius of Constantinople endeavored to reconcile the Monophysites with
   the orthodox Church by teaching that Christ had two natures, but only
   one will and one energy.

   [340] Sessio XVI.: 'Sergio hæretico anathema, Cyro hæretico anathema,
   Honorio hæretico anathema.' . . . Sessio XVIII.: 'Honorius, qui fuit
   Papa antiquæ Romæ . . . non vacavit . . . Ecelesiæ erroris scandalum
   suscitare unius voluntatis, et unius operationis in duabus naturis
   unius Christi,' etc. See Mansi, Conc. Tom. XI. pp. 622, 635, 655, 666.

   [341] 'Quia pravis hæreticorum assertionibus fomentum impendit.' This
   Papal oath was probably prescribed by Gregory II. (at the beginning of
   the eighth century), and is found in the Liber Diurnus (the book of
   formularies of the Roman chancery from the fifth to the eleventh
   century), edited by Eugène de Rozière, Paris, 1869, No. 84. The Liber
   Pontificalis agrees with the Liber Diurnus. Editions of the Roman
   Breviary down to the sixteenth century reiterated the charge against
   Honorius, since silently dropped.

   [342] ' Nec non et Honorium [anathematizamus], qui hanc apostolicam
   ecclesiam non apostolicæ traditionis doctrina lustravit, sed profana
   proditione immaculatam fidem subvertere conatus est.' Mansi, Tom. XI.
   p. 731.

   [343] 'Cum Honorio, qui flammam hæeretici dogmatis, non ut decuit
   apostolicam auctoritatem, incipientem extinxit, sed negligendo
   confovit.' Mansi, p. 1052.

   [344] Comp. especially the tract of Bishop Hefele, above quoted. The
   learned author of the History of the Councils has proved the case as
   conclusively as a mathematical demonstration.

   [345] So Perrone, in his Dogmatics, and Pennachi, in his Liber de
   Honorii I. Rom. Pont. causa, 1870, which is effectually disposed of by
   Hefele in an Appendix to the German edition of his tract. Nevertheless,
   Archbishop Manning, sublimely ignoring all but Infallibilist
   authorities on Honorius, has the face to assert (III. p. 223) that the
   case of Honorius is doubtful; that he defined no doctrine whatever; and
   that his two epistles are entirely orthodox! Is Manning more infallible
   than the infallible Pope Leo II., who denounced Honorius ex cathedra as
   a heretic?

   [346] See my Church History, Vol. I. § 69, p. 219, and the tract of
   Lutterbeck above quoted.

   [347] The third anti-Pope, Gregory XII., resigned.

   [348] So Overberg's Katechismus, III. Hauptstück, Fr. 349: 'Müssen wir
   auch glauben, dass der Papst unfehlbar ist? Nein, dies ist kein
   Glaubensartikel.' Keenan's Controversial Catechism, in the editions
   before 1871, declared Papal Infallibility to be 'a Protestant
   invention.' The Irish Bishops--Doyle, Murray, Kelly--affirmed under
   oath, before a Committee of the English Parliament in 1825, that the
   Papal authority is limited by Councils, that it does not extend to
   civil affairs and the temporal rights of princes, and that Papal
   decrees are not binding on Catholics without the consent of the whole
   Church, either dispersed or assembled in Council. See the original in
   the Appendix to Archbishop Kenrick's Concio in Friedrich's Documenta,
   I. pp. 228-242. But the Irish Catholics, who almost believe in the
   infallibility of their priests, can be very easily taught to believe in
   the infallibility of the Pope.

   [349] That is, delosis kai aletheia, doctrina et veritas, Ex. xxviii.
   15-30; Deut. xxxiii. 8, 9; 1 Sam. xxviii. 6. The Urim and Thummim were
   inscribed on the garment of Aaron. Some interpreters identify them with
   the twelve stones on which the names of the tribes of Israel were
   engraved; others regard them as a plate of gold with the sacred name of
   Jehovah; still others as polished diamonds, in form like dice, which,
   being thrown on the table or Ark of the Covenant, were consulted as an
   oracle. See the able article of Plumptre, in Smith's Bible Dictionary,
   Vol. IV. pp. 3356 sqq. (Am. ed.).

   [350] The panta implies a strong argument for the completeness of
   Christ's revelation in the New Testament against the Romish doctrine of
   addition.

   [351] The phrase eis ten aletheian pasan (John xvi. 13), or, according
   to another reading, en te aletheia pase (test. rec. eis pasan ten
   aletheian), expresses the truth as taught by Christ in its
   completeness--the whole truth--and proves likewise the sufficiency of
   the Scriptures. The A.V. and its predecessors ('into all truth'), also
   Luther (in alle Wahrheit, instead of die ganze or volle Wahrheit), miss
   the true sense by omitting the article, and conveying the false idea
   that the Holy Ghost would impart to all the apostles a kind of
   omniscience. Comp. my annotations to Lange's John on the passages (pp.
   445, 478, etc.).

   [352] Literally: 'Receive Holy Spirit'--labete pneuma hagion. The
   absence of the article may indicate a partial or preparatory
   inspiration as distinct from the full Pentecostal effusion.

   [353] Perrone and the Vatican decree on Infallibility confine
   themselves to these passages.

   [354] Augustine says somewhere: 'Nulla falsa doctrina est, quæ non
   aliquid veri permisceat.'

   [355] This fact is so obnoxious to Papists that some of them doubt or
   deny that the Cephas of Galatians ii. 11 was the Apostle Peter,
   although the New Testament knows no other. So Perrone, who also
   asserts, from his own preconceived theory, not from the text, that Paul
   withstood Peter from respectful love as an inferior to a superior, but
   not as a superior to an inferior! Let any Bishop try the same
   experiment against the Pope, and he will soon be sent to perdition.

   [356] For a full discussion of Petros and petra, see my edition of
   Lange's Comm. on Matt. xvi. 18, pp. 203 sqq.; and on the Romish
   perversion of the boskein and poimainein ta arnia, probata and probatia
   into a katakureiuein, and even withdrawal of nourishment, see my ed. of
   Lange on John, pp. 638 sqq.

   [357] This patristic dissensus was brought out during the Council in
   the Questio distributed by Bishop Ketteler with all the proofs; see
   Friedrich, Docum. I. pp. 6 sqq. Kenrick in his speech makes use of it.
   Comp. also my annotations to Lange's Comm. on Matthew in loco.

   [358] Even Kenrick confesses that it is doubtful whether any instance
   of that unanimous consent can be found (in his Concio, see Friedr.
   Docum. I. p.195): 'Regula interpetrandi Scripturas nobis imposita, hæc
   est: eas contra unanimem Patrum consensum non interpetrari. Si unquam
   detur consensus iste unanimis dubitari possit. Eo tamen deficiente,
   regula ista videtur nobis legem imponere majorem, qui ad unanimitatem
   accedere videretur, patrum numerum, in suis Scripturæ
   interpretationibus sequendi.'

   [359] This logical inference is also noticed by Archbishop Kenrick
   (Concio, in Friedrich's Docum. I. p. 200): 'Præterea singula verba in
   ista Christi ad Petrum allocutione de Petri successoribus intelligi
   nequeunt, quin aliquid maxime absurdi exinde sequi videretur. "Tu autem
   conversus," respiciunt certe conversionem Petri. Si priora verba;
   "orari pro te," et posteriora: "confirma fratres tuos," ad successores
   Petri coelestem vim, et munus transiisse probent, non videtur quarenam
   intermedia verba: "tu autem conversus," ad eos etiam pertinere, et
   aliquali sensu de eis intelligi, non debeant.'

   § 35. The Liturgical Standards of the Roman Church.

   Literature.

   Missale Romanum, ex decreto sacro-sancti Concilii Tridentini
   restitutum, S. Pii V., Pontificis Maximi, jussu editum, Clementis VIII.
   et Urbani VIII. auctoritate recognitum; in quo missæ novissimæ
   sanctorum accurate sunt dispositæ. (Innumerable editions.)

   Breviarium Romanum, ex decreto SS. Concilii Tridentini restitutum, S.
   Pii V., Pontificis Maximi, jussu editum, Clementis VIII. et Urbani
   VIII. auctoritate recognitum, cum Officiis Sanctorum novissime per
   Summos Pontifices usque ad hunc diem concessis. (The Paris and Lyons
   edition before me has over 1200 pp., with a Supplement of 127 pp. The
   Mechlin ed. of 1868 is in 4 vols.)

   Pontificale Romanum, Clementis VIII. ac Urbani VIII. jussu, editum,
   inde vero a Benedicto XIV. recognitum et castigatum. Cum Additionibus a
   Sacra Rituum Congregatione approbatis. (The Mechlin ed. of 1845 is in
   three parts, with all the rules and directions printed in red; hence
   the word Rubrics.)

   George Lewis: The Bible, the Missal, and the Breviary; or. Ritualism
   self-illustrated in the Liturgical Books of Rome. Edinburgh, 1863, 2
   vols.

   A secondary symbolical authority belongs to those Latin liturgical
   works of the Roman Church which have been sanctioned by the Pope for
   use in public and private worship. They contain, in the form of
   devotion, nearly all the articles of faith, especially those referring
   to the sacraments and the cultus of saints and of the holy Virgin, and
   are, in a practical point of view, even of greater importance than the
   doctrinal standards, inasmuch as they are interwoven with the daily
   religious life of the priests.

   Among these works the most important is the Missale Romanum, as issued
   by Pius V. in 1570, in compliance with a decree of the Council of
   Trent. It was subsequently revised again under Clement VIII. in 1604,
   and under Urban VIII. in 1634. The substance goes back to the early
   eucharistic services of the Latin Church, among which the principal
   ones are ascribed to Popes Leo I. (Sacramentarium Leonianum, probably
   from 483-492), Gelasius I. (Sacramentarium Gelasianum), and Gregory I.
   (Sacramentarium Gregorianum). But considerable diversity and confusion
   prevailed in provincial and local churches. Hence the Council of Trent
   ordered a new revision, under the direction of the Pope, with a view to
   secure uniformity. The Missal consists of three parts, besides
   Introduction and Appendix, viz.: (a) The Proprium Missarum de Tempore,
   or the services for the Sundays of the Christian year, beginning with
   the first Sunday in Advent, and closing with the last after
   Whitsuntide, all clustering around the great festivals of Christmas,
   Easter, and Pentecost. (b) The Proprium Missarum de Sanctis contains
   the forms for the celebration of mass on saints' days and other
   particular feasts, arranged according to the months and days of the
   civil year; the annually recurring death-days of saints being regarded
   as their celestial birth-days, (c) The Commune Sanctorum is
   supplementary to the second part, and devoted to the celebration of the
   days of those saints for whom there is no special service provided in
   the Proprium. The Appendix to the Missal contains various masses and
   benedictions.

   Next comes the Breviarum Romanum, revised by order of the Council of
   Trent, under Pius V., 1568, and again under Clement VIII., 1602, and
   finally brought into its present shape under Urban VIII., 1631. Since
   that time it has undergone no material changes, but received occasional
   additions of new festivals. The Breviary [360] contains the prayers,
   psalms, hymns, Scripture lessons, and patristic comments not only for
   every Sunday, but for every day of the ecclesiastical year, together
   with the legends of saints and martyrs, presenting model characters and
   model devotions for each day, some of them good and harmless, others
   questionable, superstitious, and childish. The Breviary is a complete
   thesaurus of Romish piety, the private liturgy of the Romish priest,
   and to all intents and purposes his Bible. It regulates his whole
   religious life. It is divided into four parts, according to the four
   seasons; each part has the same four sections: the Psalterium, the
   Proprium de Tempore, the Proprium Sanctorum, and the Commune Sanctorum.
   The Introduction contains the ecclesiastical calendar. The office of
   each day consists of the seven or eight canonical hours of devotion,
   which are brought into connection with the history of the passion.
   [361] The Breviary is the growth of many ages. In the early Church
   great liberty and diversity prevailed in the forms of devotion, but the
   Popes Leo I., Gelasius I., Gregory I., Gregory VII., Nicholas III., and
   others, labored to unify the priestly devotions, and this work was
   completed after the Council of Trent.

   Besides the Missale Romanum and the Breviarium Romanum, there is a
   Rituale Romanum, or Book of Priests' Rites; an Episcopale Romanum,
   containing the Episcopal ceremonies, and a Pontificale Romanum, or the
   Pontifical. They contain the offices for sacramental and other sacred
   acts and ceremonies, such as baptism, confirmation, ordination,
   matrimony, dedication of churches, altars, bells, etc., benediction of
   crosses, sacred vestures, cemeteries, etc.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [360] The term Breviary is derived from the abridgments of the
   Scriptures and lives of saints contained therein, as distinct from the
   plenarium officium; by others from the fact that later editions of the
   work are abridgments of former editions.

   [361] Matins, Lauds (3 A.M.), Prime (6 A.M.), Tierce (9 A.M.), Sext (12
   M.), Nones (3 P.M.), Vespers (6 P.M.), and Compline (midnight
   devotion). The Nocturn is a night service. The custom of saying prayers
   at these hours goes back to the third century, and partly to Jewish
   tradition. Tertullian (De jejun. c. 10) speaks of the tertia, sixta,
   and nona as apostolical hours of prayer. On the mystical reference to
   Christ's passion, comp. the old memorial verse:

   'Hæc sunt, septenis propter quæ psallimus horis

   Matutina ligat Christum, qui crimina purgat.

   Prima replet sputis. Dat causam tertia mortis.

   Sexta cruci nectit. Latus ejus nona bipertit.

   Vespera deponit. Tumulo completa [completorium] reponit.'

   III. By Roman Catholics.

   Besides many controversial writings since the year 1870 (quoted in part
   in §§ 31 and 34, and articles in Roman Catholic reviews (as the Dublin
   Review, the Civiltà Cattolica, the Catholic World) and newspapers (as
   the Paris L'Univers, the London Tablet, the Berlin Germania, etc.), see
   especially the Papal Encyclical of Nov. 21, 1873, in condemnation of
   the 'new heretics,' miscalled 'Old Catholics.'


   The Old Catholic movement--the most important in the Latin Church since
   the Reformation, with the exception, perhaps, of Jansenism--began
   during the Vatican Council, and was organized into a distinct Church
   three years afterwards (1873), at Constance, in the very hall where,
   three hundred and sixty years before, an oecumenical Council was held
   which, by deposing two rival Popes and electing another, asserted its
   superiority over the Papacy, but which, by burning John Huss for
   teaching evangelical doctrines, defeated its own professed object of a
   'Reformation of the Church in the head and the members.' This strange
   coincidence of history brings to mind Luther's poem on the Belgian
   martyrs:

   'Die Asche will nicht lassen ab,

   Sie stäubt in allen Landen;

   Hier hilft kein Loch, noch Grab, noch Grab,

   Sie macht den Feind zu Schanden.'

   The God of history has his horas et moras, but he always carries out
   his designs at last. The Old Catholic secession would have assumed far
   more formidable proportions, and cut off from the dominion of the Pope
   the most intelligent and influential dioceses, if the eighty-eight
   Bishops who in the Vatican Council voted against Papal Infallibility,
   had carried out their conviction, instead of making their submission
   for the sake of a hollow peace. But next to the Pope, Bishops, from an
   instinctive fear of losing power, have always been most hostile to any
   serious reform. The old story of the Jewish hierarchy, in dealing with
   Christ and the Apostles, is repeated again and again in the history of
   the Church, though also with the honorable exceptions of a Nicodemus
   and Gamaliel.

   OEcumenical Councils are very apt to give rise to secessions. A
   conscientious minority will not yield, in matters of faith, to a mere
   majority vote. Thus the Council of Nicæa (325) was only the signal for
   a new and more serious war between orthodoxy and the Arian heresy, and,
   even after the triumph of the former at Constantinople (381), the
   latter lingered for centuries among the newly converted German races.
   The Council of Ephesus (431) gave rise to the Nestorian schism, and the
   Council of Chalcedon (451) to the several Monophysite sects, which
   continue in the East to this day with almost as much tenacity of life
   as the orthodox Greek Church. From the sixth oecumenical Council (680)
   dates the Monothelite schism. The Council of Florence (1439) failed to
   effect a union between the Latin and the Greek communions. The Council
   of Trent (1563), instead of healing the split caused by the
   Reformation, only deepened and perpetuated it by consolidating Romanism
   and anathematizing evangelical doctrines. The nearest parallel to the
   case in hand is the schism of the Bishops and clergy of Utrecht, which
   originated in a protest against the implied Papal Infallibility of the
   anti-Jansenist bull Unigenitus, and which recently made common cause
   with the Old Catholics of Germany by giving them the Episcopal
   succession.

   The Old Catholic Church in Germany and Switzerland arose from a
   protest, in the name of conscience, reason, and honest learning,
   against the Papal absolutism and infallibilism of the Vatican Council,
   and against the obsolete mediævalism of the Papal Syllabus. It lifts
   its voice against unscrupulous Jesuitical falsifications of history,
   and against that spiritual despotism which requires, as the highest act
   of piety, the slaughter of the intellect and will, and thereby destroys
   the sense of personal responsibility. It has in its favor all the
   traditions of Gallicanism and liberal Catholicism, which place an
   oecumenical Council or the whole representative Church above the Pope,
   the testimony of the ancient Græco-Latin Church, which knew nothing of
   Papal Infallibility, and even condemned some Popes as heretics, and the
   current of history, which can not be turned backward.

   The leaders of the new Church are eminent for learning, ability, moral
   character, and position, and were esteemed, before the Vatican Council,
   pillars and ornaments of the Roman Church--viz., Döllinger, [362]
   Reinkens, [363] Friedrich, [364] Huber, [365] Michelis, [366] Reusch,
   [367] Langen, [368] von Schulte, [369] and ex-Père Hyacinthe Loyson.
   [370]

   The centres of Old Catholicism are Munich and Bonn in Germany, and
   Geneva and Soleure (also Olten) in Switzerland. Beyond these two
   countries it has many isolated sympathies, but no organized form, and
   no hold upon the people. [371] In September, 1873, the Old Catholics in
   the German Empire numbered about one hundred congregations (mostly in
   Prussia, Baden, and Bavaria), forty priests, and fifty thousand
   professed members. Since their more complete organization they will
   probably make more rapid progress. Heretofore the movement in Germany
   has been more scholastic than popular. It has enlisted the sympathies
   of the educated, but not to an equal extent the enthusiasm of the
   people. The question of Papal Infallibility has no such direct
   practical bearing as the question of personal salvation and peace of
   conscience, which made the Reformation spread with such irresistible
   power over all Western Christendom. The masses of Roman Catholics are
   either too ignorant or too indifferent to care much whether another
   dogma is added to the large number already adopted, and have no more
   difficulty to believe blindly in Papal Infallibility than in the daily
   miracle of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mass. [372] On
   the other hand, however, the Old Catholics are powerfully aided by the
   widespread indignation against priestcraft, and the serious conflict of
   the German Empire and the Swiss Republic with the Papacy, which was
   provoked by the Papal Syllabus and the Vatican Council, and may lead to
   a thorough revision of the ecclesiastical status of the Continent.
   Their ultimate success as a Church must chiefly depend upon the
   continued ascendency of the positive Christian element over the
   negative and radical (which raised and ruined the 'German Catholic' or
   Ronge movement of 1844); for only the enthusiasm of faith has
   constructive power, and that spirit of sacrifice and endurance which is
   necessary for the establishment of permanent institutions.

   The Old Catholic movement was foreshadowed in the liberal Catholic
   literature preceding the Vatican Council, especially Janus; it gathered
   strength during the Council; it uttered itself in a united protest
   against the decrees of the Council at a meeting of distinguished
   Catholic scholars at Nuremberg in August, 1870; and it came to an open
   rupture with Rome by the excommunication of Döllinger and his
   sympathizers.

   Being called upon by the Archbishop of Munich (his former pupil, and at
   first an anti-Infallibilist) to submit to the new dogma of Papal
   absolutism and Infallibility, Dr. Döllinger, in an open answer dated
   Munich, March 28,1871, declared that, as a Christian, as a theologian,
   as a historian, and as a citizen, he could not accept the Vatican
   decrees, for the reasons that they are inconsistent with the spirit of
   the Gospel and the clear teaching of Christ and the Apostles; that they
   contradict the whole genuine tradition of the Church; that the attempt
   to carry out the Papal absolutism had been in times past the cause of
   endless bloodshed, confusion, and corruption; and that a similar
   attempt now must lead to an irreconcilable conflict of the Church with
   the State, and of the clergy with the laity. [373] Whereupon Döllinger
   was excommunicated April 17, 1871, as being guilty of 'the crime of
   open and formal heresy.' [374]

   His colleague, Professor Friedrich, incurred the same fate. Other
   Bishops, forgetting their recent change of conviction, proceeded with
   the same rigor against refractory priests. Cardinal Rauscher suspended
   the Lent preacher Pederzani; Cardinal Schwarzenberg, Professor Pelleter
   (who afterwards became a Protestant); Bishop Förster (whose offer to
   resign was refused by the Pope) suspended Professors Reinkens, Baltzer,
   and Weber, of Breslau; the Bishop of Ermeland, Professors Michelis and
   Menzel, and Dr. Wollmann, in Braunsberg; the Archbishop of Cologne
   deposed the priest Dr. W. Tangermann, of Cologne, and suspended
   Professors Hilgers, Reusch, Langen, and Knoodt, of Bonn, who, however,
   supported by the Prussian Government, retained their official positions
   in the University.

   In spite of these summary proceedings of the Bishops, the Old Catholic
   party, aided by the sympathies of the educated classes, made steady
   progress, organizing congregations, holding annual meetings, and
   enlisting the secular and religions press. With great prudence the
   leaders avoided or postponed reforms, till they could be inaugurated
   and sanctioned by properly constituted authorities, and moved
   cautiously between a timid conservatism and a radical liberalism; thus
   retaining a hold on both wings of the nominal Catholic population.

   In the year 1873 the Old Catholics effected a regular Church
   organization, and secured a legal status in the German Empire, with the
   prospect of support from the national treasury. Professor Joseph Hubert
   Reinkens was elected Bishop by the clergy and the representatives of
   the laity, and was consecrated at Rotterdam by the Old Catholic Bishop
   Heykamp, of Deventer (Aug. 11, 1873). [375] He was recognized in his
   new dignity by the King of Prussia, and took the customary oath of
   allegiance at Berlin (Oct. 7). Other governments of Germany followed
   this example. (The Empire as such has nothing to do with the Church.)
   To complete the organization, the Congress at Constance adopted a
   synodical and parochial constitution, which makes full provision for an
   equal share of the laity with the clergy in the government of the
   Church; the synodical representation (Synodal-Repräsentanz), or
   executive committee, being composed of five laymen and five clergymen,
   including the Bishop. [376] This implies the Protestant principle of
   the general priesthood of believers, and will prevent hierarchical
   abuses. Certain changes in the cultus, such as the simplification of
   the mass as a memorial service of the atoning sacrifice of Christ, the
   substitution of the vernacular language for the Latin, the restoring of
   the cup to the laity, the introduction of more preaching, and the
   abolition of various abuses (including the forced celibacy of the
   clergy), will inevitably follow sooner or later.

   The doctrinal status of the Old Catholic denomination was at first
   simply Tridentine Romanism versus Vatican Romanism, or the Creed of
   Pius IV. against the Creed of Pius IX. [377] This is the ground taken
   by the Old Catholics in Holland, and adhered to by them to this day.
   But the logic of the protest against modern Popery will hardly allow
   the Old Catholics of Germany and Switzerland long to remain in this
   position. Their friendly attitude towards Protestants, as officially
   shown in their letter to the General Conference of the Evangelical
   Alliance, is inconsistent with the Tridentine anathemas. Tridentine
   Romanism, moreover, is as much an innovation on oecumenical Catholicism
   as the Vatican Romanism is an innovation on that of Trent, and both are
   innovations in the same line of consolidation of the one-sided
   principle of authority. There is no stopping at half-way stations. We
   must go back to the fountain-head, the Word of God, which is the only
   final and infallible authority in matters of faith, and furnishes the
   best corrective against all ecclesiastical abuses.

   The leaders of the Old Catholic Church are evidently on this road. They
   still adhere to Scripture and tradition, as the joint rule of faith:
   but they confine tradition to the unanimous consent of the ancient
   undivided Church, consequently to the oecumenical creeds, which are
   held in common by Greeks, Latins, and orthodox Protestants. They have
   been forced to give up their belief in the infallibility of an
   oecumenical Council, since the Vatican Council, which is as oecumenical
   (from the Roman point of view) as that of Trent, has sanctioned what
   they regard as fatal error. Moreover, Bishop Reinkens, in an eloquent
   speech before the Old Catholic Congress at Constance, disowned all
   Romish prohibitions of Bible reading, and earnestly encouraged the
   laity to read the Book of Life, that they may get into direct and
   intimate communion with God. [378] This communion with God through
   Christ as the only Mediator, and through his Word as the only rule of
   faith, is the very soul of evangelical Protestantism. The Scripture
   principle, consistently carried out, must gradually rule out the
   unscriptural doctrines and usages sanctioned by the Council of Trent.

   But it is not necessary on this account that the Old Catholics should
   ever become Protestants in the historical sense of the term. They may
   retain those elements of the Catholic system which are not inconsistent
   with the spirit of the Scriptures, though they may not be expressly
   sanctioned by the letter. They may occupy a peculiar position of
   mediation, and in this way contribute their share towards preparing the
   way for an ultimate reunion of Christendom. And this is their noble aim
   and desire, openly expressed in a fraternal letter to an assembly of
   evangelical Christians from nearly all Protestant denominations. They
   declare: 'We hope and strive for the restoration of the unity of the
   Christian Church. We frankly acknowledge that no branch of it has
   exclusively the truth. We hold fast to the ultimate view that upon the
   foundation of the Gospel, and the doctrines of the Church grounded upon
   it, and upon the foundation of the ancient, undivided Church, a union
   of all Christian confessions will be possible through a really
   oecumenical Council. This is our object and intention in the movement
   which has led us into close relations with the Evangelical, the
   Anglican, the Anglo-American, the Russian, and the Greek churches. We
   know that this goal can not easily be reached, but we see the primary
   evidences of success in the circumstance that a truly Christian
   intercourse has already taken place between ourselves and other
   Christian churches. Therefore we seize with joy the hand of fellowship
   you have extended to us, and beg you to enter into a more intimate
   fellowship with us in such a way as may be agreed upon by both
   parties.' [379]

   On the other hand, the Old Catholics have extended the hand of
   fellowship to the Greeks and Anglo-Catholics, and adopted, at a Union
   Conference held in Bonn, Sept., 1874, an agreement of fourteen theses,
   as a doctrinal basis of intercommunion between those Churches which
   recognize, besides the holy Scriptures, the binding authority of the
   tradition of the undivided Church of the first six centuries. In a
   second Conference, in 1875, they surrendered the doctrine of the double
   procession of the Spirit as a peace-offering to the Orientals. [380]

   In the mean time the Pope has cut off all prospect of reconciliation.
   In his Encyclical of November 21, 1873, addressed to all the
   dignitaries of the Roman Church, Pius IX., after unsparingly denouncing
   the governments of Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, for their cruel
   persecution of the Church, speaks at length of 'those new heretics,
   who, by a truly ridiculous abuse of the name, call themselves Old
   Catholics,' and launches at their 'pseudo-bishop' and all his abettors
   and helpers the sentence of excommunication, as follows:

   'The attempts and the aims of these unhappy sons of perdition appear
   plainly, both from other writings of theirs and most of all from that
   impious and most impudent of documents which has lately been published
   by him whom they have set up for themselves as their so-called bishop.
   For they deny and pervert the true authority of jurisdiction which is
   in the Roman Pontiff and the Bishops, the successors of the Blessed
   Peter and the Apostles, and transfer it to the populace, or, as they
   say, to the community; they stubbornly reject and assail the infallible
   teaching authority of the Roman Pontiff and of the whole Church; and,
   contrary to the Holy Spirit, who has been promised by Christ to abide
   in his Church forever, they audaciously affirm that the Roman Pontiff
   and the whole of the Bishops, priests, and people who are united with
   him in one faith and communion, have fallen into heresy by sanctioning
   and professing the definitions of the oecumenical Vatican Council.
   Therefore they deny even the indefectibility of the Church,
   blasphemously saying that it has perished throughout the world, and
   that its visible head and its Bishops have fallen away; and that for
   this reason it has been necessary for them to restore the lawful
   Episcopate in their pseudo-bishop, a man who, entering not by the gate,
   but coming up by another way, has drawn upon his head the condemnation
   of Christ.

   'Nevertheless, those unhappy men who would undermine the foundations of
   the Catholic religion, and destroy its character and endowments, who
   have invented such shameful and manifold errors, or, rather, have
   collected them together from the old store of heretics, are not ashamed
   to call themselves Catholics, and Old Catholics; while by their
   doctrine, their novelty, and their fewness they give up all mark of
   antiquity and of catholicity. . . .

   'But these men, going on more boldly in the way of iniquity and
   perdition, as by a just judgment of God it happens to heretical sects,
   have wished also to form to themselves a hierarchy, as we have said,
   and have chosen and set up for themselves as their pseudo-bishop a
   certain notorious apostate from the Catholic faith, Joseph Hubert
   Reinkens; and, that nothing might be wanting to their impudence, for
   his consecration they have had recourse to those Jansenists of Utrecht
   whom they themselves, before their falling away from the Church,
   regarded with other Catholics as heretics and schismatics. Nevertheless
   this Joseph Hubert Reinkens dares to call himself a bishop, and,
   incredible as it may seem, the most serene Emperor of Germany has by
   public decree named and acknowledged him as a Catholic bishop, and
   exhibited him to all his subjects as one who is to be regarded as a
   lawful bishop, and as such to be obeyed. But the very rudiments of
   Catholic teaching declare that no one can be held to be a lawful bishop
   who is not joined in communion of faith and charity to the rock on
   which the One Church of Christ is built; who does not adhere to the
   supreme pastor to whom all the sheep of Christ are committed to be fed;
   who is not united to the confirmer of the brotherhood which is in the
   world.' [This cuts off all Greek Bishops as well. Then follow the usual
   patristic texts for the pretensions of Rome.]

   'We therefore, who have been placed, undeserving as we are, in the
   Supreme See of Peter for the guardianship of the Catholic faith, and
   for the maintenance of the unity of the universal Church, according to
   the custom and, example of our predecessors and their holy decrees, by
   the power given us from on high, not only declare the election of the
   said Joseph Hubert Reinkens to be contrary to the holy canons,
   unlawful, and altogether null and void, and denounce and condemn his
   consecration as sacrilegious; but by the authority of Almighty God we
   declare the said Joseph Hubert--together with those who have taken part
   in his election and sacrilegious consecration, and whoever adhere to
   and follow the same, giving aid, favor, or consents--excommunicated
   under anathema, separated from the communion of the Church, and to be
   reckoned among those whose fellowship has been forbidden to the
   faithful by the Apostle, so that they are not so much as to say to
   them, God speed you!'

   As the Pope's letter of complaint to the Emperor of Germany (August,
   1873), in which he claims jurisdiction, in some sense, over all
   baptized Christians, called forth a courteous and pointed reply from
   the Emperor disclaiming all intention of persecuting the Catholic
   Church while defending the rights of the civil government against the
   encroachments of the hierarchy, and informing his Infallibility that
   Protestants recognize no other mediator between God and themselves than
   the Lord Jesus Christ; so this Encyclical was met by an able,
   dignified, and manly Pastoral from Bishop Reinkens, dated Bonn,
   December 14, 1873, in which, after refuting the accusations of the
   Pope, he closes with the following words: 'Brethren in the Lord, what
   shall we do when Pius IX. exhausts the language of reproach and
   calumny, and calls us even the most miserable sons of perdition
   (miserrimi isti perditionis filii), to embitter the uninquiring
   multitude against us? If we are true disciples of Jesus--as we
   trust--we have that peace which the Lord gives, and not the world, and
   our "heart will not be troubled, neither be afraid" (John xiv. 27). O
   how sweetly sounds the exhortation: "Bless them which persecute you:
   bless, and curse not;" "Recompense to no man evil for evil;" "If it be
   possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men" (Rom.
   xii. 14, 17, 18); "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
   good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
   you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father
   which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on
   the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matt. v. 44,
   45). Let us look up to Christ, our example, "who, when he was reviled,
   reviled not again" (1 Pet. ii. 21-23). "The peace of God, which passeth
   all understanding, keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ."'

   The Swiss Federal Government, in answer to the charges raised against
   it in the same Encyclical, has broken off all diplomatic intercourse
   with the Papal court. In a new Encyclical of March 23, 1875, addressed
   to the Bishops of Switzerland, Pious IX. confirmed the condemnation of
   Nov. 21, 1873, and hurled it with increased severity against the Old
   Catholics of that country, 'who attack the very foundations of the
   Catholic religion, boldly reject the dogmatic definitions of the
   Council of the Vatican, and by every means labor for the ruin of
   souls.' He calls upon the faithful to 'avoid their religious
   ceremonies, their instructions, their chairs of doctrinal pestilence,
   which they have the audacity to set up for the purpose of betraying the
   sacred doctrines, their writings, and contact with them. Let them have
   no part, no relation of any kind, with those intruding priests and the
   apostates who dare exercise the functions of the ecclesiastical
   ministry, and who have absolutely no jurisdiction and no legitimate
   mission at all. Let them hold them in horror as strangers and thieves,
   who come only to steal, assassinate, and destroy.'

   The Old Catholic movement in Switzerland is more radical and political
   than the German, and bears a similar relation to it as the Zwinglian
   Reformation does to the Lutheran. Edward Herzog, an able and worthy
   priest of Olten, was elected first bishop by the Swiss Synod, and
   consecrated by Bishop Reinkens at Rheinfelden, Sept. 18, 1876.

   from his intimate connection with members.

   [365] Professor of Philosophy at Munich, and author of works on the
   Philosophy of the Fathers, on Jesuitism, and against the last book of
   Strauss on The Old and New Faith.

   [366] Formerly professor at Braunsberg, and once Catholic member of the
   Prussian Chamber of Deputies, now pastor of the Old Catholic
   congregation at Zurich, an elderly gentleman of much learning and
   eloquence.

   [367] Professor of Theology in Bonn, editor of the literary organ of
   the Old Catholics, and Acting Secretary of Bishop Reinkens.

   [368] Likewise Professor of Theology in Bonn, and author of a learned
   work on the Vatican decrees examined in the light of Catholic tradition
   (1873).

   [369] The first canonist of Europe, the lay leader of Old Catholicism,
   and able president of its Congresses, formerly Professor of Canon Law
   in Prague, now in the University of Bonn. Before the Council he
   received many letters and tokens of respect from Pope Pius IX.

   [370] Born at Orleans, 1827, priest and monk of the order of the
   Carmelites, formerly esteemed the most eloquent preacher in France. He
   broke with his order and with Rome in 1869, and is now settled at
   Geneva as pastor of an Old Catholic congregation. His marriage to an
   American widow (1872) created almost as much sensation as Luther's
   marriage to a nun. He has recently withdrawn from state control, and
   established an independent Church (1874).

   [371] The German origin of the movement operates against it in France,
   which, with all its Gallican traditions, has, for political reasons,
   since the war of 1870, become more Romish than it ever was before. When
   Völk, at the Old Catholic Congress in Constance, alluded to the
   uprising of the Deutschthum versus the Welschthum, and the intrigues of
   French Jesuits, Hyacinthe and Pressensé left the hall. Yet the Old
   Catholic priests, who were elected pastors of Geneva by the Catholic
   part of the population in October, 1873--Loyson, Hurtault, and
   Charard--are all Frenchmen. Once more Geneva seems to become the centre
   and starting-point of a new reformation, which sooner or later will
   react upon France. Abbé Michaud, formerly of the Madeleine in Paris, so
   far is the only prominent Old Catholic in France. Among the Irish
   Catholics there is not the least indication of sympathy with Old
   Catholicism, not even in free America. Spain and Italy ought to
   sympathize with it, for the Pope is the implacable enemy of Italian
   unity and the Spanish republic; but they have kept aloof so far from
   any progressive religious movement; and Spain has once more surrendered
   herself to the rule of a Bourbon and the Pope (1875). In England, the
   famous pamphlet of Gladstone on the Vatican Decrees (1874) has brought
   to light the Old Catholic sympathies of Lord Acton and other prominent
   English Catholics.

   [372] When in Cologne, July, 1873, I asked a domestic of one of the
   first hotels where the Old Catholics worshiped. He promptly replied,
   'You mean the New Protestants. I have nothing to do with sects; I am a
   true Catholic, and mean to die one.' This seemed to me characteristic
   of the popular feeling in Cologne. The Dome was well filled with
   worshipers all Sunday, while the Old Catholics had a small though
   intelligent and respectable congregation in the Garrison Church, and in
   the small chapel at the City Hall. Dr. Tangermann read Latin mass like
   a Romish priest, but preached an evangelical sermon in German which
   would do credit to any Protestant pastor.

   [373] The following is the memorable protest of this aged divine, which
   reminds one of Luther's more bold and defiant refusal at Worms to
   recant his writings unless convicted of error from Scripture and
   reason: 'Als Christ, als Theologe, als Geschichtskundiger, als Bürger
   kann ich diese Lehre nicht annehmen. Nicht als Christ: denn sie ist
   unverträglich mit dem Geiste des Evangeliums and mit den klaren
   Aussprüchen Christi und der Apostel; sie will gerade das Imperium
   dieser Welt aufrichten, welches Christus ablehnte, will die Herrschaft
   über die Gemeinden, welche Petrus allen und sich selbst verbot. Nicht
   als Theologe: denn die gesammte echte Tradition der Kirche steht ihr
   unversöhnlich entgegen. Nicht als Geschichtskenner kann ich sie
   annehmen, denn als solcher weiss ich, dass das beharrliche Streben,
   diese Theorie der Weltherrschaft zu verwirklichen, Europa Ströme van
   Blut gekostet, ganze Länder vewirrt und heruntergebracht, den schönen
   organischen Verfassungsbau der älteren Kirche zerrüttet und die ärgsten
   Missbräuche in der Kirche erzeugt, genährt und festgehalten hat. Als
   Bürger endlich muss ich sie von mir weisen, well sie mit ihren
   Ansprüchen auf Unterwerfung der Staaten und Monarchen und der ganzen
   politischen Ordnung unter die päpstliche Gewalt und durch die eximirte
   Stellung, welche sie für den Klerus fordert, den Grund legt zu endloser
   verderblicher Zwietracht zwischen Staat und Kirche, zwischen
   Geistlichen und Laien. Denn das kann ich mir nicht verbergen, dass
   diese Lehre, an deren Folgen das alte deutsche Reich zu Grunde gegangen
   ist, falls sie bei dem katholischen Theil der deutschen Nation
   herrschend würde, sofort auch den Keim eines unheilbaren Siechthums in
   das eben erbaute neue 'Reich verpflanzen würde.'--J. von Döllinger's
   Erklärung an den Erzbishof von München-Freising, München, 1871, p. 17
   sq.

   [374] 'Crimen hæreseos externæ et formalis.'

   [375] In his Pastoral Letter, Bishop Reinkens disclaims all
   hierarchical ambition, vain show, and display, and promises to exercise
   his office in the spirit of apostolic simplicity as a pastor of the
   flock. He lays great stress on the primitive Catholic mode of his
   election by the clergy and the people, as contrasted with the modern
   election by the Pope. He claims to stand in the rank of Cyprian,
   Hilary, Ambrose, Augustine, and those thousands of Bishops who never
   were elected by the Pope, or were even known to the Pope, and yet are
   recognized as truly Catholic Bishops. Consecration by one Bishop is
   canonically valid, though two or more assistant Bishops are usually
   present. The late Archbishop Loos of Utrecht would have performed the
   act, had he not died a few months before. Rome, of course, considers
   this election and consecration by excommunicated priests as a mere
   farce and a damnable rebellion. See the Pope's Encyclical of Nov. 21,
   1872, quoted below.

   [376] See the Entwurf einer Synodal- und Gemeinde-Ordnung, Sect. III.
   §§ 13 and 14: 'In der Leitung des altkatholischen Gemeinwesens steht
   dem Bischof eine von der Synode gewählte Synodal-Repräsentanz zur
   Seite. Die Synodal-Repräsentanz besteht aus vier Geistlichen und fünf
   Laien.'

   [377] Their original programme, adopted at the first Congress at
   Munich, September 21, 1871, probably drawn up by Döllinger, was very
   conservative, and included the following articles:

   1. We hold fast to the Catholic faith as certified by Scriptures and
   tradition, and also to the Old Catholic worship. We reject from this
   stand-point the new dogmas enacted under the pontificate of Pius IX.,
   especially that regarding the infallibility and supreme ordinary and
   immediate jurisdiction of the Pope.

   2. We hold fast to the old constitution of the Church, and reject every
   attempt to deprive the Bishops of their diocesan independence. We
   acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, on the ground of the
   Fathers and Councils of the undivided Church of antiquity; but we deny
   the right of the Pope to define any article of faith, except in
   agreement with the holy Scriptures and the ancient and unanimous
   tradition of the Church.

   3. We aim at a reformation of various abuses of the Church, and a
   restoration of the rights of the laity in ecclesiastical affairs.

   4. We hope for a reunion with the Greek and Orthodox Russian Church,
   and for an ultimate fraternal understanding with the other Christian
   confessions, especially the Episcopal churches of England and America.

   [378] I give a few extracts from this address, which was delivered in
   the famous Council Hall of Constance, and received with great applause
   by the crowded assembly: 'The holy Scripture is the reflection of the
   sun of righteousness which appeared in Jesus Christ our Lord. I say,
   therefore, Read the holy Scriptures. I say more: For the Old Catholics
   who intrust themselves to my episcopal direction, there exists no
   prohibition of the reading of the Bible. . . . Let nothing hinder you
   from approaching the Gospel, that you may hear the voice of the
   Bridegroom (John iii. 29). Listen to his voice, and remember that, as
   the flower turns to the light, and never unfolds all its splendor and
   beauty except by constantly turning to the light of the sun, thus also
   the Christian's soul can not represent the full beauty and glory of its
   divine likeness except by constantly turning to this Gospel, in the
   rays of which its own fire is kindled. . . . Do not read the Scriptures
   from curiosity, to find things which are not to be revealed in this
   world; nor presumptuously, to brood over things which can not be
   explained by men; nor for the sake of controversy, to refute others;
   but read the Scriptures to enter into the most intimate communion with
   God, so that you may be able to say, Nothing shall separate me from the
   love of Christ. . . . It is not sufficient to have the Bible in every
   house, and to read it at certain hours in a formal and fragmentary
   manner, but it ought to be the light of the soul, to which it turns
   again and again. I repeat it once more: For the Old Catholics, no
   injunction exists against reading the Bible. On the contrary, I
   admonish you most earnestly: Read again and again in this holy book,
   sitting down in humility and joy at the feet of the Lord, for He alone
   has words of eternal life.'

FIFTH CHAPTER

  THE CREEDS OF THE EVANGELICAL CHURCHES.

   General Literature.

   There are no complete collections of Protestant Creeds, but several
   separate collections of the Lutheran and of the Reformed Creeds, which
   will be noticed below under the proper sections. The Corpus et
   Syntagma, Confessionum fidei, Genev. 1654, is chiefly Calvinistic, and
   the Oxford Sylloge Confessionum sub tempus reformandæ ecclesiæ
   editarum, 1827 (pp. 454), contains only six confessions (including the
   Prof. Fidei Trid. and the Confessio Saxonica).

   On the general history and principles of the Reformation, the reader is
   referred to the works, correspondence, and numerous biographies of the
   Reformers (e.g. the Corpus Reformatorum, ed. Bretschneider and
   Bindseil: Luther's Letters, by De Wette, supplemented by Seidemann:
   Calvin's Works, new edition by Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss; his Letters, by
   Bonnet; Herminjard's Correspondance des Réformateurs dans les pays de
   langue française; Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials, etc.; the
   publications of the Parker Society); and the historical works of
   Sleidan, Seckendorf, Salig, De Thou, Hottinger, Hess, Marheineke,
   Ranke, Merle D'aubigné, Hagenbach (fourth edition, 1870), Geo. P.
   Fisher; also Schaff (Principle of Protestantism, 1845), Dorner
   (Geschichte der Protest. Theologie, 1867, pp. 77-329, Engl. transl.
   Edinb. 1871, 2 vols.), Kahnis (Die Deutsche Reformation, Leipz. 1872).
   See lists of literature in Gieseler, Church History, Vol. IV. pp. 9
   sqq. (Anglo-Amer. edition), and Geo. P. Fisher (of Yale College), The
   Reformation, New York, 1873, Appendix II. pp. 567-591.

   § 37. The Reformation. Protestantism and Romanism.

   Protestant Christendom has a nominal membership of about one hundred
   millions, chiefly in the northern and western parts of Europe and
   America, and among the most vigorous and hopeful nations of the earth.
   It represents modern or progressive Christianity, while Romanism is
   mediæval Christianity in conflict with modern progress, and the Eastern
   Church ancient Christianity in repose.

   We must first of all distinguish between evangelical or orthodox
   Protestantism, which agrees with the Greek and Roman Church in
   accepting the holy Scriptures and the oecumenical faith in the Trinity
   and Incarnation, and heretical or radical Protestantism, which dissents
   from the oecumenical consensus, and makes a new departure either in a
   mystical or in a rationalistic direction. The former constitutes the
   great body of nominal Protestantism, and is the subject of this
   chapter. It includes, in the first line, the Lutheran and the Reformed
   Confessions, or the various national churches of the Reformation in
   Europe and their descendants in America; and then, in the second line,
   all those denominations which have proceeded or seceded from them,
   mostly on questions of government or minor points of doctrine, without
   departing from the essential articles of their faith, such as the
   Moravians, Methodists, Mennonites, Baptists, Quakers, Irvingites, and a
   number of free churches holding to the voluntary principle.

   The various Evangelical Protestant churches, viewed as distinct
   ecclesiastical organizations and creeds, take their rise directly or
   indirectly from the sixteenth century; but their principles are rooted
   and grounded in the New Testament, and have been advocated more or less
   clearly, in part or in full, by spiritual and liberal minded divines in
   every age of the Church. The stream of Latin or Western Christianity
   was divided in the sixteenth century; the main current moving
   cautiously and majestically in the old mediæval channel, the other
   boldly cutting several new beds for the overflowing waters, and rushing
   forward, at first with great rapidity and energy, then slacking its
   speed, and then resuming its forward march with the tide of emigration
   in a western direction, whither, in the prophetic language of the great
   English idealist, 'the course of empire takes its way.'

   The Reformation of the sixteenth century is, next to the introduction
   of Christianity, the greatest event in history. It was no sudden
   revolution; for what has no roots in the past can have no permanent
   effect upon the future. It was prepared by the deeper tendencies and
   aspirations of previous centuries, and, when finally matured, it burst
   forth almost simultaneously in all parts of Western Christendom. It was
   not a superficial amendment, not a mere restoration, but a
   regeneration; not a return to the Augustinian, or Nicene, or
   ante-Nicene age, but a vast progress beyond any previous age or
   condition of the Church since the death of St. John. It went, through
   the intervening ages of ecclesiasticism, back to the fountain-head of
   Christianity itself, as it came from the lips of the Son of God and his
   inspired Apostles. It was a deeper plunge into the meaning of the
   Gospel than even St. Augustine had made. It brought out from this
   fountain a new phase and type of Christianity, which had never as yet
   been fully understood and appreciated in the Church at large. It was,
   in fact, a new proclamation of the free Gospel of St. Paul, as laid
   down in the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians. It was a grand act of
   emancipation from the bondage of the mediæval hierarchy, and an
   assertion of that freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. It
   inaugurated the era of manhood and the general priesthood of believers.
   It taught the direct communion of the believing soul with Christ. It
   removed the obstructions of legalism, sacerdotalism, and ceremonialism,
   which, like the traditions of the Pharisees of old, had obscured the
   genuine Gospel and made void the Word of God. [381]

   We do not depreciate mediaeval Catholicism, the womb of the
   Reformation, the grandmother of modern civilization. It was an
   inestimable blessing in its time. When we speak of the 'dark ages,' we
   should never forget that the Church was the light in that darkness. She
   was the training-school of the Latin, Celtic, and Teutonic (partly also
   the Sclavonic) races in their childhood and wild youth. She gave them
   Christianity in the shape of a new theocracy, with a priesthood, minute
   laws, rites, and ceremonies. She acted as a bulwark against the
   despotism of the civil and military power, and she defended the moral
   interests, the ideal pursuits, and the rights of the people. But the
   discipline of law creates a desire which it can not satisfy, and points
   beyond itself, to independence and self-government: the law is a
   schoolmaster to lead men to the freedom of the Gospel. When the
   mediæval Church had fulfilled her great mission in Christianizing and
   civilizing (to a certain degree) the Western and Northern barbarians,
   the time was fulfilled, and Christianity could now enter upon the era
   of evangelical faith and freedom.

   And this is Protestantism. If it were a mere negation of popery, it
   would have vanished long since, leaving no wreck behind. It is
   constructive as well as destructive; it protests from the positive
   basis of the Gospel. It attacks human authority from respect for divine
   authority; it sets the Word of God over all the wisdom of men.

   The Reformation was eminently practical in its motive and aim. It
   started from a question of conscience: 'How shall a sinner be justified
   before God?' And this is only another form of the older and broader
   question: 'What shall I do to be saved?' The answer given by the
   Reformers (German, Swiss, French, English, and Scotch), with one
   accord, from deep spiritual struggle and experience, was: 'By faith in
   the all-sufficient merits of Christ, as exhibited in the holy
   Scriptures.' And by faith they understood not a mere intellectual
   assent to the truth, or a blind submission to the outward authority of
   the Church, but a free obedience, a motion of the will, a trust of the
   heart, a personal attachment and unconditional surrender of the whole
   soul to Christ, as the only Saviour from sin and death. The absolute
   supremacy and sufficiency of Christ and his Gospel in doctrine and
   life, in faith and practice, is the animating principle, the beating
   heart of the Reformation, and the essential unity of Protestantism to
   this day.

   Here lies its vitality and constructive power. From this central point
   the whole theology and Church life was directly or indirectly affected,
   and a new impulse given to the history of the world in every direction.

   The Reformers were baptized, confirmed, and educated, most of them also
   ordained, in the Catholic Church, and had at first no intention to
   leave it, but simply to purify it by the Word of God. They shrank from
   the idea of schism, and continued, like The Apostles, in the communion
   of their fathers until they were expelled from it. When the Pope
   refused to satisfy the reasonable demand for a reformation of abuses,
   and hurled his anathemas on the reformers, they were driven to the
   necessity of organizing new churches and setting forth new confessions
   of faith, but they were careful to maintain and express in them their
   consensus with the old Catholic faith as laid down in the Apostles'
   Creed.

   The doctrinal principle of evangelical Protestantism, as distinct from
   Romanism, is twofold--objective and subjective.

   The objective (generally called the formal} principle maintains the
   absolute sovereignty of the Bible, as the only infallible rule of the
   Christian faith and life, in opposition to the Roman doctrine of the
   Bible and tradition, as co-ordinate rules of faith. Tradition is not
   set aside altogether, but is subordinated, and its value made to depend
   upon the measure of its agreement with the Word of God.

   The subjective (commonly called the material) principle is the doctrine
   of justification by the free grace of God through a living faith in
   Christ, as the only and sufficient Saviour, in opposition to the Roman
   doctrine of (progressive) justification by faith and good works, as
   co-ordinate conditions of justification. Good works are held by
   Protestants to be necessary, not as means and conditions, but as
   results and evidences, of justification.

   To these two principles may be added, as a third, the social principle,
   which affects chiefly the government and discipline of the Church,
   namely, the universal priesthood of believers, in opposition to the
   exclusive priesthood of the clergy. Protestantism emancipates the laity
   from slavish dependence on the teaching and governing priesthood, and
   gives the people a proper share in all that concerns the interests and
   welfare of the Church; in accordance with the teaching of St. Peter,
   who applies the term clergy ( kleros, heritage, 1 Pet. v. 3) to the
   congregation, and calls all Christians 'living stones' in the spiritual
   house of God, to offer up 'spiritual sacrifices,' 'a chosen generation,
   a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,' setting forth
   'the praises of him who called them out of darkness into his marvelous
   light' (1 Pet. ii. 5, 9; comp. v. 1-4; Rev. i. 6; v. 10; xx. 6).

   It is impossible to reduce the fundamental difference between
   Protestantism and Romanism to a single formula without doing injustice
   to the one or the other. We should not forget that there are
   evangelical elements in Romanism, as there are legalistic and
   Romanizing tendencies in certain schools of Protestantism. But if we
   look at the prevailing character and the most prominent aspects of the
   two systems, we may draw the following contrasts:

   Protestantism corresponds to the Gentile type of Apostolic
   Christianity, as represented by Paul; Romanism, to the Jewish type, as
   represented by James and Peter, though not in Peter's Epistles (where
   he prophetically warns against the fruitful germ of the Papacy, viz.,
   hierarchical pride and assumption), but in his earlier stage and
   official position as the Apostle of circumcision. Paul was called
   afterwards, somewhat irregularly and outside of the visible succession,
   as the representative of a new and independent apostolate of the
   Gentiles. The temporary collision of Paul and Peter at Antioch (Gal.
   ii. 11) foreshadows and anticipates the subsequent antagonism between
   Protestantism and Catholicism.

   Protestantism is the religion of freedom (Gal. v. 1); Romanism, the
   religion of authority. The former is mainly subjective, and makes
   religion a personal concern; the latter is objective, and sinks the
   individual in the body of the Church. The Protestant believes on the
   ground of his own experience, the Romanist on the testimony of the
   Church (comp. John iv. 42).

   Protestantism is the religion of evangelism and spiritual simplicity;
   Romanism, the religion of legalism, asceticism, sacerdotalism, and
   ceremonialism. The one appeals to the intellect and conscience, the
   other to the senses and the imagination. The one is internal, the other
   external, and comes with outward observation.

   Protestantism is the Christianity of the Bible; Romanism, the
   Christianity of tradition. The one directs the people to the
   fountain-head of divine revelation, the other to the teaching
   priesthood. The former freely circulates the Bible, as a book for the
   people; the latter keeps it for the use of the clergy, and overrules it
   by its traditions.

   Protestantism is the religion of immediate communion of the soul with
   Christ through personal faith; Romanism is the religion of mediate
   communion through the Church, and obstructs the intercourse of the
   believer with his Saviour by interposing an army of subordinate
   mediators and advocates. The Protestant prays directly to Christ; the
   Romanist usually approaches him only through the intercession of the
   blessed Virgin and the saints.

   Protestantism puts Christ before the Church, and makes Christliness the
   standard of sound churchliness; Romanism virtually puts the Church
   before Christ, and makes churchliness the condition and measure of
   piety. [382]

   Protestantism claims to be only one, but the most advanced portion of
   the Church of Christ; Romanism identifies itself with the whole
   Catholic Church, and the Church with Christianity itself. The former
   claims to be the safest, the latter the only way to salvation.

   Protestantism is the Church of the Christian people; Romanism is the
   Church of priests, and separates them by education, celibacy, and even
   by their dress as widely as possible from the laity.

   Protestantism is the Christianity of personal conviction and inward
   experience; Romanism, the Christianity of outward institutions and
   sacramental observances, and obedience to authority. The one starts
   from Paul's, the other from James's doctrine of justification. The one
   lays the main stress on living faith, as the principle of a holy life;
   the other on good works, as the evidence of faith and the condition of
   justification.

   Protestantism proceeds from the invisible Church to the visible; Rome,
   vice versa, from the visible to the invisible. [383]

   Protestantism is progressive and independent; Romanism, conservative
   and traditional. The one is centrifugal, the other centripetal. The one
   is exposed to the danger of radicalism and endless division; the other
   to the opposite danger of stagnation and mechanical and tyrannical
   uniformity.

   The exclusiveness and anti-Christian pretensions of the Papacy,
   especially since it claims infallibility for its visible head, make it
   impossible for any Church to live with it on terms of equality and
   sincere friendship. And yet we should never forget the difference
   between Popery and Catholicism, nor between the system and its
   followers. It becomes Protestantism, as the higher form of
   Christianity, to be liberal and tolerant even towards intolerant
   Romanism.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [381] It is significant that Christ uses paradosis, tradition, only in
   an unfavorable sense, as opposed to the Word of God, viz., Matt. xv. 3,
   6; Mark vii. 5, 8, 9, 13. Paul employs the term in a bad sense, Gal. i.
   14 and Col. ii. 8: in a good sense, of the doctrines of the Gospel, 1
   Cor. xi. 2; 2 Thess. ii. 15; iii. 6.

   [382] This is no doubt the meaning of Schleiermacher's famous formula
   (Der Christliche Glaube, Vol. I. § 24): 'Protestantism makes the
   relation of the individual to the Church dependent on his relation to
   Christ; Catholicism, vice versa, makes the relation of the individual
   to Christ dependent on his relation to the Church.' His pupil and
   successor, Dr. Twesten, puts the distinction in this way: 'Catholicism
   emphasizes the first, Protestantism the second, clause of the passage
   of Irenæus: "Where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where
   the Spirit of God is, there is the Church and all grace."'

   [383] This is the distinction made by Möhler, who thereby
   inconsistently admits the essential truth of the Protestant distinction
   between the visible and invisible Church, which Bellarmin denies as an
   empty abstraction.

   § 38. The Evangelical Confessions of Faith.

   The Evangelical Confessions of faith date mostly from the sixteenth
   century (1530 to 1577), the productive period of Protestantism, and are
   nearly contemporaneous with the Tridentine standards of the Church of
   Rome. They are the work of an intensely theological and polemical age,
   when religious controversy absorbed the attention of all classes of
   society. They embody the results of the great conflict with the Papacy.
   A smaller class of Confessions (as the Articles of Dort and the
   Westminster Standards) belongs to the seventeenth century, and grew out
   of internal controversies among Protestants themselves. The eighteenth
   century witnessed a powerful revival of practical religion and
   missionary zeal through the labors of the Pietists and Moravians in
   Germany, and the Methodists in England and North America, but, in its
   ruling genius, it was irreligious and revolutionary, and undermined the
   authority of all creeds. In the nineteenth century a new interest in
   the old creeds was awakened, and several attempts were made to reduce
   the lengthy confessions to brief popular summaries, or to formularize
   the doctrinal consensus of the different evangelical denominations. The
   present tendency among Protestants is to diminish rather than to
   increase the number of articles of faith, and to follow in any new
   formula the simplicity of the Apostles' Creed; while Romanism pursues
   the opposite course.

   The symbols of the Reformation are very numerous, but several of them
   were merely provisional, and subsequently superseded by maturer
   statements of doctrine. Some far exceed the proper limits of a creed,
   and are complete systems of theology for the use of the clergy. It was
   a sad mistake and a source of incalculable mischief to incorporate the
   results of every doctrinal controversy with the confession of faith,
   and to bind lengthy discussions, with all their metaphysical
   distinctions and subtleties, upon the conscience of every minister and
   teacher. There is a vast difference between theological opinions and
   articles of faith. The development of theology as a science must go on,
   and will go on in spite of all these shackles.

   As to the theology of the confessions of orthodox Protestantism, we may
   distinguish in them three elements, the oecumenical, the Augustinian,
   and the evangelical proper.

   1. The oecumenical element. In theology and Christology the Protestant
   symbols agree with the Greek and Roman Churches, and also in the other
   articles of the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds from the creation of the
   world to the resurrection of the body.

   2. The Augustinian element is found in anthropology, or the doctrines
   of sin and grace, predestination, and perseverance. Here the Protestant
   confessions agree with the system of Augustine, who had more influence
   upon the reformers than any uninspired teacher. The Latin Church during
   the Middle Ages had gradually fallen into Pelagian and semi-Pelagian
   doctrines and practices, although these had been condemned in the fifth
   century. The Calvinistic confessions, however, differ from the Lutheran
   in the logical conclusions derived from the Augustinian premises, which
   they hold in common.

   3. The Evangelical Protestant and strictly original element is found in
   soteriology, and in all that pertains to subjective Christianity, or
   the personal appropriation of salvation. Here belong the doctrines of
   the rule of faith, of justification by faith, of the nature and office
   of faith and good works, of the assurance of salvation; here also the
   protest against all those doctrines of Romanism which are deemed
   inconsistent with the Scripture principle and with justification by
   faith. The papacy, the sacrifice of the mass, transubstantiation,
   purgatory, indulgences, meritorious and hypermeritorious works, the
   worship of saints, images, and relics are rejected altogether, while
   the doctrine of the Church and the Sacraments was essentially modified.

   Catholicism assumed from the beginning, and retains to this day, two
   distinct and antagonistic types, the Greek and the Roman, which
   represent a Christian transformation of the antecedent and underlying
   nationalities of speculative Greece and world-conquering Rome. In like
   manner, but to a much larger extent (as may be expected from the
   greater liberty allowed to national and individual rights and
   peculiarities), is Protestantism divided since the middle of the
   sixteenth century into the Lutheran and the Reformed Confessions. To
   the former belong the established churches in most of the German
   States, in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and all others which call
   themselves after Luther; the Reformed--in the historical arid
   Continental sense of the term [384] --embraces the national evangelical
   churches of Switzerland, France, Holland, some parts of Germany,
   England, Scotland, with their descendants in America and the British
   colonies.

   The designation Reformed is insufficient to cover all the denominations
   and sects which have sprung directly or indirectly from this family
   since the Reformation, especially in England during the conflict of the
   Established Church with Puritanism and nonconformity; and hence in
   English and American usage it has given way to sectional and specific
   titles, such as Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists,
   Baptists, Wesleyans or Methodists, etc. The term Calvinism designates
   not a church, but a theological school in the Reformed Church, which in
   some sections allows also Arminian views. Puritanism, likewise, is not
   a term for a distinct ecclesiastical organization, but for a tendency
   and party which exerted a powerful influence in the Anglican and other
   Reformed Churches on questions of doctrine, government, discipline, and
   worship.

   Among the original Reformed Churches the Anglican stands out in many
   respects distinctly as a third type of Protestantism: it is the most
   powerful and the most conservative of all the national or established
   churches of the Reformation, and retains the entire basis of the
   mediæval hierarchy, without the papacy; it is a compromise between
   Catholicism and Protestantism, cemented by the royal supremacy, and
   leaves room, for Romanizing high-churchism and Puritanic low-churchism,
   as well as for intervening broad-churchism. But its original doctrinal
   status was moderately Calvinistic, and for a time it made even common
   cause with the ultra-Calvinistic Synod of Dort.

   The doctrinal difference between Lutheranism and Reform was originally
   confined to two articles, namely, the nature of Christ's presence in
   the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the extent of God's sovereignty in
   the ante-historic and premundane act of predestination. At the
   Conference held in Marburg, Luther and Zwingli agreed in fourteen and a
   half articles, and differed only in the other half of the fifteenth
   article, concerning the real presence. [385] The Swiss reformer saw in
   this difference no obstacle to fraternal fellowship with the
   Wittenbergers, with whom, he said, he would rather agree than with any
   people on earth, and, with tears in his eyes, he extended his hand to
   Luther; but the great man, otherwise so generous and liberal, who had
   himself departed from the Catholic Church in much more essential
   points, felt compelled in his conscience to withhold his hand on
   account of a general difference of 'spirit,' [386] which revealed
   itself in subsequent controversies, and defeated many attempts at
   reunion.

   The internal quarrels among Christian brethren, which are found more or
   less in all denominations and ages, [387] are the most humiliating and
   heart-sickening chapters in Church history, but they are overruled by
   Providence for the fuller development of theology, a wider spread of
   Christianity, and a deeper divine harmony, which will ultimately, in
   God's own good time, spring out of human discord.

   The two great families of Protestantism are united in all essential
   articles of faith, and their members may and ought to cultivate
   intimate Christian fellowship without sacrifice of principle or loyalty
   to their communion. Yet they are distinct ecclesiastical
   individualities, and Providence has assigned them peculiar fields of
   labor. Their differences in theology, government, worship, and mode of
   piety are rooted in diversities of nationality, psychological
   constitution, education, external circumstances, and gifts of the
   Spirit.

   1. The Lutheran Church arose in monarchical Germany, and bears the
   impress of the German race, of which Luther was the purest and
   strongest type. The Reformed Church began, almost simultaneously, in
   republican Switzerland, and spread in France, Holland, England, and
   Scotland. The former extended, indeed, to kindred Scandinavia, and, by
   emigration, to more distant countries. But outside of Germany it is
   stunted in its normal growth, or undergoes, with the change of language
   and nationality, an ecclesiastical transformation. [388] The Reformed
   Church, on the other hand, while it originated in the German cantons of
   Switzerland, and found a home in several important parts of Germany, as
   the Palatinate, the Lower Rhine, and (through the influence of the
   House of Hohenzollern since the Elector Sigismund, 1614) in Brandenburg
   and other provinces of Prussia, was yet far more fully and vigorously
   developed among the maritime and freer nations, especially the
   Anglo-Saxon race, and follows its onward march to the West and the
   missionary fields of the East. The modern Protestant movements among
   the Latin races in the South of Europe likewise mostly assume the
   Reformed, some even a strictly Calvinistic type. Converts from the
   excessive ritualism of Rome are apt to swing to the opposite extreme of
   Puritan simplicity.

   Germany occupies the front rank in sacred learning and scientific
   theology, but the future of evangelical Protestantism is mainly
   intrusted to the Anglo-American churches, which far surpass all others
   in wealth, energy, liberality, philanthropy, and a firm hold upon the
   heart of the two great nations they represent.

   2. The Lutheran Church, as its name indicates, was rounded and shaped
   by the mighty genius of Luther, who gave to the Germans a truly
   vernacular Bible, Catechism, and hymn-book, and who thus meets them at
   every step in their public and private devotions. We should, indeed,
   not forget the gentle, conciliatory, and peaceful genius of
   Melanchthon, which never died out in the Lutheran Confession, and forms
   the connecting link between it and the Reformed. He represents the very
   spirit of evangelical union, and practiced it in his intimate
   friendship with the stern and uncompromising Calvin, who in turn
   touchingly alludes to the memory of his friend. But the influence of
   the 'Præceptor Germaniæ' was more scholastic and theological than
   practical and popular. Luther was the originating, commanding reformer,
   'born,' as he himself says, 'to tear up the stumps and dead roots, to
   cut away the thorns, and to act as a rough forester and pioneer;' while
   'Melanchthon moved gently and calmly along, with his rich gifts from
   God's own hand, building and planting, sowing and watering.' Luther
   was, as Melanchthon called him, the Protestant Elijah. He spoke almost
   with the inspiration and authority of a prophet and apostle, and his
   word shook the Church and the Empire to the base. He can be to no
   nation what he is to the German, as little as Washington can be to any
   nation what he is to the American. [389] And yet, strange to say, with
   all the overpowering influence of Luther, his personal views on the
   canon [390] and on predestination [391] were never accepted by his
   followers; and if we judge him by the standard of the Form of Concord,
   he is a heretic in his own communion as much as St. Augustine, on
   account of his doctrines of sin and grace, is a heretic in the Roman
   Church, revered though he is as the greatest among the Fathers.

   The Reformed Church had a large number of leaders, as Zwingli,
   OEcolampadius, Bullinger, Calvin, Beza, Cranmer, Knox, but not one of
   them, not even Calvin, could impress his name or his theological system
   upon her. She is independent of men, and allows full freedom for
   national and sectional modifications and adaptations of the principles
   of the Reformation.

   3. The Lutheran Confession starts from the wants of sinful man and the
   personal experience of justification by faith alone, and finds, in this
   'article of the standing and falling Church,' comfort and peace of
   conscience, and the strongest stimulus to a godly life. The Reformed
   Churches (especially the Calvinistic sections) start from the absolute
   sovereignty of God and the supreme authority of his holy Word, and
   endeavor to reconstruct the whole Church on this basis. The one
   proceeds from anthropology to theology; the other, from theology to
   anthropology. The one puts the subjective or material principle of the
   Reformation first, the objective or formal next; the other reverses the
   order; yet both maintain, in inseparable unity, the subjective and
   objective principles of the Reformation.

   The Augsburg Confession, which is the first and the most important
   Lutheran symbol, does not mention the Bible principle at all, although
   it is based upon it throughout; [392] the Articles of Smalcald mention
   it incidentally; [393] and the Form of Concord more formally. [394] But
   the Reformed Confessions have a separate article de Scriptura Sacra, as
   the only rule of faith and discipline, and put it at the head,
   sometimes with a full list of the canonical books. [395]

   4. The Lutheran Church has an idealistic and contemplative, the
   Reformed Church a realistic and practical, spirit and tendency. The
   former aims to harmonize Church and State, theology and philosophy,
   worship and art; the latter draws a sharper line of distinction between
   the Word of God and the traditions of men, the Church and the world,
   the Church of communicants and the congregation of hearers, the
   regenerate and the unregenerate, the divine and the human. The one is
   exposed to the danger of pantheism, which shuts God up within the
   world; the other to the opposite extreme of deism, which abstractly
   separates him from the world. Hence the leaning of the Lutheran
   Christology to Eutychianism, the leaning of the Reformed to
   Nestorianism.

   The most characteristic exponent of this difference between the two
   confessions is found in their antagonistic doctrines of the Lord's
   Supper; and hence their controversies clustered around this article, as
   the Nicene and post-Nicene controversies clustered around the person of
   Christ. Luther teaches the real presence of Christ's body and blood in,
   with, and under the elements, the oral manducation by unworthy as well
   as worthy communicants, and the ubiquity of Christ's body; while
   Zwingli and Calvin, carefully distinguishing the sacramental sign from
   the sacramental grace, teach--the one only a symbolical, the other a
   spiritual real, presence and fruition for believers alone. The Romish
   doctrine of transubstantiation is equally characteristic of the magical
   supernaturalism and asceticism of Romanism, which realizes the divine
   only by a miraculous annihilation of the natural elements. Lutheranism
   sees the supernatural in the natural, Calvinism above the natural,
   Romanism without the natural.

   5. Viewed in their relations to the mediæval Church, Lutheranism is
   more conservative and historical, the Reformed Church more progressive
   and radical, and departs much further from the traditionalism,
   sacerdotalism, and ceremonialism of Rome. The former proceeded on the
   principle to retain what was not forbidden by the Bible; the latter, on
   the principle to abolish what was not commanded.

   The Anglican Church, however, though moderately Calvinistic in her
   Thirty-nine Articles, especially in the doctrine on the Scriptures and
   the Sacraments, makes an exception from the other Reformed communions,
   since it retained the body of the episcopal hierarchy and the Catholic
   worship, though purged of popery. Hence Lutherans like to call it a
   'Lutheranizing Church;' but the conservatism of the Church of England
   was of native growth, and owing to the controlling influence of the
   English monarchs and bishops in the Reformation period.

   6. The Lutheran Confession, moreover, attacked mainly the Judaism of
   Rome, the Reformed Church its heathenism. 'Away with legal bondage and
   work righteousness!' was the war-cry of Luther; 'Away with idolatry and
   moral corruption!' was the motto of Zwingli, Farel, Calvin, and Knox.

   7. Luther and Melanchthon were chiefly bent upon the purification of
   doctrine, and established State churches controlled by princes,
   theologians, and pastors. Calvin and Knox carried the reform into the
   sphere of government, discipline, and worship, and labored to found a
   pure and free church of believers. Lutheran congregations in the old
   world are almost passive, and most of them enjoy not even the right of
   electing their pastor; while well-organized Reformed congregations have
   elders and deacons chosen from the people, and a much larger amount of
   lay agency, especially in the Sunday-school work. Luther first
   proclaimed the principle of the general priesthood, but in practice it
   was confined to the civil rulers, and carried out in a wrong way by
   making them the supreme bishops of the Church, and reducing the Church
   to a degrading dependence on the State.

   8. Luther and his followers carefully abstained from politics, and
   intrusted the secular princes friendly to the Reformation with the
   episcopal rights; Calvin and Knox upheld the sole headship of Christ,
   and endeavored to renovate the civil state on a theocratic basis. This
   led to serious conflicts and wars, but they resulted in a great advance
   of civil and religious liberty in Holland, England, and the United
   States. The essence of Calvinism is the sense of the absolute
   sovereignty of God and the absolute dependence of man; and this is the
   best school of moral self-government, which is true freedom. Those who
   feel most their dependence on God are most independent of men. [396]

   9. The strength and beauty of the Lutheran Church lies in its profound
   theology, rich hymnology, simple, childlike, trustful piety; the
   strength and beauty of the Reformed Churches, in aggressive energy and
   enterprise, power of self-government, strict discipline, missionary
   zeal, liberal sacrifice, and faithful devotion, even to martyrdom, for
   the same divine Lord. From the former have proceeded Pietism and
   Moravianism, a minutely developed scholastic orthodoxy, speculative
   systems and critical researches in all departments of sacred learning,
   but also antinomian tendencies, and various forms of mysticism,
   rationalism, and hypercriticism. The latter has produced Puritanism,
   Congregationalism, Methodism, Evangelicalism (in the Church of
   England), the largest Bible, tract, and missionary societies, has built
   most churches and benevolent institutions, but is ever in danger of
   multiplying sectarian divisions, overruling the principle of authority
   by private judgment, and disregarding the lessons of history.

   10. Both churches have accomplished, and are still accomplishing, a
   great and noble work. Let them wish each other God's speed, and
   stimulate each other to greater zeal. A noble rivalry is far better
   than sectarian envy and jealousy. There have been in both churches, at
   all times, men of love and peace as well as men of war, with
   corresponding efforts to unite Lutheran and Reformed Christians, from
   the days of Melanchthon and Bucer, Calixtus and Baxter, down to the
   Prussian Evangelical Union, the German Church Diet, and the Evangelical
   Alliance. Even the exclusive Church of England has entered into a sort
   of alliance with the Evangelical Church of Prussia in jointly founding
   and maintaining the Bishopric of St. James in Jerusalem. [397]

   The time for ecclesiastical amalgamation, or organic union, has not yet
   come, but Christian recognition and union in essentials is quite
   consistent with denominational distinctions in non-essentials, and
   should be cultivated by all who love our common Lord and Saviour, and
   desire the triumph of his kingdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [384] As used in all Continental works on Church history and symbolics.
   It means originally the Catholic Church reformed of abuses, or
   regenerated by the Word of God.

   [385] The fifteenth and last of the Marburg articles treats of the
   Lord's Supper, and after stating the points of agreement, concludes
   thus: 'And although at present we can not agree whether the true body
   and the true blood of Christ be corporeally present in the bread and
   wine (ob der wahre Leib und das wahre Blut Christi leiblich im Brode
   und Weine gegenwärtig sei), yet each party is to show to the other
   Christian love, as far as conscience permits (so weit es das Gewissen
   jedem gestattet), and both parties should fervently pray to Almighty
   God that by his Spirit he may strengthen us in the true understanding.
   Amen.'

   [386] ' Ihr habt einen andern Geist, ' said Luther to Zwingli.

   [387] The feuds between monastic orders and theological schools in the
   Roman and Greek Churches, and the quarrels even in the oecumenical
   Councils, from the Nicene down to the Vatican, are fully equal in
   violence and bitterness to the Protestant controversies in the
   sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and are less excusable on account
   of the boasted doctrinal unity of those churches.

   [388] This is the case with the great majority of Anglicized and
   Americanized Lutherans, who adopt Reformed views on the Sacraments, the
   observance of Sunday, Church discipline, and other points.

   [389] Luther can only be fully understood by a German, while a
   Frenchman or an Englishman (with some exceptions, as Coleridge, Hare,
   Carlyle) is likely to be repelled by some of his writings, e.g., his
   coarse book against Henry VIII. Hence the unfavorable judgments of such
   scholars as Hallam, Sir William Hamilton, Pusey; while, on the other
   hand, even liberal Catholics among German scholars can not but admire
   him as Germans. Dr. Döllinger, long before his secession from Rome,
   said (in his book Kirche und Kirchen): 'Luther ist der gewaltigste
   Volksmann, der populärste Charakter, den Deutschland je besessen. In
   dem Geiste dieses Mannes, des grössten unter den Deutschen seines
   Zeitalters, ist die protestantische Doctrin entsprungen. Vor der
   Ueberlegenheit und schöpferischen Energie dieses Geistes bog damals der
   aufstrebende, thatkräftige Theil der Nation demuthsvoll und gläubig die
   Kniee.' The towering greatness of Luther is to the Lutherans a constant
   temptation to hero-worship, as Napoleon's brilliant military genius is
   a misfortune and temptation to France. Lessing expressed his
   satisfaction at the discovery of some defects in Luther's character,
   since he was, as he says, 'in imminent danger of making him an object
   of idolatrous veneration. The proofs that in some things he was like
   other men are to me as precious as the most dazzling of his virtues.'
   There are not a few Lutherans who have more liking for Luther's faults
   than for his virtues, and admire his conduct at Marburg as much, if not
   more, than his conduct at Worms. A very respectable Lutheran professor
   of theology resolved the difference between Luther and Calvin into
   this: that the one was human, the other inhuman! Calvin once nobly
   said, 'Though Luther should call me a devil, I would still revere and
   love him as an eminent servant of God.' If he was cruel, according to
   our modern notions, in his treatment of Servetus, he acted in the
   spirit of his age, and was approved even by the gentle Melanchthon. His
   followers need fear no comparison with any other Christians as to
   humanity and liberality.

   [390] He irreverently called the Epistle of St. James an 'epistle of
   straw,' and had objections to the Epistle to the Hebrews, the
   Apocalypse, and the Book of Esther. He was as thoroughly convinced of
   the inspiration and authority of the Word of God as the most orthodox
   divine can be, but he had free views on the mode of inspiration and the
   extent of the traditional canon.

   [391] Luther, in his work De servo arbitrio, against Erasmus, written
   in 1525, teaches the slavery of the human will, the dualism in the
   divine will (secret and revealed), and unconditional predestination to
   salvation and damnation, in language stronger than even Calvin ever
   used, who liked the views of that book, but objected to some of its
   hyperbolical expressions (Opera, Tom. VII. p. 142). Melanchthon, who
   originally held the same Augustinian theory (like all the Reformers),
   gradually changed it (openly since 1535) in favor of a synergistic
   theory. But Luther never recalled his tract against Erasmus; on the
   contrary, he counted it among his best, and among the few of his books
   which he would not be willing 'to swallow, like Saturn his own
   children.' He never made this a point of difference from the Swiss. In
   the Articles of Smalcald, 1537 (III. i. p. 318, ed. Hase), he again
   denied the freedom of the will, as a scholastic error; and in his
   commentary on Genesis (Ch. vi. 6, 18; xxvi), one of his last works, he
   taught the same view of the secret will of God as in 1525. Comp. J.
   Müller: Lutheri de prædestinatione et libero arbitrio doctrina, 1832,
   and his Dogmat. Abhandlungen, 1870, pp. 187sqq.; Lütkens: Luther's
   Prædestinationslehre im Zusammenhang mit seiner Lehre vom freien
   Willen, 1858; Köstlin: Luther's Theologie in ihrer geschichtl.

   Centraldogmen, 1854, Vol. I. pp. 57 sqq.; Dorner: Geschichte der
   protest. Theologie, 1867, Vol. I. pp. 194 sqq.

   [392] The Preface of the Augsburg Confession declares that the
   Confession is 'drawn from the holy Scriptures and the pure Word of
   God.'

   [393] Part II. (p. 309): 'The Word of God, and no one else, not even an
   angel, can establish articles of faith.' ('Regulam aliam habemus, ut
   videlicet Verbum Dei condat articulos fidei, et præterea nemo, ne
   angelus quidem.')

   [394] Form. Conc., Part I. or Epit., at the beginning: 'We believe,
   teach, and confess that the only rule and standard (unicam regulam et
   normam), according to which all doctrines and teachers alike ought to
   be tried and judged, are the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the
   Old and New Testaments alone.' Comp. Preface to the Second Part.

   [395] Conf. Helv. II. ch. i. (De Scriptura sancta, vero Dei verbo): '
   Credimus et confitemur Scripturas canonicas sanctorum Prophetarum et
   Apostolorum utriusque Testamenti, ipsum verum esse Verbum Dei: et
   auctoritatem sufficientem ex semetipsis, non ex hominibus habere. '
   Conf. Helv. I. (Basil. II.) art. 1; Conf. Gall. art. 2-5; Conf. Scot.
   art. 18, 19; Conf. Belg. art. 2-7; art. Angl. art. 6 (Scriptura sacra
   continet omnia quæ ad salutem sunt necessaria, etc., with a list of the
   canonical books, from which the Apocrypha are carefully distinguished);
   Westminster Conf. of Faith, ch. i. (more fully), etc. The exception of
   the first Confession of Basle is only apparent, for it concludes with a
   submission of all its articles to the supreme authority of the
   Scriptures (Postremo, hanc nostrum confessionem judicio sacræ biblicæ
   Scripturæ subjicimus; eoque pollicemur, si ex prædictis Scripturis in
   melioribus instituamur, nos ommi tempore Deo et sacrosancto ipsius
   Verbo maxima cum gratiarum actione obsecuturos esse').

   [396] The principles of the Republic of the United States can be
   traced, through the intervening link of Puritanism, to Calvinism,
   which, with all its theological rigor, has been the chief educator of
   manly characters and promoter of constitutional freedom in modern
   times. The inalienable rights of an American citizen are nothing but
   the Protestant idea of the general priesthood of believers applied to
   the civil sphere, or developed into the corresponding idea of the
   general kingship of free men.

   [397] Chiefly the work of Chevalier Bunsen and his congenial friend,
   Frederick William IV.

   The Evangelical Lutheran Church, in whole or in part, acknowledges nine
   symbolical books: three of them are inherited from the Catholic Church,
   viz., the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed (with the Filioque), and
   the Athanasian Creed; six are original, viz., the Augsburg Confession,
   drawn up by Melanchthon (1530), the Apology of the Confession, by the
   same (1530), the Articles of Smalcald, by Luther (1537), the two
   Catechisms of Luther (1529), and the Form of Concord, prepared by six
   Lutheran divines (1577).

   These nine symbols constitute together the Book of Concord (Concordia,
   or Liber Concordiæ, Concordienbuch), which was first published by order
   of Elector Augustus of Saxony in 1580, in German and Latin, and which
   superseded older collections of a similar character. [398]

   The Lutheran symbols are not of equal authority. Besides the three
   oecumenical Creeds, the Augsburg Confession is most highly esteemed,
   and is the only one which is generally recognized. Next to it comes the
   Shorter Catechism of Luther, which is extensively used in catechetical
   instruction. His Larger Catechism is only an expansion of the Shorter.
   The Apology is valuable in a theological point of view, as an authentic
   commentary on the Augsburg Confession. The Smalcald Articles have an
   historical significance, as a warlike manifesto against Rome, but are
   little used. The Form of Concord was never generally received, but
   decidedly rejected in several countries, and is disowned by the
   Melanchthonian and unionistic schools in the Lutheran Church.

   Originally intended merely as testimonies or confessions of faith,
   these documents became gradually binding formulas of public doctrine,
   and subscription to them was rigorously exacted from all clergymen and
   public teachers in Lutheran State churches. [399] The rationalistic
   apostasy, reacting against the opposite extreme of symbololatry and
   ultra-orthodoxy, swept away these test-oaths, or reduced them to a
   hypocritical formality. The revival of evangelical Christianity, since
   the tercentenary jubilee of the Reformation in 1817, was followed by a
   partial revival of rigid Lutheran confessionalism, yet not so much in
   opposition to the Reformed as to the Unionists in Prussia and other
   German States, where the two Confessions have been amalgamated. The
   meaning and aim of the Evangelical Union in Prussia, however, was not
   to set aside the two Confessions, but to accommodate them in one
   governmental household, allowing them to use either the Lutheran or the
   Heidelberg Catechism as before. The chief trouble was occasioned by the
   new liturgy of King Frederick William III., which was forced upon the
   churches, and gave rise to the Old Lutheran secession. In the other
   States of Germany, and in Scandinavia and Austria, the Lutheran
   churches have, with a separate government, also their own liturgies and
   forms of ordination, with widely differing modes of subscription to the
   symbolical books. [400]

   In the United States, the Lutherans, left free from the control of the
   civil government, yet closely connected with the doctrinal and
   confessional disputes of their brethren in Germany, are chiefly divided
   into three distinct organizations, which hold as many different
   relations to the Symbolical Books, and are, in fact, three
   denominations under a common name, viz.: the General Synod of the
   Evangelical Lutheran Church of the United States, organized in 1820;
   the Synodical Conference of North America, organized in 1872; [401] and
   the General Council, which, under the lead of the old Synod of
   Pennsylvania, seceded from the General Synod, and met first at Fort
   Wayne, Indiana, Nov. 20, 1867. The first has its theological and
   literary centre in Gettysburg, the second at St. Louis and Fort Wayne,
   the third in Philadelphia.

   The 'General Synod,' which is composed chiefly of English-speaking
   descendants of German immigrants, and sympathizes with the surrounding
   Reformed denominations, adopts simply 'the Augsburg Confession as a
   correct exhibition of the fundamental doctrines of the divine Word,'
   without mentioning the other symbolical books at all, and allows a very
   liberal construction even of the Augsburg Confession, especially the
   articles on the Sacraments. [402] With this basis the Lutheran Synod of
   the Southern States, which was organized during the civil war, is
   substantially agreed. [403]

   The Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America, which is so far
   almost exclusively German as to language, requires its ministers to
   subscribe the whole Book of Concord (including the Form of Concord),
   'as the pure, unadulterated explanation and exposition of the divine
   Word and will.' [404]

   With the Missourians are agreed the Buffalo and the Iowa Lutherans,
   except on the question of the origin and nature of the ministerial
   office, which has been the subject of much bitter controversy between
   them.

   The 'General Council,' which is nearly equally divided as to language
   and nationality, stands midway between the General Synod and the
   Synodical Conference. It accepts, primarily, the 'Unaltered Augsburg
   Confession in its original sense,' and, in subordinate rank, the other
   Lutheran symbols, as explanatory of the Augsburg Confession, and as
   equally pure and Scriptural. [405]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [398] See an account of the various Corpora Doctrinæ in Baumgarten,
   Erläuterungen, etc., pp. 247-282; Köllner, Symbolik, I. pp. 96 sqq.;
   and Müller, Symb. Bücher, pp. cxxii. sqq. The oldest was the Corpus
   Doctrinæ Christianæ Philippicum, or Misnicum, 1560, which contained
   only Melanchthonian writings, and was followed by several other
   collections of a more strictly Lutheran character.

   [399] As early as 1533 a statute was enacted in Wittenberg by Luther,
   Jonas, and others, which required the doctors of theology, at their
   promotion, to swear to the incorrupt doctrine of the Gospel as taught
   in the symbols. It was only a modification of the oath customary in the
   Roman Catholic Church. After the middle of the sixteenth century,
   subscription began to be enforced, on pain of deposition and exile. See

   Synod of Missouri, formed 1847, with 702,056 members. Two coöperative
   federations exist, namely: 1. The Am. Luth. Conference with 926,009
   members, formed 1930, consisting of five bodies, The Am. Luth. Ch., The
   Augustana Synod with 234,434 members, the Norwegian Luth. Ch., with
   303,358 members, The Luth. Free Ch. and the United Danish Churches with
   47,408 members. 2. The Evang. Synod. Luth. Conference of N. Am.,
   founded 1873, having 873,484 members, and consisting of five groups of
   which the Missouri Synod is much the largest. In addition to the United
   Luth. Ch. of Am. and the groups joined in the federations there are
   seven independent synods with 75,397 members. The groups are not to be
   regarded "as separate denominations, their main difference being in a
   gradual gradation from the freedom of the universal priesthood of
   believers to a more or less highly developed legalistic control of the
   individual." They coöperate in certain general movements through a
   National Luth. Council and some of the independent synods support the
   missions of the larger groups.--Ed.]

   fundamental doctrines of the Divine Word, and of the faith of our
   Church founded upon that Word.' (Constitution of General Synod, adopted
   at Washington, 1869, Art. II. Sect. 3.)

   of God, and the only infallible rule of faith and practice. We likewise
   hold that the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Augsburg

   the perfect harmony of one and the same Scriptural faith.' (Principles

   ORIGIN AND HISTORY.

   The Augsburg Confession, at first modestly called an Apology, after the
   manner of the early Church in the ages of persecution, was occasioned
   by the German Emperor Charles V., who commanded the Lutheran Princes to
   present, at the Diet to be held in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, an
   explicit statement of their faith, that the religious controversy might
   be settled, and Catholics and Protestants be united in a war against
   the common enemies, the Turks. [406] Its deeper cause must be sought in
   the inner necessity and impulse to confess and formularize the
   evangelical faith, which had been already attempted before. It was
   prepared, on the basis of previous drafts, and with conscientious care,
   by Philip Melanchthon, at the request and in the name of the Lutheran
   States, during the months of April, May, and June, 1530, at Coburg and
   Augsburg, with the full approval of Luther. It was signed, August 23,
   by seven German Princes (the Elector John of Saxony and the Landgrave
   Philip of Hesse, etc.) and the deputies of two free cities (Nuremberg
   and Reutlingen). This act required no little moral courage, in view of
   the immense political and ecclesiastical power of the Roman Church at
   that time. When warned by Melanchthon of the possible effects of his
   signature, the Elector John of Saxony nobly replied: 'I will do what is
   right, unconcerned about my electoral dignity; I will confess my Lord,
   whose cross I esteem more highly than all the power of the earth.'

   On the 25th of June, 1530, the Confession was read aloud, in the German
   language, [407] before the assembled representatives of Church and
   State, and in the hearing of a monarch in whose dominions the sun never
   set.

   This formed an important epoch in the history of the Reformation. The
   deputies, and the people who stood outside, listened attentively for
   two hours to the new creed. The Papists were surprised at its
   moderation. The Bishop of Augsburg is reported to have said privately
   that it contained nothing but the pure truth. Duke William of Bavaria
   censured Dr. Eck for misrepresenting to him the Lutheran opinions; and
   when the Romish doctor remarked that he could refute them with the
   Fathers, though not with the Scriptures, the Duke replied, 'I am to
   understand, then, that the Lutherans are within the Scriptures, and we
   are on the outside.' The Emperor himself, a bigoted Spaniard, a master
   in shrewd policy, little acquainted with the German language and
   spirit, and still less with theology, after respectfully listening for
   a while, fell asleep during the delivery, [408] but graciously received
   the Latin copy for his own use, and handed the German to the Elector of
   Mayence for safe keeping in the imperial archives, yet prohibited the
   publication without his permission. Both copies are lost.

   The Diet ordered a committee of about twenty Romish theologians, among
   whom were Eck, Faber, Cochlæus, and Wimpina, to prepare a refutation of
   the Confession on the spot. Their scholastic Confutatio, the result of
   five successive drafts, was a far inferior production, and made little
   impression upon the Diet, but it fairly expressed the views of the
   Emperor and the majority of the States, and was accepted as a
   satisfactory refutation of the Confession. [409] Melanchthon answered
   it by his 'Apology of the Augsburg Confession,' but the Diet refused
   even to receive the reply; and, after several useless conferences,
   resolved, Sept. 22 and Nov. 19, 1530, to proceed with violent measures
   against the Protestants if they should not return to the Catholic faith
   before the 15th of April of the following year.

   The Elector John, justly styled the Constant, with all his loyalty to
   the Emperor and wish for the peace of Germany, refused to compromise
   his conscience, and, in full view of the possible ruin of his earthly
   interest, he resolved to stand by 'the imperishable Word of God.' [410]
   The heroic spirit of the Reformers in these trying times found its
   noblest expression in the words and tune of Luther's immortal
   battle-song, based on Psalm. xlvi.:

   'A tower of strength our God is still,

   A mighty shield and weapon;

   He'll help us clear from all the ill

   That hath us now o'ertaken.

   .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

   'And though they take our life--

   Goods, honor, children, wife--

   Yet is their profit small;

   These things shall vanish all--

   The City of God remaineth.'

   LUTHER'S SHARE IN THE COMPOSITION. [411]

   Being under the papal excommunication and the imperial ban since the
   Diet of Worms (1521), Luther could not safely venture to Augsburg, but
   he closely watched the proceedings of the Diet from the Castle of
   Coburg on the Saxon frontier, praying, translating the prophets,
   writing childlike letters to his children, and manly letters to
   princes, singing Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, giving his advice at
   every important step, and encouraging his timid and desponding friend
   Melanchthon.

   He had taken the leading part in the important preparatory labors,
   namely, the Fifteen, Articles of the Marburg Conference (Oct. 3, 1529),
   [412] the Seventeen Articles of Schwabach (Oct. 16, 1529), [413] which
   correspond to the first or positive part of the Augsburg Confession,
   and the so-called Articles of Torgau (March 20, 1530), [414] which form
   the basis of its second or polemical part. But in all respects the
   Confession, especially the second part, is so much enlarged and
   improved on these previous labors that it may be called a new work.
   [415]

   Luther thus produced the doctrinal matter of the Confession, while
   Melanchthon's scholarly and methodical mind freely reproduced and
   elaborated it into its final shape and form, and his gentle, peaceful,
   compromising spirit breathed into it a moderate, conservative tone. In
   other words, Luther was the primary, Melanchthon the secondary author,
   of the contents, and the sole author of the style and temper of the
   Confession. [416]

   Luther himself was satisfied that his friend was better adapted for the
   task, and expressed his entire satisfaction with the execution. When
   the Confession was sent to him from Augsburg for revision, he wrote to
   the Elector, May 15, 1530: 'I have read the Apology [Confession] of
   Master Philip; it pleases me very well, and I know of nothing by which
   I could better it or change it, nor would it be becoming, for I can not
   move so softly and gently. May Christ our Lord help, that it may bring
   forth much and great fruit, as we hope and pray. Amen.' [417] After the
   delivery of the Confession, he wrote to Melanchthon, Sept. 15, in an
   enthusiastic strain: 'You have confessed Christ, you have offered
   peace, you have obeyed the Emperor, you have endured injuries, you have
   been drenched in their revilings, you have not returned evil for evil.
   In brief, you have worthily done God's holy work as becometh saints. Be
   glad, then, in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous. Long enough have ye
   been mourning in the world, look up and lift up your heads, for your
   redemption draweth nigh. I will canonize you as faithful members of
   Christ, and what greater glory can you desire! Is it a small thing to
   have yielded Christ faithful service, and shown yourself a member
   worthy of him?' [418]

   The only objection which Luther ever raised to the Augsburg Confession
   was that it was too gentle, and did not denounce the Pope and the
   doctrine of purgatory. [419]

   CONTENTS.

   The Augsburg Confession proper (exclusive of Preface and Epilogue)
   consists of two parts--one positive and dogmatic, the other negative
   and polemic, or rather apologetic. The first refers chiefly to
   doctrines, the second to ceremonies and institutions. The order of
   subjects is not strictly systematic, though considerably improved upon
   the arrangement of the Schwabach and Torgau Articles. In the manuscript
   copies and oldest editions the articles are only numbered; the titles
   were subsequently added.

   I. The first part presents, in twenty-one articles--beginning with the
   Triune God and ending with the worship of saints--a clear, calm, and
   condensed statement of the doctrines held by the evangelical Lutherans,
   (1) in common with the Roman Catholics, (2) in common with the
   Augustinian school, (3) in opposition to Rome, and (4) in distinction
   from Zwinglians and Anabaptists. [420]

   (1.) In theology and Christology, i.e., the doctrines of God's unity
   and trinity (Art. I.), and of Christ's divine-human personality (III.),
   the Confession strongly reaffirms the ancient Catholic faith as laid
   down in the oecumenical Creeds, and condemns (damnamus) the old and new
   forms of Unitarianism and Arianism as heresies.

   (2.) In anthropology, i.e., in the articles on the fall and original
   sin (II.), the slavery of the natural will and necessity of divine
   grace (XVIII.), the cause and nature of sin (XIX.), the Confession is
   substantially Augustinian, in opposition to the Pelagian and
   semi-Pelagian heresies. The Donatists are also condemned (VIII.) for
   denying the objective virtue of the ministry and the Sacraments, which
   Augustine defended against them.

   (3.) The general Protestant views in opposition to Rome appear in the
   articles on justification by faith (IV.), new obedience (VI.), the
   Gospel ministry (V.), the Church (VII., VIII.), repentance (XII.),
   ordination (XIV.), ecclesiastical rites (XV.), civil government (XVI.),
   good works (XIX.), the worship of saints, and the exclusive
   mediatorship of Christ (XX.). Prominence is given to the doctrine of
   justifition by faith, which, though very briefly stated in its proper
   place (P. I. Art. IV.), is elsewhere incidentally referred to as the
   essence of the Gospel. [421]

   (4.) The distinctive Lutheran views--mostly retained from prevailing
   Catholic tradition, and differing in part from those of other
   Protestant churches--are contained in the articles on the Sacraments
   (IX., X., XIII.), on confession and absolution (XI.), and the
   millennium (XVII.). The tenth article plainly asserts the doctrine of a
   real bodily presence and distribution of Christ in the eucharist to all
   communicants (without determining the mode of the presence either by
   way of consubstantiation or transubstantiation), [422] and disapproves
   of dissenting views (especially the Zwinglian, although it is not
   named). [423] The Anabaptists are expressly condemned (damnamus), like
   heretics, for their views on infant baptism and infant salvation (IX.),
   the Church (VIII.), civil offices (XVI.), the millennium and final
   restoration (XVII.). These articles, however, have long ceased to be
   held by all Lutherans. Melanchthon himself materially changed the tenth
   article in the edition of 1540. The doctrine of the second advent and
   the millennium (rejected in Art. XVII.) has found able advocates among
   sound and orthodox Lutheran divines, especially of the school of
   Bengel.

   II. The second part rejects, in seven articles, those abuses of Rome
   which were deemed most objectionable, and had been actually corrected
   in the Lutheran churches, namely, the withdrawal of the communion cup
   from the laity (I.), the celibacy of the clergy (II.), the sacrifice of
   the mass (III.), obligatory auricular confession (IV.), ceremonial
   feasts and fasts (V.), monastic vows (VI.), and the secular power of
   the bishops, as far as it interferes with the purity and spirituality
   of the Church (VII.).

   The style of the Latin edition is such as may be expected from the
   classic culture and good taste of Melanchthon, while the order and
   arrangement might be considerably improved.

   The diplomatic Preface to the Emperor is not from his pen, but from
   that of the Saxon Chancellor Brück. [424] It is clumsy, tortuous,
   dragging, extremely obsequious, and has no other merit than to
   introduce the reader into the historical situation. The brief
   conclusion (Epilogus) is from the same source, and is followed by the
   signatures of seven Princes and two magistrates. [425] Several
   manuscript copies omit both Preface and Epilogue, as not belonging
   properly to the Confession.

   CHARACTER AND VALUE.

   The Augsburg Confession breathes throughout an earnest and devout
   evangelical Christian spirit, and is expressed in clear, mild,
   dignified language. It professes to be both Scriptural and churchly,
   and in harmony even with the Roman Church as known from the genuine
   tradition of antiquity. [426] It is remarkably moderate and
   conciliatory in tone, and free from all harsh or abusive terms. It is
   not aggressive, but defensive throughout. Hence its original modest
   name Apology. [427] It pleads only for toleration and peace. It
   condemns the ancient heresies (Arianism, Manicheism, Pelagianism,
   Donatism), which were punishable according to the laws of the German
   Empire. It leaves the door open for a possible reconciliation with
   Rome. [428] Popery itself, and many of its worst abuses, are not even
   touched, at least not expressly. The modest and peaceful author wrote
   under a painful sense of responsibility, with a strong desire for the
   restoration of the unity of faith, and hence he avoided, all that might
   give unnecessary offense to the ruling party. [429]

   But the same motive made him unjust toward his fellow-Protestants, who
   differed from him far less than both differed from the Romanists. The
   Lutheran divines, after refusing at Marburg all connection with the
   Zwinglians, yet, being unable to convince the Catholic majority, felt
   that by protesting against what they regarded as ultra-Protestant
   radicalism they would better succeed in securing toleration for
   themselves. One of their leaders, however, Philip of Hesse, openly
   sympathized with Zwingli, and had to be specially urged by Luther to
   subscribe the Confession, which he did with a dissent from the tenth
   article. The majority of the citizens of Augsburg likewise adhered to
   Zwingli at that time. [430]

   The Augsburg Confession is the fundamental and generally received
   symbol of the Lutheran Church, which also bears the name of 'the Church
   of the Augsburg Confession.' It is inseparable from the theology and
   history of that denomination; it best exhibits the prevailing genius of
   the German Reformation, and will ever be cherished as one of the
   noblest monuments of faith from the pentecostal period of
   Protestantism. [431]

   But its influence extends far beyond the Lutheran Church. It struck the
   key-note to other evangelical confessions, and strengthened the cause
   of the Reformation every where. It is, to a certain extent, also the
   Confession of the Reformed and the so-called Union Churches, in
   Germany, namely, with the explanations and modifications of the author
   himself in the edition of 1540, which extended, as it were, the hand of
   fellowship to them (see below). In this qualified sense, either
   expressed or understood, the Augsburg Confession was frequently signed
   by Reformed divines and Princes, even by John Calvin, while ministering
   to the Church at Strasburg, and as delegate to the Conference of
   Ratisbon, 1541; [432] by Farel and Beza at the Conference in Worms,
   1557; by the Calvinists at Bremen, 1562; by Frederick III., (the
   Reformed) Elector of the Palatinate, at the convent of Princes in
   Naumburg, 1561, and again at the Diet of Augsburg, 1566; by John
   Sigismund, of Brandenburg, in 1614. It is true that till the close of
   the Thirty-Years' War (1648) the Reformed were tolerated in the German
   Empire only as allies of the Augsburg Confession, [433] but even
   afterwards they continued their friendly relation to it, and maintain
   it to the present day without feeling any more bound by it. [434]

   The last, and the most memorable occasion since 1530, on which this
   noble Confession was publicly acknowledged, but with a saving clause as
   to the interpretation of the tenth article relating to the doctrine of
   the Lord's Supper, was at the German Church Diet of Berlin, 1853,
   composed of over 1400 clergymen, of four denominations--Lutheran,
   German Reformed, Evangelical Unionists, and Moravians. [435]

   On this fact and the whole history of the Augsburg Confession some
   German writers of the evangelical Unionist school have based the hope
   that the Augsburg Confession may one day become the united Confession
   or oecumenical Creed of all the evangelical churches of Germany. [436]
   This scheme stands and falls with the dream of a united and national
   Protestant Church of the German Empire. Aside from other difficulties,
   the Reformed and the majority of Unionists, together with a
   considerable body of Lutherans, can never conscientiously subscribe to
   the tenth article as it stands in the proper historical Confession of
   1530; while orthodox Lutherans, on the other hand, will repudiate the
   Altered edition of 1540. The Invariata is, after all, a purely
   Lutheran, that is, a denominational symbol; and the Variata is a
   friendly approach of Lutheranism towards the Reformed communion, which
   had no share in its original production and subsequent modification,
   although it responded to it. Neither the one nor the other edition can
   be the expression of a union, or confederation of two distinct
   denominations, of which each has its own genius, history, and symbols
   of faith. Such an expression must proceed from the theological and
   religious life of both, and meet the wants of the present age. Great as
   the Augsburg Confession is, the Church will produce something greater
   still whenever the Spirit of God moves it to a new act of faith in
   opposition to the unbelief and misbelief of modern times. Every age
   must do its own work in its own way.

   THE TEXT. THE INVARIATA AND THE VARIATA. [437]

   The Augsburg Confession was first completed in Latin, [438] but the
   German text was read before the Diet. Both copies were delivered in
   manuscript to the Emperor, but both disappeared: the German copy, first
   deposited in the imperial archives at Mayence, was probably sent with
   other official documents to the Council of Trent (1545), and then to
   Rome; the Latin copy to Brussels or Spain, and no trace of either has
   been found. For two hundred years the opinion prevailed that the 'Book
   of Concord' contained the original text, until Pfaff and Weber, by a
   thorough investigation on the spot, dispelled this error. [439]

   The twenty-two manuscript copies, still extant in public or private
   libraries, are inaccurate, defective, and represent the various stages
   of revision through which the Confession passed before the 25th of
   August under the ever-improving hands of the author. There was no time,
   it seems, to make authentic copies of the final revision.

   The printed editions (six in German, one in Latin), which were hastily
   issued during the Diet by irresponsible, anonymous publishers, are full
   of errors and omissions, and were condemned by Melanchthon.

   Consequently, we must depend entirely upon the author's own printed
   editions; but even these differ very much among themselves, and the
   German text differs from the English. [440] Fortunately the changes are
   mostly verbal and immaterial, and where they alter the sense (as in the
   edition of 1540), they can be traced to their proper origin.

   By the subscription of the Lutheran Princes and the delivery at the
   Diet, the Confession had become public property, and should have
   remained unaltered. But at that time neither editors nor publishers
   were careful and scrupulous in handling official documents. Luther
   himself changed the Articles of Smalcald after they had been publicly
   acknowledged. Melanchthon regarded the Confession, not as a fixed and
   binding creed, but as a basis for negotiation with the Papists, and as
   representing a movement still in progress toward clearer light. [441]
   He therefore kept improving it, openly and honestly, in every new
   issue, as he would his own work, and in the edition of 1540 he even
   embodied some doctrinal modifications in the desire of promoting the
   cause of truth and peace.

   The editio princeps was issued by the author in both languages,
   together with the Latin Apology and a German translation of it by
   Jonas, at Wittenberg in 1531, in spite of the imperial prohibition, yet
   with the consent (though not by order) of the Elector of Saxony. [442]
   The text was taken, not from Melanchthon's own manuscript copy (which
   had been delivered to the Emperor), but, as he says, ex exemplari bonæ
   fidei (probably the private copy of the Landgrave Philip of Hesse), and
   contained already verbal changes and improvements. [443]

   The emendations in subsequent editions before 1540, though quite
   numerous, do not materially affect the sense, and seem to have been
   approved; at all events, they were acquiesced in by the Lutherans
   themselves. [444]

   But the edition of 1540, which appeared in connection with an improved
   edition of the Apology, [445] differs so widely from the first that it
   was subsequently called the Altered Augsburg Confession (Variata), in
   distinction from the Unaltered (Invariata) of 1530 or 1531. [446] It
   attracted little attention till after the death of Melanchthon (1560),
   when it created as much trouble as the insertion of the filioque clause
   in the Nicene Creed. The Altered Confession, besides a large number of
   valuable additions and real improvements in style and the order of
   subjects, [447] embodies the changes in Melanchthon's theology, [448]
   which may be dated from the new edition of his Loci communes, 1535, and
   his personal contact with Bucer and Calvin. He gave up, on the one
   hand, his views on absolute predestination, and gradually adopted the
   synergistic theory (which brought him nearer to the Roman Catholic
   system); while on the other hand (departing further from Romanism and
   approaching nearer to the Reformed Church), he modified the Lutheran
   theory of the real presence, at least so far as to allow the Reformed
   doctrine the same right in the evangelical churches. He never liked the
   Zwinglian view of a symbolical presence, nor did he openly adopt the
   Calvinistic view of a spiritual real presence, but he inclined to it,
   and regarded the difference between this and the Lutheran view as no
   bar to Christian fellowship and church communion.

   Hence in the edition of 1540 he laid greater stress on the necessity of
   repentance and good works, and softened down the strong expressions
   against the freedom of will. The other and more important change which
   gave most offense to orthodox Lutherans, is in the tenth article,
   concerning the Lord's Supper, where the clause on the real presence,
   and the disapproval of dissenting views are omitted, and the word
   exhibeantur is substituted for distribuantur. In other words, the
   article is so changed that Calvin could give it his hearty consent, and
   even Zwingli--with the exception, perhaps, of the word truly--might
   have admitted it. [449] The difference will best appear from the
   following comparison:


   Edition 1530. Latin Text. Edition 1540.

   'De Cæna Domini docent, quod corpus et sanguis Christi vere adsint, et
   distribuantur vescentibus in Cæna Domini; et improbant secur docentes.'
   [450]

   'De Coena Domini docent, quod cum pane et vino vere exhibeantur corpus
   et sanguis Christi vescentibus in Cæna Domini.'

   'Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that the body and blood of
   Christ are truly present, and are distributed (communicated) to those
   that eat in the Lord's Supper. And they disapprove of those that teach
   otherwise.'

   'Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that with bread and wine are
   truly exhibited the body and blood of Christ to those that eat in the
   Lord's Supper.'


   The difference between the two editions was first observed, not by
   Protestants, but by the Roman controversialist, Dr. Eck, at a religious
   conference in Worms early in the year 1541. Melanchthon and the Saxon
   theologians made there the altered edition the basis of negotiations,
   but Eck complained of changes, especially in Art. X., from the original
   copy of 1530, which he had procured from the archives of Mayence.
   Nevertheless, the Variata was again used, either alone or alongside
   with the Invariata, at several subsequent conferences, probably at
   Ratisbon, 1541, certainly at Ratisbon in 1546, and at Worms, 1557. It
   was expressly approved by the Lutheran Princes at a convention in
   Naumburg, 1561, as an innocent and, in some respects, improved
   modification and authentic interpretation of the Invariata. It was
   introduced into many Lutheran churches and schools, and printed (with
   the title and preface of the edition of 1530) in the first collection
   of Lutheran symbols, called Corpus Doctrinæ Philippicum, or Misnicum
   (1559). [451]

   But after 1560, strict Lutheran divines, such as Flacius and Heshusius,
   attacked the Variata, as heretical and treacherous, and overwhelmed it
   with coarse abuse. A violent theological war was waged against
   Melanchthonianism and Crypto-Calvinism, and ended in the triumph of
   genuine Lutheranisrn and the transition of some Lutheran countries to
   the Reformed Church. The 'Book of Concord' (1580) gave the text of the
   Invariata in the happy illusion of presenting it, especially the
   German, in its original form. The Melanchthonians and the Reformed
   still adhered to the Variata. The Westphalian Treaty, in 1648, formally
   embraced the Reformed, together with the Roman Catholics and Lutherans,
   in the peace of the German Empire; and henceforth subscription to the
   Augsburg Confession of 1530 or 1540 ceased to be a necessary condition
   of toleration. [452]

   The Confession, as delivered before the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, or,
   in the absence of the original text, the edition of 1531, carefully
   prepared by Melanchthon himself, is the proper historical Confession of
   Augsburg, and will always remain so. At the same time, the altered
   edition of 1540, though not strictly speaking a symbolical book of
   binding authority any where, [453] is yet far more than a private
   document, and represents an important element in the public history of
   the Lutheran Church in the sixteenth century, and the present
   theological convictions of a very large party in that denomination.

   [406] The imperial letter convening the diet, dated Bologna, Jan. 21,
   1530, was purchased by J. P. Morgan, 1911, for $25,000 and presented to
   William II., who, in turn, decorated Mr. Morgan with the order of the
   Black Eagle.--Ed.

   [407] By Dr. Christian Baier, Vice-Chancellor of the Elector of Saxony,
   after some introductory remarks of Chancellor Brück, who composed the
   Preface and the Epilogue; see below. The Emperor at first did not want
   to have it read at all, but simply presented; yielding this point, he
   sought to diminish its effect by having it read in Latin, but the
   Lutheran Princes resisted, and carried their point. 'We are on German
   soil,' said the Elector John, 'and therefore I hope your Majesty will
   allow the German language.' He did not allow it, however, to be read in
   a public session of the Diet in the large City Hall, but merely before
   a select company of Princes, counselors, and deputies of cities, in the
   small chapel of the episcopal palace, where he resided.

   [408] So Brentius, who was at Augsburg at the time, reports (cum
   Confessio legeretur, obdormivit). Considering the length of the
   document, this is not inconsistent with the other statement of Jonas
   and Spalatin, that he, like most of the other Princes, was quite
   attentive (satis attentus erat Cæsar). Nor must his drowsiness be
   construed as a mark of disrespect to the Lutherans, for he was likewise
   soundly asleep on the third of August when the Romish Confutation was
   read before the Diet.

   Augustanæ, with ample Prolegomena and the Summary of Cochlæus, see in

   [412] The German autograph of the Marburg Articles, in the handwriting
   of the Reformers, was discovered in the archives of Cassel and
   published by Prof. H. Heppe, of Marburg, Cassel, 1847, and also by
   Bindseil, in the Corpus Reform. Vol. XXVI. pp. 122-127 (in German),
   with the textual variations. The Articles are signed by Luther, Jonas,
   Melanchthon, Osiander, Agricola, and Brentius, on the part of the
   Lutherans, and by OEcolampadius, Zwingli, Bucer, and Hedio on the part
   of the Reformed. Fourteen of them were fully approved by Zwingli and
   his friends, and in the 15th, which treats of the Lord's Supper, they
   agree to disagree as to the mode of Christ's presence.

   [413] The Articuli XVII. Suobacences (which must not be confounded with
   the Twenty-two Articles of a previous convent at Schwabach, near
   Nuremberg. A.D. 1528, see Corp. Ref. Vol. XXVI. pp. 132 sqq.) were
   composed by Luther, with the aid of Melanchthon, Jonas, Osiander,
   Brentius, and Agricola. They are only a Lutheran revision and
   enlargement of the Marburg Articles, and seem to have been drawn up in
   that town, and then presented before a convent of Lutheran princes and
   delegates at Schwabach, Oct. 16, and again before a similar convent at
   Smalcald, Nov. 29. They were first published in February or March,
   1530, without the knowledge of Luther, under the title: 'Das
   Bekenntniss Martini Luthers auf den angestellten Reichstag zu Augsburg
   einzulegen, in 17 Artikel verfasst;' then by Luther himself, Wittenb.
   1530; and again by Frick, in his edition of Seckendorf's Ausführl.
   Historie vom Lutherthum. See Corp. Ref. Vol. XXVI. pp. 129-160.

   [414] The Torgau Articles (Articuli Torgavienses) were formerly often
   confounded with the Schwabach Articles, till Förstemann first
   discovered them in the archives at Weimar, and brought them to light,
   in 1833, in the first volume of his 'Urkundenbuch,' republished in the
   Corp. Ref. Vol. XXVI. pp. 161-200. They were drawn up by Luther,
   Melanchthon, Jonas, and Bugenhagen, at the command of the Elector of
   Saxony (then residing at Torgau), for presentation at the approaching
   Diet of Augsburg, and discuss the controverted articles on the marriage
   of priests, the communion of both kinds, the mass, the confession, the
   episcopal jurisdiction, ordination, monastic vows, invocation of
   saints, faith and works, etc.

   [416] Kahnis, in his Luther. Dogmatik, II. p. 424, says: 'Luther war
   der Meister des Inhalts, Melanchthon der Meister der Form. . . . Mel.
   war der Mann, welcher mit Objektivität, Feinheit, Klarheit, Milde zu
   schreiben verstand. Und wie nie hat er diese Gabe in diesem Falle
   verwerthet.' Köllner (Vol. I. p. 178), Rückert, and Heppe give all the
   credit of authorship to Melanchthon. This is true as far as the spirit
   and the literary composition are concerned; but as to the doctrines,
   Luther had a right to say, 'The Catechism, the Exposition of the Ten
   Commandments, and the Augsburg Confession, are mine.'

   [417] 'Ich hab M. Philippsen Apologiam überlesen: die gefället mir fast
   (i.e., sehr) wohl, und weiss nichts daran zu bessern noch ändern, würde
   sich auch nicht schicken; denn ich so sanft und leise nicht treten
   kann. Christus unser Herr helfe, dass sie viel and grosse frucht
   schaffe, wie wir hoffen bitten. Amen.' (De Wette's ed. of Luther's
   Letters, IV. p. 17; Luther's Works, Erlang. ed. Vol. LIV. p. 145).

   [418] 'Christum confessi estis, pacem obtulistis, Cæsari obedistis,
   injurias tolerastis, blasphemiis saturati estis, nec malum pro malo
   reddidistis: summa, opus sanctum Dei, ut sanctos decet, digne
   tractastis. Lætamini etiam aliquando in Domino et exultate, justi:
   satis diu tristati (al. testati) estis in mundo: respicite et levate
   capita vestra, appropinquat redemtio vestra. Ego canonizabo vos, ut
   fidelia membra Christi, et quid amplius quæritis gloriæ?' etc. (Briefe,
   IV. p. 165. Comp. also his letter of July 15 to Jonas, Spalatin,
   Melanchthon, Agricola, ib. IV. p. 96.)

   [419] In a letter to Justus Jonas, July 21, 1530: 'Satan adhuc vivit,
   et bene sensit Apologiam vestram Leisetreterin [the softly stepping
   Confession] dissimulasse articulos de purgatorio, de sanctorum cultu,
   et maxime de Antichristo Papa' (Briefe, IV. p. 110). Melanchthon
   himself confessed that he wrote the Confession with more leniency than
   the malice of the Papists deserved. And yet immediately after the
   delivery, which marks the height of his usefulness, the good man was in
   an almost desponding state, and was tormented by scruples whether he
   had not been conservative enough and taken too much liberty with the
   venerable Catholic Church. He was, moreover, hard pressed by Romish
   divines and politicians, and was ready to make serious concessions for
   the sake of unity and peace. Some of his best friends began unjustly to
   doubt his loyalty to evangelical truth, and Philip of Hesse, one of the
   signers of tie Confession, wrote to Zwingli, 'Master Philip goes
   backward like a crab.'

   [420] For other divisions, see Zöckler, l.c. p. 93 sqq.

   [421] Part II. Art. 5 (De discrimine ciborum): 'Of this persuasion
   concerning traditions many disadvantages have followed in the Church.
   For first the doctrine of grace is obscured by it, and the
   righteousness of faith, which is the principal part of the Gospel
   (doctrina de gratia et justitia fidei, quæ est præcipua pars
   Evangelii), and which it behoveth most of all to stand forth and to
   have the pre-eminence in the Church, that the merit of Christ may be
   well known, and faith, which believeth that sins are remitted for
   Christ's sake, may be exalted far above works.'

   [422] The wording of the article--quod corpus (in German, wahrer Leib)
   et sanguis Christi vere (wahrhaftiglich) adsint et distribuantur
   vescentibus in Cæna Domini--leaves room for both theories. The
   Papistical Confutation, while objecting to the articles de utraque
   specie and de missa, in the second part of the Augsb. Conf., was
   satisfied with Art. X. of the first part, provided only that it be
   understood as teaching the presence of the whole Christ under the bread
   as well as the wine. ('Decimus articulus in verbis nihil offendit, quia
   fatentur, in eucharistia post consecrationem legitime factam corpus et
   sanguis Christi substantialiter et vere adesse, si modo credant, sub
   qualibet specie integrum Christum adesse.') In the Apology of the
   Confession (Art. X.), Melanchthon asserts the corporalis præsentia, and
   even substitutes for vere adsint the stronger terms vere et
   substantialiter adsint. The Lutheran Church, as represented in Luther's
   writings and in the Form of Concord (R. 729), rejects
   transubstantiation, and also the doctrine of impanation, i.e., a local
   inclusion of Christ's body and blood in the elements (localis inclusio
   in pane), or a permanent and extra-sacramental conjunction of the two
   substances (durabilis aliqua conjunctio extra usum sacramenti); but it
   teaches consubstantiation in the sense of a sacramental conjunction of
   the two substances effected by the consecration, or a real presence of
   Christ's very body and blood in, with, and under (in, cum, et sub)
   bread and wine. The word consubstantiation, however, is not found in
   the Lutheran symbols, and is rejected by Lutheran theologians if used
   in the sense of impanation. The philosophical foundation of this dogma
   is the ubiquity (either absolute or relative) of Christ's body, which
   is a part of the Lutheran Christology.

   [423] Et improbant secus docentes (derhalben wird auch die Gegenlehr
   verworfen). The omission of Zwingli's name may be due to regard for his
   friend, the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, but that he was chiefly intended
   must be inferred from the antecedent controversies, especially the l5th
   Article of the Marburg Conference, and from the strong opposition of
   Melanchthon to Zwingli's theory before 1536 or 1540, when he modified
   his own view on the Eucharist. See below.

   [424] Förstemann, Urkundenbuch, etc., I. p. 460, and Bindseil, Corp.
   Ref., Vol. XXVI. p. 205. Chancellor Brück (Pontanus) wrote the Preface
   in German, and Jonas translated it into Latin. A copy in the Seminary
   Library at Wittenberg has the remark, probably from the hand of Jonas,
   after the inscription, 'Præfatio ad Cæs. Car. V.:' 'Reddita e Germanico
   Pontani tunc per Justum Jonam.

   [425] There was considerable controversy as to the genuineness of the
   signatures of two of seven Princes, viz., John Frederick of Saxony (the
   son of the Elector John) and Duke Francis of Lüneburg. See Köllner,
   l.c. pp. 201 sqq.

   [426] At the conclusion of the first part, the Confession says: 'Hæc
   fere summa est doctrinæ apud nos, in qua cerni potest, nihil inesse,
   quod discrepet a scripturis, vel ab ecclesia catholica, vel ab ecclesia
   romana, quatenus ex scriptoribus nota est,' and in the Epilogus: 'Apud
   nos nihil esse receptum contra scripturam, aut ecclesiam catholicam,
   quia manifestum est, nos diligentissime cavisse, ne qua nova et impia
   dogmata in ecclesias nostras serperent.' Hence the Confession
   frequently appeals not only to the Scriptures, but also to the Fathers
   (Augustine, Ambrose, Chrysostom, etc.) and the canon law (Decretum
   Gratiani, veteres canones, and the exemplum ecclesiæ).

   [427] Melanchthon wrote to Luther: 'Mittitur tibi Apologia nostra,
   quanquam verius Confessio est.' Afterwards it was also frequently
   called the 'Saxon Confession' and the 'Evangelische Augapfel' (Prov.
   vii. 2).

   [428] Ranke, l.c. III. p. 201: 'In diesem Sinne der Annäherung, dem
   Gefühle des Nochnichtvollkommengetrenntseins, dem Wunsche, eine wie im
   tieferen Grunde der Dinge waltende, so in einigen Einzelnheiten des
   Bekenntnisses sichtbare Verwandtschaft geltend zu machen, war die
   Confession gedacht und abgefasst.' Zöckler, l.c. p. 318: 'Die Augustana
   ist in ihren Antithesen, sowohl nach der römischen wie nach der
   reformirten Seite hin, das mildeste, friedliebendste, gegnerischer
   seits am leichtesten zu ertragende aller evangelisch-lutherischen
   Symbole.

   [429] Comp. the Preface, and the repeated assurances of Melanchthon,
   e.g., in a letter of May 21, 1530, to Joachim Camerarius (Corp. Ref.
   II. p. 57): 'Ego Apologiam paravi scriptam summa verecundia, neque his
   de rebus dici mitius posse arbitror.' And in a letter to the same,
   dated June 19 (ib. p. 119): 'Non dubitabam quin Apologia nostra
   videretur futura lenior, quam mereatur improbitas adversarioram.'

   [430] See the remarks of L. Ranke, III. p. 220 sq. Kahnis also (Luth.
   Dogm. II. p. 436) admits that 'the desire for an understanding with the
   Papists made Melanchthon a very decided opponent of the Swiss, and even
   of the Strasburgers.'

   [431] For a hearty estimate of the value of the Confession from the
   Lutheran stand-point, see Dr. Krauth's introduction to his translation,
   pp. xlvii. sqq., and his Conservative Reformation, pp. 255 sqq.: 'With
   the Augsburg Confession,' he says in both places, 'begins the clearly
   recognized life of the Evangelical Protestant Church, the purified
   Church of the West, on which her enemies fixed the name Lutheran. With
   this Confession her most self-sacrificing struggles and greatest
   achievements are connected. It is hallowed by the prayers of Luther,
   among the most ardent that ever burst from the human heart; it is made
   sacred by the tears of Melanchthon, among the tenderest which ever fell
   from the eyes of man. It is embalmed in the living, dying, and undying
   devotion of the long line of the heroes of our faith, who, through the
   world which was not worthy of them, passed to their eternal rest. The
   greatest masters in the realm of intellect have defended it with their
   labors; the greatest Princes have protected it from the sword by the
   sword; and the blood of its martyrs, speaking better things than
   vengeance, pleads forever, with the blood of Him whose all-availing
   love, whose sole and all-atoning sacrifice, is the beginning, middle,
   and end of its witness.'

   [432] Calvin wrote to Rev. Mart. Schalling, at Ratisbon, 1557: 'Nec
   vero Augustanam Confessionem repudio, cui pridem volens ac libens
   subscript, sicut eam auctor ipse interpretatus est' (Epp. p. 437).
   Similarly in his Ultima Admonitio ad Joach. Westphalum, Genev. 1557. It
   is not quite certain whether it was the Altered or the Unaltered
   Confession which Calvin subscribed at Ratisbon, but probably it was the
   former, as he says that it contained nothing contrary to his doctrine,
   and as he appealed without fear to Melanchthon himself as the best
   interpreter. The Altered edition had appeared a year before, and had
   been actually used at the previous Conference at Worms, though Eck
   protested against it. See Köllner, p. 241; Zöckler, pp. 40, 41; Ebrard,
   Dogma vom hell. Abendmahl, II. p. 450; Stähelin, Joh. Calvin, I. p.
   236; G. v. Polentz, Geschichte des französischen Calvinismus, Vol. I.
   p. 577; Vol. II. p. 62.

   [433] 'Augustanæ Confessioni addicti,' 'Augsburgische
   Confessionsverwandte.'

   [434] In the electoral, afterwards royal, house of Brandenburg, the
   Augsburg Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism have always lived in
   peace together. The Great Elector, Frederick William, as patron of the
   German Reformed, professed in their name, when the Westphalian Treaty
   was concluded, their cordial adherence to the Confession of 1530
   (Profitentur dicti Reformati Augustanam Confessionem augustissimo Imp.
   Carolo V. anno 1530 exhibitam corde et ore). There are, however, German
   Reformed congregations of a more strictly Calvinistic type (e.g., in
   Elberfeld), which would rather adopt the Canons of the Synod of Dort
   than the Augsburg Confession.

   [435] The unanimous declaration of the Berlin Church Diet reads thus:
   'The members of the German Evangelical Church Diet hereby put on record
   that they hold and profess with heart and mouth the Confession
   delivered, A.D. 1530, at the Diet of Augsburg, by the evangelical
   Princes and States to Emperor Charles V., and hereby publicly testify
   their agreement with it, as the oldest, simplest common document of
   publicly recognized evangelical doctrine in Germany (dass sie sich zu
   der im Jahr 1530 auf dem Reichstags zu Augsburg von den evangelischen
   Fürsten und Ständen Kaiser Karl V. überreichten Confession mit Herz und
   Mund halten und bekennen, und die Uebereinstimmung mit ihr, als der
   ältesten, einfachsten gemeinsamen Urkunde öffentlich anerkannter
   evangelischer Lehre in Deutschland, hiedurch öffentlich bezeugen).' So
   far orthodox Lutherans might agree. But now follows a qualification to
   save the consciences of the Reformed and Unionists: 'With this we
   connect the declaration that they and each one of them adhere to the
   particular confessions of their respective churches, and the Unionists
   to the consensus of the same; and that they do not mean to interfere
   with the different positions which the Lutherans, Reformed, and
   Unionists sustain to the Tenth Article of the Augsburg Confession, nor
   with the peculiar relations of those Reformed congregations which never
   held the Augustana as a symbol (Hiemit verbinden sie die Erklärung,
   dass sie jeder insonderheit an den besonderen Bekenntniss-Schriften
   ihrer Kirchen, und die Unirten an dem Consensus derselben festhalten,
   und dass der verschiedenen Stellung der Lutheraner, Reformirten und
   Unirten zu Artikel X. dieser Confession, und den eigenthümlichen
   Verhältnissen derjenigen Reformirten Gemeinden, welche die Augustana
   niemals als Symbol gehabt haben, nicht Eintrag geschehen soll).' See
   Evang. Kirchenztg. of Berlin, for 1853, pp. 775 sqq. While fully
   recognizing the importance of this testimony in opposition to
   rationalism and popery, we should remember, first, that it has no
   official or ecclesiastical character (the German Kirchentag, like the
   Evangelical Alliance, being merely a voluntary association without
   legislative or disciplinary power); and, secondly, that it is a
   compromise, which was expressly repudiated by the anti-Union Lutherans
   (the professors at Erlangen, Leipzig, and Rostock), as 'a frivolous
   depreciation of the most precious symbol of German Evangelical
   Christendom.'

   [436] So Dr. W. Hoffmann, late Court Chaplain of the Emperor of Germany
   (Deutschland Einst und Jetzt im Lichte des Reiches Gottes, Berlin,

   [439] The Latin text of the Book of Concord is substantially from
   Melanchthon's quarto edition of 1531, and was supposed to correspond
   entirely with an imaginary Latin manuscript in Mayence. The German text
   purports to be a true copy of the original manuscript in Mayence, but
   is derived from a secondary source, viz., the printed text in the
   Corpus Brandenburgicum, 1572, which, again, was based upon a carelessly
   written copy of the Confession before its final revision. Chancellor
   Pfaff, of Tübingen, first discovered at Mayence that the original
   German copy was lost long ago, and he published, in 1730, what was
   regarded as a true copy of the original; but he was fiercely assailed
   by Adami, Feuerlin, and others, and his discovery traced to a
   Jesuitical lie. In 1781 Georg Gottlieb Weber, chief pastor at Weimar,
   was allowed to make a thorough search in the archives of Mayence, and
   found to his surprise that the copy shown him as the original was the
   printed German octavo edition of 1540, bearing on the title-page the
   words 'Wittenberg, M.D.X.L.' He published the results of his patient
   investigation in his Kritische Geschichte der Augsb. Confession aus
   archival. Nachrichten, Frankf. a. M. 1783-4, 2 vols.

   [440] The various readings in Bindseil's edition, in the Corpus
   Reformatorum, cover as much space as the text itself.

   [441] Comp. the concluding words: 'Si quid in hoc confessione
   desiderabitur, parati sumus latiorem informationem, Deo volente, juxta
   Scripturas exhibere.'

   [442] Under the title: 'Confessio Fidei | exhibita invictiss. Imp.
   Carolo V. | Cæsaris Aug. in Comiciis | Augustæ, | Anno | M.D.X.X.X. |
   Addita est Apologia Confessionis. | Beide, Deutsch | und Latinisch. |
   Ps. 119. | Et loquebar de testimoniis tuis in conspectu Regum, et non
   confundebar. | Witebergæ.' (In 4). At the end: 'Impressum per Georgiam
   Rhau. | M.D.X.X.X.I.' This is the title of the copy in the royal
   library at Dresden, which Melanchthon gave to Luther, with the words,
   in his own handwriting (below the title): 'D. Doctari Martino. Et rogo
   ut legat et emendet.' See Corp. Ref. Vol. XXVI. p. 235. Bindseil (pp.
   246 sqq.) shows that the Confession was already printed (but not
   issued) in November, 1530, and that the whole volume, with the Apology,
   was finished in April or May, 1531. Some copies of the printed
   Confession seem to have reached Augsburg before the close of the Diet.

   [443] He wrote to Joachim Camerarius, June 26 (a day after the delivery
   at Augsburg): 'Ego mutabam et refingebam pleraque quotidie, plura etiam
   mulaturus, si nostri sumphradmones [counselors] permisissent.' Corp.
   Ref. II. p. 140. Kaiser has shown that Melanchthon made a number of
   changes in the first edition--Beitrag zu einer Kritischen
   Literär-Geschichte der Melanchthonischen Original-Ausgabe der lat. und
   deutsch. Augsb. Conf. und Apologie, Nürnberg, 1830. Comp. Köllner, l.c.
   I. p. 340, and Corp. Ref. Vol. XXVI. pp. 251 sqq.

   [444] Luther, who took similar liberty with the Smalcald Articles,
   expresses no judgment, in his writings, on these variations; but he
   must have known of them, and tolerated them as unessential, even those
   of 1540, which appeared six years before his death. The sayings
   attributed to him on this subject by both parties are apocryphal, at
   all events unreliable, viz., the word of censure: 'Philippe, Philippe,
   ihr thut nicht recht, dass ihr Augustanam Confessionem so oft ändert;
   denn es ist nicht euer, sondern der Kirchen Buch;' and the word of
   indirect approval (1546): 'Lieber Philipp, ich muss es bekennen, der
   Sache vom Abendmahl ist viel zu viel gethan' (the matter of the Lord's
   Supper has been much overdone). The latter utterance, however, which
   Luther is reported to have made shortly before his death, has received
   a high degree of probability by the discovery of the testimony of
   Pastor Hardenberg, of Bremen (1547-1550), who publicly and solemnly
   declared to have heard it, together with another living witness (Canon
   Herbert von Langen, at Bremen), from Melanchthon's own lips. See
   Erlanger Reform. Kirchenzeitung for 1853, No. 40. The first Lutheran
   divine who publicly censured and condemned the Variata was Flacius, at
   the colloquy of Weimar, 1560. He was followed by Mörlin, Stössel,
   Wigand, Chytræus, Heshusius, and others.

   [445] Under the title (as given in Corp. Reform. l.c. p. 243):
   'Confessio | Fidei exhibita | invictiss. imp. Carolo | V. Cæsari Aug.
   in Comiciis | Augustæ. | Anno. M.D.X.X.X. Addita et Apologia
   Confessionis diligenter recognita. | Psalmo CXIX. | Vitebergæ, 1540.'
   The words diligenter recognita (in the German edition, mit vleis
   emendirt) openly indicate the changes.

   [446] The best text of the Variata, with the variations of later
   editions, is given in Corp. Reform. Vol. XXVI. pp. 349 sqq.; the
   history in Köllner, I. pp. 235-267, and the books there quoted; also in
   Zöckler, l.c. pp. 35 sqq. In Vol. II. of this Symb. Library the
   principal changes are noted in foot-notes under the text of the
   Confession.

   [447] In Art. 4, 5, 6, 18, 20, 21, of Part First, and the order of the
   first five articles in Part Second.

   [448] In Art. 4, 5, 10, 18, 20.

   [449] Zöckler, l.c. p. 38, thinks that the Calvinistic view would
   require credentibus instead of vescentibus. This would be true, if the
   original distribuantur had been retained, and not exchanged for the
   more indefinite exhibeantur. He admits, however, that the tenth article
   is 'calvinisirend' and 'bucerianisirend' in the sense of the Wittenberg
   Concordia of 1536, whereby Bucer, with Melanchthon's express
   co-operation, and the subsequent consent of Calvin, endeavored to unite
   the Lutherans and the Swiss.

   [450] The German text of 1530 (1531) differs from the Latin, and is
   even stronger: 'Vom Abendmahl des Herrn wird also gelehret, dass wahrer
   Leib (the true body) und Blut Christi wahrhaftiglich (corresponding to
   the vere in the Latin text) unter (der) gestalt (under the form) des
   Brots und Weins im Abendmahl gegenwärtig sei, und da ausgetheilt und
   genommen wird (distributed and received). Derhalben wird auch die
   Gegenlehr verworfen.'

   [451] See Weber, l.c. II. pp. 214-336; Köllner, l.c. pp. 248 sqq.

   [452] Instrum. Pacis Osnabr. Art. VII. § 1: 'Unanimi quoque . . .
   consensu placuit, ut quicquid publica hæc transactio, in eaque decisio
   gravaminum ceteris Calholicis, et Augustanæ Conf. Addictis statibus et
   subditis tribuunt, it etiam iis, qui inter illos Reformati vocantur,
   competere debeat.' Quoted by Jacobson in art. Westf. Friede, in
   Herzog's Real-Encycl. XVIII. p. 24. Nevertheless, some interpreted this
   decree as including only such of the Reformed as subscribed the
   Invariata. All other Christians are expressly excluded by the Treaty;
   and yet the Popes have always, though vainly, protested in the
   strongest terms (damnamus, reprobamus, cassamus, annullamus, vacuamus)
   even against this partial concession to the principle of religious
   freedom; taking the ground that Papists alone have a legal right to
   exist on German soil. See Gieseler, Lehrbuch der K. G. III. I. p. 431
   sq.

   [453] An attempt was made in the Bavarian Palatinate, in 1853, through
   the influence of Dr. Ebrard, to raise the Variata to the dignity of a
   symbolical book, but it proved abortive.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 42. The Apology of the Augsburg Confession, A.D. 1530-1531.

   The Literature in §§ 40 and 41. The history and literature of the
   Apology are usually combined with that of the Confession. So in J. G.
   Walch, Feuerlin-Riederer, Köllner, etc.

   The best text of the Apology, and of the Roman Catholic Confutation of
   the Confession, in Latin and German, with all the variations, is given
   in the Corpus Reformatorum, Vol. XXVII., ed. Bindseil (Brunsvigæ,
   1859), pp. 646, fol. There are few separate editions of the Apology.
   Feuerlin knew only two, one under the singular title: Evangelischen
   Augapfels (name of the Augsb. Conf.) Brillen-Butzer, Leipz. 1629.


   The 'Apology of the Augsburg Confession' was prepared by Melanchthon in
   vindication of the Confession against the Roman Catholic 'Confutation,'
   which the Emperor and the Diet had ordered and accepted, August 3,
   1530, as a satisfactory answer, although, in the eyes of scholars, it
   did the cause of popery more harm than good.

   The Confutation follows the order of the Augsburg Confession, approves
   eighteen articles of the first part, either in full or with sundry
   restrictions and qualifications, but rejects entirely the articles on
   the Church (VII.), on faith and good works (XX.), and on the worship of
   saints (XXI.), and the whole second part; nevertheless, it acknowledges
   at the close the existence of various abuses, especially among the
   clergy, and promises a reformation of discipline. The publication of
   the document was prohibited, and it did not appear till many years
   afterwards; but its main contents were known from manuscript copies,
   and through those who heard it read. [454]

   The Lutherans urged Melanchthon to prepare at once a Protestant
   refutation of the Romish refutation, and offered the first draft of it
   to the Diet, Sept. 22, through Chancellor Brück, but it was refused. On
   the following day Melanchthon left Augsburg in company with the Elector
   of Saxony, and re-wrote the Apology on the journey, [455] and completed
   it at Wittenberg in April, 1531.

   The Apology is a triumphant vindication of the Confession. It far
   excels the Confutation both in theological and literary merit, and in
   Christian tone and spirit. It is written with solid learning,
   clearness, and moderation, though not without errors in exegesis and
   patristic quotations. It is seven times as large as the Confession
   itself. It is the most learned of the Lutheran symbols. It greatly
   strengthened the confidence of scholars in the cause of Protestantism.
   Its chief and permanent value consists in its being the oldest and most
   authentic interpretation of the Augsburg Confession by the author
   himself.

   The Apology, though not signed by the Lutheran Princes at Augsburg, was
   recognized first in 1532, at a convent in Schweinfurt, as a public
   confession; it was signed by Lutheran divines at Smalcald, 1537; it was
   used at the religious conference at Worms, 1540, and embodied in the
   various symbolical collections, and at last in the Book of Concord.

   The text of the Apology has, like that of the Confession, gone through
   various transformations. The original draft made at Augsburg has no
   authority. [456] The first Latin edition was much enlarged and
   improved, and appeared in April, 1531, at Wittenberg, together with a
   very free German translation by Justus Jonas, assisted by Melanchthon.
   [457] The second Latin edition of the same year was again much changed,
   and is called the Variata. [458] The German text was also transformed,
   especially in the edition of 1533. The Book of Concord took both texts
   from the first edition.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [454] The Latin text of the Confutatio was first published by Fabricius
   Leodius in Harmonia Confess., 1573; the German, by C. G. Müller, 1808,
   from a copy of the original in the archives of Mayence, which Weber had
   previously obtained. Both in the Corp. Reform. l.c. Comp. also above,
   p. 226; Weber's Krit. Gesch. der A. C. II. pp. 439 sqq.; and Hugo
   Lämmer (who afterwards joined the Romish Church): Die
   vor-Tridentinisch-Katholische Theologie, des Reformations-Zeitalters,
   Berlin, 1858, pp. 33-46.

   [455] His zeal led him to violate even the law of rest on Sunday when
   at Altenburg, in Spalatin's house. Luther took the pen from him, and
   told him to serve God on that day by resting from literary labor. So
   Salig reports in his Hist. of the Augsb. Conf. I. p. 375.

   [456] Manuscript copies of this 'Apologia prior,' which was based on an
   imperfect knowledge of the Romish Confutatio, still exist. The Latin
   text of it was published forty-seven years afterwards by Chytræus (from
   Spalatin's copy), 1578, better by Förstemann, in his Neues Urkundenbuch
   (1842), pp. 357-380 (from a copy written partly by Spalatin and partly
   by Melanchthon). The best edition is by Bindseil, in the Corp. Reform.
   Vol. XXVII. pp. 275 sqq. in Latin, and in German, pp. 322 sqq.

   [457] During the preparation of the editio princeps he wrote to
   Brentius (February, 1531): 'Ego retexo Apologiam et edetur longe
   auctior et melius munita,' and to Camerarius (March 7): 'Apologia mea
   nondum absoluta est, crescit enim opus inter scribendum.' Quoted by
   Köllner, I, p. 426. Six sheets were reprinted, and a copy of the first
   print is preserved in the library of Nuremberg. See Corp. Reform. Vol.
   XXVII. pp. 391 sqq.

   [458] See the titles of the various editions in Corp. Reform. Vol.
   XXVI. pp. 235-242, and the best text of the 'Apologia altera' of 1531,

   1531, ed. III. 1540, ed. IV. 1542), in Corp. Reform. Vol. XXVII. pp.

   CATECHETICAL INSTRUCTION.

   Religious instruction preparatory to admission to church membership is
   as old as Christianity itself, but it assumed very different shapes in
   different ages and countries. In the first three or four centuries (as
   also now on missionary ground) it always preceded baptism, and was
   mainly addressed to adult Jews and Gentiles. In length and method it
   freely adapted itself to various conditions and degrees of culture. The
   three thousand Jewish converts on the day of Pentecost, having already
   a knowledge of the Old Testament, were baptized simply on their
   profession of faith in Christ, after hearing the sermon of St. Peter.
   Men like Cornelius, the Eunuch, Apollos, Justin Martyr, Tertullian,
   Cyprian, Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, needed but little theoretical
   preparation, and Cyprian and Ambrose were elected bishops even while
   yet catechumens. At Alexandria and elsewhere there were special
   catechetical schools of candidates for baptism. The basis of
   instruction was the traditional rule of faith or Apostles' Creed, but
   there were no catechisms in our sense of the term; and even the creed
   which the converts professed at baptism was not committed to writing,
   but orally communicated as a holy secret. Public worship was
   accordingly divided into a missa catechumenorum for half-Christians in
   process of preparation for baptism, and a missa fidelium for baptized
   communicants or the Church proper.

   With the union of Church and State since Constantine, and the general
   introduction of infant baptism, catechetical instruction began to be
   imparted to baptized Christians, and served as a preparation for
   confirmation or the first communion. It consisted chiefly of the
   committal and explanation, (1) of the Ten Commandments, (2) of the
   Creed (the Apostles' Creed in the Latin, the Nicene Creed in the Greek
   Church), sometimes also of the Athanasian Creed and the Te Deum; (3) of
   the Lord's Prayer (Paternoster). To these were added sometimes special
   chapters on various sins and crimes, on the Sacraments, and prayers.
   Councils and faithful bishops enjoined upon parents, sponsors, and
   priests the duty of giving religious instruction, and catechetical
   manuals were prepared as early as the eighth and ninth centuries, by
   Kero, monk of St. Gall (about 720); Notker, of St. Gall (d. 912);
   Otfried, monk of Weissenbourg (d. after 870), and others. [459] But
   upon the whole this duty was sadly neglected in the Middle Ages, and
   the people were allowed to grow up in ignorance and superstition. The
   anti-papal sects, as the Albigenses, Waldenses, and the Bohemian
   Brethren, paid special attention to catechetical instruction. [460]

   The Reformers soon felt the necessity of substituting evangelical
   Catechisms for the traditional Catholic Catechisms, that the rising
   generation might grow up in the knowledge of the Scriptures and the
   true faith. Of all the Protestant Catechisms, those of Luther follow
   most closely the traditional method, but they are baptized with a new
   spirit.

   LUTHER'S CATECHISMS.

   After several preparatory attempts, [461] Luther wrote two Catechisms,
   in 1529, both in the German language--first the larger, and then the
   smaller. The former is a continuous exposition rather than a Catechism,
   and is not divided into questions and answers; moreover, it grew so
   much under his hands that it became altogether unsuitable for the
   instruction of the young, which he had in view from the beginning.
   Hence he prepared soon afterwards a smaller one, or Enchiridion, as he
   called it. [462] It is the ripe flower and fruit of the larger work,
   and almost superseded it, or confined its use to pastors and teachers
   and a more advanced class of pupils. [463]

   He was moved to this work by the lamentable state of religious
   ignorance and immorality among the German people, which he found out
   during his visitations of the churches in Saxony, 1527-29. [464]

   With his conservative instinct, he retained the three parts on the
   Decalogue (after the Latin division), the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer.
   To these he added, after the example of the Bohemian Brethren, an
   instruction on the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper. [465]

   Luther's Catechism proper, therefore, has five parts: 1. Decalogus; 2.
   Symbolum Apostolicum; 3. Oratio Dominica; 4. De Baptismo; 5. De
   Sacramento Altaris. So the Large Catechism, as printed in the Book of
   Concord (without any additions [466] ), and the Small Catechism in the
   first two editions (with devotional additions).

   THE ADDITIONS IN THE ENCHIRIDION.

   In the later editions of the Small Catechism (since 1564) there is a
   sixth part on Confession and Absolution, or the Power of the Keys,
   [467] which is inserted either as Part V., between Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper, or added as Part VI., or as an Appendix. The precise
   authorship of the enlarged form or forms (for they vary) of this Part,
   with the questions 'What is the Power of the Keys,' etc., is uncertain,
   [468] but the substance of it, viz., the questions on private or
   auricular confession of sin to the minister and absolution by the
   minister, as given in the 'Book of Concord,' date from Luther himself,
   and appear first substantially in the third edition of 1531, as
   introductory to the fifth part on the Lord's Supper. [469] He made much
   account of private confession and absolution, while the Calvinists
   abolished the same as a mischievous popish invention. 'True
   absolution,' says Luther, 'or the power of the keys, instituted in the
   Gospel by Christ, affords comfort and support against sin and an evil
   conscience. Confession or absolution shall by no means be abolished in
   the Church, but be retained, especially on account of weak and timid
   consciences, and also on account of untutored youth, in order that they
   may be examined and instructed in the Christian doctrine. But the
   enumeration of sins should be free to every one, to enumerate or not to
   enumerate such as he wishes.' [470]

   Besides these doctrinal sections, the Smaller Catechism, as edited by
   Luther in 1531 (partly, also, in the first edition of 1529), has three
   appendices of a devotional or liturgical character, viz.: 1. A series
   of short family prayers ('wie ein Hausvater sein Gesinde soll lehren
   Morgens und Abends sich segnen); 2. A table of duties ('Haustafel') for
   the members of a Christian household, consisting of Scripture passages
   1 Tim. iii. 2 sqq.; Rom. xiii. 1 sqq.; Col. iii. 19 sqq.; Eph. vi. 1
   sqq., etc.); 3. A marriage manual ('Traubüchlin'); and 4. A baptismal
   manual ('Taufbüchlin').

   The first two appendices, which are devotional, were retained in the
   'Book of Concord;' but the third and fourth, which are liturgical and
   ceremonial, were omitted because of the great diversity in different
   churches as to exorcism in baptism, and the rite of marriage.

   TRANSLATIONS AND INTRODUCTION.

   The Smaller Catechism was translated from the German original into the
   Latin (by Sauermann) and many other languages; even into the Greek,
   Hebrew, and Syriac. It is asserted by Lutheran writers that no book,
   except the Bible, has had a wider circulation. Thirty-seven years after
   its appearance Matthesius spoke of a circulation of over a hundred
   thousand copies.

   It was soon introduced into public schools, churches, and families. It
   became by common consent a symbolical book, and a sort of 'Lay Bible'
   for the German people. It is still very extensively used in Lutheran
   churches, though mostly with supplements or in connection with fuller
   Catechisms. In Southern Germany the Catechism of Brentius obtained a
   wide currency.

   CHARACTER, VALUE, AND DEFECTS.

   Luther's Small Catechism is truly a great little book, with as many
   thoughts as words, and every word telling and sticking to the heart as
   well as the memory. It bears the stamp of the religious genius of
   Luther, who was both its father and its pupil. [471] It exhibits his
   almost apostolic gift of expressing the deepest things in the plainest
   language for the common people. It is strong food for a man, and yet as
   simple as a child. It marks an epoch in the history of religious
   instruction: it purged it from popish superstitions, and brought it
   back to Scriptural purity and simplicity. As it left far behind all
   former catechetical manuals, it has, in its own order of excellence and
   usefulness, never been surpassed. To the age of the Reformation it was
   an incalculable blessing. Luther himself wrote no better book,
   excepting, of course, his translation of the Bible, and it alone would
   have immortalized him as one of the great benefactors of the human
   race. Few books have elicited such enthusiastic praise, and have even
   to this day such grateful admirers. [472]

   But with all its excellences it has some serious defects. It gives the
   text of the Ten Commandments in an abridged form (the Larger Catechism
   likewise), and follows the wrong division of the Romish Church, which
   omits the second commandment altogether, and cuts the tenth commandment
   into two, to make up the number. [473] It allows only three questions
   and answers to the exposition of the Creed. It gives undue importance
   to the Sacraments by making them co-ordinate parts with the three great
   divisions, and elevates even private confession and absolution, as a
   sort of third sacrament, to equal dignity. It omits many important
   articles, and contains no express instruction on the Bible, as the
   inspired record of divine revelation and the infallible rule of faith
   and practice. Hence it is found necessary, where it is used, to
   supplement it by a number of preliminary and additional questions and
   answers.

   THE TEXT OF THE ENCHIRIDION.

   The critical restoration of the best text of Luther's Small Catechism
   has only recently been accomplished by Mönckeberg, Schneider, and
   Harnack. The text of the 'Book of Concord' is unreliable.

   The editio princeps of 1529 had entirely disappeared until Mönckeberg,
   1851, published a Low-German translation from a copy in the Hamburg
   city library; and five years later (1856) Professor Harnack found an
   Erfurt reprint of the original (without date), and a Marburg reprint
   dated 1529.

   The second recension, of 1529, which contains several improvements and
   addenda, was described by Riederer, in 1765, from a copy then in the
   university library at Altdorf. This copy was supposed to have been
   transferred to Erlangen, but was discovered by Harnack in the German
   Museum at Nuremburg, and republished by him, 1856, together with a
   reprint of the editio princeps, and a Wittenberg edition of 1539, a
   valuable critical introduction, and a table of the principal variations
   of the text till 1542.

   The third recension, of 1531, was brought to light by Dr. Schneider,
   and accurately republished (but without the woodcuts and the
   Traubüchlin and Taufbüchlin), 1853, with a learned introduction and
   critical apparatus. [474] It gives the text of the five parts
   substantially as it has remained since, also the section on confession
   ('Wie man die Einfältigen soll lehren beichten'), the morning and
   evening prayers, the Benedicite and Gratias, the Haustafel, the
   Traubüchlin and the Taufbüchlin.

   In 1535 (and 1536) Luther prepared a new edition, to conform the
   Scripture texts to his translation of the Bible, which was completed in
   1534.

   The edition of 1542 ('aufs neu übersehen und zugericht') adds the
   promise to the fourth (fifth) commandment, and enlarges the 'House
   Table.'

   [459] Otfried's Catechism was newly edited by J. G. Eccard: 'Incerti
   Monachi Weissenburgensis Catechesis Theotisca Seculo IX. conscripta.'
   Hanov. 1713. It contains: 1. The Lord's Prayer, with an explanation; 2.
   The Deadly Sins; 3. The Apostles' Creed; 4. The Athanasian Creed; 5.
   The Gloria.

   [460] Comp. J. C. Köcher: Catechet. Geschichte der Waldenser,

   Catechismen der Waldenser und Böhmischen Brüder als Documente ihres
   gegenseitigen Lehraustausches. Erlangen, 1863.

   [461] They began in 1518 with a popular evangelical exposition of the
   Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. See Schneider, l.c. pp. xvii.
   sqq., and Zezschwitz, l.c. II. I. pp. 316 sqq. Nor stood he alone in
   these labors. Urbanus Regius (author of three Catechisms), Lonicer
   (Strasburg, 1523), Melanchthon (1524), Brentius (1527 or 1528),
   Lachmann (Catechesis, 1528), Rürer, Althamer, Moiban, Corvin, Rhau,
   Willich, Chytræus (1555), and other Lutherans of the Reformation
   period, wrote books for the religious instruction of the young.

   [462] First in the second edition, whose title (as given by Riederer,
   but now wanting in the copy rediscovered by Harnack, l.c. p. xxii.) is
   this: ' Enchiridion. Der kleine Catechismus für die gemeine Pfarher und
   Prediger, gemehret and gebessert durch Mart. Luther. Wittenberg,
   MDXXIX.' The title of the third edition, 1531, is: 'Enchiridion. | Der
   kleine Catechismus für die gemeine Pfarher und Prediger. | Mart. Lu.
   MDXXXI.' See Schneider, l.c. p. 1. This is the standard edition, from
   which the editions of 1539 and 1542 differ very slightly.

   [463] See, on the relation of the two, Köllner, l.c. p. 490. He says,
   p. 520: 'The Large Catechism has entirely gone out of use.' Comp. also
   Zezschwitz, l.c. p. 324. The older view of the priority of the Small
   Catechism is wrong.

   [464] He says, in his characteristic style (Preface to the Small
   Catechism): 'Diesen Katechismum oder christliche Lehre in solche
   kleine, schlechte, einfältige Form zu stellen, hat mich gezwungen und
   gedrungen die klägliche elende Noth, so ich neulich erfahren habe, da
   ich auch ein Visitator war. Hilf, lieber Gott, wie manchen Jammer habe
   ich gesehen, dass der gemeine Mann doch so gar nichts weiss von der
   christlichen Lehre, sonderlich auf den Dörfern! Und leider viel
   Pfarrherren ganz ungeschickt und untüchtig sind zu lehren; und sollen
   doch alle Christen heissen, getauft sein und der heiligen Sacramente
   geniessen; können weder Vaterunser, noch den Glauben, oder Zehn Gebote;
   leben dahin, wie das liebe Vieh und unvernünftige Säue; und nun das
   Evangelium kommen ist, dennoch fein gelernt haben, aller Freiheit
   meisterlich zu missbrauchen. O ihr Bischöfe, was wollt ihr doch Christo
   immer mehr antworten, dass ihr das Volk so schändlich habt lassen
   hingehen, und euer Amt nicht einen Augenblick je bewiesen? Dass euch
   alles Unglück fliehe! Verbietet einerlei Gestalt und treibet auf eure
   Menchengesetze, fraget aber derweil nichts danach, ob sie das
   Vaterunser, Glauben, Zehn Gebote oder einiges Gotteswort können. Ach
   und wehe über euren Hals ewiglich! Darum bitte ich um Gottes willen
   euch alle meine lieben Herren und Brüder, so Pfarrherren oder Prediger
   sind, wollet euch eures Amtes von Herzen annehmen, euch erbarmen über
   euer Volk, das euch befohlen ist, und uns helfen den Katechismus in die
   Leute, sonderlich in das junge Volk bringen; und welche es nicht besser
   vermögen, diese Tafeln und Formen vor sich nehmen, und dem Volke von
   Wort zu Wort fürbilden'

   [465] The Bohemian Brethren, or Hussites, had Catechisms long before
   Luther, divided into five parts: 1. The Decalogue; 2. The Creed; 3. The
   Lord's Prayer; 4. The Sacraments; 5. The House Table. They sent a Latin
   copy to Luther, 1523. See Köllner, l.c. pp. 485, 469.

   [466] Luther says, in the Prolegomena to the Large Catechism, 'Also
   hätte man überall Fünf Stücke der Ganzen Christlichen Lehre, die man
   immerdar treiben kann.'

   [467] 'Vom Amt der Schlüssel. De potestate clavium.' It is usually
   called 'Das sechste Hauptstück,' although it should properly be an
   appendix.

   [468] It is variously traced to Luther, Brentius (who has in his
   Catechism a sixth part 'On the Keys'), Bugenhagen, Knipstrov, but with
   greater probability to the popular Catechetical Sermons prepared for
   public use in Nuremburg and Brandenburg, 1533 (probably by Brentius),
   and translated into Latin by Justus Jonas, 1539 (and re-edited by
   Gerlach, Berlin, 1839). See Francke: Libri symbolici, etc. P. II.
   Proleg. p. xxiv.; Müller: Die Symbolischen Bücher, etc. p. xcvii.;
   Köllner, l.c. pp. 502 sqq.; Zezschwitz, l.c. pp. 327 sqq.

   [469] See the third edition, as republished by Schneider, l.c. pp. lii.
   and 45 sqq. Those questions appear under the title 'Wie man die
   Einfeltigen soll leren beichten.' An admonition to confession
   ('Vermahnung zu der Beicht') was added also to later editions of the
   Larger Catechism since 1531, but omitted in the 'Book of Concord,'
   against the remonstrance of Chemnitz.

   [470] Art. Smalc. III. p. 8. The Church of England holds a similar
   position in regard to the confessional, and hence the recent revival of
   it by the Ritualists, though under the strong protest of the
   evangelical party. The 'Book of Common Prayer' of the Church of England
   contains, besides two different forms of public confession and
   absolution (one for Morning and Evening Prayer, another for the
   Communion Service), a form of private confession and absolution in the
   Order for the Visitation of the Sick. The first two are retained, the
   third is omitted in the Prayer Book of the Protestant Episcopal Church
   of the United States. The third form, in the Visitation Office, retains
   the traditional form of the Latin Church--'Absolvo te in Nomine
   Patris,' etc.--'I absolve thee in the Name,' etc. Blunt, in his
   Annotated Book of Common Prayer, Part II. p. 283, comments largely on
   this formula, and quotes also a passage from the first exhortation in
   the Communion Office, which reads as follows: 'Therefore, if there be
   any one who . . . requireth further comfort and counsel, let him come
   to me, or to some other discreet and learned minister of God's Word,
   and open his grief; that by the ministry of God's Holy Word he may
   receive the benefit of absolution together with ghostly counsel and
   advice, to the guiding of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple
   and doubtfulness.' And after some other quotations, he says:
   'Numberless practical writers speak of private confession as a
   recognized habit in the Church of England since the Reformation as well
   as before. Nearly all such writers, however, protest against its
   compulsory injunction, and it does not seem to be proved that frequent
   and habitual confession has ever been very common in the Church of
   England since the Reformation.'

   [471] 'I am also a doctor and a preacher,' he says in the Preface to
   his Larger Catechism, 'endowed with no less learning and experience
   than those who presume so much on their abilities . . . yet I am like a
   child who is taught the Catechism, and I read and recite word by word,
   in the morning and when I have leisure, the Ten Commandments, the
   Articles of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Psalms, etc. . . . and
   must remain, and do cheerfully remain, a child and pupil of the
   Catechism.'

   [472] I quote some Lutheran testimonies which show the impressions of
   early childhood, and seem extravagant to members of other
   denominations. Matthesius: 'The world can never sufficiently thank and
   repay Luther for his little Catechism.' Justus Jonas: 'It may be bought
   for sixpence, but six thousand worlds would not pay for it.' Andr.
   Fabricius: 'A better book, next to the Bible, the sun never saw; it is
   the juice and the blood, the aim and the substance of the Bible.'
   Seckendorf: 'I have received more consolation and a firmer foundation
   for my salvation from Luther's little Catechism than from the huge
   volumes of all the Latin and Greek fathers together.' Löhe: 'It is, of
   all Confessions, that which is most suitable and best adapted to the
   people. It is a fact, which no one denies, that no other Catechism in
   the world can be made a prayer of but this. But it is less known that
   it may be called a real marvel in respect of the extraordinary fullness
   and great abundance of knowledge expressed in it in so few words.'
   Leopold Ranke: 'The Catechism published by Luther in 1529, of which he
   himself says that, old a doctor as he was, he used it himself as a
   prayer, is as childlike as it is profound, as comprehensible as it is
   unfathomable, simple, and sublime. Happy he whose soul was fed by it,
   who clings to it. He possesses at all times an imperishable
   consolation: under a thin shell, a kernel of truth sufficient for the
   wisest of the wise.' ('Der Katechismus, den Luther im Jahr 1529,
   herausgab, von dem er sagt, er bete ihn selbst, so ein alter Doctor er
   auch sei, ist ebenso kindlich wie tiefsinnig, so fasslich wie
   unergründlich, einfach and erhaben. Glückselig wer seine Seele damit
   nährte, wer daran festhält! Er besitzt einen unvergänglichen Trost in
   jedem Momente: nur hinter einer leichten Hülle den Kern der Wahrheit,
   der dem Weisesten der Weisen genug that.' Deutsche Geschichte im
   Zeitalter der Reformation, Vol. II. 3d edition, Berlin, 1852, p. 357.)
   To add an American testimony, I quote from Dr. Ch. P. Krauth: 'So truly
   did the Shorter Catechism embody the simple Christian faith, as to
   become, by the spontaneous acclamation of millions, a Confession. It
   was a private writing, and yet, beyond all the Confessions, the direct
   pulsation of the Church's whole heart is felt in it. It was written in
   the rapture of the purest catholicity, and nothing from Luther's pen
   presents him more perfectly, simply as a Christian; not as the prince
   of theologians, but as a lowly believer among believers' (The
   Conservative Reformation, Philadelphia, 1872, p. 285).

   [473] The Lutheran and the Roman Catholic Catechisms, following the
   lead of Augustine, regard the second commandment only as an explanation
   of the first; the Reformed and the Greek Catechisms, following the
   division of the Jews (Josephus and Philo) and the early Christians (e.
   g. Origen), treat it as a separate commandment, which prohibits image
   worship and enjoins the true worship of God, while the first prohibits
   idolatry and enjoins monotheism. Hence the different modes of counting
   from the second to the ninth commandment. The division of the tenth
   commandment follows as a necessity from the omission of the second, but
   is decidedly refuted by the intrinsic unity of the tenth commandment,
   and by a comparison of Exod. xx. 17 with Deut. v. 21; for in the latter
   passage (as also in the Septuagint version of Exod. xx. 17) the order
   is transposed, and the neighbor's wife put before the neighbor's house,
   so that what is the ninth commandment in Exodus, according to the Roman
   Catholic and Lutheran view, would be the tenth according to
   Deuteronomy. St. Paul, moreover, in enumerating the commandments of the
   second table, Rom. xiii. 9 (comp. also vii. 7), alludes to the tenth
   with the words, 'Thou shalt not covet,' without intimating any such
   division. Comp. also Mark x. 19. The Decalogue consists of two tables,
   of five commandments each. The first contains the duties to God
   (præcepta pietatis), the second the duties to men (præcepta
   probitatis); the first is strictly religious, the second moral. The
   fifth commandment belongs to the first table, since it enjoins
   reverence to parents as representing God's authority on earth. This
   view is now taken not only by Reformed, but also by many of the ablest
   Lutheran divines, e.g., Oehler, Theologie des Alten Testaments
   (Tübingen, 1873), I. pp. 287 sqq.; H. Schultz, Alttestamentliche
   Theologie (Frankf. a. M. 1869), I. p. 429. On the other hand, Kurtz,
   Kahnis, and Zezschwitz defend the Lutheran division. The main thing, of
   course, is not the dividing, but the keeping of the commandments.

   second volume of this work.

   ORIGIN.

   Pope Paul III., yielding at last to the request of the German Emperor
   and the pressure of public opinion, convoked a general Council, to be
   opened May 23, 1537, at Mantua, [475] and extended, through his legate,
   Peter Paul Vergerius (who subsequently became a Protestant), an
   invitation also to the Lutherans. [476] Though by no means sanguine as
   to the result, Luther, by order of the Elector of Saxony (Dec. 11,
   1536), prepared a Creed as a basis of negotiations at the Council,
   submitted it to Amsdorf, Agricola, Spalatin, and Melanchthon for
   approval, and sent it to the Elector, Jan. 3, 1537.

   Melanchthon, at the request of the convent assembled at Smalcald,
   prepared an Appendix on the power and primacy of the Pope, about which
   the Augsburg Confession and Apology are silent.

   SIGNATURE. MELANCHTHON'S POSITION.

   The Articles, including the Appendix, were laid before the convent of
   Lutheran Princes and theologians held in the town of Smalcald
   (Schmalkalden), in Thuringia, which lent its name to the political
   league of those Princes for mutual protection, and also to this new
   Creed. [477] They were signed by the theologians (but not by the
   Princes) without being publicly discussed. [478]

   Melanchthon signed the Articles with the following remarkable
   qualification: 'I, Philip Melanchthon, approve the foregoing Articles
   as pious and Christian. But in regard to the Pope, I hold that, if he
   would admit the Gospel, we might also permit him, for the sake of peace
   and the common concord of Christendom, to exercise, by human right, his
   present jurisdiction over the bishops, who are now or may hereafter be
   under his authority.' [479]

   This remarkable concession strongly contrasts with the uncompromising
   anti-popery spirit of the Articles, and exposed Melanchthon to much
   suspicion and abuse. It is self-contradictory and impracticable, since
   the Pope and his hierarchy will never allow the free preaching of the
   Gospel in the Protestant sense. But the author's motive was a noble
   desire for a more independent and dignified position of the Church. He
   feared--and not without good reason--a worse than papal tyranny from
   rapacious Protestant Princes, who now exercised the power of supreme
   bishops and little popes in their territories. He sincerely regretted
   the loss, not of the episcopal domination, but of the episcopal
   administration, as a check upon secular despotism. [480]

   CONTENTS.

   The Articles of Smalcald consist of three parts.

   The first reaffirms, very briefly in four articles, the doctrines of
   the Apostles' and Athanasian Creeds, about which there was no dispute
   with the Papists. It corresponds to Articles I. and III. of the
   Augsburg Confession.

   The second and principal part, concerning 'the office and work of
   Christ, or our redemption,' is polemical against the mass, purgatory,
   the invocation of saints, monasticism, and popery, which interfere and
   set aside the true doctrine of redemption. Justification by faith alone
   is emphasized as the chief article of faith, 'upon which depends all
   that we teach and do against the Pope, the devil, and all the world. We
   must, therefore, be entirely certain of this, and not doubt it,
   otherwise all will be lost, and the Pope, and the devil, and our
   opponents will prevail and obtain the victory.' The mass is denounced
   as 'the greatest and most horrible abomination,' [481] purgatory as a
   'satanic delusion,' the Pope as 'the true Antichrist' predicted by Paul
   (2 Thess. ii. 4), because 'he will not permit Christians to be saved
   without his power.'

   The third part treats, in fifteen articles, of sin, of the law, of
   repentance, of the sacraments, and other doctrines and ordinances,
   concerning which Protestants may dispute either among themselves or
   with 'learned and sensible men' (i.e., Catholics in the Council, but
   not with the Pope, who is said to have no conscience, and to care only
   about 'gold, honor, and power'). In the article on the Lord's Supper,
   transubstantiation is expressly excluded, but otherwise the Lutheran
   doctrine is asserted even in stronger terms than in the Augsburg
   Confession (viz. that 'the true body and blood of Christ are
   administered and received, not only by pious, but also by impious
   Christians.' [482] Luther concludes with spicy remarks against the
   juggling tricks of the Pope.

   The Appendix of Melanchthon is a theological masterpiece for his age,
   written in a calm, moderate, and scholarly tone; and refutes, from the
   Bible and from the history of the early Church, these three assumptions
   of the Pope, as 'false, impious, tyrannical, and pernicious in the
   extreme,' viz.: 1. That the Pope, as the Vicar of Christ, has by divine
   right supreme authority over the bishops and pastors of the whole
   Christian world; 2. That he has by divine right both swords, that is,
   the power to enthrone and dethrone kings, and to regulate civil
   affairs; 3. That Christians are bound to believe this at the risk of
   eternal salvation. He also shows from Scripture and from Jerome that
   the power and jurisdiction of bishops, as far as it differs from that
   of other ministers, is of human origin, and has been grossly abused in
   connection with the papal tyranny.

   CHARACTER AND AUTHORITY.

   It is clear from this outline that the Articles of Smalcald mark a
   considerable advance in the final separation of the Lutheran body from
   the Church of Rome. Luther left Smalcald in bad health (he suffered
   much of the stone), with the prayer that God may fill his associates
   with hatred of the Pope, and wrote as his epitaph,

   'Pestis eram vivus, moriens tua mors ero, Papa.'

   The Articles themselves differ from the Augsburg Confession as much as
   Luther differs from Melanchthon. They are more fresh, vigorous, and
   original, but less cautions, wise, circumspect, and symmetrical. They
   are not defensive, but aggressive; not an overture of peace, but a
   declaration of war. They scorn all compromises, and made a
   reconciliation impossible. They were, therefore, poorly calculated to
   be a basis of negotiation at a general Council, and were, in fact,
   never used for that purpose. The Convent at Smalcald resolved not to
   send any delegates to the Council. But the Smalcald Articles define the
   position of Lutheranism towards the Papacy, and give the strongest
   expression to the doctrine of justification by faith. They accordingly
   took their place, together with the Appendix, among the symbolical
   books of the Lutheran Church, and were received into various Corpora
   Doctrinæ, and at last into the 'Book of Concord.' [483]

   TEXT. [484]

   Luther prepared the Smalcald Articles at Wittenberg in the German
   language, and edited them, in 1538, with a preface and considerable
   changes and additions, but without the signatures, and without the
   Appendix of Melanchthon. In 1543 and 1545 he issued new editions with
   slight changes. The first draft, as copied by Spalatin, and signed at
   Smalcald, was published from the archives of Weimar in 1553, together
   with Luther's additions and Melanchthon's Appendix, and embodied in the
   'Book of Concord.' [485]

   The Latin text, as it appeared in the first edition of the 'Book of
   Concord,' was a poor translation, but was much improved in the edition
   of 1584.

   Melanchthon wrote the Appendix at Smalcald in Latin, but a German
   translation by Dietrich was signed there, and passed, as the supposed
   original, into the works of Luther and the first edition of the 'Book
   of Concord' (1580). The corrected Latin edition of 1584 gave the Latin
   original, but as the work of all the theologians convened at Smalcald.
   [486] This error prevailed nearly two hundred years, until the careful
   researches of Bertram dispelled it.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [475] It did not convene, however, till 1545, in Trent, and then it
   turned out an exclusive Roman Catholic Council.

   [476] Vergerius had a fruitless interview with Luther in the electoral
   castle at Wittenberg, which was characteristic of both parties. The
   papal nuncio acted the proud prelate and shrewd Italian diplomatist;
   the Reformer, the plain, free-spoken German. Luther took the matter in
   good humor, sent for the barber, and put on his best dress to impress
   the nuncio with his youth and capacity for even greater mischief to the
   Pope than he had done already. He scorned his tempting offers, and told
   him frankly that he cared very little about his master and his Council
   at Mantua or elsewhere, but promised to attend it, and there to defend
   his heretical opinions against the whole world. Vergerius, in his
   report, speaks contemptuously of Luther's poor Latin, rude manners,
   obstinacy, and impudence; but some years afterwards he renounced
   Romanism, and became the Reformer of the Grisons in Eastern
   Switzerland. He died October 4, 1565, at Tübingen, where he spent his
   last years, without office, but in extensive literary activity and
   correspondence. See the monograph of Sixt: Petrus Paulus Vergerius,
   Braunschweig, 1855, pp. 35-45.

   [477] 'Schmalkaldische Artikel, Articuli Smalcaldici,' so called since
   1553. The original title is: 'Artikel christlicher Lehre, so da hätten
   sollen aufs Concilium zu Mantua, oder wo es sonst worden wäre,
   überantwortet werden von unsers Theils wegen, und was wir annehmen oder
   nachgeben könnten oder nicht, durch D. Martin Luthern geschrieben, Anno
   1537.'

   [478] The Princes on that occasion required their theologians to sign
   also the Augsburg Confession and Apology, but they resolved to have
   nothing to do with the Pope's Council. The Appendix has thirty-two
   signatures, the Articles have forty-two, obtained partly at Smalcald
   and partly on the journey. The principal signers are Luther,
   Melanchthon, Jonas, Spalatin, Bugenhagen, Amsdorf, Bucer, and Brentius.
   See Köllner, pp. 445 sqq., and Plitt, De auctoritate Articuloram
   Smalcaldicorum (Erlang. 1862), with the strictures of Heppe, Entstehung
   und Fortbildung des Lutherthums (Cassel, 1863), pp. 252 sqq.

   [479] ' De pontifice autem statuo, si evangelium admitteret (so er das
   Evangelium woltte zulassen), ei propter pacem et communem
   tranquillitatem Christianorum, qui iam sub ipso sunt et in posterum sub
   ipso erunt, superioritatem in episcopos, quam alioqui habet, jure
   humano etiam a nobis permitti.' Sander (p. 488) thinks that Melanchthon
   did not mean this authority to apply to Protestants. But this is
   inconsistent with the words 'etiam a nobis.'

   [480] ' Utinam, utinam'--he wrote to his friend, Joach. Camerarius,
   Aug. 31, 1530--'possim non quidem dominationem confirmare, sed
   administrationem restituere episcoporum. Video enim, qualem simus
   habituri Ecclesiam, dissoluta politeia ecclesiastica. Video postea
   multo intolerabiliorem futuram tyrannidem, quam antea unquam fuit'
   (Corp. Reform. Vol. II. p. 334. Comp. his letter of Sept. 4, 1530, to
   the same, p. 341). Köllner defends Melanchthon's course.

   [481] Luther calls it also 'the dragon's tail (Drachenschwanz), which
   has produced a multiplicity of abominations and idolatries'
   (multiplices abominationes et idololatrias. In German: viel Ungeziefers
   und Geschmeiss mancherlei Abgötterei), P. II Art. 2. He says that the
   mass will be the chief thing in the proposed Council, and will never be
   yielded by the Papists. Cardinal Campeius had told him at Augsburg he
   would rather be torn to pieces than allow the mass to be discontinued.
   So would he (Luther) rather be reduced to ashes than allow a performer
   of the mass to be equal to our Lord and Saviour.

   [482] Heppe (l.c. p. 253 sq.) says that Luther in his first draft used
   simpler language, viz., that 'the body and blood of Christ are offered
   with the bread and with the wine;' but that Amsdorf insisted on a
   stronger, anti-Melanchthonian statement.

   NAME. ORIGIN AND OCCASION.

   The Form of Concord (Formula Concordiæ), the last of the Lutheran
   Confessions, completed in 1577 and first published in 1580, is named
   from its aim to give doctrinal unity and peace to the Lutheran Church,
   after long and bitter contention. [487] The work was occasioned by a
   series of doctrinal controversies, which raged in the Lutheran Church
   for thirty years with as much passion and violence as the trinitarian
   and christological controversies in the Nicene age. They form a
   humiliating and unrefreshing, yet instructive and important chapter in
   the history of Protestantism. The free spirit of the Reformation, which
   had fought the battles against the tyranny of the Papacy and brought to
   light the pure doctrines of the Gospel, gave way to bigotry and
   intolerance among Protestants themselves. Calumny, abuse, intrigue,
   deposition, and exile were unsparingly employed as means to achieve
   victory. Religion was confounded with theology, piety with orthodoxy,
   and orthodoxy with an exclusive confessionalism. Doctrine was
   overrated, and the practice of Christianity neglected. The contending
   parties were terribly in earnest, and as honest and pious in their
   curses as in their blessings; they fought as if the salvation of the
   world depended on their disputes. Yet these controversies were
   unavoidable in that age, and resulted in the consolidation and
   completion of the Lutheran system of doctrine. All phases and types of
   Christianity must develop themselves, and God overrules the wrath of
   theologians for the advancement of truth.

   LUTHER AND MELANCHTHON.

   The seeds of these controversies lay partly and chiefly in the
   theological differences between Luther and Melanchthon in their later
   years, partly in the relations of Lutheranism to Romanism and
   Calvinism.

   Luther the Reformer, and Melanchthon the Teacher of Germany,
   essentially one and inseparable in mind and heart, in doctrine and
   life, represented in their later period, which may be dated from the
   year 1533, two types of Lutheranism, the one the conclusive and
   exclusive, the other the expansive and unionistic type. Luther, at
   first more heroic and progressive, became more cautions and
   conservative; while Melanchthon, at first following the lead of the
   older and stronger Luther, became more independent and liberal.

   Luther, as the Reformer of the Romish Church, acted in the general
   interest of evangelical religion, and enjoys the admiration and
   gratitude of all Protestants; Luther, as the leader of a particular
   denomination, assumed a hostile attitude towards other churches, even
   such as rested on the same foundation of the renewed gospel. After his
   bold destructive and constructive movements, which resulted step by
   step in the emancipation from popery, he felt disposed to rest in his
   achievements. His disgust with the radicalism and fanaticism of
   Carlstadt and Münzer, his increasing bodily infirmities, and his
   dissatisfaction with affairs in Wittenberg (which he threatened to
   leave permanently in 1544), cast a cloud over his declining years. He
   had so strongly committed himself, and was so firm in his convictions,
   that he was averse to all further changes and to all compromises. He
   was equally hostile to the Pope, whom he hated as the very antichrist,
   and to Zwingli, whom he regarded as little better than an infidel.
   [488]

   Melanchthon, on the other hand, with less genius but more learning,
   with less force but more elasticity, with less intuition but more logic
   and system than Luther, and with a most delicate and conscientious
   regard for truth and peace, yet not free from the weakness of a
   compromising and temporizing disposition, continued to progress in
   theology, and modified his views on two points--the freedom of the will
   and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist; exchanging his
   Augustinianism for Synergism, and relaxing his Lutheranism in favor of
   Calvinism; in both instances he followed the ethical, practical, and
   unionistic bent of his mind. A minor difference on the human right of
   the papacy and episcopacy appeared in private letters and in his
   qualified subscription to the Smalcald Articles (1537), but never
   assumed a serious, practical aspect, except indirectly in the
   adiaphoristic controversy. [489]

   These changes were neither sudden nor arbitrary, but the result of
   profound and constant study, and represented a legitimate and necessary
   phase in the development of Protestant theology, which was publicly
   recognized in various ways before the formation of the 'Form of
   Concord.' If there ever was a modest, cautious, and scrupulously
   conscientious scholar, it was Melanchthon. 'There is not a day nor a
   night for the last ten years,' he assures an intimate friend, 'that I
   did not meditate upon the doctrine of the Lord's Supper.' [490]

   As to human freedom, Melanchthon at first denied it altogether, like
   Luther and the other Reformers, and derived all events and actions,
   good and bad, from the absolute will of God. [491] Then he avoided the
   doctrine of predestination, as an inscrutable mystery, and admitted
   freedom in the sphere of natural life and morality, but still denied it
   in the spiritual sphere or the order of grace. [492] At last (after
   1535) he openly renounced determinism or necessitarianism, as a Stoic
   and Manichæan error, and taught a certain subordinate co-operation of
   the human will in the work of conversion; maintaining that conversion
   is not a mechanical or magical, but a moral process, and is brought
   about by the Holy Spirit through the Word of God, with the consent, yet
   without any merit of man. The Spirit of God is the primary, the Word of
   God the secondary or instrumental agent of conversion, and the human
   will allows this action, and freely yields to it. [493]

   This is the amount of his Synergism, so called by his opponents. It
   resembles, indeed, semi-Pelagianism in maintaining a remnant of freedom
   after the fall, and furnished a basis for negotiations with moderate
   Romanists, but it differs from it materially in ascribing the
   initiative and the whole merit of conversion to God's grace. He never
   gave up the doctrine of justification by the free grace and sole merit
   of Christ through faith, but in his later years he laid greater stress
   on the responsibility of man in accepting or rejecting the gospel, and
   on the necessity of good works as evidences of justifying faith.

   As to the Lord's Supper, he at first fully agreed with Luther's view,
   under the impression that it was substantially the old Catholic
   doctrine held by the fathers, for whom he had great regard, especially
   in matters of uncertain exegesis. [494] He also shared his dislike of
   Zwingli's theological radicalism, and was disposed to trace it to a
   certain insanity. [495] But his deeper and long-continued study of the
   subject, and his correspondence and personal intercourse with Bucer and
   Calvin, gradually convinced him that St. Augustine and other fathers
   favored rather a figurative or symbolical interpretation of the words
   of institution, [496] and that the Scriptures taught a more simple,
   spiritual, and practical doctrine than either transubstantiation or
   consubstantiation. Owing to his characteristic modesty and caution, and
   his deep sense of the difficulties surrounding the problem, he did not
   set forth a fully developed theory or definition of the mode of
   Christ's presence, but he substantially agreed with Bucer and Calvin.
   He gave up the peculiar features of Luther's doctrine, viz., the
   literal interpretation of the words of institution, and the oral
   manducation of the body of Christ. [497] He also repeatedly rejected
   (as, in fact, he never taught) the Lutheran dogma of the ubiquity of
   Christ's body, as being inconsistent with the nature of a body and with
   the fact of Christ's ascension to heaven and sitting in heaven, whence
   he shall return to judgment. [498] But he never became a Zwinglian; he
   held fast to a spiritual real presence of the person (rather than the
   body) of Christ, and a fruition of his life and benefits by faith. In
   one of his last utterances, shortly before his death, he represented
   the idea of a vital union and communion with the person of Christ as
   the one and only essential thing in this sacred ordinance. [499]

   Luther no doubt felt much grieved at these changes, and was strongly
   pressed by contracted and suspicious minds to denounce them openly, but
   he was too noble and generous to dissolve a long and invaluable
   friendship, which forms one of the brightest chapters in his life and
   in the history of the German Reformation. [500] He kept down the rising
   antagonism by the weight of his personal authority, although he foresaw
   the troubles to come. [501] After his death (1546) the war broke out
   with unrestrained violence. Melanchthon was too modest, peaceful, and
   gentle for the theological leadership, which now devolved upon him; he
   kept aloof from strife as far as possible, preferring to bear injury
   and insult with Christian meekness, and longed to be delivered from the
   'fury of the theologians' (a rabie theologorum), which greatly
   embittered his declining years. [502] He left the scene of discord
   April 19, 1560, fourteen years after Luther. His last wish and prayer
   was 'that the churches might be of one mind in Jesus Christ.' He often
   repeated the words, 'Let them all be one, even as thou, Father, art in
   me, and I in thee.' He died with the exclamation, 'O God, have mercy
   upon me for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ! In thee, O Lord, have I
   put my trust; I shall not be confounded forever and ever.' The earthly
   remains of the "Præceptor Germamiæ" were deposited beneath the castle
   church of Wittenberg alongside of Luther's: united in life, they sleep
   together in death till the morning of the resurrection to everlasting
   life.

   LUTHERANS AND PHILIPPISTS.

   The differences between Luther the second and Melanchthon the second,
   if we may use this term, divided the theologians of the Augsburg
   Confession into two hostile armies.

   The rigid Lutheran party was led by Amsdorf, Flacius, Wigand, Gallus,
   Judex, Mörlin, Heshus, Timann, and Westphal, and had its headquarters
   first at Magdeburg, then at the University of Jena, and at last in
   Wittenberg (after 1574). They held fast with unswerving fidelity to the
   anti-papal and anti-Zwinglian Luther, as representing the ultimate form
   of sound orthodoxy. They swore by the letter, but had none of the free
   spirit of their great master. [503] They outluthered Luther, made a
   virtue of his weakness, constructed his polemic extravagances into
   dogmas, and contracted the catholic expansiveness of the Reformation
   into sectarian exclusiveness. They denounced every compromise with
   Rome, and every approach to the Reformed communion, as cowardly
   treachery to the cause of evangelical truth.

   Among these Lutherans, however, we must distinguish three classes--the
   older friends of Luther (Jonas, his colleague, and Amsdorf, whom he had
   consecrated Bishop of Naumburg 'without suet or grease or coals'), the
   younger and stormy generation headed by Flacius, and the milder framers
   of the 'Form of Concord' (Andreæ, Chemnitz, Selnecker, and Chytræus),
   who stood mediating between ultra-Lutheranism and Melanchthonianism.

   The Melanchthonians, nicknamed Philppists and Crypto-Calvinists, [504]
   prominent among whom were Camerarius, Bugenhagen, Eber, Crell, Major,
   Cruciger, Strigel, Pfeffinger, Peucer (physician of the Elector of
   Saxony, and Melanchthon's son-in-law), had their stronghold in the
   Universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig (till 1574), and maintained,
   with less force of will and conviction, but with more liberality and
   catholicity of spirit, the right of progressive development in
   theology, and sought to enlarge the doctrinal basis of Lutheranism for
   a final reconciliation of Christendom, or at least for a union of the
   evangelical churches. [505]

   Both parties maintained the supreme authority of the Bible, but the
   Lutherans went with the Bible as understood by Luther, the Philippists
   with the Bible as explained by Melanchthon; with the additional
   difference that the former looked up to Luther as an almost inspired
   apostle, and believed in his interpretation as final, while the latter
   revered Melanchthon simply as a great teacher, and reserved a larger
   margin for reason and freedom. [506]

   Both parties set forth new confessions of faith and bulky collections
   of doctrine (Corpora Doctrinæ), which were clothed with symbolical
   authority in different territories, and increased the confusion and
   intensified the antagonism. [507]

   THE THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSIES IN THE LUTHERAN CHURCH.

   The controversies which preceded the composition of the 'Form of
   Concord,' centred in the soteriological doctrines of the Reformation,
   concerning sin and grace, justification by faith, and the use of good
   works, but they extended also to the eucharist and the person and work
   of Christ. We notice them in the order of the 'Form of Concord.'

   I. THE FLACIAN CONTROVERSY ON ORIGINAL SIN, 1560-1580. [508]

   This controversy involved the question whether original sin is
   essential or accidental--in other words, whether it is the nature of
   man itself or merely a corruption of nature. It arose, in close
   connection with the Synergistic controversy, from a colloquy at Weimar
   between Flacius and Strigel (1560), extended from Saxony as far as
   Austria, and continued till the death of Flacius (1575), and even after
   the completion of the 'Form of Concord.' [509]

   Matthias Flacius Illyricus, the impetuous and belligerent champion of
   rigid Lutheranism, a man of vast learning, untiring zeal, unyielding
   firmness, and fanatical intolerance, renewed apparently the Manichean
   heresy, and thereby ruined himself. [510] From an over-intense
   conviction of total depravity, he represented original sin as the very
   substance or essence of the natural man, who after the fall ceased to
   be in any sense the image of God, and became the very image of Satan.
   He made, however, a distinction between two substances in man--a
   physical and ethical--and did not mean to teach an evil matter in the
   sense of Gnostic and Manichean dualism, but simply an entire moral
   corruption of the moral nature, which must be replaced by a new and
   holy nature. He departed not so much from the original Protestant
   doctrine of sin as from the usual conception of the Aristotelian terms
   substance and accidens. [511] He quoted many strong passages from
   Luther, but he found little favor and bitter opposition even among his
   friends, and was deposed and exiled with forty-seven adherents. The
   chief argument against him was the alternative that his doctrine either
   makes Satan the creator of man, or God the author and preserver of sin.

   II. THE SYNERGISTIC CONTROVERSY (1550--1567). [512]

   It extended over the difficult subject of man's freedom and his
   relation to the converting grace of God. It was a conflict between the
   original Augustinianism of the Reformers and the later Melanchthonian
   Synergism, or a refined evangelical modification of semi-Pelagianism.
   [513]

   Pfeffinger, Professor in Leipzig, who opened the controversy by an
   academic dissertation (1550), and then wrote a book on the freedom of
   the will (1555), Major, Eber, and Crell, in Wittenberg, and Victorin
   Strigel, in Jena, advocated a limited freedom in fallen man, as a
   rational and responsible being, namely, the power of accepting the
   prevenient grace of God, [514] with the corresponding power of
   rejecting it. They accordingly assigned to man a certain though very
   small share in the work of conversion, which Pfeffinger illustrated by
   the contribution of a penny towards the discharge of a very large debt.

   Amsdorf, Flacius, Wigand, and Heshusius, on the other hand, appealing
   to the teaching of Luther, [515] maintained that man, being totally
   corrupt, can by nature only resist the Spirit of God, and is converted
   against and in spite of his perverse will, or must receive a new will
   before he can accept. God converts a man as the potter moulds the clay,
   as the sculptor carves a statue of wood or stone. They also advocated,
   as a logical consequence, Luther's original theory of an unconditional
   predestination and reprobation. But the 'Form of Concord' rejected it
   as well as Synergism, without attempting to solve the difficulty.

   Both parties erred in not making a proper distinction between
   regeneration and conversion, and between receptive and spontaneous
   activity. In regeneration, man is passive, in conversion he is active
   in turning to God, but in response to the preceding action of divine
   grace, which Augustine calls the gratia præveniens. Conversion
   certainly is not a compulsory or magical, but an ethical process. God
   operates upon man, not as upon a machine or a dead stone (as Flacius
   and also the 'Form of Concord' maintain), but as a responsible,
   rational, moral, and religiously susceptible though very corrupt being;
   breaking his natural hostility, making willing the unwilling, and
   preparing him at every step for corresponding action. So far
   Melanchthon was right. But the defect of the Synergistic theory is the
   idea of a partnership between God and man, and a corresponding division
   of work and merit. Synergism is less objectionable than
   semi-Pelagianisrn, for it reduces co-operation before conversion to a
   minimum, but even that minimum is incompatible with the absolute
   dependence of man on God.

   III. THE OSIANDRIC CONTROVERSY (1549-1566). [516]

   It touched the central doctrine of Evangelical Lutheranism,
   justification by faith, whether it is a mere declaratory, forensic art
   of acquittal from sin and guilt, or an actual infusion of
   righteousness.

   Luther and the other Reformers made a clear distinction between
   justification as an external act of God for man, and sanctification as
   an internal act of God in man; and yet viewed them as inseparable,
   sanctification being the necessary effect of justification. Faith was
   to them an appropriation of the whole Christ, a bond of vital union
   with his person first, and in consequence of this a participation of
   his benefits. [517]

   In the Osiandric controversy, justification and sanctification were
   either confounded or too abstractedly separated, and the person of
   Christ was lost sight of in his work or in one of his two natures.

   Andrew Osiander (1498-1552), an eminent Lutheran minister and reformer
   at Nuremberg (since 1522), afterwards Professor at Königsberg (1549), a
   man of great learning and speculative talent, but conceited and
   overbearing, created a great commotion by a new doctrine of
   justification, which he brought out after the death of Luther. [518] He
   assailed the forensic conception of justification, and taught instead a
   medicinal and creative act, whereby the sinner is made just by an
   infusion of the divine nature of Christ, which is our righteousness.
   This view was denounced as Romanizing, but it is rather mystical. He
   did not make justification a gradual process, like the Roman system,
   but a single and complete act, by which Christ according to his divine
   nature enters the soul of man through the door of faith. [519] He meant
   justification by faith alone without works, but an effective internal
   justification in the etymological sense of the term. He was Protestant
   in this also, that he excluded human merit and represented faith which
   apprehends Christ, as the gift of God. In connection with this he held
   peculiar views on the image of God, which he made to consist in the
   essential union of the human nature with the divine nature, and on the
   necessity of the incarnation, which in his opinion would have taken
   place even without the fall, in order that through Christ's humanity we
   might become partakers of the essential righteousness of God. [520] He
   appealed to Luther, but denounced Melanchthon as a heretic and
   pestilential man.

   Osiander was protected by Duke Albrecht of Prussia, whom he had
   converted, but opposed from every quarter by Mörlin, Staphylus,
   Stancarus, Melanchthon, Amsdorf, Menius, Flacius, Chemnitz. Between the
   two parties stood the Swabian divines Brentius and Binder. The
   controversy was carried on with a good deal of misunderstanding, and
   with such violence that the Professors in Königsberg carried fire-arms
   into their academic sessions. It was seriously circulated and believed
   that the devil wrote Osiander's books, while he enjoyed his meals.

   After Osiander's death (1552), his son-in-law, John Funck, chaplain of
   the Duke, became the leader of his small party; but he was executed on
   the scaffold (1566) as a heretic and disturber of the public peace.
   Mörlin was recalled from exile and made Bishop of Samland. The Prussian
   collection of Confessions (Corpus Doctrinæ Pruthenicum, or Borussicum,
   Königsberg, 1567) condemned the doctrines of Osiander.

   In close connection with the Osiandric controversy on justification was
   the Stancarian dispute, introduced by Francesco Stancaro (or
   Stancarus), an Italian ex-priest, and for a short time Professor in
   Königsberg (d. 1574 in Poland). He asserted, against Osiander and in
   agreement with Peter the Lombard, that Christ was our Mediator and
   Redeemer according to his human nature only (since he, being God
   himself, could not mediate between God and God). [521] He called his
   opponents and all the Reformers ignoramuses. [522]

   Another collateral controversy, concerning the obedience of Christ, was
   raised, A.D. 1563, by Parsimonius, or Karg, a Lutheran minister in
   Bavaria. [523] He derived our redemption entirely from our Lord's
   passive obedience, and denied that his active obedience had any
   vicarious merit, since Christ himself, as man, owed active obedience to
   God. He also opposed the doctrine of imputation, and resolved
   justification into the idea of remission of sins.

   Karg was opposed by Ketzmann in Ansbach, by Heshusius, and the
   Wittenberg divines. Left without sympathy, and threatened with
   deposition and exile, he recanted his theses in 1570, and confessed
   that the obedience of Christ, his righteousness, merit, and innocence
   are the ground of our justification and our greatest comfort. [524]

   The 'Form of Concord' teaches that Christ as God and man in his one,
   whole, and perfect obedience, is our righteousness, and that his whole
   obedience unto death is imputed to us.

   IV. THE MAJORISTIC CONTROVERSY (1552-1577.) [525]

   It is closely connected with the Synergistic, Osiandric, and Antinomian
   controversies, and refers to the use of good works.

   The Reformers derived salvation solely from the merits of Christ
   through the medium of faith, as the organ of reception, in accordance
   with the Scripture, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
   be saved.' But faith was to them a work of God, a living apprehension
   of Christ, and the fruitful parent of good works. Luther calls faith a
   'lively, busy, mighty thing,' which can no more be separated from love
   than fire from heat and light. [526] Melanchthon, in his later period,
   laid greater stress on good works, and taught their necessity as fruits
   of faith, but not as a condition of salvation, which is a free,
   unmerited gift of God. [527]

   Georg Major (Professor at Wittenberg since 1539, died 1574), a pupil of
   Melanchthon, and one of the framers of the Leipzig Interim, declared
   during his sojourn at Eisleben (1552) that good works are necessary to
   salvation. [528] He pronounced the anathema on every one who taught
   otherwise, though he were an angel from heaven. He meant, however, the
   necessity of good works as a negative condition, not as a meritorious
   cause, and he made, moreover, a distinction between salvation and
   justification. [529]

   This proposition seemed to be inconsistent with Luther's solifidianism,
   and was all the more obnoxious for its resemblance to a clause in the
   Romanizing Leipzig Interim (1548). [530]

   Hence it was violently opposed from every direction. Nicolas von
   Amsdorf (1483-1565), appealing to St. Paul and Dr. Luther, condemned it
   as 'the worst and most pernicious heresy,' and boldly advocated even
   the counter-proposition, that good works are dangerous to salvation
   (1559). [531] Flacius denounced Major's view as popish, godless, and
   most dangerous, because it destroyed the sinner's comfort on the
   death-bed and the gallows, made the salvation of children impossible,
   confounded the gospel with the law, and weakened the power of Christ's
   death. [532] Wigand objected that the error of the necessity of good
   works was already condemned by the Apostles in Jerusalem (Acts xv.),
   that it was the pillar of popery and a mark of Antichrist, and that it
   led many dying persons unable to find good works in themselves, to
   despair. Justus Menius, Superintendent of Gotha, tried to mediate by
   asserting the necessity of good works for the preservation of faith;
   but this was decidedly rejected as indirectly amounting to the same
   error. A synod, held at Eisenach in 1556, decided in seven theses that
   Major's proposition was true only in abstracto and in foro legis, but
   not in foro evangelii, and should be avoided as liable to be
   misunderstood in a popish sense. Christ delivered us from the curse of
   the law, and faith alone is necessary both for justification and
   salvation, which are identical. [533] The theses were subscribed by
   Amsdorf, Strigel, Mörlin, Hugel, Stössel, and even by Menius (although
   the fifth was directed against him). But now there arose a controversy
   on the admission of the abstract and legal necessity of good works,
   which was defended by Flacius, Wigand, and Mörlin; opposed by Amsdorf
   and Aurifaber as semi-popish. The former view prevailed.

   Melanchthon felt that the necessity of good works for salvation might
   imply their meritoriousness, and hence proposed to drop the words for
   salvation, and to be contented with the assertion that good works are
   necessary because God commanded them, and man is bound to obey his
   Creator. [534] This middle course was adopted by the Wittenberg
   Professors and by the Diet of Princes at Frankfort (1558), but was
   rejected by the strict Lutherans.

   Major consented (in 1558) no longer to use his phrase, and revoked it
   in his last will (1570), but he was still assailed, and the Professors
   at Jena prayed for the conversion of the poor old man (1571) with
   little hope of success. Flacius prayed that Christ might crush also
   this serpent. Heshusius publicly confessed that he had committed a
   horrible sin in accepting the Doctor's degree from Major, who was a
   disgrace to the theological profession.

   The 'Form of Concord' settled the controversy by separating good works
   both from justification and salvation, yet declaring them necessary as
   effects of justifying faith. [535]

   V. THE ANTINOMIAN CONTROVERSY (1527-1560). [536]

   Protestantism in its joyful enthusiasm for the freedom and
   all-sufficiency of the gospel was strongly tempted to antinomianism,
   but restrained by its moral force and the holy character of the gospel
   itself. [537] Luther, in opposition to Romish legalism, put the gospel
   and the law as wide apart as 'heaven and earth,' and said,' Moses is
   dead.' [538] Nevertheless he embodied in his Catechism an excellent
   exposition of the Decalogue before the Creed; and Melanchthon, as we
   have already seen, laid more and more stress on the moral element and
   good works in opposition to the abuses of solifidianism and carnal
   security.

   The antinomian controversy has two stages. The first touches the office
   of the law under the gospel dispensation, and its relation to
   repentance; the second the necessity of good works, which was the point
   of dispute between Major and Amsdorf, and has already been discussed.

   John Agricola, of Eisleben, misunderstood Luther, as Marcion, the
   antinomian Gnostic, misunderstood St. Paul. [539] He first uttered
   antinomian principles in 1527, in opposition to Melanchthon, who in his
   Articles of Visitation urged the preaching of the law unto repentance.
   [540] He was appeased in a conference with the Reformers at Torgau
   (December, 1527). But when Professor at Wittenberg, he renewed the
   controversy in 1537, in some arrogant theses, and was defeated by
   Luther in six public disputations (1538 and 1540). He made a severe
   attack on Luther, which involved him in a lawsuit, but he removed to
   Berlin, and sent from there a recantation, Dec. 6, 1540. Long
   afterwards (1562) he reasserted his views in a published sermon on Luke
   vii. 37. He was neither clear nor consistent.

   Agricola taught with some truth that genuine repentance and remission
   of sin could only be secured under the gospel by the contemplation of
   Christ's love. In this Luther (and afterwards Calvin) agreed with him.
   But he went much further. The law in his opinion was superseded by the
   gospel, and has nothing to do with repentance and conversion. It works
   only wrath and death; it leads to unbelief and despair, not to the
   gospel. He thought the gospel was all-sufficient both for the office of
   terror and the office of comfort. Luther, on the contrary, maintained,
   in his disputations, that true repentance consists of two
   things--knowledge and sorrow of sin, and resolution to lead a better
   life. The first is produced by the law, the second by the gospel. The
   law alone would lead to despair and hatred of God; hence the gospel is
   added to appease and encourage the terrified conscience. The law can
   not justify, but must nevertheless be taught, that by it the impious
   may be led to a knowledge of their sin and be humbled, and that the
   pious may be admonished to crucify their flesh with its sinful lusts,
   and to guard against security.

   The 'Form of Concord' teaches a threefold use of the law: (a) A
   political or civil use in maintaining outward discipline and order; (b)
   An elenchtic or pedagogic use in leading men to a knowledge of sin and
   the need of redemption; (c) A didactic or normative use in regulating
   the life of the regenerate. The Old and New Testaments are not
   exclusively related as law and gospel, but the Old contains gospel, and
   the New is law and gospel complete.

   VI. THE CRYPTO-CALVINISTIC OR EUCHARISTIC CONTROVERSY (1549-1574).
   [541]

   The eucharistic controversy between Luther and Zwingli, although it
   alienated the German and Swiss branches of the Reformation, did not
   destroy all intercourse, nor discourage new attempts at reconciliation.
   Calvin's theory, which took a middle course, retaining, on the basis of
   Zwingli's exegesis, the religious substance of Luther's faith, and
   giving it a more intellectual and spiritual form, triumphed in
   Switzerland, gained much favor in Germany, and opened a fair prospect
   for union. But the controversy of Westphal against Calvin, and the
   subsequent overthrow of Melanchthonianism, completed and consolidated
   the separation of the two Confessions.

   Melanchthon's later view of the Lord's Supper, which essentially agreed
   with that of Calvin, was for a number of years entertained by the
   majority of Lutheran divines even at Wittenberg and Leipzig, and at the
   court of the Elector of Saxony. It was also in various ways officially
   recognized with the Augsburg Confession of 1540, which was long
   regarded as an improved rather than an altered edition.

   But the Princes and the people held fast to the heroic name of Luther
   against any rival authority, and when the alternative was presented to
   choose between him and Melanchthon or Calvin, the issue could not be
   doubtful. Besides, the old traditional view of the mysterious power and
   magical efficacy of the sacraments had a firm hold upon the minds and
   hearts of German Christians, as it has to this day.

   Joachim Westphal, a rigid Lutheran minister at Hamburg, renewed, in
   1552, the sacramental war in several tracts against the 'Zurich
   Consensus' (issued 1549), and against Calvin and Peter Martyr; aiming
   indirectly against the Philippists, and treating all as sacramentarians
   and heretics who denied the corporeal presence, the oral manducation,
   and the literal eating of Christ's body even by unbelievers. He made no
   distinction between Calvin and Zwingli, spoke of their godless
   perversion of the Scriptures, and even their satanic blasphemies. About
   the same time John à Lasco, a Polish nobleman and minister of a foreign
   Reformed congregation in London, and one hundred and seventy-five
   Protestants, who were driven from England under the bloody Mary (1553),
   sought and were refused in cold winter a temporary refuge in Denmark,
   Rostock, Lübeck, and Hamburg (though they found it at last in East
   Friesland). Westphal denounced them as martyrs of the devil, enraged
   the people against them, and gloried in this cruelty as an act of
   faith. [542]

   This intolerance roused the Swiss, who had kept silence for some time,
   to a defense of their doctrine. Calvin took up his sharp and racy pen,
   indignantly rebuking 'the no less rude and barbarous than sacrilegious
   insults' to persecuted members of Christ, and triumphantly vindicating,
   against misrepresentations and objections, his doctrine of the
   spiritual real presence of Christ, and the sealing communication of the
   life-giving virtue of his body in heaven to the believer through the
   power of the Holy Ghost. [543] He claimed to agree with the Augsburg
   Confession as understood and explained by its author, and appealed to
   him. Melanchthon, for reasons of prudence and timidity, declined to
   take an active part in the strife 'on bread-worship,' but never
   concealed his essential agreement with him. [544] His enemies
   re-published his former views. His followers were now stigmatized as
   'Crypto-Calvinists.'

   The controversy gradually spread over all Germany, and was conducted
   with an incredible amount of bigotry and superstition.

   In Bremen, John Timann fought for the real presence, and insisted upon
   the ubiquity of Christ's body as a settled dogma (1555), while Albert
   Hardenberg opposed it, and was banished (1560); but a reaction took
   place afterwards in favor of the Reformed Confession.

   In Heidelberg, Tilemann Heshusius, [545] General Superintendent since
   1558, attacked the Melanchthonian Klebitz openly at the altar by trying
   to wrest from him the cup. The Elector Frederick III. dismissed both
   (1559), ordered the preparation of the Heidelberg Catechism, and
   introduced the Reformed Confession in the Palatinate (1563).

   In Würtemberg the ubiquity doctrine triumphed (at a synod in Stuttgart,
   1559), chiefly through the influence of Brentius, who had formerly
   agreed with Melanchthon, but now feared that 'the devil intended
   through Calvinism to smuggle heathenism, Talmudism, and Mohammedanism
   into the Church.' [546] A colloquy at Maulbronn (1564) between the
   Würtemberg and the Palatinate divines on ubiquity led to no result.

   Ducal Saxony, under the lead of the Flacianist Professors of Jena, was
   violently arrayed against Electoral Saxony with the Crypto-Calvinist
   faculty at Wittenberg. The Elector Augustus, strongly prejudiced
   against Flacianism, deceived by the Consensus Dresdensis (1571), and
   controlled by his physician, Caspar Peucer, the active and influential
   lay-leader of the Crypto-Calvinists, unwittingly maintained for some
   time Calvinism under the disguise of sound Lutheranism. When he became
   Regent of the Thuringian Principalities (1573), he banished Heshusius
   and Wigand from Jena, and all the Flacianists of that district.

   Thus Philippism triumphed in all Saxony, but it was only for a short
   season.

   Elector Augustus was an enthusiastic admirer of Luther, and would not
   tolerate a drop of Calvinistic blood in his veins. When he found out
   the deceptive policy of the Crypto-Calvinists, he suppressed them by
   force, 1574. [547] The leaders were deposed, imprisoned, and exiled,
   among them four theological Professors at Wittenberg. [548] Peucer was
   confined in prison for twelve years, while his children were wandering
   about in misery. [549] Thanks were offered in all the churches of
   Saxony for the triumph of genuine Lutheranism. A memorial coin exhibits
   the Elector with the sword in one hand, and a balance in the other: one
   scale bearing the child Jesus; the other, high up, the four Wittenberg
   Philippists with the devil, and the title 'reason.'

   After the death of Augustus (1586), Calvinism again raised its head
   under Christian I. and the lead of Chancellor Nicolas Crell, but after
   another change of ruler (1591) it was finally overthrown: the
   protesting Professors in Wittenberg and Leipzig were deposed and
   exiled; the leading ministers at Dresden (Salmuth and Pierius) were
   imprisoned; Crell, who had offended the nobility, after suffering for
   ten years in prison, was, without an investigation, beheaded as a
   traitor to his country (Oct. 9, 1601), solemnly protesting his
   innocence, but forgiving his enemies. [550] Since that time the name of
   a Calvinist became more hateful in Saxony than that of a Jew or a
   Mohammedan.

   It is characteristic of the spirit of the age and the doctrine of
   consubstantiation that they gave rise to all sorts of idle, curious,
   and unwittingly irreverent speculations about the possible effect of
   the consecrated elements upon things for which they never were
   intended. The schoolmen of the Middle Ages, in the interest of
   transubstantiation, seriously disputed the question whether the eating
   of the eucharistic bread would kill or sanctify a mouse, or (as the
   wisest thought) have no effect at all, since the mouse did not receive
   it sacramentaliter, but only accidentaliter. Orthodox Lutherans of the
   sixteenth century went even further. Brentius decidedly favored the
   opinion that the consecrated bread, if eaten by a mouse, was fully as
   much the body of Christ as Christ was the Son of God in the mother's
   womb and on the back of an ass. The sacrament, he admitted, was not
   intended for animals, but neither was it intended for unbelievers, who
   nevertheless received the very body and blood of Christ. An eccentric
   minister in Rostock required the communicants to be shaved to prevent
   profanation. Licking the blood of Christ from the beard was supposed to
   be punished with instant death or a monstrous growth of the beard.
   Sarcerius caused the earth on which a drop of Christ's blood fell,
   instantly to be dug up and burned. At Hildesheim it was customary to
   cut off the beard or the piece of a garment which was profaned by a
   drop of wine; and the Superintendent, Kongius, was expelled from the
   city, simply because he had taken up from the earth a wafer and given
   it to a communicant, without first kneeling before it, kissing, and
   reconsecrating it, as his colleagues thought he should have done. The
   Lutherans in Ansbach disputed about the question whether the body of
   Christ were actually swallowed, like other food, and digested in the
   stomach. When the Rev. John Musculus, in Frankfort-on-the-Oder,
   inadvertently spilled a little wine at the communion, he was summoned
   before a Synod, and Elector John Joachim of Brandenburg declared that
   deposition, prison, and exile were too mild a punishment for such a
   crime, and that the offender, who had not spared the blood of Christ,
   must suffer bloody punishment, and have two or three fingers cut off.
   [551]

   There was also a considerable dispute among Lutheran divines about the
   precise time and duration of the corporeal presence. John Saliger
   (Beatus) of Lübeck and his friend Fredeland (followers of Flacius, and
   of his doctrine on original sin) maintained that the bread becomes the
   body of Christ immediately after the consecration and before the use
   (ante usum), and called those who denied it sacramentarians; while they
   in turn were charged with the Romish error of transubstantiation.
   Deposed at Lübeck, Saliger renewed the controversy from the pulpit at
   Rostock (1568). Chytræus decided that this was a question of idle
   curiosity rather than piety, and that it was sufficient to attach the
   blessing of the sacrament to the transaction, without time-splitting
   distinctions (1569). The usual Lutheran doctrine confines the union of
   the bread with the body to the time of the use, and hence the term
   consubstantiation was rejected, if thereby be understood a durabilis
   inclusio, or permanent conjunction of the sacramental bread and body of
   Christ. [552]

   VII. THE CHRISTOLOGICAL OR UBIQUITARIAN CONTROVERSY. [553]

   The Lutheran view of the Lord's Supper implies the ubiquity, i.e., the
   illocal omnipresence, or at all events the multipresence of Christ's
   body. And this again requires for its support the theory of the
   communicatio idiomatum, or the communication of the attributes of the
   two natures of Christ, whereby his human nature becomes a partaker of
   the omnipresence of his divine nature. A considerable amount of
   interesting speculation was spent on this subject in the sixteenth
   century.

   All Christians believe in the real and abiding omnipresence of Christ's
   divine nature, and of Christ's person (which resides in the divine
   nature or the pre-existing Logos), according to Matt. xxviii. 20;
   xviii. 20. But the omnipresence of his human nature was no article of
   any creed before the Reformation, and was only held by a few fathers
   and schoolmen of questionable orthodoxy, as a speculative opinion.
   [554] The prevailing doctrine was that Christ's glorified body, though
   no more grossly material and sensuous, and not exactly definable in its
   nature, was still a body, seated on a throne of majesty in heaven, to
   which it visibly ascended, and from which it will in like manner return
   to judge the quick and the dead. This was the view even of Gregory
   Nazianzen and John of Damascus, who otherwise approach very nearly the
   Lutheran dogma of the communicatio idiomatum (the genus majestaticum).
   The mediæval scholastics ascribed omnipresence only to the divine
   nature and the person of Christ, unipresence to his human nature in
   heaven, multipresence to his body in the sacrament; but they derived
   the eucharistic multipresence from the miracle of transubstantiation,
   and not from an inherent specific quality of the body. Even William
   Occam (who was inclined to consubstantiation rather than
   transubstantiation, and had considerable influence upon Luther)
   ventured only upon the paradox of the hypothetical possibility of an
   absolute ubiquity.

   Luther first clearly taught the absolute ubiquity of Christ's body, as
   a dogmatic support of the real presence in the eucharist. [555] He
   based it exegetically on Eph. i. 23 ('which is his body, the fullness
   of him that filleth all in all') and John iii. 13 ('the Son of man who
   is in heaven'), and derived it directly from the personal union of the
   divine and human natures in Christ (not, as his followers, from the
   communication of the attributes). He adopted the scholastic distinction
   of three kinds of presence: 1. Local or circumscriptive (material and
   confined--as water is in the cup); 2. Definitive (local, without local
   inclusion or measurable quantity--as the soul is in the body, Christ's
   body in the bread, or when it passed through the closed door); 3.
   Repletive (supernatural, divine omnipresence). He ascribed all these to
   Christ as man, so that in one and the same moment, when he instituted
   the holy communion, he was circumscriptive at the table, definitive in
   the bread and wine, and repletive in heaven, i.e., every where. [556]
   Where God is, there is Christ's humanity, and where Christ's humanity
   is, there is inseparably joined to it the whole Deity. In connection
   with this, Luther consistently denied the literal meaning of Christ's
   ascension to heaven, and understood the right hand of God, at which he
   sits, to be only a figurative term for the omnipresent power of God
   (Matt. xxviii. 18). [557] Here he resorted to a mode of interpretation
   which he so strongly condemned in Zwingli when applied to the word is.

   It is very plain that such an absolute omnipresence of the body proves
   much more than Luther intended or needed for his eucharistic theory;
   hence he made no further use of it in his later writings, and rested
   the real presence at last, as he did at first, exclusively on the
   literal (or rather synecdochical) interpretation of the words, 'This is
   my body.' His earlier Christology was much more natural, and left room
   for a real development of Christ's humanity.

   Melanchthon, in his later period, decidedly opposed the ubiquity of
   Christ's body, and the introduction of 'scholastic disputations' on
   this subject into the doctrine of the eucharist. He wished to know only
   of a personal presence of Christ, which does not necessarily involve
   bodily presence. [558] He also rejected the theory of the communicatio
   idiomatum in a real or physical sense, because it leads to a confusion
   of natures, and admitted with Calvin only a dialectic or verbal
   communication. [559] Luther's Christology leaned to the Eutychian
   confusion, Melanchthon's to the Nestorian separation of the two
   natures.

   The renewal of the eucharistic controversy by Westphal led to a fuller
   discussion of ubiquity. The orthodox Lutherans insisted upon ubiquity
   as a necessary result of the real communication of the properties of
   the two natures in Christ; while the Philippists and Calvinists
   rejected it as inconsistent with the nature of a body, with the
   realness of Christ's ascension, and with the general principle that the
   infinite can not be comprehended or shut up in the finite. [560]

   The Colloquy at Maulbronn.--These conflicting Christologies met face to
   face at a Colloquy in the cloister of Maulbronn, in the Duchy of
   Würtemberg, April 10-15, 1564. [561] It was arranged by Duke
   Christopher of Würtemberg and Elector Frederick III. of the Palatinate.
   Olevianus, Ursinus (the authors of the Heidelberg Catechism), and
   Boquin defended the Reformed, the Swabian divines, Andreæ, Brenz,
   Schnepf, Bidenbach, and Lucas Osiander the Lutheran view. Five days
   were devoted to the discussion of the subject of ubiquity, and one day
   to the interpretation of the words, 'This is my body.' The Lutherans
   regarded ubiquity as the main pillar of their view of the eucharistic
   presence. Andreæ proposed three points for the debate--the incarnation,
   the ascension, and the right hand of God.

   The Lutheran reasoning was chiefly dogmatic: The incarnation is the
   assumption of humanity into the possession of the divine fullness with
   all its attributes, and the right hand of God means his almighty and
   omnipresent power; from these premises the absolute ubiquity of
   Christ's body necessarily follows. [562]

   The Reformed based their argument chiefly on those Scripture passages
   which imply Christ's presence in a particular place, and his absence
   from other places, as when he says, 'I leave the world;' 'I go to
   prepare a place for you. . . . I will come again;' 'I have not yet
   ascended to my Father;' or when the angels say, 'He is not here,'
   'Jesus is taken up from you into heaven,' etc. (John xiv. 2-4, 28; xvi.
   3, 7, 16; xx. 17; Acts i. 11; iii. 21). [563] They urged the difference
   between the divine and human, and between the state of humiliation and
   the state of exaltation. In the appeal to the fathers and the Creed of
   Chalcedon they had also decidedly the advantage. Nevertheless, the
   Colloquy had no other effect than to confirm the two parties in their
   opinions. [564]

   The Consensus Dresdensis.--The Wittenberg and Leipzig Professors and
   other Philippists in Saxony openly rejected ubiquity in the Consensus
   Dresdensis (October, 1571), which satisfied even the Elector Augustus.
   This document teaches that the human nature of Christ was after the
   resurrection glorified and transfigured, but not deified, and still
   remains human nature with its essential properties, flesh of our flesh;
   that the ascension of Christ must be understood literally, and not as a
   mere spectacle; that Christ's sitting at the right hand means the
   elevation of both natures to the priestly and kingly office; that the
   sacramental presence of the body of Christ must be something special
   and altogether distinct from omnipresence. [565]

   Absolute and Relative Ubiquity. Brenz and Chemnitz.--There was a very
   material difference among the advocates of ubiquity themselves as to
   its nature and extent, viz.: whether it were absolute, or relative,
   that is to say, an omnipresence in the strict sense of the term, or
   merely a multipresence depending on the will of Christ (hence also
   called volipræsentia, or, by combination, multivolipræsentia). The
   Swabians, under the lead of Brenz and Andreæ, held the former; the
   Saxon divines, under the lead of Chemnitz, the latter view.

   John Brenz, or Brentius (1499-1570), the Reformer of the Duchy of
   Würtemberg, and after Melanchthon's death the most prominent German
   divine, developed, since 1559, with considerable speculative talent, a
   peculiar Christology. [566] It rests on the Chalcedonian distinction
   between two natures and one person, but implies at the same time, as he
   felt himself, a considerable departure from it, since he carried the
   theanthropic perfection of the exalted Saviour to the very beginning of
   his earthly life. He took up Luther's idea of ubiquity, and developed
   it to its legitimate consequences in the interest of the eucharistic
   presence. According to his system, the incarnation is not only a
   condescension of the eternal Logos to a personal union with human
   nature, but at the same time a deification of human nature, or an
   infusion of the divine substance and fullness into the humanity of
   Christ at the first moment of its existence. Consequently the man Jesus
   of Nazareth was omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent in the Virgin's
   womb, in the manger, and on the cross, as well as he is now in the
   state of glory. [567] The only difference is, that these divine
   attributes were concealed during his earthly life, and were publicly
   revealed to his disciples at the ascension to the right hand of God,
   i.e., to the omnipotent and omnipresent power of God. [568] The states
   of humiliation and exaltation are not successive states, but co-existed
   during the earthly life of Christ. While Christ's humanity was poor,
   weak, suffering, and dying on earth, it was simultaneously almighty and
   omnipresent in heaven. He ascended in his humanity invisibly to heaven
   even at his incarnation, and remained there (John iii. 13). The visible
   ascension from Mount Olivet would have been impossible without the
   preceding invisible exaltation. Heaven is no particular place, but a
   state of entire freedom from space, or absolute existence in God. Space
   and time, with their limitations, belong only to the earthly mode of
   existence. Wherever the divinity is, there is also Christ's humanity,
   [569] i.e., every where, not, indeed, in the way of local extension and
   diffusion, but in a celestial, supernatural manner, by virtue of the
   hypostatic union and the real communication of the properties of the
   divine nature to the human.

   This is the most consistent, though also the most objectionable form of
   the ubiquity dogma. It virtually resolves the earthly life of Christ
   into a Gnostic delusion, or establishes a double humanity of
   Christ--one visible and real, and the other invisible and fantastic.
   [570]

   Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586), the chief author of the 'Formula of
   Concord,' next to Andreæ, less original and speculative than Brenz, but
   superior in patristic learning and sound judgment, elaborated a
   Christology which mediates between Luther and Melanchthon, and taught
   only a relative or restricted ubiquity, i.e., a multipresence, which
   depends upon the will of Christ. [571] He was followed by Selnecker,
   Chytræus, and most of the Saxon divines. He opposes the Swabian
   doctrine of a physical, natural communication and transfusion of
   idiomata, and of the capacity of the finite for the infinite, except in
   the sense that God may dwell and reveal himself in man. He calls the
   absolute ubiquity a monstrosity (monstrum, portentum), as Selnecker
   called it a Satanic fiction (figmentum Satanæ). Christ is an incarnate
   God, not a deified man. But the Logos may temporarily communicate a
   divine attribute to the human nature in a supernatural manner as a
   donum superadditum, without thereby setting aside the abiding
   limitations of humanity; just as fire may give heat and brightness to
   iron without turning the iron into fire. Chemnitz agrees with the
   Reformed, as he expressly says, in adopting the 'simple, literal, and
   natural signification' of the ascension of Christ as related by the
   Evangelists, i.e., that 'he was, by a visible motion, lifted up on high
   in a circumscribed form and location of the body, and departed further
   and further from the presence of the Apostles,' and is, consequently,
   in this sense withdrawn from us who are on earth, until he shall in
   like manner 'descend from heaven in glory in a visible and
   circumscribed form.' Even in glory Christ's body is finite and
   somewhere (alicubi). Nevertheless, while seated at the right hand of
   God, he may be present where he chooses to be, and he is present where
   his Word expressly indicates such presence; as in the eucharist
   (according to the literal interpretation of the words of institution),
   or when he appeared to dying Stephen, or to Paul on the way to
   Damascus. [572]

   Chemnitz escaped some difficulties of the Swabian theory, but by
   endeavoring to mediate between it and the Melanchthonian and Swiss
   theory, he incurred the objections to both. Christ's glorified body is
   indeed not confined to any locality, and may be conceived to move with
   lightning speed from place to place, but its simultaneous presence in
   many places, wherever the eucharist is celebrated, involves the chief
   difficulty of an omnipresence, and is just as inconsistent with the
   nature of a body.

   Of subordinate interest was the incidental question, disputed mainly
   between Wigand and Heshusius, whether the flesh of Christ were almighty
   and adorable only in concreto, or also in abstracto (extra, personam).
   Chemnitz declared this to be a mere logomachy, and advised the
   combatants to stop it, but in vain.

   The first creed which adopted the ubiquity dogma was the Würtemberg
   Confession drawn up by Brenz, and adopted by a Synod at Stuttgart, Dec.
   19, 1559. [573]

   The Formula Concordiæ on this subject is a compromise between the
   Swabian absolute ubiquitarianism represented by Andreæ and expressed in
   the Epitome, and the Saxon hypothetical ubiquitarianism represented by
   Chemnitz and expressed in the Solida Declaratio. The compromise
   satisfied neither party. The Helmstädt divines--Tilemann Heshusius,
   Daniel Hoffmann, and Basilius Sattler--who had signed the written
   Formula in 1577, refused to sign the printed copy in 1580, because it
   contained unauthorized concessions to the Swabian view. A colloquy was
   held in Quedlinburg, 1583, at which the ubiquity question was discussed
   for several days without result. [574] Chemnitz was in a difficult
   position, as he nearly agreed with the Helmstädtians, and conceded that
   certain expressions had been wrested from him, but he signed the
   Formula for the sake of peace, with the reservation that he understood
   it in the sense of a hypothetical or limited ubiquity.

   The Giessen and Tübingen Controversy about the Kenosis and Krypsis.
   [575] --The ubiquity question was revived under a new shape, on the
   common basis of the 'Formula of Concord' and the dogma of the
   communicatio idiomatum, in the controversy between the Kenoticism, of
   the theologians of Giessen, which followed in the track of Chemnitz,
   and the Krypticism of the theologians of Tübingen, which was based upon
   the theory of Brenz and Andreæ. The controversy forms the last phase in
   the development of the orthodox Lutheran Christology; it continued from
   1616-1625, and was lost in the Thirty-Years' War.

   Both parties agreed that the human nature of Christ from the moment of
   the incarnation, even in the mother's womb and on the cross, was in
   full possession (ktesis) of the divine attributes of omnipresence,
   omnipotence, omniscience, etc.; but they differed as to their use
   (chresis). The Giessen divines--Balthazar Mentzer (d. 1627), his
   son-in-law, Justus Feuerborn (d. 1656), and John Winckelmann--taught a
   real self-renunciation (kenosis, evacuatio, exinanitio), [576] i.e.,
   that Christ voluntarily laid aside the actual use of the divine
   attributes and functions, except in the working of miracles; while the
   Tübingen divines--Lucas Osiander II. (d. 1638), Theodor Thumm, or
   Thummius (d. 1630), and Melchior Nicolai (d. 1659)--taught that he made
   a secret use of them (krupsis, occulta usurpatio). [577]

   The Giessen divines, wishing chiefly to avoid the reproach of a
   portentosa ubiquitas, represented the omnipresence of Christ's
   humanity, not as an all-pervading existence, [578] but as an
   all-controlling power, or as an element of omnipotence. [579] The
   Tübingen school taught, in consequence of the unio hypostatica, an
   absolute omnipresence of Christ's humanity, as a quiescent quality,
   which consists in filling all the spaces of the universe, even from the
   conception to the death on the cross. [580]

   A theological commission at Dresden, with Hoe von Hoenegg at the head,
   decided substantially in favor of the Giessen theory (1525), and
   against the Tübingen doceticism, without, however, advancing the
   solution of the problem or feeling its real difficulty.

   The Giessen theory is more consistent with the realness of Christ's
   human life, but less consistent with itself, since it admits an
   occasional interruption of it by the use of the inherent powers of the
   divinity; the Tübingen theory, on the other hand, virtually destroys
   the distinction between the state of humiliation and the state of
   exaltation, and resolves the life of Christ into a magical illusion.

   The modern Tübingen school of Baur and Strauss forms a strange parallel
   and contrast to that of the seventeenth century: it starts from the
   same principle that 'the finite is capable of the infinite,' but
   extends it pantheistically to humanity at large, and denies its
   applicability to Christ, on the ground that the divine fullness can not
   be emptied into a single individual. [581] Therefore, while the old
   Tübingen school in effect, though not in intention, destroys the real
   humanity of Christ, the modern Tübingen school consistently denies his
   divinity, and resolves all the supernatural and miraculous elements of
   the gospel history into a mythic poem or fiction.

   In the modern revival of orthodox Lutheranism, the ubiquity of the body
   of Christ is either avoided, or advocated only in the hypothetical
   form, and mostly with a leaning towards a more literal acceptation of
   the kenosis (Phil. ii. 7) than the Giessen divines contended for. [582]

   VIII. THE HADES CONTROVERSY. [583]

   This controversy, which is discussed in the ninth article of the
   'Formula of Concord,' referred to the time, manner, extent, and aim of
   Christ's mysterious descent into the world of departed spirits. It
   implied the questions whether the descent took place before or after
   the death on the cross; whether it were confined to the divine nature,
   or to the soul, or extended to the body; whether it belonged to the
   state of humiliation, or to the state of exaltation; whether it were a
   continuation of suffering and a tasting of the second death, or a
   triumph over hell. The answer to these questions depended in part on
   the different views of the communication of idiomata and the ubiquity
   of the body, as also on Hades, or Sheol, itself, which some identified
   with hell proper (Gehenna), while others more correctly understood it
   in a wider sense of the whole realm of the dead. Luther himself had at
   different times very different opinions of the descent, but regarded it
   chiefly as a victory over the kingdom of Satan.

   John Æpinus, [584] a Lutheran minister in Hamburg, started the
   controversy. He taught, first in 1544 and afterwards more fully, that
   Christ descended with his spirit into the region of the lost, in order
   to suffer the pains of hell for men, and thus to complete his
   humiliation or the work of redemption. So he explained Psalm xvi. 10
   (comp. Acts ii. 27, 31). Luther himself had at one time (1524) given a
   similar exposition of this passage. Flacius sided with Æpinus. But this
   theory was more Reformed than Lutheran, and was opposed by his
   colleagues, who carried the dispute into the pulpit and excited the
   people. Matsberger in Augsburg represented the descent, according to
   the usual view, as a local change, but had to suffer three years'
   imprisonment for it. Brenz condemned such locomotion as inconsistent
   with the dignity and ubiquity of Christ, and denied the locality of
   hell as well as of heaven. This accords with his view of the ascension.
   Melanchthon, being appealed to by the magistrate of Hamburg, answered
   with caution, and warned against preaching on subjects not clearly
   revealed. He referred to a sermon of Luther, preached at Torgau, 1533,
   in which he graphically describes the descent as a triumphant march of
   Christ through the dismayed infernal hosts, so that no believer need
   hereafter be afraid of the devil and damnation. Melanchthon thought
   this view was more probable than that of Æpinus; at all events, Christ
   manifested himself as a conqueror in hell, destroyed the power of the
   devil, raised many dead to life (Matt. xxvii. 53), and proclaimed to
   them the true doctrine of the Messiah; to ask more is unnecessary. He
   advised the magistrate to exclude the controversy from the pulpit.
   [585] Several of the most violent opponents of Æpinus were deposed and
   expelled. The dispute was lost in more serious controversies. It was
   almost confined to Hamburg.

   The Formula of Concord sanctioned substantially the view of Luther and
   Melanchthon, without entering into the minor questions.

   IX. THE ADIAPHORISTIC (OR INTERIMISTIC) CONTROVERSY (1548-1555). [586]

   This controversy is the subject of the tenth article of the 'Formula of
   Concord,' but was the first in the order of time among the disputes
   which occasioned this symbol. It arose, soon after Luther's death, out
   of the unfortunate Smalcald war, which resulted in the defeat of the
   Lutheran states, and brought them for a time under the ecclesiastical
   control of the Emperor Charles V. and his Romish advisers.

   Ecclesiastical rites and ceremonies, which are neither commanded nor
   forbidden in the Word of God, are in themselves indifferent (adiaphora,
   media, res mediæ, Mitteldinge), but the observance or non-observance of
   them may, under testing circumstances, become a matter of principle and
   of conscience. The Augsburg Confession and Apology (Art. VII.) declare
   that agreement in doctrine and the administration of the sacraments is
   sufficient for the unity of the Church, and may co-exist with diversity
   in usages and rites of human origin. Luther himself desired to retain
   many forms of the Catholic worship which he considered innocent and
   beautiful, provided only that no merit be attached to them and no
   burden be imposed upon the conscience. [587] But there is a great
   difference between retaining old forms and restoring them after they
   have been abolished, as also between a voluntary and a compulsory
   observance. When circumcision was yet lawful and practiced by Jewish
   Christians, Paul resisted it, and saved the principle of Christian
   liberty against the Judaizing error which made circumcision a condition
   of salvation. Some of the Romish ceremonies, moreover, especially those
   connected with the canon of the mass, involve doctrine, and affect the
   whole idea of Christian worship.

   When the Emperor, with the aid of the treasonable Elector Maurice of
   Saxony, had broken up the Lutheran League of Smalcald, he required the
   Protestants to submit to a doctrinal and ceremonial compromise till the
   final settlement of the religious controversy by an oecumenical
   Council.

   The first compromise was the so-called Augsburg Interim, enacted by the
   Diet of Augsburg (May, 1548) for the whole empire. It was essentially
   Romish, and yielded to the Protestants only the marriage of priests and
   the cup of the laity. It was rigidly executed in the Southern and
   prevailingly Roman Catholic states, where about four hundred Lutheran
   preachers were expelled or dismissed for non-conformity.

   The second compromise, called the Leipzig Interim, was enacted by the
   Elector Maurice (December, 1548), with the aid of Melanchthon and other
   leading Lutheran divines, for his Protestant dominion, where the
   Augsburg Interim could not be carried out. It was much milder, saved
   the evangelical creed in its essential features--as justification by
   the sole merits of Christ through a living faith--but required
   conformity to the Romish ritual, including confirmation, episcopal
   ordination, extreme unction, and even the greater part of the canon of
   the mass, and such ceremonies as fasts, processions, and the use of
   images in churches. [588]

   The Protestants were forced to the alternative of either submitting to
   one of these temporary compromises, or risking the fate of martyrs.

   Melanchthon, in the desire to protect churches from plunder and
   ministers from exile, and in the hope of saving the cause of the
   Reformation for better times, yet not without blamable weakness, gave
   his sanction to the Leipzig Interim, and undertook to act as a mediator
   between the Emperor, or his Protestant ally Maurice, and the Protestant
   conscience. [589] It was the greatest mistake in his life, yet not
   without plausible excuses and incidental advantages. He advocated
   immovable steadfastness in doctrine, but submission in every thing else
   for the sake of peace. He had the satisfaction that the University of
   Wittenberg, after temporary suspension, was restored, and soon
   frequented again by two thousand students; that no serious attempt was
   made to introduce the Interim there, and that matters remained pretty
   much as before. But outside of Wittenberg and Saxony his conduct
   appeared treasonable to the cause of the Reformation, and acted as an
   encouragement to an unscrupulous and uncompromising enemy. Hence the
   venerable man was fiercely assailed from every quarter by friend and
   foe. He afterwards frankly and honorably confessed that he had gone too
   far in this matter, and ought to have kept aloof from the insidious
   counsels of politicians. [590] He fully recovered his manhood in the
   noble Saxon Confession which he prepared in 1551 for the Council of
   Trent, and which is not merely a repetition of the Augsburg Confession,
   but also a refutation of the theology, worship, and government of the
   papal Church.

   Flacius chose the second alternative. Escaping from Wittenberg to the
   free city of Magdeburg, he opened from this stronghold of rigid
   Lutheranism, with other 'exiles of Christ,' a fierce and effective war
   against Melanchthon and the 'dangerous rabble of the Adiaphorists.' He
   charged his teacher and benefactor with superfluous mildness, weakness,
   want of faith, treason to truth; and characterized the Leipzig Interim
   as an undisguised 'union of Christ and Belial, of light and darkness,
   of sheep and wolf, of Christ and Antichrist,' aiming at the
   'reinstatement of popery and Antichrist in the temple of God.' [591]
   His chief text was 1 Cor. x. 20-23. He had upon the whole the best of
   the argument, although in form he violated all the laws of courtesy and
   charity, and continued, even long afterwards, to persecute Melanchthon
   as an abettor of Antichrist.

   In a milder tone the best friends of Melanchthon remonstrated with him.
   Brenz preferred exile and misery to the Interim, which he called
   interitus. Bucer of Strasburg did the same, and accepted a call to
   England. Calvin on this question sided with the anti-Adiaphorists, and
   wrote a letter to Melanchthon (June 18, 1550), which is a model of
   brotherly frankness and reproof. 'My present grief,' he says in
   substance, 'renders me almost speechless. . . . In openly admonishing
   you, I am discharging the duty of a true friend; and if I employ a
   little more severity than usual, do not think it is owing to any
   diminution of my old affection and esteem for you. . . . I know you
   love nothing better than open candor. I am truly anxious to approve all
   your actions, both to myself and to others. But at present I accuse you
   before yourself, that I may not be forced to join those who condemn you
   in your absence. This is the sum of your defense: That provided purity
   of doctrine be retained, externals should not be pertinaciously
   contended for. . . . But you extend the adiaphora too far. . . . Some
   of them contradict the Word of God. . . . When we are in the thick of
   the fight, we must fight all the more manfully; the hesitation of the
   general brings more disgrace than the flight of a whole herd of common
   soldiers. All will blame you if you do not set the example of
   unflinching steadfastness. . . . I had rather die with you a hundred
   times than see you survive the doctrines surrendered by you. I have no
   fear for the truth of God, nor do I distrust your steadfastness. . .
   Pardon me, dear Philip, for loading your breast with these groans. May
   the Lord continue to guide you by his Spirit and sustain you by his
   might.' [592]

   The defeat of the Emperor by Elector Maurice, who now turned against
   him, as he had turned before against his fellow-Protestants, and the
   consequent Peace of Augsburg, 1555, made an end to the Interim
   troubles, and secured freedom to the Lutheran Churches. But among
   theologians the controversy continued till the death of Melanchthon.

   The conduct of Melanchthon weakened his authority and influence, which
   had been rising higher and higher before and after Luther's death,
   especially in the University of Wittenberg. Before this unfortunate
   controversy he was universally regarded as the theological head of the
   evangelical Church in Germany, but now a large number of Lutherans
   began to look upon him with distrust.

   X. THE STRASBURG CONTROVERSY ON PREDESTINATION BETWEEN ZANCHI AND
   MARBACH (1561-1563). [593]

   This is the last specific doctrine discussed in the Formula of Concord
   (Art. XI.). The German and Swiss Reformers alike renewed, as an
   impregnable fortress in their war against the Pelagian corruptions of
   Rome, the Augustinian system, with its two closely connected doctrines
   of the absolute spiritual slavery or inability of the unregenerate will
   of man, and the absolute predestination of God; though with the
   characteristic difference that Luther and Melanchthon emphasized the
   servum arbitrium, Zwingli the providentia, Calvin the prædestinatio. In
   other words, the German Reformers started from the anthropological
   premise, and inferred from it the theological conclusion; while Calvin
   made the absolute sovereignty of God the cornerstone of his system.
   Luther firmly adhered to the servum arbitrium, but was more cautious,
   in his later years, on the mystery of the prædestinatio. [594]
   Melanchthon gave up both for his synergism and the universality of
   grace, though he continued in friendly correspondence with Calvin, who
   on his part put the mildest construction on this departure. The rigid
   Lutherans all retained Luther's view of total depravity in opposition
   to synergism, and some of them (namely, Amsdorf, Flacius, Brenz,
   Wigand, and, for a time, Heshusius) were also strict predestinarians.
   [595] But the prevailing Lutheran sentiment became gradually averse to
   a particular predestination, all the more since it was a prominent
   doctrine of the hated Calvinists. The Formula of Concord sanctioned a
   compromise between Augustinianism and universalism, or between the
   original Luther and the later Melanchthon, by teaching both the
   absolute inability of man and the universality of divine grace, without
   an attempt to solve these contradictory positions. In regard to the
   slavery of the human will, the Formula of Concord, following Luther,
   went even further than Calvin, and compared the natural man with a dead
   statue, or clod, and stone; while Calvin always (so far agreeing with
   the later Melanchthon) insisted on the spontaneity and responsibility
   of the will in sinning, and in accepting or rejecting the grace of God.

   The discussion of this subject was opened by the fierce polemic
   Tilemann Heshusius, who, in his defense of the corporeal presence
   against the Sacramentarians (Jena, 1560), first attacked also Calvin's
   doctrine of predestination, as Stoic and fatalistic, although a year
   afterwards, in opposition to synergism, he returned to his former view
   of an absolute and particular predestination. Beza answered his attack
   with superior ability. [596]

   Of more importance was the controversy between Marbach (a friend of
   Heshusius) and Zanchi within the Lutheran denomination itself. It
   decided its position on the question of predestination and
   perseverance.

   The Church of Strasburg had received from its reformer, Martin Bucer
   (who on account of the Interim followed a call to the University of
   Cambridge, 1549, and died there, 1551), a unionistic type, and acted as
   mediator between the Swiss and German churches. The Reformed
   Tetrapolitan Confession, the Lutheran Augsburg Confession, and the
   Wittenberg Concordia (a compromise between the Lutheran and Zwinglian
   views on the eucharist), were held in great esteem. Calvin and Peter
   Martyr, who preached and taught there, made a deep impression. The
   celebrated historian Sleidanus, and the learned founder and rector of
   the academy, John Sturm, labored in the same spirit.

   Jerome Zanchi (Zanchius, 1516-1590), a converted Italian, and pupil of
   Peter Martyr, became his successor as Professor of Theology at
   Strasburg in 1553. He was one of the most learned Calvinistic divines
   of the age, and labored for some time with great acceptance. He taught
   that in the eucharist Christ's true body broken for us, and his blood
   shed for us, are received in the sacrament, but not with the mouth and
   teeth, but by faith, and consequently only by believers. This was
   approved by his superiors, since the communion was not a cibus ventris
   sed mentis, and the same view had been taught by Bucer, Capito, Hedio,
   Zell, and Martyr. He opposed ubiquity, and the use of images in
   churches. He taught unconditional predestination, and its consequence,
   the perseverance of saints, in full harmony, as he believed, with
   Augustine, Luther, and Bucer. He reduced his ideas to four sentences:
   1. The elect receive from God the gift of true saving faith only once;
   2. Faith once received can never be totally and finally lost, partly on
   account of God's promise, partly on account of Christ's intercession;
   3. In every elect believer there are two men, the external and the
   internal--if he sin, he sins according to the external, but against the
   internal man, consequently he sins not with the whole heart and will;
   4. When Peter denied Christ, the confession of Christ died in his
   mouth, but not his faith in his heart.

   Several years before Zanchi's call to Strasburg, a Lutheran
   counter-current had been set in motion, which ultimately prevailed. It
   was controlled by John Marbach (1521-1581), a little man with a large
   beard, incessant activity, intolerant and domineering spirit, who had
   been called from Jena to the pulpit of Strasburg (1545). Inferior in
   learning, [597] he was superior to Zanchi in executive ability and
   popular eloquence. He delighted to be called Superintendent, and used
   his authority to the best advantage. He abolished Bucer's Catechism and
   introduced Luther's, taught the ubiquity of Christ's body, undermined
   the authority of the Tetrapolitan Confession, crippled the church of
   French refugees, to which Calvin had once ministered, weakened
   discipline, introduced pictures into churches, including those of
   Luther, and began to republish at Strasburg the fierce polemical book
   of Heshusius on the eucharist. This brought on the controversy.

   Zanchi persuaded the magistrate to suppress the publication of this
   book, because of its gross abuse of Melanchthon and a noble German
   Prince, the Elector Frederick III. of the Palatinate, and because it
   denounced all who differed from his views of the corporeal presence as
   heretics. From this time Marbach refused to greet Zanchi on the street,
   and gathered from the notes of his students material for accusation
   that he taught doctrines contrary to the Augsburg Confession. He
   objected, however, not so much to predestination itself as to Zanchi's
   method of teaching it a priori rather than a posteriori.

   The controversy lasted over two years. Zanchi visited and consulted
   foreign churches and universities. The answers differed not so much on
   predestination as on perseverance. [598]

   The theologians of Marburg (Hyperius, Lonicer, Garnier, Orth, Roding,
   Pincier, and Pistorius), Zurich (Bullinger, Martyr, Gualter, Lavater,
   Simler, Haller, Zwingli Jr.), and Heidelberg (Boquinus, Tremellius,
   Olevianus, and Diller) decided in favor of the theses of Zanchi. The
   ministers of Basel counseled peace and compromise; the divines of
   Tübingen approved of the doctrine of predestination, but dissented from
   the theses on perseverance; even Brenz thought the matter might be
   amicably settled. The divines of Saxony decided according to their
   different attitudes towards Melanchthon: the Melanchthonians liked
   Zanchi's doctrine of the eucharist, but disliked his view of
   predestination; the anti-Melanchthonians hated the former, but were
   favorable to the latter, because it was so strongly taught by Luther
   himself (De servo arbitrio).

   At last the 'Strasburg Formula of Concord' was adopted (1563), which
   prescribed the Wittenberg Concordia of 1536 as the rule of doctrine on
   the Lord's Supper, and asserted the possibility of the loss of faith,
   yet without denying predestination. [599] Calvin judged that it only
   threw a veil over the truth. Predestination was with Calvin and Luther
   an independent and central dogma; the later Lutherans assigned it a
   subordinate and subsidiary position, and denied its logical
   consequence, the perseverance of saints. This was also the position of
   Marbach.

   Zanchi subscribed the Strasburg Formula with a restriction, but for the
   sake of peace he soon followed a call to a Reformed Italian church at
   Chiavenna, and, being driven away by a pestilence to a mountain, he
   wrote a full account of the Strasburg troubles. [600] He was supported
   in his position by the worthy Sturm and several professors, but had the
   disadvantage of being a foreigner unacquainted with the German tongue.
   The pastors, backed by the people, triumphed over the professors. What
   Marbach had begun, his pupil Pappus completed. Strasburg was thoroughly
   Lutheranized, the Tetrapolitan Confession formally abolished as
   'Zwinglian,' and the Formula Concordiæ introduced (1597). [601]

   Yet, after all, the spirit of Bucer never died out. From Strasburg
   proceeded Spener, with his blessed revival of practical piety and a
   better appreciation of the Reformed Confession; [602] and from the
   theological faculty of Strasburg hail more recently the appreciating
   biographies of Beza, Bucer, and Capito (by Baum), and Melanchthon (by
   Carl Schmidt), and the best edition of the works of Calvin (by Baum,
   Cunitz, and Reuss). Thus history slowly but surely rectifies its own
   mistakes.

   THE PREPARATION OF THE FORMULA OF CONCORD. [603]

   These controversies turned the Lutheran churches in Germany into a camp
   of civil war, exposed them to the ridicule and obloquy of the Papists,
   and threatened to end in utter confusion and dissolution. The danger
   was increased by the endless territorial divisions of Germany, where
   every Prince and magistrate acted a little pope, and 'every fox looked
   to his own pelt.' [604]

   The best men in the Lutheran communion deeply deplored this state of
   things, and labored for peace and harmony. Augustus, Elector of Saxony
   (1533--1588), a pious and orthodox, though despotic Prince, controlled
   the political part, and paid the heavy expenses of the movement. [605]
   Jacob Andreæ, Professor of Theology and Chancellor of the University at
   Tübingen (1528-1590), a pupil and friend of Brentius, a man of rare
   energy, learning, eloquence, and diplomatic skill, managed the
   theological negotiations, made no less than one hundred and twenty-six
   journeys, and sacrificed the comforts of home and family (he had twelve
   children) to the pacification of the Lutheran Church. [606] Next to
   him, and at a later period, Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586), the greatest
   pupil of Melanchthon and the prince among the Lutheran divines of his
   age, [607] and Nicholas Selnecker (1530-1592), [608] originally
   likewise a Melanchthonian, took the most important part in the
   movement, and formed with Andreæ the theological 'triumvirate,' which
   finally completed the Form of Concord. [609]

   The first attempts at union were made at the conferences in Frankfort,
   1558; Naumburg, 1561; Altenburg, 1568; Wittenberg, 1569; Zerbst, 1570;
   Dresden, 1571; but they utterly failed and increased the dissension.

   After the violent suppression of Crypto-Calvinism in Electoral Saxony
   (1574), and the death of Flacius (1575) and some other untractable
   extremists, the work was resumed by the Elector and other Princes.
   Theological conferences were again held at Maulbronn (1575),
   Lichtenberg (1576), and Torgau (1576). Three forms of agreement were
   prepared, which, though not satisfactory, served as a basis for the
   Formula of Concord. The first is the Swabian and Saxon Formula, written
   by Andreæ (1574), and revised by Chemnitz and Chytræus (1575).' [610]
   The second is the Maulbronn Formula, prepared by the Swabian divines
   Lucas Osiander and Balthasar Bidembach (Nov. 14, 1575), and approved by
   a convent of Lutheran Princes in the Cloister of Maulbronn (Jan. 19,
   1576). [611] The former was found too lengthy, the latter too brief.
   Hence on the basis of both a third form was prepared which combined
   their merits, but omitted the honorable mention of the name of
   Melanchthon. This is the 'Torgau Book,' consisting of twelve articles.
   [612] It was mainly the work of Andreæ and Chemnitz, and completed by a
   convention of eighteen Lutheran divines at the Castle of Hartenfels, at
   Torgau, June 7, 1576. It was sent by the Elector Augustus to all the
   Lutheran Princes for examination and revision. It was closely
   scrutinized by twenty conventions of theologians held within three
   months, and elicited twenty-five vota, mostly favorable; even Heshusius
   and Wigand, the oracles of orthodoxy, were pleased, except that they
   wished an express condemnation of Melanchthon and other 'authors and
   patrons of corruptions.'

   At last the present Formula of Concord was completed, on the basis of
   the Torgau Book, by six learned divines--Andreæ (of Tübingen), Chemnitz
   (of Brunswick), Selnecker (of Leipzig), Musculus (of
   Frankfort-on-the-Oder), Cornerus, or Körner (also of Frankfort), and
   Chytræus (of Rostock)--who met in March and May, 1577, in the Cloister
   of Bergen, near Magdeburg, by order of the Elector of Saxony. Hence it
   is also called 'The Bergen Formula.' [613] The Preface was written two
   years later by the same authors, in the name of the Lutheran Princes,
   in two conventions at Jüterbock, January and June, 1579. Three years
   elapsed before the new symbolical book was signed and solemnly
   published, by order of Augustus, at Dresden, June 25, 1580, the
   fiftieth anniversary of the Augsburg Confession, together with the
   other Lutheran symbols, in one volume, called the 'Book of Concord,'
   which superseded all similar collections. [614] The Elector Augustus
   celebrated the completion of the work, which cost him so much trouble
   and money, by a memorial coin representing him in full armor on the
   storm-tossed ship of the church. [615]

   The Formula of Concord, like the three preparatory drafts on which it
   is based, was first composed in the German language, and published,
   with the whole Book of Concord, at Dresden, 1580. The Latin text was
   imperfectly prepared by Lucas Osiander, and appeared in the Latin
   Concordia, at Leipzig, 1580; then it was materially improved by
   Selnecker for his separate German-Latin edition of the Formula (not the
   Book) of Concord, Leipzig, 1582; and was again revised by a convent of
   Lutheran divines at Quedlinburg, 1583, under the direction of Martin
   Chemnitz. In this last revision it was published in the first authentic
   Latin edition of the Book of Concord, Leipzig, 1584, and has been
   recognized ever since as the received Latin text. It was also
   translated into the Dutch, Swedish, and English languages, but seldom
   separately published. [616]

     __________________________________________________________________

   [487] The name was chosen after older formularies (e.g., the Henoticon
   of Emperor Zeno, the Formula Concordiæ Wittenbergensis, 1536, the
   Formula Concordiæ inter Suevicas et Saxonicas ecclesias, 1576, etc.),
   and occurs first in the edition of Heidelberg, 1582. In the editio
   princeps (1580) the book is called 'Das Buch der Concordien,' but this
   title was afterwards reserved for the collection of all the Lutheran
   symbols ('Concordia,' or 'Liber Concordiæ,' 'Book of Concord'). It was
   also called the Bergische-Buch, from the place of its composition.

   [488] The deepest ground of Luther's aversion to Zwingli must be sought
   in his mysticism and veneration for what he conceived to be the
   unbroken faith of the Church. He strikingly expressed this in his
   letter to Duke Albrecht of Prussia (which might easily be turned into a
   powerful argument against the Reformation itself). He went so far as to
   call Zwingli a non-Christian (Unchrist), and ten times worse than a
   papist (March, 1528, in his Great Confession on the Lords Supper). His
   personal interview with him at Marburg (October, 1529) produced no
   change, but rather intensified his dislike. He saw in the heroic death
   of Zwingli and the defeat of the Zurichers at Cappel (1531) a righteous
   judgment of God, and found fault with the victorious Papists for not
   exterminating his heresy (Wider etliche Rottengeister, Letter to
   Albrecht of Prussia, April, 1532, in De Wette's edition of L. Briefe,
   Vol. IV. pp. 352, 353). And even shortly before his death,
   unnecessarily offended by a new publication of Zwingli's works, he
   renewed the eucharistic controversy in his Short Confession on the
   Lord's Supper (1544, in Walch's edition, Vol. XX. p. 2195), in which he
   abused Zwingli and Oecolampadius as heretics, liars, and murderers of
   souls, and calls the Reformed generally 'eingeteufelte
   [endiabolisthentes], durchteufelte, überteufelte lästerliche Herzen und
   Lügenmäuler.' No wonder that even the gentle Melanchthon called this a
   'most atrocious book,' and gave up all hope for union (letter to
   Bullinger, Aug. 30, 1544, in Corp. Reform. Vol. V. p. 475:
   'Atrocissimum Lutheri scriptum, in quo bellum peri deipnou kuriakou
   instaurat;' comp. also his letter to Bucer, Aug. 28, 1544, in Corp.
   Reform. Vol. V. p. 474, both quoted also by Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 412,
   note 38, and p. 434, note 37). But it should in justice be added,
   first, that Luther's heart was better than his temper, and, secondly,
   that he never said a word against Calvin; on the contrary, he seems to
   have had great regard for him, to judge from his scanty utterances
   concerning him (quoted by Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 414, note 43). Calvin
   behaved admirably on that occasion; he warned Bullinger (Nov. 25, 1544)
   not to forget the extraordinary gifts and services of Luther, and said:
   'Even if he should call me a devil, I would nevertheless honor him as a
   chosen servant of God.' And to Melanchthon he wrote (June 28, 1545): 'I
   confess that we all owe the greatest thanks to Luther, and I should
   cheerfully concede to him the highest authority, if he only knew how to
   control himself. Good God! what jubilee we prepare for the Papists, and
   what sad example do we set to posterity!' Melanchthon entirely agreed
   with him.

   [489] Kahnis {Luth. Dogm. Vol. II. p. 520) traces the changes of
   Melanchthon to 'a truly evangelical search after truth, to a practical
   trait, which easily breaks off the theological edges to bring the
   doctrine nearer to life, and to the endeavor to reconcile opposites.'
   Krauth (Conservative Reformation, p. 289), who sympathizes with strict
   Lutheranism, says: 'Melanchthon's vacillations were due to his timidity
   and gentleness of character, tinged as it was with melancholy; his
   aversion to controversy; his philosophical, humanistic, and classical
   cast of thought, and his extreme delicacy in matters of style; his
   excessive reverence for the testimony of the Church, and of her ancient
   writers; his anxiety that the whole communion of the West should be
   restored to harmony; or that, if this were impossible, the Protestant
   elements, at least, should be at peace.' Comp. on this whole subject
   the works of Galle: Characteristik Melanchthon's als Theologen und
   Entwicklung seines Lehrbegriffs (Halle, 1840), pp. 247 sqq. and 363
   sqq.; Matthes: Phil. Melanchthon (Altenb. 1841); Ebrard: Das Dogma vom
   heil. Abendmahl (Frankf. 1846), Vol. II. pp. 434 sqq.; Gieseler: Church

   sqq.; Kahnis, l.c. pp. 515 sqq.

   [490] Ep. ad Vitum Theodorum, May 24, 1538 (in Corp. Reform. Vol. III.
   p. 537): 'Scias, amplius decennio nullum diem, nullam noctem abiisse,
   quin hac de re cogitarim.'

   [491] Loci theol. first ed. 1521, A. 7: 'Quandoquidem omnia, quæ
   eveniunt, necessario juxta divinam prædestinationem eveniunt, nulla est
   voluntatis nostræ libertas.' In the edition of 1525 he says: 'Omnia
   necessario evenire Scripturæ docent. . . . Nec in externis nec in
   internis operibus ulla est libertas, sed eveniunt omnia juxta
   destinationem divinam. . . . Tollit omnem libertatem voluntatis nostræ
   prædestinatio divina.' (Mel. Opera in Corp. Reform. Vol. XXI. pp. 88,
   93, 95.) In his Commentary on the Romans, published 1524 (cap. 8),
   Melanchthon calls the power of choice a 'ridiculum commentum,' and
   derives all things, 'tam bona quam mala,' from the absolute will of
   God, even the adultery of David ('Davidis adulterium') and the treason
   of Judas ('Judæ proditio'), which are the proper work of God ('ejus
   proprium opus') as much as the vocation of Paul; for he does all things
   not 'permissive, sed potenter.' He saw this doctrine so clearly in the
   Epistle to the Romans and other portions of Scripture that passages
   like 1 Tim. ii. 4 (all men, e.g., all sorts of men) must be adjusted to
   it. See Galle, pp. 252 sqq., and Heppe, Dogmatik des deutschen
   Protestantismus in 16ten Jahrh. (Gotha, 1857) Vol. I. pp. 434 sqq. In
   December, 1525, Luther expressed the same views in his book against
   Erasmus, which he long afterwards (1537) pronounced one of his best
   works. Comp. p. 215, and Köstlin, Luther's Theol. Vol. II. pp. 37, 323.
   But on Melanchthon the reply of Erasmus (1526) had some effect (as we
   may infer from the tone of his letter to Luther, Oct. 2, 1527, Corp.
   Reform. Vol. I. p. 893).

   [492] So in the Augsburg Confession (1530), Art. XVIII.: 'De libero
   arbitrio docent, quod humana voluntas habeat aliquam libertatem ad
   efficiendam civilem justitiam et diligendas res rationi subjectas. Sed
   non habet vim sine Spiritu Sancto efficiendæ justitiæ spiritualis, quia
   animalis homo non percipit ea, quæ sunt Spiritus Dei.' In Art. XIX. the
   cause of sin is traced to the will of man and the devil.

   [493] First in a new edition of his Commentary to the Romans, 1532, and
   then in the edition of the 'Loci communes theologici recogniti,' 1535.
   Here he declares that God is not the cause of sin, but the 'voluntas
   Diaboli' and the 'voluntas hominis sunt causæ peccati;' that we should
   keep clear of the 'deliramenta de Stoico fato aut peri tes anankes,'
   that the human will can 'suis viribus sine renovatione aliquo modo
   externa legis opera facere,' but that it can not 'sine Spiritu Sancto
   efficere spirituales affectus, quos Deus requirit. . . . Deus
   antevertit nos, vocat, movet, adjuvat; sed nos viderimus ne repugnemus.
   Constat enim peccatum oriri a nobis, non a voluntate Dei. Chrysostomus
   inquit: ho de helkon ton boulomenon helkei. Id apte dicitur auspicanti
   a verbo, ne adversetur, ne repugnet verbo.' (See Mel. Opera in Corp.
   Reform. Vol. XXI. pp. 371-376.) In a new revision of his Loci, which
   appeared in 1548, two years after Luther's death, and in all subsequent
   editions, he traces conversion to three concurrent causes--the Spirit
   of God, the Word of God, and the will of man; and states that the will
   may accept or reject God's grace. 'Veteres aliqui,' he says (Corp.
   Reform. Vol. XXI. pp. 567, 659), 'sic dixerunt: Liberum arbitrium in
   homine facultatem esse applicandi se ad gr tiam, i.e., audit
   promissionem et assentiri conatur et abjicit peccata contra
   conscientiam. . . . Cum promissio sit universalis, nec sint in Deo
   contradictoriæ voluntates, necesse est in nobis esse aliquam
   discriminis causam, cur Saul abjiciatur, David recipiatur, i.e.,
   necesse est, aliquam esse actionem dissimilem in his duobus. Hæe dextre
   intellecta vera sunt, et usus in exercitiis fidei et in vera
   consolatione, cum æquiescunt animi in Filio Dei monstrato in
   promissione, illustrabit hanc copulationem causarum, verbi dei,
   spiritus sancti, et voluntatis.' This is the chief passage, which was
   afterwards (1553) assailed as synergistic. Comp. Galle, pp. 314 sqq.;
   Gieseler, Vol. IV. pp. 426 and 434; Heppe, l.c. pp. 434 sqq., and Die
   confessionelle Entwicklung der alt protest. Kirche Deutschlands, pp.
   107 and 130; Kahnis, l.c. Vol. II. p. 505.

   [494] He says (1559): 'Existimo ad confirmandas mentes consensum
   Vetustatis plurimum conducere' (quoted by Galle, p. 452). He endeavored
   to prove the agreement of the fathers with Luther in Sententiæ Patrum
   de Cæna Domini, March, 1530. He there quotes Cyril, Chrysostom,
   Theophylactus, Hilary, Cyprian, Irenæus, Ambrose, and John of Damascus,
   and labors also to bring Augustine on his side, but with difficulty (as
   he says that the body of Christ in uno loco esse), and he admits that
   some passages of Jerome, Gregory of Nazianzum, and Basil might be
   quoted against Luther. See Galle, pp. 390 sqq.

   [495] He wrote to Luther from Augsburg, July 14,1530 (Corp. Reform.
   Vol. II. p. 193): 'Zwinglius misit huc confessionem impressam typis.
   Dicas simpliciter mente captum esse. De peccato originali, de usu
   sacramentorum veteres errores palam renovat. De ceremoniis loquitur
   valde helvetice, hoc est barbarissime, velle se omnes ceremonias esse
   abolitas. Suam causam de sacra coena vehementer urget. Episcopos omnes
   vult deletes esse.'

   [496] In this respect the learned Dialogus of Oecolampadius (1530),
   directed against his Sententiæ, made a decided impression on his mind.
   See Galle, p. 407, and Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 428. He found a great
   diversity of views among the fathers ('mira dissimilitudo,' see letter
   to Bucer, 1535, Corp. Reform. Vol. II. p. 842), but strong proofs for
   the figurative interpretation in Augustine, Tertullian, Origen, and all
   those who speak of the eucharistic elements as figures, symbols, types,
   and antitypes of the body and blood of Christ (see his letter to Crato
   of Breslau, 1559, quoted by Galle, p. 452).

   [497] He first renounced Luther's view, after an interview with Bucer
   at Cassel, in a letter to Camerarius, Jan. 10, 1535 (Corp. Reform. Vol.
   II. p. 822: 'Meam sententiam noli nunc requirere, fui enim nuncius
   aliæ,' i.e., Luther's), and in a confidential letter to Brentius, Jan.
   12, 1535 (Ib. Vol. II. p. 824, where he speaks in a Greek sentence of
   the typical interpretation of many of the ancients). Then more fully in
   the revision of his Loci Theol., 1585 (de cæna Domini, in Corp. Reform.
   Vol. XXI. p. 478 sq.). In the Wittenberg Concordia (1536) he and Bucer
   yielded too much to Luther for the sake of peace (compare, however,
   Dorner, p. 325), but in 1540 he introduced his new conviction into the
   tenth article of the Augsburg Confession (see above, p. 241), and
   adhered to it. In his subsequent deliverances he protested against
   ubiquity and artolatreia, and the fanatical intolerance of the
   ultra-Lutherans, who denounced him as a traitor. Calvin publicly
   declared that he and Melanchthon were inseparably united on this point:
   'Confirmo, non magis a me Philippum quam a propriis visceribus in hac
   causa posse divelli' (Admonitio ultima ad Westphalum, Opp. VIII. p.
   687). Galle maintains that Melanchthon stood entirely on Calvin's side
   (l.c. p. 445). So does Ebrard, who says: 'Melanchthon kam, ohne auf
   Calvin Rücksicht zu nehmen, ja ohne von dessen Lehre wissen zu können,
   auf selbständigem Wege zu derselben Ansicht, welche bei Calvin sich
   ausgebildet hatte' (Das Dogma u. heil. Abendmahl, Vol. II. p. 437). Yet
   in the doctrine of predestination they were wide apart. A beautiful
   specimen of harmony of spirit with diversity in theology! After his
   death Calvin appealed to the sainted spirit of Melanchthon now resting
   with Christ: 'Dixisti centies, cum fessus laboribus et molestiis
   oppressus caput familiariter in sinum meum deponeres: Utinam, utinam
   moriar in hoc sinu! Ego vero millies postea optavi nobis contingere, ut
   simul essemus' (Opp. VIII. p. 724).

   [498] Dorner, l.c. p. 354: 'Melanchthon hat Luther's christologische
   Ansichten aus der Zeit des Abendmahlsstreites nie getheilt. Die
   Menschwerdung besteht ihm in der Aufnahme der menschlichen Natur in die
   Person des Logos, nicht aber in der Einigung (unio) der Natur des Logos
   mit der Menschheit in realer Mittheilung der Prädicate der ersteren an
   die letztere. Die communicatio idiomatum ist ihm nur eine dialektische,
   verbale: die Person des Logos ist Person des ganzen Christus und trägt
   die Menschheit als ihr Organon.'

   [499] 'Responsio Phil. Mel. ad quæstionem de controversia
   Heidelbergensi (Corp. Reform. Vol. IX. p. 961): Non difficile, sed
   periculosum est respondere. . . . In hac controversia optimum esset
   retinere verba Pauli: "Panis, quem frangimus, koinonia esti tou
   somatos." Et copiose de fructu Cænæ dicendum est, ut invitentur homines
   ad amorem hujus pignoris et crebrum usum. Et vocabulum koinonia
   declarandum est. Non dicit, mutari naturam panis, ut Papistæ dicunt;
   non dicit, ut Bremenses, panem esse substantiale Corpus Christi; non
   dicit, ut Heshusius, panem esse verum corpus Christi: sed esse
   koinonian, i.e., hoc, quo fit consociatio cum corpore Christi, quæ fit
   in usu, et quidem non sine cogitatione, ut cum mures panem rodunt. . .
   . Adest Filius Dei in ministerio Evangelii, et ibi certo est efficax in
   credentibus, ac adest non propter panem, sed propter hominem, sicut
   inguit: "Manete in me, et ego in vobis."' Comp. on the whole
   eucharistic doctrine of Melanchthon the learned exposition of Heppe, in
   the third volume of his Dogmatik des deutschen Protestantismus im 16ten
   Jahrh. pp. 143 sqq. He says, p. 150, with reference to the passage just
   quoted: 'Immer und überall betont es Melanchthon, dass Christi Leib und
   Blut im Abendmahle mitgetheilt wird, inwiefern daselbst eine
   Mittheilung des Lebendigen Leibes, der gottmenschlichen Person Christi
   stattfindet, dass die Vereinigung Christi und der Gläubigen, für welche
   das Abendmahl gestiftet ist, eine persönliche Gemeineschaft,
   persönliches, lebendiges, wirksames Einwohnen des Gottmenschen in dem
   Gläubigen ist.' See also Ebrard, Vol. II. pp. 434 sqq.

   [500] Their friendship was, indeed, seriously endangered, and for some
   time suspended, but fully restored again; for it rested on their union
   with Christ. Luther wrote to Melanchthon, June 18, 1540 (Briefe, Vol.
   V. p. 293): 'Nos tecum, et tu nobiscum, et Christus hic et ibi
   nobiscum.' He spoke very highly of Melanchthon's Loci in March, 1545,
   and in January, 1546, he called him a true man, who must be retained in
   Wittenberg, else half the university would go off with him (Corp.
   Reform. Vol. VI. p. 10; Gieseler, Vol. IV. pp. 432-435). Dorner justly
   remarks (l.c. p. 332 sq.): 'Wenn zu dem Edelsten in Luther auch die ihn
   zum Reformator befähigende Weitherzigkeit und Demuth gehörte, womit er
   die eigenthümlichen Gaben Anderer, vor allem Melanchthon's anerkannte,
   so war es das Bestreben jener engherzigen Freunde, Luthern auf sich
   selbst zu beschränken, der Ergänzungsbedürftigkeit auch dieser
   vielleicht grössten nachapostolischen Persönlichkeit zu vergessen und,
   was ihnen jedoch nicht gelang, auch ihn selbst derselben vergessen zu
   machen.' Melanchthon, on his part, although he complained at times of
   Luther's philoneikia (as a pathos, not a crimen), and overbearing
   violence of temper, and thought once (1544) seriously of leaving
   Wittenberg as a 'prison,' admired and loved him to the end, as the
   Elijah of the Reformation and as his spiritual father. In announcing to
   his students the death of Luther (Feb. 18, 1546) on the day following,
   he paid him this noble and just tribute: 'Obiit auriga et currus
   Israel, qui rexit ecclesiam in hac ultima senecta mundi,' and added,
   'Amemus igitur hujus viri memoriam et genus doctrinæ ab ipso traditum,
   et simus modestiores et consideremus ingentes calamitates et mutationes
   magnas, quæ hunc casum sunt secuturæ.' Comp. Planck, l.c. Vol. IV. pp.
   71-77.

   [501] While sick at Smalcald, 1537, he told the Elector of Saxony that
   after his death discord would break out in the University of
   Wittenberg, and his doctrine would be changed. Seckendorf, Com. de
   Lutheranismo,' III. p. 165.

   [502] 'Ego æquissimo animo,' he wrote to Camerarius, Feb 24, 1545
   (Corp. Reform. Vol. V. p.684), 'vel potius anaisthetos fero insolentiam
   kai hubreis multorum, et dum vivam moderate faciam officium meum.'

   [503] Melanchthon applies to them a saying of Polybius, that 'volentes
   videri similes magnis viris,' and being unable to imitate the works
   (erga) of Luther, they imitated his by-works (parerga), 'et producunt
   in theatrum stultitiam suam.' Calvin more severely but not unjustly
   remarks (in his second defense against Westphal, 1556): 'O Luthere,
   quam paucos tuæ præstantiæ imitatores, quam multas vero sanctæ: tuæ
   jactantiæ simias reliquisti!' See Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 435, and
   especially Planck, Vol. IV. pp. 79 sqq.

   [504] The term Philippists (from the Christian name of Melanchthon, who
   was usually called Dr. Philippus) is wider, and embraced the
   Synergists, while the term Crypto-Calvinists applies properly only to
   those who secretly held the Calvinistic doctrine, on the eucharist, but
   not on predestination. Some of the strict Lutherans--as Flacius,
   Amsdorf, and Heshus--held fast to the original views of Luther and
   Melanchthon on predestination, and taught that man was purely passive
   and even repugnant (repugnative) in the work of conversion. Comp.
   Landerer in Herzog, Vol. XI. p. 538.

   [505] Kahnis (Vol. II. p. 520) thus characterizes the two parties:
   'Dort [among the strict Lutherans] das Princip des Festhaltens, hier
   [among the Philippists] das Princip des Fortschreitens; dort scharfe
   Ausschliesslichkeit, hier Weite, Milde, Vermittelung, Union; dort
   fertige, faste Doctrin, hier praktische Elasticität.'

   [506] In the Preface to the Magdeburg Confession, 1550, Luther is
   called 'the third Elijah,' 'the prophet of God,' and Luther's doctrine,
   without any qualification, 'the doctrine of Christ.' See Heppe: Die
   Entstehung and Fortbildung des Lutherthums, pp. 42, 43. In the
   Reussische Confession of 1567 (Heppe, p. 76) it is said: 'We quote
   chiefly the writings of Luther as our prophet (als unseres Propheten),
   and prefer them to the writings of Philippus and others, who are merely
   children of the prophet (Prophetenkinder) and his disciples.' The
   overestimate of Luther is well expressed in the lines--

   'Gottes Wort und Luther's Lehr,

   Vergehet nun und nimmermehr.'

   [507] Prof. Heppe, in his Die Entstehung und Fortbildung des
   Lutherthums und die kirchlichen Bekenntniss-Schriften desselben von
   1548-1576 (Cassel, 1863), gives extracts from twenty Luthern
   Confessions which appeared during this period of twenty-eight years.

   I. p. 60; Dorner, p. 361, and the monograph of Preger on Flacius and
   his Age. Vol. II. p. 310.

   [509] About forty adherents of Flacius, driven to German Austria
   (Opitz, Irenæus, Cölestin, etc.), issued in 1581 a declaration against
   the 'Form of Concord,' as inconsistent with Luther's pure doctrine on
   original sin; but in 1582 they fell out among themselves. As late as
   1604 there were large numbers of Flacianists in German Austria.
   Döllinger, Vol. III. p. 492 sq.

   [510] This remarkable man, born 1520, at Albona, Istria (in Illyria,
   hence called Illyricus), was a convert from Romanism; studied at Basle,
   Tübingen, and Wittenberg under Luther and Melanchthon, and became
   Professor of Hebrew in the University of Wittenberg. Luther attended
   his wedding, and raised him from a state of mental depression almost
   bordering on despair. In consequence of his opposition to the Augsburg
   and Leipzig Interim, Flacius removed to Magdeburg (April, 1549), where
   he opened his literary batteries against Melanchthon and the Interim,
   and undertook with several others the first Protestant Church history,
   under the title of 'The Magdeburg Centuries.' In 1557 he was elected
   Professor in the newly founded University of Jena, but was deposed
   (1562), persecuted, and forsaken even by his former friends. He spent
   the remainder of his life in poverty and exile at Ratisbon, Antwerp,
   Strasburg, and died in a hospital in Frankfort-on-the-Main, March 11,
   1575. Many of his contemporaries, and the learned historian Planck,
   represent him merely as a violent, pugnacious, obstinate fanatic; but
   more recently his virtues and merits have been better appreciated by
   Twesten (Matthias Flacius Illyricus, Berlin, 1844), Kling (who calls
   him one of those witnesses of whom the world was not worthy, in Herzog.
   Vol. IV. p. 410), and W. Preger (M. Fl. Illyr. und seine Zeit,
   Erlangen. 1859-61, 2 vols.). Heppe, from his Melanchthonian standpoint,
   judges him more unfavorably, and thus characterizes him (in his
   Confessionelle Entwicklung, etc., p. 138): 'M. Flac. Illyricus war ein
   fanatischer Verehrer Luther's, der von allen Parteigenossen durch
   Kraft, Consequenz, Klarheit und Sicherheit seiner theologischen
   Speculation und durch Energie des Willens wie des Denkens hervorragend,
   kein Opfer und kein Mittel--auch nicht den schändlichsten Verrath am
   Vertrauen Melanchthon's--scheute, um sein klar erkanntes Ziel, nämlich
   die, Vernichtung Melanchthon's and der bisherigen Tradition des
   Protestantisimus zu erreichen und dem Bekenntniss der Kirche einen ganz
   anderen Charakter aufzuprägen als der war, in dem es sich bisher
   entwickelt hatte.' The library of the Union Theological Seminary, New
   York, possesses a rare collection of the numerous polemical tracts of
   Flacius. He has undoubted merits in Church history and exegesis. His
   best works, besides the 'Magdeburg Centuries,' are his Catalogus
   testium veritatis, Basil. 1556, and his Clavis Scripturæ Sacræ, 2 P.
   Basil. 1567.

   [511] By to sumbebekos Aristotle means a separable property or quality,
   which does not essentially belong to a thing. In this sense Flacius
   denied the accidental character of sin, and maintained that it entered
   into the inmost constitution, just as holiness is inherent and
   essential in the regenerate.

   [518] He thought that 'after the death of the lion he could easily
   dispose of the hares and foxes.' But the germ of his doctrine was
   already in his tract, 'Ein gut Unterricht und getreuer Rathschlag aus
   heil. göttlicher Schrift,' 1524. At the Diet of Augsburg, 1530, he
   requested Melanchthon, in the presence of Brentius and Urban Regius, to
   introduce into the new confession of faith the passage Jer. xxiii. 6,
   'The Lord our Righteousness,' which he understood to mean that Christ
   dwells in us by faith, and works in us both to will and to do. See

   [523] Georg Karg was born 1512, studied at Wittenberg, was ordained by
   Luther and Melanchthon, became pastor at Oettingen, afterwards at
   Ansbach, and died 1576. He was a rigid Lutheran in the Interimistic
   controversies, but otherwise more a follower of Melanchthon.

   Piscator). See Döllinger, Vol. III. p. 573; Schweizer: Centraldogmen,

   [526] See his classical description of faith in the Preface to the
   Epistle to the Romans (Walch, Vol. XIV. p. 114, quoted also in the
   'Form of Concord,' p. 626, ed. Müller): 'Der Glaube ist ein göttlich
   Werk in uns, das uns verwandelt und neu gebiert aus Gott und tödtet den
   alten Adam, macht uns ganz andere Menschen . . . und bringet den
   heiligen Geist mit sich. O! es ist ein lebendig, geschäftig, thätig,
   mächtig Ding um den Glauben, dass es unmöglich ist, dass er nicht ohne
   Unterlass sollte Gutes wirken; er fragt auch nicht, ob gute Werke zu
   thun sind, sondern ehe man fragt, hat er sie gethan, und ist immer im
   Thun. Weraber nicht solche Werke thut, der ist ein glaubloser Mensch. .
   . . Werke vom Glauben scheiden is so unmöglich als brennen und leuchten
   vom Feuer mag geschieden werden.' In another place Luther says: 'So
   wenig das Feuer ohne Hitze und Rauch ist, so wenig ist der Glaube ohne
   Liebe.'

   [527] Loci theol. ed. 1535 (the edition dedicated to King Henry VIII.):
   'Obedientia nostra, hoc est, justitia bonæ conscientiæ seu operum, quæ
   Deus nobis præcipit, necessario sequi debet reconciliationem. . . . Si
   vis in vitam ingredi, serva mandata (Matt. xix. 17). . . . Justificamur
   ut nova et spirituali vita vivamus. . . . Ipsius opus sumus, conditi ad
   bona opera (Eph. ii. 10). . . . Acceptatio ad vitam æternam seu donatio
   vitæ æternæ conjuncta est cum justificatione, i.e., cum remissione
   peccatorum et reconciliatione, quæ fide contingit. . . . Itaque non
   datur vita æterna propter dignitatem bonorum operum, sed gratis propter
   Christum. Et tamen bona opera ita necessaria sunt ad vitam æternam,
   quia sequi reconciliationem necessario debent' (Corp. Reform. Vol. XXI.
   p. 429).

   [528] 'Bona opera necessaria esse ad salutem.'

   [529] He found it necessary afterwards to qualify his proposition,
   especially since Melanchthon, to his surprise, did not quite approve
   it. He assigned to good works a necessitas debiti, as commanded by God,
   a necessitas conjunctionis, as connected with faith, but no necessitas
   meriti. Our whole confidence is in Christ. 'Hominem,' he said, 'sola
   fide esse justum, sed non sola fide salvum.'

   [530] Viz., the words, 'Es ist gewisslich wahr, dass die Tugenden
   Glaube, Liebe, Hoffnung, und andere in uns sein müssen und zur
   Seligkeit nöthig seien.' In Pezel's edition of Melanchthon's 'Bedenken'
   the words zur Seligkeit are omitted. Döllinger, Vol. III. p. 496.

   [531] 'Bona opera perniciosa (noxia) esse [not in themselves, but] ad
   salutem.' Whoever held the opposite view was denounced by Amsdorf as a
   Pelagianer, Mameluk, zweifältiger Papist and Verläugner Christi.

   [532] See the extracts from Flacius, in Döllinger, Vol. III. pp. 503
   sqq.

   [533] See the theses in Döllinger, Vol. III. p. 511 sq.

   [534] See his brief Judicium on the Majoristic controversy, 1553, Corp.
   Reform. Vol. VIII. p. 194, and his more lengthy German letter ad
   Senatum Northusanum (Nordhausen), Jan. 13, 1555; Ibid., pp. 410-413.
   'Diese Deutung, 'he says (p. 412), 'ist zu fliehen: gute Werke sind
   Verdienst der Seligkeit; und muss der Glaub und Trost fest allein auf
   dem Herrn Christo stehen, dass wir gewisslich durch ihn allein, propter
   eum et per eum, haben Vergebung der Sünden, Zurchnung der
   Gerechtigkeit, heiligen Geist, und Erbschaft der ewigen Seligkeit.
   Dieses Fundament ist gewiss. Es folget auch eben aus diesem Fundament,
   dass diese andere Proposition recht und nöthig ist: gute Werke oder
   neuer Gehorsam ist nöthig von wegen göttlicher, unwandelbarer Ordnung,
   dass die vernünftige Creatur Gott Gehorsam schuldig ist, und dazu
   erschaffen, und jetzund wiedergeboren ist, dass sie ihm gleichförmig
   werde.' Melanchthon heard from an Englishman that this controversy
   created great astonishment in England, where no one doubted the
   necessity of good works to salvation, nor failed to see the difference
   between necessity and merit.

   [535] In accordance with the word of Augustine: 'Opera sequuntur
   justificatam, non præcedunt justificandum.' Three or four of the
   framers of the 'Form of Concord' were inclined to Major's view, and
   endeavored at first to prevent its condemnation; but the logic of the
   Lutheran principle triumphed.

   [537] Gass says (Vol. I. p. 57): 'Die Reformation war selbst
   Antinomismus, insofern sie mit dem werkheiligen auch das gesetzliche
   Princip, wenn es die Seligkeit des Menschen bewirken will, verwarf.
   Melanchthon hatte Gesetz und Evangelium wie Schreck- und Trostmittel
   einander entgegengestellt und nur auf das letzere die Rechtfertigung
   gebaut, während er doch unter dem Gesetz den bleibenden Inhalt des
   göttlichen Willens zusammenfasst.'

   [538] Many of his utterances, as quoted by Döllinger, Vol. III. pp. 45
   sqq., sound decidedly antinomian, but must be understood cum grano
   salis, and in connection with his whole teaching. Some of the most
   objectionable are from his 'Table Talk,' as when he calls Moses 'the
   master of all hangmen' and 'the worst of heretics.'

   [539] Agricola (Schnitter, Kornschneider; Luther called him Grickl) was
   born at Eisleben, 1492 (hence Magister Islebius), and studied at
   Wittenberg, where he boarded with Luther. He was a popular preacher at
   Eisleben, and became Professor of Theology at Wittenberg, 1536, and
   chaplain of Elector Joachim II. at Berlin, 1540. In 1548 he took a
   leading part in the Augsburg Interim, and denied the essential
   principles of Protestantism, but protested afterwards from the pulpit
   against the necessity of good works (1558). He died at Berlin, 1566.
   Luther was more vexed by him, as he said, than by any pope; he charged
   him with excessive vanity and ambition, and declared him unfit to
   teach, and fit only for the profession of a jester (Briefe, Vol. V. p.
   321). He refused to see him in 1545, and said, 'Grickl wird in alle
   Ewigkeit Grickl bleiben.' Bretschneider and Gieseler suppose that
   Melanchthon incurred Agricola's displeasure by not helping him to a
   theological chair in Wittenberg. He must have had, however,
   considerable administrative capacity. Döllinger charges the Reformers
   with misrepresenting him and his doctrine.

   without effect. Compare the remarks of Dorner, p. 401.

   [543] 'Fatemur,' he says in his First Defense, 'Christum, quod panis et
   vini symbolis figurat, vere præstare, ut animas nostras carnis suæ esu
   et sanguinis potione alat. . . . Hujus rei non fallacem oculis proponi
   figuram dicimus, sed pignus nobis porrigi, cui res ipsa et veritas
   conjuncta est: quod scilicet Christi carne et sanguine animæ nostræ
   pascantur' (in the new edition of his Opera, Vol. IX. p. 30). In the
   Second Defense: 'Christum corpore absentem doceo nihilominus non tantum
   divina sua virtute, quæ ubique diffusa est, nobis adesse, sed etiam
   facere ut nobis vivifica. sit sua caro (Vol. IX. p. 76). . . . Cænam
   plus centies dici sacrum esse vinculum nostræ cum Christo unitatis (p.
   77). . . . Spiritus sui virtute Christus locorum distantiam superat ad
   vitam nobis e sua carne inspirandam' (p. 77). . . . And in his Last
   Admonition: 'Hæc nostræ doctrinæ summa est, carnem Christi panem esse
   vivificum, quia dum fide in eam coalescimus, vere aninas nostras alit
   et pascit. Hoc nonnisi spiritualiter fieri docemus, quia hujus sacræ
   unitatis vinculum arcana est et incomprehensibilis Spiritus Sancti
   virtus' (Vol. IX. p. 162).

   [544] He wrote to Calvin, Oct. 14, 1554 (Corp. Reform. Vol. VIII. p.
   362): 'Quod in proximis literis hortaris, ut reprimam ineruditos
   clamores illorum, qui renovant certamen peri artolatreias, scito,
   quosdam p&acelig;cipue odio mei eam disputationem movere, ut habeant
   plausibilem causam ad me opprimendum.' To Hardenberg, in Bremen, May 9,
   1557: 'Crescit, ut vides, non modo certamen, sed etiam rabies in
   scriptoribus, qui artolatreian stabiliunt.' And to Mordeisen, Nov. 15,
   1557 (Corp. Reform. Vol. IX. p. 374): 'Si mihi concedatis, ut in alia
   loco vivam, respondebo illis indoctis sycophantis et vere et graviter,
   et dicam utilia ecclesiæ.' He gave, however, his views pretty clearly
   and dispassionately shortly before his death in his vota on the Breslau
   and Heidelberg troubles (1559 and 1560).

   [545] His German name was Hesshusen. He was one of the most pugnacious
   divines of his age; born 1527 at Nieder-Wesel, died 1588 at Helmstädt.
   See Leuckfeld's biography, Historia Heshusiana (1716), and Henke, in
   Herzog, Vol. VI. p. 49.

   [546] In his last book against Bullinger (1564). See Hartmann, Brenz,
   p. 252.

   [547] He was undeceived by a new deception. The crisis was brought
   about by the discovery of a confidential correspondence with the
   Reformed in the Palatinate, and especially by the appearance in Leipzig
   of the anonymous Exegesis perspicua controversiæ de Cæna Domini, 1574
   (newly edited by Scheffer, Marburg, 1853), which openly rejected the
   manducatio oralis, and defended Calvin's view of the eucharist (though
   without naming him), while the Consensus Dresdensis (1571) had
   concealed it under Lutheran phraseology. This work was generally
   attributed to Peucer and the Wittenberg Professors, in spite of their
   steadfast denial, but it was the product of a Silesian physician,
   Joachim Cureus. See the proof in Heppe, Vol. II. pp. 468 sqq.

   [548] Cruciger, Moller, Wiedebram, and Pezel (whom the Lutherans called
   Beelzebub) refused to recant. The first went to Hesse, the second to
   Hamburg, the other two to Nassau. The old and weak Major yielded to the
   condemnation of Melanchthon's view. Several other Wittenberg Professors
   were likewise deposed.

   [549] Peucer was released in 1586, at the intercession of the beautiful
   Princess Agnes Hedwig of Anhalt, and became physician of the Prince of
   Dessau, where he died, 1602. He wrote the history of his prison life,
   Historia carcerum et liberationis divinæ, ed. by Pezel, Tig. 1605. On
   his theory of the real presence, see Galle, pp. 460 sqq. He rejected
   the Lutheran view much more strongly than his father-in-law,
   Melanchthon, and thought it had no more foundation in the Bible than
   the popish transubstantiation. Comp. Henke: Casp. Peucer und Nic.
   Crell, Marburg, 1865.

   [550] He was charged with intermeddling in matters of religion, and
   advising a dangerous treaty with the Reformed Henry IV. of France
   against Austria. The suit was referred to an Austrian court of appeals
   at Prague, and decided in the political interest of Austria with a
   violation of all justice. His confession of guilt before his heavenly
   Judge was distorted by his fanatical opponents into a confession of
   guilt before his human judges. It is often stated that he was not
   beheaded for religion ('non ob religionem, sed ob perfidiam
   multiplicem,' as Hutter says, Concordia concors, pp. 448 and 1258). But
   his Calvinism, or rather his Melanchthonianism (for he never read a
   line of Calvin), was the only crime which could he proved against him;
   he always acted under the direction and command of the Elector, and he
   had accepted the chancellorship with a clear confession of his views,
   and the assurance of his Prince that he should be protected in it, and
   never be troubled with subscribing to the 'Form of Concord.' As judge,
   he was admitted, even by his enemies, to have been impartial and just
   to the poor as well as the rich. Comp. Hasse: Ueber den Crell'schen
   Process, in Niedner's Zeitschrift für hist. Theol. 1848, No. 2; Vogt in

   [554] Origen first taught the ubiquity of the body of Christ, in
   connection with his docetistic idealism, but without any regard to the
   eucharist, and was followed by Gregory of Nyssa (Orat. 40, and Adv.
   Apollinar. c. 59). They held that Christ's body after the resurrection
   was so spiritualized and deified as to lay aside all limitations of
   nature, and to be in all parts of the world as well as in heaven. See
   Gieseler's Commentatio qua Clementis Alex. et Origenis doctrinæ de
   corpore Christi exponuntur, Gott. 1837, and Neander's Dogmengeschichte,
   Vol. I. pp. 217, 834. Cyril of Alexandria held a similar view (Christ's
   body is 'every where,' pantachou), but in connection with an almost
   monophysitic Christology. Scotus Erigena revived Origen's ubiquity,
   gave it a pantheistic turn, and made it subservient to his view of the
   eucharistic presence, which he regarded merely as a symbol of the every
   where present Christ. Neander, Vol. II. p. 43.

   [555] On Luther's Christology and ubiquity doctrine, see Heppe (Ref.):
   Dogmatik, des D. Protest. im 16ten Jahrh. Vol. II. pp. 93 sqq., and
   Köstlin (Luth.): Luther's Theol. Vol. II. pp. 118, 153, 167, 172, 512.
   Köstlin, without adopting Luther's views of ubiquity, finds in them
   'grossartige, tiefe, geist- und lebensvolle Anschauungen vom göttlichen
   Sein und Leben' (Vol. II. p. 154).

   [556] In his Grosse Bekenntniss vom Abendmahl, published 1528 (in
   Walch's ed. Vol. XX.; in the Erlangen ed. Vol. XXX.), he says: 'Kann
   Christus' Leib über Tisch sitzen and dennoch im Brot sein, so kann er
   auch im Himmel und wo er will sein und dennoch im Brot sein; es ist
   kein Unterschied fern oder nah bei dem Tische sein, dazu dass er
   zugleich im Brot sei. . . . es sollte mir ein schlechter Christus
   bleiben, der nicht mehr, denn an einem einzelnen Orte zugleich eine
   göttliche and menschliche Person wäre, und an allen anderen Orten
   müsste er allein ein blosser abgesonderter Gott und göttliche Person
   sein ohne Menschseit. Nein, Geselle, wo du mir Gott hinsetzest, da must
   du mir die Menschheit mit hinsetzen. Die lassen sich nicht sondern und
   von einander trennen; es ist Eine Person worden und scheidet die
   Menschseit nicht so von sich, wie Meister Hans seinen Rock auszieht und
   von sich legt, wenn er schlafen geht. Denn, dass ich den Einfältigen
   ein grob Gleichniss gebe, die Menschheit ist näher vereinigt mit Gott,
   denn unsere Haut mit unserm Fleische, ja näher denn Leib und Seele.'

   [557] He ridicules the popular conception of heaven and the throne of
   God as childish: 'Die Rechte Gottes,' he says, l.c., 'ist nicht ein
   sonderlicher Ort, da ein Leib solle oder möge sein, nicht ein
   Gaukelhimmel, wie man ihn den Kindern pflegt vorzubilden, darin ein
   gülden Stuhl stehe und Christus neben dem Vater sitze in einer
   Chorkappen und gülden Krone. . . . Die Rechte Gottes ist an allen
   Enden, so ist sie gewisslich auch im Brot und Wein über Tische. . . .
   Wo nun die Rechte Gottes ist, da muss Christi Leib und Blut auch sein;
   denn die Rechte Gottes ist nicht zu theilen in viele Stücke, sondern
   ein einiges einfältiges Wesen.' If this prove any thing, it proves the
   absolute omnipresence of Christ's body. And so Brentius taught.

   [558] De inhabitatione Dei in Sanctis ad Osiandrum, 1551 (Consil. Lat.
   Vol. II. p. 156): 'Tota antiquitas declarans hanc propositionem:
   Christus est ubique, sic declarat: Christus est ubique personaliter. Et
   verissimum est, Filium Dei, Deum et hominem habitare in sanctis. Sed
   antiquitas hanc propositionem rejicit: Christus corporaliter est
   ubique. Quia natura quælibet retinet sua idiomata. Unde Augustinus et
   alii dicunt: Christi corpus est in certo loco. . . Cavendum est, ne ita
   astruamus divinitatem hominis Christi, ut veritatem corporis
   auferamus.' In a new edition of his lectures on the Colossians (1556
   and 1559), he maintains the literal meaning of the ascension of Christ,
   'i.e., in locum coelestem. . . . Ascensio fuit visibilis et corporalis,
   et sæpe ita scripsit tota antiquitas, Christum corporali locatione in
   aliquo loco esse, ubicunque vult. Corpus localiter alicubi est secundum
   verum corporis modum, ut Augustinus inquit.' See Galle, p. 448.

   [559] See on his Christology chiefly Heppe, Vol. II. pp. 99 sqq.

   [560] 'Finitum non capax est infiniti.'

   [561] Both parties published an account--the Lutherans at
   Frankfort-on-the-Main, the Reformed at Heidelberg. The latter is more
   full, and bears the title: Protocollum, h. e. Acta Colloquii inter
   Palatinos et Wirtebergicos Theologos de Ubiquitate sive Omnipræsentia
   corporis Christi. . . . A. 1564 Maulbrunni habiti (Heidelb. 1566). See
   a full résumé of the Colloquy in Ebrard: Abendmahl, Vol. II. pp.
   666-685; Sudhoff: Olevian und Ursin, pp.260-290; in Hartmann: Joh.
   Brenz, pp. 253-256, and in the larger work of Hartmann and Jäger on
   Brenz, 1840-42, Vol. II.

   [562] Andreæ asserted that Christ's body, when in Mary's womb, was
   omnipresent as to possession (possessione), though not as to
   manifestation (non patefactione). Sudhoff, p. 279. This is the Tübingen
   doctrine of the krupsis. See below.

   [563] The same Lutherans, who so strenuously insisted on the literal
   interpretation of the esti, outdid the Reformed in the figurative
   interpretation of all these passages, and explained the ascension and
   heaven itself out of the Bible.

   [564] Ebrard says (Vol. II. p. 685): 'So endete das Maulbronner
   Gespräch mit einer vollständigen Niederlage der Lutheraner.' Sudhoff
   (p. 290): 'Es kann von niemandem in Abrede gestellt werden, dass die
   Pfälzer als Sieger aus diesem Streite hervorgegangen,' and he publishes
   several manuscript letters giving the impressions of the Colloquy on
   those present. The Swabians returned discontented, but without change
   of conviction. Dorner, although a Lutheran, and a Swabian by descent,
   gives the Reformed Christology in many respects the preference before
   the Lutheran, and says (Vol. II. p. 724): 'Es ist unbestreitbar, dass
   die reformirte christologische Literatur, die um die Zeit der
   Concordienformel ihren Blüthepunkt erreicht, durch Geist, Scharfsinn,
   Gelehrsamkeit und philosophische Bildung der lutherischen Theologie
   vollkommen ebenbürtig, ja in manchen Beziehungen überlegen ist.' He
   then gives a fine analysis of the Christology of Beza, Danæus, Sadeel,
   and Ursinus.

   Reformed against the Lutheran ubiquity. On the Christology of Brenz,

   Ebrard: Abendmahl, Vol. II. pp. 646 sqq. (Brenz und die Ubiquität); and

   [567] 'Majestatem divinam tempore carnis suæ in hoc seculo dissimulavit
   seu ea sese (ut Paulus loquitur) exinanivit, tamen numquam ea caruit. .
   . . Texit et obduxit suam majestatem forma servi.'

   [568] 'Eum tunc manifesto spectaculo voluisse testificari et declarare,
   se verum Deun et hominem, hoc est, una cum divinitate et humanitate sua
   jam inde ab initio suæ incarnationis omnia implevisse.'

   [569] 'Ubicunque est Deitas, ibi etiam est humanitas Christi.'

   [570] Brenz was followed by Jacob Andreæ, Schegck, and the Swabians
   generally, who have shown a good deal of speculative genius (down to
   Schelling, Hegel, and Baur), and also by a few divines of North
   Germany, as Andreas Musculus, John Wigand, and for a time by Heshusius,
   who afterwards opposed absolute ubiquity. Leonhard Hutter and Ægidius
   Hunnius, who were Swabians by birth, likewise took substantially the
   Swabian view, though more for the purpose of maintaining the authority
   of the 'Formula of Concord.' See Dorner, Vol. II. p. 775.

   (Dogm. Vol. II. p. 131): 'Der Gegensatz der melanchthonischen und der
   würtembergisch-brenzischen Christologie ist sonnenklar. Jene erbaut
   sich auf dem Gedanken, dass Gott wirklicher Mensch geworden ist,
   während diese sich um den Gedanken lagert, dass ein Mensch Gott
   geworden ist.'

   [572] 'Præsentia hæc assumtæ naturæ in Christo non est naturalis, vel
   essentialis, sed voluntaria et liberrima, dependens a voluntate et
   potentia Filii Dei, h. e. ubi se hmnana natura adesse velle certo verbo
   tradidit, promisit et asseveravit.'

   [573] Confessio et doctrina theologorum in Ducatu Wurtembergensi de
   vera præsentia corporis et sanguinis J. Chr. in Cæna dominica. Here the
   absolute ubiquity is taught, not, indeed, in the way of a 'diffusio
   humanæ naturæ' or 'distractio membroram Christi,' but so that 'homo
   Christus quoque implet omnia modo cælesti et humanæ naturæ
   imperscrutabili.' See the German in Heppe: Die Entstehung and
   Fortbildung des Lutherthums und die kirchl. Bekenntniss-Schriften
   desselben, p. 63. Melanchthon concealed his grief over this change of
   Brenz beneath a facetious remark to a friend on the poor Latinity of
   this confession ('Hechingense Latinum:' Corp. Reform. Vol. IX. p. 1036;
   comp. Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 454; J. Hartmann: Joh. Brenz, p. 249).

   [574] Heshusius wrote concerning this Colloquy: 'Constanter rejicio
   ubiquitatem. Chemnitzius, Kirchnerus, Chytræus antea rejecerunt eam:
   nunc in gratiam Tubingensium cum magno ecclesiæ scandalo ejus
   patrocinium suscipiunt, ipsorum igitur constantia potius accusanda
   est.' Comp. Acta disput.Quedlinb.; Dorner, Vol. II. p. 773; Heppe, Vol.

   [576] Hence they were called Kenotiker, Kenoticists.

   [577] Hence their name, Kryptiker, Krypticists.

   [578] Indistantia, nuda adessentia ad creaturas, præsentia simplex.

   [579] Actio, operatio, præsentia modificata. This amounts to pretty
   much the same thing with the omimpræsentia energetica of the
   Calvinists.

   [580] The same applies to omnipotence. The Tübingen divines gave an
   affirmative answer to the question, 'An homo Christus in Deum assumptus
   in statu exinanitionis tamquam rex præsens cuncta, licet latenter,
   gubernarit?' They made, however, an apparent concession to their
   opponents by assuming a brief suspension of the use of the divine
   majesty during the agony in Gethsemane and the crucifixion, in order
   that Christ might really suffer as high-priest. See Dorner, Vol. II. p.
   799.

   [581] 'In an individual,' says Strauss, in the dogmatic conclusion of
   his first Leben Jesu (Vol. II. p. 710}. 'in one God-man, the properties
   and functions which the Church doctrine ascribes to Christ contradict
   themselves; in the idea of the race they agree. Humanity is the union
   of the two natures--the incarnate God--the infinite externalizing
   itself in the finite, and the finite spirit remembering its
   infinitude.'

   [582] So Thomasius, Liebner, Gess. But the absolute ubiquity also has
   found an advocate in Philippi (Kirchl. Glaubenslehre, Vol. IV. I. pp.
   394). Dr. Stahl, the able theological lawyer, in his Die lutherische
   Kirche und die Union (Berlin, 1859, pp.185 sqq.), admits that the
   ubiquity question has no religious interest except as a speculative
   basis for the possibility of the eucharistic presence, and approaches
   Ebrard's view of an 'extra-spacial, central communication of the
   virtue' of Christ's body to the believer. Dr. Krauth defends Chemnitz's
   view, and what he would rather style 'the personal omnipresence of the
   human nature of Christ' (l.c. p. 496). But the human nature of Christ
   is impersonal, and simply taken up into union with the pre-existent
   personality of the Divine Logos.

   Wittenberg, became pastor at St. Peter's, Hamburg, 1529, Superintendent
   in 1532, introduced the Reformation into that city, signed the Articles
   of Smalcald, 1537, stood in high esteem, and died 1553. He was a
   colleague of Westphal, and opposed with Flacius the Leipzig Interim.

   Melanchthon, p. 554 sq. In his Loci, Melanchthon passes by the
   descensus as unessential. In a letter to Spalatin, March 20,1531 (Corp.
   Reform. Vol. II. p. 490), he expresses his inability to explain the
   dark passage, 1 Pet. iii. 19, 20. He was pleased with Luther's sermon
   at Torgau, but added, in a private letter to Anton Musa (March 12,
   1543, Corp. Reform. Vol. V. p. 58), that Christ probably preached the
   gospel to the heathen in the spirit world, and converted such men as
   Scipio and Fabius. (Zwingli likewise believed in the salvation of the
   nobler heathen.) He wrote to Æpinus, April 20, 1546 (Corp. Reform. Vol.
   VI. p. 116), to preach the necessary doctrines of faith, repentance,
   prayer, good works, rather than speculations on things which even the
   most learned did not know.

   [587] See his humorous letter to Buchholzer in Berlin, Dec. 4, 1539
   (Briefe, Vol. V. p. 235), which might have considerably embarrassed the
   anti-Adiaphorists had they known it. He advises Elector Joachim II.
   that in introducing the Reformation he may, if he desired it, put on
   one or three priestly garments, like Aaron; may hold one or even seven
   processions, like Joshua before Jericho; and may dance before it, as
   David danced before the ark, provided only such things were not made
   necessary for salvation.

   [588] See the text of the two Interims in Gieseler, Vol. IV. pp.
   193-196 and 201-203; the Interim Lipsiense, also, in Corp. Reform. Vol.
   VII. The term gave rise to sarcastic conundrums, as Interimo,
   interitus, Hinterim, der Schalk ist hinter ihm (the villain is behind
   it). On the political aspects of the Interim, see the fifth volume of
   Ranke.

   [589] To the Augsburg Interim he was decidedly opposed, and he had also
   sundry objections to the ceremonial part of the Leipzig Interim. He is
   only responsible for its doctrinal part. See his letters from this
   period in Corp. Reform. Vols. VI. and VII., and Schmidt's Mel. pp. 507
   and 524.

   [590] In a letter to his enemy, M. Flacius, dated Sept. 5, 1556, he was
   not ashamed to confess, after some slight reproaches, 'Vincite! Cedo;
   nihil pugno de ritibus illis, et maxime opto, ut dulcis sit ecclesiarum
   concordia. Fateor etiam hac in re a me peccatum esse, et a Deo veniam
   peto, quod non procul fugi insidiosas illas deliberationes. Sed illa
   quæ mihi falsa a te et a Gallo objiciuntur, refutabo.' Corp. Reform.
   Vol. VIII. p. 841 sq. And to the Saxon pastors he wrote, Jan. 17, 1557
   (Vol. IX. p. 61): 'Pertractus sum ad aularum deliberationes insidiosas.
   Quare sicubi vel lapsus sum, vel languidius aliquid egi, peto a Deo et
   ab Ecclesia veniam, et judiciis Ecclesiæ obtemperabo.'

   [591] Thus he concisely states the case on the long title-page of his
   Apology, or Entschuldigung, etc., addressed to the University of
   Wittenberg, with a letter to Melanchthon, Magdeburg, 1549. The
   concluding words of the title state the aim of the Interim thus: 'Das
   Ende ist die Einsetzung des Papstthums und Einstellung des Antichrists
   in den Tempel Christi, Stärkung der Gottlosen, dass sie über der Kirche
   Christi stolziren, Betrübung der Gottfürchtigen, item Schwächung,
   Einführung in Zweifel, Trennung und unzählige Aergerniss.' He relates
   of Melanchthon that he derived from an eclipse of the moon in 1548 the
   vain hope of the near death of the Emperor, which would end these
   troubles. He also published several confidential letters of Luther to
   Melanchthon, written during the Diet at Augsburg, 1530, upbraiding him
   for his philosophy and timidity.

   [592] Opera, Vol. IX. p. 51, and Letters of Calvin, by J. Bonnet,

   import to Melanchthon, by his friend Anton Corvinus (Räbener), a
   distinguished reformer in Hesse and Göttingen, who suffered
   imprisonment for his opposition to the Interim, was recently discovered
   in the Royal Library at Hanover by Iwan Franz, and published in Kahnis,
   Zeitschrift fur die hist. Theol. 1874, pp. 105 sqq., from which I quote
   the following passages: 'O Philippe, o inquam Philippe noster, redi per
   immortalem Christum ad pristinum candorem, ad pristinam tuam
   sinceritatem! non languefacito ista tua formidine, pusillanimitate et
   inepta moderatione nostrorum animos tantopere! Non aperito hac ratione
   ad Papatus recurrentem impietatem ac Idolomanias fenestram ac januam!
   Non sis tantorum in Ecclesia offendiculorum autor! Ne sinas tua tam
   egregia scripta, dicta, facta, quibus mirifice de Ecclesia hactenus
   meritus es, isto condonationis, moderationis, novationis nævo ad eum
   modum deformari! Cogita, quantum animi ista nostra carnis ac rationis
   consilia et adversariis addant et nostris adimant.! Perpende, quam
   placari etiam istis condonationibus adversarii nostri non queant, qui
   totius Papatus doctrinam et omnes ex cequo impios cultus reposcunt et
   ex nostra levitate spem concipiunt se hac in re facile voti compotes
   futuros. Detestatur Dominus apud Jeremiam eos, qui manus pessimormn
   confortant, ut non convertatur unusquisque a malitia sua. Cur igitur in
   tam ardua causa non tales nos gerimus ut hujusmodi detestatio competere
   in nos haud possit? qua perversitate arundo huc illuc ventis agitata
   dici quam Johannis constantiam imitari malumus! . . . Proinde Te, o
   noster Philippe, iterum atque iterum per ilium ipsum Christum
   redemptorem nostrum et brevi futurum judicem rogamus, ut professionis
   tuæ memor talem te cum reliquis Vitebergensibus jam geras, qualem Te ab
   initio hujus causæ ad Electoris captivitatem usque gessisti, hoc est,
   ut ea sentias, dicas, scribas, agas, quæ Philippum, Christianum
   Doctorem decent, non aulicum Philosophum.'

   [594] The Philippist Lasius first asserted (1568) that Luther had
   recalled his book De servo arbitrio (1525), but this was indignantly
   characterized by Flacius and Westphal as a wretched lie and an insult
   to the evangelical church. The fact is that Luther emphatically
   reaffirmed this book, in a letter to Capito, 1537, as one of his very
   best ('nullum enim agnosco meum justum librum nisi forte De servo
   arbitrio, et Catechismum'). And, indeed, it is one of his most powerful
   works. Luthardt (Die Lehre vom freien Willen, Leipz. 1863, p. 122)
   calls it 'eine mächtige Schrift, stoltz, wahrheitsgewiss, kühn in
   Gedanken und Wort, voll heiligen Eifers, gewaltigen Ernstes, aus
   innerster Seele herausgeschrieben. . . . Kaum irgendwo sonst ergiesst
   sich gleich mächtig und reich der Strom seines Geistes.' Only in regard
   to predestination Luther may be said to have moderated his view
   somewhat, although he never recalled it, that is, he still taught in
   his later writings (in his Com. on Genesis, Ch. VI. 6, 18; Ch. XXVI.)
   the distinction and antagonism between the revealed will of God, which
   sincerely calls all to repentance and salvation, and the inscrutable
   secret will which saves only a part of the race; but he laid the main
   stress practically on the former and the means of grace, and thus
   prepared the way for the 11th Article of the Formula of Concord.
   'Scripsi,' he wrote in 1536, 'esse omnia absoluta et necessaria, sed
   simul addidi, quod adspiciendus sit Deus revelatus' (Opera exeg. Vol.
   VI. p. 300). Luthardt (l.c. p. 146) correctly says (in opposition both
   to Lütkens and Philippi) that Luther never recalled, but retained his
   earlier views on predestination and the necessity of all that happens,
   and only guarded them against abuse. The result of Köstlin's
   investigation is this, that Luther never attempted a solution of the
   contradiction between the secret and the revealed will of God. 'Das
   eben ist seine Lehre, dass unser Erkennen nicht so weit reicht, und
   dass wir uns auch das Unbegreifliche und Unverständliche gefallen
   lassen müssen. . . . Er selbst spricht aus, dass ein Widerspruch für
   uns stehen bleibe, den wir nicht lösen können noch sollen.' Luther's
   Theologie, Vol. II. p. 328.

   [596] See Schweizer, l.c. pp. 402 sqq. Heshusius and Westphal invented
   the name Calvinists, which henceforth was used by Lutherans for the
   Reformed, as the term Zwinglians had been before. The term
   sacramentarians was applied to both without distinction.

   [597] Melanchthon called him mediocriter doctus, but his own estimate
   was much higher, and in his inaugural he spoke with such arrogance that
   Bucer feared he would prove a great misfortune for the Church at
   Strasburg. See Röhrich and Schweizer, p. 420.

   Schweizer, pp. 425-436. Zanchi accepted afterwards a call to a
   professorship at the Reformed University of Heidelberg, where he died,
   1590. He received also calls to England, Lausanne, Geneva, Zurich, and
   Leyden, and was justly esteemed for his learning and character. A
   complete edition of his works appeared at Geneva in eight parts, in 3
   vols. folio.

   [602] Spener was born at Rappoltsweiler, in Upper Alsace, but his
   parents were from Strasburg, and he was educated there, and called
   himself a Strasburger. Kliefoth (as quoted by Heppe, Vol. IV. p. 399),
   from his own rigid Lutheran stand-point, says, not without good reason:
   'Mit Spener beginnt jener grosse Eroberungszug der reformirten Kirche
   gegen die lutherische, der seitdem verschiedene Namen, erst
   Frömmigkeit, dann Toleranz, dann Union, dann Conföderation auf sein
   Panier geschrieben hat.'

   the third volume of Heppe's history.

   [605] 80,000 gulden. Augustus was a zealous Lutheran without knowing
   the difference between Lutheranism and Philippism, and supported or
   punished the champions of both parties as he happened to be led or
   misled by his courtiers and the theologians.

   [606] On this remarkable man, see Planck, Vol. VI. pp. 372 sqq.; Heppe,
   Vol. IV. pp. 376 sqq.; G. Frank, Vol. I. p. 219; Hartmann in Herzog,
   Vol. I. p. 312; Johannsen, Jacob Andreæ's Concordistische Thätigkeit,
   in Niedner's Zeitschrift für hist. Theol. 1853, No. 3. Andreæ has often
   been too unfavorably judged. His contemporary opponents called him
   'Schmidlin' (with reference to his father's trade), 'Dr. Jacobellus,
   the Pope of Saxony, the planet of Swabia, the apostle of ubiquity,
   allotrio-episcopus, a worshiper of Bacchus and Mammon,' etc. He no
   doubt had a considerable share of vanity, ambition, and theological
   passion (which he displayed, e.g., against poor Flacius, even after his
   death). But there is no reason to doubt the general purity of his
   motives, and, compared with some other orthodox Lutherans of his age,
   he was even liberal, at least in his earlier years. At a later period
   he denounced the alterations of the Augsburg Confession, and compared
   Melanchthon to Solomon, who at first wrote glorious things, but was
   afterwards so far led astray that the Bible leaves it doubtful whether
   he were saved ('ob er zu unserm Herrgott oder zu dem Teufel gefahren
   sei'). He seemed to be predestinated for the work of his life. Planck
   gives a masterly (though not altogether just) analysis of his
   character, from which I quote a specimen, as it fairly represents the
   spirit and style of his celebrated history (Vol. VI. p. 274): 'In halb
   Deutschland herumzureisen, und an jedem neuen Ort mit neuen Menschen zu
   unterhandlen--hier mit dem Ministerio einer Reichsstadt, und dort mit
   einer kleinen Synode von Superintendenten, welche die Geistlichkeit
   einer ganzen Grafschaft oder eines Fürstenthums repräsentiren--heute
   mit Flacianern und morgen mit Anhängern der Wittenbergischen Schule und
   Verehrern Melanchthons--jetzt mit den Hauptpersonen, die an dem
   gelehrten Streit den vorzüglichsten Antheil genommen, und jetzt mit den
   Schreiern, die bloss den Lärm vermehrt, und dazwischen hinein mit einem
   oder dem andern Stillen im Lande, die bisher im Verborgenen über den
   Streit geseufzt hatten--und allen diesen Menschen alles zu werden, um
   sie zu gewinnen--es gab wirklich kein Geschäft in der Welt, das für ihn
   so gemacht war, wie dieses, so wie es auch umgekehrt wenige Menschen
   gab, die für das Geschäft so gemacht waren, wie er. Nimmt man aber noch
   dies dazu, dass sich auch der gute, Andreæ selbst dazu für gemacht
   hielt, dass in die natürliche Thätigkeit seines Geistes auch zuweilen
   ein kleiner Windzug von Ehrgeiz und Eitelkeit hineinblies, dass er auch
   für den Reiz der bedeutenden Rolle, die er dabei spielen, und des
   Aufsehens, das er erregen würde, nicht unfühlbar war, ja dass selbst
   der Gedanke an das [den] Verkehr, in das er dabei mit so manchen
   Fürsten und Herrn kommen, an die Ehrenbezeugungen, die man ihm hier und
   da erweisen, an die Raths-Deputationen, die ihn in so mancher kleinen
   Reichsstadt bewillkommen, an die Gastpredigten, die man ihm auftragen,
   und an die Ehrfurcht, womit dann die ehrliche Bürger einer solchen
   Stadt, die noch keinen Kanzler von Tübingen gesehen hatten, mit Fingern
   auf ihn weisen würden--dass auch der Gedanke daran den heiteren und
   offenherzigen Mann, der es mil seinen kleinen Schwachheiten nicht so
   genau nahm und sie eben so leicht sich selbst as andern vergab, auf
   gewisse Augenblicke sehr stark anziehen konnte--nimmt man alles diess
   zusammen, so wird man auch hinreichend erklärt haben, wie es kommen
   konnte, dass er vor den Schwierigkeiten seines übernommenen Geschäfts
   nicht erschrak, die sich ihm doch ebenfalls bei seiner Klugheit, bei
   seiner Weltkenntniss, und bei seiner besondern durch manche Erfahrung
   erkauften Kenntniss der Menschen, die er dabei zu bearbeiten hatte,
   lebhafter als hundert andern darstellen mussten. Gewiss standen auch
   diese Schwierigkeiten lebhaft genug vor seiner Seele, aber der Reiz,
   durch den er in das Geschäft hineingezogen wurde, war so stark, dass er
   ihm schwerlich hätte widerstehen können, wenn er nicht nur die Mühe und
   Arbeit, die es ihn kosten, sondern auch den tausendfachen Verdruss, den
   es ihm machen, die zahllosen Kränkungen, die es ihm zuziehen, und
   selbst alle die stechenden Erinnerungen, durch die es ihm sein Alter
   verbittern sollte, vorausgesehen hätte.' Andreæ, in connection with
   Vergerius, founded the first Bible Society, for Sclavonic nations
   (1555). His grandson, Johann Valentin Andreæ (1586-1654), was a man of
   genius and more liberal views, and a great admirer of the order and
   discipline of the Reformed Church in Geneva, which he sadly missed in
   Germany.

   [607] Author of Loci theologici; Examen Concilii Tridentini; Harmonia
   Evangeliorum (completed by Polycarp Leyser and John Gerhard); De duabus
   in Christo naturis, and other works of vast learning. The Romanists
   called him a second Martin Luther, and said: 'Si posterior non fuisset,
   prior non stetisset.' This reminds one of the line, 'Si Lyra non
   lyrasset, Lutherus non saltasset.'

   [608] He prepared the second Latin translation of the Form of Concord,
   and is best known by one of his hymns ('Ach bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu
   Christ,' etc.; although it is only in part from him). His numerous
   theological writings are forgotten. He was a little man with short
   legs, at first a Philippist, then a rigid Lutheran ('parvus Flacius');
   hence in turn attacked by all parties. 'Die Reformirten, gegen die er
   den Vers wandte: "Erhalt uns Herr bei deinem wort und steur' der
   Zwinglianer Mord!" und denen er die Schändung seiner Tochter in letzter
   Instanz zuchreiben zu müssen glaubte, nannten ihn das "Lutheräfflein;"
   bei den strengen Lutheranern hiess er: "Schelmlecker, Seelhenker,
   Seelnecator;" bei den Melanchthonianern: "Judas alter in suspensus,"
   Auch mit seinem Freund Andreæ ist er zuletzt zerfallen. . . . Ein
   Jahrhundert später wurde er unter die deutschen Propheten gerechnet.'

   [609] The remaining three authors were David Chytræus, Professor in
   Rostock (d. 1600), who remained a faithful Melanchthonian, and met the
   violent abuse of the zealots with silence; Andreas Musculus, Professor
   in Frankfort-on-the-Oder (d. 1581), who denounced Melanchthon as a
   patriarch of all heretics, and praised Luther as the sun among the dim
   stars of the old fathers; and Christopher Körner, Professor in
   Frankfort-on-the-Oder, a friend of Chytræus, but unfortunate in his
   children, who sunk into the lowest vices (G. Frank, Vol. I. p. 222).

   § 46. The Form of Concord, Concluded.

   Analysis and Criticism.

   The Formula of Concord consists of two parts--the Epitome and the
   Solida Repetitio et Declaratio. Both treat, in twelve articles, of the
   same matter--the first briefly, the other extensively. They begin with
   the anthropological doctrines of original sin and freedom of the will;
   next pass on to the soteriological questions concerning justification,
   good works, the law and the gospel, the third use of the law; then to
   the eucharist and the person of Christ; and end with foreknowledge and
   election. This order is characteristic of the Lutheran system, as
   distinct from the Calvinistic, which begins with the Scriptures, or
   with God and the eternal decrees. The most important articles are those
   on the Lord's Supper and the Person of Christ, which teach the peculiar
   features of the Lutheran creed, viz., consubstantiation, the
   communication of the properties of the divine nature to the human
   nature of Christ, and the ubiquity of Christ's body.

   The Epitome contains all that is essential. It first states the
   controversy (status controversiæ), then the true doctrine
   (affirmativa), and, last, it condemns the error (negativa). In the
   Solid Repetition and Declaration this division is omitted; but the
   articles are more fully explained and supported by ample quotations
   from the Scriptures, the fathers, the older Lutheran Confessions, and
   the private writings of Dr. Luther, which swell it to about five times
   the size of theEpitome.

   Each part is preceded by an important introduction, which lays down the
   fundamental Protestant principle that the Canonical Scriptures are the
   only rule of faith and doctrine, [617] and fixes the number of (nine)
   symbolical books to be hereafter acknowledged in the Lutheran Church,
   not as judges, but as witnesses and expositions of the Christian faith;
   namely, the three oecumenical Symbols (the Apostles', the Nicene, and
   the Athanasian), the Unaltered Augsburg Confession, [618] the Apology
   of the Confession, the Articles of Smalcald, the Smaller and Larger
   Catechisms of Luther, [619] and the Formula of Concord. The Scriptures
   contain the credenda, the things to be believed; the Symbols the
   credita, the things that are believed. Yet the second part of the
   Formula quotes Dr. Luther, 'piæ sanctoeque memoriæ,' as freely, and
   with at least as much deference to his authority, as Roman Catholics
   quote the fathers. Melanchthon, the author of the fundamental
   Confession of the Lutheran Church, is never named, but indirectly
   condemned; and as to poor Zwingli, he is indeed mentioned, but only to
   be held up to pious horror for his 'blasphemous allæosis.' [620] Thus
   the supremacy of the Bible is maintained in principle, but Luther is
   regarded as its regulative and almost infallible expounder.

   We now proceed to give a summary of the Formula.

   Art. I. Of Original Sin.--It is not the moral essence, or substance, or
   nature of man (as Flacius taught with the old Manichæans), but a
   radical corruption of that nature, which can never be entirely
   eradicated in this world (against the Pelagian and semi-Pelagian
   heresies).

   Art. II. Of Free Will.--Man, in consequence of Adam's fall, has lost
   the divine image, is spiritually blind, disabled, dead, and even
   hostile to God, and can contribute nothing towards his conversion,
   which is the work of the Holy Spirit alone, through the means of grace.
   The Formula, following Luther, uses stronger terms on the slavery of
   the will and total depravity than the Calvinistic Confessions. It
   compares the unconverted man to a column of salt, Lot's wife, a statue
   without mouth or eyes, a dead stone, block and clod, [621] and denies
   to him the least spark of spiritual power. [622] He can not even accept
   the gospel (which is the work of pure grace), but he may reject it, and
   thereby incur damnation.

   This article condemns the fatalism of the Stoics and Manichæans, the
   anthropological heresies of the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians, but also
   and especially the Synergism of Melanchthon and the Philippists. The
   chief framers of the Formula--Andreæ, Chemnitz, Selnecker, and
   Chytræus--were at first in favor of Synergism, which would have been
   more consistent with Article XI.; the Swabian-Saxon Concordia, drawn up
   by Chemnitz and Chytræus, and the Torgau Book actually contained
   synergistic passages. [623] But they were omitted or exchanged for
   others, and consistency was sacrificed to veneration for Luther.

   There is an obvious and irreconcilable antagonism between Art. II. and
   Art. XI. They contain not simply opposite truths to be reconciled by
   theological science, but contradictory assertions, which ought never to
   be put into a creed. The Formula adopts one part of Luther's book De
   servo arbitrio (1525), and rejects the other, which follows with
   logical necessity. It is Augustinian--yea, hyper-Augustinian and
   hyper-Calvinistic in the doctrine of human depravity, and
   anti-Augustinian in the doctrine of divine predestination. It indorses
   the anthropological premise, and denies the theological conclusion. If
   man is by nature like a stone and block, and unable even to accept the
   grace of God (as Art. II. teaches), he can only be converted by an act
   of almighty power and irresistible grace (which Art. XI. denies). If
   some men are saved, without any co-operation on their part, while
   others, with the same inability and the same opportunities, are lost,
   the difference points to a particular predestination and the
   inscrutable decree of God. On the other hand, if God sincerely wills
   the salvation of all men (as Art. XI. teaches), and yet only a part are
   actually saved, there must be some difference in the attitude of the
   saved and the lost towards converting grace (which is denied in Art.
   II.).

   The Lutheran system, then, to be consistent, must rectify itself, and
   develop either from Art. II. in the direction of Augustinianism and
   Calvinism, or from Art. XI. in the direction of Synergism and
   Arminianism. The former would be simply returning to Luther's original
   doctrine, which he never recalled, though he may have modified it a
   little; the latter is the path pointed out by Melanchthon, and adopted
   more or less by some of the ablest modern Lutherans. [624] In either
   case the second article needs modification. It uses the language of
   feeling rather than sober reflection, and gives the rhetorical
   expressions of subjective experience the dignity of symbolical
   statement. We can, indeed, not feel too strongly the sinfulness of sin
   and the awful corruption of our hearts. Nevertheless, God's image in
   man is not lost or exchanged for Satan's image, but only disfigured,
   disabled, and lying in ruins. Man is, indeed, in his prevailing
   inclination, a slave of sin, yet susceptible of the influences of
   divine grace, and remains moral and responsible in accepting or
   rejecting the gospel, before as well as after conversion. His reason,
   his conscience, his sense of sin, his longing for redemption and for
   peace with God, his prayers, his sacrifices, and all the 'testimonia
   animæ naturaliter christianæ,' bear witness with one voice to his
   divine origin, his divine destination, and his adaptation to the
   Christian salvation. [625] But on the other hand there are innumerable
   mysteries of Providence in the order of nature as well as of grace, and
   inequalities in the distribution of gifts and opportunities, which
   baffle solution in this present world, and can only be traced to the
   inscrutable wisdom of God. The human mind has not been able as yet
   satisfactorily to set forth the harmony of God's sovereignty and man's
   responsibility.

   Art. III. Of Justification by Faith.--Christ is our righteousness, not
   according to the divine nature alone (Andrew Osiander), nor according
   to the human nature alone (Stancar), but the whole Christ. God
   justifies us out of pure grace, without regard to antecedent, present,
   or subsequent works or merit, by imputing to us the righteousness of
   the obedience of Christ. Faith alone is the medium and instrument by
   which we apprehend Christ. Justification is a declaratory or forensic
   act--a sentence of absolution from sin, not an infusion of
   righteousness (Osiander).

   Art. IV. Of Good Works.--Good works must always follow true faith, but
   they are neither necessary to salvation (Major), nor dangerous or
   injurious to salvation (Amsdorf). Salvation is of free grace alone,
   apprehended by faith.

   Art. V. Of the Law and the Gospel.--The object of the law is to reprove
   sin and to preach repentance; the gospel (in its specific sense) is a
   joyful message, the preaching of Christ's atonement and satisfaction
   for all sins.

   Art. VI. Of the Third Use of the Law--i.e., its obligation to
   believers, as distinct from its civil or political, and its pædagogic
   or moral use in maintaining order, and leading to a conviction of sin.
   Believers, though redeemed from the curse and restraint of the law, are
   bound to obey the law with a free and willing spirit. Antinomianism is
   rejected.

   Art. VII. Of the Lord's Supper.--The most important controversy and
   chief occasion of the Formula--hence the length of this Article in the
   second part. It sets forth clearly and fully the doctrine of
   consubstantiation (as it is usually called, in distinction from the
   Romish transubstantiation), i.e., of the co-existence of two distinct
   yet inseparable substances in the sacrament. It is the doctrine of the
   real and substantial presence of the true body and blood of Christ in,
   with, and under the elements of bread and wine (in, cum, et sub pane et
   vino), and the oral manducation of both substances by unbelieving as
   well as believing communicants, though with opposite effects. The
   sacramental union of Christ's real body and blood with the elements is
   not an impanation or local inclusion, nor a mixture of two substances,
   nor a permanent (extra-sacramental) conjunction, but it is illocal,
   supernatural, unmixed, and confined to the sacramental transaction or
   actual use. [626] Nor is it effected by priestly consecration, but by
   the omnipotent power of God, and the word and institution of Christ.
   The body of Christ is eaten with the mouth by all communicants, but the
   notion of a Capernaitic or physical eating with the teeth is
   indignantly rejected as a malignant and blasphemous slander of the
   sacramentarians. [627]

   The Formula condemns the Romish dogma of transubstantiation, the
   sacrifice of the mass, and the withdrawal of the cup from the laity,
   but with equal or greater emphasis the Reformed and Melanchthonian
   (Crypto-Calvinistic) theory of a spiritual real presence and fruition
   of Christ by faith, or by believers only, without making a distinction
   between Zwinglians and Calvinists, except that the latter are called
   'the most pernicious of all sacramentarians.' [628]

   Art. VIII. Of the Person of Christ.--This article gives scholastic
   support to the preceding article on the eucharistic presence, and
   contains an addition to the Lutheran creed. It teaches the communicatio
   idiomatum and the ubiquity of Christ's body. It raised the private
   opinions and speculations of Luther, Brentius, and Chemnitz on these
   topics to the authority of a dogma. Some regard this as the crowning
   excellence of the Formula; [629] others, even in the Lutheran
   communion, as its weakest and most assailable point. [630] It was
   certainly very unwise, as history has shown, to introduce the
   scholastic subtleties of metaphysical theology into a public confession
   of faith.

   The Formula derives from the personal union of the two natures in
   Christ (unio hypostatica, or personalis) the communion of natures
   (communio naturarum), from the communion of natures the communication
   of properties or attributes (communicatio idiomatum, a term used first
   by the scholastics), and from the communication of properties the
   omnipresence or ubiquity of Christ's body. The controversy between the
   Lutheran and Reformed, who both professedly stand on the common
   theanthropic Christology of Chalcedon, refers to the nature and extent
   of the communication of properties, and especially to the ubiquity of
   Christ's body derived therefrom.

   The Formula (in the Second Part) distinguishes three kinds of the
   communicatio idiomatum, which were afterwards more fully analyzed,
   defined, and designated by the Lutheran scholastics of the seventeenth
   century. [631]

   1. The genus idiomaticum, by which the attributes of one or the other
   nature are communicated to the whole person. Thus it is said that 'the
   Son of God was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh' (Rom.
   i. 3), that 'Christ was put to death in the flesh,' and that 'he
   suffered in the flesh' (1 Pet. iii. 18; iv. 1). [632] Here Luther's
   warning is quoted against Zwingli's alloeosis, as 'a mask of the
   devil.'

   2. The genus apotelesmaticum, or the koinonia apotelesmaton, [633]
   which has reference to the execution of the office of Christ: the
   communication of redeeming acts of the whole person to one of the two
   natures. Christ always operates in and through both. Thus Christ,
   neither as God nor man alone, but as God-man, is our Mediator,
   Redeemer, King, High-Priest, Shepherd, etc. He shed his blood according
   to his human nature, but the divine nature gave it infinite value (1
   Cor. xv. 3: 'Christ died for our sins;' Gal. i. 4; iii. 17; 1 John iii.
   8; Luke ix. 56).

   3. The genus majestaticum, or auchematicum, [634] i.e., the
   communication of the attributes of the divine nature to the assumed
   humanity of Christ. 'The human nature of Christ,' says the Formula,
   'over and above its natural, essential, and permanent human properties,
   has also received special, high, great, supernatural, inscrutable,
   ineffable, heavenly prerogatives and pre-eminence in majesty, glory,
   power, and might, above all that can be named (Eph. i. 21).' [635] . .
   . 'This majesty of the human nature was hidden and restrained in the
   time of the humiliation. But now, since the form of a servant is laid
   aside, the majesty of Christ appears fully, efficiently, and manifestly
   before all the saints in heaven and on earth, and we also in the life
   to come shall see his glory face to face (John xvii. 24). For this
   reason, there is and remains in Christ only one divine omnipotence,
   power, majesty, and glory, which is the property of the divine nature
   alone; but this shines forth, exhibits, and manifests itself fully, yet
   spontaneously, in, with, and through the assumed, exalted human nature
   in Christ; precisely as to shine and to burn are not two properties of
   iron, but the power to shine and to burn is the property of the
   fire--but since the fire is united with the iron, it exhibits and
   manifests its power to shine and to burn in, with, and through this
   red-hot iron; so that also the red-hot iron, through this union, has
   the power to shine and to burn, without a change of the essence and of
   the natural properties of the fire or of the iron.' [636]

   The Lutheran scholastics make here a distinction between the operative
   attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence) and the quiescent
   attributes (eternity, infinitude): all were communicated to Christ for
   inhabitation and possession, but only the operative for use--chresis,
   usurpatio (Matt. xxviii. 18; John xvii. 2, 5, 27; Col. ii. 3).

   4. Strict logic would require a fourth genus (genus tapeinotikon,
   namely, the communication of the attributes of the human nature to the
   divine nature. But this is rejected by the Formula and the Lutheran
   scholastics, on the ground that the divine nature is unchangeable, and
   received no accession nor detraction from the incarnation. [637] This
   is a palpable inconsistency, [638] and is fatal to the third genus. For
   if there is any real communication of the properties of the two
   natures, it must be mutual; the one is the necessary counterpart of the
   other. If the human nature is capable of the divine, the divine nature
   must be capable of the human; and if, on the other hand, the divine
   nature is incapable of the human, the human nature must be incapable of
   the divine. Luther felt this, and boldly uses such expressions as 'God
   suffered,' 'God died,' which were familiar to the Monophysites. [639]

   The battle-ground between the Lutheran and the Reformed is the genus
   majestaticum, for which John of Damascus had prepared the way. But just
   here the Formula is neither quite clear nor consistent. It was unable
   to harmonize the two different Lutheran Christologies represented among
   the authors by Andreæ and Chemnitz. [640] It teaches, on the one hand
   (to guard against the charge of Eutychianism and Monophysitism), that
   the attributes of the divine nature (as omnipotence, eternity,
   infinitude, omnipresence, omniscience) 'can never become (intrinsically
   and per se) the attributes of the human nature,' and that the
   attributes of the human nature (as corporeality, limitation,
   circumscription, passibility, mortality, hunger, thirst) 'can never
   become the attributes of the divine nature.' [641] (This quite agrees
   with the doctrine of Chemnitz and of the Reformed theologians.) But, on
   the other hand (in opposition to Nestorianism and the
   'sacramentarians,' as the Reformed are called), the Formula asserts
   that, by virtue of the hypostatic or personal union of the two natures
   and the communion of natures, one nature may, nevertheless (by
   derivation and dependency), partake of the properties of the other, or
   at least that the human nature, while retaining its inherent
   properties, may and does receive (as peculiar prerogatives, or as dona
   superaddita) the attributes of divine glory, majesty, power,
   omniscience, and omnipresence. [642] Thus God is really man, and man is
   really God; Mary is truly the mother of God, since she conceived and
   brought forth the Son of God; the Son of God truly suffered, though
   according to the property of his human nature; Christ as man, not only
   as God, knows all things, is able to do all things, is present to all
   creatures, and was so from the moment of the incarnation. For (as the
   Solid Declaration expressly states) Christ, according to his humanity,
   received his divine Majesty 'when he was conceived in the womb and
   became man, and when the divine and human natures were united with each
   other.' That is to say, the incarnation of God was at the same time a
   deification of man in Christ. (This was the Swabian theory of Brentius
   and Andreæ.)

   As regards the ubiquity in particular, the Formula is again
   inconsistent. The Epitome favors the doctrine of the absolute ubiquity
   of Christ's body in all creatures (as taught by Luther, Brentius,
   Andreæ), and says that Christ, 'not only as God, but also as man, is
   present to all creatures . . . is omnipresent, and all things are
   possible and known to him;' the Solid Declaration, on the contrary,
   asserts only the relative ubiquity or multivolipresence (as taught by
   Chemnitz); but neutralizes this again by quoting, with full
   approbation, Luther's strongest passages in favor of absolute ubiquity.
   [643] Hence there arose a fruitless controversy on the subject among
   the orthodox Lutherans themselves, as has been already stated.

   The Formula, therefore, is not a real union of the Swabian and Saxon
   types, but only a series of concessions and counter-concessions, and a
   mechanical juxtaposition of discordant sentences from both parties.
   [644] The later orthodoxy did not settle the question, and both
   theories continued to find their advocates. Moreover, the Formula does
   not answer and refute, but simply denies the objections of the Reformed
   divines, and falls back upon the incomprehensibility of the mystery of
   the hypostatic union, which is declared to be the highest mystery next
   to the Trinity, and the one 'on which our whole consolation, life, and
   salvation depend.'

   As regards the states of humiliation (exinanitio) and exaltation
   (exaltatio), the Formula, in the passages already quoted, teaches the
   full possession (ktesis), and a partial or occult use (kresis), of the
   divine attributes by Christ from the moment of his existence as a man.
   His human nature, and not the divine pre-existent Logos, is understood
   to be the subject of the humiliation in the classical passage Phil. ii.
   7, on which the distinction of two states is based. Consequently the
   two states refer properly only to the human nature, and consist in a
   difference of outward condition and visible manifestation. The
   humiliation is a partial concealment of the actual use (a krupsis
   chreseos) of the divine attributes communicated to the human nature at
   the incarnation; the exaltation is a full manifestation of the same. As
   to the extent of the concealment or actual use, there arose afterwards,
   as we have seen already, a controversy between the Giessen and Tübingen
   divines, but was never properly settled, nor can it be settled on the
   christological basis of the Formula. [645] The modern school of
   Lutheran Kenoticists depart from it by assuming a real
   self-renunciation (kenosis) of the divine Logos in the incarnation, but
   thereby they endanger the immutability of the Deity, and interrupt the
   continuity of the divine government of the world through the Logos
   during the state of humiliation.

   We add some general remarks on the Christology of the Formula, as far
   as it differs from the Reformed Christology. After renewed
   investigation of this difficult problem, I have been confirmed in the
   conviction that the exegetical argument, which must ultimately decide
   the case, is in favor of the Reformed and against the Lutheran theory;
   but I cheerfully admit that the latter represents a certain mystical
   and speculative element, which is not properly appreciated in the
   Calvinistic theology, and may act as a check upon Nestorian tendencies.

   1. The scholastic refinements of the doctrine of the communicatio
   idiomatum, and especially the ubiquity of the body, have no intrinsic
   religious importance, and owe their origin to the Lutheran hypothesis
   of the corporeal presence. [646] They should, therefore, never have
   been made an article of faith. A surplus of orthodoxy provokes
   skepticism.

   2. The great and central mystery of the union of the divine and human
   in Christ, which the Formula desires to uphold, is overstated and
   endangered by its doctrine of the genus majestaticum, or the
   communication of the divine attributes to the human nature of Christ.
   This doctrine runs contrary to the asunchutos and atreptos of the
   Chalcedonian Creed. It leads necessarily--notwithstanding the solemn
   protest of the Formula--to a Eutychian confusion and æquation of
   natures; for, according to all sound philosophy, the attributes are not
   an outside appendix to the nature and independent of it, but inherent
   qualities, and together constitute the nature itself. Or else it
   involves the impossible conception of a double set of divine
   attributes--one that is original, and one that is derived or
   transferred.

   3. The genus majestaticum can not be carried out, and breaks down
   half-way. The divine attributes form a unit, and can not be separated.
   If one is communicated, all are communicated. But how can eternity ab
   ante (anfangslose Existenz), which is a necessary attribute of the
   divine nature of Christ, be really communicated to a being born in
   time, as Jesus of Nazareth undoubtedly was? How can immensity be
   transferred to a finite man? The thing is impossible and contradictory.
   An appeal to God's omnipotence is idle, for God can not sin, nor err,
   nor die, nor do any thing that is inconsistent with his rational and
   holy nature.

   4. The doctrine has no support in the Scriptures; for the passages
   quoted in its favor speak of the divine human person, not of the human
   nature of Christ; as, 'I am with you alway;' 'all power is given to
   me;' [647] 'in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge;' 'in Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
   bodily.' And as to the state of humiliation, such passages as Luke ii.
   52; Mark xiii. 32; Heb. v. 8, 9, are inconsistent with the teaching of
   the Formula that he was omniscient as man from the mother's womb.

   5. The Christology of the Formula makes it impossible to construct a
   truly human life of our Lord on earth, and turns it into a delusive
   Christophany, or substitutes a crypto-pantheistic Christ for a
   personal, historical Christ.

   6. The familiar illustrations of the iron and fire, and body and soul,
   used by the Formula, favor the Reformed rather than the Lutheran
   theory; for the iron does not transfer its properties to the fire, nor
   the fire to the iron; neither are the spiritual qualities of the soul,
   as cognition and volition, communicated to the body, nor the material
   properties and functions of the body, as weight and extension, eating
   and drinking, to the soul: both are indeed most intimately and
   inseparably connected--the soul dwells in the body, and the body is the
   organ of the soul--but both remain essentially distinct. The same is
   the case with the other illustration which is borrowed from the
   intercommunication or inhabitation (perichoresis, immanentia,
   permeatio, circumincessio) of the persons of the Holy Trinity; for the
   peculiar properties (idia, idiotetes) of the persons are not
   communicated or transferred--paternity and being unbegotten (agennesia)
   belongs to the Father alone, sonship (gennesia, filiatio) to the Son
   alone, and procession (ekporeusis, processio) to the Holy Ghost alone.

   7. The ubiquity of the body is logically necessary for the hypothesis
   of consubstantiation, and both stand and fall together. For the
   eucharistic multipresence must be derived either from a perpetual
   miracle (performed through the priestly consecration, or by the power
   of the Holy Ghost, both of which the Lutherans reject), [648] or from
   an inherent quality of the body itself, which enables it to be present
   wherever and whenever it is actually partaken of by the mouth of the
   communicants.

   8. But ubiquity proves too much for consubstantiation by extending the
   eating of Christ to every meal (though this is inconsistently denied),
   and depriving the eucharistic presence of all specific value. Yea, it
   is fatal to it, and leads, we will not say to the Calvinistic, but
   rather to a crypto-pantheistic theory of the eucharist; [649] for a
   body which is intrinsically and perpetually omnipresent must be so
   spiritual that it can only be spiritually present and spiritually be
   partaken of by faith. [650]

   9. Ubiquity is not only unscriptural, but antiscriptural, and conflicts
   with the facts of Christ's local limitations while on earth, his
   descent into Hades, his forty days after the resurrection, his
   ascension to heaven, his visible return to judgment. We freely admit
   that Christ's glorified body is not subject to the laws of earthly
   substances or confined to a particular locality; it is a 'spiritual'
   body (comp. 1 Cor. xv.), with its own laws of rest and locomotion,
   which transcend our present knowledge; nevertheless it is and ever
   remains a body, as real as the resurrection body of saints which will
   be fashioned like unto it (summorphon to somati tes doxes autou), and
   as heaven itself is real, from which Christ will return 'in like
   manner' as the apostles 'saw him go into heaven.' The ubiquitarian
   exegesis here runs into an ultra-Zwinglian spiritualism to save the
   literalism with which it started. But, feeling its own weakness, it
   falls back again at last upon the literal understanding of the esti in
   the words of institution.

   10. This first and last resort of consubstantiation is given up by the
   ablest modern exegetes, [651] who agree in the following decisive
   results: (a) That the disputed word esti was not even spoken by our
   Lord in Aramaic, and can have no conclusive weight, (b) That the
   substantive verb may designate a symbolical as well as a real relation
   between the subject and the predicate, as is evident from the nature of
   the case and from innumerable passages of Scripture, (c) That in this
   case the literal interpretation would lead to transubstantiation rather
   than the semi-figurative (synecdochical) consubstantiation; since
   Christ does not say what the Lutheran hypothesis would require: 'This
   is my body and bread,' 'This is my blood and wine (or in, with, and
   under the bread and wine).' (d) That the figurative or metaphorical
   interpretation (whether in the Zwinglian or Calvinistic sense) is made
   necessary in connection with the touto for houtos, poterion for oinos,
   or aima, as well as by the surroundings of the institution of the
   Lord's Supper, viz.: the nature of the typical passover, the living,
   personal presence of our Lord, with his body still unbroken and his
   blood still unshed, which could not be literally eaten and drunk by his
   disciples.

   This, of course, only settles the exegetical basis, and still leaves
   room for different doctrinal views of this sacred ordinance, into which
   we can not here enter. [652]

   11. The Lutheran doctrine of the eucharist overlooks the omnipresence
   of the Holy Spirit, and substitutes for it the corporeal presence of
   Christ. It is the Holy Spirit who brings the believer in and out of the
   sacrament into a living union and communion with the whole Christ, and
   makes the perpetual virtue and efficacy of his crucified body on the
   cross, i.e., his atoning sacrifice, and of his glorified body in
   heaven, available for our spiritual benefit.

   12. Finally, as regards the two states of Christ, the Reformed
   Christology is right in making the pre-existent Logos (Logos asarkos)
   the subject of the kenosis, or self-humiliation, instead of the human
   nature (or the Logos ensarkos), which was never before en morphe theou,
   and consequently could not renounce it in any way. The incarnation
   itself is the beginning of the humiliation. In this interpretation of
   Phil. ii. 7 the Reformed Church is sustained not only by Chrysostom and
   other fathers, but also by the best modern exegetes of all
   denominations, including Lutherans. [653]

   Art. IX. Of Christ's Descent into Hell..--The fact of a real descent of
   the whole person of Christ, the God-man, after his death, into the real
   hell (not a metaphorical hell, nor the grave, nor the limbus patrum) is
   affirmed, and its object defined to be the defeat of Satan and the
   deliverance of believers from the power of death and the devil; but all
   curious questions about the mode are deprecated and left for the world
   to come.

   Art. X. Of Church Usages and Ceremonies, called Adiaphora.--The
   observance of ceremonies and usages neither commanded nor forbidden in
   the Word of God, should be left to Christian freedom, but should be
   firmly resisted when they are forced upon us as a part of divine
   service (Gal. ii. 4, 5; v. 1; Acts xvi. 3; Rom. xiv. 6; 1 Cor. vii. 18;
   Col. ii. 16).

   This article was a virtual condemnation of Melanchthon's course in the
   Interim controversy.

   Art. XI. Of God's Foreknowledge and Election.--No serious controversy
   took place on this doctrine in the Lutheran Church, except at Strasburg
   between Zanchi and Marbach (1561). The rigid predestinarianism of
   Luther and the Flacianists quietly gave way to the doctrine of the
   universality of divine grace, while yet the anthropological premises of
   the Augustinian system were retained (in Art. I. and II.).

   The Formula teaches that there is a distinction between foreknowledge
   (præscientia, prævisio, Vorsehung, Matt. x. 29; Psa. cxxxix. 16; Isa.
   xxxvii. 28) and foreordination (prædestinatio, electio, ewige Wahl,
   Eph. i. 5); that foreknowledge pertains alike to the good and the evil,
   and is not the cause of sin and destruction; that foreordination refers
   only to the children of God; that this predestination of the elect is
   'eternal, infallible, and unchangeable,' and is the ultimate and
   unconditional cause of their salvation; that God, though he elects only
   a portion, sincerely desires all men to be saved, and invites them by
   his Word to the salvation in Christ; that the impenitent perish by
   their own guilt in rejecting the gospel; that Christians should seek
   the eternal election, not in the secret but in the revealed will of
   God, and avoid presumptuous and curious questions.

   Thus the particularism of election and the universalism of vocation,
   the absolute inability of fallen man (Art. II.), and the guilt of the
   unbeliever for rejecting what he can not accept, are illogically
   combined. The obvious contradiction between this article and the second
   has already been pointed out. [654]

   The authors felt the speculative difficulties of this dogma, and
   emphasized the practical side, which amounts to this: that believers
   are saved by the free grace of God, while unbelievers are lost by their
   own guilt in rejecting the grace sincerely offered to them. Later
   Lutheran divines, like John Gerhard, labored hard to show that God not
   only sincerely desires the salvation of all men alike, but that he also
   actually gives an opportunity to all men even in this present life.
   [655] But the argument fails with regard to the heathen, who form the
   greatest part of the race even to this day (not to speak of the world
   before Christ): and hence the Lutheran view of the actual universality
   of the offer of grace necessitates an essential change of the orthodox
   doctrine of the middle state, as far as those are concerned who never
   heard of the gospel in this world.

   Art. XII. Of Several Heresies and Sects.--This article rejects the
   peculiar tenets of the Anabaptists, Schwenkfeldians, New Arians, and
   Antitrinitarians, who never embraced the Augsburg Confession.

   To the second part of the Formula there is added a Catalogue of
   Testimonies from the Scriptures and the fathers (Athanasius, Gregory
   Nazianzen, Cyril of Alexandria, John of Damascus) concerning the divine
   majesty of the human nature of Christ, in support of the doctrine of
   the communicatio idiomatum, as taught in Art. VIII. This Appendix was
   prepared by Andreæ and Chemnitz; but it has no symbolical authority,
   and is often omitted from the Book of Concord. [656]

   RECEPTION, AUTHORITY, AND INTRODUCTION. [657]

   The Form of Concord, as it is the last, is also the most disputed of
   the Lutheran symbols. It never attained general authority, like the
   Augsburg Confession or Luther's Catechism, although far greater
   exertions were made for its introduction.

   It was adopted by the majority of the Lutheran principalities and state
   churches in Germany; [658] also by the state church of Sweden, the
   Lutherans in Hungary, and several Lutheran synods in the United States.
   [659]

   On the other hand, it was rejected by a number of Lutheran Princes and
   cities of the empire, [660] and by King Frederick II. of Denmark. [661]

   Some countries of Germany, where it had been first introduced, rejected
   it afterwards, but remained Lutheran; [662] while others, in
   consequence of the doctrinal innovations and exclusiveness of the
   Formula, passed over to the Reformed Confession. [663] It is a
   significant fact, that the successors of the three Electors, who were
   the chief patrons and signers of the Formula, left the Lutheran Church:
   two became Reformed, and one (the King of Saxony) a Roman Catholic.

   OPPOSITION AND DEFENSE.. [664]

   The Formula gave rise to much controversy. It was assailed from
   different quarters by discontented Lutherans and Philippists, [665]
   Calvinists, [666] and Romanists. [667]

   The chief objection was to the new dogma of ubiquity.

   The Lutherans attacked, according to their stand-point, either the
   concessions to the Swabian scheme of absolute ubiquity, or the absence
   of a direct condemnation of Melanchthon and other heretics, or the
   rejection of the Flacian theory of original sin, or the condemnation of
   Synergism. The last point could be made very plausible, since the chief
   authors of the Formula, Andreæ, Chemnitz, and Selnecker, had at first
   been decided synergists. Chytræus remained true at least to his love
   and admiration for Melanchthon, which subjected him to the suspicion of
   Crypto-Philippism and Calvinism. [668]

   The Reformed, led by Ursinus (chief author of the Heidelberg
   Catechism), justly complained of the misrepresentations and unfair
   condemnation of their doctrine under the indiscriminate charge of
   sacramentarianism, [669] and explained the qualified sense in which the
   Reformed signed the Augsburg Confession in the sense of its author,
   with wholesome strictures on the unprotestant overestimate of the
   authority of Luther. They exposed with rigid logic the doctrinal
   contradiction between Arts. II. and XI., quoted Luther's views on
   predestination against the Formula, and refuted with clear and strong
   arguments the new dogma of ubiquity, which is contrary to the
   Scriptures, the oecumenical creeds, and sound reason, and destructive
   of the very nature of the sacrament as a communion of the body of
   Christ; for if the body is omnipresent, and there can be but one
   omnipresence, it must be present like God himself, i.e. like a spirit,
   every where whole and complete, without parts and members, and thus the
   lineaments and concrete image of Christ are lost. Sadeel pointed out
   the palpable inconsistency between the hyperphysical and
   ultrasupernatural outfit of Christ's body for the eucharistic presence,
   on the one hand, and the emphasizing of a corporeal presence and oral
   manducation on the other, as if this were the main thing in the
   sacrament, while the communion of the believing soul with the person of
   Christ was almost lost sight of. [670]

   Strange to say, the Roman Catholics were just as decidedly opposed to
   ubiquity, though otherwise much nearer the Lutheran doctrine of the
   sacraments. Bellarmin, the greatest controversialist of Rome, exposes
   the absurdity of a dogma which would destroy the human nature of
   Christ, and involve the presence of his body in uteris omnium
   feminarum, imo etiam virorum, and the presence extra uterum from the
   moment of conception, and in utero after the nativity. In his polemic
   work against Protestantism he urges five arguments against ubiquity,
   [671] viz.: (1.) It abolishes the sacramental character of the
   eucharist. (2.) It leads to the Calvinistic spiritual presence and
   spiritual eating by faith--the very error of the sacramentarians which
   this Lutheran dogma was to overthrow. [672] (3.) It destroys the
   specific effect of the eucharist, and makes it useless. (4) It is
   refuted by the other Lutheran doctrine which confines the presence to
   the time of the use of the sacrament. [673] (5.) It is a makeshift to
   evade the power of priestly consecration which creates the eucharistic
   presence. [674]

   Outside of Germany and Switzerland the Formula of Concord excited
   little or only passing polemical interest. Queen Elizabeth endeavored
   to prevent its adoption because it condemned the Reformed doctrine, and
   threatened to split and weaken the Protestants in their opposition to
   the united power of Rome. She sent delegates to a convention of
   Reformed Princes and delegates held at Frankfort-on-the-Main, Sept
   1577. [675] The Anglican divines of the sixteenth century rejected
   ubiquity as decidedly as the Continental Calvinists. [676] Evangelical
   Episcopalians hold the Reformed view of the sacraments; and as to
   modern Anglo-Catholic and Ritualistic Episcopalians, they greatly
   prefer the Romish or Greek dogma of transubstantiation to the Lutheran
   consubstantiation. [677]

   The attacks upon the Formula, especially those proceeding from
   Lutherans and the Palatinate divines, could not be ignored in silence.
   Chemnitz, Selnecker, and Kirchner, by order of the three electoral
   patrons of the work, convened at Erfurt, [678] Oct. 23,1581 (afterwards
   at Braunschweig and Quedlinburg), and prepared, with much labor and
   trouble, an elaborate 'Apology,' called the 'Erfurt Book,' in four
   parts. [679] It called forth new attacks, which it is unnecessary here
   to follow.

   LATER FORTUNES.

   During the palmy period of Lutheran scholasticism the Formula of
   Concord stood in high authority among Lutherans, and was even regarded
   as inspired. [680] Its first centennial (1680) was celebrated with
   considerable enthusiasm. [681] But at the close of another century it
   was dead and buried. The Pietists, and afterwards the Rationalists,
   rebelled against symbololatry and lifeless orthodoxy. One stone after
   another was taken down from the old temple, until it was left a
   venerable ruin. Those very countries where subscription to creeds had
   been most rigorously enforced, suffered most from the neological
   revolution.

   Then followed a period of patient research and independent criticism,
   which led to a more impartial estimate. Planck, the ablest Lutheran
   historian of the Formula, with complete mastery of the sources,
   followed the leading actors into all the ramifications and recesses of
   their psychological motives, political intrigues, and theological
   passions, and represents the work as the fabrication of a theological
   triumvirate, which upon the whole did more harm than good, and which
   produced endless confusion and controversy. [682] Köllner, another
   learned and impartial Lutheran, concedes to it higher merit for the
   past, but no dogmatic significance for the present, except in the
   article on predestination. [683] Heppe, the indefatigable historian of
   the German post-Reformation period, from a vast amount of authentic
   information, carries out the one-sided idea that the Lutheranism of the
   Formula is an apostasy from the normal development of German
   Protestantism, by which he means progressive, semi-Reformed, unionistic
   Melanchthonianism. [684] Even Kahnis thinks that the Lutheran theology
   of the future must be built on the Melanchthonian elements which were
   condemned by the Formula. [685]

   With the modern revival of orthodoxy, the Formula enjoyed a partial
   resurrection among Lutherans of the high sacramentarian type, who
   regard it as the model of pure doctrine and the best summary of the
   Bible. By this class of divines it is all the more highly esteemed,
   since they make doctrine the corner-stone of the Church and the
   indispensable condition of Christian fellowship. In America, too, the
   Formula has recently found at least one able and scholarly advocate in
   the person of Dr. Krauth, of Philadelphia. [686]

   Yet the great body of the Lutheran Church will never return to the
   former veneration for this symbol. History never repeats itself. Each
   age must produce its own theology. Even modern Lutheran orthodoxy in
   its ablest champions is by no means in full harmony with the Formula,
   but departs from its anthropology and Christology, and makes
   concessions to Melanchthon and the Reformed theology, or attempts a new
   solution of the mighty problems which were once regarded as finally
   settled. [687]

   AN IMPARTIAL ESTIMATE.

   The Formula of Concord is, next to the Augsburg Confession, the most
   important theological standard of the Lutheran Church, but differs from
   it as the sectarian symbol of Lutheranism, while the other is its
   catholic symbol. Hence its authority is confined to that communion, and
   is recognized only by a section of it. It is both conclusive and
   exclusive, a Formula of Concord and a Formula of Discord, the end of
   controversy and the beginning of controversy. It completed the
   separation of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches, it contracted the
   territory and the theology of Lutheranism, and sowed in it the seed of
   discord by endeavoring to settle too much, and yet leaving unsettled
   some of the most characteristic dogmas. It is invaluable as a
   theological document, but a partial failure as a symbol, just because
   it contains too much theology and too little charity. It closes the
   productive period of the Lutheran reformation and opens the era of
   scholastic formalism.

   The Formula is the fullest embodiment of genuine Lutheran orthodoxy, as
   distinct from other denominations. It represents one of the leading
   doctrinal types of Christendom. It is for the Lutheran system what the
   Decrees of Trent are for the Roman Catholic, the Canons of Dort for the
   Calvinistic. It sums up the results of the theological controversies of
   a whole generation with great learning, ability, discrimination,
   acumen, and, we may add, with comparative moderation. It is quite
   probable that Luther himself would have heartily indorsed it, with the
   exception, perhaps, of a part of the eleventh article. The Formula
   itself claims to be merely a repetition and explication of the genuine
   sense of the Augsburg Confession, and disclaims originality in the
   substance of doctrine. [688] But there were two diverging tendencies
   proceeding from the same source. The author of the Confession himself
   understood and explained it differently, and the Formula added new
   dogmas which he never entertained. It excludes, indeed, certain
   extravagances of the Flacian wing of Lutheranism, but, upon the whole,
   it is a condemnation of Philippism and a triumph of exclusive
   Lutheranism. [689]

   The spirit of Melanchthon could be silenced, but not destroyed, for it
   meant theological progress and Christian union. It revived from time to
   time in various forms, in Calixtus, Spener, Zinzendorf, Neander, and
   other great and good men, who blessed the Lutheran Church by protesting
   against bigotry and the overestimate of intellectual orthodoxy, by
   insisting on personal, practical piety, by widening the horizon of
   truth, and extending the hand of fellowship to other sections of
   Christ's kingdom. The minority which at first refused the Formula
   became a vast majority, and even the recent reaction of Lutheran
   confessionalism against rationalism, latitudinarianism, and unionism
   will be unable to undo the work of history, and to restore the Lutheran
   scholasticism and exclusivism of the seventeenth century. The Lutheran
   Church is greater and wider than Luther and Melanchthon, and, by its
   own principle of the absolute supremacy of the Bible as a rule of
   faith, it is bound to follow the onward march of Biblical learning.

   The great length of this section may be justified by the intrinsic
   importance of the Formula Concordiæ, and the scarcity of reliable
   information in English works. [690]

   the Altered Augsburg Confession (of 1540), if it be understood as
   teaching another doctrine of the Lord's Supper.

   Bible), 'darin alles begriffen, was in heiliger Schrift weitläuftig
   gehandelt, und einem Christenmenschen zu wissen vonnöthen ist.'

   allæosis Zwinglii,' which Dr. Luther condemned 'als des Teufels Larve,
   bis in den Abgrund der Höllen.'

   [621] Solida Declaratio, Art. II. § 24 (p. 662 ed. Rech., p. 534 ed.
   Müller): 'Autequam homo per Spiritum Sanctum illuminatur, convertitur,
   regeneratur et trahitur . . . ad conversionem aut regenerationem suam
   nihil inchoare, operari, aut coöperari potest, nec plus quam lapis,
   truncus, aut limus (so wenig als ein Stein oder Block oder Thon)'.
   Thomasius und Stahl disapprove of these expressions, and Luthardt
   (Lehre v. freien Willen, p. 272) admits, at least, that they are
   unfortunately chosen (unglücklich gewählt). Fr. H. R. Frank defends
   them.

   [622] Ibid. Art. II. § 7 (p. 656 ed. Rech., p. 589 ed. Müller): . . .
   'homo ad bonum prorsus corruptus et mortuus sit, ita ut in hominis
   natura post lapsum ante regenerationem ne scintillula quidem
   spiritualium virium (nicht ein Fünklein der geistlichen Kräfte) reliqua
   manserit aut restet, quibus ille ex se ad gratiam Dei præparare se aut
   oblatam gratiam apprehendere, aut eius gratiæ (ex sese et per se) capax
   esse possit, aut se ad gratiam applicare aut accommodare, aut viribus
   suis propriis aliquid ad conversionem suam vel ex toto vel ex dimidia
   vel ex minima parte conferre, agere, operari aut coöperari (ex se ipso
   tanquam ex semet ipso) possit (oder aus seinen eigenen Kräften etwas zu
   seiner Bekehrung, weder zum ganzen noch zum halben oder zu einigem dem
   wenigsten oder geringsten Theil, helfen, thun, wirken oder mitwirken
   vermöge, von ihm selbst, als von ihm selbst). . . . Inde adeo naturale
   tiberum arbitrium, ratione corruptarum virium et naturæ suæ depravatæ,
   duntaxat ad ea, quæ Deo displicent et adversantur, activum et efficax
   est.' This and similar statements are followed by quotations from Dr.
   Luther, where he compares the natural man to 'a column of salt, Lot's
   wife, a clod and stone, a dead statue without eyes or mouth.' All he
   said against Erasmus, and later, in his Commentary on Genesis, about
   free will, is indorsed. Flacius inferred from the same teacher his
   Manichæan error, which the Formula condemns in Art. I.

   [623] See these passages in Gieseler, Vol. IV. p. 486, note 24; Heppe,
   Der Text der Bergischen Concordienformel verglichen, etc.; Luthardt,

   [625] Well says Goethe--

   'Wär' nicht das Auge sonnenhaft,

   Wie könnte en das Licht erblicken!

   Lebt' nicht in uns des Gottes eigne Kraft,

   Wie könnt' uns Göttliches entzücken?'

   [626] 'Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum, seu actionem
   divinitus institutam' (Sol. Decl. p. 663). Gerhard and the later
   Lutheran theologians describe the presence as sacramentalis, vera et
   realis, substantialis, mystica, supernaturalis et incomprehensibilis,
   and distinguish it from the præsentia gloriosa (in heaven), hypostatica
   (of the logos in the human nature), spiritualis (operativa, or
   virtualis), figurativa (imaginativa, symbolica). It is a parousia, not
   an apousia (absence), nor enousia (inexistence), nor sunousia
   (co-existence in the sense of coalescence), nor metousia
   (transubstantiation). They reject the term consubstantiation in the
   sense of impanation or incorporation into bread, or physical
   coalescence and fusion. The Formula itself does not use the term.

   [627] And yet Dr. Luther himself unequivocally taught the literal
   mastication of Christ's body. He gave it as the sum of his belief, to
   which he 'would adhere though the world should collapse,' that Christ's
   body was 'ausgetheilt, gegessen und mit den Zähnen zerbissen' (Briefe,
   ed. by De Witte, Vol. IV. p. 572, comp. p. 569). He instructed
   Melanchthon to insist on this in the conference he had with Bucer in
   Cassel, Dec. 1534; but Melanchthon, though not emancipated from
   Luther's view at that time, declined to shoulder it as his own, and
   began to change his ground on the eucharistic question. Corp. Ref. Vol.
   II. p. 822. Comp. Schmidt, Mel. p. 319; Ebrard, Abendmahl, Vol. II. pp.
   375 sqq.

   [628] Planck (Vol. VI. pp. 732 sqq.) charges the Formula with willful
   misrepresentation of Calvin's view, which he had so clearly,
   distinctly, and repeatedly set forth, especially in his tracts against
   Westphal, and which had since been embodied in the Confessions of the
   Reformed churches. Thomasius, Stahl, and other orthodox Lutherans,
   freely admit the material difference between Calvin and Zwingli in the
   theory of the eucharist.

   [629] My friend, Dr. Krauth, goes so far as to say (1.c. p. 316): 'The
   doctrine of the person of Christ presented in the Formula rests upon
   the sublimest series of inductions in the history of Christian
   doctrine. In all confessional history there is nothing to be compared
   with it in the combination of exact exegesis, of dogmatic skill, and of
   fidelity to historical development. Fifteen centuries of Christian
   thought culminate in it.' But in his lengthy exposition he does not
   even mention the important difference between the Swabian and Saxon
   schools, nor the various forms of the communicatio idiomatum, and
   evades the real difficulty by resolving, apparently (p. 318), the
   communication of divine properties into an efficacious manifestation of
   the Godhead in and through the assumed humanity of Christ--which has
   never been disputed by Reformed divines.

   [630] Even Luthardt admits at least the artificial construction of the
   Christology of the Formula, and its inconsistency with the historical
   realness of the picture of Christ in the Gospels (Compend. der
   Dogmatik, p. 144; comp. also Kahnis, Luth. Dogmatik, Vol. III. p. 338
   sq.). The modern Lutheran Kenoticists, Thomasius, Hofmann (Luthardt
   inclines to them, p. 155)--not to speak of the extreme form to which
   Gess carried the kenosis--virtually depart from the Formula of Concord,
   which pronounces it a 'blasphemous perversion' to explain Matt. xxviii.
   18 ('all power is given to me,' etc.) in the sense that Christ had ever
   laid aside or abandoned his almighty power in the state of humiliation
   (Epit., at the close of Art. VIII.).

   [631] We anticipate, for the sake of clearness, from the later orthodox
   writers the names of the three genera. The substance is already in the
   Formula, and in the treatise of Chemnitz, De duabus naturis in Christo,
   1580. For a fuller exposition, with ample quotations from Chemnitz,
   John Gerhard, Hafenreffer, Hutter, Calov, Quenstedt, König, Baier,
   Hollaz, see Heinrich Schmid's Dogmatik der evang. lutherischen Kirche
   (2d ed. 1847), pp. 252 sqq.; comp. also Luthardt, pp. 144 sqq., and
   Kahnis, Vol. II. pp. 335 sqq.

   [632] This genus was subsequently subdivided into three species,
   corresponding to the concretum of the divine nature, the concretum of
   the human nature, and the concretum of both natures, of which the
   idiomata are predicated, viz., (a) idiopoiesis, or oikeisis, i.e.,
   'appropriatio, quando idiomata humana de concreto divinæ naturæ
   enuntiantur,' Acts iii. 15; xx. 28; 1 Cor. ii. 8; Gal. ii. 20; Psa.
   xlv. 8. (b) Koinonia ton theion, 'divinorum idiomatum, quando de
   persona verbi incarnati, ab humana natura denominata, idiomata divina
   ob unionem personalem enuntiantur,' John vi. 62; viii. 58; 1 Cor. xv.
   47. (c) Antidosis, or sunamphoterismos, 'alternatio s. reciprocatio,
   qua tam divina quam humana idiomata de concreto personæ sive de
   Christo, ab utraque natura denominato, prædicantur,' Heb. xiii. 8; Rom.
   ix. 5; 2 Cor. xiii. 4; 1 Pet. iii. 18. See Schmid, p. 258.

   [633] 'The expression is borrowed from John of Damascus. apotelesma
   means properly completion of the work (consummatio operis), effect,
   result; but it is here used for each action in the threefold office of
   Christ.

   [634] From auchema, gloria. This genus is also called beltiosis,
   huperupsosis, metadosis, theosis, apotheosia, theopoiesis, unctio.

   [635] Sol. Decl. Art. VIII. p. 685 (ed. Müller).

   [636] P. 689.

   [637] Sol. Decl. p. 684: 'Was die göttliche Natur in Christo anlanget,
   weil bei Gott keine Veränderung ist (Jac. 1,17), ist seiner göttlichen
   Natur durch die Menschwerdung an ihrem Wesen und Eigenschaften nichts
   ab-oder zugegangen, ist in oder für sich dadurch weder gemindert noch
   gemehret.' This raises the question how far the unchangeableness of God
   is affected by the incarnation, about which Dr. Dorner has written some
   profound articles in the Jahrbücher für Deutsche Theologie, 1856 and
   1858.

   [638] As Thomasius and Kahnis (Vol. III. p. 339) admit.

   [639] 'Weil Gottheit und Menschheit,' he says (Vol. XXX. p. 204, Erl.
   ed.), 'Eine Person ist, so giebt die Schrift um solcher persönlichen
   Einigkeit willen auch alles, was der Menschheit widerfährt, der
   Gottheit, und wiederum. Und ist auch also in der Wahrheit. Denn da
   musst du ja sagen: Die Person leidet, stirbt; nun ist die Person
   wahrhaftiger Gott: durum ist's recht geredet: Gottes Sohn leidet.'

   [640] See above, pp. 290-294.

   [641] Epit. VIII. (p. 545, ed. Müller): 'Wir gläuben, lehren und
   bekennen, dass die göttliche und menschliche Natur nicht in ein Wesen
   vermenget, keine in die andere verwandelt, sondern ein jede ihre
   wesentliche Eigenschaften behalte, Welche der andern Natur
   Eigenschaften Nimmermehr Werden. Die Eigenschaften göttlicher Natur
   sind: allmächtig, ewig, etc., sein, welche der menschlichen Natur
   Eigenschaften nimmermehr werden. Die Eigenschaften menschlicher Natur
   sind: ein leiblich Geschöpf oder Creatur sein, etc., welche der
   göttlichen Natur Eigenschaften nimmermehr werden.' Comp. the Sol. Decl.
   Art. VIII.

   [642] Epit. VIII. (p. 545): 'Sondern hie ist die höchste Gemeinschaft,
   welche Gott mit dem Menschen wahrhaftig hat, aus welcher persönlichen
   Vereinigung und der daraus erfolgenden höchsten und unaussprechlichen
   Gemeinschaft alles herfleusst, was menschlich von Gott, und göttlich
   vom Menschen Christo gesaget und gegläubet wird; wie solche Vereinigung
   und Gemeinschaft der Naturen die alten Kirchenlehrer durch die
   Gleichniss eines feurigen Eisens, wie auch der Vereinigung Leibes und
   der Seelen im Menschen erkläret haben.' The Sol. Decl. repeats the same
   at greater length.

   [643] The words ' dass Christus auch nach und mit seiner assumirten
   Menschheit gegenwärtig sein könne und auch sei, wo er will,' clearly
   express the multivolipræsentia of Chemnitz and the Saxons.
   Nevertheless, Chemnitz, to his own regret, could not prevent the
   wholesale indorsement and quotation of Luther's views--that wherever
   Christ's divinity is, there is also his humanity; that he may be and is
   in all places wherever God is; that the ascension is figurative; that
   the right hand of God is every where, etc. Hence it is scarcely correct
   when Kahnis says (Vol. II. p. 581) that the compromise of the Formula
   leans to the side of Chemnitz. Compare the thorough discussion of
   Dorner, Entwicklungsgeschichte, Vol. II. pp. 710 sqq., who clearly
   shows that Chemnitz made several fatal concessions to the Swabian
   Christology. Hence the opposition of Heshusius and the Helmstädt
   Lutherans (see p. 293).

   [644] Dorner, Vol. II. p. 771, 'Die Vermittlungsversuche des I. Andreæ
   und Chemnitz erreichten in Betreff des eigentlichen Gegensatzes
   zwischen den Schwaben und Niederdeutschen keine innere Einigung,
   sondern nur eine Vereinigung van disharmonischen Sätzen von beiden
   Seiten her in einem Buch. Die Folge war daher nicht Eintracht, sondern
   vielseitige Zwietracht.'

   [645] The Formula teaches the ktesis with a partial kenosis chreseos,
   and so far seems to favor the later Giessen view, although the issue
   was not yet fairly before the authors. Sol. Decl. Art. VIII. (p. 767
   ed. Rech., p. 680 ed. Müller): 'Eam vero majestatem statim in sua
   conceptione etiam in utero matris habuit, sed ut apostolus loquitur
   (Phil. ii. 7), se ipsum exinanivit, eamque, ut D. Lutherus docet, in
   statu suæ humiliationis secreto habuit, neque eam semper, sed quoties
   ipsi visum fuit, usurpavit.' An occasional use of the divine attributes
   during the state of humiliation was expressly conceded by the Giessen
   divines; they only denied the constant and full (though secret) use
   contended for by the Tübingen school. See above, p. 295. The Lutheran
   scholastics were more on the side of the Giessen divines.

   [646] This is admitted, in part at least, by Dr. Stahl, one of the
   ablest and most clear-headed modern champions of orthodox Lutheranism,
   when he says: 'Die Lehre von der Allgegenwart des Leibes Christi ist,
   abgesehen von der Anwendung auf das Abendmahl, von gar keinem
   religiösen Interesse' (Die lutherische Kirche und die Union, Berlin,
   1859, p. 185).

   [647] It is objected that omnipotence could not be given to the divine
   person of Christ, who had it from eternity essentially and of
   necessity, but only to his human nature. But this reasoning implies a
   virtual denial of the kenosis, or laying aside of the pre-existent
   glory which Christ had as God, and was going to take possession of
   again as God-man at his exaltation, John xvii. 5 (doxason me . . . te
   doxe e eichon pro tou ton kosmon einai para soi).

   [648] According to the Romish liturgy, the elements are literally
   changed or transubstantiated into the very body and blood of Christ by
   the consecration of the priest when he repeats the words of
   institution, Hoc est corpus meum; and hence the priest is blasphemously
   said to create the body of Christ. But, according to the Oriental and
   Greek liturgies, the presence of the body and blood of Christ is
   effected by the Benediction or Invocation of the Holy Ghost, which
   follows the recital of the words of institution. Calvin and the
   Reformed liturgies likewise bring in the agency of the Holy Ghost, but
   simply for conveying the energy or the power and effect of the body and
   blood of Christ in heaven to the believing communicant.

   [649] The Roman Catholic Bellarmin (see below) and Reformed polemics
   (also Steitz on Ubiquity, in Herzog's Encykl.) argue that the ubiquity
   dogma destroys the Lutheran corporeal presence, and logically ends in
   the Calvinistic theory of the spiritual real presence. But we would
   rather say that it ends in a crypto-panchristism, which is quite
   foreign to Calvin. The doctrine of ubiquity was, before Luther, always
   connected with a leaning to Gnosticism and Pantheism, as in Origen and
   Scotus Erigena.

   [650] The Lutherans exclude all ideas of local extension or expansion
   from the body of Christ, and describe it just as the scholastics and
   the ancient philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Philo) describe the
   presence of incorporeal substances, and especially of the Deity itself,
   which is 'unextended,' 'indistant,' 'devoid of magnitude,' not part of
   it here and part of it there, but whole and undivided every where and
   nowhere. See Cudworth's Intellectual System of the Universe, Harrison's
   ed. (Lond. 1845), Vol. III. p. 248.

   [651] Including such unbiased philological commentators as De Wette and
   Meyer. See especially Meyer on Matthew xxvi. 26 (pp. 548 sqq. of the
   5th ed.), and my annotations to Lange on Matthew, Am. ed., pp. 470-474.
   Kahnis, who formerly wrote an elaborate historical work in defense of
   the Lutheran doctrine (Die Lehre vom Abendmahl, Lipz. 1851), has more
   recently (1861) arrived at the conclusion that 'the Lutheran
   interpretation of the words of institution must be given up,' though he
   thinks that this affects only the Lutheran theology, not the Lutheran
   faith.

   [652] I have briefly expressed my own view in Com. on Matthew, p. 471:
   . . . 'But we firmly believe that the Lutheran and Reformed views can
   be essentially reconciled, if subordinate differences and scholastic
   subtleties are yielded. The chief elements of reconciliation are at
   hand in the Melanchthonian-Calvinistic theory. The Lord's Supper is:
   (1.) A commemorative ordinance, a memorial of Christ's atoning death,
   and a renewed application of the virtue of his broken body and shed
   blood. (This is the truth of the Zwinglian view, which no one can deny
   in the face of the words of the Saviour: 'Do this in remembrance of
   me.') (2.) A feast of living union of believers with the ever-living,
   exalted Saviour, whereby we truly, though spiritually, receive Christ
   with all his benefits, and are nourished by his life unto life eternal.
   (This was the substance for which Luther contended against Zwingli, and
   which Calvin retained, though in a different scientific form, and in a
   sense rightly confined to believers.) (3.) A communion of believers
   with one another as members of the same mystical body of Christ. . . .
   It is a sad reflection that the ordinance of the Lord's Supper--this
   feast of the unio mystica and communio sanctorum, which should bind all
   pious hearts to Christ and each other, and fill them with the holiest
   and tenderest affections--has been the innocent occasion of the
   bitterest and most violent passions and the most uncharitable abuse.
   The eucharistic controversies are among the most unrefreshing and
   apparently fruitless in church history. Theologians will have much to
   answer for at the judgment-day for having perverted the sacred feast of
   divine love into an apple of discord. No wonder that Melanchthon's last
   wish and prayer was to be delivered from the rabies theologorum.
   Fortunately, the blessing of the holy communion does not depend upon
   the scientific interpretation and understanding of the words of
   institution, but upon the promise of the Lord, and upon childlike faith
   which receives it, though it may not fully understand the mystery of
   the ordinance. Christians celebrated it with most devotion and profit
   before they contended about the true meaning of those words, and
   obscured their vision by all sorts of scholastic theories and
   speculations. Fortunately, even now Christians of different
   denominations and holding different opinions can unite around the table
   of their common Lord and Saviour, and feel one with him and in him who
   died for them all, and feeds them with his life once sacrificed on the
   cross, but now living forever. Let them hold fast to what they agree
   in, and charitably judge of their differences; looking hopefully
   forward to the marriage supper of the Lamb in the kingdom of glory,
   when we shall understand and adore, in perfect harmony, the infinite
   mystery of the love of God in his Son our Saviour.'

   [653] See, especially, Meyer (who ably defends the patristic and
   Reformed exegesis against the objections of De Wette and Philippi), and
   Braune on Phil. ii. 6 sqq. (Am. ed. of Lange). The latter says: 'hos of
   has for its antecedent Christo Iesou, and points to his ante-mundane
   state, as verses 7 and 8 refer to his earthly existence, and verses
   9-11 refer to his subsequent glorified condition. The subject is the
   Ego of the Lord, which is active in all the three modes of existence.
   It is the entire summary of the history of Jesus, including his
   ante-human state.' Among the dogmatic theologians of the Lutheran
   Church, Liebner, Thomasius, Kahnis, Gess, and others, give up the old
   Lutheran exegesis of the passage. Kahnis (in the third volume of his
   Luth. Dogmatik, 1868, p. 341) makes, as the result of his earnest
   investigation, the following clear and honest statement: '(a) Dass
   Paulus in der Offenbarungsgeschichte Jesu Christi drei Stadien
   unterscheidet: das Stadium der Gottesgestalt, da der Logos beim Vater
   war; das Stadium der Knechtsgestalt, das mit der Selbstverleugnung
   Christi in der Menschwerdung begann und zur Erniedrigung am Kreuze
   fortging; das Stadium der Erhöhung, da im Namen Christi sich alle Knie
   beugen und ihn als Herrn bekennen. (b) Dass das Subjekt der
   Erniedrigung der logos asarkos ist, wie schon die alte Kirche in ihren
   namhaftesten Lehrern sah, die reformirten Theologen richtig erkannten
   und auch die bedeutendsten neueren Ausleqer aller Confessionen
   zugestehen, das Subjekt der Erhöhung aber der logos ensarkos. (c) Dass
   die Entäusserung (eauton ekeuose) darin besteht, dass der Logos sich
   der Gottesgestalt (morphe theou) d. h. des Herrlichkeitsstandes beim
   Vater begab, um Knechtsgestalt (morphe doulou) anzunehmen, d.h. ein
   Mensch wie wir zu werden, ja als Mensch sich zum Kreuzestode zu
   erniedrigen (etapeinosen eauton): Entäusserung also gleich
   Menschwerdung ist. Darnach fordert dieses Lehrstück eine andere
   Fassung, als die alte [Luther.] Dogmatik ihm gab.'

   [654] See above, p. 314. Comp. also Dorner, Gesch. der Prot. Theol.
   pp.366 sqq. Planck (Vol. VI. p. 814) charges this article with a
   confusion not found in the other parts of the Formula, and Gieseler
   (Vol. IV. p. 488) with putting together contradictory positions; while,
   on the other hand, Thomasius (Das Bekenntniss der ev. luth. Kirche,
   etc. p. 222) sees here only supplementary truths to be reconciled by
   theological science, and Guericke (in his Kirchengeschichte, Vol. III.
   p. 419) calls the logical inconsistency of the Formula 'divinely
   necessitated' (eine göttlich nothwendige Verstandes-Inconsequenz).

   [658] The Preface of the Book of Concord is signed by eighty-six names
   representing the Lutheran state churches in the German empire; among
   them are three Electors (Louis of the Palatinate, Augustus of Saxony,
   and John George of Brandenburg), twenty Dukes and Princes, twenty-four
   Counts, thirty-five burgomasters and counselors of imperial cities. The
   Formula was also signed by about 8000 pastors and teachers under their
   jurisdiction, including a large number of ex-Philippists and
   Crypto-Calvinists, who preferred their livings to their theology; hence
   Hutter was no doubt right when he admitted that many subscribed mala
   conscientia. Yet no direct compulsion seems to have been used. See
   Köllner, p. 551, and Johannsen, Ueber die Unterschriften des
   Concordienbuches, in Niedner's Zeitschrift für histor. Theologie, 1847,

   Synod (see p. 224).

   into the chimney-fire. See Köllner, p. 575 sq.; Gieseler, Vol. IV. p.
   493, note 54; and Heppe, Vol. IV. pp. 275 sqq. Nevertheless the
   document afterwards gained considerable currency in Denmark.

   [662] So the Duchy of Brunswick recalled the subscription in 1583. Duke
   Julius, one of the most zealous promoters of the Form of Concord,
   became alienated for personal reasons, because he was severely blamed
   by Chemnitz and several Princes for allowing one of his sons to receive
   Romish consecration (Dec. 5, 1578), and two others the tonsure, to the
   great scandal of Protestantism. He was afterwards strengthened by the
   doctrinal opposition of Heshusius and the Helmstädt Professors, who
   rejected the Formula for teaching absolute ubiquity. The Corpus
   doctrinæ Julium was retained in Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel. See Planck,
   Vol. VI. pp. 667 sqq., and especially Heppe, Vol. IV. pp. 203 sqq.
   These Brunswick troubles brought about an alienation between Andreæ
   (who labored to reconcile the Duke) and Chemnitz (who was deposed by
   the Duke). In a widely circulated letter of April 8, 1580, Chemnitz
   compared Andreæ to a fawning and scratching cat ('cum coram longe aliud
   mihi dicas, wie die Katzen, die vorne lecken und hinten kratzen').
   Heppe, p. 214.

   [663] So the Palatinate, which, after a short Lutheran interregnum of
   Louis, readopted the Heidelberg Catechism under John Casimir (1583),
   Anhalt (1588), Zweibrücken (1588), Hanau (1596), Hesse (1604), and
   especially Brandenburg under John Sigismund (1614). In this respect the
   Formula of Concord inflicted great territorial loss upon the Lutheran
   denomination. The greatest loss was the Palatinate and the Electoral,
   afterwards the royal house of Brandenburg and Prussia.

   Concord in Walch, Feuerlin, and Köllner. Comp. also Hutter, Conc. conc.

   251-266. Hutter sees in the general attack of 'the devil and his
   organs, the heretics,' against the Formula, a clear proof that it was
   composed instinctu Spiritus Sancti, and is in full harmony with the
   infallible Word of God (p. 976).

   consists of twelve chapters, and is very able. Extract in Sudhoff,
   Olevianus und Ursinus, pp. 432-452; comp. Schweizer in Herzog, Vol. X.
   pp. 263-265. Ursinus and some of his pupils defended this work against
   the Lutheran 'Apology,' in Defensio Admonitionis Neost. contra Apologiæ
   Erfordensis sophismata, Neost. 1584. Beza wrote Refutatio dogmatis de
   ficticia carnis Christi omnipræsentia; Dansæus an Examen of Chemnitz's
   book De duabus in Christo naturis, Genev. 1581; Sadeel, a very able
   tract, De veritate humanæ naturæ Christi, 1585 (in his Opera, Genev.
   1592). Of later Reformed writings must be mentioned the Emdensche Buch
   (1591), and especially Hospinian's Concordia discors (1607), which
   called forth Hutter's Concordia concors (1614).

   [667] The ablest Roman assailant was Robert Bellarmin: Judicium de
   libro quem Lutherani vocant Concordiæ, Ingolst. 1587, 1589, etc. (in
   his Opera, Col. Ag. 1620, Vol. VII. p. 576). Against him Hoe ab Hoenegg
   wrote Apol. contra R. B. impium et stolidum judicium, Fref. 1605.
   Bellarmin also repeatedly notices the Christology of the Formula in his
   great controversial work against Protestantism. See below.

   [668] See Schütz, Vita Chytræi, and Heppe, Vol. IV. pp. 395 sqq.

   [669] This complaint the Erfurt Apology of the Formula of Concord
   admitted to be just, at least in part. The Formula makes no distinction
   between Zwingli and Calvin; condemns Zwingli's 'allæosis' (by which he
   meant only to guard against a confusio and æquatio naturarum) as a mask
   of the devil; charges the Reformed generally with a Nestorian
   separation of the two natures in Christ, and a denial of all communion
   between them; with childish literalism concerning the right hand of God
   and the throne of glory; with shutting Christ up in heaven, as if he
   had no more to do with us, etc.

   [670] Dorner, in his History of Christology (Vol. II. pp. 718-750),
   gives an admirable and impartial summary of the Reformed argument. Dr.
   Kahnis, of Leipzig, from his Lutheran standpoint, thus fairly and
   liberally characterizes the Reformed opposition to the Form of Concord
   (Luth. Dogm. Vol. II. p. 590): 'Die Reformirten vertraten den
   Standpunkt des Verstandes, welcher zwischen Endlichem und Unendlichem
   abstract(?) scheidend (finitum non est capax infiniti) der menschlichen
   Natur Christi keinen Antheil an den göttlichen Eigenschaften einräumt;
   den Standpunkt der Realität, welcher in der Betrachtung der Person
   Christi, von dem Wandel auf Erden ausgehead, der rein menschlichen
   Entwicklung Christi freien Raum schaffen will; den Standpunkt des
   Praktischen, der bei den sicheren Thatsachen der persönlichen
   Vereinigung Beruhigung fasste, ohne sich in gnostisch-scholastische
   Theorien verspinnen zu wollen.'

   and Lib. III. de Christo (where he refers to the views of Luther,

   [672] His reasoning is curious: 'Quod est ubique, non potest moveri,
   nec transire de loco ad locum; ergo licet corpus Christi sit in pane,
   tamen non manducatur, cum panis manducatur, quia non movetur, nec
   transit cum pane e manu ad os, et ab ore ad stomachmn; nam etiam antea
   erat in ore et in stomacho, priusquam panis eo veniret. . . . Sequitur
   aut esse inanem cænam Domini, aut saltem spiritualiter sumi per
   energiam et per fidem, et solum a piis, qui habent fidem, et hoc est,
   quod volunt Calvinistæ.'

   [673] 'Si enim corpus Christi ubique est, erit etiam ante usum in vane.

   [674] Bellarmin (De Sacr. Euch. Lib. III. c. 7), after quoting
   Augustine against the sententia ubiquistarum Lutheranorum, thus defines
   the Roman view: 'Nos fatemur Christi corpus non esse ubique diffusum;
   et ubicunque est, habere suam formam et partium situm, ac
   dispositionem; quamvis hæc figura, forma, dispositio partium in cælo
   conspiciatur, ubi locum replet; in Sacramento autem sit quidem, sed non
   repleat locum, nec videri a nobis possit.'

   [676] Cranmer was at first inclined to the Lutheran, theory, but gave
   it up afterwards. His fellow-Reformers held the Zwinglian or
   Calvinistic view. Bishop Hooper thus speaks of ubiquity: 'Such as say
   that heaven and the right hand of God is in the articles of our faith
   taken for God's power and might, which is every where, they do wrong to
   the Scripture and unto the articles of our faith. They make a confusion
   of the Scripture, and leave nothing certain. They darken the simple and
   plain verity thereof with intolerable sophisms. They make heaven hell,
   and hell heaven, turn upside down and pervert the order of God. If the
   heaven and God's right hand, whither our Saviour's body is ascended, be
   every where, and noteth no certain place, as these uncertain men teach,
   I will believe no ascension. What needeth it?--seeing Christ's body is
   every where with his Godhead. I will interpret this article of my creed
   thus: Christus ascendit ad dextram Patris. Patris dextra est ubique:
   ergo Christus ascendit ad ubique. See what erroneous doctrine followeth
   their imaginations!' Early Writings of John Hooper, D.D., Lord Bishop
   of Gloucester and Worcester, Martyr, 1555; ed. by the Parker Society,
   Cambridge, 1843, p.66. The 'Declaration of Christ and his Office,' from
   which this passage is taken, was first published at Zürich. 1547, in
   the early stage of the ubiquitarian controversy. See also the Remains

   das Dogma wie für die äusseren Verhältnisse der Kirche nur der wenigste

   [686] Dr. Krauth calls the Formula 'the amplest and clearest confession
   in which the Christian Church has ever embodied her faith,' and he goes
   so far as to say: 'But for the Formula of Concord, it may be questioned
   whether Protestantism could have been saved to the world' (Conservative
   Reform. p. 302). And this in full view of the independent Protestantism
   in Switzerland, France, Holland. England, and Scotland, which
   materially differs from the distinctive theology of this book, and was
   in vain condemned by it!

   [687] We can simply allude to the internal differences of the Erlangen,
   Leipzig, and Rostock schools of Lutherans; to Luthardt on the freedom
   of the will; to Thomasius on the Kenosis; to Kahnis on the Lord's
   Supper, inspiration, and the canon of the Scripture; to the Hofmann and
   Philippi controversy on the atonement; to Hengstenberg's articles on
   justification and the Epistle of James; to the disputes on the
   millenarian question; and to the controversy on Church government and
   the relation of the ministry to the general priesthood of believers, in
   which Huschke, Stahl, Kliefoth, Vilmar, and Löhe take High-Church
   ground against the Low-Church views of Höfling, Harless, Diedrich, etc.
   Some of these controversies, especially the question of the ministerial
   office (Amtsfrage), are also disturbing the peace of the orthodox
   Lutherans in America, and divide them into hostile synods (the Missouri
   Synod versus the Grabau Synod, Iowa Synod, and portions of the General
   Council, not to mention several subdivisions). The eschatological
   controversy separates the Iowa Synod from Grabau and the Missourians,
   who denounce millenarianism as a heresy. The smallest doctrinal
   difference among orthodox Lutherans in America is considered sufficient
   to justify the formation of a new synod with close-communion
   principles. And yet all these Lutherans adopt the Formula Concordiæ as
   the highest standard of pure Scripture orthodoxy. Is this Concordia
   concors, or Concordia discors?

   [688] See the Preface. An able argument for this agreement is presented
   by Prof. Thomasius, of Erlangen, in his Das Bekenntniss der
   evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche in der Consequent seines Princips,
   Nürnberg, 1848. He develops the doctrines of the Formula from Luther's
   doctrine of justification by faith as the organic life-principle of the
   Lutheran Church. But the Lutheran doctrine of the eucharist with the
   communicatio idiomatum and ubiquity of the body have--as the creeds of
   the Reformed churches prove--no necessary connection with justification
   by faith; and on these points, which constitute the peculiar features
   of the Formula, the author of the Augsburg Confession himself
   represented, even before Luther's death, a different line of
   development.

   [689] Andreæ, in a letter to Heshusius and Wigand, of July 24, 1576,
   giving an account of the results of the Torgau Convention (quoted by
   Heppe, Vol. III. p. 111), thus characteristically sets forth the object
   of the whole movement in which he and the Elector Augustus were the
   chief leaders: 'Hoc enim sancte vobis affirmare et polliceri ausim,
   Illust. Electorem Saxoniæ in hoc unice intentum, ut Lutheri Doctrina
   partim obscurata, partim vitiata, partim aperte vel occulte damnata,
   pura et sincera in scholis et Ecclesiis restituatur, adeoque Lutherus,
   hoc est Christus, cuius fidelis minister Lutherus fuit, vivat. Quid
   vultis amplius? Nihil hic fucatum, nihil palliatum, nihil tectum est,
   sed juxta spiritum Lutheri, qui Christi est.' And Chemnitz wrote, June
   29, 1576: 'Mentio librorum Philippi expuncta est, et responsione hoc in
   parte retulimus nos ad Lichtenbergense decretmn.' Some zealots, like
   Heshusius, desired that Melanchthon should be condemned, by name, in
   the Formula, but Andreæ thought it better 'to cover the shame of Noah,'
   and to be silent about the apostasy of the Lutheran Solomon. Dr.
   Krauth, too, says (Conservative Reform. p. 327): 'The Book of Concord
   treats Melanchthon as the Bible treats Solomon. It opens wide the view
   of his wisdom and glory, and draws the veil over the record of his
   sadder days.' In the Formula itself he is nowhere named, but in the
   Preface to the 'Book of Concord' his writings are spoken of as 'utilia
   neque repudianda ac damnanda, quatenus cum ea norma, quæ Concordiæ
   libro expressa est, per omnia consentiunt.'

   [690] There is no full and satisfactory account of the history and
   character of the Form of Concord in the English language, except in Dr.
   Krauth's Conservative Reformation and its Theology, pp. 288-328; and
   this, in accordance with the aim of this learned and able author, is
   apologetic and polemic rather than historical. Dr. Shedd, in his
   valuable History of Christian Doctrine (Vol. II. p. 458), devotes only
   a few lines to it. Dr. Fisher, in his excellent work on the Reformation
   (N. Y. 1873), disposes of it in a foot-note (p. 481). In Dr. Blunt's
   Dictionary of Sects, etc. (London, 1874), it has no place among the
   Protestant Confessions, and the brief allusion to it sub 'Lutherans,'
   p. 269, only exposes the ignorance of the writer. The doctrines of the
   Form of Concord are frequently, though mostly polemically, noticed in
   Dr. Hodge's Systematic Theology (N.Y. 1873, 3 vols.).

   Augsburg Confession of 1540) the Confessio Saxonica, pp. 407-483, and
   the Confessio Würtembergica, pp. 491-554.

   ed. Bretschneider and Bindseil, Vol. XXVIII. (Brunsvigæ, 1860), pp.
   329-568. This vol. contains the Latin and German texts of the Conf.
   Saxonica with critical Prolegomena.

   The Book of Concord embraces all the Lutheran symbols which are still
   in force; but two other Confessions deserve mention for their
   historical importance, viz., the Saxon Confession and the Würtemberg
   Confession.

   Both were written in 1551, twenty-one years after the Confession of
   Augsburg and twenty-six years before the Formula of Concord, in full
   agreement with the former as understood by its author, and without the
   distinctive and exclusive features of the latter. Both were intended
   (like the Articles of Smalcald) for the Roman Catholic Council, and,
   although they failed in accomplishing their direct object, they exhibit
   the doctrinal status of the Lutheran or the entire Evangelical Church
   of Germany at that period. It is this Protestantism which received
   legal toleration and recognition in the German Empire by the Treaty of
   Passau, 1552, and three years afterwards, without the restriction as to
   time, at the Diet of Augsburg. [691] But in the succeeding generation
   the exclusive and more energetic school of Lutheranism prevailed, and
   found its expression in the Formula of Concord, which superseded those
   interimistic Confessions.

   1. The Saxon Confession (Confessio Saxonica) was drawn up by
   Melanchthon for the Council of Trent, which, after a brief transfer to
   Bologna by Paul III., in March, 1547, was again convened at Trent by
   Julius III., May 1, 1551. The German Emperor had previously (Feb. 13)
   invited the Protestant States to send delegates, promising them full
   protection, and his best endeavor to secure 'a Christian, useful
   reformation, and abrogation of improper doctrines and abuses.'
   Melanchthon expected nothing from a conference with Bishops and
   Cardinals, but considered it wise and politic to accept the Emperor's
   invitation, provided he would secure to the Protestant delegates a
   hearing before the Council. His advice was the best that could be given
   under the circumstances, and was accepted by Elector Maurice of Saxony.
   [692] He was requested to prepare a 'Repetition and Exposition of the
   Augsburg Confession,' usually called the 'Saxon Confession.' [693] To
   finish this work with more leisure, he went with his friend Camerarius
   to the Prince of Anhalt at Dessau.

   The document is not merely a repetition of the Augsburg Confession, but
   an adaptation of it to the changed condition of affairs. In 1530
   Melanchthon still hoped for a reunion with Rome, and wrote in an
   apologetic tone, avoiding all that might irritate the powerful enemy;
   now all hope of reunion had departed, and Protestantism had made a
   decided progress in ecclesiastical consolidation and independence.
   Although the Confession was composed after the defeat of the Protestant
   Princes by the Emperor, and in the midst of the Adiaphoristic troubles,
   it shows no disposition whatever to recede from the doctrinal positions
   taken at Augsburg; on the contrary, the errors and abuses of Rome,
   which made separation an imperative duty, are freely exposed and
   refuted. The Scriptures, as understood by the ancient Church in the
   oecumenical Creeds, are declared to be the only and unalterable
   foundation of the Evangelical faith. [694] The distinctive Evangelic
   doctrines and usages in opposition to Rome are comprehended under the
   two articles of the Apostles' Creed: 'I believe the forgiveness of
   sins,' and 'one holy Catholic Church.' The former excludes human merit
   and justification by works; the latter the political and secular
   conceptions and corruptions of the Church, which is represented to be a
   spiritual though visible communion of believers in Christ. The
   controverted articles are considered in twenty-three sections, in the
   order of the Augsburg Confession, namely: Original Sin, Forgiveness and
   Justification, Free Will, Good Works, New Obedience, the Church, the
   Sacraments, Satisfaction, Marriage, Monastic Life, Invocation of
   Saints, Civil Magistrate. The Saxon Confession is signed, not by
   Princes, as the Augsburg Confession was, but, as Melanchthon suggested,
   only by theologians, viz., Bugenhagen, Pfeffinger, Camerarius, Major,
   Eber, Melanchthon, and the Superintendents of Electoral Saxony, who
   convened at Wittenberg, July 9, for the purpose, and unanimously
   adopted the work of their dear and venerable 'Preceptor,' as the clear
   expression of their own faith in full harmony with his Confession of
   1530. It was a beautiful moment in Melanchthon's life, for which he
   felt very grateful to God. [695] The danger was now much greater than
   in 1530, for the Elector Maurice was in league with the victorious
   Emperor. The theologians of Brandenburg, Ansbach, Baireuth, Mansfeld,
   Pomerania, Palatinate, Hesse, Würtemburg, and Strasburg likewise sent
   in their consent to this Confession. [696]

   The Council convened in May, 1551, was adjourned to October, and again
   to January next. Melanchthon was ordered to proceed to Trent, but to
   stop at Nuremberg for further instructions. While at Nuremberg, in
   January, 1552, he wrote a preface to Luther's Commentary on Genesis,
   and expressed himself very decidedly against the preceding acts of the
   Council. [697] In the mean time the Saxon and Würtemberg
   lay-embassadors received a hearing at Trent, not, indeed, before the
   whole Council in public session, but before a private congregation.
   They requested that the members of the Council be released of their
   oath of obedience to the Pope, and be free to decide the questions by
   the rule of the Scriptures alone. A few prelates were inclined to
   accede, but the majority would never have sacrificed the principle of
   tradition, nor reconsidered the decrees already adopted. The Saxon
   embassadors urged Melanchthon to proceed on his journey, but he delayed
   on account of the rumors of war. The treacherous Elector Maurice of
   Saxony cut the Gordian knot by making war upon his ally, the Emperor,
   in the spring, 1552, drove him from Innspruck, scared the fathers of
   Trent to their homes, and achieved, in the Treaty of Passau (Aug. 2,
   1552), ratified at Augsburg (1555), the first victory for liberty of
   conscience to Protestants, to which the Emperor reluctantly yielded,
   and against which the Pope never ceases to protest.

   II. The Würtemberg Confession (Confessio Würtembergica) [698] Was
   prepared for the same purpose, at the same time and in the same spirit,
   by Brentius, the Reformer of the Duchy of Würtemberg, in the name of
   his Prince, Duke Christopher, who likewise resolved to send delegates
   to the Council of Trent. For Brentius, like Melanchthon, had no
   confidence in this partial popish Council, but advised, nevertheless,
   compliance with the Emperor's request, since a refusal might be
   construed as disobedience and contempt, or as an act of cowardice. The
   Confession was approved by a commission of ten Swabian divines, and by
   the City of Strasburg. It was also approved at Wittenberg, as agreeing
   with Melanchthon's Confession. It was found best to send two
   Confessions, one representing the Evangelical Churches of the North,
   the other those of the South of Germany, to avoid the appearance of a
   conspiracy.

   The Würtemberg Confession contains a preface of Duke Christopher, and
   restates, in thirty-five articles, the doctrines of the Augsburg
   Confession and other controverted points, for the purpose of showing
   that the Evangelical Churches agree with the pure doctrine of the
   apostles, and of the catholic and orthodox Church. [699] On the Lord's
   Supper this Confession goes a little beyond the Saxon; but there is no
   trace of the ubiquity of Christ's body, of which Brentius, ten years
   afterwards, became a zealous advocate.

   Brentius was among the Würtemberg and Strasburg delegates to Trent, and
   actually arrived there, March 18, 1552, but only to return in April
   without accomplishing any thing. [700] It is very doubtful whether he
   and Melanchthon would have made a deep impression upon the Council,
   which was already committed to the cause of popery and had sanctioned
   some of its most obnoxious doctrines.

   The Four Articles of Visitation of Electoral Saxony owe their origin to
   the revival and second overthrow of Crypto-Calvinism, and reflect the
   fierceness and bitterness of this contest. [701] They continued in
   force till the present century, but never extended their authority
   beyond Saxony. They are strongly anti-Calvinistic, and may be regarded
   as an Appendix to the Formula of Concord, with which they fully agree.

   They were written in 1592, and first published in German in 1593. [702]
   Their object was to perpetuate the reign of exclusive Lutheranism. They
   are based on the articles of a Colloquy between Andreæ and Beza at
   Mömpelgard (1586). The chief author was Dr. Aegidius Hunnius, one of
   the foremost Lutheran divines of his age, a native of Winnenden in the
   Duchy of Würtemberg, professor of theology at Marburg (1576-1592), and
   afterwards at Wittenberg (d. 1603). [703] He was commissioned with
   several others to visit the churches and schools of Saxony for the
   purpose of suppressing every trace of Crypto-Calvinism. All clergymen
   and teachers, and even the civil officers, were required to subscribe
   the four Articles or lose their places. A great feast of thanksgiving
   closed the visitation.

   The hardest fate was reserved for Chancellor Crell, who, after ten
   years' imprisonment, was executed (1601), ostensibly for political
   offenses, but really for opinions which were once honored by the name
   of Philip Melanchthon. The preachers who attended this auto-da-fé of
   hyper-Lutheran orthodoxy told Crell that by his wicked Calvinism he had
   caused in many cases a dangerous delay of infant baptism, undermined
   the authority of the ministry, and deserved the fire of hell. They
   laughed at his prayer on the scaffold; whereupon he prayed to God not
   to change their laughter into weeping. The executioner, holding the
   severed head high up in the air, said: 'This was a Calvinistic stroke.'
   [704]

   The four Articles give a very clear and explicit summary of those
   peculiar doctrines which distinguish the Lutheran creed from those of
   all other Protestant churches. The first refers to the Lord's Supper,
   and teaches the real presence and oral fruition of the true and natural
   body of Christ by all communicants. The second treats of the Person of
   Christ, and teaches, in support of the eucharistic omnipresence, the
   communication of the attributes whereby the human nature of Christ
   became partaker of the whole majesty, honor, power, and glory of his
   divine nature. The third teaches baptismal regeneration and the
   ordinary necessity of baptism for salvation. [705] The fourth teaches
   the universal atonement, and the vocation of all men to salvation, with
   the possibility of a total and final fall from grace.

   In the negative part the opposite doctrines of the Calvinists are
   rejected. These were henceforth held in perfect abhorrence in Saxony,
   and it was a common proverb, 'Rather a Papist than a Calvinist.' [706]

   As the Articles are a very clear and succinct statement of the specific
   doctrines of Lutheranism as opposed to Calvinism, and not easy of
   access, they are here given in full:

   Articulus I.

   De Sacra Coena.

   pura et vera doctrina nostrarum ecclesiarum de sacra coena.

   I. Quod, verba Christi: 'Accipite et comedite, hoc est corpus meum:
   Bibite, hic est sanguis meus,' simpliciter, et secundum literam, sicut
   sonant, intelligenda sint.

   II. Quod in Sacramento duæ res sint, quæ exhibentur et simul
   accipiuntur: una terrena, quæ est panis et vinum; et una coelestis, quæ
   est corpus et sanguis Christi.

   III. Quod hæc Unio, Exhibitio et Sumptio fiat hic inferius in terris,
   non superius in coelis.

   IV. Quod exhibeatur et accipiatur verum et naturale corpus Christi,
   quod in cruce pependit, et verus ac naturalis sanguis, qui ex Christi
   latere fluxit.

   V. Quod corpus et sanguis Christi non fide tantum spiritualiter, quod
   etiam extra Coenam fieri potest, sed cum pane et vino oraliter, modo
   tamen imperscrutabili et supernaturali, illic in Coena accipiantur,
   idque in pignus et certificationem resurrectionis nostrorum corporum ex
   mortuis.

   VI. Quod oralis perceptio corporis et sanguinis Christi non solum fiat
   a dignis, verum etiam ab indignis, qui sine poenitentia et vera fide
   accedunt; eventu tamen diverso. A dignis enim percipitur ad salutem, ab
   indignis autem ad judicium.

   Articulus II.

   De Persona Christi.

   pura et vera doctrina nostrarum ecclesiarum de hoc articulo, de persona
   christi.

   I. In Christo sunt duæ distinctæ Naturæ, divina et humana. Hæ manent in
   æternum inconfusæ et inseparabiles (seu indivisæ).

   II. Hæ duæ Naturæ personaliter ita sunt invicem unitæ, ut unus tantum
   sit Christus, et una Persona.

   III. Propter hanc personalem Unionem recte dicitur, atque in re et
   veritate ita se habet, quod Deus Homo, et Homo Deus sit, quod Maria
   Filium Dei genuerit, et quod Deus nos per proprium suum sanguinem
   redemerit.

   IV. Per hanc Unionem personalem, et quæ eam secuta est, exaltationem,
   Christus secundum carnem ad dexteram Dei collocatus est, et accepit
   omnem potestatem in coelo et in terra, factusque est particeps omnis
   divinæ majestatis, honoris, potentiæ et gloriæ.

   Articulus III.

   De Baptismo.

   pura et vera doctrina nostrarum ecclesiarum de hoc articulo s.
   baptismatis.

   I. Quod unum tantum Baptisma sit, et una ablutio, non quæ sordes
   corporis tollere solet, sed quæ nos a peccatis abluit.

   II. Per Baptismum tanquam lavacrum illud regenerationis et renovationis
   Spiritus Sancti salvos nos facit Deus et operatur in nobis talem
   justitiam et purgationem a peccatis, ut qui in eo foedere et fiducia
   usque ad finem perseverat, non pereat, sed habeat vitam æternam.

   III. Omnes, qui in Christum Jesum baptizati sunt, in mortem ejus
   baptizati sunt, et per Baptismum cum ipso in mortem ejus consepulti
   sunt, et Christum induerunt.

   IV. Baptismus est lavacrum illud regenerationis, propterea, quia in eo
   renascimur denuo et Spiritu Adoptionis obsignamur ex gratia (sive
   gratis).

   V. Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et Spiritu, non potest introire in
   regnum coelorum. Casus tamen necessitatis hoc ipso non intenditur.

   VI. Quicquid de carne nascitur, caro est, et natura sumus omnes filii
   iræ divinæ: quia ex semine peccaminoso sumus geniti, et in peccatis
   concipimur omnes.

   Articulus IV.

   De Prædestinatione et æterna Providentia Dei.

   pura et vera doctrina nostrarum ecclesiarum de hoc articulo.

   I. Quod Christus pro omnibus hominibus mortuus sit, et ceu Agnus Dei
   totius mundi peccata sustulerit.

   II. Quod Deus neminem ad condemnationem condiderit, sed velit, ut omnes
   homines salvi fiant et ad agnitionem veritatis perveniant, propterea
   omnibus mandat, ut Filium suum Christum in Evangelio audiant, et per
   hunc auditum promittit virtutem et operationem Spiritus Sancti ad
   conversionem et salutem.

   III. Quod multi homines propria culpa pereant: alii, qui Evangelium de
   Christo nolunt audire, alii, qui iterum excidunt gratia, sive per
   errores contra fundamentum, sive per peccata contra conscientiam.

   IV. Quod omnes peccatores poenitentiam agentes in gratiam recipiantur,
   et nemo excludatur. etsi peccata ejus rubeant ut sanguis; quandoquidem
   Dei misericordia major est, quam peccata totius mundi, et Deus omnium
   suorum operum miseretur.

   Sequitur Falsa et Erronea Doctrina Calvinistarum.

   De Sacra Coena.

   I. Quod supra posita verba Christi figurate intelligenda sint, et non
   secundum literam, sicut sonant.

   II. Quod in Coena tantum nuda signa sint, corpus autem Christi tam
   procul a pane, quam supremum coelum a terra.

   III. Quod Christus illic præsens sit tantum virtute et operatione sua,
   et non corpore suo. Quemadmodum sol splendore et operatione sua in
   terris præsens et efficax est, corpus autem solare superius in coelo
   existit.

   IV. Corpus Christi esse typicum corpus, quod pane et vino tantam
   significetur et præfiguretur.

   V. Quod sola fide, quæ in coelum se elevet, et non ore, accipiatur.

   VI. Quod soli digni illud accipiant, indigni autem, qui talem fidem
   evolantem sursum in coelos non habent, nihil præter panem et vinum
   accipiant.

   Falsa et Erronea Doctrina Calvinistarum.

   De Persona Christi,

   quæ potissimum iii. et iv. articulo purioris doctrinæ repugnat.

   I. Quod Deus Homo, et Homo Deus est, esse figuratam locutionem.

   II. Quod humana Natura cum divina non in re et veritate, sed tantum
   nomine et verbis communionem habeat.

   III. Quod Deo impossibile sit ex tota omnipotentia sua præstare, ut
   corpus Christi naturale simul et instantanee in pluribus, quam in unico
   loco sit.

   IV. Quod Christus secundum humanam Naturam per exaltationem suam tantnm
   creata dona et finitam potentiam acceperit, non omnia sciat aut possit.

   V. Quod Christus secundum Humanitatem absens regnet, sicut Rex Hispaniæ
   novas Insulas regit.

   VI. Quod damnabilis idololatria sit, si fiducia et fides cordis in
   Christum non solum secundum divinam, sed etiam secundum humanam ipsius
   Naturam collocetar, et honor adorationis ad utramque dirigatur.

   Falsa et Erronea Doctrina Calvinistarum.

   De Sacro Baptismo.

   I. Baptismum esse externum lavacrum aquæ, per quod interna quædam
   ablutio a peccatis tantum significetur.

   II. Baptisimum non operari neque conferre regenerationem, fidem,
   gratiam Dei et salutem, sed tantum significare et obsignare ista.

   III. Non omnes, qui aqua baptizantur, consequi eo ipso gratiam Christi
   aut donum fidei sed tantum electos.

   IV. Regenerationem non fieri in, vel cum Baptismo, sed postea demum
   crescente aetate, imo et multis in senectute demum contingere.

   V. Salutem non dependere a Baptismo, atque ideo Baptismum in causa
   necessitatis non permittendum esse in Ecclesia, sed in defectu
   ordinarii Ministri Ecclesiæ permittendum esse, ut infans sine Baptismo
   moriatur.

   VI. Christianorum infantes jam ante Baptismum esse sanctos, ab utero
   matris, imo adhuc in utero materno constitutes esse in foedere vitae
   æternæ cæteroqui Sacrum Baptisma ipsis conferri non posse.

   Falsa et Erronea Doctrina Calvinistarum.

   De Prædestinatione et Providentia Dei.

   I. Christum non pro omnibus hominibus, sed pro solis electis mortuum
   esse.

   II. Deum potissimam partem hominum ad damnationem æternam creasse, et
   nolle, ut potissima pars convertatur et vivat.

   III. Electos et regenitos non posse fidem et Spiritum Sanctum amittere,
   aut damnari, quamvis omnis generis grandia peccata et flagitia
   committant.

   IV. Eos vero, qui electi non sunt, necessario damnari, nec posse
   pervenire ad salutem, etiamsi millies baptizarentur, et quotidie ad
   Eucharistiam accederent, præterea vitam tam sancte atque inculpate
   ducerent, quantum unquam fieri potest.

   the Lord's vineyard of cunning foxes and wild hogs. His last wish was
   to die an enemy of Calvinists and Papists. Frank, l.c. Vol. I. p. 296.

   [704] See Frank, Vol. I. p. 297, and Henke's monograph on Casp. Peucer
   und Nic. Crell, 1865.

   [705] Baptism was performed with exorcism in Lutheran churches, and it
   was counted one of the chief crimes of the Crypto-Calvinists that they
   abolished this rite. A Saxon pastor who baptized without exorcism gave
   great offense to the peasants, who cried after him: 'The naughty priest
   has not expelled the devil' (Der lose Pfaffe hat den Teufel nicht
   ausgetrieben).

   [706] It is almost incredible to what extent the Lutheran bigotry of
   those days carried its hatred of Zwinglianism and Calvinism. We give a
   few characteristic specimens. Schlüsselburg (Superintendent of
   Ratzeburg), one of the most learned champions of Lutheran orthodoxy, in
   his Theologiæ Calvinistarum Libri Tres, Francoforti ad Mænum, 1592,
   tries to prove that the Calvinists are unsound in almost every article
   of the Christian faith ('Sacramentarios de nullo fere doctrinæ
   Christianæ articulo recte sentire'), and has a special chapter to show
   that the Calvinistic writings overflow with mendaciis, calumniis,
   conviciis, maledictis, et contumeliis. He regards many of their
   doctrines as downright blasphemy. Philip Nikolai, a pious Lutheran
   pastor at Unna, afterwards at Hamburg, and author of two of the finest
   German hymns ('Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern,' and 'Wachet auf!
   ruft uns die Stimme'), called the God of the Calvinists 'a roaring bull
   (Wucherstier und Brüllochs), a bloodthirsty Moloch, a hellish Behemoth
   and Leviathan, a fiend of men!' (Kurtzer Bericht von der Calvinisten
   Gott und ihrer Religion, Frkf. 1597; Die erst Victoria, Triumph und
   Freudenjubel über des Calvin Geistes Niederlag, 1600; Calvinischer
   Vitzliputzli, etc. See Frank, Vol. I. p. 280. Provost Magirus, of
   Stuttgart, thought that the Calvinists imitated at times the language
   of Luther, as the hyena the human voice, for the destruction of men.
   John Modest wrote a book to prove that the Sacramentarians are no
   Christians, but baptized Jews and Mohammedans ('Beweis aus der heiligen
   Schrift dass die Sacramentirer nicht Christen sind, sondern getaufte
   Juden und Mahometisten, Jena, 1586). John Prätorius, in a satire
   (Calvinisch Gasthaus zur Narrenkayffen, etc.), distinguishes open
   Calvinists, who have no more sense than a horse or an ass; secret
   Calvinists, who fish in the dark; and several other classes (see Frank,
   Vol. I. p. 282 sq.). The second Psalm, speaking of the rebellion
   against Jehovah and his Anointed, was applied to the Calvinists, and
   their condemnation was embodied in catechisms, hymns, and popular
   rhymes, of which the following are fair specimens:

   'Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort

    Und wehr der Calvinisten Mord.'

   'Wenn ein Calvinist spricht, Gott grüss dich,

    So wünscht sein Herz, der Tod hol dich.'

   'Gottes Wort und Luther's Lehr

    Vergehet nun und nimmermehr,

    Und ob's gleich bisse noch so sehr

    Die Calvinisten an ihrer Ehr.'

   'Gottes Wort und Lutheri Schrift

    Sind des Papsts und Calvini Gift.'

   § 49. AN ABORTIVE SYMBOL AGAINST SYNCRETISM, 1655.

   Finally, we must briefly notice an unsuccessful attempt to increase the
   number of Lutheran symbols which was made during the Syncretistic
   controversies in the middle of the seventeenth century. [707]

   George Calixtus (1586 to 1656), Professor of Theology in the University
   of Helmstädt (since 1614), which had previously protested against the
   ubiquity dogma of the Formula of Concord, was disgusted with the
   exclusive and pugnacious orthodoxy of his day, and advocated, in the
   liberal and catholic spirit of Melanchthon, peace and conciliation
   among the three great Confessions--the Lutheran, Catholic, and
   Reformed. He went back to the Apostles' Creed and the oecumenical
   consensus of the first five centuries (consensus quinquesecularis) as a
   common basis for all, claiming for the Lutheran Church only a superior
   purity of doctrine, and surrendering as unessential its distinctive
   peculiarities. This reaction against sectarian exclusiveness and in
   favor of Catholic expansion within the Lutheran communion was denounced
   by the orthodox divines of Wittenberg and Leipzig as Syncretism, i.e.,
   as a Babylonian mixture of all sorts of religions, or a Samaritan
   compound of Popish, Calvinistic, Synergistic, Arminian, and even
   atheistic errors. A war to the knife was waged against it, and lasted
   from 1645 to 1686. Calixtus had expressed a hope to meet many
   Calvinists in heaven, but this was traced directly to an inspiration of
   the devil.

   The chief opponent of Syncretism was Abraham Calovius, the fearless
   champion of an infallible orthodoxy, admired by some as the Lutheran
   Athanasius, abhorred by others as the Lutheran Torquemada; in his own
   estimation a strenuus Christi athleta, certainly a veritable malleus
   hæreticorum; of vast learning and a herculean working power, which no
   amount of domestic affliction could break down. [708] His daily prayer
   was, 'Reple me, Deus, odio hoereticorum.' He excluded Calixtus, as well
   as Bellarmin, Calvin, and Socinus, from heaven. As the best means of
   suppressing this complex syncretistic heresy, and of preventing a
   schism in the Lutheran Church, he prepared in 1655 a Repeated Consensus
   of the truly Lutheran Faith, which was finally published in Latin and
   German at Wittenberg in 1664. [709]

   This creed first professes and teaches, in the order of the Augsburg
   Confession, the orthodox doctrine, and then rejects and condemns no
   less than eighty-eight syncretistic heresies, proved from the writings
   of Calixtus, Hornejus, Latermann, and Dreier. The first fundamental
   section anathematizes the Calixtine concession of the imperfection of
   the Lutheran Church, the relative recognition of Catholics and
   Calvinists as Christian brethren, and the assertion of the necessity of
   Church tradition alongside of the Scriptures. The following doctrines
   are rejected, not simply as doubtful, erroneous, or dangerous opinions
   (which some of them are), but as downright heresies: That the article
   of the Trinity is not clearly revealed in the Old Testament; that the
   Holy Spirit dwells in believers as a gift, not as an essence; that
   theology need not prove the existence of God, since it is already
   certain from philosophy; that Jews and Mohammedans are not idolaters;
   that original sin is simply a carentia justitiæ; that souls are created
   by God (creationism); that Christ's body is not omnipresent; that
   sanctification enters in any way into the idea of justification; that
   the true Church embraces also Calvinists, Papists, and Greeks; that
   infants have no faith; that John vi. treats of the Lord's Supper; that
   man is active in his conversion; that symbolical books are to be only
   conditionally subscribed quatenus Scripturæ S. consentiunt; that the
   symbols contain many things as necessary to salvation, which God has
   not fixed as such; that unbaptized infants are only negatively
   punished; that good works are necessary to obtain eternal life. A
   prayer that God may avert all innovations and corruptions from the
   Orthodox Church, and preserve it in this repeated consensus, forms the
   conclusion.

   This new symbol goes far beyond the Formula of Concord, and would have
   so contracted Lutheranism as to exclude from it all independent thought
   and theological progress. It prolonged and intensified the controversy,
   but nowhere attained ecclesiastical authority. It was subscribed only
   by the theological faculties of Wittenberg and Leipzig, and rejected by
   the theologians of Jena, who were pupils of the celebrated John
   Gerhard, and occupied a milder position. With the death of Calovius the
   controversy died out, and his symbol was buried beyond the hope of a
   resurrection. Orthodoxy triumphed, but it was only a partial victory,
   and the last which it achieved.

   During these violent controversies and the awful devastations of the
   Thirty-Years' War, there arose among a few divines in the Lutheran,
   Reformed, and Catholic Churches an intense desire for the reunion of
   Christendom, which found its expression in the famous adage so often
   erroneously attributed to St. Augustine: 'In necessariis unitas, in
   dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas. [710] It had no practical effect,
   but sounds like a prophecy of better times.

   Soon afterwards arose a second and more successful reaction in the
   Pietism of Spener and Francke, which insisted on the claims of
   practical piety against a dead orthodoxy in the Lutheran Church, just
   as the school of Coccejus did in the Reformed Church of Holland, and
   the Methodism of Wesley and Whitefield in the Church of England. Then
   followed, toward the close of the eighteenth century, the far more
   radical reaction of Rationalism, which broke down, stone by stone, the
   venerable building of Lutheran orthodoxy, and the whole traditional
   system of Christian doctrine. Rationalism, in its various forms and
   phases, laid waste whole sections of Germany, especially those where
   once a rigorous orthodoxy had most prevailed; it affected also the
   Reformed churches of the Continent, and, in a less degree, those of
   England and America. Fortunately the power of this great modern
   apostasy has been broken, in the nineteenth century, by an extensive
   revival of the principles of the Reformation, with a better
   appreciation of its Confessions of Faith, not so much in their
   subordinate differences as in their essential harmony.

   [708] Abraham Calov (properly Kalau) was born in 1612 at Mohrungen,
   Prussia (the birthplace of the great Herder--'Esau and Jacob from one
   womb'), and labored with untiring industry as Professor and General
   Superintendent at Wittenberg from 1650 to his death, 1686. He stood in
   high esteem, and controlled the whole faculty, except Meisner, who fell
   out with him in 1675, so that they no more greeted each other, not even
   at the communion altar. The Elector, George II., always stayed at his
   house when he was at Wittenberg. Calovius wrote a system of theology,
   in twelve volumes (Sytstema locorum theolog. 1655-1677), a Commentary
   on the whole Bible against Grotius, in four folios (Biblia illustrata,
   1672), and an endless number of polemical works against ancient and
   modern heretics, some of which had to be prohibited. His domestic
   history is perhaps without a parallel. He buried no less than thirteen
   children and five wives in succession. At the death-bed of the fourth
   he sang with all his might the hymn, 'Wie schön leuchtet der
   Morgenstern,' especially (as Tholuck relates) the last stanza, 'Wie bin
   ich doch so herzlich froh.' etc. He asked her whether she were willing
   to go to her Lord; she replied: 'Herr Jesu, dir leb' ich, Herr Jesu,
   dir sterb' ich.' A few months after the death of his fifth partner,
   when seventy-two years of age ('senili amore, morbo nequaquam senili,
   vehementer laborans,' and 'maxima cum multorum offensione'), he led to
   the altar the youthful daughter of his colleague, Quenstädt. A friend
   of Spener wrote to the latter, May 10, 1684 (as quoted by Tholuck):
   'The septuagenarian senex consularis has prostituted himself strongly
   intra and extra ecclesiam. What is the use of all learning, if one can
   not control his appetites? He is said to be so debilitated that he can
   not walk five steps sine lassitudine.' Calovius enjoyed his sixth
   marriage only two years. For a full account of him, see Tholuck,
   Wittenberger Theologen, 1852, pp. 185-211, and his Art. Calov, in
   Herzog, Vol. II. p. 506; also Gass, Geschichte der protest. Dogm. Vol.
   I. p. 332; and G. Frank, Vol. II. p. 26. Tholuck characterizes him thus
   (W. Theol. p. 207): ' Gemüthlose Zähigkeit bei innerlich kochender
   Leidenschaftlichkeit erscheint als Grundzug dieses theologischen
   Charakters; weder auf der Kanzel, noch in vertraulichen Briefen, noch
   in den theologischen Schriften ein Lebenshauch christlicher, selten
   auch nur menschlicher Wärme. Die Menschen erscheinen ihm wie Zahlen,
   und unter den dogmatischen Problemen bewegt er sich wie unter
   Rechenexempeln.'

   [709] 'Consensus repetitus fidei vere Lutheranæ in illis doctrinæ
   capitibus, quæ contra puram et invariatam Augustanam Confessionem
   aliosgue libros symbolicos in Libro Concordiæ comprehensos, scriptis
   publicis impugnant D. G. Calixtus, ejusque complices.' First published
   in the Consilia Theologica Wittebergensia, 1664, then often separately
   by Calovius. A new edition by the late Prof. Henke of Marburg:
   Consensus repetitus fidei veræ Lutheranæ, MDCLV. Librorum ecclesiæ
   evangelicæ symbolicorum supplementum, Marburg, 1847 (pp. viii. and 70).
   For a summary, see H. Schmid, l.c. pp. 376 sqq., and Frank, l.c. Vol.
   II. pp. 12 sqq. Calovius wrote no less than twenty-eight books against
   the Syncretists, the principal of which are Syncretismus Calixtinus,
   1653; Synopsis controversiarum . . . cum hæreticis et schismaticis
   modernis Socinianis, Anabaptistis, Weigelianis, Remonstrantibus,
   Pontificiis, Calvinianis, Calixtinis, etc. 1652; and Harmonia
   Calixtino-hæretica, etc., 1655. See H. Schmid, l.c. p. 237, who with
   all his orthodox sympathies complains of the endless repetitions and
   prolixity of these controversial writings. They are almost unreadable.
   I have before me a defense of the Consensus Repetitus, by Aegidius
   Straucher. Wittenb. 1668 (551 pp.), the mere title of which covers
   twenty-nine lines.

   [710] Dr. Lücke (in a special treatise, Göttingen, 1850) traces the
   authorship with some degree of certainty to Rupert Meldenius, who
   belonged to the irenical school of the seventeenth century. Comp.
   Klose, in Herzog, Vol. IX. p. 304.

   § 50. The Reformed Confessions.

   Literature.

   I. Collections of Reformed Symbols.

   Harmonia | Confession | Fidei | Orthodixarum, et Reformatarum
   Ecclesiarum, | quæ in præcipuis quibusque Europæ Regnis, Nationibus, et
   Provinciis, sacrum Evangelii doctrinam pure profitentur: quarum
   catalogum et ordinem sequentes paginæ indicabunt. | Additæ sunt ad
   calcem brevissimæ observationes: quibus turn illustrantur obscura, tum
   quæ in speciem pugnare inter se videri possunt, perspicue atque
   modestissime conciliantur: et si quæ adhuc contraversa manent, syncere
   indiciantur. | Quæ omnia, Ecclesiarum Gallicarum, et Belgicarum nomine,
   subjiciuntur libero et prudenti reliquarum omnium judicio. Genevæ apud
   Petrum Santandreanum. MDLXXXI. (4to).

   This is the first attempt at comparative Dogmatics or Symbolics. It
   grew out of a desire for one common Creed, which was modified into the
   idea of a selected harmony. In this shape it was proposed by the
   Protestants of Zurich and Geneva, intrusted to Beza, Daneau, and Salnar
   (or Salnard, or Salvart, minister of the Church of Castres), and
   chiefly executed by the last of the three. It was intended as a defense
   of Protestant, and particularly Reformed, doctrine against the constant
   attacks of Romanists and Lutherans. It does not give the Confessions in
   full, but extracts from them on the chief articles of faith, which are
   classified under nineteen sections. It anticipates Winer's method, but
   for harmonistic purposes. Besides the principal Reformed Confessions,
   three Lutheran Confessions are also used, viz., the Augsburg, the
   Saxon, and the Würtemberg Confessions. The work appeared almost
   simultaneously with the Lutheran Formula of Concord, and may be called
   a Reformed Formula of Concord, though differing from the former in
   being a mere compilation from previous symbols. (I imported a
   well-bound copy, which seems to have been the property of the Elector
   John Casimir, whose likeness and escutcheon are impressed on the cover.
   He suggested the preparation of such a work.)

   An English translation of this irenic work appeared first at Cambridge,
   1586 (12mo), and then again in London, 1643 (4to), under the title: 'An
   Harmony of the Confessions of Faith of the Christian and Reformed
   Churches, which purely profess the holy doctrine of the Gospel, in all
   the chief kingdoms, nations, and provinces of Europe, etc. All which
   things, in the names of the Churches of France and Belgia, are
   submitted to the free and discreet judgment of all the Churches. Newly
   translated out of Latin into English, etc. Allowed by public
   authority.' According to Strype (Annals of the Reformation, ad a.
   1586), Archbishop Whitgift, owing to some jealousy among publishers,
   first forbade the publication of the Harmony, but afterwards allowed
   it.

   A new edition by Rev. Peter Hall (Rector of Milston, Wilts), under the
   modified title: The Harmony of Protestant Confessions: exhibiting the
   Faith of the Churches of Christ, Reformed after the pure and holy
   doctrine of the Gospel, throughout Europe. Translated from the Latin. A
   new edition, revised and considerably enlarged. London, 1842 (640
   pages, large 8vo).

   Corpus et Syntagma | Confessionum | Fidei, | quæ in diversis regnis et
   nationibus, ecclesiarum nomine fuerunt authentice editæ: in
   celeberrimis conventibus exhibitæ, publicaque auctoritate comprobatæ,
   etc. (first ed. Aureliæ Allobrog. 1612). Editio nova, Genevæ, sumptibus
   Petri Chouët, 1654.

   The first edition of this rare and valuable book was probably compiled
   by Gaspar Laurentius, who is not named on the title-page, but who signs
   himself in the dedicatory Epistle to Elector Frederick III. of the
   Palatinate, before the 'Orthodox Consensus' (in Part III.), and says,
   in the 'General Preface,' that he edited this Consensus a. 1595, and
   now (1612) in a much improved form. His object was the same as that of
   the Harmony, viz., to show the essential unity of the evangelical faith
   in the multiplicity and variety of Confessions which, as the Preface
   says, in the absence of conspiracy, only strengthen the harmony, and
   mutually illustrate and supplement each other, like many orthodox
   expositions of the Scriptures. The second edition, of which I have a
   copy, is a large quarto volume, consisting of three main parts, the
   several documents being paged separately. It contains the principal
   Reformed Confessions down to the Synod of Dort, three Lutheran
   Confessions, and several other documents, as follows: 1. The Harmonia
   sive Concordantia Confessionum Fidei per (xiii.) Articulos digesta,
   with the Symbolum Apostolicum, as the basis of a general consensus,
   supported by Scripture texts and references to the various Confessions
   of the collection (8 pp.); 2. Confessio Helvetica posterior, reprinted
   from a Zurich edition of 1651: 3. Confessio Helvetica prior (or
   Basileensis II.), 1536; 4. Confessio Basileensis I. (or Mylhusiana),
   1532; 5. Confessio Gallica, from the Latin edition of 1566; 6.
   Confessio Anglicana, 1562; 7. Confessio Scotica of 1560, and the second
   of 1580; 8. Confessio Ecclesiarum Belgicarum, 1559; 9. Confessio
   Czengerina, the Hungarian Confession, 1570; 10. Confessio Polonica, or
   Consensus Poloniæ (Sendomirensis) 1570; 11. Confessio Argentinensis S.
   Tetrapolitana, 1531; 12. Confessio Angustana, from the Wittenberg
   edition of 1540; 13. Confessio Saxonica, s. Misnica, 1551; 14.
   Confessio Wirtembergica, 1552; 15. Confessio Illustrissimi Electoris
   Palatini, Friderici III., 1576; 16. Confessio Bohemica (the first of
   the two Bohemian Confessions, which was presented to King Ferdinand in
   1535. It contains a Preface by Luther. The second was compiled 1575);
   17. Consensus Ecclesiarum Majoris el Minoris Poloniæ, Lithuaniæ, etc.,
   1583. Appended: Acta et Conclusiones Synodi Generalis Thoruniensis; 18.
   Articuli Confessionis Basileensis of the year 1647; 19. Canones Synodi
   Dordrechtanæ, 1619; 20. Confessio Cyrilli Patriarchæ Constantinop.,
   1631; 21. Catholicus Consensus, viz., A Harmony of Christian Doctrine,
   compiled from the Scriptures and the writings of the Fathers, under the
   following heads: (a) On the Word of God as the Rule of Faith; (b) On
   God, the Trinitarian and Christological Doctrines; (c) On Divine
   Providence; (d) On the Head of the Church; (e) On Justification; (f) On
   Free Will, Original Sin, Election and Predestination; (g) On the
   Sacraments; (h) On Idolatry, the Worship of Images, etc.; (i) On the
   True Way of Worshiping and Serving God; (k) On the Church and the
   Ministry; (l) Resurrection and the Future State.

   1804. Ed. altera et auctior (under the revision of Bishop Lloyd). Oxon.
   1827. No editor mentioned. This Collection (suggested by Bishop
   Cleaver) is very elegantly printed in the Clarendon Press, but has no
   critical value, and is incomplete. It contains: The Profession of the
   Tridentine Faith, the Second Helvetic Confession, the Basle Confession
   (1532), the Altered Augsburg Confession of 1540 (to which, in the
   second edition only, was added the Augustana of 1530), the Saxon
   Confession, the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the
   Canons of the Synod of Dort, all in Latin, and without a translation or
   introduction.

   Belgic, the Hungarian, Polish, and Bohemian Confessions, the Canons of
   Dort, the Consensus Helveticus, and the Geneva and Heidelberg
   Catechisms, with an historical and literary dissertation.

   is the most complete Latin collection of Reformed Symbols, and contains
   thirty-one in all, including the Zwinglian and early Swiss Confessions.
   It is, however, poorly edited, without an index and table of contents.
   Niemeyer had completed the large volume before he had seen a single
   copy of the Westminster Standards, and he published them nine months
   afterwards in an Appendix.

   The Reformed Confessions are much more numerous than the Lutheran,
   because they represent a larger territory and several
   nationalities--Swiss, German, French, Dutch, English, and Scotch--each
   of which produced its own doctrinal and disciplinary standards, since
   the geographical and political divisions and the close relations to the
   civil government determined also the number of ecclesiastical
   organizations. The productive period of the Reformed movement,
   moreover, extended far into the seventeenth century, especially in
   England, and some of the most important confessions, as the Canons of
   Dort and the Westminster Standards, were made long after the symbolic
   development of the Lutheran Church had reached its culmination and rest
   in the Formula of Concord. Finally the Reformed Church departs further
   from the authority of ecclesiastical traditionalism than the Lutheran,
   and allows more freedom for the development of various types of
   doctrine and schools of theology within the limits of the Word of God,
   to which it more rigidly adheres.

   But with all this variety, the Reformed symbols are as much agreed in
   the essential articles of faith as the Lutheran, and differ even less
   than the Augsburg Confession, as explained by its author and his
   school, differs from the Formula of Concord. [711] They exhibit
   substantially the same system of doctrine, and are only variations of
   one theme according to the wants of the national Churches for which
   they were intended. The Reformed Churches were never organically united
   under one form of government, and even every little canton in
   Switzerland (as every Lutheran principality in Germany) has its own
   ecclesiastical establishment; [712] but they recognized each other as
   branches of the same family, and kept up a lively intercommunion. Even
   the leading divines and dignitaries of the Episcopal Church of England,
   during the sixteenth century, freely corresponded with the Reformed
   Churches of Switzerland, France, and Holland, and the difference in
   church polity was no bar to church fellowship.

   There are in all over thirty Reformed creeds. But many of them had
   never more than local authority, or were superseded by later and
   maturer forms. None of them has the same commanding position as the
   Augsburg Confession in the Lutheran Church. Those which have been most
   widely accepted and are still most in use are the Heidelberg or
   Palatinate Catechism, the Thirty-nine Articles, and the Westminster
   Confession. The second Helvetic Confession and the Canons of Dort are
   equal to them in authority and theological importance, but less adapted
   for popular use. All the rest have now little more than historical
   significance.

   As to origin and theological character, the Reformed Confessions may be
   divided into Zwinglian and Calvinistic. The earlier were the product of
   Zwingli and his Swiss coadjutors, the later date from Calvin or his
   pupils and successors, and exhibit a more advanced and matured state of
   doctrine, with a difference, however, as to the extent to which they
   are committed to the Calvinistic system; some accepting it in full,
   while others maintain a reserve in regard to its angular points and
   rigorous logical consequences.

   As to the country in which they originated and for which they were
   chiefly intended, we may divide them into Swiss, German, French, Dutch,
   English, and Scotch Confessions.

   To the Swiss family belong the Confessions which proceeded from the
   Churches of Zurich, Basle, Berne, and Geneva, partly of Zwinglian and
   partly of Calvinistic origin.

   The German family embraces the Tetrapolitan Confession, the Heidelberg
   Catechism, the Brandenburg and Anhalt Confessions, and a few others.
   They are less pronounced in their Calvinism, and mediate between it and
   the Lutheran Creed.

   To France and the Netherlands belong the French and the Belgic
   Confessions, the Canons of the Synod of Dort, and also the Arminian
   Articles, which differ from the Calvinistic creeds in five points.

   The English family embraces the Thirty-nine Articles, the old Scotch
   Confessions, and the later Westminster Standards.

   Besides, there are Bohemian, Polish, and Hungarian Confessions of
   lesser importance.


   Note.--We take the term Reformed here in its catholic and historical
   sense for all those Churches which were founded by Zwingli and Calvin
   and their fellow-reformers in the sixteenth century on the Continent,
   and in England and Scotland, and which agreed with the Lutheran Church
   in opposition to the Roman Catholic, but differed from it in the
   doctrine of the real presence, afterward also in the doctrine of
   predestination. By their opponents they were first called in derision
   Zwinglians and Calvinists, also Sacramentarians or Sacramentschwärmer
   (by Luther and in the Formula of Concord), and in France Huguenots. But
   they justly repudiated all such sectarian names, and used instead the
   designations Christian or Evangelical or Reformed, or Evangelical
   Reformed or Reformed Catholic. The term Reformed assumed the ascendency
   in Switzerland, France, and elsewhere. Beza, e.g., uses it constantly.
   Queen Elizabeth, in sundry letters to the Protestant courts of Germany
   in 1577, speaks throughout of ecclesiæ reformatæ, and once calls the
   non-Lutheran Churches ecclesiæ reformatiores, more Reformed, implying
   that the Lutheran is Reformed also.

   The Lutherans, before the last quarter of the sixteenth century, called
   themselves likewise Christian and Evangelical, sometimes Reformed, and
   since 1530 the Church or Churches of the Augsburg Confession, or
   Verwandte der Augsburgischen Confession. For a long time they disowned
   the terms Lutheranus, Luthericus, Lutheranismus, which were first used
   by Dr. Eck, Cochlæus, Erasmus, and other Romanists with the view to
   stigmatize their religion as a recent innovation and human invention.
   (A Papist once asked a Lutheran, 'Where was your Church before Luther?'
   The Lutheran answered by asking another question, 'Where was your face
   this morning before it was washed?') Erasmus speaks of Lutherana
   tragædia, negotium Lutheranum, factio Lutherana. Hence the Lutheran
   symbols never use the term Lutheran, except once, and then by way of
   complaint that the 'dear, holy Gospel should be called Lutheran.' [713]
   Luther himself complained of this use of his name; nevertheless he had
   no objection that it should be duly honored in connection with the Word
   of God, and thought that his followers need not be ashamed of him.
   [714] They thought so, too; and, forgetting St. Paul's warning against
   sectarian names, they gradually themselves appropriated the term
   Lutheran, or Evangelical Lutheran, as the official title of their
   Church, since about 1585, under the influence of Jacob Andreæ, the
   chief author of the Formula of Concord, and Ægidius Hunnius, and in
   connection with the faith in Luther as a special messenger of God for
   the restoration of Christianity in its doctrinal purity. See the proof
   in the little book of Dr. Heinrich Heppe, Ursprung und Geschichte der
   Bezeichnungen 'reformirte' und 'lutherische' Kirche, Gotha, 1859, pp.
   28, 35, 55.

   The negative term Protestant was used after 1529 for both Confessions
   by friend and foe, and is so used to this day; but it must be explained
   from the historical occasion which gave rise to it, and be connected
   with the positive faith in the Word of God, on the ground of which the
   evangelical members of the Diet of Spires protested against the
   decision of the papal majority, as an encroachment on the rights of
   conscience and an enforcement of the traditions of men.

   On the Continent of Europe it is still customary to divide orthodox
   Christendom into three Confessions or Creeds--the Catholic (Greek and
   Roman), the Lutheran, and the Reformed--and to embrace under the
   Reformed all other Protestant bodies, such as Methodists and Baptists,
   or to speak of them as mere sects. But this will not do in England and
   America, where these sects, so called, have become powerful Churches.
   Reformed is sometimes used among us in a more general sense of all
   Protestant Churches, sometimes in a restricted sense of a particular
   branch of the Reformed Church. The Continental terminology suits the
   ecclesiastical statistics of the sixteenth century, but must be
   considerably enlarged and modified in view of the greater number of
   Anglo-American Churches. We shall devote a separate chapter to those
   Protestant evangelical bodies which have taken their rise since the
   Reformation.

   [711] This doctrinal consensus of the Reformed Creeds has been shown as
   early as 1581 in the Harmonia Confessionum above quoted.

   [712] In this respect the Churches of the United States, being free
   from government control, are much better organized, according to
   creeds, without allowing the State boundaries to interfere with their
   organic unity.

   [713] Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Art. XV. (VIII. p. 213 ed.
   Müller): 'Das liebe, heilige Evangelium nennen sie [the Papists]
   Lutherisch.' The name of Luther, however, is often honorably mentioned,
   especially in the Formula of Concord.

   [714] 'Wahr ist's,' he says (Works, Erl. ed. Vol. XXVIII. p. 316),
   'dass du bei Leib und Seele nicht sol1st sagen: ich bin Lutherisch oder
   Päpstisch; denn derselben ist keiner für dich gestorben, noch dein
   Meister, sondern allein Christus, und sollst dich (als) Christen
   bekennen. Aber wenn du es dafür hältst, dass des Luthers Lehre
   evangelisch und des Papstes unevangelisch sei, so musst du den Luther
   nicht so gar hinwerfen. Du wirfst sonst seine Lehre auch mit hin, die
   du doch für Christi Lehre erkennest; sondern also musst du sagen: der
   Luther sei ein Bube oder heilig, da liegt mir nichts an; seine Lehre
   aber ist nicht sein, sondern Christi selbst.' And in another place
   (Vol. XL. p. 127): 'Und wiewohl ich's nicht gern habe, dass man die
   Lehre und Leute Lutherisch nennt, und muss von ihnen leiden, dass sie
   Gottes Wort mit meinem Namen also schänden, so sollen sie doch den
   Luther, die Lutherischen Lehre und Leute lassen bleiben und zu Ehren
   kommen.'

   Zwingli (1484-1531) represents the first stage of the Reformed Church
   in Switzerland. He began what Calvin and others completed. He died in
   the prime of life, a patriot and martyr, on the battle-field, when his
   work seemed to be but half done. His importance is historical rather
   than doctrinal. He was the most clear-headed and liberal among the
   reformers, but lacked the genius, depth, and vigor of Luther and
   Calvin. He held opinions on the sacraments, original sin (as a disorder
   rather than a state of guilt), and on the salvation of all infants
   (unbaptized as well as baptized) and the nobler heathen, which then
   appeared radical, dangerous, and profane. He could conceive of a broad
   and free Christian union, consistent with doctrinal differences and
   denominational distinctions. He was a patriotic republican, frank,
   honorable, incorruptible, cheerful, courteous, and affable. He took an
   active part in all the public affairs of Switzerland, and labored to
   free it from foreign influence, misgovernment and immorality. He began
   at Einsiedeln (1516), and more effectively at Zurich (since 1519), to
   preach Christ from the pure fountain of the New Testament, and to set
   him forth as the only Mediator and all-sufficient Saviour. Then
   followed his attacks upon the corruptions of Rome, and the Reformation
   was introduced step by step in Zurich, where he exercised a controlling
   influence, and in the greater part of German Switzerland, until its
   progress was suddenly checked by the catastrophe at Cappel, 1531.

   Zwingli was scarcely two months younger than Luther, who survived him
   fifteen years. Both were educated and ordained in the Roman Church, and
   became innocently and providentially reformers of that Church. Both
   were men of strong mind, heroic character, fervent piety, and
   commanding influence over the people. Both were good scholars, great
   divines, and fond of poetry and music. [715] Both labored independently
   for the same great cause of evangelical Protestantism--the one on a
   smaller, the other on a larger field. But their endowment, training,
   and conversion were different. Zwingli had less prejudice, more
   practical common-sense, clear discrimination, sober judgment,
   self-control, courtesy, and polish--Luther more productive genius,
   poetic imagination, overpowering eloquence, mystic; depth, fire, and
   passion; and was in every way a richer and stronger, though rougher and
   wilder nature. Zwingli's eyes were opened by the reading of the Greek
   Testament, which he carefully copied with his own hand, and the
   humanistic learning of his friend Erasmus; while Luther passed through
   the ascetic struggles of monastic life, till he found peace of
   conscience in the doctrine of justification by faith alone. Zwingli
   broke more rapidly and more radically with the Roman Church than
   Luther. He boldly abolished all doctrines and usages not taught in the
   Scriptures; Luther piously retained what was not clearly forbidden. He
   aimed at a reformation of government and discipline as well as
   theology; Luther confined himself to such changes as were directly
   connected with doctrine. He was a Swiss and a republican; Luther, a
   German and a monarchist. He was a statesman as well as a theologian;
   Luther kept aloof from all political complications, and preached the
   doctrine of passive obedience to established authority. They met but
   once in this world, and then as antagonists, at Marburg, two years
   before Zwingli's death. They could not but respect each other
   personally, though Luther approached the Swiss with the strongest
   prejudice, looking upon him as a fanatic and semi-infidel. [716] They
   came to an agreement on every article of faith except the real presence
   in the eucharist. Zwingli proposed, with tears, peace and union,
   notwithstanding this difference, but Luther refused the hand of
   Christian fellowship, because he made doctrinal agreement the
   boundary-line of brotherhood. [717]

   Zwingli wrote four dogmatic works of a semi-symbolic character, which
   are closely interwoven with the history of the Reformation in German
   Switzerland, and present a clear exhibition of the Reformed faith in
   the first stage of its development. These are the Sixty-seven Articles
   of Zurich (A.D. 1523), the Ten Theses of Berne (1528), the Confession
   of Faith to the German Emperor Charles V. (1530), and the Exposition of
   the Christian Faith to King Francis I. of France (1531). [718]

   1. The Sixty-seven Articles, or Conclusions. [719]

   They were prepared for a public disputation held January 29, 1523, in
   the city of Zurich, where Zwingli was chief pastor from 1519, and were
   victoriously defended by him, in the presence of the civil magistrate
   and about six hundred persons, against Dr. Faber, the General Vicar of
   the Bishop of Constance, who appeared to superintend the meeting rather
   than to defend the old doctrines, and was unwilling or unable to answer
   the arguments of a learned and powerful opponent. The magistrate passed
   a resolution on the same day approving of Zwingli's position, and
   requiring all the ministers of the canton to preach nothing but what
   they could prove from the holy gospel. A second disputation followed in
   October, on the use of images and the mass, before about nine hundred
   persons, including three hundred priests and delegates from different
   cantons; a third disputation took place in January, 1524. The result
   was the emancipation from popery, and the orderly and permanent
   establishment of the Reformed Church in the city and canton of Zurich.

   These Articles resemble the Ninety-five Theses of Luther, which opened
   the drama of the Reformation in Germany, October 31, 1517, but they
   mark a considerable advance in Protestant conviction. They are full of
   Christ, as the only Saviour and Mediator, and clearly recognize the
   Word of God as the only rule of faith. They attack the primacy of the
   Pope, the mass, the invocation of saints, the meritoriousness of human
   works, fasts, pilgrimages, celibacy, and purgatory, as unscriptural
   traditions of men. They are short, and, in this respect, like the
   Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, better adapted for a
   creed than the lengthy confessions of that age. But they never had more
   than local authority. We give a few specimens:


   1. All who say that the gospel is nothing without the approbation of
   the Church, err and cast reproach upon God.

   2. The sum of the gospel is that our Lord Jesus Christ, the true Son of
   God, has made known to us the will of his heavenly Father, and redeemed
   us by his innocence from eternal death, and reconciled us to God.

   3. Therefore Christ is the only way to salvation for all who were, who
   are, and who shall be.

   4. Whosoever seeks or shows another door, errs--yea, is a murderer of
   souls and a robber.

   7. Christ is the Head of all believers.

   8. All who live in this Head are his members and children of God. And
   this is the true Catholic Church, the communion of saints.

   15. Who believes the gospel shall be saved; who believeth not shall be
   damned. For in the gospel the whole truth is clearly contained.

   16. From the gospel we learn that the doctrines and traditions of men
   are of no use to salvation.

   17. Christ is the one eternal high-priest.

   18. Christ, who offered himself once on the cross, is the sufficient
   and perpetual sacrifice for the sins of all believers. Therefore the
   mass is no sacrifice, but a commemoration of the one sacrifice of the
   cross and a seal of the redemption through Christ.

   19. Christ is the only Mediator between God and us.

   22. Christ is our righteousness. From this it follows that our works
   are good so far as they are Christ's, but not good so far as they are
   our own.

   24. Christians are not bound to any works which Christ has not
   commanded.

   26. Nothing is more displeasing to God than hypocrisy.

   27. All Christians are brethren.

   34. The power of the Pope and the Bishops has no foundation in the Holy
   Scriptures and the doctrine of Christ.

   49. I know of no greater scandal than the prohibition of lawful
   marriage to priests, while they are permitted for money to have
   concubines. Shame! (Pfui der Schande!)

   50. God alone forgives sins, through Jesus Christ our Lord alone.

   57. The Holy Scripture knows nothing of a purgatory after this life.

   2. The Ten Theses of Berne.

   After the Conference between the Reformed and the Roman divines (headed
   by Dr. Eck), held at Baden, in Aargau, May, 1526, which formed a
   turning-point in the history of the Swiss Reformation (more decided
   than the similar disputation between Luther and Eck in Leipzig, 1519),
   the Reformation triumphed in Berne, the most conservative and
   aristocratic as well as most influential canton of the confederacy.
   Three ministers, Berthold Haller, Francis Kolb, and Sebastian Meyer,
   friends of Zwingli, and a gifted layman, Nicolas Manuel, who was a
   statesman, poet, and painter, had previously prepared the way under
   great opposition. The magistrate convened a convocation of the clergy
   and laity, which continued nineteen days, from January 6 to 26, 1528,
   discussing ten theses which Zwingli had revised and published at the
   request of Haller. Delegates appeared from other cantons (except the
   Roman Catholic), and the South German cities of Constance, Ulm, Lindau,
   and Strasburg. The Bishops of Constance, Basle, Lausanne, and Sion were
   also invited, but declined to attend, except the Bishop of Lausanne,
   who sent a few doctors. Dr. Eck, who had figured as the champion of
   Romanism in Baden (as well as previously at Leipzig), prudently
   disdained at this time to follow 'the heretics into their corners and
   dens.' The principal champions of the Reformed cause were Zwingli (who
   also preached two very effective sermons on the Apostles' Creed, and
   against the mass), OEcolampadius, Haller, Kolb, Pellican, Megander,
   Bucer, and Capito. They carried a complete victory, and hereafter
   Berne, Zurich, and Basle--the three most enlightened and influential
   German cantons--were closely linked together in the Reformed faith.
   [720]

   The Bernese Theses are as follows:

   1. The holy Christian Church, whose only Head is Christ, is born of the
   Word of God, and abides in the same, and listens not to the voice of a
   stranger.

   2. The Church of Christ makes no laws and commandments without the Word
   of God. Hence human traditions are no more binding on us than they are
   founded in the Word of God.

   3. Christ is the only wisdom, righteousness, redemption, and
   satisfaction for the sins of the whole world. Hence it is a denial of
   Christ when we confess another ground of salvation and satisfaction.

   4. The essential and corporeal presence of the body and blood of Christ
   can not be demonstrated from the Holy Scripture.

   5. The mass as now in use, in which Christ is offered to God the Father
   for the sins of the living and the dead, is contrary to the Scripture,
   a blasphemy against the most holy sacrifice, passion, and death of
   Christ, and on account of its abuses an abomination before God.

   6. As Christ alone died for us, so he is also to be adored as the only
   Mediator and Advocate between God the Father and the believers.
   Therefore it is contrary to the Word of God to propose and invoke other
   mediators.

   7. Scripture knows nothing of a purgatory after this life. Hence all
   masses and other offices for the dead are useless.

   8. The worship of images is contrary to the Scripture. Therefore images
   should be abolished when they are set up as objects of adoration.

   9. Matrimony is not forbidden in the Scripture to any class of men, but
   permitted to all.

   10. Since, according to the Scripture, an open fornicator must be
   excommunicated, it follows that unchastity and impure celibacy are more
   pernicious to the clergy than to any other class. [721]

   In his farewell sermon, Zwingli thus addressed the Bernese: 'Victory
   has declared for the truth, but perseverance alone can complete the
   triumph. Christ persevered unto death. Ferendo vincitur fortuna. Behold
   these idols, behold them conquered, mute, and scattered before us. The
   gold you have spent upon these foolish images must henceforth be
   devoted to the comfort of the living images of God in their poverty. In
   conclusion, stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us
   free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage (Gal. v. 1).
   Fear not! the God who has enlightened you, will enlighten also your
   confederates; and Switzerland, regenerated by the Holy Ghost, shall
   flourish in righteousness and peace.'

   3. The Confession of Faith to Emperor Charles V. [722]

   Zwingli took advantage of the meeting of the famous Diet at Augsburg,
   held A.D. 1530, to send a Confession of his faith addressed to the
   German Emperor Charles V., shortly after the Lutheran Princes had
   presented theirs (June 25). It is dated Zurich, July 3, and was
   delivered by his messenger at Augsburg on the 8th of the same month,
   but it shared the same fate as the 'Tetrapolitan Confession' of Bucer
   and Capito: it was never laid before the Diet, and was treated with
   undeserved contempt. Dr. Eck wrote in three days a refutation, [723]
   slanderously charging Zwingli that for ten years he had labored to root
   out from the people of Switzerland all faith and all religion, and to
   stir them, up against the magistrate; that he had caused greater
   devastation among them than the Turks, Tartars, and Huns; that he had
   turned the churches and convents founded by the Hapsburgers (the
   Emperor's ancestors) into temples of Venus and Bacchus; and that he now
   completed his crime by daring to appear before the Emperor with such an
   impudent piece of writing. The Lutherans (with the exception of Philip
   of Hesse, who sympathized with Zwingli) were scarcely less indignant,
   and much more anxious to conciliate the Catholics than to appear in
   league with Zwinglians and Anabaptists. They felt especially offended
   that the Swiss Reformer took strong ground against the corporeal
   presence, and incidentally alluded to them as persons who 'were looking
   back to the flesh-pots of Egypt.' [724] Melanchthon, who was at that
   time not yet emancipated from the Catholic tradition on that article,
   judged him insane. [725]

   Zwingli, having had no time to consult with his confederates, offered
   the Confession in his own name, and submitted it to the judgment of the
   whole Church of Christ, under the guidance of the Word of God and the
   Holy Spirit.

   In the first sections he declares, as clearly and even more explicitly
   than the Lutheran Confession, his faith in the orthodox doctrines of
   the Trinity and the Person of Christ, as laid down in the Nicene and
   Athanasian Creeds (which are expressly named). He teaches the election
   by free grace, the sole and sufficient satisfaction of Christ, and
   justification by faith, in opposition to all human mediators and
   meritorious works. He distinguishes between the internal or invisible,
   and the external or visible Church; the former is the company of the
   elect believers and their children, and is the bride of Christ; the
   latter embraces all nominal Christians and their children, and is
   beautifully described in the parable of the Ten Virgins, of whom five
   were foolish. Church may also designate a single congregation, as the
   church in Rome, in Augsburg, in Leyden. The true Church can never err
   in the foundation of faith. Purgatory he rejects as an injurious
   fiction which sets Christ's merits at naught. On original sin, the
   salvation of unbaptized infants, and the sacraments, he departs much
   further from the traditional theology than the Lutherans. He goes into
   a lengthy argument against the corporeal presence in the eucharist. On
   the other hand, however, he protests against being confounded with the
   Anabaptists, and rejects their views on infant baptism, civil offices,
   the sleep of the soul, and universal salvation.

   The document is frank and bold, yet dignified and courteous, and
   concludes thus: 'Hinder not, ye children of men, the spread and growth
   of the Word of God--ye can not forbid the grass to grow. Ye must see
   that this plant is richly blessed with rain from heaven. Consider not
   your own wishes, but the demands of the age concerning the free course
   of the gospel. Take these words kindly, and show by your deeds that you
   are children of God.'

   4. The Exposition of the Christian Faith to King Francis I. [726]

   This is, as Bullinger says, the swan song of Zwingli, in which he
   surpassed himself. He wrote it in July, 1531, three months before his
   death, at the request of his friend Maigret, the French ambassador to
   Switzerland, and sent it in manuscript to Francis I., King of France
   (1515-1547), who, from political motives, showed himself favorable to
   the Protestants in Germany and Switzerland, while he persecuted them at
   home. A few years before he had dedicated to him his 'Commentary on the
   true and false Religion' (1525), and a few years afterwards (1536)
   Calvin dedicated to him his Institutes, with a most eloquent and
   powerful letter; but the frivolous monarch probably never read these
   voices of warning, which, if properly heeded, might have changed the
   whole history of France.

   This last document of Zwingli is clear, bold, spirited, full of faith
   and hope. In a brief preface he warns the most Christian King of France
   against the lies and slanders circulated against the Protestants. He
   first treats of God, the ultimate ground of our faith and only object
   of worship. We do not despise the saints and sacraments, we only guard
   them against abuse; we honor Mary as the perpetual Virgin and Mother of
   God, [727] but we do not worship her in the proper sense of the term,
   which we know she herself would never tolerate. The sacraments we honor
   as signs or symbols of holy things, but not as the holy things
   themselves. Then he speaks of the holy Trinity, and the incarnation of
   the eternal Son of God for our salvation, who made a full satisfaction
   for all our sins. He gives an able exposition of the two natures in the
   one person of Christ, his death, resurrection, ascension, and return to
   judgment. He rejects purgatory as a papal fiction. He dwells very fully
   on the doctrine of the Sacraments, especially the eucharistic presence
   (rejecting ubiquity). The remaining chapters are devoted to the Church,
   the Magistrate, the remission of sins, faith and works, eternal life,
   and an attack on the Anabaptists, with whom the Protestants were often
   confounded in France. In conclusion, he entreats the king to give the
   gospel free course in his kingdom; to imitate the example of some pious
   princes in Germany; to judge by the fruits of the Reformed faith
   wherever it was fairly established; and to forgive the boldness with
   which he approached his majesty. The urgency of the case demanded it.
   An appendix is devoted to the mass, with proofs from the fathers,
   especially from Augustine, in favor of his view on the Lord's Supper.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [715] See Zwingli's poems, written during the pestilence, in Hagenbach,
   1.c. p. 216, and another, p. 404. He published a moral poem, under the
   title The Labyrinth, as early as 1510, while priest at Glarus (Opera,
   Tom. II. B. pp. 243 sqq.; Mörikofer, Vol. I. pp. 13 sqq.). His
   preference for Puritanic simplicity in public worship gave rise to the
   fiction of his hostility to music. He was, on the contrary, singularly
   skilled in that art, and was called in derision by the Papists 'the
   evangelical lute-player.' A contemporary says that he never knew a man
   who could play on so many musical instruments--the lute, the harp, the
   violin, etc. [Zwingli's copy of the N. T. was confined to Paul's
   epistles and Hebrews.--Ed.]

   [716] Once, at least, Luther speaks kindly of Zwingli, in a letter to
   Bullinger, of Zurich, May 14, 1588 (De Wette, Vol. V. p. 112): 'Libere
   enim dicam: Zwinglium, postquam Marpurgi mihi visus et auditus est,
   virum optimum esse judicavi, sicut et OEcolampadium.' In the same
   letter he says that Zwingli's death caused him much pain. But this
   personal respect did not prevent him from using the most violent
   language against his doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which he held in
   utter abhorrence to the last, and this all the more because his
   fanatical colleague Carlstadt, who gave him infinite trouble, had first
   proposed and defended it by an untenable exegesis. This accounts also
   for his absurd charge of fanaticism against the clear, sober-minded,
   jejune Zwingli. 'Es ist fast lächerlich,' says the mild and impartial
   Hagenbach (p. 280), 'wenn Luther mitten in seiner schwärmerisch
   tobenden Leidenschaft den ehrlichen Zwingli einen Schärmer nennt, ihn,
   der von aller Schwärmerei so fern war. Es sei denn, dass man den
   idealistischen Zug in ihm (und der war allerdings dem derben Realismus
   Luthers zuwider) mit diesem Namen bezeichnen wolle. Man betrachte auch
   nur sein Bildniss! Dieser energische, feste, satte Kopf, diese in Stein
   gehauene, markante Physiognomie, diese breite Stirn, dieses volle klare
   Auge, diesen geschlossenen Mund mit runden Lippen--genug! ich überlasse
   einem Lavater die vollendete Deutung des Bildes (der in ihm "Ernst,
   Nachdenken, männliche Entschlossenheit, eine sich zusammenziehende
   Thatkraft, einen schauenden, durchdringenden Verstand" erkennt), und
   berufe mich allein auf die Geschichte, welche den lebendigen Commentar
   zu diesem Bildniss ausmacht.'

   [717] On the relation of Luther and Zwingli, see Ebrard, Vol. II. pp.
   214 sqq.; Hagenbach, pp. 278 sqq.; and an essay of Hundeshagen in the
   Studien und Kritiken for 1862. Zwingli himself thus described his
   relation to Luther in 1523, when the German Papists began to denounce
   his doctrine as a Lutheran heresy: 'Ich habe, ehe noch ein Mensch in
   unserer Gegend etwas von Luther's Namen gewusst hat, angefangen das
   Evangelium Christi zu predigen, im Jahr 1516. Wer schalt mich damals
   lutherisch? . . . Luther's Name ist mir noch zwei Jahre unbekannt
   gewesen, nachdem ich mich allein an die Bibel gehalten habe. Aber es
   ist, wie gesagt, nur ihre Schlauheit, dass die Päpstler mich und Andere
   mit solchem Namen beladen. Sprechen sie: Du musst wohl lutherisch sein,
   du predigest ja, wie Luther schreibt; so ist meine Antwort: Ich predige
   ja auch wie Paulus; warum nennst du mich nicht vielmehr einen
   Paulisten? . . . Meines Erachtens ist Luther ein trefflicher Streiter
   Gottes, der da mit so grossem Ernste die Schrift durchforscht, als seit
   tausend Jahren irgend einer auf Erden gewesen ist. Mit dem männlichen,
   unbewegten Gemüthe, womit er den Papst von Rom angegriffen hat, ist ihm
   keiner nie gleich geworden, so lange das Papstthum gewähret hat, alle
   Andern ungescholten. Wessen aber ist solche That? Gottes oder Luthers?
   Frage den Luther selbst, gewiss sagt er dir: Gottes. Warum schreibst du
   denn anderer Menschen Lehre dem Luther zu, da er sie selbst Gott
   zuschreibt, und nichts Neues hervorbringt, sondern was in dem ewigen,
   unveränderlichen Worte Gottes enthalten ist? Fromme Christen! gebet
   nicht zu, dass der ehrliche Name Christi verwandelt werde in den Namen
   Luthers; denn Luther ist für uns nicht gestorben, sondern er lehrt uns
   den erkennen, von dem wir allein alles Heil haben. Predigt Luther
   Christum, so thut er's grade wie ich; wiewohl, Gott sei Dank! durch ihn
   eine unzählbare Menge mehr als durch mich und Andere, denen Gott ihr
   Mass grösser oder kleiner macht, zu Gott geführt wird. Ich will keinen
   Namen tragen, als meines Hauptmannes Jesu Christi, dessen Streiter ich
   bin. . . . Es kann kein Mensch sein, der Luther höher achtet, als ich.
   Dennoch bezeuge ich vor Gott und allen Menschen, dass ich all' meine
   Tage nie einen Buchstaben an ihn geschrieben habe, noch er an mich,
   noch verschafft, dass geschrieben werde. Ich habe es unterlassen, nicht
   dass ich jemand desswegen gefürchtet, sondern weil ich damit allen
   Menschen habe zeigen wollen, wie gleichförmig der Geist Gottes sei, da
   wir so welt von einander entfernt und doch einmüthig sind, aber ohne
   alle Verabredung, wiewohl ich ihm nicht zuzuzählen bin; denn jeder
   thut, soviel ihm Gott weiset.'

   Instruction' which Zwingli wrote in the name of the Magistrate of
   Zurich, Sept. 1523, for the preachers and pastors, treating of the
   Gospel and the Law, of Images, and of the Mass (pp. 13-34).

   § 52. Zwingli's Distinctive Doctrines.

   Zwingli's doctrines are laid down chiefly in his two Confessions to
   Charles V. and Francis I. (§ 51), his Commentarius de vera et falsa
   religione (1525), and his sermon De Providentia Dei (1530).

   Of secondary doctrinal importance are the Explanation of his Articles
   and Conclusions (1523); his Shepherd (a sort of pastoral theology);
   several tracts and letters on the Lord's Supper, on Baptism and
   re-Baptism; and his Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, the Gospels, the
   Romans, and Corinthians (edited, from his lectures and sermons, by Leo
   Judä, Megander, and others).

   Zwingli's theological system contains, in germ, the main features of
   the Reformed Creed, as distinct from the Lutheran, and must be here
   briefly considered.

   1. Zwingli begins with the objective (or formal) principle of
   Protestantism, namely, the exclusive and absolute authority of the
   Bible in all matters of Christian faith and practice. The Reformed
   Confessions do the same; while the Lutheran Confessions start with the
   subjective (or material) principle of justification by faith alone, and
   make this 'the article of the standing and falling Church.' This
   difference, however, is more a matter of logical order and relative
   importance. Word and faith are inseparable, and proceed from the same
   Holy Spirit. In both denominations a living faith in Christ is the
   first and last principle. Without this faith the Bible may be esteemed
   as the best book, but not as the inspired word of God and rule of
   faith.

   2. Zwingli teaches the doctrine of unconditional election or
   predestination to salvation (constitutio de beandis, as he defines it),
   and finds in it the ultimate ground of our justification and salvation;
   faith being only the organ of appropriation. God is the infinite being
   of beings, in whom and through whom all other beings exist; the supreme
   cause, including as dependent organs the finite or middle causes; the
   infinite and only good (Luke xviii. 18), and every thing else is good
   (Gen. i. 31) only through and in him. It is a fundamental canon that
   God by his providence, or perpetual and unchangeable rule and
   administration, [728] controls and disposes all events, the will and
   the action; otherwise he would not be omnipotent and omnipresent. There
   can be no accident. The fall, with its consequences, likewise comes
   under his foreknowledge and fore-ordination, which can be as little
   separated as intellect and will. But God's agency in respect to sin is
   free from sin, since he is not bound by law, and has no bad motive or
   affection; so the magistrate may take a man's life without committing
   murder. [729] But only those who hear the Gospel and reject it in
   unbelief are foreordained to eternal punishment. Of those without the
   reach of Christian doctrine we can not judge, as we know not their
   relation to election. There may be and are elect persons among the
   heathen; and the fate of Socrates and Seneca is no doubt better than
   that of many popes.

   Zwingli, however, dwells mainly on the positive aspect of God's
   providence--the election to salvation. Election is free and
   independent. It embraces also infants before they have any faith. It
   does not follow faith, but precedes it. Faith is itself the work of
   free grace and the sign and fruit of election (Rom. viii. 29, 30; Acts
   xiii. 48). We are elected in order that we may believe in Christ and
   bring forth the fruits of holiness. Faith is trust and confidence in
   Christ, the union of the soul with him, and full of good works. Hence
   it is preposterous to charge this doctrine with dangerous tendency to
   carnal security and immorality. [730]

   This is substantially Zwingli's doctrine, as he preached it during the
   Conference in Marburg (1529), and taught it in his book on Providence
   [731] It was afterwards more fully and clearly developed by the
   powerful intellect of Calvin, [732] who made it the prominent pillar of
   his theology and impressed it upon the majority of the Reformed
   Confessions, although several of them simply teach a free election to
   salvation, without saying a word of the decree of reprobation.

   On this subject, however, as previously stated, there was no
   controversy among the early Reformers. They were all Augustinians.
   Luther heard Zwingli's sermon on Providence in Marburg, and made no
   objection to it, except that he quoted Greek and Hebrew in the pulpit.
   He had expressed himself much more strongly on the subject in his
   famous book against Erasmus (1525). There was, however, this
   difference, that Luther, like Augustine, from his denial of the freedom
   of the human will, was driven to the doctrine of absolute
   predestination, as a logical consequence; while Zwingli, and still more
   Calvin, started from the absolute sovereignty of God, and inferred from
   it the dependence of the human will; yet all of them were controlled by
   their strong sense of sin and free grace much more than by speculative
   principles. The Lutheran Church afterwards dropped the theological
   inference in part--namely, the decree of reprobation--and taught
   instead the universality of the offer of saving grace; but she retained
   the anthropological premise of total depravity and inability, and also
   the doctrine of a free election of the saints, or predestination to
   salvation; and this after all is the chief point in the Calvinistic
   system, and the only one which is made the subject of popular
   instruction. In the Lutheran Church, morever, the election theory is
   moderated by the sacramental principle of baptismal regeneration (as
   was the case with Augustine), while in the Reformed Church the doctrine
   of election controls and modifies the sacramental principle, so that
   the efficacy of baptism is made to depend upon the preceding election.

   3. The most original and prominent doctrine of Zwingli is that of the
   sacraments, and especially of the Lord's Supper.

   He adopts the general definition that the sacrament is the visible sign
   of an invisible grace, but draws a sharp distinction between the
   sacramental sign (signum) and the thing signified (res sacramenti), and
   allows no necessary and internal connection between them. The baptism
   by water may take place without the baptism of the Spirit (as in the
   case of Ananias and Simon Magus), and the baptism by the Spirit, or
   regeneration, without the baptism by water (for the apostles received
   only John's baptism; the penitent thief was not baptized at all, and
   Cornelius was baptized after regeneration). Communion with Christ is
   not confined to the Lord's Supper, neither do all who partake of this
   ordinance really commune with Christ. The Spirit of God is free and
   independent of all outward ceremonies and observances.

   As to the effect of the sacraments, Zwingli rejects the whole
   scholastic theory of the opus operatum, and makes faith the necessary
   medium of sacramental efficacy. He differs here not only from the
   Romish, but also from the Lutheran theory. He regards the sacraments
   only as signs and seals, and not strictly as means or instrumentalities
   of grace, except in so far as they strengthen it. They do not originate
   and confer grace, but presuppose it, and set it forth to our senses,
   and confirm it to our faith. As circumcision sealed the righteousness
   of the faith of Abraham, which he had before in a state of
   uncircumcision (Rom. iv. 11), so baptism seals the remission of sin by
   the cleansing blood of Christ, and our incorporation in Christ by
   faith, which is produced by the Holy Spirit. In infant baptism (which
   he strongly defended against the Anabaptists, not indeed as necessary
   to salvation, but as proper and expedient), we have the divine promise
   which extends to the offspring, and the profession of the faith of the
   parents with their pledge to bring up their children in the same. The
   Lord's Supper signifies and seals the fact that Christ died for us and
   shed his blood for our sins, that he is ours and we are his, and that
   we are partakers of all his benefits. Zwingli compares the sacrament
   also to a wedding-ring which seals the marriage union.

   He fully admits, however, that the sacraments are divinely instituted
   and necessary for our twofold constitution; that they are significant
   and efficacious, not empty, signs; that they aid and strengthen our
   faith ('auxilium opemque adferunt fidei'), and so far confer spiritual
   blessing through the medium of appropriating faith. In this wider sense
   they may be called means of grace. He also gives them the character of
   public testimonies, by which we openly profess our faith before God and
   the world, pledge our obedience to him, and express our gratitude for
   mercies received. Hence the name eucharist, or gratiarum actio.

   Concerning the Lord's Supper, Zwingli teaches, in opposition to the
   Romish mass, that it is a commemoration, not a repetition, of the
   atoning sacrifice of Christ, who offered himself once for all time, and
   can not be offered by any other; that bread and wine signify or
   represent, but are not really, the broken body and shed blood of our
   Lord; that he is present only according to his divine nature and by his
   Spirit to the eye of faith (fidei contemplatione), but not according to
   his human nature, which is in heaven at the right hand of God, and can
   not be present every where or in many places at the same time; that to
   eat his flesh and to drink his blood is a spiritual manducation, or the
   same as to believe in him (John vi.), and no physical manducation by
   mouth and teeth, which, even if it were possible, would be useless and
   unworthy and would establish two ways of salvation--one by faith, the
   other by literal eating in the sacrament; finally, that the blessing of
   the ordinance consists in a renewed application of the benefits of the
   atonement by the worthy or believing communicants, while the unworthy
   receive only the outward signs to their own judgment.

   He therefore rejects every form of a local or corporeal presence,
   whether by transubstantiation, impanation, or consubstantiation, as
   contrary to the Bible, to the nature of faith, and to sound reason. He
   supports the figurative interpretation of the words of institution
   [733] by a large number of passages, where Christ is said to be the
   door, the lamb, the rock, the vine, etc.; also by such passages as Gen.
   xli. 26, 27 (the seven good kine are seven years), Matt. xiii. 31-37
   (the field is the world; the tares are the children of the wicked one;
   the reapers are the angels), and especially Luke xxii. 20; 1 Cor. xi.
   25 (the cup is the New Testament in my blood). He proves the local
   absence of Christ's body by the fact of his ascension to heaven, his
   future visible return to judgment, and by such passages as, 'I go to
   prepare a place for you;' 'The poor you have always with you, but me
   you have not always;' 'I go to my Father;' 'The heaven must receive him
   until the times of restitution of all things.' He also points out the
   inconsistency of Luther in maintaining the literal presence of Christ
   in the sacrament, and yet refusing the adoration; for wherever Christ
   is he must be adored.

   I add his last words on the subject from the Confession sent to King
   Francis I. shortly before his death: 'We believe that Christ is truly
   present in the Lord's Supper; yea, we believe that there is no
   communion without the presence of Christ. [734] This is the proof:
   "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them" (Matt. xviii. 20). How much more is he present where the
   whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is
   literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is
   contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the
   world" (John xvii. 11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing" (John vi.
   63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still
   believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and
   true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence,
   which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would
   shrink from eating his beloved son. . . . We believe that the true body
   of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual
   manner by the religions, believing, and pious heart (as also St.
   Chrysostom taught). And this is in brief the substance of what we
   maintain in this controversy, and what not we, but the truth itself
   teaches.' To this he adds the communion service, which he introduced in
   Zurich, that his Majesty may see how devoutly the sacrament is
   celebrated there in accordance with the institution of Christ. This
   service is much more liturgical than the later Calvinistic formulas,
   and includes the 'Gloria in Excelsis,' the Apostles' Creed, and
   responses.

   Closely connected with the eucharistic controversy are certain
   christological differences concerning ubiquity and the communicatio
   idiomatum, which we have already discussed in the section on the
   Formula of Concord.

   Zwingli's doctrine of the Eucharist is unquestionably the simplest,
   clearest, and most intelligible theory. It removes the supernatural
   mystery from the ordinance, and presents no obstacles to the
   understanding. Exegetically, it is admissible, and advocated even by
   some of the ablest Lutheran scholars, who freely concede that the
   literal interpretation of the words of institution, to which Luther
   appealed first and last against the arguments of Zwingli, is
   impossible, or, if consistently carried out, must lead to the Romish
   dogma. [735] Philosophically and dogmatically, it labors under none of
   the difficulties of transubstantiation and consubstantiation, both of
   which imply the simultaneous multipresence of a corporeal substance,
   and a physical manducation of Christ's crucified body and blood--in
   direct contradiction to the essential properties of a body, and the
   testimony of four of our senses. It has been adopted by the Arminians,
   and it extensively prevails at present even among orthodox Protestants
   of all denominations, especially in England and America. [736]

   Zwingli is no doubt right in his protest against every form, however
   refined and subtle, of the old Capernaitic conception of a carnal
   presence and carnal appropriation (John vi. 63). He is also right in
   his positive assertion that the holy communion is a commemoration of
   the all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ on the cross, and a spiritual
   feeding on Christ by faith. But he falls short of the whole truth; he
   does not do justice to the strong language of our Lord, especially in
   John vi. 53-58, concerning the eating of the flesh of the Son of Man
   (whether this be referred directly or indirectly to the Lord's Supper,
   or not). After all deduction of carnal misconceptions, there remains
   the mystery of a vital union of the believer with the whole Christ,
   including his humanity, viewed not, indeed, as material substance, but
   as a principle of life and power.

   This Calvin felt. Hence he endeavored to find a via media between
   Zwingli and Luther, and assumed, besides the admitted real presence of
   the Divine Lord, a dynamic presence and influence of his glorified and
   ever-living humanity, and an actual communication of its life-giving
   power (not the matter of the body and blood) by the Holy Ghost to the
   worthy communicant through the medium of faith--as the sun is in the
   heavens, and yet with his light and heat present on earth. This theory
   passed substantially into the most authoritative confessions of the
   sixteenth century, and must therefore be regarded as the orthodox
   doctrine of the Reformed Church.

   On three other points--namely, original sin, the salvation of infants,
   and the salvation of the heathen--Zwingli had peculiar views, which
   were in advance of his age, and gave great offense to some of his
   friends as well as to Luther, but were afterwards adopted by the
   Arminians.

   4. The Reformation was born of an intense conviction of the sinfulness
   of man and the absolute need of a radical regeneration. Zwingli makes
   no exception, and describes the corruption and slavery of the natural
   man almost as strongly as Luther, although he never passed through such
   terrors of conscience as the monk in Erfurt, nor had he such
   hand-to-hand fights with the devil. [737] He derives sin from the fall
   of Adam, brought about by the instigation of the devil, and finds its
   essence in selfishness as opposed to the love of God. He goes beyond
   the Augustinian infralapsarianism, which seems to condition the eternal
   counsel of God by the first self-determination of man, and he boldly
   takes the supralapsarian position that God not only foresaw, but
   foreordained the fall, together with the redemption, that is, as a
   means to an end, or as the negative condition for the revelation of the
   plan of salvation. He fully admits the distinction between original or
   hereditary sin and actual transgression, but he describes the former as
   a moral disease, or natural defect, rather than punishable sin and
   guilt. [738] It is a miserable condition (conditio misera). He compares
   it to the misfortune of one born in slavery. [739] But if not sin in
   the proper sense of the term, it is an inclination or propensity to sin
   (propensio ad peccandum), and the fruitful germ of sin, which will
   surely develop itself in actual transgression. Thus the young wolf is a
   rapacious animal before he actually tears the sheep.

   5. Zwingli was the first to emancipate the salvation of children dying
   in infancy from the supposed indispensable condition of water-baptism,
   and to extend it beyond the boundaries of the visible Church. This is a
   matter of very great interest, since the unbaptized children far
   outnumber the baptized, and constitute nearly one half of the race.

   He teaches repeatedly that all elect children are saved whether
   baptized or not, whether of Christian or heathen parentage, not on the
   ground of their innocence (which would be Pelagian), but on the ground
   of Christ's atonement. He is inclined to the belief that all children
   dying in infancy belong to the elect; their early death being a token
   of God's mercy, and hence of their election. A part of the elect are
   led to salvation by a holy life, another part by an early death. The
   children of Christian parents belong to the Church, and it would be
   'impious' to condemn them. But from the parallel between the first and
   the second Adam, he infers that all children are saved from the ruin of
   sin, else what Paul says would not be true, that 'as in Adam all die,
   even so in Christ shall all be made alive' (1 Cor. xv. 22). At all
   events, it is wrong to condemn the children of the heathen, both on
   account of the restoration of Christ and of the eternal election of
   God, which precedes faith, and produces faith in due time; hence the
   absence of faith in children is no ground for their condemnation. [740]
   As he believed in the salvation of many adult heathen, he had the less
   difficulty in believing that heathen children are saved; for they have
   not yet committed actual transgression, and of hereditary sin they have
   been redeemed by Christ. We have therefore much greater certainty of
   the salvation of departed infants than of any adults.

   This view was a bold step beyond the traditional orthodoxy. The Roman
   Catholic Church, in keeping with her doctrine of original sin and
   guilt, and the necessity of water-baptism for salvation (based upon
   Mark xvi. 16 and John iii. 5), teaches the salvation of all baptized,
   and the condemnation of all unbaptized children; assigning the latter
   to the limbus infantum on the border of hell, where they suffer the
   mildest kind of punishment, namely, the negative penalty of loss (poena
   damni or carentia beatificæ visionis), but not the positive pain of
   feeling (poena sensus). [741] St. Augustine first clearly introduced
   this wholesale exclusion of all unbaptized infants from heaven--though
   Christ expressly says that to children emphatically belongs the kingdom
   of heaven. He ought consistently to have made the salvation of infants,
   like that of adults, depend upon their election; but the churchly and
   sacramental principle checked and moderated his predestination theory,
   and his Christian heart induced him to soften the frightful dogma as
   much as possible. [742] As he did not extend election beyond the
   boundaries of the Catholic Church (although he could not help seeing
   the significance of such holy outsiders as Melchizedek and Job under
   the old dispensation), he secured at least, by his high view of the
   regenerative efficacy of water-baptism, the salvation of all baptized
   infants dying in infancy. To harmonize this view with his system, he
   must have counted them all among the elect.

   The Lutheran Creed retains substantially the Catholic view of baptismal
   regeneration, and hence limits infant salvation to those who enjoy this
   means of grace; [743] allowing, however, some exceptions within the
   sphere of the Christian Church, and making the damnation of unbaptized
   infants as mild as the case will permit. [744] At present, however,
   there is scarcely a Lutheran divine of weight who would be willing to
   confine salvation to baptized infants.

   The Reformed Church teaches the salvation of all elect infants dying in
   infancy, whether baptized or not, and assumes that they are regenerated
   before their death, which, according to Calvinistic principles, is
   possible without water-baptism. [745] The second Scotch Confession, of
   1580, expressly rejects, among other errors of popery,' the cruel
   judgment against infants departing without the sacrament.' [746] Beyond
   this the Confessions do not go, and leave the mysterious subject to
   private opinion. Some of the older and more rigid Calvinistic divines
   of the supralapsarian type carried the distinction between the elect
   and the reprobate into the infant world, though always securing
   salvation to the offspring of Christian parents, on the ground of
   inherited Church membership before and independent of the baptismal
   ratification; while others more wisely and charitably kept silence, or
   left the non-elect infants--if there are such, which nobody knows--to
   the uncovenanted mercies of God. But we may still go a step further,
   within the strict limits of the Reformed Creed, and maintain, as a
   pious opinion, that all departed infants belong to the number of the
   elect. Their early removal from a world of sin and temptation may be
   taken as an indication of God's special favor. From this it would
   follow that the majority of the human race will be saved. The very
   doctrine of election, which is unlimitable and free of all ordinary
   means, at all events widens the possibility and strengthens the
   probability of general infant salvation; while those Churches which
   hold to the necessity of baptismal regeneration must either
   consistently exclude from heaven all unbaptized infants (even those of
   Christian Baptists and Quakers), or, yielding to the instinct of
   Christian charity, they must make exceptions so innumerable that these
   would become, in fact, the rule, and overthrow the principle
   altogether.

   In the seventeenth century the Arminians resumed the position of
   Zwingli, and with their mild theory of original sin (which they do not
   regard as responsible and punishable before and independent of actual
   transgression), they could consistently teach the general salvation of
   infants. The Methodists and Baptists adopted the same view. Even in the
   strictly Calvinistic churches it made steady progress, and is now
   silently or openly held by nearly all Reformed divines. [747]

   Whether consistent or not, the doctrine of infant damnation is
   certainly cruel and revolting to every nobler and better feeling of our
   nature. It can not be charged upon the Bible except by logical
   inference from a few passages (John iii. 5; Mark xvi. 16; Rom. v. 12),
   which admit of a different interpretation. On the other hand, the
   general salvation of infants, though not expressly taught, is far more
   consistent with the love of God, the genius of Christianity, and the
   spirit and conduct of him who shed his precious blood for all ages of
   mankind, who held up little children to his own disciples as models of
   simplicity and trustfulness, and took them to his bosom, blessing them,
   and saying (unconditionally and before Christian baptism did exist),
   'Of such is the kingdom of heaven,' and 'Whosoever shall not receive
   the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in nowise enter
   therein.'

   6. Salvation of adult heathen. This is a still darker problem. Before
   Zwingli it was the universal opinion that there can be no salvation
   outside of the visible Church (extra ecclesiam nulla satus). Dante, the
   poet of mediæval Catholicism, assigns even Homer, Aristotle, Virgil, to
   hell, which bears the terrible inscription--

   'Let those who enter in dismiss all hope.'

   But the Swiss Reformer repeatedly expressed his conviction, to which he
   adhered to the last, that God had his elect among the Gentiles as well
   as the Jews, and that, together with the saints of the Old Testament
   from the redeemed Adam down to John the Baptist, we may expect to find
   in heaven also such sages as Socrates, Plato, Aristides, Pindar, Numa,
   Cato, Scipio, Seneca; in short, every good and holy man and faithful
   soul from the beginning of the world to the end. [748]

   For this liberality he was severely censured. The great and good Luther
   was horrified at the idea that even 'the godless Numa' (!) should be
   saved, and thought that it falsified the whole gospel, without which
   there can be no salvation. [749]

   Zwingli, notwithstanding his abhorrence of heathen idolatry and every
   relic of paganism in worship, retained, from his classical training in
   the school of Erasmus, a great admiration for the wisdom and the manly
   virtues of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and was somewhat unguarded in
   his mode of expression. But he had no idea of sending any one to heaven
   without the atonement, although he does not state when and how it was
   applied to those who died before the incarnation. In his mind the
   eternal election was inseparably connected with the plan of the
   Christian redemption. He probably assumed an unconscious Christianity
   among the better heathen, and a secret work of grace in their hearts,
   which enabled them to exercise a general faith in God and to strive
   after good works (comp. Rom. ii. 7, 10, 14, 15). All truth, he says,
   proceeds from the Spirit of God. He might have appealed to Justin
   Martyr and other ancient fathers, who traced all that was true and good
   among the Greek philosophers and poets to the working of the Logos
   before his incarnation (John i. 5, 10). [750]

   During the period of rigorous scholastic orthodoxy which followed the
   Reformation in the Reformed and Lutheran Churches, Zwingli's view could
   not be appreciated, and appeared as a dangerous heresy. In the
   seventeenth century the Romanists excluded the Protestants, the
   Lutherans the Calvinists, the Calvinists the Arminians, from the
   kingdom of heaven; how much more all those who never heard of Christ.
   This wholesale damnation of the vast majority of the human race should
   have stirred up a burning zeal for their conversion; and yet during
   that whole period of intense confessionalism and exclusive orthodoxism
   there was not a single Protestant missionary in the field except among
   the Indians in the wilderness of North America. [751]

   But in modern times Zwingli's view has been revived and applauded as a
   noble testimony of his liberality, especially among evangelical divines
   in Germany, and partly in connection with a new theory of Hades and the
   middle state.

   This is not the place to discuss a point which, in the absence of clear
   Scripture authority, does not admit of symbolical statement. The future
   fate of the heathen is wisely involved in mystery, and it is unsafe and
   useless to speculate without the light of revelation about matters
   which lie beyond the reach of our observation and experience. But the
   Bible consigns no one to final damnation, except for rejecting Christ
   in unbelief, [752] and gives us at least a ray of hope by significant
   examples of faith from Melchizedek and Job down to the wise men from
   the East, and by a number of passages concerning the working of the
   Logos among the Gentiles (John i. 5, 10; Rom. i. 19; ii. 14, 15, 18,
   19; Acts xvii. 23, 28; 1 Pet. iii. 19; iv. 6). We certainly have no
   right to confine God's election and saving grace to the limits of the
   visible Church. We are indeed bound to his ordinances and must submit
   to his terms of salvation; but God himself is free, and can save
   whomsoever and howsoever he pleases, and he is infinitely more anxious
   and ready to save than we can conceive.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [728] Zwingli defines providentia to be perpetuum et immutabile rerum
   universarum regnum et administratio.

   [729] This illustration is used by Myconius in defending the Zwinglian
   view of Providence. See Schweizer, Centraldogmen, Vol. I. p. 133. The
   illustration of Zwingli, Opp. IV. p. 112, concerning the adulterium
   Davidis and the taurus, is less happy.

   [730] As a matter of history, it is an undeniable fact that the
   strongest predestinarians (whether Augustinians or Calvinists or
   Puritans) have been the most earnest, energetic, and persevering
   Christians. Edward Zeller (a cool philosopher and critic of the
   Tübingen school) clearly explains this connection in his book on the
   Theological System of Zwingli, pp. 17-19: 'Gerade die Lehre von der
   Erwählung, der man so oft vorgeworfen hat, dass sie die sittliche Kraft
   lähme, dass sie zu Trägheit and Sorglosigheit hinführe, gerade diese
   Lehre ist es, aus welcher der Reformirte jene rücksichts- und
   zweifellose, bis zur Härte und Leidenschaftlichkeit durchgreifende
   praktische Energie schöpft, wie wir sie an den Helden dieses Glaubens,
   einem Zwingli, einem Calvin, einem Farel, einem Knox, einem Cromwell,
   bewundern, welche ihn vor den Zweifeln und Anfechtungen bewahrt, die
   dem weicheren, tiefer mit sich selbst beschäftigten Gemüth so viel zu
   schaffen machen, von denen selbst der grosse deutsche Glaubensheld
   Luther noch in späten Jahren heimgesucht wurde. Die wesentliche
   religiöse Bedeutung dieser Lehre, ihre Bedeutung für das innere Leben
   der Gläubigen, liegt nicht in der Ueberzeuzung von der Unbedingtheit
   des göttlichen Wirkens als solchen, sondern in dem Glauben an seine
   Unbedingtheit in seiner Richtung auf dieses bestimmte Subjekt in jener
   persönlichen Gewissheit der Erwählung, welche den Unterschied der
   reformirten Erwählungslehre von der augustinischen ausmacht, und eben
   darauf beruht es auch, dass die theoretisch ganz richtigen Konsequenzen
   des Prädestinatianismus in Beziehung auf die Nutzlosigkeit und
   Gleichgültigkeit des eigenen Thuns den Reformirten nicht blos nicht
   stören, sondern gar nicht für ihn vorhanden sind. Was er in den Sätzen
   von der ewigen Vorherbestimmung aller Dinge, von dem unwandelbaren
   Rathschluss der Erwählung und der Verwerfung, für sich selbst findet,
   das ist nur die unzweifelhafte Gewissheit, persönlich zum Dienst Gottes
   berufen zu sein, und vermöge dieser Berufung in allen seinen
   Angelegenheiten unter dem unmittelbarsten Schutz Gottes zu stehen, als
   Werkzeug Gottes zu handeln, der Seligkeit gewiss zu sein. Die
   Heilsgewissheit ist hier von der sittlich religiösen Anforderung nicht
   getrennt, der Einzelne hat das Bewusstsein seiner Berufung nur in
   seinem Glauben, und den Glauben nur in der Kräftigkeit seines
   gottbeseelten Willens, er ist sich nicht seiner Erwählung zur Seligkeit
   ohne alle weitere Bestimmung, sondern wesentlich nur seiner Erwählung
   zu der Seligkeit des christlichen Lebens bewusst; die Erwählung ist
   hier nur die Unterlage für das praktische Verhalten des Frommen, der
   Mensch verzichtet nur desshalb im Dogma auf die Kraft und Freiheit
   seines Willens, um sie für das wirkliche Leben und Handeln von der
   Gottheit, an die er sich ihrer entäussert hat, als eine absolute, als
   die Kraft des göttlichen Geistes, als die unerschütterliche
   Selbstgewissheit des Erwählten zurückzuerhalten.'

   [731] Zwingli, being requested by Philip of Hesse (Jan. 25, 1530) to
   send him a copy of his sermon, which he had preached without
   manuscript, reproduced the substance of it, and sent it to him, Aug.
   20, 1530. under the title, Ad illustrissimum Cattorum principem
   Philippum sermonis de Providentia Dei anamnema. Opera IV. pp. 79-144.
   See a full extract in Schweizer's Centraldogmen, Vol. I. pp. 102 sqq.
   Ebrard makes too little account of this tract.

   [732] In the later editions of his Institutes; for in the first edition
   he confines himself to a very brief and indefinite statement of this
   doctrine.

   [733] That is, of the verbal copula esti, est=significat, not of touto
   (Carlstadt), nor soma= figura corporis (OEcolampadius, on the ground
   that Christ probably did not use the verb at all in the original
   Aramaic). Zwingli was always inclined to a tropical interpretation, and
   averse to the notion of a carnal presence, but was led to his exegesis
   in 1522 by a tract of Honius (Hoen), a lawyer of Holland, De
   eucharistia, which taught him in qua voce tropus lateret. See Ebrard,
   Vol. II. p. 97. His controversy with Luther began when he wrote a
   letter to Matth. Alber, at Reutlingen, Nov. 16, 1524.

   [734] 'Christum credimus vere esse in coena, immo non credimus esse
   Domini coenam nisi Christus adsit.' Niemeyer, p. 71.

   [735] See above, p. 327.

   [736] Dr. Hodge, e.g., does not rise above the Zwinglian view. He
   denies that Christ is present in any other way than spiritually, and
   that believers receive any other benefit than 'the sacrificial virtue
   and effects of the death of Christ on the cross,' which he maintains
   was received already by the saints of the Old Testament and the
   disciples at the first Supper, before the glorified body of Christ had
   any existence. 'The efficacy of this sacrament, as a means of grace, is
   not in the signs, nor in the service, nor in the minister, nor in the
   word, but in the attending influence of the Holy Spirit.'--System.
   Theol. Vol. III. pp. 646, 647, 650.

   [737] Dorner (in his History of German Theology, p. 287) says that
   Zwingli retained from his humanistic culture a certain disposition to
   'an aesthetic consideration of sin,' i.e., to see in it something
   disgraceful, unworthy, bestial rather than diabolical.

   [738] Defectus naturalis, or, as he often calls it in his Swiss-German,
   a Brest, i.e. Gebrechen. 'Die Erbsünd,' he says in his book on
   Baptism,' ist nüts (nichts) anders weder (als) der Brest von Adam her.
   . . . Wir verstond (verstehen) durch das Wort Brest einen Mangel, den
   einer ohn sin Schuld von der Geburt her hat oder sust (sonst) von
   Zufällen.' He distinguishes it from Laster and Frevel, vice and crime.
   He explains his view more fully in his tract De peccato originali ad
   Urbanum Regium, 1526, and also in his Confession to Charles V., 1530.

   [739] 'Peccatum originale non proprie peccatum est, non enim est
   facinus contra legem. Morbus igitur est proprie et conditio.' Fidei
   Ratio ad Carol. V. Cap. IV. (Niemeyer, p. 20).

   [740] Fidei Ratio, Cap. V. (Niemeyer, p. 21): 'Hinc constat, si in
   Christo secundo Adam vitæ restituimur, quemadmodum in primo Adam sumus
   morti traditi, quod temere damnamus Christianis parentibus natos
   pueros, imo gentium quoque pueros. Adam enim si perderere universum
   genus peccando potuit, et Christus moriendo non vivificavit et redemit
   universum genus a clade per istum data, jam non est par salus reddita
   per Christum, et perinde (quod absit!) nec verum, "Sicut in Adam omnes
   moriuntur, ita in Christo omnes vitæ restituuntur." Verum quomodocunque
   de gentilium infantibus statuendum sit, hoc certe adseveramus, propter
   virtutem salutis per Christum præstitæ, præter rem pronunciare qui eos
   æternæ maledictioni addicunt, cum propter dictam reparationis causam,
   tum propter electionem Dei liberam, quæ non sequitur fidem, sed fides
   electionem sequitur.' In another passage against the Catabaptists he
   says: 'Electi eligebantur antequam in utero conciperentur: mox igitur
   ut sunt, filii Dei sunt, etiamsi moriantur antequam credant aut ad
   fidem vocentur. Comp. Zeller, 1.c. p. 162.

   [741] The limbus infantum is, so to speak, the nursery of hell, on the
   top floor and away from the fire, as Bellarmin says, in loco inferni
   altiori, ita ut ad eum ignis non perveniat. In a still higher region
   was the limbus patrum, the temporary abode of the saints of the Old
   Testament, but this was vacated at the descent of Christ into Hades,
   when those saints were freed from prison and translated into Paradise.

   [742] 'Parvulos non baptizatos in damnatione omnium lenissima futuros'
   (Contra Jul. lib. V. c. 11); 'Infantes non baptizati lenissime quidem,
   sed tamen damnantur. Potest proinde recte dici, parvulos sine baptismo
   de corpore exeuntes in damnatione omnium mitissima futuros' (De pecc.
   mer. et rem. cap. 16). Pelagius was more liberal, and assumed a middle
   state of half-blessedness for unbaptized infants between the heaven of
   the baptized and the hell of the ungodly. See particulars in my Church
   History, Vol. III. pp. 835 sqq.

   [743] Conf. August. Art. IX.: 'Damnant Anabaptistas qui . . . affirmant
   pueros sine baptismo salvos fieri.' In the German edition the last
   clause is omitted.

   [744] Calovius (in the consensus repetitus fidei vere Lutheranæ, 1655),
   in the name of the strict Lutherans, rejected the milder view of a
   merely privative punishment of unbaptized infants, as held by Calixtus
   (see Henke, Georg Calixtus, Vol. II. Pt. II. p. 295), but it was
   defended by others. Fr. Buddæus, one of the most liberal among the
   orthodox Lutherans, describes the condition of heathen infants as
   admodum tolerabilis, though they are exclusi a beatitudine (Instit.
   Theol. dogm. Lips. 1723, p. 631). Others leave the children to the
   mercy of God. See V. E. Löscher's Auserlesene Sammlung der besten
   neueren Schriften vom Zustand der Seele nach dem Tode, 1735;
   republished by Hubert Becker, 1835.

   [745] Westminster Conf. chap. x. § 3: 'Elect infants, dying in infancy,
   are regenerated and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh
   when and where and how he pleaseth. So also are all other elect persons
   who are incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the
   word.' The last sentence may be fairly interpreted as teaching the
   election and salvation of a portion of heathen adults.

   [746] 'Abhorremus et detestamur . . . crudele judicium contra infantes
   sine baptismo morientes, bapitismi absolutam quant asserit
   necessitatem.' Niemeyer, pp. 357, 358.

   [747] Dr. Hodge, the most orthodox Calvinistic divine of the age, very
   positively teaches (Syst. Theol. Vol. I. p. 26) the salvation of all
   infants dying in infancy, and represents this as the 'common doctrine
   of evangelical Protestants.' This may be true of the present
   generation, and we hope it is, though it is evidently inapplicable to
   the period of scholastic orthodoxy, both Lutheran and Calvinistic. He
   supports his view by three arguments: 1. The analogy between Adam and
   Christ (Rom. v. 18, 19, where we have no right to restrict the free
   gift of Christ upon all more than the Bible itself restricts it); 2.
   Christ's conduct towards children; 3. The general nature of God to
   bless and to save, rather than to curse and destroy.

   [748] His last and fullest utterance on this subject occurs towards the
   close of his Expositio Chr. Fidei, where, speaking of eternal life, he
   thus addresses the French king: 'Deinde sperandum est tibi visurum esse
   sanctorum, prudentium, fidelium, canstantium, fortium, virtuosorum
   omnium, quicunque a condito mundo fuerunt, sodalitatem, coetum et
   contubernium. Hic duos Adam, redemptum ac Redemptorem: hic Abelum,
   Enochum, Noam, Abrahamum, Isaacum, Jacobum, Judam, Mosen, Josuam,
   Gedeonem, Samuelem, Pinhen, Heliam, Heliseum, Isaiam, ac deiparam
   Virginem de qua ille præcinuit, Davidem, Ezekiam, Josiam, Baptistam,
   Petrum, Paulum: hic Herculem, Theseum, Socratem, Aristidem, Antigonum,
   Numam, Camillum, Catones, Scipiones: hic Ludovichum pium
   antecessoresque tuos Ludovicos, Philippos, Pipinnos, et quotquot in
   fide hinc migrarunt maiores tuos videbis. Et summatim, non fuit vir
   bonus, non erit mens sancta, non est fidelis anima, ab ipso mundi
   exordia usque ad eius consummationem, quem non sis isthic cum Deo
   visurus. Quo spectaculo quid lætius, quid amænius, quid denique
   honorificentius vel cogitari potent? Aut quo iustius omnes animi vires
   intendimus quam ad huiuscemodi vitæ lucrum?' See Niemeyer, p. 61.
   Similar passages occur in his Epistles, Commentaries, and tract on
   Providence. Comp. Zeller, p. 163.

   [749] 'Hoc si verum est, totum evangelium falsum est.' Luther denied
   the possibility of salvation outside of the Christian Church. In his
   Catech. Major, Pars II. Art. III. (ed. Rechenb. p. 503, ed. Müller, p.
   460), he says: 'Quicunque extra Christianitatem (ausser der
   Christenheit) sunt, sive Gentiles sive Turcæ sive Judæi aut falsi etiam
   Christiani et hypocritæ, quanquam unum tantum et verum Deum esse
   credant et invocent (ob sie gleich nur Einen wahrhaftigen Gott gläuben
   und anbeten), neque tamen certum habent, quo erga eos animatus sit
   animo, neque quidquam favoris aut gratiæ de Deo sibi polliceri audent
   et possunt, quamobrem in perpetua manent ira et damnatione (darum sie
   im ewigen Zorn und Verdammniss bleiben).'

   [750] Dr. Dorner, with his usual fairness and fine discrimination,
   vindicates Zwingli against misrepresentations (Gesch. d. Prot. Theol.
   p. 284): 'Man hat daraus eine Gleichgültigkeit gegen den historischen
   Christus und sein Werk erschliessen wollen, dass er [Zwingli] auch von
   Heiden sagt: sie seien selig geworden; was die Heiden Weisheit nennen,
   das nennen die Christen Glauben. Allein er sieht in allem Wahren vor
   Christo mit manchen Kirchenvätern eine Wirkung und Offenbarung des
   Logos, ohne jedoch so weit zu gehen, mit Justin die Weisen des
   Alterthums, welche nach dem Logos gelebt haben, Christen zu nennen. Er
   sagt nur, sie seien nach dem Tode selig geworden, ähnlich wie auch die
   Kirche dasselbe von den Vätern des Alten Testaments annimmt. Er konnte
   dabei wohl diese Seligkeit als durch Christus gewirkt und erworben
   denken und hat dieselbe jedenfalls nur als in der Gemeinschaft mit
   Christus bestehend gedacht. Ist ihm doch durch den ewigen Rathschluss
   der Versöhnung Christus nicht bloss ewig gewiss, sondern auch
   gegenwärtig für alle Zeiten. So sind ihm jene Heiden doch selig nur
   durch Christus. Freilich das sagt er nicht, dass sie erst im Jenseits
   sich bekehren; auch erschneidet mit dem Diesseits die Bekehrung ab. Er
   lässt ihre im Diesseits bewährte Treue gegen das ihnen vom Logos
   anvertraute Pfund wahrer Erkentniss die Stelle des Glaubens vertreten.
   Aber es ist wohl kein Zweifel, dass er sie im Jenseits zur Erkentniss
   und Gemeinschaft Christi gelangend denkt. Bei den Frommen Alten
   Testaments fordert auch die Kirche zu ihrem Heil nicht eine bestimmtere
   Erkenntniss Christi im Diesseits, die sie höchstens den Propheten'
   zuschreiben könnte.' Ebrard (in his History of the Dogma of the Lord's
   Supper. Vol. II. p. 77) fully adopts Zwingli's view: 'Jetzt wird ihm
   wohl Niemand mehr daraus ein Verbrechen machen. Wir wissen, dass Röm.
   ii. 7: "Denen, die in Beharrlickkeit des Gutesthuns nach
   unvergänglichem Wesen trachten," ewiges Leben verheissen ist, wir
   wissen dass nur der positive Unglaube an das angebotene Heil weder hier
   noch dort vergeben wird, dass nur auf ihn die Strafe des ewigen Todes
   gesetzt ist; wir wissen, dass auf die erste Auferstehung der in Christo
   Entschlafenen noch eine zweite der ganzen übrigen Menschheit folgen
   soll, die alsdann gerichtet werden sollen nach ihren Werken, und dass
   im neuen Jerusalem selber die Blätter des Lebensbaumes dienen sollen
   zur Genesung der Heiden (Apok. xxii. 2). Zwingli hat also an der Hand
   der heiligen Schrift das Heidenthum ebenso wie das Judenthum als an den
   stoicheiois tou kosmou gehörig (Gal. iv. 1-3) angesehen, und mit vollem
   Rechte einen Socrates neben einen Abraham gestellt. Ihm besteht die
   Seligkeit darin, dass das ganze Wunderwerk der göttlichen Weltpädagogik
   in seinen Früchten klar und herrlich vor den Blicken der erstaunten
   Seligen da liegt.'

   [751] John Eliot, the 'Apostle of the Indians,' labored among the
   Indians in that polemical age. He died 1690, eighty-six years of age,
   at Roxbury, Massachusetts. David Brainerd (d. at Northampton, Mass.,
   1747) likewise labored among the Indians before any missionary zeal was
   kindled in the Protestant churches of Europe.

   The two Confessions of Basle are published in German and Latin by
   Niemeyer, Coll. pp. 78-122: in German alone by Beck and Böckel in their
   collections. The best reprint of the First Confession of Basle, in the
   Swiss dialect, with the Scripture proofs on the margin, is given by
   Hagenbach at the close of his biography of OEkolampad und Myconius, pp.
   465-470.


   The First and Second Confessions of Basle belong to the Zwinglian
   family, and preceded the age of Calvin, but are a little nearer the
   German Lutheran type of Protestantism.

   The rich and venerable city of Basle, on the frontier of Switzerland,
   France, and South Germany, since 1501 a member of the Swiss
   Confederacy, renowned for the reformatory OEcumenical Council of 1430,
   and the University founded by Pius II., became a centre of liberal
   learning before the Reformation. Thomas Wyttenbach, the teacher of
   Zwingli, attacked the indulgences as early as 1502. In 1516 Erasmus of
   Rotterdam, at that time esteemed as the greatest scholar of Europe,
   took up his permanent residence in Basle, and published the first
   edition of the Greek Testament and other important works, though, after
   the peasant war and Luther's violent attack on him, he became disgusted
   with the Reformation, which he did not understand. He desired merely a
   quiet literary illumination within the Catholic Church, and formed a
   bridge between two ages. He died, like Moses, in the land of Moab
   (1536). [753] Wolfgang Capito (Köpfli), an Alsacian, labored in Basle
   as preacher and professor from 1512 to 1520, in friendly intercourse
   with Erasmus, and was followed by Caspar Hedio (Heid), who continued in
   the same spirit, and corresponded with Luther. Another preacher in
   Basle, Wilhelm Röublin, carried on the Corpus Christi festival a large
   Bible through the city, with the inscription, 'This is the true
   sanctuary; the rest are dead men's bones.'

   The principal Reformer of Basle is John OEcolampadius (Hausschein, b.
   1482, d. 1531), who stood to Zwingli in a similar relation as
   Melanchthon to Luther: inferior to him in originality, boldness, and
   energy, but superior in learning, modesty, and gentleness of spirit. He
   was his chief support in the defense of his doctrine on the eucharist,
   and took a prominent part in the Conference with Luther at Marburg.
   Born at Weinsberg, he studied philology, scholastic philosophy, law,
   and theology with unusual success at Heilbronn, Bologna, Heidelberg,
   and Tübingen. When twelve years old he wrote Latin poems, and at
   fourteen he graduated as bachelor of arts. He excelled especially as a
   Greek and Hebrew scholar, and published afterwards learned commentaries
   on the prophets and other books of the Bible. He aided Erasmus in the
   edition of his Greek Testament, 1516. He was well-read in the fathers,
   and promoted a critical study of their writings. After having labored
   as preacher for some time in different places, and taken some part in
   the reformatory movements of Germany, he settled permanently at Basle,
   in 1522, as pastor of St. Martin and as professor of theology. Here he
   introduced, with the consent of the citizens, the German service, the
   communion under both kinds, and other changes. But it was only after
   the transition of Berne that Basle came out decidedly for the
   Reformation. It was formally introduced Feb. 9, 1529, according to the
   model of Zurich, but in a rather violent style, by the breaking of
   images and the dissolution of convents, yet without shedding of blood.
   In other respects the Reformed Church of Basle is conservative, and
   occupies a middle position between Zwinglianisrn and Lutheranism.
   OEcolampadius died Nov. 24, 1531, a few weeks after his friend Zwingli.
   He communed with his family, and took an affecting farewell of his
   wife, his three children (Eusebius, Irene, and Aletheia), and the
   ministers of Basle. His last words were: 'Shortly I shall be with the
   Lord Christ. . . . Lord Jesus save me!' [754]

   The First Confession of Basle (Confessio Fidei Basileensis prior) was
   prepared in its first draft by OEcolampadius, 1531, [755] brought into
   its present shape by his successor, Oswald Myconius, [756] 1532, and
   first published by the magistrate with a preface of Adelberg Meyer,
   burgomaster of Basle, Jan. 21, 1534. [757] Two or three years
   afterwards it was adopted and issued by the confederated city of
   Mühlhausen, in the Alsace; hence it is also called the Confessio
   Mühlhusana (or Mylhusiana).

   It is very simple and moderate. It briefly expresses, in twelve
   articles, the orthodox evangelical doctrines of God, the fall of man,
   the divine providence, the person of Christ, the Church and the
   sacraments, the Lord's Supper (Christ the food of the soul to
   everlasting life), Church discipline, the civil magistrate, faith and
   works, the judgment, ceremonies and celibacy, and against the views of
   the Anabaptists, who were then generally regarded as dangerous
   radicals, not only by Luther, but also by the Swiss and English
   Reformers. This is the only Reformed Confession which does not begin
   with the assertion of the Bible principle, but it concludes with this
   noteworthy sentence: '"We submit this our Confession to the judgment of
   the divine Scriptures, and hold ourselves ready always thankfully to
   obey God and his Word if we should be corrected out of said holy
   Scriptures.' [758]

   'This Confession,' says the late Professor Hagenbach of Basle, [759]
   'has remained the public Confession of the Church of Basle to this day.
   It is, indeed, no longer annually read before the congregation as
   formerly (on Maundy-Thursday at the ante-communion service), but
   ministers at their ordination are still required to promise "to teach
   according to the direction of God's Word and the Basle Confession
   derived therefrom." A motion was made in the city government in 1826 to
   change it, but the Church Council declared such change inexpedient.
   Another motion in 1859 to abolish it altogether was set aside. But the
   political significance of the Confession can no longer be sustained, in
   view of the change of public sentiment in regard to the liberty of
   faith and conscience.'

   [753] Erasmus turned his keen wit first against the obscurantism of the
   monks, but afterwards against the light of the Reformation. He said to
   Frederick the Wise at Cologne, before the Diet of Worms (within the
   hearing of Spalatin): 'Lutherus peccavit in duobus, nempe quod tetigit
   coronam pontificis et ventres monachorum.' But when Luther, Zwingli,
   OEcolampadius took wives, he called the Reformation a comedy which
   ended always in a marriage.

   [754] See the particulars in Herzog's OEkolamp. Vol. II. pp. 248 sqq.
   He was buried with all the honors of the city in the Minster. But the
   mouth of slander spread the lie that he had committed suicide, to which
   even Luther, blinded by dogmatic prejudice, was not ashamed to give
   ear. Melanchthon had great respect for OEcolampadius, stood in friendly
   correspondence with him, and derived from him a better knowledge of the
   patristic doctrine of the eucharist.

   [755] See Herzog, 1.c. Vol. II. pp. 217-221, and Hagenbach, Joh. OEkol.
   und Oswald Mycon. pp. 350 sqq. OEcolampadius, in his last address to
   the Synod of Basle, Sept. 26, 1531, added a brief, terse confession of
   faith, and a paraphrase of the Apostles' Creed. But the assertion that
   he composed the Confession of Basle in its present shape, and sent it
   to the Augsburg Diet, 1530, rests on a mistake, and has no foundation
   in any contemporary report.

   [756] His proper name was Geisshüssler. He was born at Luzerne, 1488;
   taught and preached at Zurich; after Zwingli's death he moved to Basle,
   was elected Antistes or first preacher, died 1552, and was buried in
   the Minster. He must not be confounded with Friedrich Myconius, or
   Mecum, the Lutheran reformer of Thuringia, and court chaplain at Gotha
   (d. 1546).

   [757] Under the title, 'Bekanntnuss unseres heiligen Christlichen
   Glaubens wie es die Kylch (Kirche) zu Basel halt.' It is signed by
   'Heinrich Rhyner, Rathschreiber der Statt Basel.' See the German text,
   with the marginal notes, at the close of Hagenbach's biography of
   OEcolampadius and Myconius. A Latin edition appeared 1561 and 1581,
   which was reproduced in the Corpus et Syntagma Confess., under the
   title 'Basiliensis vel Mylhusiana Confessio Fidei. anno M.D.XXXII.
   Scripta Germanice. Latine excusa 1561 et 1581.' Here the date of
   composition (1532) is given instead of the date of publication (1534).
   The more usual spelling is Basileensis and Mühlhusana. A better Latin
   edition was issued, 1647, by the Basle Professors--Theod. Zwinger,
   Sebastian Beck, and John Buxtorf--for the use of academic disputations;
   and this Niemeyer has reprinted, pp. 85 sqq.

   [758] 'Postremo, hanc nostrum Confessionem judicio Sacræ Biblicæ

   See Literature in § 53. Comp. also Pestalozzi: Heinrich Bullinger, pp.
   183 sqq.

   The First Helvetic Confession (Confessio Helvetica prior), so called to
   distinguish it from the Second Helvetic Confession of 1566, is the same
   with the Second Confession of Basle (Basileensis posterior), in
   distinction from the First of 1534. [760] It owes its origin partly to
   the renewed efforts of the Strasburg Reformers, Bucer and Capito, to
   bring about a union between the Lutherans and the Swiss, and partly to
   the papal promise of convening a General Council. A number of Swiss
   divines were delegated by the magistrates of Zurich, Berne, Basle,
   Schaffhausen, St. Gall, Mühlhausen, and Biel, to a Conference in the
   Augustinian convent at Basle, January 30, 1536. Bucer and Capito also
   appeared. Bullinger, Myconius, Grynæus, Leo Judæ, and Megander were
   selected to draw up a Confession of the faith of the Helvetic Churches,
   which might be used before the proposed General Council. It was
   examined and signed by all the clerical and lay delegates, February,
   1536, and first published in Latin. [761] Leo Judæ prepared the German
   translation, which is fuller than the Latin text, and of equal
   authority.

   Luther, to whom a copy was sent through Bucer, expressed unexpectedly,
   in two remarkable letters, his satisfaction with the earnest Christian
   character of this document, and promised to do all he could to promote
   union and harmony with the Swiss. [762] He was then under the hopeful
   impressions of the 'Wittenberg Concordia,' which Bucer had brought
   about by his elastic diplomacy, May, 1536, but which proved after all a
   hollow peace, and could not be honestly signed by the Swiss.

   The Helvetic Confession is the first Reformed Creed of national
   authority. It consists of twenty-seven articles, is fuller than the
   first Confession of Basle, but not so full as the second Helvetic
   Confession, by which it was afterwards superseded. The doctrine of the
   sacraments and of the Lord's Supper is essentially Zwinglian, yet
   emphasizes the significance of the sacramental signs and the real
   spiritual presence of Christ, who gives his body and blood--that is,
   himself--to believers, so that he more and more lives in them and they
   in him.

   It seems that Bullinger and Leo Judæ wished to add a caution against
   the binding authority of this or any other confession that might
   interfere with the supreme authority of the Word of God and with
   Christian liberty. [763]

   [760] Hagenbach, l.c. p. 357: 'Basler Confession heisst diese
   Confession nur weil sie in, nicht weil sie für Basel verfasst ist
   (ähnlich wie die Augsburger Confession von dem Ort der Uebergabe den
   Namen hat). Bezeichnender ist daher der Name erste Helvetische
   Confession, weil sie das Gesammtbekenntniss der reformirten
   Schweizerkirchen ist.'

   Schaffhausen, Mühlhausen, Biel, etc., 1536, Februariy.'

   [762] See his letter to Jacob Meyer, burgomaster of Basle, Feb. 17,
   1535, and his response to the Reformed Cantons, Dec. 1, 1537 (in De
   Wette, Vol. V. pp. 54 and 83). Luther kept the peace with the Swiss
   churches only for a few years. In his book against the Turks, 1541, he
   calumniated without provocation the memory of Zwingli; in August, 1543,
   he acknowledged the present of the Zurich translation of the Bible sent
   to him by Froschauer, the publisher, but scornfully declined to accept
   any further works from preachers 'with whom neither he nor the Church
   of God could have any communion, and who were driving people to hell'
   (see his letter in De Wette, Vol. V. p. 587); in 1544 he violently
   renewed, to the great grief of Melanchthon, the sacramental war in his
   'Short Confession of the Sacrament;' and shortly before his death he
   was not ashamed to travesty the first Psalm thus: 'Beatus vir, qui non
   abiit in consilio Sacramentariorum: nec stetit in via Cinglianorum, nec
   sedet in cathedra Tigurinorum.' (See his letter to Jac. Probst of
   Bremen, Jan. 17, 1546, in De Wette, Vol. V. p. 778. Comp. also on this
   whole subject Hagenbach, l.c. p. 358, and Pestalozzi, l.c. pp. 216
   sqq.). Myconius was not disturbed by these outbursts of passion, and
   continued to respect Luther without departing from the doctrine of his
   friend Zwingli. He judged, not without some reason, that the two
   Reformers never understood each other; that Luther stubbornly believed
   that Zwingli taught the sacrament to be an empty sign, and Zwingli that
   Luther taught a gross Capernaitic eating. See his letter of Sept. 7,
   1538, to Bibliander, in Simmler's Collection, Vol. XLV., and Hagenbach,
   p. 350.

   [763] This addition, which is not found in any copy, is thus stated by
   Hagenbach and Niemeyer (Proleg. p. xxxvi.): 'Durch diese Artikel wollen
   wir keineswegs allen Kirchen eine einzige Glaubensregel vorschreiben.
   Denn wir erkennen keine andere Glaubensregel an als die heilige
   Schrift. Wer also mit dieser übereinstimmt, mit dem sind wir
   einstimmig, obgleich er anders von unserer Confession verschiedene
   Redensarten brauchte. Denn auf die Sache selbst und die Wahrheit, nicht
   auf die Worte soll man sehen. Wir stellen also jedem frei, diejeniqen
   Redensarten zu gebrauchen, welche er für seine Kirche am passendsten
   glaubt, und werden uns auch dergleichen Freiheit bedienen, gegen
   Verdrehung des wahren Sinnes dieser Confession uns aber zu vertheidigen
   wissen. Dieser Ansdrücke haben wir uns jetzt bedient, um unsere
   Ueberzeugung darzustellen.' Pestalozzi. p. 186, gives the same
   declaration more fully.

   Before we proceed to the Calvinistic Confessions, we anticipate the
   Second Helvetic Confession, the last and the best of the Zwinglian
   family.

   BULLINGER.

   It is the work of Henry Bullinger (1504-1575), the pupil, friend, and
   successor of Zwingli, to whom he stands related as Beza does to Calvin.
   He was a learned, pious, wise, and faithful man, and the central figure
   in the second period of the Reformation in German Switzerland. Born at
   Bremgarten, in Aargau, [764] educated in Holland and Cologne, where he
   studied patristic and scholastic theology, and read with great interest
   the writings of Luther and the Loci of Melanchthon, he became on his
   return intimately acquainted with Zwingli, accompanied him to the
   Conference at Berne (1528), and after laboring for some years at Cappel
   and Bremgarten, he was chosen his successor as chief pastor (Antistes)
   at Zurich, Dec. 9, 1531. This was shortly after the catastrophe at
   Cappel, in the darkest period of the Swiss Reformation.

   Bullinger proved to be the right man in the right place. He raised the
   desponding spirits, preserved and completed the work of his
   predecessor, and exerted, by his example and writings, a commanding
   influence throughout the Reformed Church inferior only to that of
   Calvin. He was in friendly correspondence with Calvin, Bucer,
   Melanchthon, Laski, Beza, Cranmer, Hooper, [765] Lady Jane Grey, [766]
   and the leading Protestant divines and dignitaries of England. Some of
   them had found an hospitable refuge in his house and with his friends
   during the bloody reign of Mary (1553-58), and after their return, when
   raised to bishoprics and other positions of influence under Queen
   Elizabeth, they asked his counsel, and kept him informed about the
   progress of reform in their country. This correspondence is an
   interesting testimony not only to his personal worth, but also to the
   fraternal communion which then existed between the Anglican and the
   Swiss Reformed Churches. [767] Episcopacy was then not yet deemed the
   only valid form of the Christian ministry. He opened his house also to
   Italian Protestants, and treated even the elder Sozino, who died at
   Zurich, with great kindness and liberality, endeavoring to restrain his
   heretical tendency. In the latter years of his life he was severely
   tried by the death of his best friends (Bibliander, Froschauer, Peter
   Martyr, Pellican, Gessner, Blaarer, Calvin, Hyperius), and by a fearful
   pestilence which deprived him of his beloved wife and three daughters,
   and brought him to the brink of the grave. He bore all with Christian
   resignation, recovered from disease, and continued faithfully to labor
   for several years longer, until he was called to his reward, after
   taking affectionate farewell of all the pastors and professors of
   Zurich, thanking them for their devotion, assuring them of his love,
   and giving each one of them the hand with his blessing. He assumed the
   care of the Church of Zurich when it was in a dangerous crisis; he left
   it firmly and safely established.

   COMPOSITION.

   Bullinger was one of the principal authors of the First Helvetic
   Confession, and the sole author of the Second. In the intervening
   thirty years Calvin had developed his amazing energy, while Romanism
   had formularized its dogmas in the Council of Trent.

   Bullinger composed the Second Helvetic Confession in 1562, in latin,
   for his own use, as an abiding testimony of the faith in which he had
   lived and in which he wished to die. He showed it to Peter Martyr, who
   fully consented to it, shortly before his death (Nov. 12, 1562). Two
   years afterwards lie elaborated it more fully during the raging of the
   pestilence, and added it to his will, which was to be delivered to the
   magistrate of Zurich after his death, which he then expected every day.
   [768]

   PUBLICATION.

   But events in Germany gave it a public character. The pious Elector of
   the Palatinate, Frederick III., being threatened by the Lutherans with
   exclusion from the treaty of peace on account of his secession to the
   Reformed Church and publication of the Heidelberg Catechism (1563),
   requested Bullinger (1565) to prepare a clear and full exposition of
   the Reformed faith, that he might answer the charges of heresy and
   dissension so constantly brought against the same. Bullinger sent him a
   manuscript copy of his Confession. The Elector was so much pleased with
   it that he desired to have it translated and published in Latin and
   German before the meeting of the Imperial Diet, which was to assemble
   at Augsburg in 1566, to act on his alleged apostasy.

   In the mean time the Swiss felt the need of such a Confession as a
   closer bond of union. The First Helvetic Confession was deemed too
   short, and the Zurich Confession of 1545, the Zurich Consensus of 1549,
   and the Geneva Consensus of 1552 touched only the articles of the
   Lord's Supper and predestination. Conferences were held, and Beza came
   in person to Zurich to take part in the work. Bullinger freely
   consented to a few changes, and prepared also the German version.
   Geneva, Berne, Schaffhausen, Biel, the Grisons, St. Gall, and
   Muhlhausen expressed their agreement. Basle alone, which had its own
   Confession, declined for a long time, but ultimately acceded.

   The new Confession appeared at Zurich, March 12, 1566, in both
   languages, at public expense, and was forwarded to the Elector and to
   Philip of Hesse. [769] A French translation appeared soon afterwards in
   Geneva under the care of Beza.

   In the same month the Elector Frederick made such a manly and noble
   defense of his faith before the Diet at Augsburg, that even his
   Lutheran opponents were filled with admiration for his piety, and
   thought no longer of impeaching him for heresy.

   AUTHORITY.

   The Helvetic Confession is the most widely adopted, and hence the most
   authoritative of all the Continental Reformed symbols, with the
   exception of the Heidelberg Catechism. Besides the Swiss Cantons and
   the Palatinate, in whose name it was first issued, the Reformed
   Churches of Neufchatel (1568), Basle, France (at the Synod of La
   Rochelle, 1571), Hungary (at the Synod of Debreczin, 1567), Poland
   (1571 and 1578), and Scotland (1566) [770] gave it their sanction. It
   was well received also in Holland and England. [771]

   It was translated not only into German, French, and English, but also
   into Dutch, Magyar, Polish, Italian, Arabic, and Turkish. [772]

   CHARACTER AND VALUE.

   Like most of the Confessions of the sixteenth century, the Helvetic
   Confession is expanded beyond the limits of a popular creed into a
   lengthy theological treatise. It is the matured fruit of the preceding
   symbolical labors of Bullinger and the Swiss Churches. It is in
   substance a restatement of the First Helvetic Confession, in the same
   order of topics, but with great improvements in matter and form. It is
   scriptural and catholic, wise and judicious, full and elaborate, yet
   simple and clear, uncompromising towards the errors of Rome, moderate
   in its dissent from the Lutheran dogmas. It proceeds on the conviction
   that the Reformed faith is in harmony with the true Catholic faith of
   all ages, especially the ancient Greek and Latin Church.

   Hence it is preceded by the Imperial edict of 380 (from the recognized
   Justinian code), which draws the line between orthodoxy and heresy, and
   excludes as heresies only the departures from the Apostolic and Nicene
   faith. It inserts also the brief Trinitarian creed ascribed to the
   Roman Pope Damasus (from the writings of Jerome), and referred to in
   said decree as a standard of orthodoxy. [773] Harmony in the
   fundamental doctrines of the ancient Church is declared sufficient, and
   brotherly union consistent with variety in unessentials, such as in
   fact always has existed in the Christian Church. As in former
   Confessions, so also in this, Bullinger distinctly recognizes, in the
   spirit of Christian liberty and progress, the constant growth in the
   knowledge of the Word of God, and the consequent right of improvement
   in symbolical statements of the Christian faith.

   Upon the whole, the Second Helvetic Confession, as to theological
   merit, occupies the first rank among the Reformed Confessions, while in
   practical usefulness it is surpassed by the Heidelberg and Westminster
   Shorter Catechisms, and in logical clearness and precision by the
   Westminster Confession, which is the product of a later age, and of the
   combined learning and wisdom of English and Scotch Calvinism. [774]

   CONTENTS.

   In view of the importance of this Confession, I give here a condensed
   translation of the original. [775] It consists of thirty chapters,
   which cover in natural order all the articles of faith and discipline
   which then challenged the attention of the Church.

   Chap. I. The Holy Scriptures.--This chapter lays down the evangelical
   rule of faith, or the objective principle of Protestantism.

   We believe and confess that the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New
   Testaments are the true Word of God, and have sufficient authority in
   and of themselves, and not from men; since God himself through them
   still speaks to us, as he did to the Fathers, the Prophets, and
   Apostles. They contain all that is necessary to a saving faith and a
   holy life; and hence nothing should be added to or taken from them
   (Deut. iv. 2; Rev. xxii. 18, 19).

   From the Scriptures must be derived all true wisdom and piety, and also
   the reformation and government of the Churches, the proof of doctrines,
   and the refutation of errors (2 Tim. iii. 16, 17; 1 Tim. iii. 15; 1
   Thess. ii. 13; Matt. x. 20). God may illuminate men directly by the
   Holy Spirit, without the external ministry; yet he has chosen the
   Scriptures and the preaching of the Word as the usual method of
   instruction.

   The apocryphal books of the Old Testament, though they may be read for
   edification, are not to be used as an authority in matters of faith.
   [776]

   We condemn the doctrines of the Gnostics and Manichæans, and all others
   who reject the Scriptures in whole or in part.

   Chap. II. The Interpretation of the Scriptures; the Fathers, Councils,
   and Traditions.--We acknowledge only that interpretation as true and
   correct which is fairly derived from the spirit and language of the
   Scriptures themselves, in accordance with the circumstances, and in
   harmony with other and plainer passages (2 Pet. i. 20, 21).

   We do not despise the interpretation of the Greek and Latin fathers and
   the teaching of Councils, but subordinate them to the Scriptures;
   honoring them as far as they agree with the Scriptures, and modestly
   dissenting from them when they go beyond or against the Scriptures. In
   matters of faith we can not admit any other judge than God himself, who
   through his Word tells us what is true and what is false, what is to be
   followed, and what is to be avoided.

   We reject traditions which contradict the Scriptures, though they may
   claim to be apostolical. For the Apostles and their disciples could not
   teach one thing by writing, and another by word of mouth. St. Paul
   preached the same doctrine to all the churches (1 Cor. iv. 17; 2 Cor.
   i. 13; xii. 18). The Jews likewise had their traditions of the elders,
   but they were refuted by our Lord as 'making void the Word of God'
   (Matt. xv. 8, 9; Mark vii. 6, 7).

   Chap III. Of God, his Unity and Trinity.--We believe and teach that God
   is one in essence (Deut. vi. 4; Exod. xx. 2, 3, etc.), and three in
   persons--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The Father hath begotten the Son
   from eternity; the Son is begotten in an unspeakable manner; the Holy
   Ghost eternally proceeds from both, and is to be worshiped with both as
   one God. There are not three Gods, but three persons--consubstantial,
   coeternal, distinct as to person and order, yet without any inequality.
   The divine essence or nature is the same in the Father, the Son, and
   the Spirit (Luke i. 35; Matt. iii. 17; xxviii. 19; John i. 32; xiv. 26;
   xv. 26).

   In short, we accept the Apostles' Creed, which delivers to us the true
   faith.

   We therefore condemn the Jews and Mohammedans, and all who blaspheme
   this holy and adorable Trinity. We also condemn all heretics, who deny
   the Deity of Christ and the Holy Ghost.

   Chap. IV Of Idols, Images of Gods and of Saints.--As God is a spirit,
   he can not be represented by any image (John iv. 24; Isa. xl. 18; xliv.
   9, 10; Jer. xvi. 19; Acts xvii. 29, etc.).

   And although Christ assumed man's nature, yet he did so not in order to
   afford a model for sculptors and painters. He instituted for the
   instruction of the people the preaching of the Gospel, and the
   sacraments, but not images. Epiphanius tore down an image of Christ and
   some saint in a church, because he regarded it contrary to the
   Scriptures.

   Chap. V. The Adoration and Invocation of God through the only Mediator
   Jesus Christ.--God is the only object of worship (Matt. iv. 10). And he
   is to be worshiped 'in spirit and in truth' (John iv. 24), and through
   our only and sufficient Mediator and Advocate Jesus Christ (1 Tim. ii.
   5; 1 John ii. 1).

   Hence we neither adore nor invoke the departed saints, and give no one
   else the glory that belongs to God alone (Isa. xlii. 8; Acts iv, 12).

   Nevertheless, we neither despise nor undervalue the saints, but honor
   them as the members of Christ and the friends of God, who have
   gloriously overcome the flesh and the world; we love them as brethren,
   and hold them up as examples of faith and virtue, desiring to dwell
   with them eternally in heaven, and to rejoice with them in Christ.

   Much less do we believe that the relics of saints should be worshiped.
   Nor do we swear by saints, since it is forbidden to swear by the name
   of strange gods (Exod. xxiii. 13; Deut. x. 20).

   Chap. VI. The Providence of God.--We believe that the wise, eternal,
   and almighty God by his providence preserves and rules all things in
   heaven and earth (Psa. cxiii. 4-6; cxxxix. 3-4; Acts xvii. 28; Rom. xi.
   36).

   We therefore condemn the Epicureans, who blasphemously affirm that God
   neither sees nor cares for men (Psa. xciv. 3-9).

   We do not despise as unnecessary the means whereby divine Providence
   works, but make use of them as far as they are commended to us in the
   Word of God. We disapprove of the rash words of those who say that our
   efforts and endeavors are vain.

   St. Paul well knew that he was sailing under the providence of God, who
   had assured him that he must bear witness at Rome (Acts xxiii. 11), and
   that not a soul should perish (xxvii. 21, 34); nevertheless, when the
   sailors were seeking flight, he said to the centurion and the soldiers:
   'Unless these abide in the ship, ye can not be saved' (ver. 31). For
   God has appointed the means by which we attain to the end. [777]

   Chap. VII. Of the Creation of all Things; of Angels, the Devil, and
   Man.--This good and almighty God created all things, visible and
   invisible, by his eternal Word, and preserves them by his coeternal
   Spirit (Psa. xxxiii. 6; John i. 3). He made all things very good and
   for the use of man (Gen. i. 31).

   We condemn the Manichæans who impiously imagine two coeternal
   principles, the one good, the other evil, and two antagonistic gods.

   Angels and men stand at the head of all creatures. Angels are ministers
   of God (Psa. civ. 4), and ministering spirits sent for them who shall
   be heirs of salvation (Heb. i. 14).

   The devil was a murderer and liar from the beginning (John viii. 44).

   Some angels persevered in obedience, and are ordained unto the faithful
   service of God and men; but others fell of their own accord and ran
   into destruction, and have become enemies of God and men.

   Man was made in the image and likeness of God, and placed by God in
   paradise as ruler over the earth (Gen. i. 27, 28; ii. 8). This is
   celebrated by David in the 8th Psalm. Moreover, God gave him a wife and
   blessed them (Gen. ii. 22 sqq.).

   Man consists of two diverse substances in one person--of an immortal
   soul, which, when separated from the body neither sleeps nor dies, and
   of a mortal body, which at the last judgment, shall be raised again
   from the dead.

   We condemn those who deny the immortality, or affirm the sleep of the
   soul, or teach that it is a part of God.

   Chap. VIII. Of Man's Fall, Sin, and the Cause of Sin.--Man was created
   according to the image of God, in true righteousness and holiness, good
   and upright. But by the instigation of the serpent, and through his own
   guilt, he fell from goodness and rectitude, and became, with all his
   offspring, subject to sin, death, and various calamities.

   Sin is that inborn corruption of man, derived and propagated from our
   first parents, whereby we are immersed in depraved lusts, averse to
   goodness and prone to all evil, and unable of ourselves to do or think
   any thing that is good. And as years roll on, we bring forth evil
   thoughts, words, and deeds, as corrupt trees bring forth corrupt fruits
   (Matt. xii. 33). Therefore we are all by nature under the wrath of God,
   and subject to just punishment.

   By death we understand not only the dissolution of the body, but also
   the eternal punishments of sin (Eph. ii. 1, 5; Rom. v. 12).

   We therefore acknowledge that there is original sin in all men, and
   that all other sins, whether mortal or venial, also the unpardonable
   sin against the Holy Ghost, spring from this same source. We
   acknowledge also that sins are not equal, but some are more grievous
   than others (Matt. x. 14, 15; xi. 24; 1 John v. 16, 17).

   We condemn the Pelagians, who deny original sin; the Jovinianists, who
   with the Stoics declare all sins to be equal; and those who make God
   the author of sin against the express teaching of Scriptures (Psa. v.
   5-7; John viii. 44).

   When God is said to blind or harden men, or to give them over to a
   reprobate mind (Exod. vii. 13; John xii. 40), it is to be understood as
   a righteous judgment. Moreover, God overrules the wickedness of men for
   good, as he did in the case of the brethren of Joseph.

   Chap. IX. Of Free Will and Man's Ability.--The will and moral ability
   of man must be viewed under a threefold state.

   First, before the fall, he had freedom to continue in goodness, or to
   yield to temptation.

   Secondly, after the fall, his understanding was darkened and his will
   became a slave to sin (1 Cor. ii. 14; 2 Cor. iii. 5; John viii. 34;
   Rom. viii. 7). But he has not been turned into 'a stone or stock;' nor
   is his will (voluntas) a non-will (noluntas). [778] He serves sin
   willingly, not unwillingly (servit peccato non nolens, sed volens). In
   external and worldly matters man retains his freedom even after the
   fall, under the general providence of God.

   Thirdly, in the regenerate state, man is free in the true and proper
   sense of the term. His intellect is enlightened by the Holy Spirit to
   understand the mysteries and the will of God; and the will is changed
   by the Spirit and endowed with the power freely to will and to do what
   is good (Rom. viii. 5, 6; Jer. xxxi. 33; Ezek. xxxvi. 26; John viii.
   36; Phil. i. 6, 29; ii. 13).

   In regeneration and conversion men are not merely passive, but also
   active. They are moved by the Spirit of God to do of themselves what
   they do. But even in the regenerate there remains some infirmity. The
   flesh strives against the spirit to the end of life (Rom. vii. 14; Gal.
   v. 17).

   We condemn the Manichæans, who deny that evil originated in the free
   will of man, and the Pelagians, who teach that fallen man has
   sufficient freedom to keep God's commandments. The former are refuted
   by Gen. i. 27; Eccles. vii. 29; the latter by John viii. 36.

   Chap. X. The Predestination of God and the Election of Saints.--God has
   from eternity predestinated or freely chosen, of his mere grace,
   without any respect of men, the saints whom he will save in Christ
   (Eph. i. 4; 2 Tim. i. 9, 10).

   God elected us in Christ and for Christ's sake, so that those who are
   already implanted in Christ by faith are chosen, but those out of
   Christ are rejected (2 Cor. xiii. 5). [779]

   Although God knows who are his, and a 'small number of the elect' is
   spoken of, yet we ought to hope well of all, and not rashly count any
   one among the reprobate (2 Tim. ii. 19; Matt. xx. 16; Phil i. 3 sqq.).

   We reject those who seek out of Christ whether they are chosen, and
   what God has decreed concerning them from eternity. We are to hear the
   gospel and believe it, and be sure that if we believe and are in
   Christ, we are chosen. We must listen to the Lord's invitation, 'Come
   unto me' (Matt. xi. 28), and believe in the unbounded love of God, who
   gave his own Son for the salvation of the world, and will not that 'one
   of these little ones should perish' (John iii. 16; Matt. xviii. 14).
   [780]

   Let, therefore, Christ be the mirror in which we behold our
   predestination. We shall have a sufficiently evident and sure testimony
   of being written in the book of life if we live in communion with him,
   and if in true faith he is ours and we his.

   And if we are tempted concerning our predestination, let this be our
   comfort--that God's promises are general to believers, as he himself
   says: 'Seek, and ye shall find, and whosoever asketh shall receive'
   (Matt. vii. 8 sq.). We pray with the whole Church, 'Our Father which
   art in heaven;' by baptism we are ingrafted into the body of Christ,
   and we are often fed in the Church by his flesh and blood unto life
   everlasting. Thus strengthened, let us 'work out our own salvation with
   fear and trembling, for it, is God who worketh in us both to will and
   to do according to his good pleasure' (Phil. ii. 12, 13). [781]

   Chap. XI. Jesus Christ true God and Man, and the only Saviour of the
   World.--We believe and teach that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, was from eternity predestinated by the Father to be the Saviour
   of the world; that he was begotten of the Father from all eternity in
   an ineffable manner (Isa. liii. 8; Micah v. 2; John i. 1). Therefore
   the Son, according to his Divinity, is coequal and consubstantial with
   the Father; true God, not merely by name or adoption or by conferring
   of a dignity, but in essence and nature (1 John v. 20; Phil. ii. 6;
   Heb. i. 2, 3; John v. 18; xvii. 5).

   We abhor the blasphemous doctrine of Arius and Servetus in opposition
   to the Son of God.

   We also believe and teach that the same eternal Son of God became the
   Son of Man, of the seed of Abraham and David, not through the will of
   man (Ebionites), but he was conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the
   ever-Virgin Mary (ex Maria semper virgine), as taught in the gospel
   history and the Epistles (Matt. i. 18; Luke i. 34, 35; 1 John iv. 3;
   Heb. ii. 16). The body of Christ was therefore neither a mere
   appearance, nor brought down from heaven (the Gnostics, Valentinus and
   Marcion). Moreover his soul was not without reason (Apollinaris), nor
   his flesh without a soul (Eunomius); but he had a rational soul, and a
   flesh with senses capable of true suffering (Matt. xxvi. 36; John xii.
   27).

   Hence we acknowledge in one and the same Lord Jesus Christ two natures,
   a divine and a human, which are conjoined and united in one person
   without absorption or confusion and mixture.

   We worship one Lord Christ, not two; one true God-Man, coequal (or of
   one substance, consubstantialis, homoousios) with the Father as regards
   his divine nature, and coequal with us men, sin only excepted (Heb. iv.
   15), as regards his human nature.

   We therefore abominate Nestorianism, which dissolves the unity of
   person, and Eutychianism, Monothelitism, and Monophysitism, which
   destroy the proper character of the human nature.

   We do not teach that the divine nature of Christ did suffer, nor that
   the human nature of Christ is every where present. The true body of
   Christ was not deified so as to put off its properties and to be
   absorbed into the divine substance. But we believe that our Lord Jesus
   Christ did truly suffer for us in the flesh (1 Pet. iii. 18; iv. 1),
   and that the Lord of glory was crucified for us (1 Cor. ii. 8). For we
   accept believingly and reverently the 'communication of properties,'
   which is deduced from the Scriptures and employed by the ancient Church
   in explaining and harmonizing seemingly contradictory passages. [782]

   We believe and teach that Christ, in the same flesh in which he died,
   rose from the dead (Luke xxiv. 30), and ascended to the right hand of
   God in the highest heaven (Eph. iv. 10), which signifies his elevation
   to the divine majesty and power, but also a definite place (John xiv.
   2; Acts iii. 21).

   The same Christ will come again to judgment, when the wickedness of the
   world shall have reached the highest point, and Antichrist corrupted
   the true religion. He will destroy Antichrist, and judge the quick and
   the dead (2 Thess. ii. 8; Acts xvii. 51, 52; 1 Thess. iv. 17). The
   believers will enter into the mansions of the blessed; the unbelievers,
   with the devil and his angels, will be cast into everlasting torment
   (Matt. xxv. 41; 2 Tim. ii. 11; 2 Pet. iii. 7).

   We reject all who deny the real resurrection; who teach the ultimate
   salvation of all the godless, and even the devil. We also reject the
   Jewish dream of a millennium, or golden age on earth, before the last
   judgment.

   We believe and teach that Christ is the only Redeemer of the whole
   world, in whom all are saved that were saved before the law, under the
   law, and under the gospel, or will yet be saved to the end of the world
   (John x. 1, 7; Acts iv. 12; xv. 11; 1 Cor. x. 1, 4; Rev. xiii. 8).

   We therefore confess and teach with a loud voice: Jesus Christ is the
   only Saviour of the world, the King and High-priest, the true Messiah,
   whom all the shadows and types of the Law and the Prophets did
   prefigure and promise. God did send him to us, and we need not look for
   another. There remains nothing but that we should give all glory to
   him, believe in him, and rest in him alone.

   And, to say much in a few words, we sincerely believe and loudly
   confess all that has been determined out of the Holy Scriptures
   concerning the mystery of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   is contained in the creeds and decrees of the first four oecumenical
   Councils held in Niceæ, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, in the
   Creed of St. Athanasius, and all similar creeds; and we reject all
   contrary to the same. In this manner we retain, unchanged and entire,
   the Christian, orthodox, and catholic faith; knowing that nothing is
   contained in the aforesaid creeds which does not correspond with the
   Word of God and aid in setting forth the true faith. [783]

   Chap. XII. The Law of God.--The law of God explains the will of God and
   the difference between what is good and bad, just and unjust. It is
   therefore good and holy. It is twofold: the law of nature inscribed on
   the hearts of men (Rom. ii. 15), and the written law of Moses. The
   latter we divide for perspicuity's sake into the moral law,
   comprehended in the two tables of the Decalogue (Exod. xx.; Deut. v.);
   the ceremonial law, concerning worship and sacred rites; and the
   judicial, concerning polity and economy.

   The law of God is complete, and allows no addition nor subtraction
   (Deut. iv. 2; Isa. xxx. 21). It is given to us, not that by keeping it
   we might be justified, but that we may be led to a knowledge of sin and
   guilt, and, despairing of our own strength, turn by faith to Christ
   (Rom. iv. 15; iii. 20; viii. 3; Gal. iii. 21-24). Christ is the end of
   the law, and redeemed us from the curse of the law (Rom. x. 4; Gal.
   iii. 13). He enables us to fulfill the law, and his righteousness and
   obedience are imputed to us through faith.

   The law is abolished inasmuch as it no more condemns and works wrath in
   them that believe, who are under grace, and not under the law. Besides,
   Christ has fulfilled all the types of the law, and put the substance in
   the place of the shadows; in him we have all fullness. Nevertheless,
   the law is useful in showing us all virtues and vices, and in
   regulating the life of new obedience. Christ did not come to destroy,
   but to fulfill the law (Matt. v. 17).

   We therefore condemn old and modern Antinomianism.

   Chap. XIII. The Gospel of Jesus Christ.--The law works wrath and
   announces the curse (Rom. iv. 15; Deut. xxvii. 26); the gospel
   announces grace and blessing (John i. 17). Nevertheless, those who
   lived before and under the law were not deprived altogether of the
   gospel, but had great promises (Gen. iii. 15; xxii. 18; xlix. 10). The
   promises were partly temporal, partly spiritual and eternal. By the
   gospel promises the fathers obtained salvation in Christ.

   In the strict sense of the term the gospel is the glad tidings of
   salvation by Christ, in whom we have forgiveness, redemption, and
   everlasting life. Hence the history of Christ recorded by the four
   Evangelists is justly called the gospel.

   Compared with the legalism of the Pharisees the gospel appeared to be a
   new doctrine, as it is even now called new by the Papists; but in fact
   it is the oldest doctrine, for God foreordained from eternity to save
   the world through Christ, and has revealed this plan in the gospel (2
   Tim. i. 9, 10). It is therefore a grave error to call our evangelical
   faith a recent innovation.

   Chap. XIV. Of Repentance and Conversion.--Repentance (metanoia) is a
   change of heart produced in a sinner by the word of the gospel and the
   Holy Spirit, and includes a knowledge of native and actual depravity, a
   godly sorrow and hatred of sin, and a determination to live hereafter
   in virtue and holiness. True repentance is turning to God and all good,
   and turning away from the devil and all evil. It is the free gift of
   God, and not the result of our own strength (2 Tim. ii. 25).

   We have examples of true repentance in the woman that was a sinner
   (Luke vii. 38), in Peter after his fall (xxii. 62), in the prodigal son
   (xv. 18), and the publican in the temple (xviii. 13).

   It is sufficient to confess our sins to God in private and in the
   public service; it is not necessary to confess to a priest, for this is
   nowhere commanded in the Scriptures; although we may seek counsel and
   comfort from a minister of the gospel in time of distress and trial
   (comp. James v. 16).

   The keys of the kingdom of heaven, out of which the Papists forge
   swords, sceptres, and crowns, are given to all legitimate ministers of
   the Church in the preaching of the gospel and the maintenance of
   discipline (Matt. xvi. 19; John xx. 23; Mark xvi. 15; 2 Cor. v. 18,
   19). We condemn the profitable popish doctrine of penance and of
   indulgences, and apply to them Peter's word to Simon Magus: ' Thy money
   perish with thee' (Acts viii. 20).

   Chap. XV. Of True Justification of Believers.--'To justify' means, with
   the Apostle when treating of this subject, to remit sins, to absolve
   from guilt and punishment, to receive into grace, and to pronounce just
   (Rom. viii. 33; Acts xiii. 38; Deut. xxv. 1; Isa. v. 23).

   By nature we are all sinners and guilty of death before the tribunal of
   God, and we can be justified only by the merits of Christ crucified and
   risen again. For his sake God is reconciled, and imputes to us not our
   sins, but the righteousness of Christ as our own, so that we are purged
   and absolved from sin, death and damnation, and heirs of eternal life.
   Properly speaking, God alone justifies and justifies only for Christ's
   sake, not imputing to us our sins, but the righteousness of Christ.

   We therefore teach and believe, with the Apostle, that the sinner is
   justified by faith alone in Christ (sola fide in Christum), not by the
   law, nor by any works (Rom. iii. 28; iv. 2 sqq.; Eph. ii. 8, 9).
   Righteousness is imputed to faith because it receives Christ as our
   righteousness and ascribes all to the grace of God, but not because it
   is our work: it is the gift of God. As we receive food by eating, so
   faith appropriates Christ.

   We do not divide justification by ascribing it partly to the grace of
   God or to Christ, and partly to our works or merits, but solely and
   exclusively to the grace of God in Christ through faith. We must first
   be justified before we can do good works. Love is derived from faith (1
   Tim. i. 5; Gal. v. 6).

   Therefore we speak here not of a false, dead faith, but of a living and
   vivifying faith which lives in Christ, our life, and proves its life by
   living works. Even James (chap. ii.) does not contradict our doctrine,
   for he speaks of a dead faith which even demons have, and he shows that
   Abraham proved his living and justifying faith by works.

   Chap. XVI. Faith and Good Works, their Reward and the Merit of
   Man.--Christian faith is not a human opinion and persuasion, but a most
   firm confidence and clear and steady assent of the mind, a most certain
   apprehension of the truth of God as laid down in the Scriptures and the
   Apostles' Creed, and therefore of God himself as the highest good, and
   especially of the divine promise and of Christ, who is the crown of all
   promises. Such a faith is a free gift of God, who of his grace grants
   it to his elect through his Holy Spirit by means of the preaching of
   the gospel and believing prayer when and in what measure he pleases.
   This faith has degrees and is subject to growth; hence the prayer of
   the Apostles: 'Lord, increase our faith' (Luke xvii. 5). [Then follow a
   number of Scripture proofs: Heb. xi. 1; 2 Cor. i. 20; Phil. i. 29; Rom.
   xii. 3; 2 Thess. ii. 3; Rom. x. 16; Acts xiii. 48; Gal. v. 6, etc.]

   We teach that good works proceed from a living faith, through the Holy
   Spirit, and are done by believers according to the will and rule of the
   Word of God (2 Pet. i. 5 sqq.; 1 Thess. iv. 3, 6, 23).

   Good works must be done, not to merit thereby eternal life, which is a
   free gift of God (Rom. vi. 23), nor for ostentation or from
   selfishness, which the Lord rejects (Matt. vi. 2; xxiii. 5), but for
   the glory of God, to adorn our calling and to show our gratitude to
   God, and for the good of our neighbor (Matt. v. 16; Eph. iv. 1; Col.
   iii. 17; Phil. ii. 4; Tit. iii. 14). Although we teach that man is
   justified by faith of Christ and not by any works, we do not condemn
   good works. Man is created and regenerated by faith in order to work
   unceasingly what is good and useful. 'Every good tree bringeth forth
   good fruit' (Matt. vii. 17). 'He that abideth in me, the same bringeth
   forth much fruit' (John xv. 5). 'We are God's workmanship, created in
   Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we
   should walk in them' (Eph. ii. 10).

   We condemn, therefore, all who despise good works or declare them
   useless; at the same time we do not deem them necessary to salvation,
   in the sense that without them no one was ever saved; for we are saved
   by Christ alone; but good works are necessarily born of faith, and
   improperly salvation may be ascribed to them which properly is ascribed
   to grace (Rom. xi. 6).

   God is well pleased and approves of works which are done by us through
   faith (Acts x. 35; Col. i. 9, 10). He also richly rewards them (Jer.
   xxxi. 16; Matt. v. 12; x. 42). But we ascribe this reward not to the
   merits of man who receives it, but to the goodness and faithfulness of
   God who promises and grants it, although he owes nothing to his
   creatures. Even if we have done all, we are unprofitable servants (Luke
   xvii. 10). We say with Augustine, that God crowns and rewards in us,
   not our merits, but the gifts of his grace. It is a reward of grace,
   not of merit. We have nothing but what we have received (comp. 1 Cor.
   iv. 7).

   We therefore condemn those who so defend the merits of men as to set at
   naught the grace of God.

   Chap. XVII. Of the Catholic and Holy Church of God, and of the only
   Head of the Church.--Since God willed from the beginning that men
   should be saved and come to the knowledge of truth, it follows of
   necessity that there always was, and now is, and shall be to the end of
   time, a Church or an assembly of believers and a communion of saints,
   called and gathered from the world, who know and worship the true God
   in Christ our Saviour, and partake by faith of all the benefits freely
   offered through Christ. They are fellow-citizens of the same household
   of God (Eph. ii. 19). To this refers the article in the Creed: 'I
   believe the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints.'

   And as there is but one God, one Mediator between God and man, Jesus
   the Messiah, one pastor of the whole flock, one head of this body, one
   Spirit, one salvation, one faith, one testament or covenant, there must
   needs be but one Church, which we call catholic, that is, universal,
   spread throughout all parts of the world and all ages.

   We therefore condemn the Donatists, who confined the Church to some
   corners of Africa, and also the Roman exclusiveness, which pretends
   that the Roman Church alone is the catholic Church.

   The Church is divided, not in itself, but on account of the diversity
   of its members. There is a Church militant on earth struggling against
   the flesh, the world, and the devil, and a Church triumphant in heaven
   rejoicing in the presence of the Lord; nevertheless there is a
   communion between the two. The Church militant is again divided into
   particular Churches. It was differently constituted among the
   Patriarchs, then under Moses, then under Christ in the gospel
   dispensation; but there is only one salvation in the one Messiah, in
   whom all are united as members of one body, partaking of the same
   spiritual food and drink. We enjoy a greater degree of light and more
   perfect liberty.

   This Church is called the house of the living God (1 Tim. iii. 15),
   built of lively and spiritual stones (1 Pet. ii. 5), resting on an
   immovable rock, the only foundation (1 Cor. iii. 11), the ground and
   pillar of the truth (1 Tim. iii. 15). It can not err as long as it
   rests on the rock Christ, on the foundation of the Prophets and
   Apostles; but it errs as often as it departs from him who is the truth.
   [784] The Church is also called a virgin, the bride of Christ, the only
   and beloved (2 Cor. xi. 2), and the body of Christ, because the
   believers are living members of Christ under him the head (Eph. i. 23,
   etc.).

   The Church can have no other head than Christ. He is the one universal
   pastor of his flock, and has promised his presence to the end of the
   world. He needs, therefore, no vicar; for this would imply his absence.
   [Those who introduce a double headship and government in the Church
   plainly belong to the errorists condemned by the Apostles (2 Pet. ii.;
   Acts xx.; 2 Cor. xi.; 2 Thess. ii.).] [785]

   But by rejecting the Roman head we do not introduce disorder and
   confusion into the Church of Christ, since we adhere to the government
   delivered by the Apostles before there was any Pope. The Roman head
   preserves the tyranny and corruption in the Church, and opposes and
   destroys all just reformation.

   They object that since our separation from Rome all sorts of
   controversies and divisions have arisen. As if there had never been any
   sects and dissensions in the Roman Church, in the pulpits, and among
   the people! God is indeed a God of order and peace (1 Cor. xiv. 33);
   nevertheless there were parties and divisions even in the Apostles'
   Church (Acts xv.; 1 Cor. iii.; Gal. ii.). God overrules these divisions
   for his glory and for the illustration of truth.

   Communion with the true Church of Christ we highly esteem, and deny
   that those who separate from it can live before God. As there was no
   salvation out of the ark of Noah, so there is no certain salvation out
   of Christ, who exhibits himself to the elect in the Church for their
   nourishment. [786]

   But we do not so restrict the Church as to exclude those who from
   unavoidable necessity and unwillingly do not partake of the sacraments,
   or who are weak in faith, or still have defects and errors. God had
   friends even outside of the Jewish people. We know what happened to
   Peter, and to chosen believers from day to day, and we know that the
   Apostle censured the Christians in Galatia and Corinth for grave
   offenses, and yet calls them holy churches of Christ. Yea, God may at
   times by a righteous judgment allow the Church to be so obscured and
   shaken as to appear almost annihilated, as in the days of Elijah (1
   Kings xix. 18; comp. Rev. vii. 4, 9); but even then he has his true
   worshipers, even seven thousand and more; for 'the foundation of God
   standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his' (2
   Tim. ii. 19). Hence the Church may be called invisible, not that the
   men composing it are invisible, but because they are known only to God,
   while we are often mistaken in our judgment. There are also many
   hypocrites in the Church, who outwardly conform to all the ordinances,
   but will ultimately be revealed in their true character and be cut off
   (1 John ii. 19; Matt. xiii. 24, 47).

   The true unity of the Church is not to be sought in ceremonies and
   rites, but in the truth and in the catholic faith, as laid down in the
   Scriptures and summed up in the Apostles' Creed. Among the ancients
   there was a great diversity of rites without dissolving the unity of
   the Church.

   Chap. XVIII. On the Ministers of the Church, their Institution and
   Offices.--God always used ministers for gathering and governing the
   Church (Rom. x. 14, 17; John xiii. 20; Acts xvi. 9; 1 Cor. iii. 9,
   etc.).

   God employed the Patriarchs, Moses, and the Prophets as teachers of
   their age. At last he sent his only-begotten Son, filled with infinite
   wisdom, to be our infallible guide. Christ chose the Apostles, and
   these ordained pastors in all the Churches (Acts xiv. 23), whose
   successors have taught and governed the Church to this day.

   The ministers of the New Testament are called Apostles, prophets,
   evangelists, bishops, presbyters, pastors, and teachers (1 Cor. xii.
   28; Eph. iv. 11). In subsequent times other names were introduced, as
   patriarchs, archbishops, metropolitans, archpresbyters, deacons, and
   subdeacons, etc. But we are satisfied with the offices instituted by
   the Apostles for the teaching and governing of the Church.

   A minister should be lawfully called and chosen by the Church, and
   excel in sacred learning, pious eloquence, prudence, and unblemished
   character (1 Tim. iii. 2; Tit. i. 5). When elected, a minister should
   be ordained of the elders by public prayer and the laying on of hands.
   We reject arbitrary intruders and incompetent pastors. But we
   acknowledge that innocent simplicity may be more useful than haughty
   learning.

   A minister of the New Testament is not a priest, as in the Jewish
   dispensation, offering sacrifices for the living and the dead. Christ
   is our eternal High-priest, who fulfilled and abolished typical
   sacrifices by his one perfect sacrifice on the cross; and all believers
   are priests offering spiritual sacrifices--namely, thanksgiving and
   praise to God continually.

   All ministers are equal in power and commission. Bishops and presbyters
   were originally the same in office, and governed the Church by their
   united services, mindful of the words of the Lord: 'He who will be
   chief among you, let him be your servant' (Luke xxii. 26). Jerome (Com.
   on Titus) says: 'Before, by the instigation of the devil, party spirit
   and sectarianism arose, the churches were governed by the common
   counsel of the presbyters; but afterwards, when every one thought that
   those whom he had baptized belonged to him, not to Christ, it was
   decreed that one of the presbyters should by election be placed over
   the rest, and be intrusted with the care of the whole Church, and thus
   the seed of schisms be destroyed.' But Jerome does not present this
   decree as divine, for he soon adds that presbyters and bishops know
   that this distinction is based on ecclesiastical custom, and not on
   divine command. Therefore no one can be lawfully forbidden to return
   from human custom to the ancient constitution of the Church of Christ.

   The chief duties of ministers are the preaching of the gospel, the
   administration of the sacraments, the care of souls, and the
   maintenance of discipline. To do this effectually they must live in the
   fear of God, pray constantly, study the Scriptures diligently, be
   always watchful, and shine before all by purity of life. In the
   exercise of discipline, they should remember that the power was given
   to them for edification and not for destruction (2 Cor. x. 8; comp.
   Matt. xiii. 29).

   We reject the error of the Donatists, who make the efficacy of the
   preaching and the sacraments to depend on the moral character of the
   minister. The voice of Christ must be heard and obeyed even out of the
   mouth of an unworthy servant (Matt. xxiii. 3); and the sacraments are
   efficacious to the worthy recipient by virtue of their divine
   appointment and the Word of Christ. On these things St. Augustine has
   much disputed from the Scriptures against the Donatists.

   Nevertheless, proper control and discipline should be exercised over
   the doctrine and conduct of ministers in synods. False or immoral
   teachers should not be tolerated, but warned or deposed. We do not
   disapprove general or oecumenical councils if they are conducted,
   according to the apostolic example (Acts xv.), for the welfare, and not
   for the corruption of the Church.

   As the laborer is worthy of reward, the minister is entitled to the
   maintenance of himself and family from the congregation he serves (1
   Cor. ix. 9 sqq.; 1 Tim. v. 18, etc.). Against the Anabaptists, who
   denounce ministers living off their ministry.

   Chap. XIX. The Sacraments of the Church of Christ.--With the preaching
   of the Word are joined sacraments or sacred rites instituted by God as
   signs and seals of his promises for the strengthening of our faith, and
   as pledges on our part for our consecration to him.

   The sacraments of the Jewish dispensation were circumcision and the
   paschal lamb; the sacraments of the Christian dispensation are baptism
   and the Lord's Supper.

   The Papists count seven sacraments. Of these we acknowledge repentance,
   ordination of ministers, and marriage as useful institutions of God,
   but not as sacraments. Confirmation and extreme unction are inventions
   of men, which may be abolished without any loss. We abhor all
   merchandise carried on with the sacraments by Romish priests.

   The supreme benefit of the sacraments is Christ the Saviour, that Lamb
   of God slain for our sins from the foundation of the world, and that
   Rock of which all our fathers drank. So far the sacraments of the Old
   and New Testaments are the same. But we have the abiding substance.

   Sacraments consist of the Word, the sign, and the thing signified. By
   the Word of God and institution of Christ they become sacraments and
   are sanctified. The sign in baptism is water, the thing signified is
   regeneration or the washing from sins. The sign in the Lord's Supper is
   bread and wine, the thing signified is the veritable body and blood of
   Christ sacrificed for us. The signs are not changed into the things
   signified; for then they would cease to be sacramental signs,
   representing the things signified; but they are sacred and efficacious
   signs and seals. For he who instituted baptism and the Supper intended
   that we should receive not the outward form only, but the inward
   blessing, that we should be truly washed from all our sins through
   faith, and be made partakers of Christ.

   The truth and power of the sacraments depend neither on the worthiness
   of the minister nor that of the receiver, but on the faithfulness of
   God. Unbelievers do not receive the things offered; but the fault is in
   men, whose unbelief doth not annul the faith of God (Rom. iii. 3).

   Chap. XX. Of Holy Baptism.-- Baptism is instituted by Christ (Matt.
   xxviii. 19; Mark xvi. 15). There is only one baptism in the Church; it
   lasts for life, and is a perpetual seal of our adoption. To be baptized
   in the name of Christ is to be enrolled, initiated, and received into
   the covenant, into the family and the inheritance of the sons of God,
   that, cleansed from our sins by the blood of Christ, we may lead a new
   and innocent life. We are internally regenerated by the Holy Ghost, but
   we receive publicly the seal of these blessings by baptism. Water
   washes away filth, and refreshes and comforts the body; the grace of
   God inwardly and invisibly cleanses the soul.

   By baptism, we are separated from the world and consecrated to God. In
   baptism we confess our faith and pledge obedience to God. We are
   enrolled into the holy army of Christ to fight against the World, the
   flesh, and the devil.

   Later human additions to the primitive form of baptism, such as
   exorcism, the use of burning light, oil, salt, spittle, we judge to be
   unnecessary.

   Baptism is not to be administered by women or by midwives, but by the
   ministers of the Church.

   We condemn those who deny that children of believers should be
   baptized. For to children belongs the kingdom of God, and they are in
   covenant with God--why then should not the sign of the covenant be
   given to them? We are therefore no Anabaptists, and have no communion
   with them.

   Chap. XXI. Of the Holy Supper of our Lord.--The Lord's Supper, or
   Eucharist, is a grateful commemoration of the benefits of redemption,
   and a spiritual feast of believers instituted by Christ, wherein he
   nourishes us with his own flesh and blood by true faith unto eternal
   life. It signifies and seals to us the greatest benefit and blessing
   ever conferred on the race of mortals, that he truly delivered his body
   and shed his blood for the remission of our sins. In it we eat his
   flesh which is meat indeed, and drink his blood which is drink indeed
   (Matt xxvi. 20 sqq.; Luke xxii. 19; 1 Cor. xi. 21 sqq.; John vi. 51
   sqq.).

   This eating is not corporeal and Capernaitic, by the mouth and the
   stomach, but spiritual, i.e., by the Holy Ghost through faith. 'The
   flesh,' corporeally eaten, 'profiteth nothing; it is the spirit that
   quickeneth' (John vi. 63). 'I am the bread of life; he that cometh unto
   me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst'
   (John vi. 51). So that eating and drinking here means to come unto
   Christ and to believe in him. As Augustine says: 'Why preparest thou
   the tooth and the stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten.'

   Besides the spiritual eating, in the daily communion of the soul with
   Christ, there is also a sacramental eating, whereby the believer not
   only inwardly partakes of Christ, but also receives the visible signs
   and seals of his body and blood at the Lord's table. [787] And with the
   signs he receives the thing itself. [788] He is nourished and
   strengthened by spiritual food. The signs are also sure pledges that
   Christ died not only for men in general, but also individually for
   every believing communicant. Besides, in partaking of this ordinance we
   obey the command of our Lord, celebrate his atoning death, give thanks
   for the great redemption, and openly profess our faith before the
   congregation.

   But those who commune unworthily and without faith receive only the
   visible signs to their own condemnation or judgment (1 Cor. xi. 27
   sqq.).

   We therefore do not so conjoin the body and blood of Christ with bread
   and wine as to say that the bread itself is the body (except
   sacramentally), or that the body of Christ is corporeally hid under the
   bread, aud should be adored under the form of bread, or that whosoever
   receives the signs receives also necessarily the thing itself. [Against
   the Lutheran theory.] The body of Christ is in heaven at the right hand
   of the Father (Mark xvi. 19; Heb. viii. 1; xii. 2); and hence we must
   raise our hearts to heaven.

   And yet he is not absent from his people when they celebrate his
   communion. For as the sun in heaven is efficaciously present with us,
   so much more is Christ the sun of righteousness with us, not, indeed,
   corporeally, but spiritually by his enlivening and vivifying operation,
   even as he in the Last Supper explained that he himself would be
   present with us (John xiv.-xvi.). Hence we have not a Supper without
   Christ, but an unbloody and mystical Supper, as universal antiquity
   called it.

   Moreover, the Lord's Supper reminds us that we are members of his body,
   and should live peaceably with all our brethren, and grow and persevere
   in holiness of life.

   Therefore it is very proper that we should duly prepare ourselves by
   self-examination in regard to our repentance and faith in Christ (1
   Cor. xi. 28).

   As to the external celebration, we adhere to the original form,
   consisting in the annunciation of the Word of God, devout prayers, the
   Lord's action, and its repetition in breaking bread, and distributing
   it together with the wine, in eating the body and drinking the blood of
   our Lord, in grateful remembrance of his death, in thanksgiving, and in
   holy reunion of the brethren as one body.

   We disapprove of the withdrawal of the cup contrary to the express
   command of our Lord: 'Drink ye all of it' (Matt. xxvi. 27).

   The mass--whatever it may have been in ancient times--has been turned
   from a salutary institution into a vain show, and surrounded with
   various abuses, which justify its abolition.

   Chap. XXII. Of Sacred and Ecclesiastical Assemblies.--It is lawful and
   right for all men privately to read the Scriptures for edification. At
   the same time the maintenance of religion demands regular public
   services. These should be conducted decently, in order, and for
   edification, in the language understood by the people.

   Chap. XXIII. Of Church Prayers, Singing, and Canonical Hours.--Public
   prayers in sacred assemblies should be made in the vulgar tongue
   understood by all. Every prayer is to be offered to God alone, through
   the sole mediation of Christ, not to saints or through them. Churches
   are at liberty to vary from the usual forms. Prayers are not
   superstitiously to be confined to particular places or hours. Long and
   tedious prayers in public assemblies should be avoided. Singing is not
   indispensable, but lawful and desirable. Canonical hours are not
   prescribed in the Scriptures, and are unknown to antiquity.

   Chap. XXIV. Of Feasts, Fasts, and the Choice of Meats.--The Lord's day
   is consecrated, from the times of the Apostles, to the worship of God
   and to sacred rest. But we observe it in Christian freedom, not with
   Jewish superstition, neither do we believe that one day is in itself
   holier than another.

   If congregations in addition commemorate the Lord's nativity,
   circumcision, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and the
   outpouring of the Holy Ghost, we greatly approve of it. But feasts
   instituted by men in honor of saints we reject, though the memory of
   the saints is profitable, and should be commended to the people with
   exhortations to follow their virtues.

   True Christian fasting consists in temperance, abstinence,
   watchfulness, self-government, and chastisement of our flesh, that we
   may the easier obey the Spirit. Such fasting is a help to prayer and
   all virtues.

   There are also public fasts appointed in times of affliction and
   calamity, when people abstain from food altogether till evening, and
   spend all time in prayer and repentance. Such fasts are mentioned by
   the Prophets (Joel ii. 12 sq.), and should be observed when the Church
   is afflicted and oppressed. Private fasts are observed by each of us as
   we may judge it profitable to our souls.

   All fasts ought to proceed from a free and willing mind, and be
   observed in a spirit of true humility, in order to vanquish the flesh
   and to serve God more fervently, but not in order to gain the favor of
   men or the merit of righteousness.

   The fast, of forty days (Lent) has the testimony of antiquity, but is
   not enjoined in the Scriptures, and ought not to be imposed upon the
   conscience of the faithful. There was great diversity and freedom in
   the early Church as to the time of fasting, as we learn from Irenæus,
   and Socrates the historian.

   As to the choice of meats, we hold that in fasts we should abstain from
   all such food or drink as stimulates the carnal desires. But otherwise
   we know that all the creatures of God are good (Gen. i. 31), and may be
   used without distinction, but with moderation and thanksgiving (1 Cor.
   x. 25; Tit. i. 15). Paul calls the prohibition of meats a doctrine of
   the demons (1 Tim. iv. 1 sqq.), and reproves those who by excessive
   abstinence wish to acquire the fame of sanctity.

   Chap. XXV. Of Catechizing, and of the Visitation and Consolation of the
   Sick.--The greatest care is to be bestowed on the religious instruction
   of the youth, especially in the Ten Commandments, the Apostles' Creed,
   the Lord's Prayer, and the nature of the sacraments. Churches should
   see to it that children receive catechetical instruction.

   It is one of the chief duties of Christian pastors to visit, comfort,
   and strengthen the sick, and pray for them in private and in public.
   But the extreme unction of the Papists we disapprove.

   Chap. XXV. Of the Burial of the Faithful, the Care of the Dead, of
   Purgatory, and the Apparition of Spirits.--The bodies of believers,
   which are the temples of the Holy Ghost, and will rise again in the
   last day, should be honorably committed to the earth, without
   superstition, and their relatives, widows, and orphans should be
   tenderly cared for.

   We believe that the faithful after death go directly to Christ, and
   need not the prayers of the living. Unbelievers are cast into hell,
   from which there is no escape.

   The doctrine of purgatory is opposed to the Scriptures, and to the
   plenary expiation and cleansing through Christ (comp. John v. 24; xiii.
   10).

   The tales about the souls of the departed appearing to the living and
   requesting their services for deliverance we judge to be mockeries or
   deceptions of the devil. The Lord forbids necromancy (Deut. xviii. 10);
   and the rich man was told that if his brethren on earth hear not Moses
   and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rose from
   the dead (Luke xvi. 30).

   Chap. XXVII. Of Rights and Ceremonies.--The ceremonial law of the Jews
   was a schoolmaster and guardian to lead them to Christ, the true
   Liberator, who abrogated it so that believers are no more under the
   law, but under the gospel freedom. The Apostles would not lay the
   burden of Jewish ceremonies on the new converts (Acts xv. 28). The more
   of human rites are accumulated in the Church, the more it is drawn away
   from Christian liberty and from Christ himself, while the ignorant seek
   in ceremonies what they should seek in Christ through faith. A few pure
   and moderate rites consistent with the Word of God are sufficient.

   Difference in ceremonies, such as existed in the ancient Church, and
   exists now among us, need not to interfere with union and harmony in
   doctrine and faith. In things indifferent, which are neither good nor
   evil, the Church has always used liberty (1 Cor. viii. 10; x. 27 sqq.).

   Chap. XXVIII. Of Church Property.--The wealth of the Church should be
   used for the maintenance of public worship and schools, the support of
   ministers and teachers, and especially also for the benefit of the
   poor.

   Misapplication and abuse of Church property through ignorance or
   avarice is a sacrilege, and calls for reformation.

   Chap. XXIX. Of Celibacy, Marriage, and Economy.--Those who have the
   gift of celibacy from heaven, so as to be pure and continent from their
   whole heart, may serve the Lord in that vocation in simplicity and
   humility, without exalting themselves above others. If not, they should
   remember the apostolic word: 'It is better to marry than to burn' (1
   Cor. vii. 9).

   Marriage (the remedy for incontinence, and continence itself) was
   instituted by God, who blessed it richly, and inseparably joined man
   and woman to live together in intimate love and harmony (Matt. xix. 5).
   Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed is undefiled (Heb. xiii. 4; 1
   Cor. vii. 28).

   We condemn polygamy, and those who reject second marriages.

   Marriage should be contracted in the fear of the Lord, with the consent
   of parents or their representatives, and for the end for which it was
   instituted.

   Children should be brought up in the fear of the Lord, properly
   supported by their parents (1 Tim. v. 8), and be taught honest arts or
   trades.

   We condemn the doctrine which forbids marriage, or indirectly slights
   it as unholy and unclean (1 Tim. iv. 1). We execrate unclean celibacy,
   secret and open fornications, and the pretended continency of
   hypocrites.

   Chap. XXX. Of the Magistrate.-- The civil magistrate is appointed by
   God himself (Rom. xiii.) for the peace and tranquillity of the human
   race. If opposed to the Church, he can do much harm: if friendly, he
   can do the Church most useful service.

   The duty of the magistrate is to preserve peace and public order; to
   promote and protect religion and good morals; to govern the people by
   righteous laws; to punish the offenders against society, such as
   thieves, murderers, oppressors, blasphemers, and incorrigible heretics
   (if they are really heretics). [789]

   Wars are justifiable only in self-defense, and after all efforts at
   peace have been exhausted.

   We condemn the Anabaptists, who maintain that a Christian should not
   hold a civil office, that the magistrate has no right to punish any one
   by death, or to make war, or to demand an oath.

   All citizens owe reverence and obedience to the magistrate as the
   minister of God in all righteous commands, and even their lives when
   the public safety and welfare require it. Therefore we condemn the
   despisers of the magistrate, rebels and enemies of the commonwealth,
   and all who openly or artfully refuse to perform their duties as
   citizens.

   We pray to God, our merciful heavenly Father, to bestow his blessing
   upon princes and rulers, upon us, and upon all his people, through
   Jesus Christ our only Lord and Saviour: to whom be praise, and glory,
   and thanksgiving, forever and ever. Amen.

   [764] He was one of five sons of Dean Bullinger, who, like many priests
   of those days, in open violation of the laws of celibacy, lived in
   regular wedlock, but was much respected and beloved even by his bishop
   of Constance. He opposed Samson's traffic in indulgences, and became
   afterwards a Protestant through the influence of his son.

   [765] Bishop Hooper wrote from prison shortly before his martyrdom, May
   and December, 1554, to Bullinger, as 'his revered father and guide,'
   and the best friend he had ever found, and commended to him his wife
   and two children (Pestalozzi, l.c. p. 445).

   [766] Three letters of this singularly accomplished and pious lady, the
   great-granddaughter of Henry VII., to Bullinger, full of affection and
   gratitude, are still preserved as jewels in the City Library of Zurich,
   but his letters to her are lost. She translated a part of his book on
   Christian marriage into Greek, and asked his advice about learning
   Hebrew. Edward VI., against the will of Henry VIII., bequeathed his
   crown to Lady Jane Grey to save the Protestant religion, and this led
   to her execution at the Tower of London, Feb. 12, 1554, by order of
   Queen Mary. She met her fate with the spirit of a martyr, and sent, as
   a last token of friendship, her gloves to Bullinger, which were long
   preserved in his family (Pestalozzi, l.c. p. 445).

   [767] See the Zurich Letters, published by 'The Parker Society,'
   Cambridge, second edition (chronologically arranged in one series),
   1846. They contain, mostly from the archives of Zurich (the Simmler
   Collection), Geneva, and Berne, letters of Bishops John Jewel, John
   Parkhurst, Edmund Grindal, Edwin Sandys, Horn, John Foxe, Sir A. Cook,
   and others to Bullinger, as also to Gualter (Zwingli's son-in-law),
   Peter Martyr, Simmler, Lavater, Calvin, and Beza. The news of
   Bullinger's death was received in England with great grief. W. Barlow
   wrote to J. Simmler (Bullinger's son-in-law), March 13, 1576 (p. 494):
   ' How great a loss your Church has sustained by the death of the elder
   Bullinger, of most happy memory, yea, and our Church also, towards
   which I have heard that he always entertained a truly fraternal and
   affectionate regard, and indeed all the Churches of Christ throughout
   Europe.' Bishop Cox wrote to Gualter in the same year (p. 496): 'My
   sorrow was excessive for the death of Henry Bullinger, whom, by his
   letters and learned and pious writings, I had . . . known intimately
   for many years, although he was never known personally to me. Who would
   not be made sorrowful by the loss of such and so great a man, and so
   excellent a friend? not to mention that the whole Christian Church is
   disquieted with exceeding regret that so bright a star is forbidden any
   longer to shine upon earth.'

   [768] See Bullinger's notes to the list of his writings; J. H.
   Hottinger, Schola Tigurina, p. 76; J. J. Simmler, Oratio de historia
   Confessionis Helveticæ, in Simmler's Collection, as quoted by
   Pestalozzi, l.c. pp. 416 sq. and 641. Also J. J. Hottinger, Helvet.
   Kirchengesch. Pt. III. p. 894.

   [769] The full title is: 'Confessio et Expositio simplex Orthodoxæ
   Fidei, et Dogmatum Catholicorum synceræ Religionis Christianæ.
   Concorditer ab Ecclesiæ Christi Ministris, qui sunt in Helvetia,

   justitiam, ore autem confessio fit ad salutem. Tiguri: Excudebat
   Christophorus Froschoverus, Mense Martio, MDLXVI.' Glarus, Basle,
   Appenzell, Neufchatel, Poland, Hungary, and Scotland, which we have
   included in brackets, approved the Confession at a later period, and
   hence are not mentioned in the first edition, but partly in the second
   edition of 1568, and more fully in those of 1644 and 1651.

   [770] The ministers of Scotland wrote to Beza, September, 1566:
   'Subscripsimus omnes, qui in hoc coetu interfuimus, et hujus Academiæ
   sigillo publico obsignavimus.' This is stated after the Preface in the
   edition of the Corpus et Syntagma, and in Niemeyer, p. 465, but without
   naming the coetus and Academia.

   [771] I find no evidence of a formal sanction by the Anglican Church;
   but that the Confession was well received there may be inferred from
   the high esteem in which Bullinger was held (see p. 391), and still
   more from the fact that his Decades (a popular compend of theology in
   five series of sermons, each containing ten sermons) were, next to
   Calvin's Institutes, the highest theological authority in England, and
   were recommended, as late as 1586, to the study of young curates along
   with the Bible. See Ch. Hardwick: A History of the Christian Church
   during the Reformation (third edition, London, 1873, p. 241), where the
   following order of the Southern Convocation is quoted from Wilkins, IV.
   321: 'Every minister having cure, and being under the degrees of master
   of arts and bachelor of law, and not licensed to be a public preacher,
   shall, before the second day of February next, provide a Bible, and
   Bullinger's Decades in Latin and English, and a paper book,' etc. On
   Bullinger's Decades, and his abridgment of the same in the Handbook of
   the Christian Religion (1556), see Pestalozzi, pp. 386, 469, 505 sqq.

   [772] See Niemeyer, Proleg. p. lxvii. sq.

   [773] Several creeds bear the name of Damasus, and are given by Hahn,
   Bibliothek der Symbole, pp. 179-190. The form inserted in the
   Confession is from a letter to Jerome (Opera, ed. Vallarsi, Tom. XI. p.
   145), and is thus referred to in the Imperial edict: 'Cunctos populos .
   . . in ea volumus religione versari quam divinum Petrum Apostolum
   tradidisse Romanis . . . quamque Pontificem Damasum sequi claret, et
   Petrum Alexandriæ Episcopum, virum Apostolicæ sanctitatis.'

   [774] I add some testimonies on the Second Helvetic Confession.
   Hagenbach (l.c. p. 86): 'In ihrer ganzen Anlage and in der Durchführung
   einzelner Punkte, namentlich in praktischer Beziehung (in der Scheidung
   des Geistlichen and Weltlichen, u.s.w.) ist sie ein wahres dogmatisches
   Kunstwerk zu nennen.' Pestalozzi (Bullinger, p. 422): 'Diese
   Confession, zu der Bullinger zweimal Angesichts des Todes sich
   bekannte, erscheint als das reife Ergebniss seines Glaubenslebens,
   seiner reichen inneren und äusseren Erfahrung, als der Inbegriff seiner
   theologischen Ueberzeugung wie seiner kirchlichen Grundsätze, als die
   ächte, wahrhafte Entwicklung und Fortbildung seiner früheren
   Bekenntnisse, zumal der ersten helvetischen Confession (von 1536). Sie
   ist ein Muster von Klarheit und Einfachheit, wie selbst hervorragende
   Gegner anerkennen, ausgezeichnet durch den Ueberblick, der das Ganze
   der christlichen Lehre umfasst, der völlige Ausdruck von Bullingers
   Gesinnung, scharf ausgeprägt gegenüber den Verirrungen des
   römisch-katholischen Kirchenthums, milde in Bezug auf die lutherischen
   Besonderheiten, ohne doch der eigenen Ueberzeugung irgend Eintrag zu
   thun. Was aber vornehmlich beachtenswerth, sie ist durchaus getragen
   von dem vollen, klaren und ruhigen Bewusstsein, das mit so
   durchgreifender Kräftigkeit Bullinger beseelte, der ächten
   apostolischen und katholischen Kirche anzugehören, der wahrhaft
   berechtigten und rechtgläubigen Kirche Christi. Sie ist fern davon,
   bloss mit der Bibel in der Hand alles das zu verwerfen, was nicht
   ausdrücklich in der heiligen Schrift gelehrt und geboten ist, wiewohl
   ihr diese von höchster Geltung ist, als oberste Richtschnur der
   christlichen Wahrheit. Sie bricht nicht mit dem geschichtlich
   Gewordenen (der Ueberlieferung), ausser sofern dieses der Schrift nicht
   gemäss ist. Die ganze Entwicklung der christlichen Kirche seit den
   Tagen der Apostel bis auf die Gegenwart ist ihr von hohem Werthe und
   findet ihre ernste Berücksichtigung, nur dass sie sich nach der
   obersten Norm muss richten lassen. Insofern steht sie mit ihrer
   evangelischen Schwesterkirche lutherischen Bekenntnisses ganz auf
   demselben Boden und kann ihr stets die Hand reichen zur Annäherung,
   möglicher Weise auch zu einer Einigung, wenn gleich die Auffassung der
   christlichen Wahrheit nach gewissen Richtungen hin sich unterscheiden
   und deshalb die Entscheidung über diese oder jene einzelnen Lehrpunkte
   und Gebräuche verschieden ausfallen mag.' Dr. Hodge (Syst. Theol. Vol.
   III. p. 634): 'The Second Helvetic Confession is, on some accounts, to
   be regarded as the most authoritative symbol of the Reformed Church, as
   it was more generally received than any other, and was sanctioned by
   different parties.'

   [775] The full Latin text will be found in Vol. III.

   [776] This is the first symbolical exclusion of the Apocrypha from the
   Canon. The Lutheran symbols leave this question open.

   [777] Here we have a clear recognition of secondary causes in
   opposition to fatalism and determinism which has sometimes been charged
   upon Calvinism. The Westminster Confession (Chap. III.) is still more
   explicit: 'God from all eternity did by the most wise and holy counsel
   of his own will freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to
   pass; yet so as thereby neither is God the author of sin; nor is
   violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or
   contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established (Acts
   ii. 23; iv. 27, 28; xvii. 23, 24, comp. with 36; Matt. xvii. 12; John
   xix. 11; Prov. xvi. 33).

   [778] Expressions used by Luther, Flacius, and the Formula of Concord.
   The Helvetic and other Reformed Confessions are much more guarded on
   this point, and teach that man, though totally depraved, remains a
   moral and responsible being in the act of sinning. Melanchthon, in his
   later period, came to the same view, but went beyond it into synergism.
   Comp. above, pp. 262, 270.

   [779] 'Ergo non sine medio, licet non propter ullum meritum nostrum,
   sed in Christo et propter Christum nos elegit Deus, ut qui jam sunt in
   Christo insiti per fidem, illi ipsi etiam sint electi, reprobi vero,
   qui sunt extra Christum.'

   [780] Comp. ver. 10 and 11. A very strong passage for the doctrine of
   infant salvation, and so understood by Zwingli and Bullinger.

   [781] This Tenth Article is moderately Calvinistic or Augustinian, and
   neither Arminian nor Melanchthonian (synergistic), as has sometimes
   been claimed. Comp. Schweizer, Centraldogmen, Vol. I. p. 476; also
   Sudhof's art. in Herzog.

   [782] 'Nam communicationem idiomatum ex Scripturis petitam et ab
   universa vetustate in explicandis componendisque Scripturarum locis in
   speciem pugnantibus usurpatam, religiose et reverenter recipimus et
   usurpamus.' It is an error, therefore, to charge the Reformed Church
   with rejecting the communicatio idiomatum. It admits the communication
   of the properties of one nature to the whole person, but denies the
   communication of the properties of one nature to the other, viz., the
   genus majestaticum, so called, whereby the infinite attributes of the
   divine nature (as omnipresence and omnipotence) are ascribed to the
   human nature, and the genus tapeinoticon, whereby the finite attributes
   of the human nature are ascribed to the divine. Either of these forms
   leads necessarily to a Eutychian confusion of natures. The Lutheran
   Church teaches the genus majestaticum, as a support to its doctrine of
   the Eucharist, but rejects the genus tapeinoticon.

   [783] An express and emphatic indorsement of the oecumenical Creeds, on
   the ground of their agreement with the Scriptures: 'Et ut paucis multa
   hujus causæ dicamus, quæcunque de incarnationis Domini nostri Jesu
   Christi mysterio definita sunt ex Scripturis sanctis, et comprehensa
   symbolis ac sententiis quatuor primarum et proestantissimarum Synodorum
   celebratarum Niceæ, Constantinopoli, Ephesi, et Chalcedone, una cum
   beati Athanasii Symbolo, et omnibus his similibus symbolis, credimus
   corde syncero, et ore libero ingenue profitemur, condemnantes omnia his
   contraria. Atque ad hunc modum retinemus inviolatam sive integram fidem
   Christianam, orthodoxam atque catholicam: scientes, symbolis prædictis
   nihil contineri, quod non sit conforme Verbo Dei, et prorsus faciat ad
   synceram fidei explicationem.'

   [784] 'Non errat illa, quamdiu innititur petræ Christo et fundamento
   Prophetarum et Apostolorum. Nec mirum, si erret, quoties deserit illum,
   qui solus est veritas.'

   [785] The passage in brackets, according to the Zurich MS., was
   substituted by Bullinger on the margin for the following sentence,
   which he wished to have canceled (see note in Niemeyer, p. 501): 'We
   reject the Romish fiction concerning an official head and title of the
   servant of the servants of Christ; for experience proves that this is
   an empty boast, and that the Pope makes himself an enemy of Christ, and
   exalts himself above God, sitting in the temple of God, and showing
   himself that he is God' (2 Thess. ii. 4).

   [786] 'Ut extra arcam Noë non erat ulla salus, pereunte mundo in
   diluvio, ita credimus, extra Christum, qui se electis in Ecclesia
   fruendum proebet, nullam esse salutem certam: et proinde docemus,
   vivere volentes non oportere separari a vera Christi Ecclesia.' This
   high estimate of the Church reminds one of Cyprian's 'Extra ecclesiam
   nulla salus,' of Tertullian's 'Qui ecclesiam non habet matrem, Deum non
   habet patrem,' and of Augustine's 'Ego evangelio non crederem, nisi me
   commoveret ecclesiæ auctoritas.' Calvin, in his Institutes (lib. IV. c.
   1), uses similar language. But we must remember that the Calvinistic
   system does not bind election to the visible means of grace, and admits
   the possibility of salvation without baptism. Bullinger denies only the
   certainty of salvation (salutem certam) outside of the Church (comp.
   above what follows); and so must be understood the Westminster
   Confession of Faith, Ch. XXV. 2, when it asserts that out of the
   visible catholic or universal Church 'there is no ordinary possibility
   of salvation.'

   [787] 'Præter superiorem manducationem spiritualem est et sacramentalis
   manducatio corporis Domini, qua fidelis non tantum spiritualiter et
   interne participat vero corpore et sanguine Domini, sed foris etiam
   accedendo ad mensam Domini accipit visibile corporis et sanguinis
   Domini sacramentum.' This is strangely mistranslated by Owen Jones
   (l.c. p. 173): 'Moreover, also, the sacramental eating of the body of
   the Lord is a superior spiritual eating,' etc. Bullinger rightly
   distinguishes between the purely spiritual communion with Christ's
   flesh and blood (i.e., his real humanity), spoken of in the sixth
   chapter of John, and the sacramental communion in the Eucharist, which
   includes all the benefit of the former with the additional blessing of
   the visible signs and seals of Christ's body broken for us, and
   Christ's blood shed for us.

   [788] 'Qui foris vera fide sacramentum percipit, idem ille non signum
   duntaxat percipit, sed re ipsa quoque, ut diximus, fruitur.'

   [789] 'Coërceat et hæreticos (qui rere hæretici sunt) incorrigibiles,
   Dei majestatem blasphemare et Ecclesiam Dei conturbare, adeoque perdere
   non desinentes.' The same view of the right and duty of the civil
   government to punish heretics is expressed in other Confessions. The
   Reformers differed from the Roman Catholics, not so much in the
   principle of persecution as in the definition of heresy and the degree
   of punishment. Nevertheless, the Reformation inaugurated the era of
   religious toleration and freedom.

   CALVIN'S LIFE

   After the death of Zwingli and the treaty of Cappel (1531), the
   progress of the Reformation was checked in German Switzerland, but only
   to make a more important conquest in French Switzerland, and from
   thence with the course of empire to move westward to France, Holland,
   beyond the Channel, and beyond the seas.

   The supremacy passed from Zurich to Geneva. Providence had silently
   prepared the person and the place. The 'little corner' on the borders
   of Switzerland and France, known since the days of Julius Caesar, was
   predestinated, by its location and preceding history, for a great
   international mission, and has nobly fulfilled it, not only in the
   period of the Reformation of the Church, but also in the nineteenth
   century on the field of international law and peaceful arbitration.
   After varying fortunes, Geneva became an independent asylum of civil
   and religious freedom, and furnished the best base of operation for
   John Calvin, who, though a Frenchman by birth and a Swiss by adoption,
   was a cosmopolitan in spirit, and acted as the connecting link between
   the Germanic and Latin races in the work of reform. Farel, Viret, and
   Froment had destroyed the power of Popery, but to Calvin was left the
   more difficult task of reconstruction and permanent organization.

   John Calvin, [790] the greatest theologian and disciplinarian of the
   giant race of the Reformers, and for commanding intellect, lofty
   character, and far-reaching influence one of the foremost leaders in
   the history of Christianity, was born at Noyon, in Picardy, July 10,
   1509. His father, Gerard Chauvin, a man of severe morals, was secretary
   to the Bishop of Noyon; his mother, a beautiful and devout, but
   otherwise not remarkable woman. He received his first training with the
   children of a noble family (de Mommor), to which he was gratefully
   attached. His ambitious father destined him for the clerical
   profession, and secured him even in his twelfth year the benefice of a
   chaplaincy of the cathedral--an abuse not infrequent in those days of
   decay of ecclesiastical discipline. He received the tonsure, but not
   the ordination for the priesthood; while Zwingli and Knox were once
   priests, and Luther both priest and doctor, in the Church they were
   called to reform. His elder brother, Charles, became a priest at Noyon,
   and died a libertine and an infidel in the same year in which John
   proclaimed his faith to the world (1536)--as if to repeat the startling
   contrast of Esau and Jacob, reprobation and election, from the same
   womb. [791] Another remarkable coincidence is the fact that the
   Reformer studied scholastic philosophy under the same Spanish
   instructor of the College de Montaigu at Paris in which a few years
   afterwards Ignatius Loyola, the famous founder of Jesuitism--the very
   opposite pole of Calvinism--laid the foundation of his
   counter-reformation. [792]

   Calvin received the best education which France could afford, in the
   Universities of Orleans, Bourges, and Paris, first for the priesthood,
   then, at the request of his father, for the law. [793] He early
   distinguished himself by excessive industry, which undermined his
   constitution, severe self-discipline, and a certain censoriousness, for
   which he was called by his fellow-students 'the Accusative Case.' [794]
   He made rapid progress. Even as a student of nineteen he was often
   called to the chair of an absent professor, so that (as Beza says) he
   was considered a doctor rather than an auditor. When he left the
   university he was the most promising literary man of the age. He might
   have attained the highest position in France, had not his religious
   convictions undergone a radical change.

   Protestant ideas were then pervading the atmosphere and agitating the
   educated classes of France even at the court, which was divided on the
   question of religion. Two of Calvin's teachers, Cordier (or Corderius,
   who afterwards followed him to Geneva) and Wolmar, were friendly to
   reform, and one of his relatives, Olivétan, became soon afterwards
   (1534) the first Protestant translator of the Bible into French. He
   seems, however, to have exerted as much influence on them as they
   exerted on him. [795]

   His first work was a commentary on Seneca's book on Mercy, which he
   published at his own expense, April, 1532. [796] It moves in the circle
   of classical philology and moral philosophy, and reveals a
   characteristic love for the nobler type of Stoicism, great familiarity
   with Greek and Roman literature, masterly Latinity, rare exegetical
   skill, clear and sound judgment, and a keen insight into the evils of
   despotism and the defects of the courts of justice, but makes no
   allusion to Christianity. Hence it is quite improbable that it was an
   indirect plea for toleration and clemency intended to operate on the
   King of France in dealing with his Protestant subjects. [797] His
   earliest letters, from 1530 to 1532, are likewise silent on religious
   subjects, and refer to humanistic studies, and matters of friendship
   and business. [798]

   His conversion to the cause of the Reformation seems to have taken
   place in the latter part of 1532, about one year after the death of
   Zwingli. [799] The precise date and circumstances are unknown. It was
   as he himself characterizes it, a sudden change (subita conversio) from
   Papal superstition to the evangelical faith, yet not without previous
   struggles. He tenaciously adhered to the Catholic Church until he was
   able to disconnect the true idea and invisible essence of the Church
   from its outward organization. Like Luther, he strove in vain to attain
   peace of conscience by the methods of Romanism, and was driven to a
   deeper sense of sin and guilt. 'Only one haven of salvation is left for
   our souls,' he says, 'and that is the mercy of God in Christ. We are
   saved by grace--not by our merits, not by our works.' After deep and
   earnest study of the Scriptures, the knowledge of the truth, like a
   bright light from heaven, burst upon his mind with such force that
   there was nothing left for him but to abjure his sins and errors, and
   to obey the will of God. He consulted not with flesh and blood, and
   burned the bridge after him. [800]

   There never was a change of conviction purer in motive, more radical in
   character, more fruitful and permanent in result. It bears a striking
   resemblance to that still greater event near Damascus, which
   transformed a fanatical Pharisee into an apostle of Jesus Christ. And
   indeed Calvin was not unlike St. Paul in his intellectual and moral
   constitution; and the apostle of sovereign grace and evangelical
   freedom never had a more sympathetic expounder than the Reformer of
   Geneva.

   With this step Calvin renounced all prospects of a brilliant career,
   upon which he had already entered, and exposed himself to the danger of
   persecution and death. [801] Though naturally bashful and retiring, and
   seeking one quiet hiding-place after another, he was forced to come
   forward. He exhorted and strengthened the timid believers, usually
   closing with the words of St. Paul: 'If God be for us, who can be
   against us?' There is no evidence that he ever was ordained by human
   hands to the ministry of the gospel; but he had an extraordinary call,
   like that of the prophets of old, and the Apostle of the Gentiles. This
   was felt by his brethren, and about a year after his conversion he was
   the acknowledged leader of the Protestant party in France.

   For awhile matters seemed to take a favorable turn at the court. His
   friend, Nicholas Cop, a learned physician, was even elected Rector of
   the University of Paris. [802] At his request Calvin prepared for him
   an inaugural address on Christian philosophy, which Cop delivered on
   All-Saints' Day, in 1533, in the Church of the Mathurins, before a
   large assembly. He embraced this public occasion to advocate the reform
   of the Church on the basis of the pure gospel. [803] Such a provocation
   Catholic France had never before received. The Sorbonne ordered the
   address to be burned. Cop was warned, and fled to Basle; Calvin--as
   tradition says--escaped in a basket from a window, and left Paris in
   the garb of a vine-dresser, scarcely knowing whither he was going. A
   few months afterwards the king himself took a decided stand against the
   Reformation, and between Nov. 10, 1534, and May 3, 1535, twenty-four
   Protestants were burned alive in Paris, while many more were condemned
   to less cruel sufferings. [804]

   For more than two years Calvin wandered a fugitive evangelist, under
   assumed names, from place to place. We find him at Angonlême with his
   learned friend, the young canon Louis du Tillet, using his excellent
   library, and probably preparing his 'Institutes;' then at the court of
   Queen Margaret of Navarre, the sister of Francis I., where he met Le
   Fèvre d'Estaples (Faber Stapulensis), the aged patriarch of French
   Protestantism, and Gérard Roussel, her chaplain, who advised him 'to
   purify the house of God, but not to destroy it;' at Noyon (May, 1534),
   where he parted with his ecclesiastical benefices; at Poictiers, where
   he celebrated, with a few friends, for the first time, the Lord's
   Supper according to the evangelical rite, in a cave near the town,
   called to this day 'Calvin's Cave;' at Orleans, where he published his
   first theological work, a tract against the Anabaptist doctrine of the
   sleep of the soul between death and the resurrection, using exclusively
   Scriptural arguments with rare exegetical and polemical skill; [805]
   again (towards the close of 1534) at Paris, where he met for the first
   time the unfortunate Michael Servetus, and challenged him to a
   disputation on the Trinity. But the persecution then breaking out
   against the Protestants forced him to forsake the soil of France. With
   his friend Du Tillet he fled to Strasburg, where he arrived utterly
   destitute, having been robbed by an unfaithful servant, and formed an
   intimate friendship with Bucer. Thence he went to Basle, where he
   quietly studied Hebrew with Capito and Grynæus, and published the first
   edition of his 'Institutes' (1536). In the spring of 1536 he spent a
   short time at the court of the Duchess Renée of Ferrara, the daughter
   of Louis XII., a little, deformed, but highly intelligent, noble, and
   pious lady, who gathered around her a circle of friends of the
   Reformation, and continued to correspond with him as her guide of
   conscience. [806] Returning from Italy, where he was threatened by the
   Inquisition, [807] he paid a flying visit to Noyon, and had the
   pleasure to gain his only remaining younger brother Anthony and his
   sister Mary to the Reformed faith. With them he proceeded to
   Switzerland, intending to settle at Basle or Strasburg, and to lead the
   quiet life of a scholar and an author, without the slightest
   inclination to a public career. But God had decreed otherwise.

   Passing through Geneva in August, 1536, where he expected to spend only
   a night, Calvin was held fast by William Farel, the fearless
   evangelist, who threatened him with the curse of God if he preferred
   his studies to the work of the Lord. 'These words,' says Calvin (in the
   Preface to his Commentary on the Psalms), 'terrified and shook me, as
   if God from on high had stretched out his hand to stop me, so that I
   renounced the journey which I had undertaken.' [808] Farel, a French
   nobleman, twenty years older than Calvin, and like him driven by
   persecution to Switzerland, where he destroyed the strongholds of
   idolatry with the zeal of a prophet, did a great work when 'he gave
   Geneva to the Reformation,' but a still greater one when 'he gave
   Calvin to Geneva.'

   This was the turning-point in Calvin's life. Once resolved to obey the
   voice from heaven, the timid and delicate youth shrunk from no danger.
   Geneva was then a city of only twelve or fifteen thousand inhabitants,
   but within its narrow limits it was to become 'the scene of every
   crisis and every problem, great or small, which can agitate human
   society.' [809] It then represented 'a tottering republic, a wavering
   faith, a nascent Church.' Calvin felt that a negative state of freedom
   from the tyranny of Savoy and Popery was far worse than Popery itself,
   and that positive faith and order alone could save the city from
   political and religious anarchy. He insisted on the abolition of
   immoral habits, the adoption of an evangelical confession of faith and
   catechism, the introduction of a strict discipline, Psalm singing, and
   monthly celebration of the Lord's Supper, with the right of excluding
   unworthy communicants. [810]

   The magistrate refused to comply, and forbade Calvin and Farel the
   pulpit; but they, preferring to obey God rather than men, preached at
   Easter, 1538, to an armed crowd, and declared their determination not
   to administer the holy communion, lest it be desecrated. On the
   following day they were deposed and expelled from the city by the great
   Council of the Two Hundred.

   Calvin, again an exile, though now for the principle of authority and
   discipline rather than doctrine, spent three quiet and fruitful years
   (1538-41) with Bucer at Strasburg, as teacher of theology and preacher
   to a congregation of several hundred French refugees. [811] Here he
   became acquainted with the German Reformation, for Strasburg was the
   connecting link between Germany and France, as also between Lutheranism
   and Zwinglianism. But he was disagreeably impressed with the want of
   Church discipline, and the slavish dependence of the German clergy on
   the secular rulers. His French congregation was admired for its
   activity and order. In Strasburg he wrote his tract on the Lord's
   Supper, his Commentary on the Romans, his masterly answer to Cardinal
   Sadolet's letter to the Genevese, and his revision of Olivétan's French
   translation of the Bible. Some of these books attracted the favorable
   notice of Luther, whom he never met in this world, but always esteemed,
   with a full knowledge of his faults, as one of the greatest servants of
   Christ. [812]

   In September, 1540, he married Idelette de Bure (a little town in
   Gueldres), a grave, pious, modest, amiable, and cultivated widow, with
   three children, whose first husband he had converted from Anabaptism to
   the orthodox faith. She was in delicate health, but very devoted to
   him, and satisfied all his desires. He lived with her in perfect
   harmony nine years, and she bore him one child, a son who died in
   infancy. He seldom alludes to her in his correspondence, but always in
   terms of respect and love; and in informing his friend Viret of her
   departure, he calls her 'the best companion, who would cheerfully have
   shared with me exile and poverty, and followed me unto death; during
   her life she was to me a faithful assistant in all my labors; she never
   dissented from my wishes even in the smallest things.' Seven years
   afterwards, in a letter of consolation to a friend (Rev. Richard de
   Valeville, of Frankfort), he says: 'I know from my own experience how
   painful and burning is the wound which the death of thy wife must have
   inflicted upon you. How difficult it was for me to become master of my
   grief. . . . Our chief comfort, after all, is the wonderful providence
   of God, which overrules our affliction for our spiritual benefit, and
   separates us from our beloved only to reunite us in his heavenly
   kingdom.' His grief at her death, and at the death of his child,
   reveals a hidden spring of domestic affection which is rare in men of
   his austerity of character and absorption in public duty. He remained a
   widower the rest of his life. [813]

   From the Strasburg period dates also his intimate friendship with
   Melanchthon, which was not broken by death, and is the more remarkable
   in view of their difference of opinion on the subject of predestination
   and free-will. He met him at religious conferences with Romanists, at
   Frankfort (1539), at Worms (1540), and at Regensburg (Ratisbon, 1541),
   which he attended as delegate from Strasburg. Their correspondence is a
   noble testimony to the mind and heart of these great men, so widely
   different in nationality, constitution, and temper--the one as firm as
   a rock, the other as timid as a child--and yet one in their deepest
   relations to Christ and his salvation. They represent the higher union
   of the Lutheran and Reformed, the Teutonic and the Romanic types of
   Protestantism. This truly Christian friendship was touchingly expressed
   by Calvin a year after the death of the Preceptor of Germany (1561): 'O
   Philip Melanchthon! for it is upon thee that I call, upon thee, who now
   livest with Christ in God, and art there waiting for us, until we shall
   also be gathered with thee to that blessed rest! A hundred times, worn
   out with fatigue and overwhelmed with care, thou didst lay thy head
   upon my breast, and say, "Would to God that I might die here, on thy
   breast!" And I, a thousand times since then, have earnestly desired
   that it had been granted us to be together. Certainly thou wouldst have
   been more valiant to face danger, and stronger to despise hatred, and
   bolder to disregard false accusations. Thus the wickedness of many
   would have been restrained, whose audacity of insult was increased by
   what they called thy weakness.' [814]

   'It would be difficult,' says Guizot, 'to reconcile truth, piety, and
   friendship more tenderly.'

   In the mean time the Genevese had been brought by sad experience to
   repent of the expulsion of the faithful pastors, and to feel that the
   Reformed faith and discipline alone could put their commonwealth on a
   firm and enduring foundation. The magistrate and people united in an
   urgent and repeated recall of Calvin. He reluctantly yielded at last,
   and in September, 1541, after passing a few days with Farel at
   Neufchatel, he made a triumphant entry into the beautiful city on lake
   Leman. [815] The magistracy provided for him a house and garden near
   the Cathedral of St. Pierre, broadcloth for a coat, and, in
   consideration of his generous hospitality to strangers and refugees, an
   annual salary of five hundred florins, [816] twelve measures of wheat,
   and two tubs of wine. The rulers of Strasburg, says Beza, stipulated
   that he should always remain a burgess of their city, and requested him
   to retain the revenues of a prebend which had been assigned as the
   salary of his professorship in theology, but they could not persuade
   him to accept so much as a single farthing.

   This second settlement was final. Geneva was now wedded to Calvin, and
   had to sink or swim with his principles. [817] He continued to labor
   there, without interruption, for twenty-three years, till his death,
   May 27, 1564: fighting a fierce spiritual war against Romanism and
   superstition, but still more against infidelity and immorality;
   establishing a model theocracy on the basis of Moses and Christ;
   preaching and teaching from day to day; writing commentaries,
   theological and polemical treatises; founding an academy, which in the
   first year attracted more than eight hundred students, and flourishes
   to this day; attending the sessions of the consistory and the senate;
   entertaining and counselling strangers from all parts of the world; and
   corresponding in every direction. He was, in fact, the spiritual head
   of the Church and the republic of Geneva, and the leader of the
   Reformed movement throughout Europe. And yet he lived all the time in
   the utmost simplicity. It is reported that Cardinal Sadolet, when
   passing through Geneva incognito, and calling on Calvin, was surprised
   to find him residing, not in an episcopal palace, with a retinue of
   servants, as he expected, but in a little house, himself opening the
   door. The story may not be sufficiently authenticated, but it
   corresponds fully with all we know about his ascetic habits. [818] For
   years he took but one meal a day. [819] He refused an increase of
   salary and presents of every description, except for the poor and the
   refugees, whom he was always ready to aid. He left, besides his
   library, only about two hundred dollars, which he bequeathed to his
   younger brother Anthony and his children. [820] When Pope Pius IV.
   heard of his death, he paid him this high compliment: 'The strength of
   that heretic consisted in this, that money never had the slightest
   charm for him. If I had such servants, my dominions would extend from
   sea to sea.' [821]

   His immense labors and midnight studies, [822] the care of all the
   churches, and bodily infirmities--such as headaches, asthma, fever,
   gravel--gradually wore out his delicate body. He died, in full
   possession of his mental powers, in the prime of manhood and
   usefulness, not quite fifty-five years of age, leaving his Church in
   the best order and in the hands of an able and faithful successor,
   Theodore Beza. Like a patriarch, he assembled first the syndics of
   Geneva, and afterwards the ministers, around his dying bed, thanked
   them for their kindness and devotion, asked humbly their pardon for
   occasional outbursts of violence and wrath, and affected them to tears
   by words of wisdom and counsel to persevere in the pure doctrine and
   discipline of Christ. It was a sublime scene, worthily described by
   Beza, [823] and well represented by a painter's skill. [824]

   The Reformer died with the setting sun. 'Thus,' says Beza, 'God
   withdrew into heaven that most brilliant light, which was a lamp of the
   Church. In the following night and day there was immense grief and
   lamentation in the whole city; for the republic had lost its wisest
   citizen, the Church its faithful shepherd, the academy an incomparable
   teacher--all lamented the departure of their common father and best
   comforter next to God. A multitude of citizens streamed to the
   death-chamber, and could scarcely be separated from the corpse. Among
   them also were several foreigners, as the distinguished English
   embassador to France, who had come to Geneva to make the acquaintance
   of the celebrated man. On the Lord's day, in the afternoon, the remains
   were carried to the common graveyard on Plainpalnis, followed by all
   the patricians, pastors, professors, and teachers, and nearly the whole
   city, in sincere mourning.'

   Calvin expressly forbade the erection of any monument over his grave.
   [825] The stranger asks in vain even for the spot which covers his
   mortal remains in the cemetery of Geneva. Like Moses, he was buried out
   of the reach of idolatry. The Reformed Churches of both hemispheres are
   his monument, more enduring than marble. On the third centenary of his
   death (1864), his friends in Geneva, aided by gifts from foreign lands,
   erected to his memory the Salle de la Réformation--a noble building,
   founded on the principles of the Evangelical Alliance, and dedicated to
   the preaching of the pure gospel and the advocacy of every good cause.

   CALVIN'S PERSONAL CHARACTER.

   Calvin was of middle, or rather small stature (like David and Paul), of
   feeble health, courteous, kind, grave and dignified in deportment. He
   had a meagre and emaciated frame, a thin, pale, finely chiseled face, a
   well-formed mouth, a long, pointed beard, black hair, a prominent nose,
   a lofty forehead, and flaming eyes. He was modest, plain, and
   scrupulously neat in dress, orderly and methodical in all his habits,
   temperate and even abstemious, allowing himself scarcely nourishment
   and sleep enough for vigorous work. His physical tent barely covered
   the mighty spirit within. Conscience and logic, a commanding mind and
   will, shone through the thin veil of mortality. [826]

   How different Luther and Zwingli, with their strong animal foundation,
   and their abundance of flesh and blood! Calvin seemed to be all bone
   and nerve. Beza says he looked in death almost the same as alive in
   sleep. [827]

   His intellectual endowments were of the highest order and thoroughly
   disciplined. He had more constructive, systematizing, and organizing
   genius than any other Reformer, and was better adapted to found a
   solid, compact, and permanent school of theology. He was not a
   speculative or intuitive philosopher, but a consummate logician and
   dialectician. Luther and Zwingli cut the stones from the quarry; Calvin
   gave them shape and polish, and erected a magnificent cathedral of
   ideas with the skill of a master architect. His precocity and
   consistency were marvelous. He did not grow before the public, like
   Luther and Melanchthon, and pass through contradictions and
   retractations, but when a mere youth of twenty-six he appeared fully
   armed, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter, and never changed his
   views on doctrine or discipline. He had an extraordinary and
   well-stored memory, a profound, acute, and penetrating intellect, a
   clear, sound, and almost unerring judgment, a perfect mastery over the
   Latin and French tongues. His Latin is as easy and elegant, and
   certainly as nervous and forcible, as Cicero's, yet free from the
   pedantic and affected purism of a Bembo and Castalio. [828] He is one
   of the fathers of modern French, as Luther is the father of modern
   German. His eloquence is logic set on fire by intense conviction. His
   Preface to the 'Institutes,' addressed to the King of France, is
   reckoned as one of the three immortal prefaces in literature (to which
   only that of President De Thou to his French History and that of
   Casaubon to Polybius can be compared); and his 'Institutes' themselves,
   as has been well said, are 'in truth a continuous oration, in which the
   stream of discussion rolls onward with an impetuous current, yet always
   keeps within its defined channel.' [829]

   He surpassed all other Reformers (except Beza) in classical culture and
   social refinement. He was a patrician by education and taste, and felt
   more at ease among scholars and men of high rank than among the common
   people. Yet he was quite free from aristocratic pride, despised all
   ostentation and display, and esteemed every man according to his real
   worth.

   History furnishes, perhaps, no example of a man who with so little
   personal popularity had such influence upon the people, and who with
   such natural timidity and bashfulness combined such strength and
   control over his age and future generations. Constitutionally a
   retiring scholar and a man of thought, he became providentially a
   mighty man of action and an organizer of churches.

   His moral and religious character is impressed with a certain majesty
   which keeps the admirer at a respectful distance. [830] He has often
   been compared to an old Roman Censor or Stoic; but he resembles much
   more a Hebrew Prophet. Severe against others, he was far more severe
   against himself, and was always guided by a sense of duty. Fear of God,
   purity of motive, spotless integrity, single devotion to truth and
   duty, unswerving fidelity, sincere humility are the prominent traits of
   his character. Soaring high above the earth, he was absorbed in
   God--who alone is great--and looked down upon man as a fleeting shadow.
   The glory of the Lord and the reformation of the Church constituted the
   single passion of his life. His appropriate symbol was a hand offering
   the sacrifice of a bleeding heart to God. [831]

   It must be admitted that this kind of greatness, while it commands our
   admiration and respect, does not of itself secure our affection and
   love. There is a censoriousness and austerity about Calvin and his
   creed which repelled many good men, even among his contemporaries.
   [832] He looked more to the holiness than to the love of God. His piety
   bears more the stamp of the Old Testament than that of the New. He
   represents the majesty and severity of the law rather than the
   sweetness and loveliness of the gospel, the obedience of a servant of
   Jehovah rather than the joyfulness of a child of our heavenly Father.

   Yet even this must be qualified. He sympathized with the spirit of
   David and Paul as much as with the spirit of Moses and Elijah, and had
   the strongest sense of the freedom of the gospel salvation. Moreover,
   behind his cold marble frame there was beating a noble, loving, and
   faithful heart, which attracted and retained to the last the friendship
   of such eminent servants of God as Farel, Viret, Beza, Bucer,
   Bullinger, Knox, and Melanchthon. 'He obtained,' says Guizot, 'the
   devoted affection of the best men and the esteem of all, without ever
   seeking to please them.' [833] John Knox, his senior in years, sat at
   his feet as a humble pupil, and esteemed him the greatest man after the
   Apostles. Farel, in his old age, hastened on foot from Neufchatel to
   Geneva to take leave of his sick friend, and desired to die in his
   place. Beza, who lived sixteen years on terms of personal intimacy with
   him, revered and loved him as a father. And even Melanchthon wished to
   repose and to die on his bosom. His familiar correspondence shows him
   in the most favorable light, and is a sufficient refutation of all the
   calumnies and slanders of his enemies.

   He lacked the good-nature, the genial humor, the German Gemüthlichkeit,
   the overflowing humanity of Luther, who for this reason will always be
   more popular with the masses; but he surpassed him in culture,
   refinement, consistency, and moral self-control. Both were equally
   unselfish and unworldly. Both were headstrong and will-strong; but
   Calvin was more open to argument and less obstinate. Both had, like St.
   Paul, a fiery and violent temper, which was the propelling force in
   their hard work, and in fierce battles with the pope and the devil.
   Hegel says somewhere that 'nothing great can be done without passion.'
   [834] It is only men of intense convictions and fearless courage that
   make deep and lasting impressions upon others. But temper is a force of
   nature, which must be controlled by reason and regulated by justice and
   charity. Luther came down like a thunder-storm upon his opponents, and
   used the crushing sledge-hammer indiscriminately against Eck, Cochlæus,
   Henry VIII., Erasmus, the Sacramentarians, and Zwinglians; while Calvin
   wielded the sharp sword of irony, wit, scorn, and contempt in defense
   of truth, but never from personal hatred and revenge. 'Even a dog
   barks,' he says, 'when his master is attacked; how could I be silent
   when the honor of my Lord is assailed?' [835] He confessed, however, in
   a letter to Bucer, and on his death-bed, that he found it difficult to
   tame 'the wild beast' of his wrath, and humbly asked forgiveness for
   his weakness. He had no children to write to, and to play with around
   the Christmas-tree, like Luther, but he appears to better advantage in
   his relations with men and women. He treated them, even the much
   younger Beza, as equals, overlooked minor differences, and in
   correcting their faults expected the same manly frankness from them in
   return; while Luther, growing more irritable and overbearing with
   advancing years, made even Melanchthon tremble and fear. But we should
   charitably remember that the faults of these truly great and good men
   were only the long shadows of their extraordinary virtues. [836]

   It may be found strange that Calvin never alludes to the paradise of
   nature by which he was surrounded on the lovely shores of Lake Leman,
   in sight of the lofty Alps that pierce the skies in silent adoration of
   their Maker. But we look in vain for descriptions of natural scenery in
   the whole literature of the sixteenth century; and the proper
   appreciation of the beauties of Switzerland, as well as of other
   countries, is of more recent date. Calvin had no special organ nor time
   for the enjoyment of the beautiful either in nature or in art, but he
   appreciated poetry and music. [837] He insisted on the introduction of
   congregational singing in Geneva, and wrote himself a few poetic
   versions of the Psalms, and a hymn of praise to Christ, which are
   worthy of Clement Marot and reveal an unexpected vein of poetic fervor
   and tenderness. [838] The following specimen must suffice:


   'I greet thee, who my sure Redeemer art,

   My only trust, and Saviour of my heart!

   Who so much toil and woe

   And pain didst undergo,

   For my poor, worthless sake:

   We pray thee, from our hearts,

   All idle griefs and smarts

   And foolish cares to take.

   'Thou art the true and perfect gentleness,

   No harshness hast thou, and no bitterness:

   Make us to taste and prove,

   Make us adore and love,

   The sweet grace found in thee;

   With longing to abide

   Ever at thy dear side,

   In thy sweet unity.

   'Poor, banished exiles, wretched sons of Eve,

   Full of all sorrows, unto thee we grieve;

   To thee we bring our sighs,

   Our groanings, and our cries:

   Thy pity, Lord, we crave;

   We take the sinner's place,

   And pray thee, of thy grace,

   To pardon and to save.'

   TRIBUTES TO CALVIN.

   I add some estimates of Calvin's character, which represent very
   different stand-points. [839]

   Beza, who knew Calvin best and watched at his death-bed, concludes his
   biography with these words:

   'Having been an observer of Calvin's life for sixteen years, I may with
   perfect right testify that we have in this man a most beautiful example
   of a truly Christian life and death, which it is easy to calumniate but
   difficult to imitate.' [840]

   Bungener, a pastor of the national Church of Geneva, and author of
   several historical works, says: [841]

   'Let us not give him praise which he would not have accepted. God alone
   creates; a man is great only because God thinks fit to accomplish great
   things by his instrumentality. Never did any great man understand this
   better than Calvin. It cost him no effort to refer all the glory to
   God; nothing indicates that he was ever tempted to appropriate to
   himself the smallest portion of it. Luther, in many a passage,
   complacently dwells on the thought that a petty monk, as he says, has
   so well made the Pope to tremble, and so well stirred the whole world.
   Calvin will never say any such thing; he never even seems to say it,
   even in the deepest recesses of his heart: every where you perceive the
   man, who applies to all things--to the smallest as to the greatest--the
   idea that it is God who does all and is all. Read again, from this
   point of view, the very pages in which he appeared to you the
   haughtiest and most despotic, and see if, even there, he is any thing
   other than the workman referring all, and in all sincerity, to his
   Master. . . . But the man, in spite of all his faults, has not the less
   remained one of the fairest types of faith, of earnest piety, of
   devotedness, and of courage. Amid modern laxity, there is no character
   of whom the contemplation is more instructive; for there is no man of
   whom it has been said with greater justice, in the words of an apostle,
   "he endured as seeing him who is invisible."'

   Jules Michelet, the French historian, remarks: [842]

   'Among the martyrs, with whom Calvin constantly conversed in spirit, he
   became a martyr himself; he felt and lived like a man before whom the
   whole earth disappears, and who tunes his last Psalm, his whole eye
   fixed upon the eye of God, because he knows that on the following
   morning he may have to ascend the stake.'

   Ernest Renan, once educated for the Romish priesthood, then a skeptic,
   with all his abhorrence of Calvin's creed, pays the following striking
   tribute to his character: [843]

   Calvin was one of those absolute men, cast complete in one mould, who
   is taken in wholly at a single glance: one letter, one action suffices
   for a judgment of him. There were no folds in that inflexible soul,
   which never knew doubt or hesitation. . . . Careless of wealth, of
   titles, of honors, indifferent to pomp, modest in his life, apparently
   humble, sacrificing every thing to the desire of making others like
   himself, I hardly know of a man, save Ignatius Loyola, who could match
   him in these terrible transports. . . . It is surprising that a man who
   appears to us in his life and writings so unsympathetic should have
   been the centre of an immense movement in his generation, and that this
   harsh and severe tone should have exerted so great an influence on the
   minds of his contemporaries. How was it, for example, that one of the
   most distinguished women of her time, Renée of France, in her court at
   Ferrara, surrounded by the flower of European wits, was captivated by
   that stern master, and by him drawn into a course that must have been
   so thickly strewn with thorns? This kind of austere seduction is
   exercised by those only who work with real conviction. Lacking that
   vivid, deep, sympathetic ardor which was one of the secrets of Luther's
   success, lacking the charm, the perilous, languishing tenderness of
   Francis of Sales, Calvin succeeded, in an age and in a country which
   called for a reaction towards Christianity, simply because he was the
   most christian man of his generation.'

   Guizot, a very competent judge of historical and moral greatness, thus
   concludes his biography: [844]

   'Calvin is great by reason of his marvelous powers, his lasting labors,
   and the moral height and purity of his character. . . . Earnest in
   faith, pure in motive, austere in his life, and mighty in his works,
   Calvin is one of those who deserve their great fame. Three centuries
   separate us from him, but it is impossible to examine his character and
   history without feeling, if not affection and sympathy, at least
   profound respect and admiration for one of the great Reformers of
   Europe and of the great Christians of France.'

   Prof. Kahnis, of Leipzig, whose personal and theological sympathies are
   with Luther, nevertheless asserts the moral superiority of Calvin above
   the other Reformers: [845]

   'The fear of God was the soul of his piety, the rock-like certainty of
   his election before the foundation of the world was his power, and the
   doing of the will of God his single aim, which he pursued with
   trembling and fear. . . . No other Reformer has so well demonstrated
   the truth of Christ's word that, in the kingdom of God, dominion is
   service. No other had such an energy of self-sacrifice, such an
   irrefragable conscientiousness in the greatest as well as the smallest
   things, such a disciplined power. This man, whose dying body was only
   held together by the will flaming from his eyes, had a majesty of
   character which commanded the veneration of his contemporaries.'

   Prof. Dorner, of Berlin, the first among the theologians of the age,
   distinguished by profound learning, penetrating thought, rare
   catholicity of spirit, and nice sense of justice and discrimination,
   says:

   'Calvin was equally great in intellect and character, lovely in social
   life, full of tender sympathy and faithfulness to friends, yielding and
   forgiving towards personal offenses, but inexorably severe when he saw
   the honor of God obstinately and malignantly attacked. He combined
   French fire and practical good sense with German depth and soberness.
   He moved as freely in the world of ideas as in the business of Church
   government. He was an architectonic genius in science and practical
   life, always with an eye to the holiness and majesty of God.' [846]

   Prof. Gr. T. Fisher, of Yale College, New Haven, gives the following
   fair and impartial estimate of Calvin: [847]

   'When we look at his extraordinary intellect, at his culture--which
   opponents, like Bossuet, have been forced to commend--at the invincible
   energy which made him endure with more than stoical fortitude
   infirmities of body under which most men would have sank, and to
   perform, in the midst of them, an incredible amount of mental labor;
   when we see him, a scholar naturally fond of seclusion, physically
   timid, and recoiling from notoriety and strife, abjuring the career
   that was most to his taste, and plunging, with a single-hearted,
   disinterested zeal and an indomitable will, into a hard, protracted
   contest; and when we follow his steps, and see what things he effected,
   we can not deny him the attributes of greatness. . . . His last days
   were of a piece with his life. His whole course has been compared by
   Vinet to the growth of one rind of a tree from another, or to a chain
   of logical sequences, He was endued with a marvelous power of
   understanding, although the imagination and sentiments were less
   roundly developed. His systematic spirit fitted him to be the founder
   of an enduring school of thought. In this characteristic he may be
   compared with Aquinas. He has been appropriately styled the Aristotle
   of the Reformation. He was a perfectly honest man. He subjected his
   will to the eternal rule of right, as far as he could discover it. His
   motives were pure. He felt that God was near him, and sacrificed every
   thing to obey the direction of Providence. The fear of God ruled in his
   soul; not a slavish fear, but a principle such as animated the prophets
   of the Old Covenant. The combination of his qualities was such that he
   could not fail to attract profound admiration and reverence from one
   class of minds, and excite intense antipathy in another. There is no
   one of the Reformers who is spoken of, at this late day, with so much
   personal feeling, either of regard or aversion. But whoever studies his
   life and writings, especially the few passages in which he lets us into
   his confidence and appears to invite our sympathy, will acquire a
   growing sense of his intellectual and moral greatness, and a tender
   consideration for his errors.'

   [790] The Latinized form of the French Chauvin or Cauvin. He sunk, even
   in name, his nationality in his catholicity.

   [791] Guizot (pp. 153, 155): 'Evidently Charles Calvin lived and died a
   dissolute man and an unbeliever, and at the same time remained chaplain
   of the Catholic church of his native town. The sixteenth century
   abounds in similar instances. . . . The same thing was going on every
   where; unbelievers and fervent Christians, libertines and men of the
   most austere lives, were springing up and living side by side. Two
   contrary winds were blowing over Europe at that period, one carrying
   with it skepticism and licentiousness, while the other breathed only
   Christian faith and the severest morality. One of these arose chiefly
   from the revival of the ancient literature and philosophy of Greece and
   Rome; the other sprang from the struggles made in the Church itself,
   and in its councils, to arrive at a reform which was at the same time
   greatly desired and fiercely opposed. . . . It was, in short, the age
   which produced Erasmus and Luther in Germany, and Montaigne and Calvin
   in France.' Merle d'Aubigné (Vol. V. p. 455) conjectures that Charles
   Calvin became a convert to Protestantism on his death-bed, for which
   the infuriated priests had him buried by night between the four pillars
   of a gibbet.

   [792] Kampschulte, Vol. I. p. 223.

   [793] It seems (according to Jacques Le Vasseur, 1.c. 1153 sqq., as
   quoted by Kampschulte, Vol. I. p. 226) that Gerard Chauvin became
   involved in difficulty with his ecclesiastical superiors, and was even
   excommunicated. Kampschulte conjectures that this was probably the
   reason why he ordered his son to exchange the study of theology for
   that of law. But Calvin himself (in his Commentary on the Psalms)
   assigns a different motive: 'Mon père m'avoit destiné à la Théologie;
   mais puis après, d'autant qu'il considéroit que la science des Loix
   communément enrichit ceux qui la suyvent, ceste espérance luy fait
   incontinent changer d'avis.' The study of the law was of great use to
   Calvin in the organization and control of Church and State in Geneva.

   [794] A notice of Jacques Le Vasseur, which agrees with Beza's
   statement that he was 'tenera ætate mirum in modum religiosus' and
   'severus omnium in suis sodalibus vitiorum censor.'

   [795] According to Beza and Stähelin (Vol. I. p. 88), Calvin took part
   even in the first edition of Olivétan's French New Testament (1534).
   But this seems to be an error; see Reuss, Révue de Theologie, 1866, No.
   III. p. 318, and Kampschulte, p. 247. He revised, however, the second
   edition, which included the Old Testament (1535), and wrote the preface
   (see Stähelin, pp.89 sq.).

   [796] 'L. Annei Se- | necæ, Romani Senato- | ris, ac philosophi
   clarissi- | mi, libri duo de Clementia, ad Ne- | ronem Cæsarem: |
   Joannis Calvini Noviodunæi commentariis illustrati. | Parisiis . . .
   1532.' Reprinted from the ed. princeps in the new edition of the Opera,
   Vol. V. (1866), pp. 6-162. The commentary is preceded by a dedicatory
   epistle, and a sketch of the life of Seneca.

   [797] As is asserted by Henry, Herzog, Dorner (p. 375), and also by
   Guizot (p. 162), but justly denied by Stähelin (Vol. I. pp. 14 sqq.)
   and Kampschulte (p. 238). The work is not dedicated to Francis I., but
   to Claude de Hangest, the Abbot of St. Eloy (Eligius), afterwards
   Bishop of Noyon, his former schoolmate; and the implied comparison of
   the French king with Nero, and the incidental mention of the Neronian
   persecution ('quum Nero diris suppliciis impotenter sæviret in
   Christianos,' Opera, Vol. V. p. 10), would have been fatal to such an
   apologetic aim. Calvin sent a copy to 'Erasmus, and called him 'the
   honor and the chief delight of the world of letters'--literarum alterum
   decus ac primæ deliciæ (see his letter to Claude de Hangest, April 4,
   1532, in Herminjard, Tom. II. p. 411).

   [798] They were recently brought to light by Jules Bonnet and
   Herminjard. They are chiefly addressed to his fellow-student, Francis
   Daniel, an advocate of Orleans, who acknowledged the necessity of the
   Reformation, but remained in the Church of Rome. See the Edinburgh
   edition of Calvin's Letters, by Bonnet, Vol. I. p. 3; Herminjard, Vol.
   II. pp. 278 sqq.; and Opera, Vol. X. Pt. II. pp. 3 sqq. His first
   letter to Daniel is dated 'Melliani (i.e. Meillant, south of Bourges,
   not Meaux, as the Edinburgh edition misunderstands it), 8 Idus
   Septembr.,' and is put by Herminjard and the Strasburg editors in the
   year 1530 (not 1529).

   [799] Stähelin puts his conversion in the year 1533 (Vol. I. p. 21).
   But we have a familiar letter from Calvin to Martin Bucer, dated Noyon,
   'pridie nonas Septembres,' probably of the year 1532, in which he
   recommends a French refugee, falsely accused of holding the opinions of
   the Anabaptists, and says: 'I entreat of you, Master Bucer, if my
   prayers, if my tears are of any avail, that you would compassionate and
   help him in his wretchedness. The poor is left in a special manner to
   your care--you are the helper of the orphan. . . . Most learned Sir,
   farewell; Thine from my heart (Tuus ex animo): Calvin' (J. Bonnet's
   Letters, Vol. I. pp. 9-11; the Latin in Opera, Vol. X. Pt. II. p. 24).
   Kampschulte (Vol. I. p. 231) infers even an earlier acquaintance of
   Calvin with Bucer, from a letter of Bucer to Farel, May 1, 1528, in
   which he mentions a juvenis Noviodunensis studying Greek and Hebrew in
   Strasburg (Herminjard, Vol. II. p. 131, and Opera, Vol. X. Pt. II. p.
   1); but this youth was probably his relative Olivétan, who was likewise
   a native of Noyon (Herminjard, Vol. II. p. 451). Besides, there were
   several places in France of the name Noviodunum. In a letter of Oct.,
   1533, to Francis Daniel (Bonnet, Vol. I. p. 12, and Opera, Vol. X. Pt.
   II. p. 27), Calvin first speaks openly of the Reformation in Paris, the
   rage of the Sorbonne, and the satirical comedy against the Queen of
   Navarre.

   [800] He alludes to his conversion only twice, and briefly, namely, in
   the remarkable Preface to his Commentary on the Psalms, and in his
   answer to Cardinal Sadolet (Opera, Vol. V. pp. 389-411 sq.). In the
   latter he describes his mental conflicts and terrors of conscience.

   [801] He says (Ad Sadoleti Epistolam, Opera, Vol. V. p. 389) that if he
   had consulted his personal interest he would never have left the Roman
   Church, where the way to honor would have been very easy to him. Audin,
   in tracing Calvin's conversion to wounded ambition, exposes (as
   Kampschulte justly observes, p. 242) his utter ignorance of Calvin's
   character, whose only ambition was to serve God most faithfully.

   [802] Bulæus, Historia universitatis Parisiensis, Vol. VI. p. 238;
   Kampschulte, Vol. I. p. 243.

   [803] The incomplete draft of this address has recently been discovered
   by J. Bonnet among the manuscripts of the Geneva library. In it Calvin
   explains the great difference between the law and the gospel, and
   charged the Sophists, as he called the scholastic theologians, Nihil de
   fide, nihil de amore Dei, nihil de remissione peccatorum, nihil de
   gratia, nihil de justificatione, nihil de veris operibus disserunt; aut
   si certe disserunt, omnia calumniantur, omnia labefactant, omnia suis
   legibus, hoc est sophisticis coërcent. Vos rogo, quotquot hic adestis,
   ut has hæreses, has in Deum contumelias numquam æquo animo feratis.'
   See Kampschulte, p. 244.

   [804] This is recorded with some satisfaction by a Catholic writer in
   the Journal du Bourgeois de Paris, quoted by Guizot, p. 168. That
   Francis I. was present at these horrible executions is denied by
   Michelet, Martin, and Guizot.

   [805] Psychopannychia, in Opera, Vol. V. pp. 165-232. The Preface is
   dated 'Aureliæ, 1534.' The second edition appeared in Basle, 1535. This
   work forms a contrast to his commentary on Seneca as great as exists
   between the classics and the Bible. In matters relating to the future
   world. Calvin allows no weight to reason and philosophy, but only to
   the Word of God. On the merits of this book, see Stähelin, Vol. I. pp.
   36 sqq.

   [806] Guizot, speaking at some length of this correspondence, makes the
   remark (p. 207): 'I do not hesitate to affirm that the great Catholic
   bishops, who in the seventeenth century directed the consciences of the
   mightiest men in France, did not fulfill the difficult task with more
   Christian firmness, intelligent justice, and knowledge of the world
   than Calvin displayed in his intercourse with the Duchess of Ferrara.
   And the Duchess was not the only person towards whom he fulfilled this
   duty of a Christian pastor. His correspondence shows that he exercised
   a similar influence, in a spirit equally lofty and judicious, over the
   consciences of many Protestants.'

   [807] He took the route of Aosta and the Great St. Bernard. His short
   labors and persecution in Aosta were, five years later (1541),
   commemorated by a monumental cross and inscription--'Calvini
   fuga'--which was restored in 1741, and again in 1841, and stands to
   this day. See Gaberel, Vol. I. p. 100; Stähelin, Vol. I. p. 110;
   Guizot, p. 209: and Merle d'Aubigné, Vol. V. p. 454.

   [808] According to Beza (Vita), Farel used these words: 'At ego tibi
   studia, prætexenti denuntio, omnipotentis Dei nomine, futurum, ut, nisi
   in opus istud Domini nobiscum incumbas, tibi non tam Christum quam te
   ipsum quærenti Dominus maledicat.' Beza adds that Calvin was 'territus
   hac terribili denuntiatione.' Merle d'Aubigné gives a very dramatic
   account of this scene, Vol. V. pp. 456 sqq.

   Opera, Vol. X. Pt. I. pp. 5-14. See a summary in Kampschulte, Vol. I.
   pp. 287 sqq.

   [811] Guizot says fifteen hundred. On Calvin's life and labors in
   Strasburg, see especially the full accounts of Stähelin, Vol. I. pp.
   168-318, and Kampschulte, Vol. I. pp. 320-368.

   [812] Luther wrote to Bucer: 'Greet Calvin, whose little works I have
   read with remarkable pleasure;' and Melanchthon wrote: 'Calvin is in
   high favor here (magnam gratiam iniit).' See. Calvin to Farel, Dec. 12,
   1539; Stähelin, Vol. I. p. 226; and De Wette's edition of Luther's
   Letters, Vol. V. p. 210. Calvin wrote to Bullinger, when the latter was
   provoked by the last rude assault of Luther upon the Zwinglians (1544):
   'I implore you never to forget how great a man Luther is, and by what
   extraordinary gifts he excels. Think with what courage, what constancy,
   what power and success he has devoted himself to this day to the
   overthrow of the reign of Antichrist and the spreading of the doctrine
   of salvation far and near. As for me, I have often said, and I say it
   again, though he should call me a devil, I would still give him due
   honor, and recognize him, in spite of the great faults which obscure
   his extraordinary virtues, as a mighty servant of the Lord.' See Henry,
   Vol. II. p. 351; Stähelin, Vol. I. p. 204; Guizot, p. 243; Opera, Vol.
   XI. p. 774.

   Bonnet, in the fourth volume of the Bulletin pour l'histoire du

   [814] This passage occurs on the first page of his book against the
   fanatical Lutheran, Heshusius (Opera, Vol. IX. p. 461): 'O Philippe
   Melanchthon! Te enim appello, qui apud Deum cum Christo vivis, nosque
   illic expectas, donec tecum in beatam quietem colligamur. Dixisti
   centies, quum fessus laboribus et molestiis oppressus caput
   familiariter in sinum meum deponeres: Utinam, utinam moriar in hoc
   sinu. Ego vero millies postea optavi nobis contingere, ut simul
   essemus. Certe animosior fuisses ad obeunda certamina, et ad spernendam
   invidiam, falsasque criminationes pro nihilo ducendas fortior. Hoc
   quoque modo cohibita fuisset multorum improbitas, quibus ex tua
   mollitie, quam vocabant, crevit insultandi audacia.' Comp. on the
   relation of Calvin to Melanchthon, the full discussion of Stähelin,
   Vol. I. pp. 230-254; also Guizot, p. 246.

   [815] The date is variously given--Sept. 10 by Roget, Sept. 12 by
   Guizot, Sept. 13 by Kampschulte (following Beza).

   [816] 'Worth about 3600 francs, or £150 at the present time.'--Guizot,
   p. 257. A syndic received only one fifth of this sum; but Calvin's
   house was a home for poor refugees of faith from France and other
   lands, the widows and orphans of martyrs, so that he had often not a
   penny left. See Stähelin, Vol. II. p. 391, and Hagenbach, Kirchengesch.
   Vol. III. p. 581.

   [817] Well says Kampschulte (Vol. I. pp. 385 sq.): 'Genf war im Herbst
   1541 den geistlichen Tendenzen Calvins dienstbar geworden, es war an
   den Siegeswagen des Reformators gefesselt und musste ihm folgen trotz
   allen Sträubens, trotz aller Auflehnungsversuche, die später nicht
   ausgeblieben sind. Nicht anders fasste Calvin selbst seine Stellung von
   vorne herein auf. Für ihn ergab sich sein Herrscherrecht über Genf aus
   dem wunderbaren Gange der letzten Ereignisse mit der Zweifellosigkeit
   eines von Gott selbst erklärten Glaubenssatzes. Schimpflich vor drei
   Jahren vertrieben, sah er sich mit den grössten Ehren auf den
   Schauplatz zurückgeführt, den ihm Farel einst in ernster Stunde "im
   Namen des allmächtigen Gottes" angewiesen: mit Jubel wurde er von
   demselben Volke begrüsst, das ihm unversöhnlichen Hass geschworen! . .
   . Calvin fühlte sich fast nur noch als Werkzeug in der Hand Gottes,
   durch den ewigen göttlichen Rathschluss, ohne jedes persönliche Zuthun,
   für Genf bestimmt, um des Herrn Willen, wie er ihn erkannt, auf diesem
   wichtigen Fleck der Erde ohne Furcht und Scheu zu verkündigen, jenes
   Programm, welches er in der christlichen Institution niedergelegt, hier
   zur Ausführung zu bringen, dem Herrn hier ein christliches Geschlecht
   zu sammeln, das der übrigen Welt als Leuchte diene.'

   [818] This fact is related by Drelincourt in his Defense de Calvin
   (1667), and Bungener (p. 503), and is believed in Geneva, but doubted
   by Guizot, p. 237, for chronological reasons which are not conclusive
   (Sadolet died 1549). 'Se non e vero, e ben trovato.'

   [819] Beza: 'Per decem minimum annos prandio abstinuit, ut nullum
   omnino cibum extra statam coenæ horam sumeret.' Sometimes he abstained
   for thirty-six hours from all food.

   [820] See his testament in Beza's Vita.

   [821] Quoted by Guizot, p. 361.

   [822] 'Somni pene nullius,' says Beza in his closing remarks.

   [823] With Beza's account of his parting addresses (in the French and
   Latin edition of the Vita) should be compared the official copy, which
   Bonnet published in the Appendix to the French Letters, Tom. II. p.
   573, and the Strasburg editors at the close of the 9th vol. of the
   Opera (Discours d'adieu aux membres du Petit Conseil, pp. 887-890, and
   Discours d'adieu aux ministres, pp. 891-894). Comp. also Stähelin. Vol.
   II. pp. 462-468.

   [824] Hornung's picture of Calvin on his death-bed.

   [825] Beza, however, wrote a suitable poem, in Latin and French, which
   might have been inscribed on the tomb. See his Vita, at the close, and
   Opera, Vol. V. pp. xxvi. sqq. (with three other French sonnets); a
   German translation in Stähelin, Vol. II. p.470.

   [826] See different portraits of Calvin--in Henry (small biography), in
   first volume of the Opera, in Stähelin, in first volume of Merle
   d'Aubigné; also Hornung's Calvin on his death-bed, and the medallion
   portrait made at the festival of the Geneva Reformation. [In technical
   disregard of Calvin's wish the large mural monument was erected in
   Geneva, 1917, commemorating the Reformation and containing figures of
   Calvin, Luther, etc.--Ed.]

   [827] Beza thus tersely describes him (at the close of the Vita):
   'Statura fuit mediocri, colore subpallido et nigricante, oculis ad
   mortem usque limpidis, quique ingenii sagacitatem testarentur: cultu
   corporis neque culto neque sordido, sed qui singularem modestiam
   deceret: victu sic temperato, ut a sordibus et ab omni luxu longissime
   abesset: cibi parcissimi, ut qui multos annos semel quotidie cibum
   sumpserit, vintriculi imbecillitatem causatus: somni pæne nullius:
   memoriæ incredibilis, ut quos semel aspexisset multis post annis statim
   agnosceret, et inter dictandum sæpe aliquot horas interturbatus statim
   ad dictata nullo commonefaciente rediret, et eorum, quæ ipsum nosse
   muneris sui causa interesset, quantumvis multiplicibus et infinitis
   negotiis oppressus, nunquam tamen oblivisceretur. Judicii, quibuscunque
   de rebus consuleretur, tam puri et exacti, ut pæne vaticinari sæpe sit
   visus, nec aberasse meminerim, qui consilium ipsius esset sequutus.
   Facundiæ contemptor et verborum parcus, sed minime ineptus scriptor, et
   quo nullus ad hunc diem theologus (absit verbo invidia) purius,
   gravius, judiciosius denique scripsit, quum tamen tam multa scripserit,
   quam nemo vel nostra vel patrum memoria.'

   lotio for baptismus, etc.

   [830] This was the judgment of the magistrate of Geneva, expressed in
   these words (June 8, 1564): 'Dieu, lui avait imprimé un charactère
   d'une si grande majesté.'

   [832] His ungrateful enemy, Balduin, started the saying among the
   Genevese, 'Rather with Beza in hell than with Calvin in heaven.' And
   yet they obeyed and revered him. Beza, it should be remembered, was the
   perfection of a French gentleman; yet his theological system was even
   more severe than that of Calvin, and he carried the dogma of
   predestination to the extreme of supralapsarianism. I have met with not
   a few French, Scotch, and American Christians who, in the combination
   of severity and purity, gravity and kindliness of character, reminded
   me strongly of Calvin and Beza. I may mention Gaussen, Malan, Merle
   d'Aubigné, Pio ie Adolph Monod, and Guizot.

   [833] Page 362.

   [834] 'Nichts Grosses geschieht ohne Leidenschaft.'

   [835] The strongest terms of Calvin against ferocious enemies are
   canes, porci, bestial, nebulones (with reference, no doubt, to
   Scripture usage-- Isa. lvi. 10; Matt. vii. 6; Phil. iii. 2; Rev. xxii.
   15); but they are mild compared to the coarse and vulgar epithets with
   which Luther overwhelmed his opponents, without expressing any regret
   afterwards, except in the case of Henry VIII., where it was least
   needed, and made the matter worse.

   [836] Calvin, though fully aware of the defects of Luther, often
   expressed his admiration for him (see p. 430), and in January, 1545 (a
   year before Luther's death), he sent him a letter (which Melanchthon
   was afraid to hand to the old lion on account of his excited state of
   feeling against the Swiss), closing with these touching words: 'If I
   could only fly to you and enjoy your society, even for a few hours! . .
   . But since this privilege is not granted to me on earth, I hope I may
   soon enjoy it in the kingdom above. Farewell, most illustrious man,
   most excellent minister of Christ and father [pater, al. frater],
   forever venerable to me. May the Lord continue to guide you by his
   Spirit to the end for the common good of his Church.' Opera, Vol. XII.
   p. 8.

   [837] Guizot says (p. 164): 'Although Calvin was devoted to the severe
   simplicity of evangelical worship, he did not overlook the inherent
   love of mankind for poetry and art. He himself had a taste for music,
   and knew its power. He feared that, in a religious service limited to
   preaching and prayer only, the congregation, having nothing else to do
   than to play the part of audience, would remain cold and inattentive.
   For this reason he attached great importance to the introduction and
   promotion of the practice of Psalm-singing in public worship. "If the
   singing," he said, "is such as befits the reverence which we ought to
   feel when we sing before God and the angels, it is an ornament which
   bestows grace and dignity upon our worship; and it is an excellent
   method of kindling the heart, and making it burn with great ardor in
   prayer. But we must at all times take heed lest the ear should be more
   attentive to the harmony of the sound than the soul to the hidden
   meaning of the words" (Instit. Ch. XX.). With this pious warning, he
   strongly urged the study of singing, and its adaptation to public
   worship.' Comp. Gaberel, Vol. I. p. 353.

   [838] These poetic pieces were recently discovered, and published in
   the sixth volume of the new edition of his 0pera (1867), pp. 212-224.
   His Salutation à Jésus-Christ was translated into German by Stähelin,
   and into English by Mrs. Smith, of New York, for Schaff's Christ in
   Song, London edition, p. 549. His Epinicion Christo cantatum is a
   polemic poem in Latin hexameters and pentameters, composed during the
   Conference at Worms, 1541, in which he describes the Romish polemics
   Eck, Cochlæus, Nausea, and Pelargus as dragged after the chariot of the
   victorious Redeemer. Opera. Vol. V. pp. 417-428.

   [839] We omit Henry and Stähelin, from whom it would he difficult to
   select passages in praise of Calvin. See especially the entire Seventh
   Book of Stähelin, Vol. II., pp. 365-393: Calvin als Mensch und als
   Christ.

   [840] 'Ego historiam vitæ et obitus ipsius, cujus spectator sedecim
   annos fui, bona fide persequutus testari mihi optimo jure posse videor,

   OEcolampad's Tode verwaiste reformirte Kirche erhielt am Johann Calvin,
   gleich gross an Geist und Character, einen festen Mittelpunkt und eine
   ordnende Seele für Lehre und Kirchenverfassung. Durch ihn wurde Genf
   statt Zürichs die neue reformirte Metropole; und dieses Gemeinwesen
   bewies eine wunderbare, weithin erobernde Kraft. . . . Calvin's
   persönliche Erscheinung war die eines altrömischen Censors; er war von
   feinem Wuchs, blass, hager, mit dem Ausdruck tiefen Ernstes und
   einschneidender Schärfe. Der Senat von Genf sagte nach seinem Tode, er
   sei ein majestätischer Charakter gewesen. Liebenswürdig im socialen
   Leben, voll zarter Theilnahme und Freundestreue, nachsichtig und
   versöhnlich bei persönlichen Beleidigungen, war er unerbittlich streng,
   wo er Gottes Ehre in Hartnäckigkeit oder Bosheit angegriffen sah. Unter
   seinen Collegen hatte er keine Neider, aber viele begeisterte Verehrer.
   Französisches Feuer und praktischer Verstand schienen mit deutscher
   Tiefe und Besonnenheit einen Bund geschlossen zu haben. War er auch
   nicht spekulativen oder intuitiven Geistes, so war dagegen sein
   Verstand und sein Urtheil um so eindringender und schärfer, sein
   Gedächtniss umfassend; und er bewegte sich ebenso leicht in der Welt
   der Ideen und der Wissenschaft, wie in den Geschäften des
   Kirchenregiments. Zwar ist er nicht ein Mann des Volkes, wie Luther,
   sondern in seiner Sprache mehr der Gelehrte, und seine Wirksamkeit als
   Prediger und Seelsorger kann daher mit der Luthers nicht verglichen
   werden. Dagegen ist er mehr ein architektonischer Geist und zwar sowohl
   im Gebiete der Wissenschaft als des Lebens. Beide sind ihm in ihrer
   Wurzel eins, und seine dogmatischen Constructionen, so kühn sie in der
   Folgerichtigkeit ihrer Gedanken sind, behalten ihm doch immer zugleich
   erbaulichen Charakter. Auch wo er verwegen in die göttlichen
   Geheimnisse der Prädestination einzudringen sucht, immer leitet ihn der
   praktische Trieb, der Heiligkeit und Majestät Gottes zu dienen, für das
   Gemüth aber den ewigen Ankergrund zu finden, darin es im Bewusstsein
   der Erwählung durch freie Gnade sicher ruhen könne.'

   § 57. Calvin's Work.

   Of Calvin it may be said, without exaggeration, that he 'labored more'
   than all the other Reformers.

   He raised the little town of Geneva to the dignity and importance of
   the Protestant Rome. [848]

   From this radiating centre he controlled, directly or indirectly,
   through his writings and his living disciples, the Reformed, yea, we
   may say, the whole Protestant movement; for, wherever it had not
   already taken root, as in Germany and Scandinavia, Protestantism
   assumed a Calvinistic or semi-Calvinistic character. [849]

   His heart continued, indeed, to beat warmly for his native land, which
   he reluctantly left to share the fortunes of truth exiled, and he
   raised the cry which is to this day the motto of his faithful
   disciples: 'France must be evangelized to be saved.' But his true home
   was the Church of God. He broke through all national limitations. There
   was scarcely a monarch or statesman or scholar of his age with whom he
   did not come in contact. Every people of Europe was represented among
   his disciples. He helped to shape the religious character of churches
   and nations yet unborn. The Huguenots of France, the Protestants of
   Holland and Belgium, the Puritans and Independents of England and New
   England, the Presbyterians of Scotland and throughout the world, yea,
   we may say, the whole Anglo-Saxon race, in its prevailing religious
   character and institutions, bear the impress of his genius, and show
   the power and tenacity of his doctrines and principles of government.
   [850]

   From him proceeded the first Protestant missionary colony in the newly
   discovered American Continent. [851]

   He conceived the idea of a general Evangelical Alliance which, though
   impracticable in his age, found an echo in Melanchthon and Cranmer, and
   was revived in the nineteenth century (1846) to be realized at no
   distant future. [852]

   His work and influence were twofold, theological and ecclesiastical.
   With him theory and practice, theology and piety, were inseparably
   united. Even when, soaring beyond the limits of time, he dared to lift
   the veil of the eternal decrees of the omniscient Jehovah, he aimed at
   a strong motive for holiness, and a firm foundation of hope and
   comfort. On the other hand, his moral reforms are all based upon
   principles and ideas. He was thoroughly consistent in his views and
   actions.

   HIS THEOLOGY.

   As a scientific theologian, Calvin stands foremost among the Reformers,
   and is the peer of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. He has been styled the
   Aristotle of Protestantism. Melanchthon, 'the Teacher of Germany,'
   first called him 'the Theologian,' in the emphatic sense in which this
   title was given to Gregory of Nazianzen in the Nicene age, and to the
   inspired Apostle John. The verdict of history has confirmed this
   judgment. Even Rationalists and Roman Catholics must admit his
   pre-eminence among the systematic divines and exegetes of all ages.
   [853]

   The appearance of his Institutes of the Christian Religion [854] (first
   in Latin, then in French) marks an epoch in the history of theology,
   and has all the significance of an event. This book belongs to those
   few uninspired compositions which never lose their interest and power.
   It has not only a literary, but an institutional character. Considering
   the youth of the author, it is a marvel of intellectual precocity. The
   first edition even contained, in brief outline, all the essential
   elements of his system; and the subsequent enlargements to five times
   the original size were not mechanical additions to a building or
   changes of conviction, [855] but the natural growth of a living
   organism from within. [856]

   The 'Institutes' are by far the clearest and ablest systematic and
   scientific exposition and vindication of the ideas of the Reformation
   in their vernal freshness and pentecostal fire. The book is inspired by
   a heroic faith ready for the stake, and a glowing enthusiasm for the
   saving truth of the gospel, raised to a new life from beneath the
   rubbish of human additions. Though freely using reason and the fathers,
   especially Augustine, it always appeals to the supreme tribunal of the
   Word of God, to which all human wisdom must bow in reverent obedience.
   It abounds in Scripture-learning thoroughly digested, and wrought up
   into a consecutive chain of exposition and argument. It is severely
   logical, but perfectly free from the dryness and pedantry of a
   scholastic treatise, and flows on, like a Swiss river, through green
   meadows and sublime mountain scenery. It overshadowed all previous
   attempts at a systematic treatment of Protestant doctrines, not only
   those of Zwingli and Farel, but even Melanchthon's Loci theologici,
   although Calvin generously edited them twice in a French translation
   with a complimentary preface (1546). [857]

   No wonder that the 'Institutes' were greeted with enthusiastic praises
   by Protestants, which are not exhausted to this day. [858] They created
   dismay among Romanists, were burned at Paris by order of the Sorbonne,
   and hated and feared as the very 'Talmud' and 'Koran of heresy.' [859]
   In spite of severe prohibition, they were translated into all the
   languages of Europe, and passed through innumerable editions. Among the
   Protestants of France they acquired almost as much authority as
   Luther's Bible in Germany, and comforted the martyrs in prison. In
   England, after the accession of Elizabeth, they were long used as the
   text-book of theology; and even the moderate and 'judicious' Hooker
   prized them highly, and pronounced Calvin 'incomparably the wisest man
   that ever the French Church did enjoy.'

   This remarkable work was originally a defense of the evangelical
   doctrines against ignorant or willful misrepresentation, and a plea for
   toleration in behalf of his scattered fellow-Protestants in France, who
   were then violently persecuted as a set of revolutionary fanatics and
   heretics. Hence the dedicatory Preface to Francis I. As the early
   Apologists addressed the Roman emperors to convince them that the
   Christians were innocent of the foul charges of atheism, immorality,
   and hostility to Caesar, so Calvin appealed to the French monarch in
   defense of his equally innocent countrymen, with a manly dignity,
   frankness, force, and pathos never surpassed before or since. It is a
   sad reflection that such a voice of warning should have had so little
   effect, and that the noble French nation even this day would rather
   listen to the revolutionary 'Marseillaise' of Voltaire and Rousseau
   than to the reformatory trumpet of Calvin.

   The 'Institutes,' to which this dedication to the French monarch forms
   the magnificent portal, consist of four books (each divided into a
   number of chapters), and treat, after the natural and historical order
   of the Apostles' Creed, first of the knowledge of God the Creator
   (theology); secondly, of the knowledge of God the Redeemer
   (christology); thirdly, of the Holy Spirit and the application of the
   saving work of Christ (soteriology); fourthly, of the external means of
   salvation, viz., the Church and the Sacraments. [860]

   The most prominent and original features of Calvin's theological
   system, which have left their impress upon the Reformed Creed, are the
   doctrine of Predestination and the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. By
   the first he widened the breach between the Reformed and the Lutheran
   Church; by the second he furnished a basis for reconciliation.

   THE DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION.

   All the Reformers of the sixteenth century, including even the gentle
   Melanchthon and the compromising Bucer, under a controlling sense of
   human depravity and saving grace, in extreme antagonism to Pelagianism
   and self-righteousness, and, as they sincerely believed, in full
   harmony not only with the greatest of the fathers, but also with the
   inspired St. Paul, came to the same doctrine of a double predestination
   which decides the eternal destiny of all men. Nor is it possible to
   evade this conclusion on the two acknowledged premises of Protestant
   orthodoxy--namely, the wholesale condemnation of men in Adam, and the
   limitation of saving grace to the present world. If the Lutheran
   theology, after the Formula of Concord (1577), rejected Synergism and
   Calvinism alike, and yet continued to teach the total depravity of all
   men and the unconditional election of some, it could only be done at
   the expense of logical consistency. [861]

   Yet there were some characteristic differences among the Reformers.
   Luther started from the servum arbitrium, Zwingli from the idea of an
   all-ruling providentia, Calvin from the timeless or eternal decretum
   absolution. Calvin elaborated the doctrine of predestination with
   greater care and precision, and avoided 'the paradoxes' of his
   predecessors. He made it, moreover, the corner-stone of his system, and
   gave it undue proportion. He set the absolute sovereignty of God over
   against the mock sovereignty of the Pope. It was for him the 'article
   of the standing or falling Church;' while Luther always assigned this
   position to the doctrine of justification by faith alone. In this
   estimate, both were mistaken, for the central place in the Christian
   system belongs only to the person and work of Christ--the incarnation
   and the atonement. Finally, the Augustinian and Lutheran
   predestinarianism is moderated by the sacramentarian principle of
   baptismal regeneration; while the Calvinistic predestinarianism
   confines the sacramental efficacy to the elect, and turns the baptism
   of the non-elect into an empty form.

   Predestination, according to Calvin, is the eternal and unchangeable
   decree of God by which he foreordained, for his own glory and the
   display of his attributes of mercy and justice, a part of the human
   race, without any merit of their own, to eternal salvation, and another
   part, in just punishment of their sin, to eternal damnation. The decree
   is, therefore, twofold--a decree of election to holiness and salvation,
   and a decree of reprobation on account of sin and guilt. [862] The
   latter is the negative counterpart, which strict logic seems to demand,
   but against which our better feelings revolt, especially if it is made
   to include multitudes of innocent children, for their unconscious
   connection with Adam's fall. Calvin himself felt this, and
   characteristically called the decree of reprobation a 'decree horrible,
   though nevertheless true.' [863] All he could say was that God's will
   is inscrutable, but always holy and unblamable. It is the ultimate
   ground of all things, and the highest rule of justice. Foreordination
   and foreknowledge are inseparable, and the former is not conditioned by
   the latter, but God foresees what he foreordains. If election were
   dependent on man's faith and good works, grace would not be free, and
   in fact would cease to be grace. Man's holiness is not the cause or
   condition, but the effect of God's election. The unequal distribution
   of gospel privileges can be traced only to the secret will of God. All
   men are alike corrupt and lost in Adam; some are saved by free grace,
   others, who are no worse by nature, reject the gospel. These are
   undeniable every-day facts, and admit of no other explanation within
   the limits of the present life; and as to the future world, we know
   nothing but what God has revealed to us in the Scriptures.

   Calvin carried the doctrine of the divine decrees beyond the
   Augustinian infralapsarianism, which makes the fall of Adam the object
   of a permissive or passive decree, and teaches the preterition rather
   than the reprobation of the wicked, to the very verge of
   supralapsarianism, which traces even the first sin to an efficient or
   positive decree, analogous to that of election. But while his
   inexorable logic pointed to this abyss, his moral and religious sense
   shrunk from the last inference of making God the author of sin, which
   would be blasphemous, and involve the absurdity that God abhors and
   justly punishes what he himself decreed. Hence his phrase, which
   vacillates between infralapsarianism and supralapsarianism: 'Adam fell,
   God' providence having so ordained it; yet he fell by his own guilt.'
   [864]

   Calvin defended this doctrine against all objections with consummate
   skill, and may be said to have exhausted the subject on his side of the
   question. His arguments were chiefly drawn from the Scriptures,
   especially the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans; but he
   unduly stretched passages which refer to the historical destiny of
   individuals and nations in this world, into declarations of their
   eternal fate in the other world; and he escaped the proper force of
   opposite passages (such as John i. 29; iii. 16; 1 John ii. 2; iv. 14; 1
   Tim. ii. 4; 2 Pet. iii. 9) by a distinction between the secret and
   revealed or declared will of God (voluntas arcani and voluntas
   beneplaciti), which carries an intolerable dualism into the divine
   will.

   The motive and aim of this doctrine was not speculative, but practical.
   It served as a bulwark of free grace, an antidote to Pelagianism and
   human pride, a stimulus to humility and gratitude, a source of comfort
   and peace in trial and despondency. The charge of favoring license and
   carnal security was always indignantly repelled by the Pauline 'God
   forbid!' It is moreover refuted by history, which connects the
   strictest Calvinism with the strictest morality.

   The doctrine of predestination, in its milder, infralapsarian form, was
   incorporated into the Geneva Consensus, the Second Helvetic, the
   French, Belgic, and Scotch Confessions, the Lambeth Articles, the Irish
   Articles, the Canons of Dort, and the Westminster Standards; while the
   Thirty-nine Articles, [865] the Heidelberg Catechism, and other German
   Reformed Confessions, indorse merely the positive part of the free
   election of believers, and are wisely silent concerning the decree of
   reprobation, leaving it to theological science and private opinion.

   Supralapsarianism, which makes unfallen man, or man before his creation
   (i.e., a non ens, a mere abstraction of thought), the object of God's
   double foreordination for the manifestation of his mercy in the elect,
   and his justice in the reprobate, was ably advocated by Beza in Geneva,
   Gomarus in Holland, Twisse (the Prolocutor of the Westminster Assembly)
   in England, Nathaniel Emmons (1745-1840) in New England, but it never
   received symbolical authority, and was virtually or expressly excluded
   (though not exactly condemned) by the Synod of Dort, the Westminster
   Assembly, and even the 'Formula Consensus Helvetica' (1675). [866] All
   Calvinistic Confessions, without exception, trace the fall to a
   permissive decree, make man responsible and justly punishable for sin,
   and reject, as a blasphemous slander, the charge that God is the author
   of sin. And this is the case with all the Calvinistic divines of the
   present day. [867]

   CALVIN'S DOCTRINE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.

   Calvin's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, on which he spent much deep and
   earnest thought, is an ingenious compromise between the realism and
   mysticism of the Lutheran, and the idealism and spiritualism of the
   Zwinglian theory. It aims to satisfy both the heart and the reason.

   He retained the figurative interpretation of the words of institution,
   and rejected all carnal and materialistic conceptions of the
   eucharistic mystery; but he very strongly asserted, at the same time, a
   spiritual real presence and fruition of Christ's body and blood for the
   nourishment of the soul. He taught that believers, while they receive
   with their mouths the visible elements, receive also by faith the
   spiritual realities signified and sealed thereby, namely, the benefit
   of the atoning sacrifice on the cross, and the life-giving virtue of
   Christ's glorified humanity in heaven, which the Holy Ghost conveys to
   the soul in a supernatural manner; while unbelieving or unworthy
   communicants, having no inward connection with Christ, receive only
   bread and wine to their own judgment. He thus sought to avoid alike the
   positive error of Luther and the negative error of Zwingli (whose view
   of the Eucharist he even characterized as 'profane'), and to unite the
   elements of truth advocated by both in a one-sided and antagonistic
   way. Luther and Zwingli always had in mind a corporeal or dimensional
   presence of the material substance of body and blood, and an oral
   manducation of the same by all communicants--which the one affirmed,
   the other denied; Calvin substituted for this the idea of a virtual or
   dynamic presence of the psychic life-power and efficacy of Christ's
   humanity, and a spiritual reception and assimilation of the same by the
   organ of faith, and therefore on the part of believing communicants
   only, through the secret mediation of the Holy Spirit. [868]

   Calvin's doctrine of the Eucharist was substantially approved by
   Melanchthon in his later period, although from fear of Luther and the
   ultra-Lutherans he never fully committed himself. It passed into all
   the leading Reformed Confessions of the sixteenth and seventeenth
   centuries, and must be regarded as the orthodox Reformed doctrine.
   Zwingli's theory, which is more simple and intelligible, has
   considerable popular currency, but no symbolical authority. [869]

   Calvin thus combined his high predestinarianism with a high view of the
   Church and the Sacraments. Augustine and Luther did the same to a still
   greater extent, with more prominence given to the sacramental idea. It
   is the prerogative of great minds to maintain apparently opposite
   truths and principles which hold each other in check; while with minds
   less strong and comprehensive, the one principle is apt to rule out the
   other. In the Catholic and Lutheran Churches the sacramental principle
   gradually overruled the doctrine of absolute predestination; in the
   more rigid Calvinistic school, the sacramental principle yielded to the
   doctrine of predestination. But the authoritative standards are
   committed to both.

   CALVIN AS AN EXEGETE.

   Among the works which have more or less influenced the Reformed
   Confessions we can not ignore Calvin's commentaries. To expound the
   Scriptures in books, from the chair, and from the pulpit, was his
   favorite occupation. His whole theology is scriptural rather than
   scholastic, and distinguished for the skillful and comprehensive
   working up of the teaching of the Bible, as the only pure fountain of
   revealed truth and the infallible rule of the Christian faith. As it is
   systematically comprehended in his 'Institutes,' and defended in his
   various polemical tracts against Sadolet, Pighius, the Council of
   Trent, Caroli, Bolsec, Castallio, Westphal, Heshusius, so it is
   scattered through his Commentaries on the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles,
   and the principal books of the Old Testament, especially the Psalms and
   the Prophets. He opened this important series of works, during his
   sojourn at Strasburg, by an exposition of the Epistle to the Romans
   (1539), on which his theological system is chiefly based.

   He could assert with truth on his death-bed that he never knowingly
   twisted or misinterpreted a single passage of the Scriptures, that he
   always aimed at simplicity, and restrained the temptation to show
   acuteness and ingenuity. He regarded it as the chief object of a
   commentator to adhere closely to the text, and to bring out clearly and
   briefly the meaning of the writer. He detested irrelevant talk and
   diffuseness, and avoided allegorical fancies, which substitute pious
   imposition for honest exposition. He combined in a very rare degree all
   the necessary hermeneutical qualifications, a fair knowledge of Greek
   and Hebrew, sound grammatical tact, thorough sympathy with the spirit
   and aim of the Bible, and aptitude for fruitful practical application.
   He could easily enter into the peculiar situation of the Prophets and
   Apostles, as though he had been with them in their trials, and shared
   their varied experience. He is free from pedantry, and his exposition
   is an easy, continuous flow of reproduction. He never evades
   difficulties, but frankly meets and tries to solve them.

   With all his profound reverence for the Word of God, to which his
   reason bows in cheerful obedience, he is not swayed by a peculiar
   theory of inspiration or dogmatic prejudice, but shows often remarkable
   freedom and sagacity in discovering the direct historical import of
   prophecies, in distinction from their ulterior Messianic bearing. [870]
   He notices the difference of style and argument in the Second Epistle
   of Peter as compared with the first, and in the Epistle to the Hebrews
   as compared with the undisputed Pauline Epistles. He never ventured to
   explain the mysteries of the Apocalypse. Luther, with an equally
   profound reverence and enthusiasm for the Word of God, was even much
   bolder, and passed sweeping judgments on whole books of the canon (as
   the Epistle of James, the book of Esther, and the book of Revelation),
   because he could not find enough of Christ in them. Calvin and his
   followers retained the Canon in full, but excluded more rigidly the
   Apocrypha of the Old Testament.

   The scholastic Calvinism and Lutheranism of the seventeenth century
   departed from the more liberal view of the Reformers on the mode and
   degree of inspiration, and substituted for it a rigid mechanical theory
   which ignored the human and historical aspect of the Scriptures, and
   reduced the sacred writers to mere penmen of the Holy Ghost. This
   theory found symbolical expression in the 'Formula Consensus Helvetica'
   (1675), which advocates even the inspiration of the Hebrew-vowel
   points, and cuts off all textual criticism.

   Upon the whole, Calvin is ' beyond all question the greatest exegete of
   the sixteenth century,' [871] which of all centuries was the most
   fruitful in this department of sacred learning. Luther was the prince
   of translators; Calvin, the prince of commentators. Augustine and
   Luther had occasionally a deeper intuition into the meaning of
   difficult passages, and seized on the main idea with the instinct of
   genius; but Calvin was more accurate and precise, and more uniformly
   excellent. Modern commentators have made great progress in textual
   criticism and grammatical and historical exegesis, but do not attain to
   his religious depth and fervor. His commentaries have stood the test of
   time, and will always be consulted with profit. Scaliger, who was
   displeased with all men, said that no scholar had penetrated so deeply
   into the meaning of the Prophets as Calvin; the Roman Catholic critic
   Richard Simon admitted that his commentaries would be 'useful to the
   whole world,' if they were free from declamations against popery; and
   of all older expounders none is more frequently quoted by the best
   modern critical scholars than John Calvin. [872]

   CALVIN'S CHURCH POLITY.

   The practical and ecclesiastical part of Calvin's work is in some
   respects even more important than his theology, and must be briefly
   considered in those features which have affected the Calvinistic
   Confessions. These are the duty of discipline, the principle of
   lay-representation, and the autonomy of the Church in its relation to
   the State. In these points Calvinism differs from Lutheranism, and also
   from Zwinglianism and Anglicanism. Calvin aimed at a moral and social
   as well as a doctrinal and religious reformation, and succeeded in
   establishing a model Church, which excited the admiration not only of
   sympathizing contemporaries, like Farel and Knox, [873] but even of
   visitors of other creeds long after his death. [874] During the
   eighteenth century his severe system of theology and discipline gave
   way to the prevailing spirit of Socinianism and the revolutionary
   spirit of Jean Jacques Rousseau--the counterpart of Calvin; but revived
   in the nineteenth century, though in a modified form, so that Geneva
   has become a second time the centre of evangelistic labors in the
   French-speaking world. [875]

   1. Discipline.--Calvin's zeal for discipline, especially for the honor
   of the Lord's table, in excluding unworthy communicants, was the cause
   of his expulsion from Geneva, the cause of his recall from Strasburg,
   the condition of his acceptance, the struggle and triumph of his life.
   He had a long and fierce conflict with the ferocious politico-religious
   party of the Libertines, or 'Spirituals,' as they called themselves,
   who combined a pantheistic creed with licentiousness and free-lovism,
   and anticipated the worst forms of modern infidelity to the extent of
   declaring the gospel a tissue of lies of less value than Æsop's Fables.
   [876] He regarded them as worse enemies of God and the truth than the
   Pope. They resorted to personal indignities and every device of
   intimidation; they named the very dogs of the street after him; they
   one night fired fifty shots before his bedchamber; they threatened him
   in the pulpit; they approached the communion table as if to seize the
   sacred elements, when he cried out, 'You may break these limbs and shed
   my blood, I would rather die than dishonor the table of my God,'
   whereupon they left the church. On another occasion he walked into the
   midst of an excited mob and offered his breast to their daggers. It
   seems incredible that a man constitutionally 'unwarlike and timorous'
   should have completely overcome at last such a powerful and determined
   opposition, which reached its height in 1553.

   The system of discipline which he established saved Geneva from
   anarchy, into which the Libertines would have plunged it, and was a
   training-school of self-government for other Reformed Churches; but it
   was carried to unwarrantable excesses in the punishment of religious
   and civil offenses, and even innocent amusements, and entered too much
   into details of private and domestic life.

   2. Presbyterian and Synodical Church Polity.--It rests on the principle
   of ministerial equality, and the principle of lay-representation by
   elders or seniors in the government of the Church. This polity, founded
   by Calvin, was consistently carried out in the Presbyterian Churches of
   France, Holland, Scotland, England, and the United States; but in
   German Switzerland and Germany it succeeded only partially, while the
   Church of England retained the Episcopal hierarchy. Calvin himself,
   however, was not an exclusive Presbyterian. He allowed modifications of
   the form of government in different countries. He did not object to
   Episcopacy or the liturgical worship in England; he only protested
   against the ecclesiastical supremacy of Henry VIII. and a number of
   abuses.

   3. The Autonomy of the Church.--The German Reformers, including
   Zwingli, yielded too much authority to the civil rulers in matters of
   religion. Calvin theoretically made the Church independent in her own
   sphere, and claimed for her the right of self-government. This leads
   consistently to a separation of Church and State, where the latter is
   hostile to the former, as was the case in France and to some extent in
   Scotland. In recent times the Calvinistic Churches, without changing
   their creed, tend naturally towards complete freedom, from State
   control. Yet in practice he had no idea of such a separation. He
   regarded the civil and the spiritual power as the two arms of God's
   government in the world, which should co-operate together for the same
   end--the glory of God and the good of society: the Church by infusing a
   religious spirit into the State, the State by protecting and promoting
   the interests of the Church. He established, after the model of the Old
   Testament, a theocracy at Geneva, and governed it by tacit consent as
   long as he lived, presiding over the 'Venerable Company' of Pastors,
   and exerting a molding influence upon the civil legislation of the
   little republic of about 20,000 inhabitants. [877]

   Bossuet, Möhler, and other Roman Catholic divines saw in this a return
   to the hierarchy, with Calvin as its pope. He has sometimes been
   compared to Hildebrand; and Kampschulte remarks that the dominion of
   the spiritual sovereignty was more thoroughly carried out in Geneva
   than by the Gregories and Innocenses in the Middle Ages. But Calvin's
   theocracy differed essentially from the Roman Catholic by its popular
   (though by no means democratic) basis: it was not priestcraft ruling
   over statecraft, but a self-governing Christian commonwealth. Geneva
   was an aristocratic republic, ruled by the clergy and the people in
   orderly representation and friendly co-operation. The highest civil and
   executive power was lodged in the 'Little Council' of twenty-four
   syndics, the highest ecclesiastical power in the 'Consistory,' composed
   (at first) of six pastors and double that number of lay-elders. [878]

   RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

   Unfortunately Calvin inherited from the Theodosian Code and the
   Catholic Church the worst feature of the theocratic system, namely, the
   principle of appeal to the secular arm for the temporal, and, if
   necessary, capital punishment of spiritual offenses, as being offenses
   against the order and peace of society. This principle is inconsistent
   with liberty of conscience (which Beza called a diabolical dogma), and
   justifies all manner of persecution, as duty or policy may suggest.
   With his intense antagonism to the papal tyranny, he might have thrown
   off this relic of the Middle Ages, if it had not been for his
   conviction of the perpetual validity of the Mosaic civil code and his
   theocratic theory. He thought that the burning of innocent people by
   Romanists was no good reason why Protestants should spare the guilty.

   It was the misfortune of Calvin that this false theory, which confounds
   two distinct spheres and ignores the spiritual nature of Christ's
   kingdom, was brought to its severest test and explosion under his own
   eye, and to the perpetual injury of his fair fame. "We mean, of course,
   the terrible theological tragedy of the Spanish physician Michael
   Servetus, a restless fanatic, a pantheistic pseudo-reformer, and the
   most audacious and even blasphemous heretic of the sixteenth century,
   who attacked the doctrine of the Holy Trinity as tritheistic and
   atheistic, as the greatest monstrosity, and the source of all
   corruption in the Church. After being condemned to death, and burned in
   effigy by the Roman Catholic authorities in France, [879] he fled to
   Geneva, was arrested, tried, and executed at the stake, for heresy and
   blasphemy, by the civil government, with the full consent of Calvin,
   except that he made an ineffectual plea for a mitigation of the
   punishment (by a substitution of the sword for the fagot). [880]

   Severely as we must condemn the great Reformer, from the standpoint of
   our modern civilization, for this the saddest mistake of his life, it
   is evident that even here he acted consistently and conscientiously,
   and that the blame attaches not to his personal character (for towards
   sincere and earnest heretics, like Lælius Socinus, he showed marked
   courtesy and leniency), but to his system, and not to his system alone,
   but to the inherited system of his age, which had not yet emerged from
   the traditions of the Romish pseudo-theocracy. The burning of Servetus
   was fully approved by all the Reformers--Beza, Farel, Bucer, Bullinger,
   even the mild and gentle Melanchthon. [881] If Romanists condemned
   Calvin, they did it from hatred of the man, and condemned him for
   following their own example even in this particular case. The public
   opinion of Christendom at that time and down to the eighteenth century
   justified the right and duty of civil government not only to protect
   but to support orthodoxy, and to punish heresy by imprisonment, exile,
   and death; and this right was exercised, with more or less severity, in
   all countries of Europe, and even in Puritan New England during the
   colonial period. Protestants differed from Romanists only in their
   definition of heresy, and by greater moderation in its punishment.
   Protestants complained of being innocently persecuted in France, Spain,
   Holland, and under the bloody Mary in England; and Catholics raised the
   same complaint against the systematic cruelty of the penal code of
   Queen Elizabeth, which looked to the utter extermination of Romanism
   and Puritanism alike.

   A protest against the principle of persecution, first raised by Justin
   Martyr and Tertullian in the early Church, but forgotten as soon as the
   Church ascended the throne of the Cæsars, was revived by heretical
   Anabaptists and Socinians, who themselves suffered from it, without
   having a chance to persecute their persecutors, and who thus became
   martyrs of religious freedom. All honor to them, even to Servetus, for
   the service they rendered under this view to future generations.
   Liberty is the sweet fruit of bitter persecution. During the
   seventeenth century this feeble and isolated protest was considerably
   strengthened by Arminians, Baptists, and Quakers for the same reason;
   and during the eighteenth century Christian liberality and philanthropy
   on the one hand, and religious indifferentism and infidelity on the
   other, made such progress that the doctrinal foundations of persecution
   were gradually undermined, and toleration (as it was first
   patronizingly and condescendingly called, and is still called in
   despotic countries) became the professed policy of civilized
   governments. But this is not enough: all Christian governments should
   legally recognize and protect liberty of conscience, as an inherent and
   inalienable right of every immortal soul; and this requires for its
   full realization a peaceful separation of Church and State, or an
   equality of all denominations before the law.

   In view of this radical revolution of public opinion on the subject of
   persecution, it becomes a practical question whether those sections of
   the Protestant confessions of faith which treat of the relation of
   Church and State should not be reconstructed and adapted to the
   principle of religious freedom, all the more since the Papal Syllabus
   has consistently condemned it, as being one of the errors of modern
   times. Such a change, at all events, is necessary in the United States,
   and has actually been made in the American revision of the Thirty-Nine
   Articles, and of the Westminster Confession.

   The principle of religious liberty does not necessarily, as was
   formerly supposed, imply indifference to truth or a weakening of
   intensity of conviction. It follows legitimately from a sharper
   discrimination between the secular and spiritual sphere, between the
   Old and the New Testaments, between the law of Moses and the gospel of
   Christ, and from the spirit and example of Him who said, 'My kingdom is
   not of this world,' and who commanded the carnal-minded Peter to 'put
   up his sword into the sheath.' God alone is Lord of the conscience, and
   allows no one with impunity to interfere with his sovereign right.
   Religion flourishes best in the atmosphere of freedom, and need not
   fear error as long as truth is left free to combat it.

   It is nevertheless true that Calvinism, by developing the power of
   self-government and a manly spirit of independence which fears no man,
   though seated on a throne, because it fears God, the only sovereign,
   has been one of the chief agencies in bringing about this progress, and
   that civil and religious liberty triumphed first and most completely in
   Calvinistic countries. 'Calvin,' says Guizot, 'is undoubtedly one of
   those who did most towards the establishment of religious liberty.'

   [848] The eminent French historian, H. Martin (in his Histoire de
   France depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu'en 1789, Tom. VIII. p.
   325 of the fourth edition, Par. 1860), thus speaks of what Calvin did
   for the city of Geneva: 'Calvin ne la sauve pas seulement, mais
   conquiert à cette petite ville une grandeur, une puissance morale
   immense. Il en fait la capitale de la Réforme, autant que la Réforme
   peut avoir une capitale, pour la moitié du monde protestante, avec une
   vaste influence, acceptée ou subie, sur l'autre moitié. Genève n'est
   rien par la population, par les armes, par le territoire: elle est tout
   par l'esprit. Un seul avantage matériel lui garantit tous ses avantages
   moraux: son admirable position, qui fait d'elle une petite France
   républicaine et protestante, indépendante de la monarchie catholique de
   France et à l'abri de l'absorption monarchique et catholique; la Suisse
   protestante, alliée necessaire de la royauté française contre
   l'empereur, couvre Genève par la politique vis-à-vis du roi et par
   l'épée contre la maison d'Autriche et de Savoie.'

   [849] Kampschulte, Vol. I. p. xii.: Der romanische Reformator zählte
   seine Anhänger in der romanischen, germanischen und slavischen Welt und
   zeigte sich überall, wo nicht das Lutherthum in dem deutschen Character
   eine Stütze fand, diesem überlegen.' He quotes the fact that in
   Bohemia, which borders on Germany, the Slavonian Protestants nearly all
   profess Calvinism, while Lutheranism is confined to the Germans. The
   same is still more the case with the Anglo-Saxon race in England,
   America, and Australia, and in the mission fields among the heathen. In
   Italy and Spain, too, the Waldenses and the evangelical Churches are,
   both in doctrine and discipline, much more Calvinistic than Lutheran;
   but so far Protestantism has a very feeble hold on the Latin races,
   which are more apt to swing from popery to infidelity, and from
   infidelity to popery, than to adopt the via media either of Lutheranism
   or Calvinism or Anglicanism.

   [850] 'In his vast correspondence we find him conversing familiarly
   with the Reformers--Farel, Viret, Beza, Bullinger, Bucer, Grynæus,
   Knox, Melanchthon--on the most important religious and theological
   questions of his age; counseling and exhorting Prince Condé, Jeanne
   D'Albret, mother of Henry IV., Admiral Coligny, the Duchess of Ferrara,
   King Sigismund of Poland, Edward VI. of England, and the Duke of
   Somerset; respectfully reproving Queen Marguerite of Navarre;
   withstanding libertines and the pseudo-Protestants; strengthening the
   martyrs, and directing the Reformation in Switzerland, France, Poland,
   England, and Scotland. He belongs to the small number of men who have
   exerted a moulding influence, not only upon their own age and country,
   but also upon future generations in various parts of the world; and not
   only upon the Church, but indirectly also upon the political, moral,
   and social life. The history of Switzerland, Germany, France, the
   Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States for the last three
   hundred years bears upon a thousand pages the impress of his mind and
   character. He raised the small republic of Geneva to the reputation of
   a Protestant Rome. He gave the deepest impulse to the Reform movement,
   which involved France, his native land, in a series of bloody civil
   wars, which furnished a host of martyrs to the evangelical faith, and
   which continues to live in that powerful nation in spite of the horrid
   massacre of St. Bartholomew and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
   the dragoonades and exile of hosts of Huguenots, who, driven from their
   native soil, carried their piety, virtue, and industry to all parts of
   Western Europe and North America. He kindled the religious fire which
   roused the moral and intellectual strength of Holland, and consumed the
   dungeons of the Inquisition and the fetters of the political despotism
   of Spain. His genius left a stronger mark on the national character of
   the Anglo-Saxon race and the Churches of Great Britain than their
   native Reformers. His theology and piety raised Scotland from a
   semi-barbarous condition, and made it the classical soil of
   Presbyterian Christianity, and one of the most enlightened, energetic,
   and virtuous countries on the face of the globe. His spirit stirred up
   the Puritan revolution of the seventeenth century, and his blood ran in
   the veins of Hampden and Cromwell, as well as Baxter and Owen. He may
   be called, in some sense, the spiritual father of New England and the
   American republic. Calvinism, in its various modifications and
   applications, was the controlling agent in the early history of our
   leading colonies (as Bancroft has shown); and Calvinism is, to this
   day, the most powerful element in the religious and ecclesiastical life
   of the Western world.'--From the author's Essay on Calvin, in the Bibl.
   Sacra for 1857.

   [851] On the interesting French colony in Brazil, 1556, consisting of
   two clergymen and about two hundred members of the Church of Geneva,
   see Stähelin, Vol. II. pp. 234 sqq. The colony was broken up by the
   interference of the French government and by Papal intrigues. But it
   was a harbinger of the later emigrations of persecuted Huguenots in
   several parts of North America, who enriched the Presbyterian, Dutch,
   and German Reformed and other Churches.

   [853] The Strasburg editors of Calvin's Works, though belonging to the
   modern liberal school of theology, thus characterize him as a
   theologian (Opera, Vol. I. p. ix.): 'Si Lutherum virum maximum, si
   Zwinglium civem Christianum nulli secundum, si Melanthonem præceptorem
   doctissimum merito appellaris, Calvinum jure vocaris theologorum
   principem et antesignanum. In hoc enim quis linguarum et literarum
   præsidia, quis disciplinarum fere omnium non miretur orbem? De cujus
   copia doctrinæ, rerumque dispositione aptissime concinnata, et
   argumentorum vi ac validitate in dogmaticis; de ingenii acumine et
   subtilitate, atque nunc festiva nunc mordaci salsedine in polemicis, de
   felicissima perspicuitate, sobrietate ac sagacitate in exegeticis, de
   nervosa eloquentia et libertate in paræneticis; de prudentia
   sapientiaque legislatoria in ecclesiis constituendis, ordinandis ac
   regendis incomparabili, inter omnes viros doctos et de rebus
   evangelicis libere sentientes jam abunde constat. Imo inter ipsos
   adversarios romanos nullus hodie est, vel mediocri harum rerum
   cognitione imbutus vel tantilla judicii præditus æquitate, qui
   argumentorum et sententiarum ubertatem, proprietatem verborum
   sermonemque castigatum, stili denique, tam latini quam gallici,
   gravitatem et luciditatem non admiretur. Quæ cuncta quum in singulis
   fere scriptis, tum præcipue relucent in immortali illa Institutione
   religionis Christianæ, quæ omnes ejusdem generis expositiones inde ab
   apostolorum temporibus conscriptas, adeoque ipsos Melanthonis Locos
   theologicos, absque omni controversia longe antecellit atque eruditum
   et ingenuum lectorem, etiamsi alicubi secus senserit, hodieque quasi
   vinetum trahit et vel invitum rapit in admirationem.' To this we add a
   remarkable tribute of a liberal Roman Catholic historian who abhors
   Calvin's doctrine of absolute predestination, and yet becomes eloquent
   when he speaks of the literary merits of his 'Institutes.' 'Sein
   Lehrbuch der christlichen Religion,' says Kampschulte (Vol. I. p.
   xiv.), 'bringt die kirchliche Revolution in ein System, das durch
   logische Schärfe, Klarheit des Gedankens, rücksichtslose Consequenz,
   die vor nichts zurückbebt, noch heute unser Staunen und unsere
   Bewunderung erregt.' Ibid. p. 274: 'Calvin's Lehrbuch der christlichen
   Religion ist ohne Frage das hervorragendste und bedeutendste
   Erzeugniss, welches die reformatorische Literatur des sechszehnten
   Jahrhunderts auf dem Gebiete der Dogmatik aufzuweisen hat. Schon ein
   oberflächlicher Vergleich lässt uns den gewaltigen Fortschritt
   erkennen, den es gegenüber den bisherigen Leistungen auf diesem Gebiete
   bezeichnet. Statt der unvollkommenen, nach der einen oder andern Seite
   unzulänglichen Versuche Melanchthon's, Zwingli's, Farel's erhalten wir
   aus Calvin's Hand das Kunstwerk eines, wenn auch nicht harmonisch in
   sich abgeschlossenen, so doch wohlgegliederten, durchgebildeten
   Systems, das in allen seinen Theilen die leitenden Grundgedanken
   widerspiegelt und von vollständiger Beherrschung des Stoffes zeugt. Es
   hatte eine unverkennbare Berechtigung, wenn man den Verfasser der
   Institution als den Aristoteles der Reformation bezeichnete. Die
   ausserordentliche Belesenheit in der biblischen und patristischen
   Literatur, wie sie schon in den früheren Ausgaben des Werkes
   hervortritt, setzt in Erstaunen. Die Methode ist lichtvoll und klar,
   der Gedankengang streng logisch, überall durchsichtig, die Eintheilung
   und Ordnung des Stoffes dem leitenden Grundgedanken entsprechend; die
   Darstellung schreitet ernst und gemessen vor und nimmt, obschon in den
   späteren Ausgaben mehr gelehrt als anziehend, mehr auf den Verstand als
   auf das Gemüth berechnet, doch zuweilen einen höheren Schwung an.
   Calvin's Institution enthält Abschnitte, die dem Schönsten, was von
   Pascal und Bossuet geschrieben worden ist, an die Seite gestellt werden
   können: Stellen, wie jene über die Erhabenheit der heiligen Schrift,
   über das Elend des gefallenen Menschen, über die Bedeutung des Gebetes,
   werden nie verfehlen, auf den Leser einen tiefen Eindruck zu machen.
   Auch von den katholischen Gegnern Calvin's sind diese Vorzüge anerkannt
   und manche Abschnitte seines Werkes sogar benutzt worden. Man begreift
   es vollkommen, wenn er selbst mit dem Gefühl der Befriedigung und des
   Stolzes auf sein Werk blickt und in seinen übrigen Schriften gern auf
   das "Lehrbuch" zurückverweist.'

   [854] The full title of the first edition is 'Christia- | næ Religionis
   Insti- | tutio totam fere pietatis summam et quic | quid est in
   doctrina salutis cognitu ne- | cessarium, complectens: omnibus pie- |
   tatis studiosis lectu dignissi- | mum opus, ac re- | cens edi- | tum. |
   Præfatio ad Chri- | stianissimum Regem Franciæ, qua | hic ei liber pro
   confessione fidei | offertur. | Joanne Calvino | Nouiodunensi authore.
   | Basileæ, | M.D.XXXVI.' The dedicatory Preface is dated 'X. Calendas
   Septembres' (i.e. August 23), without the year; but at the close of the
   book the month of March, 1536, is given as the date of publication. The
   first two French editions (1541 and 1545) supplement the date of the
   Preface correctly: 'De Basle le vingt-troysiesme d'Aoust mil cinq cent
   trente cinq.' The manuscript, then, was completed in Aug. 1535, but it
   took nearly a year to print it. The eighth and last improved edition
   from the pen of the author bears the title: 'Institutio Chri- | stianæ
   Religionis, in libros qua- | tuor nunc primum digesta, certisque
   distincta capitibus, ad aptissimam | methodum: aucta etiam tam magna
   accessione ut propemodum opus | novum haberi possit. | Joanne Calvino
   authore. | Oliva Roberti Stephani. | Genevæ. | M.D.LIX.'

   [855] 'In doctrina,' says Beza, towards the close of his Vita Calv.,
   'quam initio tradidit ad extremum constans nihil prorsus immutavit,
   quod paucis nostra memoria theologis contigit.' Bretschneider was quite
   mistaken when he missed in the first edition the doctrine of
   predestination, which is clearly though briefly indicated, pp. 91 and
   138. See Kampschulte, p. 256.

   [856] The Strasburg editors devote the first four volumes to the
   different editions of the Institutes in both languages. Vol. I.
   contains the editio princeps Latina, of Basle, 1536 (pp. 10-247), and
   the variations of six editions intervening between the first and the
   last, viz., the Strasburg editions of 1539, 1543, 1545, and the Geneva
   editions of 1550, 1553, 1554 (pp. 253-1152); Vol. II. the editio
   postrema of 1559 (pp. 1-1118); Vol. III. and IV. the last edition of
   the French translation, or free reproduction rather (1560), with the
   variations of former editions. The question of the priority of the
   Latin or French text is now settled in favor of the former. See Jules
   Bonnet, in the Bulletin de la Société de l'histoire du protestantisme
   français for 1858, Vol. VI. pp. 137 sqq., Stähelin, Vol. I. p. 55, and
   the Strasburg editors of the Opera, in the ample Prolegomena to Vols.
   I. and III. Calvin himself says expressly (in the Preface to his French
   ed. 1541) that he first wrote the Institutes in Latin ('premièrement
   l'ay mis en latin') for readers of all nations, and that he translated
   them afterwards for the special benefit of Frenchmen. In a letter to
   his friend, Francis Daniel, dated Lausanne, Oct. 13, 1536, he writes
   that he began the French translation soon after the publication of the
   Latin (Letters, ed. Bonnet, Vol. I. p. 21), but it did not appear till
   1541, bearing the title 'Institution de la religion Chrestienne
   composée en latin, par Jean Calvin, et translatée en français par
   luymesme.' The erroneous assertion of a French original, so often
   repeated (by Bayle, Maimbourg, Basnage, and more recently by Henry,
   Vol. I. p. 104; III. p. 177; Dorner, Gesch. der protest. Theol. p. 375;
   H. B. Smith, 1.c. p. 283; and Guizot, p. 176, who assumes that the
   first French ed. was published anonymously), arose from confounding the
   date of the Preface in the French editions (23 Aug. 1535) with the
   later date of publication (1536). It is quite possible, however, that
   the dedication to Francis I. was first written in French, and this
   would most naturally account for the earlier date in the French
   editions. On the difference of the several editions, comp. also J.
   Thomas, Histoire de l'instit. chrétienne de J. Calv., Strasb. 1859, and
   Köstlin, Calvin's Institutio nach Form und Inhalt, in the Studien und
   Kritiken for 1868.

   [857] See the Preface in Opera, Vol. IX. pp. 847-850. It is written in
   excellent taste, and with profound respect and affection for
   Melanchthon, whose work, he concludes, 'conduit à la pure verité de
   Dieu, à laquelle it nous convient tenir, nous servant des hommes pour
   nous aider à y parvenir.'

   [858] See the eulogies of Bucer, Beza, Sainte-Marthe, Thurius, Blunt,
   Salmasius, John von Müller, and others, quoted by Henry and Stähelin
   (Vol. I. pp. 59 sqq.). To these may be added some more recent
   testimonies. Guizot says (1.c. p. 173): 'The Institutes were and are
   still the noblest monument of the greatness of mind and originality of
   idea which distinguished Calvin in his own century. More than that, I
   believe this book to be the most valuable and enduring of all his
   labors; for those churches which are specially known as the Reformed
   Churches of France, Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, and the United
   States of America received from Calvin's Institutes the doctrine,
   organization, and discipline which, in spite of sharp trials, grave
   mistakes, and claims which are incompatible with the progress of
   liberty, have still, for more than three centuries, been the source of
   all their strength and vitality.' Hase (in his Kirchengeschichte) calls
   the Institutes 'die grossartigste wissenschaftliche Rechtfertigung des
   Augustinismus voll religiösen Tiefsinns in unerbittlicher
   Folgerichtigkeit der Gedanken.' G. Frank (Gesch. der Protest. Theol.
   Vol. I. p. 74): 'Wie Melanchthon hat auch Calvin seinen Glauben
   zusammengefasst in einem besonderen Werke, der Inst. rel. chr., nur
   methodischer, folgerichtiger, überlegner, die grösste Glaubenslehre des
   16 Jahrh. ist sie wie ein hochgewölbter, dunkler Dom, darin der Ernst
   der Religion in andächtigem Schauer sich über die Seele legt.' H. B.
   Smith (1.c. p. 288): 'It is the most complete system [of theology]
   which the 16th century produced, nor has it been supplanted by any
   single work.' Baur (Dogmengeschichte, Vol. III. p. 27) calls it 'in
   every respect a truly classical work, distinguished in a high degree by
   originality and acuteness of conception, systematic consistency, and
   clear, luminous method.' To many editions of the Institutes the
   well-known distich of the Hungarian Paul Thurius is affixed: 'Præter
   apostolicas post Christi tempora chartas, Huic peperere libro sæcula
   nulla parem.'

   [859] Florimond de Ræmond, Histoire de la naissance, progrez et
   decadence de l'hérésie de ce siècle, pp. 838, 883, quoted by
   Kampschulte (p. 278), who adds: 'Seine Schrift des
   Reformationszeitalters ist von den Katholiken mehr gefürchtet, eifriger
   bekämpft und verfolgt worden, als Calvin's Christliche Institution.'
   See his own judgment quoted on pp. 446 sq., note.

   [860] The first edition of the Institutes contains only six chapters:
   1. De lege, with an explanation of the Decalogue; 2. De fide, with an
   exposition of the Apostles' Creed; 3. De oratione, with an exposition
   of the Lord's Prayer; 4. Of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper; 5. Of the other so-called Sacraments; 6. Of Christian liberty,
   Church-government, and discipline.

   [861] Schleiermacher, the greatest divine of the nineteenth century,
   has defended Calvinism as the only consistent system on the basis of
   the orthodox anthropology and eschatology (though he runs it out into a
   final, unscriptural universalism); and his pupil, Alexander Schweizer,
   of Zurich (in his Glaubenslehre der evang. reform. Kirche, Vol. I. pp.
   79 and 81), thus clearly and sharply states the logical aspect of the
   case: 'Der reformirte Lehrbegriff, consequent gegründet auf das
   Materialprincip schlechthiniger Abhängigkeit von Gott und von da aus
   das menschliche Thun beleuchtend, ohne dessen willensmässige Natur zu
   verkleinern, ist weniger durch seinen Determinismus anstössig geworden,
   als durch das dualistisch Particularistische der auf die Prädestination
   angewandten Weltansicht. Gerade dieses aber gehört der Weltansicht
   aller damaligen Confessionen gleich sehr an and folgt wirklich aus der
   Vorstellung, dass unser ewiges Loos beim irdischen Sterben entschieden
   sei, nur hienieden Erlöste selig werden, alle Andern aber verdammt
   bleiben. . . . Das Harte am reformirten Lehrbegriff ist der
   dualistische Particularismus, der aber allen Confessionen gemein durch
   die reformirte Consequenz nur heller in's Licht gestellt wird, wodurch
   allein, falls er irrig wäre, die Förderung zur Wahrheit angebahnt ist.
   1. Dualistischer Particularismus ist die Idee, dass in der Menschen-
   und Engelwelt die einen selig werden, die andern ewig verdammt. Diess
   war die Ansicht aller kirchlichen Confessionen, indem der
   Universalismus, die Beseligung aller rationalen Kreaturen in allen drei
   Confessionen, als hæretische Irrlehre abgewiesen wurde. 2. Liegt im
   Particularismus Hartes, die Güte Gottes Beschränkendes, so ist es
   ungerecht, darüber nur die reformirte Confession anzugehen, die weiter
   nichts gethan, als gelehrt hat: Das Weltergebniss müsse dem Weltplan
   entsprechen, somit habe Gott ewig grade diese Welt mit diesem Ergebniss
   gewollt und eine particularistische Prädestination bei sich
   beschlossen, wovon nun alle Weltentwicklung einfach die Ansführung sei;
   denn dass alles anders herauskomme, als Gott es gewollt, heisse Gott
   von den Kreaturen abhängig machen, die Kreaturen zu Göttern machen,
   Gott aber zum Ungott.' Comp. also Baur, Dogmengeschichte, Vol. III.
   (1867), pp. 144 sqq.

   [862] 'Præscientiam quum tribuimus Deo, significamus omnia semper
   fuisse ac perpetuo mamere sub ejus oculis; ut ejus notitiæ nihil
   futurum aut præteritum, sed omnia sint præsentia, et sic quidem
   præsentia, ut non ex ideis tantum imaginetur (qualiter nobis
   obversantur ea quorum memoriam mens nostra retinet), sed tanquam ante
   se posita vere intueatur ac cernat. Atque hæc præscientia ad universum
   mundi ambitum et ad omnes creaturas extenditur. Prædestinationem
   vocamus æternum Dei decretum, quo apud se constitutum habuit, quid de
   unoquoque homine fieri vellet. Non enim pari conditione creantur omnes;
   sed aliis vita æterna, aliis damnatio æterna præordinatur. Itaque,
   prout in alterutrum finem quisque conditus est, ita vel ad vitam, vel
   ad mortem prædestinatum dicimus.' Instit. Lib. III. c. 21, § 5 (Opera,
   Vol. II. pp. 682, 683). Comp. his Articuli de prædest., first published
   from an autograph of Calvin, Vol. IX. p. 713.

   [863] 'Iterum quæro, unde factum est ut tot gentes una cum liberis

   nemo poterit quin præsciverit Deus, quem exitum esset habiturus homo,
   antequam ipsum conderet, et ideo præsciverit, quia decreto suo sic
   ordinarat. In præscientiam Dei si quis hic invehatur, temere et
   inconsulte impingit. Quid enim, quæso, est cur reus agatur coelestis
   judex quia non ignoraverit quod futurum erat? In prædestinationem
   competit, si quid est vel justæ vel speciosæ querimoniæ. Nec absurdum
   videri debet quod dico, Deum non modo primi hominis casum, et in eo
   posterorum ruinam prævidisse, sed arbitrio quoque suo dispensasse. Ut
   enim ad ejus sapientiam pertinet, omnium quæ futura sunt esse præscium,
   sic ad potentiam, omnia manu sua regere ac moderari.' Instit. Lib. III.

   censuerat; cur censuerit, nos latet. Certum tamen est non aliter
   censuisse, nisi quia videbat, nominis sui gloriam inde merito

   Justum enim esse oportet quod laudem meretur. Cadit igitur homo, Dei
   providentia sic ordinante, sed suo vitio cadit. . . . Propria ergo
   malitia, quam acceptrat a Domino puram naturam corrupit; sua ruina
   totam posteritatem in exitium secum attraxit.' Instit. Lib. III. c. 23,
   § 8 (Vol. II. p. 705). The difference between the supralapsarians and
   infralapsarians was not agitated at the time of Calvin, but afterwards
   during the Arminian controversy in Holland. Both schools appealed to
   him. The difference is more speculative than moral and practical. In
   creating man free, God created him necessarily temptable and liable to
   fall, but the fall itself is man's own act and abuse of freedom. God
   decreed sin not efficiently but permissively, not as an actual fact but
   as a mere possibility, not for its own sake but for the sake of the
   good or as a negative condition of redemption. Besides, sin has no
   positive character, is no created substance, bat it is privative and
   negative, and consists simply in the abuse of faculties and gifts
   essentially good.

   [865] There is a dispute about the precise meaning of Art. XVII.; but,
   as Prof. Fisher says (The Reform. p. 335), 'the article can not fairly
   be interpreted in any other sense than that of unconditional election;
   and the cautions which are appended, instead of being opposed to this
   interpretation, demonstrate the correctness of it."

   [866] Can. IV.: 'Ita Deus gloriam suam illustrare constituit, ut
   decreverit, primo quidem hominem integrum creare. tum ejusdem lapsum
   permittere, ac demum ex lapsis quorundam misereri, adeoque eosdem
   eligere, alios vero in corrupta massa Relinquere, æternoque tandem
   exitio devovere.' This does not go beyond the limits of Augustinianism.
   Van Oosterzee errs when he says (Christian Dogmatics, Vol. I. p. 452)
   that the Form. Cons. Hel. asserts the supralapsarian view; while Hodge
   errs on the other side when he says (Syst. Theol. Vol. II. p. 317) that
   this document contains 'a formal repudiation of the supralapsarian
   view.'

   [867] Dr. Hodge, who best represents the Old School Calvinism in
   America, rejects supralapsarianism and defends infralapsarianism, which
   he defines thus (Syst. Theol. Vol. II. pp. 319 and 320): 'According to
   the infralapsarian doctrine, God, with the design to reveal his own
   glory--that is, the perfections of his own nature--determined to create
   the world; secondly, to permit the fall of man; thirdly, to elect from
   the mass of fallen men a multitude whom no man could number as "vessels
   of mercy;" fourthly, to send his Son for their redemption; and,
   fifthly, to leave the residue of mankind, as he left the fallen angels,
   to suffer the just punishment of their sins.'

   [868] Calvin taught his view of the Eucharist in the first edition of
   his Institutes (cap. 4, De Sacramentis, pp. 236 sqq., in the new ed. of
   the Opera, Vol. I. pp. 118 sqq.; comp. Ebrard, Das Dogma v. heil.
   Abendmahl, Vol. II. p. 412), and in the Confessio fidei de eucharistia.
   (1537); then more fully in the later editions of the Institutes, 1.c.
   Lib. IV. cap. 17, 18; in his two Catechisms (1538 and 1542); in his
   admirable tract De Coena Domini (first in French, 1541, then in Latin,
   1545; see Opera, Vol. V. pp. 429-460); in the Consensus Tigurinus
   (1549); and he defended it in several polemical treatises against
   Westphal (1555-1557) and Heshusius (1561).

   [869] See, on this whole subject, the very elaborate exposition of
   Ebrard, Das Dogma v. heil. Abendmahl, Vol. II. pp. 402-525; Baur,
   Geschichte der christl. Kirche, Vol. IV. pp. 398-402; and Nevin's
   article on the Reformed Doctrine of the Lord's Supper, in the
   Mercersburg Review for Sept. 1850, pp. 421-548 (in defense of his
   'Mystical Presence'). Dr. Nevin has clearly and correctly stated
   Calvin's doctrine of the Eucharist and abundantly fortified it with
   quotations from all the symbolical standards, in entire harmony with
   Ebrard (who indorsed him in the Studien und Kritiken). After rejecting
   both the dogma of transubstantiation and consubstantiation, he says (p.
   429): 'In opposition to this view, the Reformed Church taught that the
   participation of Christ's flesh and blood in the Lord's Supper is
   spiritual only, and in no sense corporal. The idea of a local presence
   in the case was utterly rejected. The elements can not be said to
   comprehend or include the body of the Saviour in any sense. It is not
   there, but remains constantly in heaven, according to the Scriptures.
   It is not handled by the minister and taken into the mouth of the
   communicant. The manducation of it is not oral, but only by faith. It
   is present in fruition accordingly to believers only in the exercise of
   faith; the impenitent and unbelieving receive only the naked symbols,
   bread and wine, without any spiritual advantage to their own souls.
   Thus we have the doctrine defined and circumscribed on both sides; with
   proper distinction from all that may be considered a tendency to
   Rationalism in one direction, and from all that may be counted a
   tendency to Romanism in the other. It allows the presence of Christ's
   person in the sacrament, including even his flesh and blood, so far as
   the actual participation of the believer is concerned. Even the term
   real presence Calvin tells us he was willing to employ, if it were to
   be understood as synonymous with true presence; by which he means a
   presence that brings Christ truly into communion with the believer in
   his human nature as well as in his divine nature. The word real,
   however, was understood ordinarily to denote a local, corporal
   presence, and on this account was not approved. To guard against this,
   it may be qualified by the word spiritual; and the expression will then
   be quite suitable to the nature of the doctrine as it has been now
   explained. A real presence, in opposition to the notion that Christ's
   flesh and blood are not made present to the communicant in any way. A
   spiritual real presence, in opposition to the idea that Christ's body
   is in the elements in a local or corporal manner. Not real simply, and
   not spiritual simply, but real and yet spiritual at the same time. The
   body of Christ is in heaven, the believer on earth; but by the power of
   the Holy Ghost, nevertheless, the obstacle of such vast local distance
   is fully overcome, so that in the sacramental act, while the outward
   symbols are received in an outward way, the very body and blood of
   Christ are at the same time inwardly and supernaturally communicated to
   the worthy receiver, for the real nourishment of his new life. Not that
   the material particles of Christ's body are supposed to be carried
   over, by this supernatural process, into the believer's person. The
   communion is spiritual, not material. It is a participation of the
   Saviour's life; of his life, however, as human, subsisting in a true
   bodily form. The living energy, the vivific virtue, as Calvin styles
   it, of Christ's flesh, is made to flow over into the communicant,
   making him more and more one with Christ himself, and thus more and
   more an heir of the same immortality that is brought to light in his
   person.'

   [870] In his exposition of Gen. iii. 15, he understands the 'woman's
   seed' collectively of the human family in its perpetual struggle with
   Satan, which at last culminates in the victory of Christ, the head of
   the race. Comp. also his remarks on Isa. iv. 2; vi. 3; Psa. xxxiii. 6;
   Matt. ii. 15; Heb. ii. 6-8.

   [873] John Knox, the Reformer of Scotland, who studied at the feet of
   Calvin, though four years his senior, in a letter to his friend Locke,
   in 1556, called the Church of Geneva 'the most perfect school of Christ
   that ever was in the earth since the days of the Apostles. In other
   places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and religion
   to be so sincerely reformed, I have not yet seen in any other place
   besides.' Farel wrote, in 1557, that he never saw Geneva in such
   excellent condition before, and that he wonld rather be the last there
   than the first any where else. There, it was said, the pure gospel is
   preached in all temples and houses (Calvin himself preached daily,
   every other week); there the music of psalms never ceases; there hands
   are folded and hearts lifted up to heaven from morning till night and
   from night until morning. The Italian refugee, Bernardino Ochino, gives
   a most favorable description of the moral condition of Geneva. See his
   Life by Beurath (1875), p. 169.

   [874] Dr. Valentine Andreæ of Würtemberg (a grandson of Jacob Andreæ,
   the chief author of the Formula of Concord), a great and shining light
   of the Lutheran Church in Germany during the desolations of the
   Thirty-Years' War (d. 1654), visited Geneva in the early part of the
   seventeenth century, and held it up as a model of moral purity well
   worthy of imitation. 'Als ich in Genf war,' he says in his Respublica
   Christianopolitana, 1619, 'bemerkte ich etwas Grosses, woran die
   Erinnerung, ja vielmehr, wonach die Sehnsucht nur mit meinem Leben
   absterben wird. Nicht nur findet sich hier das vollkommene Institut
   einer vollkommenen Republik, sondern als eine besondere Zierde und
   Mittel der Disciplin eine Sittenzucht, nach welcher über die Sitten und
   selbst die geringsten Ueberschreitungen der Bürger wöchentlich
   Untersuchung angestellt wird, zuerst durch die Viertelsinspectoren,
   dann durch die Senioren, endlich durch den Magistrat, je nachdem der
   Frevel der Sache oder die Verhärtung und Verstockung der Schuldigen es
   erfordern. In Folge dessen sind denn alle Fluchworte, alles Würfel- und
   Kartenspiel, Ueppigkeit, Uebermuth, Zank, Hass, Betrug, Luxus, u.s.w.,
   geschweige denn grössere Vergehungen, die fast unerhört sind,
   untersagt. Welche herrliche Zierde für die christliche Religion solche
   Sittenreinheit, vor der wir mil allen Thränen beweinen müssen, dass sie
   uns fehlt und fast ganz venachlässigt wird, und alle Gutgesinnten sich
   anstrengen, dass sie in's Leben gerufen werde! Mich, wofern mich die
   Verschiedenheit der Religion nicht abgehalten, hätte die sittliche
   Uebereinstimmung hier auf ewig gefesselt, und mit allem Eifer habe ich
   von da an getrachtet, dass etwas Aehnliches auch unserer Kirche zu
   Theil würde. Nicht geringer als die öffentliche Zucht war auch die
   häusliche meines Hausherrn Scarron ausgezeichnet durch stetige
   Gebetsübungen, Lectüre der heiligen Schrift, Gottesfurcht in Worten und
   Thaten, Masshalten in Speise und Kleidung, dass ich eine grössere
   Sittenreinheit selbst im väterlichen Hause nicht gesehen.'

   [875] The Haldanes repaid the debt of Scotland to Geneva, and, in
   connection with Cesar Malan, gave the first impulse to a revival which
   resulted in the establishment of a Free Church, and a school of
   theology distinguished by the labors of Gaussen, Merle d'Aubigné,
   Pronier, La Harpe. The old National Church which Calvin founded has
   likewise undergone a salutary change, though the old rigor can never be
   restored. In point of literary culture and social refinement, Geneva
   always retained the first rank among French cities next to Paris.

   Kirche: Gott im Himmel. In seinem Namen herrscht jede irdische Gewalt.
   Gottes Herrscherruhm zu verkündigen, seine Majestät zu verherrlichen,
   seinen heiligen Willen zur Ausführung zu bringen und seine Bekenner zu
   heiligen, ist die gemeinsame Aufgabe von Staat und Kirche.' Comp.
   Stähelin, Vol. I. pp. 319 sqq.

   [878] Guizot says of this ecclesiastical organization (p. 265): 'In its
   origin it was a profoundly Christian and evangelical system; it was
   republican in many of its fundamental principles and practices, and at
   the same time it recognized the necessity of authority and order, and
   originated general and permanent rules of discipline.' Michelet calls
   the Geneva of Calvin 'the city of the spirit, founded by Stoicism on
   the rock of predestination;' and Kampschulte (p. 430), 'the metropolis
   of a grand, sublime, and terrible idea.'

   [879] See the acts of the process of Servetus at Vienne and Lyons
   (first published by the Abbé d'Artigny, Paris, 1749), in Calvin's

   [880] For full discussion of the trial and execution of Servetus and
   Calvin's part in them, see Schaff: Ch. Hist., VII., 680-793. A large
   boulder has been placed by Swiss and French Protestants at the spot
   where the Spaniard suffered, to serve as an expiatory monument,
   expressing regret for the tragedy and at the same time respect for
   Calvin. On the one side is the record that Michael Servetus of
   Villeneuve, Aragon, b., Sept. 29, 1511, was executed there, Oct. 26,
   1553, and on the other the inscription: Fils respectueux et
   reconnaissants de Calvin, notre grand Réformateur, mais condamnant une
   erreur qui fut celle de son siècle et fermement attachés à la liberté
   de conscience selon les vrais principes de la Réformation et de
   l'Evangile nous avons élevé ce monument expiatoire, le 27 Octobre,
   1903. (We, respectful children of Calvin, our great Reformer, but
   condemning an error which was the error of his age and firmly attached
   to liberty of conscience according to the true principles of the
   Reformation and the Gospel, have erected this expiatory monument, Oct.
   27, 1903). Calvin was called by Renan "the most Christian man of his
   age."--Ed.

   [881] It may he questioned whether Zwingli and Luther, had they lived,
   would have sanctioned the execution; their impulses at least were more
   liberal. With all his polemic violence in argument, Luther disapproved
   of the shocking cruelties against the Anabaptists in Germany, and said
   that 'on this plan, the hangman would be the best theologian.'

   The commanding influence of Calvin's theology and Church polity is
   manifest in all the leading confessions of the Reformed Churches,
   especially the French, Dutch, and Scotch, also in the Lambeth Articles,
   the Irish Articles, and the Westminster Standards. But the confessions
   which he himself prepared were intended, like those of Zwingli, for
   local and temporary rather than general purposes, and possess only a
   secondary authority. These are the Geneva Catechism, the Zurich
   Consensus, and the Geneva Consensus. [882]

   Calvin, like Luther and other Reformers, did not consider it beneath
   his dignity, but rather a duty and a privilege, to utilize his profound
   learning for the benefit of children by adapting it to their
   simplicity. He made general education and catechetical instruction the
   basis of the republic. [883]

   During his first residence at Geneva (1536), he prepared a catechism,
   in the French language, together with a form of discipline, as a basis
   of instruction for the newly reformed Church of that city. [884] It is
   a brief summary of the Christian religion, a popular extract from his
   'Institutes.' It treats, in fifty-eight sections (but not in the form
   of question and answer), of the religious constitution of man, the
   distinction between false and true religion, the knowledge of God, the
   original state of man, free-will, sin and death, the way of salvation,
   the law of God, the Ten Commandments, the sum of the law (Matt. xxii.
   37), the aim of the law, faith in Christ, election and predestination,
   the nature of faith, justification and sanctification, repentance and
   regeneration, faith and good works, an exposition of the articles of
   the Apostles' Creed, and the petitions of the Lord's Prayer, the
   sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, the Church, human
   traditions, excommunication, and the civil magistrate. Then follows a
   short confession of faith, in twenty-one articles, extracted from the
   Catechism, which was to be binding upon all the citizens of
   Geneva--probably the first instance of a formal pledge to a symbolical
   book in the history of the Reformed Church. [885]

   After his return from Strasburg Calvin rewrote the Catechism on a
   larger scale, and arranged in questions and answers: the catechist
   drawing out the information, and the pupil or child seeming to teach
   the master. It was prepared in great haste, for the printer demanded
   copy without giving him time to revise it. He often desired to perfect
   the book, but found no time. [886] It appeared in French, 1541 or 1542,
   [887] in Latin, 1545, [888] and very often. It was also translated into
   Italian (1551 and 1556), Spanish (1550), English (1556), German, Dutch,
   Hungarian, even into Greek and Hebrew. [889] It was used for a long
   time in Reformed Churches and schools, especially in France and
   Scotland, and served a good purpose in promoting an intelligent piety
   and virtue on the solid basis of systematic Biblical instruction.
   Educational religion, which grows with our growth, is the most
   substantial, and must ever be the main reliance of the Church.

   The object of this work, as explained in the preface, was to restore
   the catechetical instruction of the ancient Church, so sadly neglected
   by the Papists, who substituted for it the ceremony of confirmation,
   and to secure greater unity of faith and doctrine in the scattered
   Reformed congregations. Calvin showed his churchly tact in making the
   Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer the basis.
   The leading idea is man's relation to God, and his heavenly
   destination. The whole is divided into five parts, as follows: 1. Of
   Faith--an exposition of the Creed (which here, as in the Heidelberg
   Catechism, precedes the Ten Commandments, while in the earlier
   Catechism of Calvin the opposite order was observed); [890] 2. Of the
   Law, or the Ten Commandments; 3. Of Prayer; 4. Of the Word of God; 5.
   Of the Sacraments. In the French edition the Catechism is divided into
   fifty-five lessons, for the fifty-two Sundays of the year and the three
   great festivals--a method followed in the later editions of the
   Heidelberg Catechism. [891]

   Calvin's Catechism is fuller than Luther's, but less popular and
   childlike. It prepared the way and furnished material for a number of
   similar works, which have gradually superseded it, especially the
   Anglican (Nowell's), the Heidelberg, and the Westminster Catechisms.
   The Anglican Catechism is much shorter and more churchly in taking its
   starting-point from Baptism. The first question of the Westminster
   Catechism makes the glory of God 'the chief end of man,' and is a happy
   condensation of the first three questions of Calvin. [892] The
   Heidelberg Catechism begins more subjectively with 'the only comfort of
   man in life and in death,' herein betraying its German origin; but this
   also was suggested by the next questions of Calvin concerning the
   highest good or felicity of man and the firm foundation of our
   salvation. Otherwise the Heidelberg Catechism adheres to the order of
   the Genevan more closely than the Westminster, by retaining, as a basis
   of the dogmatic section, the Apostles' Creed (which the Westminster
   Catechism merely adds as an appendix). [893]

   Guizot gives the preference to Calvin's Catechism over those modern
   ones which begin with speculative questions on the nature and existence
   of God. 'Calvin,' he says, [894] 'proceeds in a very different manner;
   he does not seek God--he knows him, possesses him, and takes God as his
   starting-point. God the Creator, man his creature, and the relation of
   man to God--these form the fundamental facts and natural basis of the
   history, doctrines, and laws of Christianity. Calvin's Catechism
   commences thus: "What is the chief end of human life?" "To know God."
   And this first assertion is the mainspring of all the principles and
   religious duties which are afterwards presented, not as the discoveries
   of the human mind, but as communications made by God in order to meet
   man's aspirations, and enable him to regulate his life. It is neither a
   scientific method, nor is the Catechism a philosophical work; it
   contains the assertion of a real, immemorial, universal, and historical
   fact, and explains the consequences of that fact. It is the natural and
   legitimate method of imparting religions instruction, inherent in the
   very first principle of all religion; it is especially in harmony with
   the origin and history of Christianity, and no one has ever recognized
   its power or proved its efficacy more fully than Calvin.'

   with the magistrate. It seems to have been drawn up before the
   Catechism, immediately after the disputation at Lausanne, for Beza
   says: 'Tunc edita est a Calvino Christianæ doctrinæ quædam veluti

   [890] He made the Apostles' Creed the basis of his 'Catechism' and
   'Institutes,' not because he believed it to be literally the product of
   the Apostles, but because it is a faithful summary of their teaching
   ('ex eorum scriptis fideliter collecta,' 'tiré de la pure doctrine
   apostolique'), and a formula which best expresses the common Christian
   faith ('formula confessionis, quam inter se communem habent Christiani
   omnes').

   [891] The distribution into Sundays appears first in the French edition

   Calvin is also responsible for the unhistorical interpretation of
   Christ's descent into Hades, by which he understood the anticipation of
   the sufferings of hell in Gethsemane and on the Cross. This is quite
   inconsistent with the position of this article between the burial and
   the resurrection. Ihe Westminster Catechism falls into another error by
   making it mean simply, 'He continued in the state of the dead and under
   the power of death till the third day.'

   112-124.


   In the sacramental controversy--the most violent, distracting, and
   unprofitable in the history of the Reformation--Calvin stood midway
   between Luther and Zwingli, and endeavored to unite the elements of
   truth on both sides, in his theory of a spiritual real presence and
   fruition of Christ by faith. [895] This satisfied neither the rigid
   Lutherans nor the rigid Zwinglians. The former could see no material
   difference between Calvin and Zwingli, since both denied the literal
   interpretation of 'this is my body,' and a corporeal presence and
   manducation. The latter suspected Calvin of leaning towards Lutheran
   consubstantiation and working into the hands of Bucer, who had made
   himself obnoxious by his facile compromises and ill-concealed
   concessions to the Lutheran view in the Wittenberg Concordia (1536).

   The wound was reopened by Luther's fierce attack on the Zwinglians
   (1545), and their sharp reply. Calvin was displeased with both parties,
   and counselled moderation. It was very desirable to harmonize the
   teaching of the Swiss Churches. Bullinger, who first advanced beyond
   the original Zwinglian ground, and appreciated the deeper theology of
   Calvin, sent him his book on the Sacraments, in manuscript (1546), with
   the request to express his opinion. Calvin, did this with great
   frankness, and a degree of censure which at first irritated Bullinger.
   Then followed a correspondence and personal conference at Zurich, which
   resulted in a complete union of the Calvinistic and Zwinglian sections
   of the Swiss Churches on this vexed subject. The negotiations reflect
   great credit on both parties, and reveal an admirable spirit of
   frankness, moderation, forbearance, and patience, which triumphed over
   all personal sensibilities and irritations. [896]

   The first draft of the Consensus Tigurinus, from November, 1548,
   consists of twenty-four brief propositions drawn up by Calvin, with
   annotations by Bullinger, to which Calvin responded in January, 1549.
   They assert that the Sacraments are not in and of themselves effective
   and conferring grace, but that God, through the Holy Spirit, acts
   through them as means; that the internal effect appears only in the
   elect; that the good of the Sacraments consists in leading us to
   Christ, and being instruments of the grace of God, which is sincerely
   offered to all; that in baptism we receive the remission of sins,
   although this proceeds primarily not from baptism, but from the blood
   of Christ; that in the Lord's Supper we eat and drink the body and
   blood of Christ, not, however, by means of a carnal presence of
   Christ's human nature, which is in heaven, but by the power of the Holy
   Spirit and the devout elevation of our soul to heaven. [897]

   In the month of March Calvin sent twenty Articles to the Synod of
   Berne, [898] but in this canton there was strong opposition to Calvin's
   rigorism, which subsided only after his death. [899]

   In May, 1549, he had, in company with Farel, a personal interview with
   Bullinger in Zurich at his cordial invitation, and drew up the
   Consensus as it now stands, in Twenty-six Articles. It was published in
   1551 at Zurich and at Geneva. [900] It contains the Calvinistic
   doctrine, adjusted as nearly as possible to the Zwinglian in its
   advanced form, but with a disturbing predestinarian restriction of the
   sacramental grace to the elect. [901] The truth of the Zwinglian view
   is fully acknowledged in opposition to transubstantiation and
   consubstantiation, but the real life union with Christ in the sacrament
   is as clearly asserted, and made still more plain in the 'Exposition'
   of the Consensus which Calvin wrote four years afterwards (1554). 'The
   Sacraments,' he declares, 'are helps and media (adminicula et media),
   by which we are either inserted into the body of Christ, or being so
   inserted coalesce with it more and more, till he unites us with himself
   in full in the heavenly life. . . . The Sacraments are neither empty
   figures, nor outward badges merely of piety, but seals of the promises
   of God, attestations of spiritual grace for cherishing and confirming
   faith, organs also by which God efficaciously works in his elect.'
   [902]

   The Consensus was adopted by the Churches of Zurich, Geneva, St. Gall,
   Schaffhausen, the Grisons, Neuchatel, and, after some hesitation, by
   Basle, and was favorably received in France, England, and parts of
   Germany. Melanchthon declared to Lavater (Bullinger's son-in-law) that
   he then for the first time understood the Swiss, and would never again
   write against them; but he erased those passages of the Consensus which
   made the efficacy of the sacrament depend on election.

   While the Consensus brought peace and harmony to the Swiss Churches, it
   was violently assailed by Joachim Westphal, of Hamburg (1552), in the
   interest of the ultra-Lutheran party in Germany, and became the
   innocent occasion of the second sacramental war, which has been noticed
   in the section on the Formula Concordiæ. [903]

   Calvin's doctrine of predestination [904] met with strong opposition,
   which drew from him some able defenses.

   The first assault came from an eminent Roman Catholic divine, Albertus
   Pighius, 1542, who taught the freedom of will almost to the extent of
   Pelagianism, and conditioned predestination by foreknowledge. [905]
   Calvin wrote a reply to the first part (1543), and dedicated it to
   Melanchthon, who in the second article of the Augsburg Confession had
   expressed the Augustinian doctrine of total depravity. [906]

   A more troublesome opponent was Jerome Bolsec, formerly a Carmelite
   monk from Paris, then a fugitive Protestant and physician at Geneva and
   Lausanne, a restless and turbulent spirit. He denounced Calvin's
   doctrine of predestination as godless and blasphemous, and tried to
   break down his influence, but was publicly refuted and admonished, and
   at last expelled from Geneva (1551) and from Berne (1555). He returned
   to France and to the Roman Church (1563), and thirteen years after
   Calvin's death he took cruel revenge by a shameless and malignant libel
   (1577 and 1588), long since refuted. [907]

   These attacks were the occasion of the Consensus Genevensis, which
   first appeared at Geneva, 1552, in the name of the pastors of that
   city. Calvin contemptuously alludes in the preface to Bolsec, but
   without naming him, and directs his attack mainly against Pighius
   (whose doctrine of predestination he had not noticed in the previous
   work), and a certain Georgius of Sicily (whom he calls an ignorant
   monk, more deserving of contempt than persecution). The Consensus is,
   in fact, the second part of his controversial treatise against Pighius
   (the first being devoted to free-will). It is an elaborate theological
   argument for the doctrine of absolute predestination, as the only solid
   ground of comfort to the believer, but is disfigured by polemical
   violence, and hence unsuited for a public confession. It received the
   signatures of the pastors of Geneva on account of the disturbances
   created by Bolsec, but was not intended to be binding for future
   generations. Beyond Geneva it acquired no symbolical authority. The
   attempt to enlist the civil government in favor of this dogma created
   dissatisfaction and opposition in Berne, Basle, and Zurich. Several of
   Calvin's old friends withdrew; Bullinger counseled peace and
   moderation; Fabri, of Neuchatel, declared the decree of reprobation
   untenable; Melanchthon, who in the mean time had changed his view on
   free-will and predestination, wrote to Peucer that Geneva attempted to
   restore Stoic fatalism, and imprisoned men for not agreeing with Zeno.
   [908]

   The dissatisfaction was increased and the matter complicated by the
   trial and execution of Servet which soon followed (1553), and by the
   controversy with Castellio, which involved likewise the doctrine of
   predestination, together with the question of inspiration and the
   canon. Sebastian Castellio [909] (1515-1563), a convert from Romanism,
   a classical philologist of unusual ability and learning, an advocate of
   toleration, and a forerunner of Socinianism and Rationalism, was
   received by Calvin into his house at Strasburg (1510), and called by
   him to the head of the college at Geneva (Sept., 1541), but was refused
   admission to the clergy on account of his 'profane view' of the
   Canticles, which he regarded as a sensual love-song. [910] These and
   other theological differences caused his resignation or dismissal from
   the school, though with an honorable letter of recommendation from
   Calvin (Feb. 17, 1545). He removed with his family to Basle, and spent
   there the remainder of his life--for eight years in great poverty,
   supporting himself by literary and manual labor, then as professor of
   Greek in the University (since 1553). His principal work is a Latin
   translation of the Bible (1551), which was much praised and censured
   for its pedantic Ciceronian elegance. He attacked Calvin and the Church
   of Geneva very bitterly in anonymous and pseudonymous books, to which
   Calvin and Beza replied with equal bitterness. In his 'Dialogue on
   Predestination,' he charges Calvin with making God the author of sin,
   and dividing the will of God into two contradictory wills. His own view
   is that all men are alike created in God's image and for salvation, and
   are by nature the sons and heirs of God; but that final salvation
   depends upon faith and perseverance. God loves even his enemies, else
   he could not command us to love them, and would be worse than the wild
   beast, which loves its own offspring. God's foreknowledge involves no
   necessity of human actions: things happen, not because God foreknew
   them, but God foreknew them because they were to happen. God wills a
   thing because it is right, and not vice versa. He reasons as if there
   were an established moral order outside and independent of God. He
   compares God to a musician who unites two tunes because they harmonize.
   Christ came as a physician to heal all the sick, and if some remain
   sick it is because they refuse the medicine. The famous passage about
   Jacob and Esau (Rom. ix.) does not refer to these individuals (for
   Jacob never served Esau), but to the nations which proceeded from them;
   and 'to hate' means only 'to love less;' moreover, Esau was not
   foreordained to sell his birthright, but he did this by his own guilt.
   Paul himself says that God will have all men to be saved, and that 'he
   concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.'
   Castellio died a few months before Calvin, without leaving a school
   behind him; but his ideas were afterwards more fully developed by the
   Socinians and Arminians. [911]

   Notwithstanding these difficulties, the doctrine of predestination made
   headway in the Reformed Church. It was strongly advocated in Zurich by
   Peter Martyr. His opponent, Theodor Bibliander (Buchmann), a
   distinguished Orientalist, 'the father of exegetical theology in
   Switzerland,' and a forerunner of Arminianism, was removed from his
   professorship of Hebrew on account of his advocacy of free-will (1560),
   though his salary was continued to his death (1564). [912] The dogma of
   predestination consolidated the Calvinistic creed, as the dogma of
   consubstantiation consolidated the Lutheran creed. Both these
   distinctive dogmas maintained their hold on the two Churches until the
   theological revolution towards the close of the eighteenth century
   began to undermine the whole fabric of Protestant orthodoxy and to
   clear the way for new creations.

   fact that the blind zeal of modern Romanism has repeatedly republished
   the libel of Bolsec, with its wicked and absurd charges of theft,
   adultery, unnatural crimes, blasphemy, insanity, and invocations of the
   devil. See Audin's biography of Calvin, which has gone through six
   editions in French (also translated into German and English), and

   [908] Bullinger prepared, March, 1553, for an English friend (Barthol.
   Traheron), a tract, whose title indicates his partial dissent from
   Calvin: 'De providentia Dei ejusque prædestinatione, et quod Deus non
   sit auctor peccati, . . . in quo quæ in Calvini formulis loquendi circa
   hæc improbet, candide et copiose satis exponit, 3 Mart. 1553.'
   (Appended by mistake to Peter Martyr's Loci communes, Gen. 1626. See
   the extracts of Schweizer from a MS. copy in Zurich, Centraldogmen,
   Vol. I. pp. 266 sqq.). Bullinger disapproved of the supralapsarian
   assertion, 'Deum non modo ruinam (lapsum) prævidisse sed etiam arbitrio
   suo dispensasse.' Nevertheless, he called Peter Martyr, who was a
   strict predestinarian, to Zurich, took sides with Zanchi in the
   Strasburg controversy, and expressed the infralapsarian view in the
   Second Helvetic Confession, Art. X. See J. H. Hottinger, Histor.

   The Helvetic Consensus Formula (Formula Consensus Helvetica) is the
   last doctrinal Confession of the Reformed Church of Switzerland, and
   closes the period of Calvinistic creeds. It has been called a
   'symbolical after-birth.' It was composed in 1675, one hundred and
   eleven years after Calvin's death, by Professor John Henry Heidegger,
   of Zurich (1633-1698), [913] at the request and with the co-operation
   of the Rev. Lucas Gernler, of Basle (d. 1675), and Professor Francis
   Turretin, of Geneva (1623-1687). [914] It never extended its authority
   beyond Switzerland, but it is nevertheless a document of considerable
   importance and interest in the history of Protestant theology. It is a
   defense of the scholastic Calvinism of the Synod of Dort against the
   theology of Saumur (Salmurium), especially against the universalism of
   Amyraldus. Hence it may be called a formula anti-Salmuriensis, or
   anti-Amyraldensis.

   THE SYNOD OF DORT AND THE THEOLOGY OF SAUMUR.

   The Twenty-third National Synod of the Reformed Church in France, held
   at Alais, Oct. 1, 1620, adopted the Canons of Dort (1619), as being in
   full harmony with the Word of God and the French Confession of 1559,
   and bound all ministers and elders by a solemn oath to defend them to
   the last breath. The Twenty-fourth National Synod at Charenton,
   September, 1623, reaffirmed this adoption. [915]

   But in the theological academy at Saumur, founded by the celebrated
   Reformed statesman Du Plessis Mornay (1604), there arose a more liberal
   school, headed by three contemporary professors--Josué de la Pace
   (Placeus, 1596-1655), Louis Cappel (Capellus, 1585-1658), and Moyse
   Amyraut (Moses Amyraldus, 1596-1664)--which, without sympathizing with
   Arminianism, departed from the rigid orthodoxy then prevailing in the
   Lutheran and Reformed Churches on three points--the verbal inspiration
   of the Scriptures, the particular predestination, and the imputation of
   Adam's sin.

   Saumur acquired under these leaders great celebrity, and attracted many
   students from Switzerland. It became for the Reformed Church of France
   what Helmstädt, under the lead of Calixtus, was for the Lutheran Church
   in Germany; and the Helvetic Consensus Formula of Heidegger may be
   compared to the 'Consensus repetitus' of Calovius (1664), which was
   intended to be a still more rigorous symbolical protest against
   Syncretism, although it failed to receive any public recognition. [916]

   The further development of the Saumur theology was arrested by the
   political oppression which culminated in the cruel revocation of the
   Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. (1685), and aimed at the utter
   annihilation of the Reformed Church in France. But its ideas have
   silently made progress, and were independently revived in more recent
   times.

   VERBAL INSPIRATION.

   Louis Cappel, the most distinguished of an eminent Huguenot family, and
   one of the first Biblical scholars of the seventeenth century, made the
   history of the text of the Hebrew Scriptures his special study, and
   arrived at conclusions which differed from the orthodox theory of a
   literal inspiration. He discovered and proved that the Hebrew system of
   vocalization did not date from Adam, nor from Moses, nor from Ezra and
   the Great Synagogue, but from the Jewish grammarians after the
   completion of the Babylonian Talmud. [917] This view is confirmed by
   the absence of vowels on Jewish coins, on the Phoenician and Punic
   monuments, on the inscription of the Moabite stone (discovered 1868),
   and by the analogy of the other Semitic languages. Cappel unsettled
   also the traditional view of the literal integrity and sacredness of
   the Masoretic text, and showed that the different readings (Keri and
   Ktib}, while they had no bearing on faith and morals, and therefore
   could not undermine the authority of the Scriptures, are not to be
   traced to willful corruption, but must be consulted, together with the
   ancient translations, in ascertaining the true text. [918]

   These views, which are now generally accepted among Biblical scholars,
   met with violent opposition. Even the Buxtorfs, father and son, at
   Basle, who immortalized themselves by their rabbinical learning,
   advocated the divine inspiration of the Hebrew vowels. The Protestant
   orthodoxy of the seventeenth century, both Calvinistic and Lutheran,
   was very sensitive on this point, because it substituted an infallible
   Bible for an infallible papacy; while the Roman orthodoxy cared much
   more for the divine authority of the Church than for that of the
   Scriptures.

   UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR PREDESTINATION.

   Moses Amyraut, originally a lawyer, but converted to the study of
   theology by the reading of Calvin's 'Institutes,' an able divine and
   voluminous writer, developed the doctrine of hypothetical or
   conditional universalism, for which his teacher, John Cameron
   (1580-1625), a Scotchman, and for two years Professor at Sanmur, had
   prepared the way. His object was not to set aside, but to moderate and
   liberalize Calvinism by ingrafting this doctrine upon the particularism
   of election, and thereby to fortify it against the objections of
   Romanists, by whom the French Protestants were surrounded and
   threatened. Being employed by the Reformed Synod in important
   diplomatic negotiations with the government, he came in frequent
   contact with bishops, and with Cardinal Richelieu, who esteemed him
   highly. His system is an approach, not so much to Arminianism, which he
   decidedly rejected, as to Lutheranism, which likewise teaches a
   universal atonement and a limited election. [919]

   Amyraut maintained the Calvinistic premises of an eternal
   foreordination and foreknowledge of God, whereby he caused all things
   inevitably to pass--the good efficiently, the bad permissively. [920]
   He also admitted the double decree of election and reprobation. But in
   addition to this he taught that God foreordained a universal salvation
   through the universal sacrifice of Christ offered to all alike
   (également pour tous), on condition of faith, so that on the part of
   God's will and desire (voluntas, velleitas, affectus) the grace is
   universal, but as regards the condition it is particular, or only for
   those who do not reject it and thereby make it ineffective. The
   universal redemption scheme precedes the particular election scheme,
   and not vice versa. He reasons from the benevolence of God towards his
   creatures; Calvinism reasons from the result, and makes actual facts
   interpret the decrees. Amyraut distinguished between objective grace
   which is offered to all, and subjective grace in the heart which is
   given only to the elect. He also makes a distinction between natural
   ability and moral ability, or the power to believe and the willingness
   to believe; man possesses the former, but not the latter, in
   consequence of inherent depravity. [921] He was disposed, like Zwingli,
   to extend the grace of God beyond the limits of the visible Church,
   inasmuch as God by his general providence operates upon the heathen,
   and may produce in them a sort of unconscious Christianity, a faith
   without knowledge; while within the Church he operates more fully and
   clearly through the means of grace. Those who never heard of Christ are
   condemned if they reject the general grace of providence; but the same
   persons would also reject Christ if he were offered to them. As regards
   the result, Amyraut agreed with the particularists. His ideal
   universalism is unavailable, except for those in whom God previously
   works the condition of faith, that is, for those who are included in
   the particular decree of election. [922]

   Amyraut's doctrine created a great commotion in the Reformed Churches
   of France, Holland, and Switzerland. Jean Daillé (1594-1670), [923]
   David Blondel (1591-1655), [924] and others considered it innocent and
   consistent with the decrees of the Synod of Dort, where German Reformed
   and Anglican delegates professed similar views against the
   supralapsarianism of Gomarus. But Peter du Moulin (Molinæus, since 1621
   Professor of the rival theological school of Sedan), Frederick Spanheim
   (1600-1649, Professor in Leyden), Andrew Rivet (1572-1651, Professor in
   Leyden), and the theologians of Geneva opposed it as a departure from
   the orthodox faith and a compromise between Calvinism and Arminianism.
   [925]

   The friends of Amyraut urged the love, benevolence, and impartial
   justice of God, and the numerous passages in Scripture which teach that
   God loves 'the whole world,' that he will have 'all men to be saved,'
   that Christ died 'not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the
   whole world,' that 'he shut up all in unbelief that he might have mercy
   upon all.' On the other hand, it was objected that God could not really
   will and intend what is never accomplished; that he could not purpose
   an end without providing adequate means; that, in point of fact, God
   did not actually offer salvation to all; and that a universalism based
   on an impossible condition is an unfruitful abstraction. [926]

   The national Synods at Alençon, 1637; at Charenton, 1645; and at
   Loudun, 1659 (the last synod permitted by the French Government),
   decided wisely and moderately, saving the orthodoxy of Amyraut, and
   guarding only against misconceptions. He gave the assurance that he did
   not change the doctrine, but only the method of instruction. And his
   opponents were forced at last to admit that the idea of a universal
   grace, by which no one was actually saved unless included in the
   particular, effective decree of election, was quite harmless. In this
   way universalism and particularism were equally sanctioned, and a
   schism in the French Church was avoided. [927] The literary controversy
   continued for several years longer, and developed a large amount of
   learning and ability, until it was brought to an abrupt close by the
   political oppressions of the Reformed Church in France. [928]

   MEDIATE AND IMMEDIATE IMPUTATION [929]

   All Augustinians and Calvinists agree in the doctrine of total
   depravity and original sin in consequence of Adam's fall; but
   differences arose among them concerning the imputation of Adam's sin
   and guilt to his posterity. The majority advocated the realistic theory
   of an actual, though impersonal and unconscious, participation of the
   whole human race in the fall of Adam as their natural organic head, who
   by his individual transgression vitiated the generic human nature, and
   transmitted it in this corrupt state by physical generation to his
   descendants. This, the old Augustinian view, was renewed by the
   Reformers. Others, since the seventeenth century, adopted the federal
   theory of a vicarious legal representation of mankind by Adam, in
   virtue of an assumed covenant of works made with him by the Sovereign
   Creator, to the effect that Adam should stand a moral probation in
   behalf of all his descendants (acting like a guardian for children yet
   unborn, or like a representative for future constituents), and that his
   act of obedience or disobedience, with all its consequences, should be
   judicially imputed to them, or accounted theirs in law. [930] Still
   others combined the two theories so as to make imputation rest both on
   the moral ground of participation and on the legal ground of
   representation.

   In connection with this doctrine of hereditary sin there arose among
   the Calvinists of the seventeenth century a controversy about immediate
   or antecedent, and mediate or consequent imputation. [931] The theory
   of immediate imputation makes all descendants of Adam responsible for
   his disobedience as participants in actu, and condemns them
   independently of, and prior to, native depravity and personal
   transgression, so that hereditary guilt precedes hereditary sin. The
   theory of mediate imputation makes inherent depravity derived from
   Adam, and this alone, the ground of imputation and condemnation
   (vitiositas præcedit imputationem). The school of Montauban, Rivet of
   Leyden, the elder Turretin of Geneva, Heidegger of Zurich, Garissol,
   Maresius, and the supralapsarians and federalists advocated the former,
   some exclusively, some in connection with mediate imputation. La Place
   (Placeus) of Saumur denied immediate imputation of a foreign sin as
   arbitrary and unjust, and allowed only a mediate imputation, but
   claimed to be nevertheless in full harmony with Calvin's teaching on
   this subject.

   The Reformed national Synod at Charenton, near Paris, in 1645, rejected
   the theory of La Place (yet without calling him to an account or naming
   him), at least so far as it restricts the nature of original sin to the
   mere hereditary corruption of Adam's posterity. In vindication of the
   decree of the Synod, Rivet prepared a collection of passages on
   imputation (many of them very general and inconclusive) from Reformed
   and Lutheran confessions and the writings of Calvin, Beza, Bullinger,
   Melanchthon, Chemnitz, and others.

   THE CONSENSUS FORMULA.

   Several years after the leaders of the Saumur theology had passed from
   the stage of history it was thought desirable by some of the prominent
   divines of Switzerland to protect their Churches against possible
   danger from the new doctrines of Saumur, which were imported through
   writings and students, and met with considerable sympathy, especially
   in Geneva. It was feared--and not without reason-- that, however
   innocent in themselves, they might lead, by legitimate logical
   development, to an ultimate abandonment of the system of Calvinism.

   Hence the new Formula of orthodoxy which forms the subject of this
   section, was agreed upon by the ecclesiastical and civil authorities of
   Zurich, Basle, and Geneva, and adopted in other Reformed cantons as a
   binding rule of public teaching for ministers and professors. Its
   authority was confined to Switzerland, and even there it could not
   maintain itself longer than about half a century. French ministers, who
   fled to Lausanne after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, refused
   to sign it; the great Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg (1686),
   and afterwards the Kings of Prussia and England, and the Corpus
   Evangelicorum at Ratisbon (1722), urged the Reformed cantons, in the
   interest of peace and union, to abandon the Formula. It gradually lost
   its hold upon the Swiss churches, and was allowed to die and be buried
   without mourners. Nevertheless the theology which it represents
   continues to be advocated by a respectable school of strict Calvinists
   in Europe, and especially in America.

   The Helvetic Consensus Formula was not so much intended to be a new
   confession of faith, as an explanatory appendix to the former
   Confessions (resembling in this respect the Saxon Visitation Articles,
   which were an appendix to the Lutheran Formula of Concord, to guard the
   churches of Saxony against the dangers of crypto-Calvinism). The
   document does not breathe the fresh and bracing air of faith and
   religious experience which characterize the Confessions of the
   Reformation period. It is the product of scholasticism, which
   formularized the faith of Calvin into a stiff doctrinal system, and
   anxiously surrounded it with high walls to keep out the light of
   freedom and progress. Nevertheless it is more liberal than is generally
   represented and than might be expected from the bigotry and polemical
   violence of the seventeenth century. Heidegger was personally mild and
   modest; he spoke the truth in love, and resisted the pressure of
   extremists in Switzerland and Holland, who suspected even him of
   unsoundness, and desired a formal condemnation of the schools not only
   of Saumur but also of Cocceius and Cartesius. Instead of this, he
   speaks in the preface of the Formula, respectfully and kindly, of the
   Saumur theologians, and calls them venerable brethren in Christ, who
   built on the same foundation of faith, and whose peculiar doctrines are
   not condemned as heresies, but simply disapproved. [932]

   The Formula consists of a preface and twenty-six canons or articles,
   which clearly state the points of difference between strict Calvinism
   and Salmurianism. They teach the following points:

   1. The literal inspiration of the Scriptures and the integrity of the
   traditional Hebrew text of the Old Testament, including the vowels as
   well as consonants; so that we need not resort to manuscripts,
   translations, and conjectures. [933] Art. 1-3. Against Cappel.

   This attempt to canonize the Hebrew vowels gave great offense to
   Claude, Daillé, and other French Calvinists; and Heidegger explained to
   Turretin that the object of the Formula was only to guard the authority
   and integrity of the original text, and not to decide grammatical and
   critical questions. But in its natural effect such a mechanical theory
   of inspiration, which, to be of any practical use, requires a perpetual
   literary miracle in the preservation of the text, would supersede all
   textual criticism, and make the Targums, the Septuagint, the Vulgate,
   and other ancient versions, worse than useless.

   2. God decreed from eternity, first, to create man innocent; second, to
   permit (permittere) the fall; third, to elect some to salvation, and
   thus to reveal in them his mercy, but to leave the rest in the corrupt
   mass (alios vero in corrupta massa relinquere), and to devote them to
   eternal perdition. (This is clearly the Augustinian infralapsarianism.)
   In the gracious decree of election Christ himself is included, as the
   Mediator and our first-born Brother. The doctrine of an antecedent
   hypothetical will or intention of God [934] to save all men on
   condition of faith is rejected as unscriptural and as involving God in
   imperfection and contradiction. Art. 4-6. Against Amyraut.

   3. The covenant of works made by God with Adam before the fall,
   promising to him eternal life (symbolized by the tree of life in
   Paradise), on condition of perfect obedience. Art. 7-9. Against
   Amyraut.

   4. Immediate imputation of Adam's sin to all his posterity who fell in
   him, their representative head (in ipso ut capite et stirpe), and
   forfeited the promised blessing of the covenant of works. Man is thus
   doubly condemned, for his participation in the sin of Adam and for his
   hereditary depravity; to deny the former makes the latter doubtful.
   [935] Art. 10-12. Against La Place, not because he asserted mediate or
   consequent imputation (which the Formula likewise teaches), but because
   he excluded the other.

   5. Limited atonement. Christ died only for the elect, and not
   indiscriminately for all men. [936] The infinite value and inherent
   sufficiency of Christ's satisfaction is not denied, but the divine
   intention and the practical efficiency are limited, and adjusted to the
   particularism of the decree of election. Art. 13-16. Against Amyraut.

   6. The actual vocation to salvation never was absolutely general
   (numquam absolute universalis), but was confined to Israel in the old
   dispensation and to Christians in the new (Matt. xi. 25; Eph. i. 9).
   God's revelation in nature and providence (Rom. i. 19, 20) is
   insufficient for purposes of salvation, though it leaves the heathen
   without excuse for rejecting even this remnant of the knowledge of God.
   The external call of God through his "Word is always serious, and so
   far effective that it works salvation in the elect, and makes the
   unbelief of the reprobate inexcusable. [937] Art. 17-20. Against
   Amyraut, who extended the vocation beyond the limits of the visible
   Church and the ordinary means of grace.

   7. The natural as well as moral inability of man to believe the gospel
   of himself. [938] This twofold inability has its ground in the
   depravity of our nature, from which only the omnipotent power of the
   Holy Spirit can deliver us (1 Cor. ii. 14; 2 Cor. iv. 6). Art. 21, 22.
   Against Amyraut.

   8. A twofold covenant of God with man--the covenant of works made with
   Adam and through him with all men, but set aside by the fall, and the
   covenant of grace made only with the elect in Christ, which is forever
   valid, and exists under two economies, the Jewish and the Christian.
   The saints of the Old Testament were saved by the same faith in the
   Lamb of God as we are (Apoc. xiii. 8; Heb. xiii. 8; John xiv. 1); for
   out of Christ there is no salvation. The doctrine of the Holy Trinity
   is revealed in the Old Testament in words, figures, and types,
   sufficiently for salvation, though not as clearly as in the New. For no
   one can believe in Christ without the Holy Spirit, the third person in
   the Trinity. Amyraut's doctrine of three essentially different
   covenants--natural, legal, and evangelical, with different degrees of
   knowledge and piety--is disapproved. Art. 23-25.

   The concluding article (the 26th) prohibits the teaching of new or
   doubtful and unauthorized doctrines which are contrary to the Word of
   God, the Second Helvetic Confession, the Canons of the Synod of Dort,
   and other Reformed symbols.

   [926] The orthodox Lutherans, as far as they took notice of this
   controversy, saw in Amyraldism a concealment of Calvinism, a mockery on
   the part of God, a bridge to Syncretism, and characterized the gratia
   Amyraldina as a gratia Calvina, non divina. So Reheboldus, De natura et
   gratia Mosi Amyraldo opposita, Gissæ, 1651 (quoted by G. Frank, Vol. I.
   p. 43). Among American divines, Dr. Hodge notices this controversy
   (Syst. Theology, Vol. II. p. 322), and says that hypothetical
   redemption is liable to the objections against both Augustinianism and
   Arminianism. 'It does not remove the peculiar difficulties of
   Augustinianism, as it asserts the sovereignty of God in election.
   Besides, it leaves the case of the heathen out of view. They, having no
   knowledge of Christ, could not avail themselves of this decretum
   hypotheticum, and must therefore be considered as passed over by a
   decretum absolutum.' But Amyraut does notice the case of the heathen;
   see above.

   [927] Schweizer, pp. 307 sqq.; Ebrard, p. 555.

   [928] Schweizer gives a very full account of the writings on both
   sides, pp. 320-439. In modern times the great Schleiermacher has
   revived Amyraldism on German soil, but in a much bolder form, and at
   the expense of the Scripture doctrine of eternal punishment. He widens
   Calvinism (which he very acutely defends against Lutheranism and
   Arminianism) into a real and effective universalism of salvation, and
   makes the particularism of election and reprobation merely a temporary
   means to this end. Schweizer, one of his ablest pupils, adopts this
   solution of the problem in his Christliche Glaubenslehre, Leipzig,
   1872, Vol. II. Part II. pp. 78 sqq. and 444 sqq. But this solution is
   subject to all the objections of what in America is popularly called
   the system of Universalism: it turns conversion into a process of
   nature or necessity; it dulls the edge of warning; freedom implies the
   continued power of resistance; repentance becomes more and more
   difficult, and at last impossible, especially in hell and in the case
   of the devil and diabolized men.

   The only Scripture passage which the Federalists alleged in favor of

   [931] Turretin (Instit. Pars I. pp. 556, Loc. ix. de peccato, Qu. X.)
   charges De la Place with inventing this distinction to evade the force
   of the synodical decision of Charenton, 1645. Augustine and the
   Reformers did not use the terms, and hence are quoted on both sides.

   [932] 'Salvum enim utrinque per Dei gratiam stat fundamentum fidei. . .
   . Salva unitas corporis mystici et Sprititus. . . . Salvum denique apud
   nos semper tenerrimæ caritatis vinculum,' etc. The original draft of
   the Formula was even milder and much shorter. Schweizer has, in a
   purely historical interest, vindicated the memory of Heidegger and the
   comparatively moderate character of the Consensus Formula. See his
   extracts from the MS. of Heidegger's Report, in Niedner's Zeitschrift,
   above quoted, and his art. Heidegger, in Herzog's Real. Encykl.

   [933] 'In specie autem Hebraicus Veteris Testamenti Codex, quem ex
   traditione Ecclesiæ Judaicæ, cui olim Oracula Dei commissa sunt,
   accepimus hodieque retinemus, tum quoad consonas, tum quoad vocalia,
   sive puncta ipsa, sive punctorum saltem potestatem, et tum quoad res,

   Lydium lapidem, universæ, quæ extant, Versiones, sive orientales, sive
   occidentales exigendæ, et sicubi deflectunt, revocandæ sunt.' The same
   theory of plenary inspiration of words and thoughts, which dates from
   Rabbinical orthodoxy, but was not held by the Reformers, prevailed in
   the Lutheran Church since John Gerhard, and is even now extensively
   held, especially in England and America, by those whose faith in the
   Word of God is not affected by modern criticism. It was most ably
   defended by the venerable Dr. Louis Gaussen (1790-1863), Professor in
   the Free Church Theological School of Geneva, in his works on
   Theopneusty (1840; second edition, 1842), and on the Canon (1862, two
   vols.). Dissent from him led to the resignation of his colleague,
   Scherer. Gaussen admitted, however, the individualities of the sacred
   writers, and compares them to the keys of an immense organ, on which
   the Holy Spirit played.

   [935] Art. X. 'Censemus igitur peccatum Adami omnibus ejus posteris
   judicio Dei arcano et justo imputari' (Rom. v. 12, 19; 1 Cor. xv. 21,
   22). Art. XI. 'Duplici igitur nomine post peccatum homo natura, indeque
   ab ortu suo, antequam ullum actuale peccatum in se admittat, iræ ac
   maledictioni divinæ obnoxius est; primum quidem ob paraptoma et
   inobedientiam, quam in Adami lumbis commisit; deinde ab consequentem in
   ipso conceptu hereditariam corruptionem insitam, qua tota ejus natura
   depravata et spiritualiter mortua est, adeo quidem, ut recte peccatum
   originale statuatur duplex . . . imputatum videlicet, et hereditarium
   inhærens.'

   [936] Art. XIII. 'Pro solis electis ex decretorio Patris consilio
   propriaque intentione diram mortem oppetiit [Christus], solos illos in
   sinum paternæ gratiæ restituit, solos Deo Patri offenso reconciliavit
   et a maledictione legis liberavit.' Art. XVI. 'Haud probare possumus
   oppositam doctrinam illorum qui statuunt, Christum propria intentione
   et consilio tum suo tum Patris ipsum mittentis, mortuum esse pro
   omnibus et singulis, addita conditione impossibili, si videlicet
   credant.' The ablest modern advocate of this limited atonement theory
   is Dr. Hodge, Syst. Theol. Vol. II. pp. 544 sqq.

   [937] Art. XIX. 'Vocatio externa quæ per præconium Evangelicum fit,
   etiam vocantis Dei respectu, seria et sincera est. . . . Neque voluntas
   illa respectu eorum, qui vocationi non parent, inefficax est, quia
   semper Deus id, quod volens intendit, assequitur,' etc.

   [938] Art. XXI. 'Moralis ea impotentia dici possit, quatenus scilicet
   circa subjectum et objectum morale versatur: naturalis tamen esse simul
   et dici debet, quatenus homo phusei, natura, adeoque nascendi lege,
   inde ab ortu est filius iræ' (Eph. ii. 2). Dr. Hodge likewise defends
   this doctrine against the New School Calvinists, who, with Amyraut,
   claim for man the natural ability, but admit his moral inability.

   FRENCH PROTESTANTISM.

   In France the Reformation seemed to be better prepared than even in
   Germany, if we look only at the surface of the situation. The French
   Church had always maintained a certain independence of Rome, under the
   name of Gallican rights or liberties. Paris was, it is true, the chief
   seat of orthodox scholasticism, and the Sorbonne took an early
   opportunity to condemn Luther and his writings (1521); but it nursed
   also the spirit of mysticism and disciplinary reform, which led to the
   Councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basle. In the South a remnant, of the
   Waldenses had survived the bloody persecutions. The humanistic studies
   flourished greatly at Paris, Orleans, Bourges, and found favor at the
   court of Francis I. (1494-1547), who invited classical scholars from
   Italy, thought of calling Erasmus and even Melanchthon to his capital,
   and aided, for political, reasons, the Protestants in Germany, while
   yet he inflicted imprisonment and death upon them in France.

   For half a century, and amid bloody civil wars, three conflicting
   tendencies, represented by Calvin, Rabelais, and Loyola--who happened
   to be in Paris at about the same period--struggled for the mastery:
   Calvinism, with its high intelligence and uncompromising virtue; the
   Renaissance, with its elegant culture and frivolous skepticism; and
   Jesuitism, with its reactionary and unscrupulous fanaticism. Francis I.
   wavered between the Renaissance, which suited his natural taste, and
   Romanism, which was the religion of the masses of Frenchmen; his gifted
   sister, Queen Margaret, of Navarre (grandmother of Henry IV.),
   protected the Reformation and the Renaissance, and harbored at one time
   Calvin, and at another the Libertines. Romanism triumphed first over
   Protestantism, and afterwards over semi-evangelical Jansenism, and
   France reaped infidelity and the Revolution.

   Calvinism, always in the minority, and too stern and exacting for the
   national character, after a period of heroic martyrdom, gained for a
   time a limited legal existence under Henry IV. in the Edict of Nantes
   (1598), but was expelled under Louis XIV. to fertilize other countries,
   and reduced to a proscribed sect of the desert at home, where
   nevertheless, like the burning bush, it could not be consumed, and was
   providentially preserved for better days. [939]

   The father of French Protestantism in its unorganized form is Jacques
   Lefèvre d'Etaples (Faber Stapulensis, 1455-1537), Professor of the
   Sorbonne and tutor of the royal princes. He translated the Bible from
   the Vulgate (completed 1530); he taught, even before Luther and
   Zwingli, [940] the doctrine of justification by faith without human
   works or merit, and the supremacy of the Bible as a rule of faith, and
   predicted a reformation, saying to his pupil, Farel, 'God will renovate
   the world, and you will be a witness of it;' but he had to flee to
   Strasburg, and afterwards to the court of Queen Margaret.

   In the same spirit labored his friends and pupils--Briçonnet, Bishop of
   Meaux, who fostered evangelical doctrines and practices in his diocese,
   but afterwards timidly joined in the condemnation of Luther; Melchior
   Wolmar, a native of Germany, Professor of Greek in Bourges and teacher
   of Calvin; Louis de Berquin (1489-1599), a royal counselor, who was
   burned at the stake; Clement Marot (1495-1544), the favorite poet of
   his age and translator of the Psalms in verse; Peter Robert Olivetan
   (d. 1538), a relative of Calvin and translator of the Bible into French
   (printed at Neuchatel, 1535); William Farel (1489-1565), Peter Viret,
   Anton Froment, Calvin, and Beza--who were driven to French Switzerland.
   The radical extravagances of Anabaptists and anti-Trinitarians also
   spread in France, and were confounded by the government with the sound
   evangelical doctrines, and made a pretext for persecution.

   But it was only after Calvin, himself the greatest Protestant of
   France, had taken up his permanent abode in Geneva, that the
   Reformation movement was organized into a separate Church, and acquired
   a national importance. He therefore, and his friend and successor Beza,
   may be regarded as the fathers of the Reformed Church of France. Geneva
   became an asylum for their persecuted countrymen, and the nursery of
   evangelists. Henceforward French Protestantism assumed a Calvinistic
   type in doctrine and discipline, but, owing to the hostile attitude of
   the government, it was kept separate and distinct from the state.
   Although cruelly persecuted, and numbering its martyrs by thousands, it
   spread rapidly among the middle and higher classes, and in 1558 it
   embraced four hundred thousand followers.

   The first national Synod was held in Paris, May 25-28, 1559, under the
   moderatorship of François de Morel, then pastor of Paris, a friend and
   pupil of Calvin. [941] It gave the Reformed Church a compact
   organization by the adoption of the Gallican Confession of Faith, in
   connection with a Presbyterian form of government and discipline, which
   remained the firm basis of the Church as long as she was allowed to
   exist and to hold national Synods, twenty-nine in all, the last being
   that at Loudun, 1659.

   ANTOINE DE CHANDIEU.

   The Gallican Confession is the work of John Calvin, who prepared the
   first draft, and of his pupil, Antoine de la Roche Chandieu, who, with
   the Synod of Paris in 1559, brought it into its present enlarged shape.
   [942]

   Chandieu, or, as he is also called, Sadeel, [943] was born 1534, of a
   wealthy noble family, in the castle Chabot, in Burgundy, studied law in
   the University of Toulouse, was converted to Protestantism in Paris,
   renounced a splendid career, studied theology at Geneva, was ordained
   1554, and elected pastor of the small Reformed congregation in Paris.
   He was imprisoned 1557, escaped under the name Sadeel, was again
   imprisoned, but delivered by the hand of Anton de Bourbon (the father
   of Henry IV.), engaged in mission work near Poitiers, and returned to
   his congregation in Paris, 1559. He presided over the third National
   Reformed Synod at Orleans, 1562, attended as delegate the seventh
   National Synod at La Rochelle, 1571, barely escaped the massacre of St.
   Bartholomew (Aug. 24), fled with his family to Geneva, and taught
   theology at Lausanne. He received a commission in 1578 to attend a
   Protestant Union meeting at Frankfort, suggested by the Elector John
   Casimir, but never carried out. He was called back to France as
   chaplain of King Henry of Navarre (afterwards Henry IV.), returned to
   Geneva, 1589, and labored there as pastor and Professor of Hebrew till
   his death, Feb. 23, 1591. Beza esteemed him very highly. De Thou
   recommends him for 'noble birth, fine appearance, elegant manners,
   learning, eloquence, and rare modesty.' [944] Sadeel wrote twenty-three
   books and tracts, mostly in Latin, some in French, relating to
   Christian doctrines (especially the Word of God; the priesthood and
   sacrifice of Christ; the human nature of Christ; the spiritual
   manducation of his body), Church discipline, and the history of
   martyrs. [945]

   THE GALLICAN CONFESSIONS.

   On a visit to the mission church of Poitiers, after the holy communion,
   Chandieu was requested by the brethren to suggest to the church in
   Paris the importance of preparing a common confession of faith and
   order of discipline. [946] Calvin was consulted, and sent three
   delegates with a draft of a confession to Paris. This was enlarged and
   adopted by the Synod at Paris, 1559; presented, with a Preface, to King
   Francis II. at Amboise, 1560, and afterwards by Beza to Charles IX. at
   the religious conference in Poissy, 1561. It was revised and ratified
   at the seventh National Synod held at La Rochelle, 1571, with Beza as
   moderator, in the presence of the Queen of Navarre and her son (Henry
   IV.), and Admiral Coligny. Hence it is also called the 'Confession of
   Rochelle.' Three copies were written on parchment--one for La Rochelle,
   one for Geneva, one for Béarn--and signed by the ministers and elders
   present. [947]

   As to the text, the French is the original, but it exists in two
   recensions: the shorter contains thirty-five articles, the larger forty
   articles. The latter was sanctioned by the Synod of La Rochelle. [948]
   It was often printed in different languages, and attached to many
   French Bibles.

   CONTENTS.

   The Gallican Confession is a faithful summary of the doctrines of
   Calvin. It begins with God (art. 1), his revelation (2), and the
   Scriptures as the Word of God and certain rule of our faith, which is
   above all customs, edicts, decrees, and councils (3-5). The three
   oecumenical Symbols are adopted (5), because they agree with the Word
   of God. The Holy Scripture teaches the unity of essence and
   tripersonality of God--the Father, who is the first cause, principle,
   and origin of all things; the Son, his eternal Word and Wisdom,
   eternally begotten by the Father; the Holy Spirit, his virtue and power
   eternally proceeding from both (6). God in three co-working persons
   created all things, visible and invisible (7); and governs all things,
   even sin and evil, yet without being the author of sin, but so making
   use of devils and sinners as to turn to good the evil which they do,
   and of which they alone are guilty (8). Man was created pure and
   perfect, but fell by his own guilt, and became totally corrupt and a
   slave of sin, although he can still discern good and evil (9). All
   posterity of Adam is in bondage to original sin, which is an inherited
   evil (not an imitation merely), and sufficient for condemnation; even
   after baptism it is still sin, but the condemnation of it is abolished
   out of free grace (10, 11). God, according to his eternal and immutable
   purpose, calls out of this corrupt mass those whom he has chosen in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, without regard to their merit, to the praise of his
   glorious grace, leaving the rest in their corruption and condemnation,
   to the praise of his eternal justice (12). [949]

   Jesus Christ is our all-sufficient Saviour, and 'made unto us wisdom,
   and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption' (13). He assumed
   our human nature, being God and man in one person, like unto us in body
   and soul, yet without sin. We detest all ancient and modern heresies on
   the person of Christ, especially that of Servetus (14). The two natures
   in the one person of Christ are inseparably united, and yet remain
   distinct, so that the divine nature retains its attributes, being
   uncreated, infinite, and omnipresent, and the human nature continues
   finite and circumscribed (15). By the one sacrifice of Christ on the
   cross we are reconciled to God, and have the forgiveness of all our
   sins (16, 17). Our justification is founded on the remission of sins by
   the atoning death of Christ, without any merit of our own, and is
   apprehended and appropriated by faith alone (18-20). By this faith we
   are regenerated, and receive grace to lead a holy life, according to
   the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. Faith, then, of necessity produces good
   works, but these works are not accounted to us for righteousness, which
   must rest exclusively on the satisfaction of Christ; otherwise we would
   never have peace (21, 22). Christ is our only Advocate before the
   Father. We therefore reject the intercession of saints, and all other
   devices which detract from the all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ, as
   purgatory, monastic vows, pilgrimages, auricular confession,
   indulgences. We reject them not only on account of the false idea of
   merit attached to them, but also because they impose a yoke upon the
   conscience (23, 24).

   The Church, with the ministry and preaching of the Word of God, is a
   divine institution, and must be respected and obeyed. The true Church
   is the company of believers who agree to live according to the Word of
   God, and to advance in holiness. Nevertheless there may be hypocrites
   and reprobates in it, who can not destroy its character and title. We
   reject the papacy for its many superstitions, idolatries, and
   corruptions of the Word and Sacraments. But as some trace of the true
   Church is left in the papacy, together with the virtue and efficacy of
   baptism, and as the efficacy of baptism does not depend upon the
   personal character of the minister, we teach that those who received
   baptism in the Romish Church do not need a second baptism. The true
   Church should be governed by pastors, elders, and deacons. All true
   pastors have the same authority and power under one head, the only
   sovereign and universal bishop, Jesus Christ; and consequently no
   Church shall claim any authority or dominion over the other (25-33).
   [950] The Sacraments are added to the Word as pledges and seals of the
   grace of God to aid and comfort our faith. They are external signs
   through which God operates by the power of his Spirit. Their substance
   and truth is in Christ; separated from him they are empty shadows.
   There are but two Sacraments: Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism is
   the permanent pledge and signature of our adoption; by it we are
   grafted into the body of Christ, so as to be cleansed by his blood and
   renewed by the Holy Ghost. The Lord's Supper is the witness of our
   union with Christ, who truly nourishes us with his broken body and shed
   blood through the secret and incomprehensible power of his Spirit. We
   hold that this is done spiritually and by faith, not because we
   substitute imagination or thought for reality and truth, but because
   this great mystery surpasses our senses and the order of nature. In
   Baptism and the Lord's Supper God really gives us what they represent.
   Those who approach the Lord's table with true faith, as a vessel,
   receive the body and blood of Christ, which nourish the soul no less
   than bread and wine nourish the body (34--38).

   God has instituted kingdoms, republics, and other forms of government,
   whether hereditary or elective, for the order and peace of society. He
   has given the sword to the magistrate for the punishment of sin and
   crime, and the transgressions of the first as well as the second table
   of the Decalogue. [951] We must therefore obey the magistrate, pay
   tribute and taxes with a good and free will, even if the rulers are
   unbelievers. We therefore detest those who would resist authority,
   establish community of goods, and overthrow the order of justice (39,
   40).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [939] On an old seal, the device of which has been preserved, the
   French [Reformed] Church may be seen represented under the image of the
   burning bush of Moses, with this motto: "Flagror, sed non comburor."
   These words sum up the tragical history of our Church. This Church has
   been essentially militant; she has known better, perhaps, than any
   other what it is to fight for life. . . . Most young Frenchmen are
   brought up in a holy horror of Protestantism; and traces of this early
   impression are even found clinging to the minds of men of independent
   thought--nay, of those whose boast it is that they are
   free-thinkers.'--A. Decoppet, in his report on the Reformed Church in
   France, at the General Conference of the Evangelical Alliance in New
   York, 1873. See Proceedings, p. 72. The synodical seal, with the above
   motto and the date 1559, is reproduced on the title-page of the first
   volume of Bersier's Histoire du Synode Général de l'église réform, de
   France 1872 (Paris, 1872).

   says: 'Calvin first drew up the Confession itself.' But Beza, in his
   History, connects Chandieu prominently with the origin of the
   Confession, without expressly naming him as the author. It is based, in
   part at least, on a shorter Confession to the King (Au Roy), which
   Calvin probably prepared, 1557, for the congregation of Paris, in
   vindication against false charges. See Bonnet, Lettres de Calvin, Tom.
   II. p. 131, and Opera, Vol. IX. p. 715 (comp. Proleg. p. lix.). Calvin
   also wrote another French Confession of Faith, in the name of the
   French Churches, during the war, to be presented to the Emperor
   Maximilian and the German Diet at Frankfort, 1562. Reprinted in Opera,

   1559.' Quoted in Calv. Opera, Vol. IX. p. lix., from Aymon. The shorter
   edition is printed in Opera, Vol. IX. p. 739, under the title
   Confession de Foy faite d'un commun accord par les Églises qui sont
   dispersées en France et s'abstienent des idolatries papales. The larger
   edition is incorporated in the third volume of this work. It
   substitutes in the title for 'qui sont,' etc., the words 'qui désirent
   vivre selon la pureté de l'évangile de nostre Seigneur Jesus-Christ.'
   Comp. Heppe, pp. 509 sqq.

   [949] 'Laissant les autres en cette même corruption et condamnation,
   pour démontrer en eux ca justice, comme aux premiers il fait luire les
   richesses de sa miséricorde.'

   [950] The National Synod of Gap, 1603, inserted an article (31)
   declaring the pope to be 'the Antichrist and man of sin,' but the Synod
   of La Rochelle (1607) struck it out on account of the protest of the
   king. Heppe, p. 537.

   [951] 'Il a mis le glaive en la main des magistrats pour réprimer les
   pechés commis non seulement contre la seconde table des commandements
   de Dieu, mais aussi contre la première.' This clause justifies civil
   punishment of heresy. It is one of the chief causes why even orthodox
   members of the National Synod of 1872 were opposed to the re-adoption
   of this Confession in full.

   attended the Synod of 1872, as a delegate of the Free Church of France,
   and gave an account of it in the Journal de Genève. He has since joined
   the National Church.


   The thirtieth meeting of the General Synod of the Reformed Church in
   France forms an epoch in its history. It resumed the series of
   twenty-nine National Synods after an interruption of two hundred and
   twelve years. [952] The last was held at Loudun (Anjou), and was
   brought to a close in Jan., 1660, by an order of Louis XIV. prohibiting
   such synods in future, on the pretext that they were too expensive and
   troublesome, and that their business could be transacted in provincial
   synods. Daillé, the moderator, protested in vain. This act of injustice
   aimed to destroy the force of the Reformed communion by breaking it up
   into incoherent sections, and was crowned by the sweeping Revocation of
   the Edict of Nantes (Oct. 22, 1685), which deprived France of a million
   of her best citizens, and reduced the remnant of Protestants to a
   forbidden sect The history of this dark period is full of touching and
   dramatic interest. 'The Reformed Church of the Desert,' under 'the most
   Christian' King of France, like the primitive Church under the sway of
   heathen Rome, had to hold its synodical meetings in the open fields, in
   mountain-passes, and caverns of the earth. [953] In those meetings the
   Gallican Confession was read, and prayer offered for the persecuting
   king. The spread of infidelity, which followed as a reaction against
   the tyranny of superstition and bigotry, brought first an edict of
   universal toleration under Louis XVI. (1787), and soon afterwards a
   total overthrow of Christianity and social order, until Napoleon, in
   1802, restored the Roman Church as the religion of the majority of
   Frenchmen, and the Reformed Church as the religion of a small though
   respectable minority, but both under the pay and control of the State,
   and without the right of synodical self-government and discipline.
   [954]

   This right, denied by the Bourbon, the Napoleon, and the Orleanist
   dynasties, was at last restored to the Reformed Church by the
   Republican government under Thiers, who, by an edict of Nov. 29, 1871,
   authorized the Consistories in France and Algiers to elect delegates to
   a General Synod. Under these auspices the General Synod convened in the
   Temple du Saint-Esprit, at Paris, from June 6th to July 10th, 1872. It
   consisted of one hundred and eight delegates (forty-nine ministers and
   fifty-nine laymen), the legitimate descendants of those few humble but
   enthusiastic and heroic pastors and elders who met in the same city, in
   1559, with torture and death staring them in the face. It was opened by
   a sermon of pastor Charles Babut of Nîmes on John viii. 14. Charles
   Edouard Bastie, pastor of Bergerac (Dordogne), was elected moderator.
   The object of the Synod was to again effect a complete organization on
   the basis of a confession of faith and a system of discipline.

   But the preparation and adoption of a confession of faith is a more
   difficult task in the nineteenth century than it was in the sixteenth.
   For, like all other Protestant denominations, the French Church had
   during the eighteenth century undergone a theological revolution, and
   is still in a process of transition. The doctrinal system of the
   Gallican Confession had lost its hold upon a large portion of the
   clergy and laity; and even the most orthodox Protestants could not
   subscribe that article which, in harmony with the general sentiment of
   the sixteenth century, conceded to the civil government (hostile as it
   then was to the Huguenots) the power to punish heresy by the sword.
   [955] On the other hand, that venerable document, which embodied the
   faith of the fathers and martyrs of the French Church, could not be
   ignored without ingratitude and want of self-respect. Under these
   circumstances the General Synod, at its thirteenth session, June 20,
   1872, adopted a middle course in the following declaration of faith,
   proposed by Charles Bois, Professor of Church History at Montauban:

   'The Reformed Church of France, on resuming her synodical action, which
   for so many years had been interrupted, desires, before all things, to
   offer her thanks to God, and to testify her love to Jesus Christ, her
   Divine Head, who has sustained and comforted her during her successive
   trials. 'Au moment où elle reprend la suite de ses Synodes, interrompus
   depuis tant d'années, l'Église réformée de France éprouve, avant toutes
   choses, le besoin de rendre grâces à Dieu, et de témoigner son amour à
   Jésus-Christ, son divin Chef, qui l'a soutenue et consolée durant le
   cours de ses épreuves.
   'She declares, through the organ of her representatives, that she
   remains faithful to her principles of faith and freedom on which she
   was founded. 'Elle déclare par l'organe de ses représentants qu'elle
   reste fidèle aux principes de foi et de liberté sur lesquels elle a été
   fondée.
   'With her fathers and her martyrs in the Confession of Rochelle, [956]
   and with all the Churches of the Reformation in their respective
   creeds, she proclaims the sovereign authority of the Holy Scriptures in
   matters of faith, and salvation by faith in Jesus Christ, the
   only-begotten Son of God, who died for our sins, and was raised again
   for our justification. 'Avec ses pères et ses martyrs dans la
   Confession de la Rochelle, avec toutes les Églises de la Réformation
   dans leurs symboles, elle proclame l'autorité souveraine des Saintes
   Écritures en matière de foi, et le salut par la foi en Jésus-Christ,
   Fils unique de Dieu, mort pour nos offenses et ressuscité pour notre
   justification.
   'She preserves and maintains, as the basis of her teaching, of her
   worship and her discipline, the grand Christian facts represented in
   her religious solemnities, and set forth in her liturgies, especially
   in the Confession of sins, the Apostles' Creed, and in the order for
   the administration of the Lord's Supper.' 'Elle conserve donc et elle
   maintient, à la base de son enseignement, de son culte et de sa
   discipline, les grands faits chrétiens représentés dans ses solennités
   religieuses et exprimés dans ses liturgies, notamment dans la
   Confession des péchés, dans le Symbole des Apôtres, et dans la liturgie
   de la saint Cène.'

   This moderate Confession was adopted by 61 votes against 45, or a
   majority of only 16 members. [957] Among the affirmative votes are
   those of Babut, Bois, Breyton, Dhombres, Juillerat, and the venerable
   octogenarian Guizot, whose last public act was a testimony of faith on
   the floor of this General Synod of the Church of his fathers, declaring
   before his retirement that the Church must affirm its faith in the
   supernatural incarnation, the miracles, the resurrection of Christ, or
   cease to be a Church. The rationalistic minority, including Colani,
   Coquerel (Athanase and Etienne), Pécaut, Rivet, protested against the
   adoption of any creed, and asserted the right of each pastor, elder,
   and private member of the Church to adhere to whatever creed he may
   think proper. Nevertheless, they expressed their determination to hold
   on to the National Reformed Church.

   The French Government ratified the decision of the Synod (1873).
   Subscription to its Confession may be hereafter a qualification of
   electors. The liberal party abstained from participation in the second
   session of the General Synod held in Nov. and Dec., 1873, and sent in a
   request to agree to a peaceful separation; but this request was
   refused. [958]

   Hence the Rationalists, if they have sufficient interest in positive
   Christianity, will be obliged to secede and organize a new society
   similar to the Unitarian body in England and the United States.

   A separation is preferable to an unnatural alliance at the expense of
   truth and charity. And it would be all the more honorable if it be done
   with an equitable division of Church property.

   The acts of the General Synod of the National Church had the double
   effect of virtually excluding the rationalistic party, and of
   attracting to a closer fellowship the Free Church, which, like the Free
   Churches in French Switzerland, represents modern evangelical
   Calvinism, independent of state support and state control. [959]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [952] See a list of the French National Synods in Bersier, Vol. II. pp.
   429 sqq.

   [953] Eight of these forbidden Synods were held between 1726 and 1763.

   [954] Napoleon's motive was chiefly of a political character. He needed
   religion as a basis of society, and Protestantism as a check upon the
   ambition of popery; yet he professed to a number of Protestant pastors
   to be a friend of the liberty of conscience, whose 'indefinite empire
   begins where the empire of law ends,' and he authorized them to brand
   with the name of Nero any one of his successors who should violate this
   liberty. Napoleon III. professed the same policy, but threw the weight
   of his power into the scale of Romanism, and made a distinction between
   the private liberty of conscience, which nobody can touch, and the
   public liberty of worship, which requires a recognition by the State.

   [955] Art. 39: 'God has put the sword into the hands of magistrates to
   suppress crimes against the first as well as against the second table
   of his Commandments.' It was on that ground that Servet's execution in
   Geneva for blasphemy was justified.

   [956] That is, the Gallican Confession as revised and adopted by the
   National Synod of La Rochelle, 1571. See § 62.

   [957] Two members were absent. The official report says: 'Le nombre des
   votants est de 106. Majorité absolue 54. Le dépouillement du scrutin
   donne 61 bulletins blancs, 45 bulletins bleus.'

   [958] The following action was taken by the Synod in reference to the
   petition of the minority: 'The Assembly, considering that the General
   Synod is the high court of the Church, and so acknowledged by the
   State; considering that the decisions arrived at in reference to the
   Confession of Faith reproduce the doctrines on which the Reformed
   Church of France was founded, and that, therefore, all who reject them
   are ipso facto without the pale of the Church; considering that none
   can be constrained to remain in a Church the creed of which he rejects,
   and from which he wishes to retire--every man having entire liberty to
   remain or separate himself, according to the dictation of his
   conscience; considering that the Synod has taken no resolutions to
   restrict the liberty of any, especially none to prevent the retirement
   of any pastors and members in order to found another Church, and none
   to prevent such persons from obtaining the recognition of the State,
   the advantages of the concordat, and an equitable share of
   ecclesiastical temporalities; considering, lastly, that it is not the
   business of the General Synod itself to inaugurate the formation of a
   new Church, its mission being to construct, and not to rend asunder,
   passes to the order of the day.'

   [959] The Free Church, or 'Union of the Evangelical Churches in France'
   (l'Union des églises évangéliques de France), to which Pressensé, Fish,
   and Bersier belong, owes its existence to the rationalism in the
   National Church which, at the synodical meeting held after the February
   Revolution of 1848 (without government sanction, and hence without
   legislative effect), refused to acknowledge the divinity of Christ.
   This induced Frederick Monod to secede, while his more distinguished
   and equally conscientious brother Adolph remained, to the benefit of
   the National body, which since that time has become more orthodox. The
   Union manifests a good deal of missionary zeal and literary activity,
   and reacts favorable on the Established Church. Bersier, in his History
   of the General Synod, expresses himself satisfied with its results
   (close of Introduction to Vol. I. p. lvii.): 'Nos sympathies
   personnelles sont avec la droite dans les trois grandes questions que
   le Synode a eu à résoudre: celle de l'autorité du Synode, celle de la
   déclaration de foi, celle enfin des conditions de foi et de doctrine
   auxquelles les pasteurs et les électeurs devront désormais souscrire.
   Nous estimons que par ces trois votes la majorité a accompli des actes
   nécessaires, et que si, par un abus de pouvoir que nous ne voulons pas
   prévoir, le gouvernement refusait de ratifier son oeuvre [the
   ratification has since been granted], elle aurait néanmoins posé les
   fondations futures sur lesquelles, avec ou sans appui de l'État,
   l'Église réformée devra désormais s'élever.'

   THE REFORMATION IN THE NETHERLANDS.

   The Low Countries, conquered from the sea by indomitable energy--the
   land of Erasmus, of free cities, of inventions, and flourishing
   commerce --was flooded, through merchants, soldiers, and books, with
   Protestant ideas from Germany and France, as with waters from the Rhine
   and the Meuse. Already in 1521 Charles V., who afterwards regretted
   that he had not burned Luther at Worms, issued from that city an edict
   for the suppression of heresy in this the most valuable of his
   inherited dominions. To Belgium belongs the honor of having furnished
   the first martyrs of evangelical Protestanism in Henry Voes and John
   Esch, two Augustinian monks, who were burned at the stake in Brussels,
   July 1, 1523, reciting the Apostles' Creed and singing the Te Deum, and
   who were celebrated by Luther in a stirring hymn. [960] This was the
   fiery signal of a fearful persecution, which reached its height under
   Philip II. of Spain, and the executor of his bloody designs, the Duke
   of Alva, but resulted at last in the establishment of national
   independdence and of the Reformed Church in a large part of the
   Netherlands. The number of her martyrs exceeds that of any other
   Protestant Church during the sixteenth century, and perhaps that of the
   whole primitive Church under the Roman empire. [961] During the
   ever-memorable conflict under William of Orange, who was assassinated
   by a fanatical papist in 1584, and his second son Maurice--an able
   military commander and strict Calvinist (d. 1625)--the Bible, with the
   Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism, was the spiritual guide and
   comforter of the Protestants, and fortified them against the assaults
   of the enemy. Calvinism, which fears God and no body else, inspired
   that heroic courage which triumphed over the political and religious
   despotism of Spain, and raised Holland to an extraordinary degree of
   commercial and literary eminence. [962]

   GUIDO DE BRÈS.

   The chief author of the Belgic Confession is Guido (or Guy, Wido) de
   Brès, a noble evangelist and martyr of the Reformed Church of the
   Netherlands. He was born about 1523 at Mons, in Hennegau, educated in
   the Roman Church, and by diligent reading of the Scriptures converted
   to the evangelical faith. Expelled from his country, he sought refuge
   in London under Edward VI., where he joined the Belgic fugitives, and
   prepared himself for the ministry. Afterwards he studied at Lausanne,
   and became a traveling evangelist in Southwestern Belgium and Northern
   France--from Dieppe to Sedan, from Valenciennes to Antwerp. After the
   conquest of French Flanders he was, together with a younger missionary
   from Geneva, Peregrin de la Grange, taken prisoner, put in chains, and
   hanged on the last day of May, 1567, for disobedience to the commands
   of the court at Brussels, and especially for the distribution of the
   holy communion in the Reformed congregations. From prison the youthful
   martyr wrote letters of comfort to his brethren, his old mother, his
   wife, and his children, and met his death as if it were a
   marriage-feast. [963] In his proper home Protestantism was completely
   suppressed, but in the neighboring countries of Holland and the Lower
   Rhine it spread and flourished.

   THE BELGIC CONFESSION.

   The Belgic Confession was prepared in 1561 by Guido de Brès, with the
   aid of Adrien de Saravia (professor of theology in Leyden, afterwards
   at Cambridge, where he died, 1613), H. Modetus (for some time chaplain
   of William of Orange), and G. Wingen, in the French language, to prove
   the Reformed faith from the Word of God. [964] It was revised by
   Francis Junius, of Bourges (1545-1602)--a student of Calvin, pastor of
   a Walloon congregation at Antwerp, and afterwards professor of theology
   at Leyden--who abridged the sixteenth article, and sent a copy to
   Geneva and other churches for approval. It was probably printed in
   1562, or at all events in 1566, and afterwards translated into Dutch,
   German, and Latin. It was presented to the bigoted Philip II., 1562, in
   the vain hope of securing toleration, and with an address which
   breathes the genuine spirit of martyrdom. The petitioners protest
   against the charge of being rebels, and declare that notwithstanding
   they number more than a hundred thousand, and are exposed to the most
   cruel oppression, they obey the Government in all lawful things; but
   that rather than deny Christ before men they would 'offer their backs
   to stripes, their tongues to knives, their mouths to gags, and their
   whole bodies to the fire, well knowing that those who follow Christ
   must take his cross and deny themselves.' [965]

   The Confession was publicly adopted by a Synod at Antwerp (1566), then
   at Wesel (1568), more formally by a Synod at Emden (1571) [966] by a
   national Synod at Dort (1574), another at Middelburg (1581), and again
   by the great Synod of Dort, April 29, 1619. But inasmuch as the
   Arminians had demanded partial changes, and the text had become
   confused, the Synod of Dort submitted the French, Latin, and Dutch
   texts to a careful revision. Since that time the Belgic Confession,
   together with the Heidelberg Catechism, has been the recognized symbol
   of the Reformed Churches in Holland and Belgium. [967] It is also the
   doctrinal standard of the Reformed (Dutch) Church in America, which
   holds to it even more tenaciously than the mother Church in the
   Netherlands. [968]

   CONTENTS.

   The Belgic Confession contains thirty-seven Articles, and follows the
   order of the Gallican Confession, but is less polemical and more full
   and elaborate, especially on the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Church,
   and the Sacraments. [969] It is, upon the whole, the best symbolical
   statement of the Calvinistic system of doctrine, with the exception of
   the Westminster Confession.

   THE TEXT.

   The text has undergone several modifications as regards the wording and
   length, but not as regards the doctrine.

   The French text must be considered as the original. [970] Of the first
   edition of 1561 or 1562 no copies are known. The Synod of Antwerp, in
   Sept., 1580, ordered a precise parchment copy of the revised text (of
   Junius) to be made for its archives, which copy had to be signed by
   every new minister. This manuscript has always been regarded in the
   Belgic churches as the authentic document. [971] The Synod of Dort
   ordered a new revision, with a view to bring the Latin, French, and
   Dutch texts into harmony on the basis of the manuscript copy of 1580.
   The Leyden edition of 1669 gives in two parallel columns the original
   text and the revised text of Dort. A Rotterdam edition of the Psalter,
   1787, carefully reprints the original text in the old spelling from the
   manuscript, with the changes of Dort in notes. The Brussels edition of
   1850 presents the ancient text of 1580, as revised at Dort, in modern
   French. [972]

   Next in authority is the Latin text, but of this there are likewise
   several recensions, a shorter and a larger. The first Latin translation
   was made from the revised French copy of Francis Janius, probably by
   Beza, or under his direction, for the Harmonia Confessionum, Geneva,
   1581 (distributed under different heads, with the other Confessions).
   [973] The same passed into the first edition of the Corpus et Syntagma
   Confessionum, Geneva, 1612. Another translation was prepared, 1618, for
   the use of the Synod of Dort, by Festus Hommius, pastor in Leyden, and
   one of the scribes of that Synod. [974] This text was revised in the
   following year by that Synod, and thus approved and incorporated with
   its acts in the 146th session. [975] The revision of Dort was
   reproduced in the second edition of the Corpus et Syntagma Conf., 1654.
   [976] The excellent English version in use in the Reformed Dutch Church
   of America is made from the Latin text of the Synod of Dort.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [960] See a part of it, in English and German, quoted by Gieseler, Vol.
   IV. p. 311 (Am. ed.).

   [961] Grotius estimates the number of Protestant martyrs in Holland,
   under one reign, at one hundred thousand. Gibbon (History of the
   Decline, etc., at the close of Ch. XVI.) confidently asserts that 'the
   number of Protestants who were executed by the Spaniards in a single
   province and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs
   in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman empire.' And Motley
   (History of the Rise of the Dutch Republic, Vol. II. p. 504) says of
   the terrible reign of Alva: 'The barbarities committed amid the sack
   and ruin of those blazing and starving cities are almost beyond belief;
   unborn infants were torn from the living bodies of their mothers; women
   and children were violated by the thousands, and whole populations
   burned and hacked to pieces by soldiers in every mode which cruelty in
   its wanton ingenuity could devise.'

   [962] It is strange that Motley, in his great works on the Rise, and
   the History of the Dutch Republic, ignores the Belgic Confession, and
   barely mentions the name of Guido de Brès.

   [963] See, on Guy de Brès, the enlarged edition of Crespin's Histoire
   des Martyrs, Genève, 1617, pp. 731-750, and the Brussels edition of the
   Conf. de foi, p. 19.

   [964] Saravia, in a letter to Uytenbogardus (Apr. 13, 1612), quoted by
   Niemeyer (Proleg. p. lii.) and Gieseler (Ch. Hist. Vol. IV. p. 314, Am.
   ed.), says: 'Ego me illius confessionis ex primis unum fuisse
   auctoribus profiteor, sicut et Hermannus Modetus: nescio an plures sint
   superstites. Illa primo fuit conscripta Gallico sermone a Christi servo
   et martyre Guidone de Brès, sed antequam ederetur ministris verbi Dei,
   quos potuit nancisci, illam communicavit: et emendandum si quid
   displiceret, addendum, detrahendum proposuit, ut unius opus censeri non
   debeat. Sed nemo eorum, qui manum apposuerunt, umquam cogitavit fidei
   canonem edere, verum ex canonicis scriptis fidem suam probare.'

   [965] The address is given in full by Böckel, 1.c. pp. 480-484.

   [966] The Brussels ed. (p. viii.) says: 'Le 8 Octobre, en 1571, il fût
   statué par le premier synode national des Églises wallonnes et
   flamandes ténu à Embden, que cette Confession serait signée par tous
   les membres présents au dit synode et par tous ceux qui seraient admis
   au saint ministère.'

   [967] The Société évangélique or Église Chrétienne missionnaire belge
   requires from its ministers a qualified subscription to the Belgic
   Confession with 'une réserve préalable en repoussant ce qui dans la
   Confession belge regarde l'exercise du pouvoir civil en matière de
   foi.'

   [968] The following formula of subscription is required from ministers
   of the Dutch Reformed Church in America: 'We, the underwritten,
   Ministers of the Word of God, residing within the bounds of the Classis
   of N. N., do hereby sincerely, and in good conscience before the Lord,
   declare by this our subscription, that we heartily believe, and are
   persuaded, that all the articles and points of doctrine contained in
   the [Belgic] Confession and [Heidelberg] Catechism of the Reformed
   [Dutch] Church, together with the explanation of some points of the
   aforesaid doctrine made in the National Synod held at Dordrecht, in the
   year 1619, do fully agree with the Word of God. We promise, therefore,
   diligently to teach, and faithfully to defend the aforesaid doctrine,
   without either directly or indirectly contradicting the same by our
   public preaching or writings. We declare, moreover, that we not only
   reject all errors that militate against this doctrine, and particularly
   those which are condemned in the above-mentioned Synod, but that we are
   disposed to refute and contradict them, and to exert ourselves in
   keeping the Church pure from such errors. And if hereafter any
   difficulties or different sentiments respecting the aforesaid doctrine
   should arise in our minds, we promise that we will neither publicly nor
   privately propose, teach, or defend the same, either by preaching or by
   writing, until we have first revealed such sentiment to the Consistory,
   Classis, or Synod, that the same may be there examined,' etc.

   [969] Ebrard (Handbuch der Kirchen- und Dogmengesch. Vol. III. p. 319)
   says that besides the Gallican Confession as the basis, use was made
   also of the Friesian Confession of Utenhoven, which the English exiles
   brought with them to Emden, and of the Catechism of Laski.

   [970] It is entitled, 'Confession de Foy faicte d'un commun accord pour
   les fidèles qui conversent ès Pays-Bas, lesquels désirent vivre selon
   la pureté de l'Évangile de nostre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.' This title is
   followed by two mottoes--the one from Apoc. ii. 10: 'Sois fidèle
   jusques à la mort et je te donneray la couronne de vie;' the other from
   1 Pet. iii. 15: 'Soyez tousjours appareillez à respondre à chacun qui
   vous demande raison de l'espérance qui est en vous.' On the second leaf
   there is over the head of the first article the brief title,
   'Confession vrayement Chrétienne contenant le sommaire de la doctrine
   de Dieu et salut éternel de l'âme.'

   [971] The Brussels ed. says (p. 39): 'C'est probablement d'après la
   copie de Junius que cette Confession a été imprimée dans le livre des
   Martyrs de Crespin. Le text de Crespin ne diffère pas de celui du
   manuscrit authentique.'

   [972] This careful edition, issued by the Evangelical Society of
   Belgium, is reproduced in the third volume of this work, together with
   the English version now used by the Dutch Reformed Church in America.
   Both agree, sentence for sentence.

   [973] See Note critique at the close of the Brussels edition, p. 39:
   'Junius envoya une copie de cette révision à Genève. Theodore de Beza
   la fit imprimer [in French?]. C'est lui, sans doute, qui la traduisit
   en latin, comme elle se trouve dans "l'Harmonia Confessionum," Genevæ,
   1581.' That this was the first Latin translation is stated in the
   Harmonia, p. 3: 'Belgica, Gallice omnium Belgicarum Ecclesiarum nomine
   anno 1566 edita, ac demum anno 1579 [1571?] in publica Belgii Synodo
   repetita et confirmata, Belgiceque versa. Nunc denique a nobis etiam
   Latine expressa.'

   [974] 'Confessio ecclesiarum reformatarum in Belgio. . . . in usum
   futuræ synodi nationalis latine edidit et collegit Festus Hommius.'
   Ludg. Batav. 1618. Niemeyer (pp. 360 sqq.) gives this translation,
   which more nearly agrees with the older version, and he adds some
   readings from the first edition of the Corpus et Syntagma.

   [975] See the extracts from the Acts of the 144th Session, April 29,
   1619, in Niemeyer, p. lv.

   [976] Under the title Ecclesiarum Belgicarum Christiana atque Orthodoxa
   Confessio, summam doctrinæ de Deo et æterna animarum salute
   complectens, prout in Synodo Dortrechtana fuit recognita et approbata.
   The articles are numbered, but have no titles. The difference between
   this and the first Latin translation may be judged from the following
   specimen:
   Harmonia Confessionum, 1581 (p. 36). Corpus et Syntagma Confessionum,
   ed. II., 1654 (p. 129).

   The Arminian controversy is the most important which took place within
   the Reformed Church. It corresponds to the Pelagian and the Jansenist
   controversies in the Catholic Church. It involves the problem of ages,
   which again and again has baffled the ken of theologians and
   philosophers, and will do so to the end of time: the relation of divine
   sovereignty and human responsibility. It started with the doctrine of
   predestination, and turned round five articles or 'knotty points' of
   Calvinism; hence the term 'quinquarticular' controversy. Calvinism
   represented the consistent, logical, conservative orthodoxy;
   Arminianism an elastic, progressive, changing liberalism. Calvinism
   triumphed in the Synod of Dort, and excluded Arminianism. So, in the
   preceding generation, strict Lutheranism had triumphed over
   Melanchthonianism in the Formula of Concord. But in both Churches the
   spirit of the conquered party rose again from time to time within the
   ranks of orthodoxy, to exert its moderating and liberalizing influence
   or to open new issues in the progressive march of theological science.

   ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF ARMINIANISM TILL 1618.

   The Arminian controversy arose in Holland towards the close of the
   heroic conflict with foreign political and ecclesiastical despotism.
   This very contest of forty-five years' duration, so full of trials and
   afflictions, stimulated the intellectual and moral energies of an
   honest, earnest, freedom-loving, and tenacious people, and made the
   Protestant part of the Netherlands the first country in Christendom for
   industry, commerce, education, and culture. The Universities of Leyden,
   founded in 1575, as the city's reward for its heroic resistance to
   Spain, Franecker (1585), Groningen (1612), Utrecht (1636), and
   Harderwyk (1648) soon excelled older schools of learning. The general
   prosperity of the United Provinces excited the admiration of the
   foreign delegates to the Synod of Dort, where they found clean and
   stately mansions, generous hospitality, and every comfort and luxury
   which commerce could bring from all parts of the earth. This was the
   soil on which the Calvinistic system was brought to its severest test.
   The controversy was purely theological in its nature, but owing to the
   intimate connection of Church and State it became inevitably entangled
   in political issues, and shook the whole country. The Reformed Churches
   in France, Switzerland, Germany, England, and Scotland took a deep
   interest in it, and sided, upon the whole, with the Calvinistic party;
   while the Lutheran Church sympathized to some extent with the Arminian.

   The founder of Arminianism, from whom it derives its name, is James
   Arminius (1560-1609). [977] He studied under Beza at Geneva, was
   elected minister at Amsterdam (1588), and then professor of theology at
   Leyden (1603), as successor of Francis Junius, who had taken part in
   the revision of the Belgic Confession. He was at first a strict
   Calvinist, but while engaged in investigating and defending the
   Calvinistic doctrines against the writings of Dirik Volckaerts zoon
   Koornheert, [978] at the request of the magistrate of Amsterdam, he
   found the arguments of the opponent stronger than his own convictions,
   and became a convert to the doctrine of universal grace and of the
   freedom of will. He saw in the seventh chapter of Romans the
   description of a legalistic conflict of the awakened but unregenerate
   man, while Augustine and the Reformers referred it to the regenerate.
   He denied the decree of reprobation, and moderated the doctrine of
   original sin. He advocated a revision of the Belgic Confession and
   Heidelberg Catechism. He came into open conflict with his
   supralapsarian colleague, Francis Gomar (1563-1645), who had conferred
   on him the degree of doctor of divinity, but now became his chief
   antagonist. Hence the strict Calvinists were called 'Gomarists.' The
   controversy soon spread over all Holland. Arminius applied to the
   Government to convoke a synod (appealing, like the Donatists, to the
   very power which afterwards condemned him), but died of a painful
   disorder before it convened. [979] He was a learned and able divine;
   and during the controversy which embittered his life he showed a meek,
   Christian spirit. 'Condemned by others,' said Grotius, 'he condemned
   none.' His views on anthropology and soteriology approached those of
   the Melanchthonian school in the Lutheran Church, but the tendency of
   his theology was towards a latitudinarian liberalism, which developed
   itself in his followers. [980]

   After his death the learned Simon Episcopius (Bisschop, 1583-1644), his
   successor in the chair of theology at Leyden, afterwards professor in
   the Arminian College at Amsterdam, [981] and the eloquent Janus
   Uytenbogaert (1557-1644), preacher at the Hague, and for some time
   chaplain of Prince Maurice, became the theological leaders of the
   Arminian party. The great statesman, John van Olden Barneveldt
   (1549-1619), Advocate-General of Holland and Friesland, and Hugo
   Grotius (1583-1645), the most comprehensive scholar of his age, equally
   distinguished as statesman, jurist, theologian, and exegete,
   sympathized with the Arminians, gave them the weight of their powerful
   influence, and advocated peace and toleration; but they favored a
   republican confederacy of States rather than a federal State tending to
   monarchy, against the ambitious designs of Maurice, the Stadtholder and
   military leader of the Republic, who wished to consolidate his power,
   and by concluding a truce with Spain (1609) they incurred the suspicion
   of disloyalty. [982] The Calvinists were the national and popular
   party, and embraced the great majority of the clergy. They stood on the
   solid basis of the recognized standards of doctrine. At the same time
   they advocated the independent action of the Church against the
   latitudinarian Erastianism of their opponents.

   The Arminians formularized their creed in Five Articles (drawn up by
   Uytenbogaert), and laid them before the representatives of Holland and
   West Friesland in 1610 under the name of Remonstrance, signed by
   forty-six ministers. The Calvinists issued a Counter-Remonstrance.
   Hence the party names Remonstrants (Protestants against Calvinism), and
   Counter-Remonstrants (Calvinists, or Gomarists). A Conference was held
   between the two parties at the Hague (Collatio Hagiensis) in 1611, but
   without leading to an agreement. A discussion at Delft, 1613, and the
   edict of the States of Holland in favor of peace, 1614, prepared by
   Grotius, had no better result.

   THE SYNOD OF DORT.

   At last, after a great deal of controversy and complicated
   preparations, the National Synod of Dort [983] was convened by the
   States-General, Nov. 13, 1618, and lasted till May 9, 1619. It
   consisted of eighty-four members and eighteen secular commissioners. Of
   these fifty-eight were Dutchmen, the rest foreigners. The foreign
   Reformed Churches were invited to send at least three or four divines
   each, with the right to vote.

   James I. of England sent Drs. George Carleton, Bishop of Llandaff
   (afterwards of Chichester); John Davenant, Bishop of Salisbury; Samuel
   Ward, Professor of Cambridge; the celebrated Joseph Hall, afterwards
   Bishop of Exeter and Norwich (who, however, had to leave before the
   close, and was replaced by Thomas Goad), and Walter Balcanquall, a
   Scotchman, and chaplain of the King. The Palatinate was represented by
   Drs. Abraham Scultetus, Henry Alting, Professors at Heidelberg, and
   Paulus Tossanus; Hesse, by Drs. George Cruciger, Paul Stein, Daniel
   Angelocrator, and Rudolph Goclenius; Switzerland, by Dr. John Jacob
   Breitinger, Antistes of Zurich, Sebastian Beck and Wolfgang Meyer of
   Basle, Marcus Rutimeyer of Berne, John Conrad Koch of Schaffhausen,
   John Deodatus and Theodor Tronchin of Geneva; Bremen, by Matthias
   Martinius, Henry Isselburg, and Ludwig Crocius. The Elector of
   Brandenburg chose delegates, but excused their absence on account of
   age. The national Synod of France elected four delegates--among them
   the celebrated theologians Chamier and Du Moulin--but the King forbade
   them to leave the country. King James instructed the English delegates
   to 'mitigate the heat on both sides,' and to advise the Dutch ministers
   [984] 'not to deliver in the pulpit to the people those things for
   ordinary doctrines which are the highest points of schools and not fit
   for vulgar capacity, but disputable on both sides.'

   The Synod was opened and closed with great solemnity, and held one
   hundred and fifty-four formal sessions, besides a larger number of
   conferences. [985] The expenses were borne by the States-General on a
   very liberal scale, and exceeded 100,000 guilders. [986] The sessions
   were public, and crowded by spectators. John Bogerman, pastor at
   Leuwarden, was elected President; Festus Hommius, pastor in Leyden,
   first Secretary--both strict Calvinists. The former had translated
   Beza's tract on the punishment of heretics into Dutch; the latter
   prepared a new Latin version of the Belgic Confession. The whole Dutch
   delegation was orthodox. Only three delegates from the provincial Synod
   of Utrecht were Remonstrants, but these had to yield their seats to the
   three orthodox members elected by the minority in that province.
   Gomarus represented supralapsarian Calvinism, but the great majority
   were infralapsarians or sublapsarians.

   Thus the fate of the Arminians was decided beforehand. Episcopius and
   his friends--thirteen in all--were summoned before the Synod simply as
   defendants, and protested against unconditional submission.

   Orthodox Calvinism achieved a complete triumph. The Five Articles of
   the Remonstrance were unanimously rejected, and five Calvinistic canons
   adopted, together with the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg
   Catechism. A thorough and most excellent revision of the Dutch Bible
   from the Hebrew and Greek was also ordered, besides other decisions
   which lie beyond our purpose.

   The victory of orthodoxy was obscured by the succeeding deposition of
   about two hundred Arminian clergymen, and by the preceding though
   independent arrest of the political leaders of the Remonstrants, at the
   instigation of Maurice. Grotius was condemned by the States-General to
   perpetual imprisonment, but escaped through the ingenuity of his wife
   (1621). Van Olden Barneveldt was unjustly condemned to death for
   alleged high-treason, and beheaded at the Hague (May 14, 1619). His
   sons took revenge in a fruitless attempt against the life of Prince
   Maurice.

   The canons of Dort were fully indorsed by the Reformed Church in
   France, and made binding upon the ministers at the Twenty-third
   National Synod at Alais, Oct. 1, 1620, and again at the Twenty-fourth
   Synod at Charenton, Sept., 1623. In other Reformed Churches they were
   received with respect, but not clothed with proper symbolical
   authority. In England there arose considerable opposition. [987] The
   only Church outside of Holland where they are still recognized as a
   public standard of doctrine is the Reformed Dutch Church in America.

   The Synod of Dort is the only Synod of a quasi-oecumenical character in
   the history of the Reformed Churches. In this respect it is even more
   important than the Westminster Assembly of Divines, which was confined
   to England and Scotland, although it produced superior doctrinal
   standards. The judgments of the Synod of Dort differ according to the
   doctrinal stand-point. It was undoubtedly an imposing assembly; and,
   for learning and piety, as respectable as any ever held since the days
   of the Apostles. Breitinger, a great light of the Swiss Churches, was
   astonished at the amount of knowledge and talent displayed by the Dutch
   delegates, and says that if ever the Holy Spirit were present in a
   Council, he was present at Dort. Scultetus, of the Palatinate, thanked
   God that he was a member of that Synod, and placed it high above
   similar assemblies. Meyer, a delegate of Basle, whenever afterwards he
   spoke of this Synod, uncovered his head and exclaimed 'Sacrosancta
   Synodus! Even Paolo Sarpi, the liberal Catholic historian, in a letter
   to Heinsius, spoke very highly of it. A century later, the celebrated
   Dutch divine, Campegius Vitringa, said: 'So much learning was never
   before assembled in one place, not even at Trent.' [988]

   On the other hand, the Remonstrants, who had no fair hearing, abhorred
   the Synod of Dort on account of its Calvinism and intolerance. The
   Lutherans were averse to it under the false impression that the
   condemnation of Arminianism was aimed at their own creed. Some secular
   historians denounce it as a Calvinistic tribunal of inquisition. [989]

   The Canons of Dort have for Calvinism the same significance which the
   Formula of Concord has for Lutheranism. Both betray a very high order
   of theological ability and care. Both are consistent and necessary
   developments. Both exerted a powerful conservative influence on these
   Churches. Both prepared the way for a dry scholasticism which runs into
   subtle abstractions, and resolves the living soul of divinity into a
   skeleton of formulas and distinctions. Both consolidated orthodoxy at
   the expense of freedom, sanctioned a narrow confessionalism, and
   widened the breach between the two branches of the Reformation.

   ARMINIANISM AFTER THE SYNOD OF DORT.

   The banishment of the Arminians was of short duration. After the death
   of Prince Maurice of Nassau (1625), and under the reign of his milder
   brother and successor, Frederick Henry, they were allowed to return and
   to establish churches and schools in every town of Holland, which
   became more and more a land of religious toleration and liberty. In
   this respect their principles triumphed over their opponents. [990]
   They founded a famous Theological College at Amsterdam (1630), which
   exists to this day, and has recently been removed to Leyden.

   Peace was not so favorable to their growth as controversy. They
   gradually diminished in number, and are now a very small sect in
   Holland, almost confined to Rotterdam and Amsterdam.

   But their literary and religious influence has gone far beyond their
   organization. Their eminent scholars, Hugo Grotius, Episcopius,
   Limborch, Curcellæus, Clericus (Le Clerc), and Wetstein, have enriched
   exegetical and critical learning, and liberalized theological opinions,
   especially on religious toleration and the salvation of unbaptized
   infants. Arminianism, in some of its advocates, had a leaning towards
   Socinianism, and prepared the way for Rationalism, which prevailed to a
   great extent in the Established Churches of Holland, Geneva, and
   Germany from the end of the last century till the recent reaction in
   favor of orthodox Calvinism and Lutheranism. But many Arminians adhered
   to the original position of a moderated semi-Pelagianism.

   The distinctive Arminian doctrines of sin and grace, free-will and
   predestination, have been extensively adopted in the Episcopal Church
   since the reign of Charles I., and in the last century by the
   Methodists of Great Britain and America, and thereby have attained a
   larger territory and influence than they ever had in the land of their
   birth. [991] Methodism holds to the essential doctrines of the
   Reformation, but also to the five points of Arminianism, with some
   important evangelical modifications.

   [978] Koornheert was Secretarius at Haarlem, and a forerunner of the
   Remonstrants (d. 1590). He attacked the doctrine of Calvin and Beza on
   predestination and the punishment of heretics (1578), wrote against the
   Heidelberg Catechism (1583), and advocated toleration and a reduction
   of the number of articles of faith. His works were published at
   Amsterdam, 1630. See Bayle, art. Koornheert, and Schweizer, Vol. II. p.

   Leyden, who was protected by the civil magistrate, but excommunicated
   by a provincial Synod at Haarlem, 1582. It should be remembered also
   that Erasmus, the advocate of free-will, against Luther, was held in
   high esteem in his native country, and that the views of Castellio,
   Bolsec, and Huber had made some impression.

   § 66. The Remonstrance.

   The Arminian or quinquarticular controversy started with opposition to
   the doctrine of absolute decrees, and moved in the sphere of
   anthropology and soteriology. The peculiar tenets are contained in the
   five points or articles which the Arminians in their 'Remonstrance'
   laid before the estates of Holland in 1610. They relate to
   predestination, the extent of the atonement, the nature of faith, the
   resistibility of grace, and the perseverance of saints.

   The Remonstrance is first negative, and then positive. It rejects five
   Calvinistic propositions, and then asserts the five Arminian
   propositions. The doctrines rejected are thus stated:

   1. That God has, before the fall, and even before the creation of man,
   by an unchangeable decree, foreordained some to eternal life and others
   to eternal damnation, without any regard to righteousness or sin, to
   obedience or disobedience, and simply because it so pleased him, in
   order to show the glory of his righteousness to the one class and his
   mercy to the other. (This is the supralapsarian view.)

   2. That God, in view of the fall, and in just condemnation of our first
   parents and their posterity, ordained to exempt a part of mankind from
   the consequences of the fall, and to save them by his free grace, but
   to leave the rest, without regard to age or moral condition, to their
   condemnation, for the glory of his righteousness. (The sublapsarian
   view.)

   3. That Christ died, not for all men, but only for the elect.

   4. That the Holy Spirit works in the elect by irresistible grace, so
   that they must be converted and be saved; while the grace necessary and
   sufficient for conversion, faith, and salvation is withheld from the
   rest, although they are externally called and invited by the revealed
   will of God.

   5. That those who have received this irresistible grace can never
   totally and finally lose it, but are guided and preserved by the same
   grace to the end.

   These doctrines, the Remonstrants declare, are not contained in the
   Word of God nor in the Heidelberg Catechism, and are unedifying, yea
   dangerous, and should not be preached to Christian people.

   Then the Remonstrance sets forth the five positive articles as follows:

   ARTICLE FIRST.

   Conditional Predestination.--God has immutably decreed, from eternity,
   to save those men who, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, believe in
   Jesus Christ, and by the same grace persevere in the obedience of faith
   to the end; and, on the other hand, to condemn the unbelievers and
   unconverted (John iii. 36).

   Election and condemnation are thus conditioned by foreknowledge, and
   made dependent on the foreseen faith or unbelief of men.

   SECOND ARTICLE.

   Universal Atonement.--Christ, the Saviour of the world, died for all
   men and for every man, and his grace is extended to all. His atoning
   sacrifice is in and of itself sufficient for the redemption of the
   whole world, and is intended for all by God the Father. But its
   inherent sufficiency does not necessarily imply its actual efficiency.
   The grace of God may be resisted, and only those who accept it by faith
   are actually saved. He who is lost, is lost by his own guilt (John iii.
   16; 1 John ii. 2).

   The Arminians agree with the orthodox in holding the doctrine of a
   vicarious or expiatory atonement, in opposition to the Socinians; but
   they soften it down, and represent its direct effect to be to enable
   God, consistently with his justice and veracity, to enter into a new
   covenant with men, under which pardon is conveyed to all men on
   condition of repentance and faith. The immediate effect of Christ's
   death was not the salvation, but only the salvability of sinners by the
   removal of the legal obstacles, and opening the door for pardon and
   reconciliation. They reject the doctrine of a limited atonement, which
   is connected with the supralapsarian view of predestination, but is
   disowned by moderate Calvinists, who differ from the Arminians in all
   other points. Calvin himself says that Christ died sufficienter pro
   omnibus, efficaciter pro electis.

   THIRD ARTICLE.

   Saving Faith.--Man in his fallen state is unable to accomplish any
   thing really and truly good, and therefore also unable to attain to
   saving faith, unless he be regenerated and renewed by God in Christ
   through the Holy Spirit (John xv. 5).

   FOURTH ARTICLE.

   Resistible Grace.--Grace is the beginning, continuation, and end of our
   spiritual life, so that man can neither think nor do any good or resist
   sin without prevening, co-operating, and assisting grace. But as for
   the manner of co-operation, this grace is not irresistible, for many
   resist the Holy Ghost (Acts vii.).

   FIFTH ARTICLE.

   The Uncertainty of Perseverance.--Although grace is sufficient and
   abundant to preserve the faithful through all trials and temptations
   for life everlasting, it has not yet been proved from the Scriptures
   that grace, once given, can never be lost.

   On this point the disciples of Arminius went further, and taught the
   possibility of a total and final fall of believers from grace. They
   appealed to such passages where believers are warned against this very
   danger, and to such examples as Solomon and Judas. They moreover
   denied, with the Roman Catholics, that any body can have a certainty of
   salvation except by special revelation.

   These five points the Remonstrants declare to be in harmony with the
   Word of God, edifying and, as far as they go, sufficient for salvation.
   They protest against the charge of changing the Christian Reformed
   religion, and claim toleration and legal protection for their doctrine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 67. The Canons of Dort.

   The Canons of Dort are likewise confined to five points or 'Heads of
   Doctrine,' and exhibit what is technically called the Calvinistic
   system--first positively, then negatively, in the rejection of the
   Arminian errors. [992] Each Head of Doctrine (subdivided into Articles)
   is subscribed by the Dutch and foreign delegates.

   FIRST HEAD OF DOCTRINE.

   Of Divine Predestination.--Since all men sinned in Adam and lie under
   the curse [according to the Augustinian system held by all the
   Reformers], God would have done no injustice if he had left them to
   their merited punishment; but in his infinite mercy he provided a
   salvation through the gospel of Christ, that those who believe in him
   may not perish, but have eternal life. That some receive the gift of
   faith from God and others not, proceeds from God's eternal decree of
   election and reprobation.

   Election is the unchangeable purpose of God whereby, before the
   foundation of the world, he has, out of mere grace, according to the
   sovereign good pleasure of his own will, chosen from the whole human
   race, which has fallen through their own fault from their primitive
   state of rectitude into sin and destruction, a certain number of
   persons to redemption in Christ, whom he from eternity appointed the
   Mediator and Head of the elect, and the foundation of salvation. These
   elect, though neither better nor more deserving than others, God has
   decreed to give to Christ to be saved by him, and bestow upon them true
   faith, conversion, justification and sanctification, perseverance to
   the end, and final glory (Eph. i. 4, 5, 6; Rom. viii. 30).

   Election is absolute and unconditional. It is not founded upon foreseen
   faith and holiness, as the prerequisite condition on which it depended;
   on the contrary, it is the fountain of faith, holiness, and eternal
   life itself. God has chosen us, not because we are holy, but to the end
   that we should be holy (Eph. i. 4; Rom. ix. 11-13; Acts xiii. 38). As
   God is unchangeable, so his election is unchangeable, and the elect can
   neither be cast away nor their number be diminished. The sense and
   certainty of election is a constant stimulus to humility and gratitude.

   The non-elect are simply left to the just condemnation of their own
   sins. This is the decree of reprobation, which by no means makes God
   the author of sin (the very thought of which is blasphemy), but
   declares him to be an awful, irreprehensible, and righteous judge and
   avenger (Cat. Ch. I. Art. 15).

   SECOND HEAD OF DOCTRINE.

   Of the Death of Christ. [Limited Atonement.]--According to the
   sovereign counsel of God, the saving efficacy of the atoning death of
   Christ extends to all the elect [and to them only], so as to bring them
   infallibly to salvation. But, intrinsically, the sacrifice and
   satisfaction of Christ is of infinite worth and value, abundantly
   sufficient to expiate the sins of the whole world. This death derives
   its infinite value and dignity from these considerations; because the
   person who submitted to it was not only really man and perfectly holy,
   but also the only-begotten Son of God, of the same eternal and infinite
   essence with the Father and Holy Spirit, which qualifications were
   necessary to constitute him a Saviour for us; and because it was
   attended with a sense of the wrath and curse of God due to us for sin.

   Moreover the promise of the gospel is, that whosoever believeth in
   Christ crucified shall not perish, but have everlasting life. This
   promise, together with the command to repent and believe, ought to be
   declared and published to all nations, and to all persons promiscuously
   and without distinction, to whom God out of his good pleasure sends the
   gospel.

   And, whereas many who are called by the gospel do not repent nor
   believe in Christ, but perish in unbelief; this is not owing to any
   defect or insufficiency in the sacrifice offered by Christ upon the
   cross, but is wholly to be imputed to themselves. [993]

   THIRD AND FOURTH HEADS OF DOCTRINE.

   Of the Corruption of Man, his Conversion to God, and the Manner
   thereof.--Man was originally formed after the image of God. His
   understanding was adorned with a true and saving knowledge of his
   Creator, and of spiritual things; his heart and will were upright, all
   his affections pure, and the whole Man was holy; but revolting from God
   by the instigation of the devil, and abusing the freedom of his own
   will, he forfeited these excellent gifts, and on the contrary entailed
   on himself blindness of mind, horrible darkness, vanity, and
   perverseness of judgment; became wicked, rebellious, and obdurate in
   heart and will, and impure in [all] his affections.

   Man after the fall begat children in his own likeness. A corrupt stock
   produced a corrupt offspring. Hence all the posterity of Adam, Christ
   only excepted, have derived corruption from their original parent, not
   by imitation, as the Pelagians of old asserted, but by the propagation
   of a vicious nature in consequence of a just judgment of God.

   Therefore all men are conceived in sin, and are by nature children of
   wrath, incapable of any saving good, prone to evil, dead in sin, and in
   bondage thereto; and, without the regenerating grace of the Holy
   Spirit, they are neither able nor willing to return to God, to reform
   the depravity of their nature, nor to dispose themselves to
   reformation.

   What, therefore, neither the light of nature nor the law could do, that
   God performs by the operation of his Holy Spirit through the word or
   ministry of reconciliation: which is the glad tidings concerning the
   Messiah, by means whereof it hath pleased God to save such as believe,
   as well under the Old as under the New Testament.

   As many as are called by the gospel are unfeignedly called; for God
   hath most earnestly and truly declared in his Word what will be
   acceptable to him, namely, that all who are called should comply with
   the invitation. He, moreover, seriously promises eternal life and rest
   to as many as shall come to him, and believe on him.

   It is not the fault of the gospel, nor of Christ offered therein, nor
   of God, who calls men by the gospel, and confers upon them various
   gifts, that those who are called by the ministry of the Word refuse to
   come and be converted. The fault lies in themselves.

   But that others who are called by the gospel obey the call must be
   wholly ascribed to God, who, as he hath chosen his own from eternity in
   Christ, so he calls them effectually in time, confers upon them faith
   and repentance, rescues them from the power of darkness, and translates
   them into the kingdom of his own Son, that they may show forth the
   praises of him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvelous
   light; and may glory not in themselves but in the Lord, according to
   the testimony of the Apostles in various places.

   Faith is therefore the gift of God, not on account of its being offered
   by God to man, to be accepted or rejected at his pleasure, but because
   it is in reality conferred, breathed, and infused into him; nor even
   because God bestows the power or ability to believe, and then expects
   that man should, by the exercise of his own free will, consent to the
   terms of salvation, and actually believe in Christ; but because he who
   works in man both to will and to do, and indeed all things in all,
   produces both the will to believe and the act of believing also.

   FIFTH HEAD OF DOCRINE.

   Of the Perseverance of the Saints.--Whom God calls, according to his
   purpose, to the communion of his Son our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   regenerates by the Holy Spirit, he delivers also from the dominion and
   slavery of sin in this life; though not altogether from the body of sin
   and from the infirmities of the flesh, so long as they continue in this
   world.

   By reason of these remains of indwelling sin, and the temptations of
   sin and of the world, those who are converted could not persevere in a
   state of grace if left to their own strength. But God is faithful, who
   having conferred grace, mercifully confirms and powerfully preserves
   them therein, even to the end.

   Of this preservation of the elect to salvation, and of their
   perseverance in the faith, true believers for themselves may and do
   obtain assurance according to the measure of their faith, whereby they
   arrive at the certain persuasion that they ever will continue true and
   living members of the Church; and that they experience forgiveness of
   sins, and will at last inherit eternal life.

   This certainty of perseverance, however, is so far from exciting in
   believers a spirit of pride, or of rendering them carnally secure,
   that, on the contrary, it is the real source of humility, filial
   reverence, true piety, patience in every tribulation, fervent prayers,
   constancy in suffering and in confessing the truth, and of solid
   rejoicing in God; so that the consideration of this benefit should
   serve as an incentive to the serious and constant practice of gratitude
   and good works, as appears from the testimonies of Scripture and the
   examples of the saints.

   In opposition to the Canons of Dort, Episcopius prepared a lengthy
   defense of the Arminian Articles and a confession of faith in Dutch,
   1621, and in Latin, 1622. It claims no binding symbolical authority,
   and advocates liberty and toleration. [994]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [992] The term 'rejectio errorum,' instead of the condemnation and
   anathemas of the Greek and Roman Churches in dealing with heresies,
   indicates that Protestant orthodoxy is more liberal and charitable than
   the Catholic.

   [993] The advocates of a limited atonement reason from the effect to
   the cause, and make the divine intention co-extensive with the actual
   application; but they can give no satisfactory explanation of such
   passages as John iii. 16 ('God so loved the world,' which never means
   the elect only, but all mankind); 1 John ii. 2 ('Christ is the
   propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world'); 1 Tim. ii. 4; 2 Pet. iii. 9. All admit, however,
   with the Articles of Dort, that the intrinsic value of the atonement,
   being the act of the God-man, is infinite and sufficient to cover the
   sins of all men. Dr. W. Cunningham says: 'The value or worth of
   Christ's sacrifice of himself depends upon, and is measured by, the
   dignity of his person, and is therefore infinite. Though many fewer of
   the human race had been to be pardoned and saved, an atonement of
   infinite value would have been necessary, in order to procure for them
   these blessings; and though many more, yea, all men, had been to be
   pardoned and saved, the death of Christ, being an atonement of infinite
   value, would have been amply sufficient, as the ground or basis of
   their forgiveness or salvation' (Historical Theol. Vol. II. p. 331).
   Similarly, Dr. Hodge, Vol. II. pp. 544 sqq. After such admissions the
   difference of the two theories is of little practical account. Full
   logical consistency would require us to measure the value of Christ's
   atonement by the extent of its actual benefit or availability, and
   either to expand or to contract it according to the number of the
   elect; but such an opinion is derogatory to the dignity of Christ, and
   is held by very few extreme Calvinists of little or no influence.
   Cunningham says (p. 331): 'There is no doubt that all the most eminent
   Calvinistic divines hold the infinite worth or value of Christ's
   atonement--its full sufficiency for expiating all the sins of all men.'

   THE REFORMED CHURCH IN GERMANY.

   The mighty genius of Luther, aided by the learning of Melanchthon,
   controlled the German Reformation at first to the exclusion of every
   other influence; and if Lutheranism had not assumed a hostile and
   uncompromising attitude towards Zwinglianism, Calvinism, and the later
   theology of Melanchthon, it would probably have prevailed throughout
   the German empire, as the Reformed creed prevailed in all the
   Protestant cantons of Switzerland. But the bitter eucharistic
   controversies and the triumph of rigid Lutheranism in the Formula of
   Concord over Melanchthonianism drove some of the fairest portions of
   Germany, especially the Palatinate and Brandenburg, into the Reformed
   communion.

   The German branch of the Reformed family grew up under the combined
   influences of Zwingli, Calvin, and Melanchthon. Zwingli's reformation
   extended to the southern portions of Germany bordering on Switzerland,
   especially the free imperial cities of Strasburg, Constance, Lindau,
   Memmingen, and Ulm. It is stated that the majority of the Protestant
   citizens of Augsburg during the Diet of 1530 sympathized with him
   rather than with Luther. Calvin spent nearly three years at Strasburg
   (1538-41), and exerted a great influence on scholars through his
   writings. Melanchthon (who was a native of the Palatinate), in his
   later period, emancipated himself gradually from the authority of
   Luther, and sympathized with Calvin in the sacramental question, while
   in the doctrines of divine sovereignty and human freedom he pursued an
   independent course. He trained the principal author of the Heidelberg
   Catechism (Ursinus), reorganized the University of Heidelberg (1557),
   which became the Wittenberg of the Reformed Church in Germany, and
   threw on several occasions the weight of his influence against the
   exclusive type of Lutheranism advocated by such men as Flacius,
   Heshusius, and Westphal. He impressed upon the German Reformed Church
   his mild, conciliatory spirit and tendency towards union, which, at a
   later period, prevailed also in a large part of the Lutheran Church.
   The German Reformed Church, then, occupies a mediating position between
   Calvinism and Lutheranism. It adopts substantially the Calvinistic
   creed, but without the doctrine of reprobation (which is left to
   private opinion), and without its strict discipline; while it shares
   with the Lutheran Church the German language, nationality, hymnology,
   and mystic type of piety. [995] The great majority of German Reformed
   congregations have, since 1817, under the lead of the royal house of
   Prussia, been absorbed in what is called the Evangelical or United
   Evangelical Church. The aim of this union was originally to substitute
   one Church for two, but the result has been to add a third Church to
   the Lutheran and Reformed, since these still continue their separate
   existence in Germany and among the German emigrants in other countries.
   [996]

   BUCER.

   Among the framers of the character of the Reformed Church in Germany,
   Martin Bucer (Butzer), [997] Wolfgang Fabricius Capito, and Caspar
   Hedio occupy the next place after Zwingli, Calvin, and Melanchthon.
   Bucer (1491-1551), the learned and devoted reformer of Strasburg, and a
   facile diplomatist, was a personal friend of Zwingli, Luther, and
   Calvin, and a mediator between the Swiss and the German Reformation, as
   also between Continental and Anglican Protestantism. He labored with
   indefatigable zeal for an evangelical union, and hoped to attain it by
   elastic compromise formulas (like the Wittenberg Concordia of 1536),
   which concealed the real difference, and in the end satisfied neither
   party. He drew up with Melanchthon the plan of a reformation in Cologne
   at the request of the archbishop. During the Interim troubles he
   accepted a call to England, aided Cranmer in his reforms, and died as
   Professor of Theology at Cambridge, universally lamented. In the reign
   of Bloody Mary he was formally condemned as a heretic, his bones were
   dug up and publicly burned (Feb. 6, 1556); but Elizabeth solemnly
   restored the 'blessed' memory of 'the dear martyrs Martin Bucer and
   Paul Fagius.' In attainments and fertility as a writer he was not
   surpassed in his age. [998]

   THE CONFESSION OF THE FOUR CITIES.

   The oldest Confession of the Reformed Church in Germany is the
   Tetrapolitan Confession, also called the Strasburg and the Swabian
   Confession. [999]

   It was prepared in great haste, during the sessions of the Diet of
   Augsburg in 1530, by Bucer, with the aid of Capito and Hedio, in the
   name of the four imperial cities (hence the name) of Strasburg,
   Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau which, on account of their sympathy
   with Zwinglianism, were excluded by the Lutherans from their political
   and theological conferences, and from the Protestant League. They would
   greatly have preferred to unite with the Lutherans in a common
   confession; but at that time even Melanchthon was more anxious to
   conciliate the Papists than the Zwinglians and Anabaptists; and of the
   Lutheran princes the Landgrave Philip of Hesse was the only one who,
   from a broad, statesman-like view of the critical situation, favored a
   solid union of the Protestants against the common foe, but in vain.
   Hence after the Lutherans had presented their Confession, June 25, and
   Zwingli his own, July 8, the Four Cities handed theirs, July 11, to the
   Emperor, in German and Latin. It was not read before the Diet, but a
   Confutation full of misrepresentations was prepared by Faber and
   Cochläus, and read October 24 (or 17). The Strasburg divines were not
   even favored with a copy of this Confutation, but procured one
   secretly, and answered it by a 'Vindication and Defense' (as
   Melanchthon wrote his Apology of the Augsburg Confession during the
   Diet). The Confession and Apology, after being withheld for a year from
   print for the sake of peace, were officially published in both
   languages at Strasburg in the autumn of 1531. [1000]

   The Tetrapolitan Confession consists of twenty-three chapters, besides
   Preface and Conclusion. It is in doctrine and arrangement closely
   conformed to the Lutheran Confession of Augsburg, and breathes the same
   spirit of moderation. The Reformed element, however, appears in the
   first chapter (On the Matter of Preaching), in the declaration that
   nothing should be taught in the pulpit but what was either expressly
   contained in the Holy Scriptures or fairly deduced therefrom. [1001]
   (The Lutheran Confession, probably from prudential and irenical
   considerations, is silent on the supreme authority of the Scriptures.)
   The evangelical doctrine of justification is stated in the third and
   fourth chapters more clearly than by Melanchthon, namely, that we are
   justified not by works of our own, but solely by the grace of God and
   the merits of Christ through a living faith, which is active in love
   and productive of good works. Images are rejected in Ch. XXII. The
   doctrine of the Lord's Supper (Ch. XVIII.) is couched in dubious
   language, which was intended to comprehend in substance the Lutheran
   and the Zwinglian theories, and contains the germ of the view
   afterwards more clearly and fully developed by Calvin. In this
   ordinance, it is said, Christ offers to his followers, as truly now as
   at the institution, his very body and blood as spiritual food and
   drink, whereby their souls are nourished to everlasting life. [1002]
   Nothing is said of the oral manducation and the fruition of
   unbelievers, which are the distinctive features of the Lutheran view.
   Bucer, who had attended the Conference at Marburg in 1529, labored with
   great zeal afterwards to bring about a doctrinal compromise between the
   contending theories, but without effect.

   We may regard the Strasburg Confession as the first attempt at an
   evangelical union symbol. But Bucer's love for union was an obstacle to
   the success of his confession, which never took deep root; for in the
   Reformed Churches it was soon superseded by the clearer and more
   logical confessions of the Calvinistic type, and the four cities
   afterwards signed the Lutheran Confession to join the Smalcald League.
   Bucer himself remained true to his creed, and reconfessed it in his
   last will and testament (1548), and on his death-bed. [1003]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [995] Dr. Heppe, in his numerous and learned works on the history and
   theology of the German Reformation period, endeavors to identify the
   German Reformed Church with Melanchthonianism (which was only an
   element in it), and Melanchthonianism with original German
   Protestantism (which was prevailingly Lutheran in the strict sense of
   the term), thus overestimating the influence of Melanchthon and
   underrating the influence of Zwingli and Calvin. His books are very
   valuable, but one-sided, and must be supplemented by the writings of
   Alex. Schweizer (Die Centraldogmen) and others on the same subject.

   [996] The large German Protestant population of the United States is
   divided among Lutherans (the most numerous), German Reformed, and
   Evangelicals (or Unionists). A considerable number is connected with
   English denominations, especially the Methodists and Presbyterians.

   [997] He wrote his name in German Butzer (i.e., Cleanser, from putzen,
   to cleanse), in Latin Bucerus, in Greek Boukeros. See Baum, l.c. p. 88.

   [998] See a chronological list of his very numerous printed works in
   Baum, pp. 586 sqq. Baum says: 'An Fruchtbarkeit kommt ihm [Bucer] kaum
   Luther gleich, trots dem dass er bei weitem mehr als Luther, ja in
   seiner letzten Lebensperiode beinahe beständig, auf Reisen, Conventen,
   Reichstagen und Colloquien, in befreundeten Städten und Orten als
   Organisator der Kirchenreformation abwesend und in Anspruch genommen
   war. Mit einer beispiellosen Elasticität des Geistes angethan, mit
   einem fieberhaftigen Thätigkeitstriebe behaftet, schrieb er, vermöge
   des ungemeinen Reichthums seiner Kenntnisse mit solcher fabelhaften
   Leichtigkeit und Unleserlichkeit, dass nicht allein zu dem Meisten was
   von Anderen gelesen werden sollte, ein mit seiner die Worte blos
   andeutenden Schrift genau vertrauter Amanuensis nothwendig war, sondern
   dass er auch neben seinen Amtsgeschäften noch bei weitem mehr förderte
   als zwei der geübtesten Schreiber in's Reine bringen konnten. Er hat
   umfangreiche Bücher auf seinen Reisen geschrieben.' His best
   amanuensis, Conrad Huber, began a complete edition of his works, of
   which the first volume only appeared at Basle, 1577 (959 pages, folio).
   It is called Tomus Anglicanus, because it contains mostly the books
   which Bucer wrote in England. Many of his MSS. are preserved in
   Strasburg and in England.

   as follows: 'Confessio Religionis Ckristianæ Sacratissimo Imperatori

   Niemeyer, Proleg. pp. lxxxiv. sq. A new German translation from the
   Latin is given in Walch's edition of Luther's Works, Vol. XX. pp.
   1966-2008.

   [1001] 'Mandavimus iis, qui concionandi apud nos munere fungebantur, ut
   nihil aliud quam quæ sacris literis aut continentur, aut certe
   nituntur, e suggestu docerent. Videbatur namque nobis haud indignum, eo
   in illo tanto discrimine confugere, quo confugerunt olim et semper, non
   solum sanctissimi Patres, Episcopi, et Principes, sed quilibet etiam
   privati, nempe ad authoritatem Scripturæ arcanæ. Ad quam nobiliores
   Thessalonicensium auditum Christi Evangelium explorasse, divus Lucas
   cum laude illorum memorat, in qua Paulus summo studio versari suum
   Timotheum voluit, sine cuius authoritate, nulli Pontifices suis
   decretis obedientiam, nulli patres suis scriptis fidem, nulli denique
   Principes suis legibus authoritatem unquam postularunt, ex qua demum
   ducendas sacras conciones, et magnum Sacri Imperii concilium
   Nurembergæ, anno Christi M.D.XXIII. celebratum sancivit. Si enim verum
   divus Paulus testatus est, per divinam Scripturam hominem Dei penitus
   absolvi, atque ad omne opus bonum instrui, nihil poterit is veritatis
   Christianæ, nihil doctrinæ salutaris desiderare, Scripturam qui
   consulere religiose studeat.'

   [1002] 'De hoc venerando corporis et sanguinis Christi sacramento
   omnia, quæ de illo Evangelistæ, Paulus et sancti Patres scripta
   reliquerunt, nostri fide optima docent, commendant, inculcant. Indeque

   qua is non minus hodie, quam in novissima illa coena, omnibus qui inter

   instituit repetunt, verum suum corpus, verumque suum sanguinem, vere
   edendum et bibendum, in cibum potumque animarum, quo illæ in æternam
   vitam alantur, dare per sacramenta dignatur, ut jam ipse in illis, et
   illi in ipso vivant et permaneant, in die novissimo, in novam et
   immortalem vitam per ipsum resuscitandi, juxta sua illa æternæ
   veritatis verba: "Accipite et manducate, hoc est corpus meum," etc.
   "Bibite ex eo omnes, hic calix est sanguis meus," etc. Præcipua vero
   diligentia populi animos, nostri ecclesiastæ ab omni tum contentione,
   tum supervacanea et curiosa disquisitione, ad illud revocant, quod
   solum prodest, solumque a Christo servatore nostro spectatum est, nempe
   ut ipso pasti, in ipso et per ipsum vivamus, vitam Deo placitam,
   sanctam, et ideo perennem quoque et beatam, simusque inter nos omnes
   unus panis, unum corpus, qui de uno pane in sacra coena participamus.
   Quo sane factum est, ut divina sacramenta, sacrosancta Christi coena,
   quam religiosissime, reverentiaque singulari apud nos et
   administrentur, et sumantur.' Ebrard (Kirchen- und Dogmengeschichte,
   Vol. III. p. 93) says of Bucer, that he had the theological elements
   for a true doctrinal union of the Lutheran and Reformed views of the
   eucharist. 'In der richtigen exegetisehen Grundlage völlig mit Zwingli
   einig, brachte er das Element, welches auch in Zwingli keimartig
   vorhanden gewesen, aber in der Hitze des Streites ganz zurückgetreten
   war--die Lebensgemeinschaft oder unio mystica mit der Person
   Christi--im Sinne der Tetrapolitana (d.i. im Sinne der nachherigen
   calvinisch-melanchthonischen Lehre) zur Entwicklung.'

   § 69. The Heidelberg Catechism. A.D. 1563.

   Literature.

   I. Standard Editions of the Catechism.

   Official German editions of 1563 (three), 1585, 1595, 1684, 1724, 1863
   (American). The original title is 'Catechismus | Oder | Christlicher
   Underricht, | wieder in Kirchen und Schu- | len der Churfürstlichen |
   Pfaltz getrieben | wirdt. | Gedruckt in der Churfürstli- | chen Stad
   Heydelberg, durch | Johannem Mayer. | 1563.' With the Electoral arms.
   95 pages.

   There is but one copy of the first edition known to exist, and this did
   not come into public notice till 1864. It belonged to Prof. Hermann
   Wilken, of Heidelberg, whose name it bears, with the date 1563; was
   bought by Dr. Treviranus, of Bremen, in 1823, given by him to Dr.
   Menken, bought back after Menken's death, 1832, and is now in the
   University Library at Utrecht. I examined it in October and November,
   1865, at Bremen. It has the remark, 'Diesses ist die allererste
   Edition, in welcher Pag. 55 die 80ste Frag und Antwort nicht gefunden
   wirdt. Auff Churfürstlichen Befehl eingezogen. Liber rarissimus.' The
   Scripture texts are quoted in the margin, but only the chapters, since
   the versicular division (which first appeared in Stephens's Greek
   Testament of 1551) had not yet come into general use. A quasi
   fac-simile of this copy was issued by the Rev. Albrecht Wolters, then
   at Bonn (now at Halle), under the title, 'Der Heidelberger Katechismus
   in seiner ursprünglichen Gestalt, herausgegeben nebst der Geschichte
   seines Textes im Jahre 1563.' Bonn, 1864. Comp. his art. in the Studien
   und Kritiken for 1867, pp. 1, 2.

   Niemeyer, in his collection of Reformed Confessions, pp. 390 sqq.,
   gives, besides the Latin text, a faithful reprint of the third German
   edition, with the eightieth question in full.

   Philipp Schaff: Der Heidelberger Katechismus. Nach der ersten Ausgabe
   von 1563 revidirt und mit kritischen Anmerkungen, sowie einer
   Geschichte und Charakteristik des Katechismus versehen. Philadelphia
   (J. Kohler), 1863; second edition, revised and enlarged, 1866. This
   edition was prepared for the tercentenary celebration of the Heidelberg
   Catechism, and gives the received text of the third edition with the
   readings of the first and second editions, and the Scripture proofs in
   full.

   The Latin translation was published in 1563, and again in 1566, under
   the title, 'Cate- | chesis Religio- | nis Christianæ, | quæ traditur in
   Ecclesiis | et Scholis Pala- | tinatus. | Heydelbergæ. | Excusum anno
   post Christum | natum M.D.LXVI.' I saw a copy of this ed. Latina, in
   the library of the late Dr. Treviranus, in Bremen (1865). On the
   title-page the words are written, 'Editio rara et originalis;' also the
   name of G. Menken, the former owner. The Scripture references are
   marked on the margin, including the verses. The eightieth question is
   complete (with 'execranda idololatia'), pp. 62 and 63, and supported by
   many Scripture texts and the Can. Missæ. The questions are divided into
   fifty-two Sundays. 'Precationes aliquot privatæ et publicæ,' a
   'Precatio scholastica,' and some versified prayers of Joachim
   Camerarius (the friend and biographer of Melanchthon), are added.

   The best English, or rather American, edition of the Catechism is the
   stately triglot tercentenary edition prepared at the direction of the
   German Reformed Church in the United States, by a committee consisting
   of E. V. Gerhart, D.D., John W. Nevin, D.D., Henry Harbaugh, D.D., John
   S. Kessler, D.D., Daniel Zacharias, D.D., and three laymen, and issued
   under the title, 'The Heidelberg Catechism, in German, Latin, and
   English; with an Historical Introduction (by Dr. Nevin), New York
   (Charles Scribner), 1863.' 4to. The German text is a reprint of the
   third edition after Niemeyer, with the German in modern spelling added;
   the English translation is made directly from the German original, and
   is far better than the one in popular use, which was made from the
   Latin. It is the most elegant and complete edition of the Catechism
   ever published, but it appeared before the discovery of the editio
   princeps, and repeats the error concerning the eightieth question (see
   Introd. p. 38).

   II. Commentaries.

   The commentaries and sermons on the Heidelberg Catechism are
   exceedingly numerous, especially in the German and Dutch languages. The
   first and most valuable is from the chief author, Zach. Ursinus: Corpus
   Doctrinæ orthodoxæ, or Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism, ed. by
   his pupil, David Pareus, and repeatedly published at Heidelberg and
   elsewhere--1591, 1618, etc.--in Latin, German, Dutch, and English. An
   American edition, on the basis of the English translation of Bishop Dr.
   H. Parry, was issued by Dr. Williard (President of Heidelberg College,
   Tiffin, O.), Columbus, O. 1850. Other standard commentaries are by
   Coccejus (1671), d'Outrein (1719), Lampe (1721), Stähelin (1724), and
   van Alpen (1800). See a fuller list by Harbaugh in 'Mercersb. Rev.' for
   1860, pp. 601-625, and in Bethune's Lectures.

   THE REFORMATION IN THE PALATINATE.

   The Palatinate, one of the finest provinces of Germany, on both sides
   of the upper Rhine, was one of the seven electorates
   (Kurfürstenthümer), whose rulers, in the name of the German people,
   elected the Emperor of Germany. After the dissolution of the old empire
   (1806) it ceased to be a politico-geographical name, and its territory
   is now divided between Baden, Bavaria, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and
   Prussia. Its capital was Heidelberg (from 1231 till 1720), famous for
   its charming situation at the foot of the Königsstuhl, on the banks of
   the Swabian river Neckar, for its picturesque castle, and for its
   university (founded in 1346).

   Luther made a short visit to Heidelberg in 1518, and defended certain
   evangelical theses. In 1546, the year of Luther's death, the
   Reformation was introduced under the Elector Frederick II. Melanchthon,
   who was a native of the Palatinate, and twice received a call to a
   professorship of theology at Heidelberg (1546 and 1557), but declined,
   acted as the chief counselor in the work, and aided, on a personal
   visit in 1557, in reorganizing the university on an evangelical basis
   under Otto Henry (1556-59). He may therefore be called the Reformer of
   the Palatinate. He impressed upon it the character of a moderate
   Lutheranism friendly to Calvinism. The Augsburg Confession was adopted
   as the doctrinal basis, and the cultus was remodeled (as also in the
   neighboring Duchy of Würtemberg) after Zwinglian simplicity. Heidelberg
   now began to attract Protestant scholars from different countries, and
   became a battle-ground of Lutheran, Philippist, Calvinist, and
   Zwinglian views. The conflict was enkindled as usual by the zeal for
   the real presence. Tilemann Heshusius, whom Melanchthon, without
   knowing his true character, had recommended to a theological chair
   (1558), introduced, as General Superintendent, exclusive Lutheranism,
   excommunicated Deacon Klebitz for holding the Zwinglian view, and even
   fought with him at the altar about the communion cup. This public
   scandal was the immediate occasion of the Heidelberg Catechism.

   FREDERICK III.

   During this controversy Frederick III., surnamed the Pious (1515-1576),
   became Elector of the Palatinate, 1559. He made it the chief object of
   his reign to carry out the reformation begun by his predecessors. He
   tried at first to conciliate the parties, and asked the advice of
   Melanchthon, who, a few months before his death, counseled peace,
   moderation, and Biblical simplicity, and warned against extreme and
   scholastic subtleties in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. [1004] He
   deposed both Heshusius and Klebitz, arranged a public disputation
   (June, 1560) on the eucharist, decided in favor of the Melanchthonian
   or Calvinistic view, called distinguished foreign divines to the
   university, and intrusted two of them with the composition of the
   Heidelberg Catechism, which was to secure harmony of teaching and to
   lay a solid foundation for the religious instruction of the rising
   generation.

   Frederick was one of the purest and noblest characters among the
   princes of Germany. He was to the Palatinate what King Alfred and
   Edward VI. were to England, what the Electors Frederick the Wise and
   John the Constant were to Saxony, and Duke Christopher to Würtemberg.
   He did more for educational and charitable institutions than all his
   predecessors. He devoted to them the entire proceeds of the oppressed
   convents. He lived in great simplicity that he might contribute
   liberally from his private income to the cause of learning and
   religion. He was the first German prince who professed the Reformed
   Creed, as distinct from the Lutheran. For this he suffered much
   reproach, and was threatened with exclusion from the benefits of the
   Augsburg Treaty of Peace (concluded in 1555), since Zwinglianism and
   Calvinism were not yet tolerated on German soil. But at the Diet of
   Augsburg, in 1566, he made before the Emperor a manly confession of his
   faith, and declared himself ready to lose his crown rather than violate
   his conscience. Even his opponents could not but admire his courage,
   and the Lutheran Elector Augustus of Saxony applauded him, saying,
   'Fritz, thou art more pious than all of us.' He praised God on his
   death-bed that he had been permitted to see such a reformation in
   Church and school that men were led away from human traditions to
   Christ and his divine Word. He left in writing a full confession of his
   faith, which may be regarded as an authentic explanation of the
   Heidelberg Catechism; it was published after his death by his son, John
   Casimir (1577).

   URSINUS AND OLEVIANUS.

   Frederick showed his wisdom by calling two young divines, Ursinus and
   Olevianus, to Heidelberg to aid in the Reformation and to prepare an
   evangelical catechism. They belong to the reformers of the second
   generation. Theirs it was to nurture and to mature rather than to
   plant. Both were Germans, but well acquainted with the Reformed
   Churches in Switzerland and France. Both suffered deposition and exile
   for the Reformed faith.

   Zacharias Ursinus (Bär), the chief author of the Heidelberg Catechism,
   was born at Breslau, July 18, 1534, and studied seven years (1550-1557)
   at Wittenberg under Melanchthon, who esteemed him as one of his best
   pupils and friends. He accompanied his teacher to the religious
   conference at Worms, 1557, and to Heidelberg, and then proceeded on a
   literary journey to Switzerland and France. He made the personal
   acquaintance of Bullinger and Peter Martyr at Zurich, of Calvin and
   Beza at Geneva, and was thoroughly initiated into the Reformed Creed.
   Calvin presented him with his works, and wrote in them the best wishes
   for his young friend. On his return to Wittenberg he received a call to
   the rectorship of the Elizabeth College at Breslau. After the death of
   Melanchthon he went a second time to Zurich (Oct., 1560), intending to
   remain there. In the following year he was called to a theological
   chair at Heidelberg. Here he labored with untiring zeal and success
   till the death of Frederick III., 1576, when, together with six hundred
   steadfast Reformed ministers and teachers, he was deposed and exiled by
   Louis VI., who introduced the Lutheran Creed. Ursinus found a refuge at
   Neustadt an der Hardt, and established there, with other deposed
   professors, a flourishing theological school under the protection of
   John Casimir, the second son of Frederick III. He died in the prime of
   his life and usefulness, March 6, 1583, leaving a widow and one son. In
   the same year Casimir succeeded his Lutheran brother in the Electorate,
   recalled the exiled preachers, and re-established the Reformed Church
   in the Palatinate.

   Ursinus was a man of profound classical, philosophical, and theological
   learning, poetic taste, rare gift of teaching, and fervent piety. His
   devotion to Christ is beautifully reflected in the first question of
   the Heidelberg Catechism, and in his saying that he would not take a
   thousand worlds for the blessed assurance of being owned by Jesus
   Christ. He was no orator, and no man of action, but a retired, modest,
   and industrious student. [1005] His principal works, besides the
   Catechism, are a Commentary on the Catechism (Corpus doctrinæ
   orthodoxæ) and a defense of the Reformed Creed against the attacks of
   the Lutheran Formula of Concord.

   Caspar Olevianus (Olewig), born at Treves Aug. 10,1536, studied the
   ancient languages at Paris, Bourges, and Orleans, and theology at
   Geneva and Zurich. He enjoyed, like Ursinus, the personal instruction
   and friendship of the surviving reformers of Switzerland. He began to
   preach the evangelical doctrines at Treves, was thrown into prison, but
   soon released, and called to Heidelberg, 1560, by Frederick III., who
   felt under personal obligation to him for saving one of his sons from
   drowning at the risk of his own life. He taught theology and preached
   at the court. He was the chief counselor of the Elector in all affairs
   of the Church. In 1576 he was banished on account of his faith, and
   accepted a call to Herborn, 1584, where he died, Feb. 27, 1585. His
   last word was a triumphant 'certissimus,' in reply to a friend who
   asked him whether he were certain of his salvation. Theodore Beza
   lamented his death in a Latin poem, beginning

   'Eheu, quibus suspiriis,

   Eheu, quibus te lacrymis

   Oleviane, planxero?'

   Olevianus was inferior to Ursinus in learning, but his superior in the
   pulpit and in church government. He wrote an important catechetical
   work on the covenant of grace, and is regarded as the forerunner of the
   federal theology of Coccejus and Lampe. He labored earnestly, but only
   with moderate success, for the introduction of the Presbyterian form of
   government and a strict discipline, after the model of Geneva. Thomas
   Erastus (Lieber), Professor of Medicine at Heidelberg, and afterwards
   of Ethics at Basle (died 1583), opposed excommunication, and defended
   the supremacy of the state in matters of religion; hence the term
   'Erastianism' (equivalent to Cæsaropapism).

   PREPARATION AND PUBLICATION OF THE CATECHISM.

   The Heidelberg Catechism, as it is called after the city of its birth,
   or the Palatinate (also Palatine) Catechism, as it is named after the
   country for which it was intended, was prepared on the basis of two
   Latin drafts of Ursinus and a German draft of Olevianus. The peculiar
   gifts of both, the didactic clearness and precision of the one, and the
   pathetic warmth and unction of the other, were blended in beautiful
   harmony, and produced a joint work which is far superior to all the
   separate productions of either. In the Catechism they surpassed
   themselves. They were in a measure inspired for it. At the same time,
   they made free and independent use of the Catechisms of Calvin, Lasky,
   and Bullinger. The Elector took the liveliest interest in the
   preparation, and even made some corrections.

   In December, 1562, Frederick submitted the work to a general synod of
   the chief ministers and teachers assembled at Heidelberg, for revision
   and approval. It was published early in 1563, in German, under the
   title 'Catechismus, Or Christian Instruction, as conducted in the
   Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.' [1006] It is
   preceded by a short Preface of the Elector, dated Tuesday, January 19,
   1563, in which he informs the superintendents, clergymen, and
   schoolmasters of the Palatinate that, with the counsel and co-operation
   of the theological faculty and leading ministers of the Church, he had
   caused to be made and set forth a summary instruction or Catechism of
   our Christian religion from the Word of God, to be used hereafter in
   churches and schools for the benefit of the rising generation.

   THE THIRD EDITION AND THE EIGHTIETH QUESTION.

   There appeared, in the year 1563, three official editions of the
   Catechism with an important variation in the eightieth question, which
   denounces the Romish mass as 'a denial of the one sacrifice of Christ,
   and as an accursed idolatry.' In the first edition this question was
   wanting altogether; the second edition has it in part; the third in
   full, as it now stands. [1007] This question was inserted by the
   express command of the Elector, perhaps by his own hand, as a
   Protestant counter-blast to the Romish anathemas of the Council of
   Trent, which closed its sessions Dec. 4, 1563. Hence the remark at the
   end of the second and third editions: 'What has been overlooked in the
   first print, as especially on folio 55 [which contains the eightieth
   question], has now been added by command of his electoral grace. 1563.'

   The same view of the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation and the
   sacrifice of the mass was generally entertained by the Reformers, and
   is set forth as strongly in the Articles of Smalcald and other
   symbolical books, both Lutheran and Reformed. It must be allowed to
   remain as a solemn protest against idolatry. But the wisdom of
   inserting controversial matter into a catechism for the instruction of
   the youth has been justly doubted. The eightieth question disturbs the
   peaceful harmony of the book, it rewards evil for evil, it countenances
   intolerance, which is un-Protestant and unevangelical. It provoked much
   unnecessary hostility, and led even, under the Romish rule of the
   Elector Charles Philip, in 1719, to the prohibition of the Catechism;
   but the loud remonstrance of England, Prussia, Holland, and other
   Protestant states forced the Elector to withdraw the tyrannical decree
   within a year, under certain conditions, to save appearances.

   TRANSLATIONS.

   The Heidelberg Catechism was translated into all the European and many
   Asiatic languages. It has the pentecostal gift of tongues in a rare
   degree. It is stated that, next to the Bible, the 'Imitation of
   Christ,' by Thomas à Kempis, and Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress,' no book
   has been more frequently translated, more widely circulated and used.
   Whole libraries of paraphrases, commentaries, sermons, attacks, and
   defenses were written about it. In many Reformed churches, especially
   in Holland (and also in the United States), it was and is to some
   extent even now obligatory or customary to explain the Catechism from
   the pulpit every Sunday afternoon. Hence the division of the questions
   into fifty-two Sundays, in imitation of the example set by Calvin's
   Catechism. [1008]

   A Latin translation, for the use of colleges, was made by order of the
   Elector, by Joshua Lagus and Lambert Ludolph Pithopoeus, and appeared
   soon after the German, since Olevianus sent a copy of each to
   Bullinger, in Zurich, as early as April, 1563. [1009] It is, however,
   much inferior to the German in force and unction. The Latin text was
   often edited separately as well as in the works of Ursinus, in
   connection with his commentary and other Latin commentaries, and in
   collections of Reformed symbols. [1010]

   There are three Dutch translations: the first appeared at Emden, 1563;
   the second, by Peter Dathenus, in connection with a Dutch version of
   the Psalter, in 1566, and very often separately. [1011]

   A Greek translation was prepared by a distinguished classical scholar,
   D. Frid. Sylburg, 1597. [1012]

   Besides these there are editions in modern Greek, in Hebrew, Arabic,
   etc. [1013]

   Three or four English translations were made from the Latin, and
   obtained a wide circulation in Scotland, England, and America. [1014] A
   more correct one from the German original was prepared for the
   tercentenary celebration of the Catechism, by a learned and able
   committee appointed by the German Reformed Synod in Pennsylvania, but
   has not yet come into public use. [1015]

   The merits of the Latin and English translations, and their relation to
   the German original, may be seen from the following specimens:

   Note.--All the English versions, except the last, follow the Latin in
   its departures from the German, as 'most faithful Lord' (fidelissimi
   Domini) for 'faithful' (getreuen), 'heavenly Father' (Patris coelestis)
   for 'Father in heaven' (Vater im Himmel). The dependence on the Latin
   may be seen also in the words 'most fully satisfying' (plenissime
   satisfaciens), 'delivered' (liberavit) for 'redeemed' (erlöset),
   'delivery' (liberatio) for 'redemption' (Erlösung) and in the omission
   of 'heartily' (von Herzen), for which, however, the common American
   version (which seems to have made use also of the Dutch version)
   substitutes 'sincerely.'

   CHARACTER AND AIM.

   The Heidelberg Catechism answers the double purpose of a guide for the
   religious instruction of the youth and a confession of faith for the
   Church.

   As a catechism it is an acknowledged masterpiece, with few to equal and
   none to surpass it. Its only defect is that its answers are mostly too
   long for the capacity and memory of children. It is intended for a
   riper age. Hence an abridgment was made as early as 1585, but no
   attempts to simplify and popularize it have been able to supersede it.

   As a standard of public doctrine the Heidelberg Catechism is the most
   catholic and popular of all the Reformed symbols. The German Reformed
   Church acknowledges no other. The Calvinistic system is herein set
   forth with wise moderation, and without its sharp, angular points. This
   may be a defect in logic, but it is an advantage in religion, which is
   broader and deeper than logic. Children and the mass of the people are
   unable to appreciate metaphysical distinctions and the transcendent
   mysteries of eternal decrees. The doctrine of election to holiness and
   salvation in Christ (or the positive and edifying part of the dogma of
   predestination) is indeed incidentally set forth as a source of
   humility, gratitude, and comfort (Ques. 1, 31, 53, 54), but nothing is
   said of a double predestination, or of an eternal decree of
   reprobation, or of a limited atonement (comp. Ques. 37). These
   difficult questions are left to private opinion and theological
   science. This reserve is the more remarkable since the authors (as well
   as all other Reformers, except Melanchthon in his later period) were
   strict predestinarians.

   PLAN AND ARRANGEMENT.

   The Heidelberg Catechism follows the order of the Epistle to the
   Romans, and is divided into three parts. The first two questions are
   introductory. The first part treats of the sin and misery of man (Ques.
   3-11; comp. Rom. i. 18-iii. 20); the second of the redemption by Christ
   (Ques. 12-85; comp. Rom. iii. 21-xi. 36); the third of the thankfulness
   of the redeemed, or the Christian life (Ques. 86-129; comp. Rom.
   xii.-xvi.). The second part is the largest, and contains an explanation
   of all the articles of the Apostles' Creed under the three heads of God
   the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The doctrine of the
   sacraments is rightly incorporated in this part, instead of being
   treated in separate sections, as in the Roman and Lutheran Catechisms.
   The third part gives an exposition of the Decalogue (as a rule of
   obedience, viewed in the light of redemption) and of the Lord's Prayer.

   This order corresponds to the development of religious life and to the
   three leading ideas of repentance, faith, and love. The conception of
   Christian life, as an expression of gratitude for redeeming grace, is
   truly evangelical. In older catechisms the five or six parts of a
   catechism--namely, the Creed, the Decalogue, the Lord's Prayer,
   Baptism, the Lord's Supper--are mechanically co-ordinated; here they
   are worked up into an organic system.

   The execution is admirable throughout. Several answers are acknowledged
   gems in the history of catechetical literature--e.g., the definition of
   faith (Ques. 21), on providence (Ques. 27 and 28), on the significance
   of the Christian name (Ques. 31 and 32), on the benefit of the
   ascension (Ques. 49), and on justification by faith (Ques. 60).

   THE SPIRIT OF THE CATECHISM.

   The genius of the Catechism is brought out at once in the first
   question, which contains the central idea, and strikes the key-note. It
   is unsurpassed for depth, comfort, and beauty, and, once committed to
   memory, can never be forgotten. It represents Christianity in its
   evangelical, practical, cheering aspect, not as a commanding law, not
   as an intellectual scheme, not as a system of outward observances, but
   as the best gift of God to man, as a source of peace and comfort in
   life and in death. What can be more comforting, what at the same time
   more honoring and stimulating to a holy life than the assurance of
   being owned wholly by Christ our blessed Lord and Saviour, who
   sacrificed his own spotless life for us on the cross? The first
   question and answer of the Heidelberg Catechism is the whole gospel in
   a nutshell; blessed is he who can repeat it from the heart and hold it
   fast to the end. [1020]

   It would be difficult to find a more evangelical definition of faith
   than in Ques. 21: 'Faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I
   hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in his Word; but also a
   hearty trust, which the Holy Spirit works in me by the gospel, that not
   only to others, but to me also, forgiveness of sins, everlasting
   righteousness, and salvation are freely given by God, merely of grace,
   only for the sake of Christ's merits.' How rich and consoling is the
   lesson derived from God's all-ruling Providence in Ques. 28! 'That we
   may be patient in adversity, thankful in prosperity, and for what is
   future have good confidence in our faithful God and Father, that no
   creature shall separate us from his love, since all creatures are so in
   his hand that without his will they can not so much as move.'

   The Catechism is a work of religious enthusiasm, based on solid
   theological learning, and directed by excellent judgment. It is
   baptized with the pentecostal fire of the great Reformation, yet
   remarkably free from the polemic zeal and intolerance which
   characterized that wonderfully excited period--by far the richest and
   deepest in Church history next to the age of Christ and his inspired
   apostles. It is the product of the heart as well as the head, full of
   faith and unction from above. It is fresh, lively, glowing, yet clear,
   sober, self-sustained. The ideas are Biblical and orthodox, and well
   fortified by apt Scripture proofs. [1021] The language is dignified,
   terse, nervous, popular, and often truly eloquent. It is the language
   of devotion as well as instruction. Altogether the Heidelberg Catechism
   is more than a book, it is an institution, and will live as long as the
   Reformed Church.

   COMPARISON WITH THE LUTHERN AND WESTMINSTER CATECHISMS.

   The Heidelberg Catechism stands mediating between Luther's Small
   Catechism, which appeared thirty-four years earlier (1529), and the
   Shorter Westminster Catechism, which was prepared eighty-four years
   later (1647).

   These are the three most popular and useful catechisms that
   Protestantism has produced, and have still the strongest hold upon the
   churches they represent. They have the twofold character of catechisms
   and symbolical books. They are alike evangelical in spirit and aim;
   they lead directly to Christ as the one and all-sufficient Saviour, and
   to the Word of God as the only infallible rule of the Christian's faith
   and life.

   Luther's Catechism is the most churchly of the three, and adheres to
   the Catholic tradition in its order and arrangement. It assigns a very
   prominent place to the Sacraments, treating them in separate chapters,
   co-ordinate with the Decalogue, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer; while
   the others incorporate them in the general exposition of the articles
   of faith. Luther teaches baptismal regeneration and the corporeal
   presence, and even retains private confession and absolution as a
   quasi-sacrament. Heidelberg and Westminster are free from all remnants
   of sacerdotalism and sacramentalism, and teach the Calvinistic theory
   of the sacraments, which rises, however, much higher than the
   Zwinglian.

   On the other hand, the Lutheran and the Heidelberg Catechisms differ
   from the Westminster in the following points: 1. They retain the
   Apostles' Creed as the basis of doctrinal exposition; while the
   Westminster Catechism puts it in an appendix, and substitutes a new
   logical scheme of doctrine for the old historical order of the Creed.
   2. They are subjective, and address the catechumen as a Church member,
   who answers from his real or prospective personal experience; while the
   Westminster Catechism is objective and impersonal, and states the
   answer in an abstract proposition. 3. They use the warm and direct
   language of life, the Westminster the scholastic language of dogma;
   hence the former two are less definite but more expansive and
   suggestive than the Presbyterian formulary, which, on the other hand,
   far surpasses them in brevity, terseness, and accuracy of definition.

   Upon the whole we prefer the catechetical style and method of the
   creative Reformation period, because it is more Biblical and fresh, to
   that of the seventeenth century--the age of scholastic
   orthodoxy--although we freely concede the relative progress and
   peculiar excellences of the Westminster standard. [1022]

   The Heidelberg Catechism differs from that of Luther--1. By its
   fullness and thoroughness, and hence it is better adapted to a maturer
   age; while that of Luther has the advantage of brevity and childlike
   simplicity, and adaptation to early youth. The one has one hundred and
   twenty-nine, the other only forty questions and answers, and of these
   only three are devoted to the exposition of the Apostles' Creed, while
   the Sacraments receive disproportionate attention. 2. The Heidelberg
   Catechism gives the words of the Decalogue in full, according to the
   twentieth chapter of Exodus, and follows the old Jewish and Greek
   division, which is adopted by the best commentators; while Luther
   presents merely an abridgment, [1023] and follows the Roman division by
   omitting the second commandment and splitting the tenth into two.
   [1024] 3. The former gives a summary of the law, through which comes
   the knowledge of sin, in the first part (Ques. 3 and 4), but explains
   the Decalogue in the third division, viewing it in its Christian aspect
   as a permanent rule of life; while Luther regards the law in its Jewish
   or pedagogic aspect, as a schoolmaster leading men to Christ, and hence
   he puts it as the first head before the Creed. Ursinus correctly says:
   'The Decalogue belongs to the first part so far as it is a mirror of
   our sin and misery, but also to the third part as being the rule of our
   new obedience and Christian life.' [1025] 4. In the rendering of the
   Creed, besides minor verbal differences, the Heidelberg Catechism
   retains 'the holy catholic Church,' with the addition of 'Christian'
   (eine heilige allgemeine christliche Kirche); while Luther's omits
   'catholic,' and substitutes for it 'Christian.' [1026] 5. In the Lord's
   Prayer the Heidelberg Catechism uses the modern form 'Our Father'
   (Unser Vater), while Luther in his Catechism (though not in his
   translation of Matt. vi. 9 and Luke xi. 2) adheres to the Latin and old
   German form of 'Father our' (Vater unser), a difference tenaciously
   maintained by German Lutherans. The former divides the Prayer into six
   petitions (with the Greek commentators), and renders ek ponerou 'from
   the evil one' (vom Bösen, i.e., from the devil); while Luther (with
   Augustine) numbers seven petitions, and translates (herein agreeing
   with the English version) 'from evil' (vom Uebel).

   The difference between the Heidelberg and Westminster Catechisms is
   chiefly one of nationality. Where the choice is between the two, the
   former will be used in preference by Germans, the other by Scotch and
   English Presbyterians. The Westminster Shorter Catechism has the
   advantage of greater condensation and precision. It is not impossible
   to make a better one than either by blending the excellences of both.
   They represent also two types of piety: the one is more emotional and
   hearty, the other more scholastic and intellectual. This appears at
   once in the first question. The Heidelberg Catechism asks: 'What is thy
   only comfort in life and in death?' The Westminster: 'What is the chief
   end of man?' The one goes at once into the heart of evangelical
   piety--the mystical union of the believer with Christ; the other goes
   back to the creation and the glory of God; but both teach the same God
   and Christ, and the same way of salvation, whereby God is glorified,
   and man is raised to everlasting felicity in his enjoyment.

   HISTORY OF THE CATECHISM.

   1. The Heidelberg Catechism was greeted with great joy, and was at once
   introduced into the churches and schools of the Lower Palatinate; while
   the Upper Palatinate, under the governorship of Louis (the eldest son
   of Frederick III.) remained strictly Lutheran.

   But, like every good book, it had to pass through a trial of probation
   and a fire of martyrdom. Even before it was printed an anonymous writer
   attacked the Heidelberg Synod which, in December, 1562, had adopted the
   Catechism in manuscript, together with sundry measures of reform.
   [1027] After its publication it was violently assailed by strict
   Lutherans for its alleged Zwinglian and Calvinistic heresies, and by
   Jesuits on account of the condemnation of the idolatry of the mass in
   the eightieth question. The first opponents were Lutheran princes
   (Margrave Charles II. of Baden, Duke Christopher of Würtemberg, the
   Palatine of Zweibrücken), and Lutheran divines, such as Heshusius,
   Flacius, Brentius, and Andreæ. [1028] Ursinus wrote an able apology of
   his Catechism, which is embodied in several older editions since 1584.
   A theological colloquy was held at Maulbronn in April, 1564, where the
   theological leaders of the Lutheran Duchy of Würtemberg and the
   Reformed Palatinate, in the presence of their princes, debated for six
   days in vain on the eucharist and the ubiquity of Christ's body. Both
   parties were confirmed in their opinions, though the Reformed had the
   best of the argument. [1029]

   Frederick III., notwithstanding his appeal to Melanchthon and the
   Altered Augsburg Confession, was openly charged with apostasy from the
   Lutheran faith, and seriously threatened with exclusion from the peace
   of the empire. Even the liberal Emperor Maximilian II. wrote him a
   letter of remonstrance. His fate was to be decided at the Diet of
   Augsburg, 1566. At this critical juncture the pious Elector boldly
   defended his Catechism, which, he said, was all taken from the Bible,
   and so well fortified with marginal proof-texts that it could not be
   overthrown. He declared himself willing to yield to God's truth, if any
   one could show him any thing better from the Scripture, which was at
   hand for the purpose. Altogether he made, at the risk of his crown and
   his life, such a noble and heroic confession as reminds us of Luther's
   stand at the Diet of Worms. Even his Lutheran opponents were filled
   with admiration and praise, and left him thereafter in quiet possession
   of his faith. 'Why do ye persecute this man?' said the Margrave of
   Baden; 'he has more piety than the whole of us.' The Elector Augustus
   of Saxony gave similar testimony on this memorable occasion. [1030]

   Thus the Catechism had gained a sort of legal existence in the German
   empire, although it was not till after the Thirty-Years' War, in the
   Treaty of Westphalia, that the Reformed Church, as distinct from the
   Lutheran, was formally recognized in Germany.

   After the death of Frederick it had to pass through another persecution
   in the home of its birth. His successor, Louis VI. (1576-1583), exiled
   its authors, and replaced it by Luther's Catechism and the Formula of
   Concord. But under the regency of Frederick's second son, Prince John
   Casimir, the Heidelberg Catechism and the Reformed Church were restored
   to their former honor, and continued to flourish till the outbreak of
   the Thirty-Years' War.

   This war brought terrible devastation and untold misery upon Heidelberg
   and the Palatinate, which were laid waste by the merciless Tilly
   (1622). Then followed the repeated invasions of Turenne, Melac, and
   Marshal de Lorges, under Louis XIV. The Palatinate fell even into the
   hands of Roman Catholic rulers (1685), and never again rose to its
   former glory. Thousands of Protestants emigrated to America, and
   planted the Catechism in Pennsylvania, so that what it lost in the old
   world it gained in the new. The indifferentism and rationalism of the
   eighteenth century allowed all creeds to go into disuse and neglect. In
   the nineteenth century faith revived, and with it respect for the
   Heidelberg Catechism; but, owing to the introduction of the union of
   the Lutheran and Reformed Churches in the Grand Duchy of Baden, to
   which Heidelberg now belongs, it was merged into a new catechism
   compiled from it and from that of Luther. [1031]

   2. The history of the Palatinate Catechism extends far beyond the land
   of its birth. It took deeper root and acquired greater influence in
   other countries. Soon after its appearance it commended itself by its
   intrinsic excellences to all Reformed Churches of the German tongue. It
   was introduced in East Friesland, Jülich (Juliers), Cleve (Cleves),
   Berg, the Wupperthal, Bremen, Hesse Cassel, Anhalt, Brandenburg, East
   and West Prussia, the free imperial cities, in Hungary, Poland, and in
   several cantons of Switzerland, as St. Gall, Schaffhausen, and Berne.
   [1032] In the royal house of Prussia it is still used in the
   instruction of the princes, even after the introduction of the union of
   the two confessions. [1033]

   It was surrounded with a large number of learned works which fill an
   important place in the history of Reformed theology. Eminent professors
   made it the basis of lectures in the University.

   In no country was the Catechism more honored than in Holland and her
   distant colonies in Asia and Africa. It soon replaced the catechisms of
   Calvin and Lasky. The synods of Wesel, 1568, of Emden, 1571, and of
   Dort, 1574, recommended and enjoined its use; and ministers were
   required to explain it to the people in fifty-two lessons throughout
   the year in the afternoon service of the Lord's day. In the beginning
   of the sixteenth century the Arminians called for a revision of it, to
   remove certain features to which they objected. But the famous General
   Synod of Dort, after a careful examination, opposed any change, and, in
   its 148th Session, May 1, 1619, it unanimously delivered the judgment
   that the Heidelberg Catechism 'formed altogether a most accurate
   compend of the orthodox Christian faith; being, with singular skill,
   not only adapted to the understanding of the young, but suited also for
   the advantageous instruction of older persons; so that it could
   continue to be taught with great edification in the Belgic churches,
   and ought by all means to be retained.' This judgment was agreed to by
   all the foreign delegates from Germany, Switzerland, and England, and
   has thus an oecumenical significance for the Reformed communion.

   The Heidelberg Catechism was also clothed with symbolical authority in
   Scotland, and was repeatedly printed 'by public authority,' even after
   the Westminster standards had come into use. It seems to have there
   practically superseded Calvin's Catechism, but it was in turn
   superseded by Craig's Catechism, and Craig's by that of the Westminster
   Assembly.

   3. From Holland the Heidelberg Catechism crossed the Atlantic to
   Manhattan Island (1609), with the discoverer of the Hudson River, and
   was the first Protestant catechism planted on American soil. A hundred
   years later, German emigrants, driven from the Palatinate by Romish
   persecution and tyranny, carried it to Pennsylvania and other colonies.
   It has remained ever since the honored symbol of the Dutch and German
   Reformed Churches in America, and will continue to be used as long as
   they retain their separate denominational existence, or even if they
   should unite with the larger Presbyterian body.

   One of the first acts of the reunited Presbyterian Church in the United
   States, at the session of the General Assembly in Philadelphia, May,
   1870, was the formal sanction of the use of the Heidelberg Catechism in
   any congregation which may desire it. [1034]

   4. In the year 1863, three centuries after its first publication, the
   Heidelberg Catechism witnessed its greatest triumph, not only in
   Germany and Holland, but still more in a land which the authors never
   saw, and in a language the sound of which they probably never heard.
   The Reformation was similarly honored in 1817, and the Augsburg
   Confession in 1830, but no other catechism.

   In Germany the tercentenary celebration of the Heidelberg Catechism was
   left to individual pastors and congregations, and called forth some
   valuable publications. [1035]

   The German Reformed Church in the United States took it up as a body,
   and gave it a wider scope. She made the three-hundredth anniversary of
   her confession the occasion for a general revival of theological and
   religious life, the publication of a triglot edition of the Catechism,
   the endowment of a tercentenary professorship in her seminary, and the
   collection of large sums of money for churches, missions, and other
   benevolent objects. All these ends were accomplished. The celebration
   culminated in a general convention of ministers and laymen in
   Philadelphia, which lasted a whole week, January 17-23, 1863, in the
   midst of the raging storm of the civil war. About twenty interesting
   and instructive essays on the Catechism and connected topics, which had
   been specially prepared for the occasion by eminent German, Dutch, and
   American divines, were read in two churches before crowded and
   attentive assemblies. Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Frederick
   III., Ursinus, and Olevianus were called from their graves to reproduce
   before an American audience the ideas, trials, and triumphs of the
   creative and heroic age of the Reformation. Altogether the year 1863
   marks an epoch in the history of the Heidelberg Catechism and of the
   German Reformed Church in America. [1036]

   OPINIONS ON THE CATECHISM.

   We close this chapter with a selection from the many warm commendations
   which the Heidelberg Catechism has received from distinguished divines
   of different countries.

   Henry Bullinger, the friend and successor of Zwingli, himself the
   author of a catechism (1559) and of the Second Helvetic Confession
   (1566), wrote to a friend:

   'The order of the book is clear; the matter true, good, and beautiful;
   the whole is luminous, fruitful, and godly; it comprehends many and
   great truths in a small compass. I believe that no better catechism has
   ever been issued.' [1037]

   The Hessian divines quoted by David Pareus:

   'There is no catechism more thorough, more perfect, and better adapted
   to the capacity of adults as well as the young.'

   The English delegates to the Synod of Dort, George Carleton (Bishop of
   Llandaff), John Davenant (afterwards Bishop of Salisbury), Archdeacon
   Samuel Ward, Dr. Thomas Goade, and Walter Balcanqual, said:

   'That neither their own nor the French Church had a catechism so
   suitable and excellent; that those who had compiled it were therein
   remarkably endowed and assisted by the Spirit of God; that in several
   of their works they had excelled other theologians, but that in the
   composition of this Catechism they had outdone themselves.' [1038]

   The favorable judgment of the Synod of Dort itself has already been
   quoted.

   Dr. Ullmann (d. 1865), formerly Professor at Heidelberg, and one of the
   best Church historians of the nineteenth century: [1039]

   'The Heidelberg Catechism, more systematically executed than Luther's,
   unfolds upon the fundamental thoughts of sin, redemption, and
   thankfulness, the Reformed doctrine, yet without touching upon
   predestination, with rare pithiness and clearness, and obtained through
   these excellences not only speedy and most extended recognition in the
   Reformed Churches, but is to-day still regarded by all parties as one
   of the most masterly productions in this department.'

   Dr. Aug. Ebrard, one of the ablest and most prolific German Reformed
   divines: [1040]

   'For wonderful union of dogmatic precision and genial heartiness,
   [1041] of lucid perspicuity and mysterious depth, the Heidelberg
   Catechism stands alone in its kind. It is at once a system of theology
   and a book of devotion; every child can understand it at the first
   reading, and yet the catechist finds in it the richest material for
   profound investigation.'

   Max Göbel, the author of an excellent history of Christian life in the
   Reformed Church: [1042]

   'The Heidelberg Catechism may be properly regarded as the flower and
   fruit of the entire German and French Reformation; it has Lutheran
   fervor, Melanchthonian clearness, Zwinglian simplicity, and Calvinistic
   fire blended in one, and therefore--notwithstanding many defects and
   angles--it has been (together with the Altered Augsburg Confession of
   1540), and remains to this day, the only common confession and
   doctrinal standard of the entire German Reformed Church from the
   Palatinate to the Netherlands, and to Brandenburg and Prussia.'

   Karl Sudhoff, formerly a Roman Catholic priest, then pastor of the
   German Reformed Church at Frankfort-on-the-Main: [1043]

   'A peculiar power and unction pervades the whole work, which can not
   easily be mistaken by any one. The book, therefore, speaks with
   peculiar freshness and animation directly to the soul, because it
   appears as a confident, joyous confession of the Christian heart
   assured of salvation. It is addressed to the heart and will as much as
   to the head. Keen and popular unfolding of ideas is here most
   beautifully united with the deep feeling of piety, as well as with the
   earnest spirit of revival and joyous believing confidence. And who that
   have read this Catechism but once can mistake how indissolubly united
   with these great excellences is the powerful, dignified, and yet so
   simple style! What a true-hearted, intelligible, simple, and yet lofty
   eloquence speaks to us even from the smallest questions!'

   Dr. K. B. Hundeshagen, Professor of Theology at Heidelberg, afterwards
   in Bonn (d. 1873), calls the Heidelberg Catechism a 'witness of
   Reformed loyalty to the Word of God, of Reformed purity and firmness of
   faith, of Reformed moderation and sobriety,' and a work 'of eternal
   youth and never-ceasing value.' [1044]

   Dr. Plitt, formerly Pastor in Heidelberg, then Professor of Theology in
   Bonn: [1045]

   'The Heidelberg Catechism still lives; it has not died in three hundred
   years. It lives in the hearts of Christians. How many catechisms have
   since then disappeared, how many in the last thirty or forty years, and
   have been so long sunk in the "sea of oblivion," that one scarcely
   knows their titles. The Heidelberg Catechism has survived its
   tercentenary jubilee, and will, God willing, see several such jubilees.
   It will not die; it will live as long as there is an Evangelical
   Church.'

   Dr. Henry Harbaugh, late Professor of Theology at Mercersburg (d.
   1867), a gifted poet and the author of several popular religious works:
   [1046]

   'It is worthy of profound consideration, that the Heidelberg Catechism,
   which has always ruled the heart, spirit, and body of the Reformed side
   of the Reformation, has no prototype in any of the Reformers. Zwingli
   and Calvin can say, It is not of me; it has the suavity but not the
   compromising spirit of Melanchthon. It has nothing of the dashing
   terror of Luther. What is stranger than all, it is farthest possible
   removed from the mechanical scholasticism and rigid logic of Ursinus,
   its principal author. Though it has the warm, practical, sacred,
   poetical fervor of Olevianus, it has none of his fire and flame. It is
   greater than Reformers; it is purer and sounder than theologians.'

   Dr. J. W. Nevin, successively Professor of Theology in the Presbyterian
   Seminary at Alleghany, in the German Reformed Seminary at Mercersburg,
   and President of Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa.: [1047]

   'In every view, we may say, the Catechism of the Palatinate, now three
   hundred years old, is a book entitled, in no common degree, to
   admiration and praise. It comes before us as the ripe product of the
   proper confessional life of the Reformed Church, in the full bloom of
   its historical development, as this was reached at the time when the
   work made its appearance. Its wide-spread and long-continued popularity
   proclaims its universal significance and worth. It must have been
   admirably adapted to the wants of the Church at large, as well as
   admirably true to the inmost sense of its general life, to come in this
   way into such vast credit. Among all Protestant symbols, whether of
   earlier or later date, there is no other in which we find the like
   union of excellent qualities combined and wrought together in the same
   happy manner. It is at once a creed, a catechism, and a confession; and
   all this in such a manner, at the same time, as to be often a very
   liturgy also, instinct with the full spirit of worship and devotion. It
   is both simple and profound; a fit manual of instruction for the young,
   and yet a whole system of divinity for the old; a text-book, suited
   alike for the use of the pulpit and the family, the theological
   seminary, and the common school. It is pervaded by a scientific spirit,
   beyond what is common in formularies of this sort; but its science is
   always earnestly and solemnly practical. In its whole constitution, as
   we have seen, it is more a great deal than doctrine merely, or a form
   of sound words for the understanding. It is doctrine apprehended and
   represented continually in the form of life. It is for the heart every
   where full as much as for the head. Among its characteristic
   perfections deserves to be noted always, with particular praise, its
   catholic spirit, and the rich mystical element that pervades so largely
   its whole composition. . . . Simple, beautiful, and clear in its
   logical construction, the symbol moves throughout also in the element
   of fresh religious feeling. It is full of sensibility and faith and
   joyous childlike trust. Its utterances rise at times to a sort of
   heavenly pathos, and breathe forth almost lyrical strains of devotion.'

   Dr. Hagenbach, the well-known historian (d. at Basle, 1874): [1048]

   'The Heidelberg Catechism was greeted not only in the Palatinate but in
   all Reformed churches as the correct expression of the Reformed faith,
   and attained the authority of a genuine symbolical standard. It was
   translated into nearly all languages, and has continued to be the basis
   of religious instruction to this day. . . . Its tone, notwithstanding
   the scholastic and dogmatizing or (as Ullmann says) constructive
   tendency, is truly popular and childlike.'

   Then he quotes several questions as models of the catechetical style.

   Dr. Dalton, of St. Petersburg: [1049]

   'The Heidelberg Catechism exhibits the harmonious union of the
   Calvinistic and the Melanchthonian spirit. It is the ripe fruit of the
   whole Reformation and the true heir of the treasures gathered, not in
   ten years, but during that entire period. It is thoroughly Biblical,
   and represents its particular denominational type with great wisdom and
   moderation. We feel from beginning to end in the clear and expressive
   word the warm and sound pulse of a heart that was baptized by the fire
   and Spirit from above, and knows what it believes.'

   It is gratifying that the Lutheran hostility of former days has given
   way to a sincere appreciation. Drs. Guericke and Kurtz, two prominent
   champions of Lutheran orthodoxy in the nineteenth century, in almost
   the same words praise the Heidelberg Catechism for 'its signal wisdom
   in teaching, its Christian fervor, theological ability, and mediating
   moderation.' [1050] Dr. Julius Stahl, an eminent jurist and the ablest
   apologist of modern Lutheranism within the Prussian Union, derived the
   religious revival of the Lutheran Church in his native Bavaria and his
   own conversion chiefly from the late venerable Reformed pastor and
   professor, Dr. J. Chr. G. L. Krafft, in Erlangen (died 1845). 'The
   man,' he said, before the General Synod at Berlin, 1846, 'who built up
   the Church in my fatherland, the most apostolic man I ever met in my
   life, Pastor Krafft, was a strict adherent of the Reformed creed.
   Whether he carried the Heidelberg Catechism in his pocket I know not,
   but this I know, that he caused throughout the whole land a spring to
   bloom whose fruits will ripen for eternity.' [1051]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1004] Responsio Ph. Mel. ad quæstionem de controversia Heidelbergensi
   (Nov. 1, 1559), in Corp. Reform. Vol. IX. pp. 960 sqq. It is the last
   public utterance of Melanchthon on the eucharistic question, and agrees
   substantially with the doctrine of Calvin, as it was afterwards
   expressed in the Heidelberg Catechism.

   [1005] On the door of his study he inscribed the warning, 'Amice,
   quisquis huc venis, aut agita paucis, aut abi, aut me laborantem
   adjuva.'

   [1006] See the original title in the literature above.

   [1007] By the discovery of the copy of the first ed., 1864, the origin
   of the eightieth question was satisfactorily decided. A second copy of
   the original ed. is in the Imperial Library of Vienna. The Brit. Museum
   contains a copy of the Engl. trans. by "William Turner, Doctor of
   Physick, Imprinted at London, by Richard Jones, 1572."--Ed.

   [1008] This division was first introduced in the Latin edition of 1566,
   perhaps earlier. Van Alpen, Niemeyer, and others are wrong in dating it
   from the German edition of 1573 or 1575.

   [1009] Doedes gives a fac-simile of the title-page of the Latin edition
   of 1563, from a copy in the University Library at Utrecht. It is nearly
   the same as the title of the edition of 1566, given in the literature
   above.

   [1010] Niemeyer (pp. 428 sqq.) reproduces the edition of 1584, which
   agrees with the ed. princeps of 1563 (as far as I can judge from the
   few fac-simile pages given by Doedes), and with the text in the Oxford
   Sylloge, while that in the Græco-Latin edition of Sylburg slightly
   differs. Dr. Louis H. Steiner, of Frederick City, Md., published an
   elegant and accurate edition under the title 'Catechesis Religionis
   Christianæ seu Catechismus Heidelbergensis. Baltimore, 1862.' He gives
   the variations of three Latin editions: of Cambridge, 1585; of Geneva,
   1609 (formerly in the possession of Chevalier Bunsen); and the Oxford
   Sylloge, 1804.

   [1011] On the Dutch translations, see especially the learned work of
   Professor Doedes, of Utrecht, pp. 74-128, with fac-similes at the end
   of the volume.

   [1012] I have before me a Græco-Latin edition of the Catechism
   katecheseis tes chrispanikes threskeias, by Sylburg, and of the Belgic
   Confession by Jac. Revius, printed at Utrecht, 1660. Earlier editions I
   see noticed in catalogues.

   [1013] Niemeyer (Proleg. p. lxii.) mentions a Polish translation by
   Prasmovius, a Hungarian by Scarasius, an Arabic by Chelius, a Singalese
   by Konyer, besides French, Italian, Spanish, English, Bohemian, modern
   Greek, and Hebrew versions. Doedes (p. 41) adds a Persian and a Malayan
   translation. There are no doubt many other versions.

   [1014] An English edition, without the name of the translator, appeared
   A.D. 1591 at Edinburgh, 'by publick Authority, for the Use of
   Scotland,' and also repeatedly in connection with the 'Psalm-Book and
   the Book of Common Order.' It is embodied in Dunlop's Collection of
   Confessions of Faith, etc., of publick authority in the Church of
   Scotland (Edinburgh, 1719-1722), Vol. II. pp. 273-361, and reproduced
   by Dr. Horatius Bonar in his Catechisms of the Scottish Reformation
   (London, 1866), pp. 112-170. Dr. Bonar says (p. 171): 'There are
   several translations of the Heidelberg or Palatine Catechism; and our
   Church [the Church of Scotland] seems not to have kept to one. In the
   edition of the Book of Common Order before us (1615), the Catechism is
   given alone; in that which Dunlop has followed, it has the "Arguments"
   and "Uses" of Bastingius.' Another translation by Bishop Henry Parry,
   of Worcester (d. 1616), appeared (together with the commentary of
   Ursinus) at Oxford, 1509 and 1601. It was often republished--at
   Edinburgh, 1615 (with sundry variations, see Bonar, p. 172), again in
   London, 1633, 1645, 1728, 1851, and quite recently (from the Oxford
   edition of 1601, with the variations of the edition of 1728) by Dr.
   Gerhart and Dr. Louis Steiner in the 'Mercersburg Review' for 1861, pp.
   74 sqq. The one now in use in the Dutch and German Reformed Churches in
   America, is traced (by the late Dr. De Witt of New York) to Dr.
   Laidlie, originally from Scotland, minister at Flushing, Long Island,
   and was adopted, 1771, by the Synod of the Reformed Dutch Church. These
   three English translations seem to be only different recensions of one
   translation compared with the Latin text.

   [1015] See the tercentenary triglot edition of 1863, noticed in the
   literature above.

   [1016] So also the Oxford Sylloge. The ed. Græco-Latina of Sylburg
   reads instead: plenissima solutione facta.

   [1017] Al. edd. illa.

   [1018] Al. Alterum.

   [1019] The redundant 'wholly' occurs also in the Edinburgh edition of
   1615, which, to judge from the specimens given by Horatius Bonar (in
   Catechisms of the Scottish Reformation, p. 172), is a reprint of
   Parry's translation with a few variations.

   [1020] Dr. Nevan {Tercentenary Edition, Introd. p. 95) says: 'No
   question in the whole Catechism has been more admired than this, and
   none surely is more worthy of admiration. Where shall we find, in the
   same compass, a more beautifully graphic, or a more impressively full
   and pregnant representation of all that is comprehended for us in the
   grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ? For thousands and tens of
   thousands, during the past three hundred years, it has been as a whole
   system of theology in the best sense of the term, their pole-star over
   the sea of life, and the sheet-anchor of their hope amid the waves of
   death. But what we quote it for now is simply to show the mind that
   actuates and rules the Catechism throughout. We have here at once its
   fundamental conception and the reigning law of its construction; the
   key-note, we may say, which governs its universal sense, and whose
   grandly solemn tones continue to make themselves heard through all its
   utterances from beginning to end.'

   [1021] Ques. 44 is hardly an exception; for the idea therein expressed
   is no error per se, but only a false interpretation of the article on
   Christ's descent into hell (Hades) in the Apostles' Creed, which places
   it, as an actual fact, between death and the resurrection, in
   accordance with the Scriptures (Luke xxiii. 43; Acts ii. 27, 31; 1 Pet.
   iii. 19; iv. 6; Eph. iv. 9, 10); while the Catechism, following Calvin
   and Lasky, understands it figuratively of Christ's suffering on the
   cross.

   [1022] 'It may be questioned,' says Dr. Bonar, of the Free Church of
   Scotland, 'whether the Church gained any thing by the exchange of the
   Reformation standards for those of the seventeenth century. The
   scholastic mold in which the latter are cast has somewhat trenched upon
   the ease and breadth which mark the former; and the skillful
   metaphysics employed at Westminster in giving lawyer-like precision to
   each statement have imparted a local and temporary aspect to the new
   which did not belong to the more ancient standards. Or, enlarging the
   remark, we may say that there is something about the theology of the
   Reformation which renders it less likely to become obsolete than the
   theology of the covenant. The simpler formulas of the older age are
   quite as explicit as those of the later; while by the adoption of the
   Biblical in preference to the scholastic mode of expression they have
   secured for themselves a buoyancy which will bear them up when the
   others go down. The old age of that generation is likely to be greener
   than that of their posterity.' (Catechisms of the Scottish Reformation,
   Preface, p. viii.)

   [1023] For example, the fourth (third) commandment is thus condensed:
   'Du sollst den Feiertag heiligen' (Thou shalt keep holy the rest-day).

   [1024] Comp. p. 251, note 2.

   [1025] The Germans express the different aspects of the law by calling
   it a Sündenspiegel, Sündenriegel, and Lebensregel, a mirror of sin, a
   bar of sin, and a rule of life.

   [1026] Hence in Germany the term 'Catholic' and 'Romanist' are used
   synonymously, and the proverb 'Das ist um katholisch zu werden'
   expresses a desperate condition of things. The English Churches have
   properly retained the term 'catholic' in its good old sense, instead of
   allowing Romanists to monopolize it.

   [1027] This curious document, which throws light upon that Synod
   hitherto little known, has been recently recovered and published by
   Wolters in the Studien mud Kritiken for 1867, No. 1, pp. 15 sqq. The
   Lutheran author, perhaps a dissenting member of the Synod, gives a list
   of the measures for the introduction of the Catechism and the abolition
   of various abuses, and accompanies them with bitter marginal comments,

   Anabaptist heresy;' 'To spread Zwinglianism;' 'Friss Vogel oder stirb;'

   abrogatio;' 'Hispanica inquisitio.'

   [1030] Hundeshagen says of Frederick III.: 'He is acknowledged to be
   the greatest ruler which the evangelical Palatinate ever had, and as to
   personal piety and loyalty to his faith the shining model of an
   evangelical prince.' See his art. on the City and University of

   1851, republished in his Schriften und Abhandlungen, ed. by Dr.
   Christlieb, Gotha, 1875, Vol. II. pp. 119 sqq.

   [1032] The editions used in the Canton Berne have an
   anti-supralapsarian addition to Question 27: 'Und obwohl die Sünden
   durch Gottes Fürsehung werden regiert, so ist doch Gott keine Ursache
   der Sünde; denn das Ziel unterscheidet die Werke. Siehe Exempel an
   Joseph und seinen Brüdern, an David und Simei, an Christo und den
   Juden.' This addition is found as early as 1697. Noticed by Trechsel in
   Studien und Kritiken for 1867, p. 574.

   [1033] So I was informed by the late court chaplain, Dr. Snethlage, of
   Berlin, who was originally Reformed, and who confirmed several members
   of the royal family.

   [1034] A special committee, appointed by the Old School Assembly of
   1869, reported to the first reunited Assembly of 1870, after a
   laudatory description of the Heidelberg Catechism, the following
   resolutions, which were unanimously adopted: 1. Resolved, That this
   General Assembly recognizes in the Heidelberg Catechism a valuable
   Scriptural compendium of Christian doctrine and duty. 2. Resolved, That
   if any churches desire to employ the Heidelberg Catechism in the
   instruction of their children, they may do so with the approbation of
   this Assembly. See the Minutes of the General Assembly of the
   Presbyterian Church in the United States of America for 1870, p. 120,

   by Ullmann, Sack, Plitt, Hundeshagen, Wolters, and Trechsel, in the

   Brandenburg, the central province of Prussia, with Berlin as its
   capital, ruled since 1415 by princes of the house of Hohenzollern, at
   first embraced the Lutheran Reformation, but at the beginning of the
   seventeenth century the Elector became Calvinistic, drawing with him a
   few influential ministers and congregations. This Reformed diaspora
   received an accession of about twenty thousand exiled Huguenots under
   the liberal policy of the great Elector Frederick William (1620-1688),
   the proper founder of the Prussian monarchy, who secured the legal
   recognition of the Reformed Church in the Treaty of Westphalia (1648).

   There are three Reformed Confessions of Brandenburg--namely, the
   Confession of the Elector Sigismund (1614), the Leipzig Colloquy
   (1631), and the Declaration of Thorn (1645). They bear a moderately
   Calvinistic, we may say a Unionistic, type, and had a certain
   symbolical authority in Brandenburg till the introduction of the union
   of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches in 1817. The great Elector
   mentions them together in 1664. The Canons of Dort were respectfully
   received but never adopted by the Brandenburg divines.

   THE CONFESSION OF SIGISMUND. A.D. 1614.

   See the original German text in the collections of Beck, Niemeyer,
   Böckel, and also in Heppe's Bekenntniss-Schriften der reform. Kirchen
   Deutschlands, pp. 284-294.

   John Sigismund (or Siegmund), Elector of Brandenburg (b. 1572, d. 1619)
   and ancestor of the royal line of Prussia, was brought up in the
   rigorous orthodoxy of the Lutheran Formula of Concord, and in his
   twenty-first year a solemn pledge was exacted from him by his father
   that he would always adhere to this creed (1593). But religious
   compulsion had on him an effect directly contrary to that contemplated
   (as is often the case with independent minds). His social relations
   with Holland, Cleves, and the Palatinate gave him a favorable
   impression of the doctrines and discipline of the Calvinistic Churches.
   In 1608 he succeeded to the throne. At Christmas, 1613, he publicly
   professed the Reformed faith by receiving the holy communion, according
   to the Reformed rite, in the Dome of Berlin, together with fifty-four
   others, including his brother John George, the Count of Nassau, Ernst
   Casimir, and the English embassador.

   This act was the result of conscientious conviction. [1052] It was
   meant to be not so much a change of creed as a further progress in
   Protestantism, but it created a great sensation, and called forth
   violent protests from Lutheran princes and pulpits. [1053] An edict
   forbidding public denunciations had little effect. A fanatical mob
   arose in rebellion against the Reformed preachers, and plundered their
   houses (1615). The great majority of the Elector's subjects and his own
   wife remained Lutherans. [1054]

   Nevertheless, his transition was of great prospective importance, for
   the house of Brandenburg was destined to become, by extraordinary
   talents and achievements, one of the leading dynasties of Europe, and
   to take the helm of the new Protestant German empire.

   In May, 1614, Sigismund issued a personal confession of faith, which is
   called after him and also after his country. It was drawn up by
   himself, with the aid of Dr. Pelargus, General Superintendent at
   Frankfort-on-the-Oder. It is brief, moderate, conciliatory, and
   intended to be merely supplementary concerning the controverted
   articles. The Elector professes faith in the 'true, infallible, and
   saving Word of God, as the only rule of the pious which is perfect,
   sufficient for salvation, and abides forever.' Then he accepts, as
   agreeing with the Bible, the oecumenical creeds (namely, the Apostles',
   the Nicene, the Athanasian, also the doctrinal decisions of Ephesus,
   431, and of Chalcedon, 451), and the Augsburg Confession of 1530, with
   the later improvements of Melanchthon.

   In regard to the controverted articles, Sigismund rejects the Lutheran
   doctrine of the ubiquity of Christ's body, and exorcism in baptism as a
   superstitious ceremony, and the use of the wafer instead of the
   breaking of bread in the communion. He adopts the Reformed doctrine of
   the sacraments, and of an eternal and unconditional election of grace,
   yet with the declaration that God sincerely wished the salvation of all
   men, and was not the author of sin and damnation.

   In conclusion the Elector expresses his wish and prayer that God may
   enlighten his faithful subjects with his truth, but disclaims all
   intention to coerce their conscience, since faith was the free gift of
   God (John vi. 29; 2 Thess. iii. 2; Phil. i. 29; Eph. iii. 8), and no
   one should presume to exercise dominion over men's religion (2 Cor. i.
   24). He thus freely waived, in relation to his Lutheran subjects, the
   right of reformation, which was claimed and exercised by other
   Protestant princes, and established a basis for religious liberty and
   union.

   This wise toleration was in advance of the age, and contrasts favorably
   with the opposite policy of the Elector Augustus of Saxony, who forced
   the Formula of Concord upon his people, and answered the Emperor
   Maximilian II., when he interceded for the release from prison of
   Peucer (Melanchthon's son-in-law): 'I want only such servants as
   believe and confess in religion neither more nor less than I myself
   believe and confess.' [1055] These times of terrorism over men's
   consciences are happily passed, and Sigismund's toleration has become
   the settled policy of his successors to this day.

   The conduct of Luther and Zwingli at Marburg gave tone and character to
   all subsequent union conferences of the two confessions they represent.
   The Reformed, with a larger charity, were always willing to commune
   with Lutherans notwithstanding minor doctrinal differences; while the
   Lutherans, with a narrower conscience and a more compact system of
   theology, refused the hand of fellowship to the Reformed, and abhorred
   as a syncretistic heresy all union that was not based upon perfect
   agreement in dogma; yea, during the seventeenth century they would
   rather make common cause with Romanists than Calvinists, and went so
   far as to exclude the Calvinists from heaven. [1056] Fortunately
   Calixtus and his school, who had the Melanchthonian spirit, formed an
   honorable exception, and the exception, after much misrepresentation
   and persecution, has become the rule in the Lutheran Church.

   THE COLLOQUY AT LEIPZIG. A.D. 1631.

   See the German text of the Colloquium Lipsiense in Niemeyer, pp.
   653-668, and in Böckel, pp. 443-456.

   In the midst of the fierce polemics between the Churches and the
   horrors of the Thirty-Years' War growing out of it, there arose from
   time to time a desire for union and peace, which was strengthened by
   the common danger. In 1629, Ferdinand II., a pupil of the Jesuits,
   issued an edict aiming at the destruction of Protestantism, which might
   have been accomplished had not Gustavus Adolphus soon afterwards
   appeared on German soil. It was during this period that the classical
   union sentence (often erroneously attributed to Augustine), 'In
   necessary things unity, in doubtful things liberty, in all things
   charity,' was first uttered as a prophetic voice in the wilderness by a
   Lutheran divine of the school of Calixtus, and re-echoed in England by
   Richard Baxter. [1057]

   Under the operation of this feeling and the threatening pressure of
   Romanism, the Elector Christian William of Brandenburg, accompanied by
   his chaplain, John Bergius, and the Landgrave William of Hesse, with
   the theological Professor Crocius and Chaplain Theophilus Neuberger,
   met at Leipzig with the Elector George of Saxony and the Lutheran
   divines Matthias Hoë of Hoënegg, Polycarp Leyser, and Henry Höpfner, to
   confer in a private way about a friendly understanding between the two
   confessions, hoping to set a good example to other divines of Germany.
   The conference lasted from March 3 to 23, 1631, and each session
   continued three hours.

   The Augsburg Confession of 1530, with Melanchthon's subsequent
   explanations, was made the basis of the proceedings, and was discussed
   article by article. They agreed essentially on all the doctrines except
   the omnipresence of Christ's human nature, the oral manducation of his
   body in the eucharist by worthy and unworthy communicants. The Reformed
   divines were willing, notwithstanding these differences, to treat the
   Lutherans as brethren, and to make common cause with them against the
   Papists. But the Lutherans were not prepared to do more than to take
   this proposal into serious consideration.

   The question of election was then also taken up, although it is not
   expressly mentioned in the Augsburg Confession. They agreed that only a
   portion of the race was actually saved. The Reformed traced election to
   the absolute will of God, and reprobation to the unbelief of men; the
   Lutherans (adhering to the happy inconsistency of the Formula of
   Concord) brought in God's foreknowledge of the faith of the elect, but
   they derived faith itself entirely from God's free electing grace. The
   difference was therefore very immaterial, and simply a matter of logic.

   In conclusion, the theologians declared that the conference was
   intended not to compromise the Churches and sovereigns, but only to
   find out whether and to what extent both parties agreed in the
   Twenty-eight Articles of the Augsburg Confession, and whether there was
   reason to hope for some nearer approach in the future, whereby the true
   Church might be strengthened against the Papists. In the mean time the
   proceedings of the conference were to be regarded as strictly private,
   and not to be published by either party without the consent of the
   other. The theologians of the two Churches were to show each other
   Christian love, praying that 'the God of truth and peace grant that we
   may be one in him, as he is one with the Son (John xvii. 21). Amen,
   Amen in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.'

   The document is not signed by the princes who arranged the conference,
   but only by the theologians -- namely, Drs. von Hoënegg, Leyser,
   Höpfner (Lutherans), and Bergius, Crocius, Neuberger (Reformed). [1058]

   The proceedings were characterized by great theological ability and an
   excellent Christian temper, and showed a much closer harmony than was
   expected. They excited considerable sympathy among the Reformed at home
   and abroad. But the Lutheran members were severely taken to task for
   favoring syncretism, and in vindicating themselves they became more
   uncompromising against Calvinism than before. The conference was in
   advance of the spirit of the age, and left no permanent effect.

   THE COLLOQUY OF THORN. A.D. 1645.

   The official edition of the Acts: Acta Conventus Thoruniensis celebrati
   a. 1645, etc., Warsaw, 1646 (very incorrect). The Acts, with the two
   Protestant Confessions (which were excluded from the official Acts), in
   Calovius, Historia Syncretistica (1682), 1685, pp. 199-560. The
   Reformed Declaratio Thoruniensis, Latin, in Niemeyer (pp. 669-689);
   German, in Böckel (pp. 865-884).

   The Colloquy of Thorn, in West Prussia (Colloquium Thoruniense), was
   likewise a well-meant but fruitless union conference in a time of
   sectarian intolerance and the suicidal folly of the Thirty-Years' War.

   In this case the movement proceeded from the Roman Catholic king,
   Wladislaus IV., of Poland (1632-1648). In this country moderate
   Lutherans, Calvinists, and Moravians had formed a conservative union in
   the Consensus of Sendomir (1570), and a treaty of peace secured equal
   civil rights to Protestants and Romanists (Pax Dissidentium in 1573).
   But this peace was denounced by the Pope as a league of Christ with
   Belial, and undermined by the Jesuits, who obtained the control of the
   education of the Polish nobility, and are to a large extent responsible
   for the ultimate dismemberment and ruin of that unfortunate kingdom.

   Wladislaus made a patriotic effort to heal the religious discords of
   his subjects, and invited Romanists and Dissenters (Protestants) to a
   charitable colloquy (colloquium caritativum, fraterna collatio) in the
   city of Thorn, which was then under the protection of the King of
   Poland (since 1454), and had embraced the Lutheran faith (1557). It
   began April 18, 1645, in the town-hall. There were three parties. The
   twenty-eight Roman deputies, including eight Jesuits, were determined
   to defeat the object of peace, and to prevent any concessions to
   Protestants. The Reformed had twenty-four delegates, chief among them
   the electoral chaplains John Bergius and Fr. Reichel, of Brandenburg,
   and the Moravian bishop Amos Comenius. The Lutheran deputation
   consisted of fifteen, afterwards of twenty-eight members; the most
   prominent were Calovius of Dantzic and Hülsemann of Wittenberg, the
   champions of the strictest orthodoxy, and George Calixtus of Helmstädt,
   the leader of a mild and comprehensive union theology. [1059] The
   sessions were private ('plebs penitus arcenda'). The king's chancellor,
   Prince George Ossolinski, presided.

   The first business, called 'liquidatio,' was to be the preparation of a
   correct statement of the doctrinal system of each party. The Roman
   Catholic Confession, with a list of rejected misrepresentations, was
   ready early in September, and read in the second public session, Sept.
   16. It was received among the official acts. On the same day the
   Reformed Confession was read, under the title Declaratio doctrinæ,
   ecclesiarum Reformatarum catholicæ. But the Romanists objected to the
   word 'catholic,' which they claimed as their monopoly, and to the
   antithetical part as being offensive to them, and excluded the document
   from the official acts. The Lutheran Confession was ready the 20th of
   September, but was even refused a public reading. [1060]

   The Protestants sent a deputation to the king, who received them and
   their confessions with courtesy and kindness; but the Romanists
   demanded more alterations than the Protestants were willing to make,
   and used every effort to prevent the official publication of heresies.
   Unfortunately the dissensions among the Lutherans, and between them and
   the Reformed, strengthened the Romish party. The Colloquy closed Nov.
   21, 'mutua valedictione et in fraterna caritate,' but without
   accomplishing its end. Calixtus says: 'The Colloquy was no colloquy at
   all, certainly no colloquium caritativum, but irritativum.' It left the
   three confessions where they were before, and added new fuel to the
   syncretistic controversy in Germany, [1061] Calovius and Hülsemann
   charged Calixtus with aiding the Calvinists in their confession. The
   city of Thorn, which spent 50,000 guilders for the conference, suffered
   much from the Thirty-Years' War, also by a plague, and became the scene
   of a dreadful massacre of Protestants, Dec. 7, 1724, stirred up by the
   Jesuits in revenge for an attack on their college.

   The Declaration of Thorn [1062] is one of the most careful statements
   of the Reformed Creed, and the only one among the three confessions of
   this Colloquy which acquired a practical importance by its adoption
   among the three Brandenburg Confessions. It is divided into a general
   part (generales professio) and a special declaration (specialis
   declaratio). The former acknowledges the canonical Scriptures of the
   Old and New Testaments in the original Hebrew and Greek, as the only
   perfect rule of faith, containing all that is necessary for our
   salvation. It adopts, also, in a subordinate sense, as explanatory
   summaries of Scripture doctrine, the oecumenical Creeds, and doctrinal
   decisions of the ancient undivided Church in opposition to the
   trinitarian, christological, and Pelagian heresies. [1063] Finally, as
   regards the controversy with Rome, it accepts the Altered Augsburg
   Confession and the Consensus of Sendomir (1570) as correct statements
   of the Scripture doctrines, differing in form, but agreeing in essence.

   The 'Special Declaration' states the several articles of the Reformed
   system, both in its agreement with, and in its departure from, the
   creeds of Romanists and Lutherans.

   The document is signed by a number of noblemen and clergymen from
   Poland, Lithuania, and Brandenburg.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1052] Some writers, including Voltaire, trace the change to political
   motives--viz., that Sigismund wished to secure the friendship of
   Holland and England--but without proof. On the contrary, it was bad
   policy, and in its immediate effect rendered the Elector very unpopular
   among his German fellow-sovereigns and his own people. 'Kein Wort,'
   says Böckel, p. 427, 'keine Handlung des Kurfürsten Johann Sigismund
   verräth, dass ihn irgend eine unreine Nebenabsicht geleitet habe.' See
   also Möller and Hollenberg, l.c.

   [1053] See Hutter's Calvinista aulico-politicus.

   [1054] Dr. Tholuck (Geist der luther. Theologen Wittenbergs, p. 118,
   referring to Hartknoch's Preuss. Kirchenhistorie, p. 544) mentions the
   fact that Anna, the wife of Sigismund, in her will and testament
   ordered her chaplain in the funeral sermon to disown the Calvinistic
   (?) heresy that Christ's blood and death are merely a man's blood and
   death.

   [1055] The Emperor replied: 'Das wage ich von meinen Dienern nicht zu
   fordern.' The same Elector Augustus said that 'if he had only one
   Calvinistic vein in his body, he wished the devil (sic!) would pull it
   out.'

   [1056] Dr. Hülsemann of Wittenberg traced the charitable hope of
   Calixtus that he would meet many Reformed in heaven to the inspiration
   of the devil ('spes dubio procul a diabolo inspirata'). Calixtus asked,
   Who inspired this opinion of Hülsemann? Leyser wrote a book to show
   that communion with Papists was preferable to communion with
   Calvinists. Another book of that age professed to prove that 'the
   damned Calvinistic heretics have six hundred and sixty-six theses in
   common with the Turks.' The French Reformed Synod of Charenton in 1631
   sanctioned the admission of Lutheran sponsors in baptism on the ground
   of essential agreement of the Augsburg Confession with the Reformed
   doctrine. This resolution was pronounced 'atheistic' by Lutherans as
   well as Romanists. The spirit of Lutheran bigotry in that classical
   period of polemic confessionalism and exclusivism is well characterized
   and illustrated by Dr. Tholuck, in his Geist der luther. Theologen
   Wittenbergs im 17ten Jahrh. (1852), pp. 115, 169, 211, etc. Comp. also

   [1057] See Lücke's treatise, Ueber das Alter, den Verfasser, etc., des

   Rupertus Meldenius, the obscure author of Parænesis votiva pro pace
   ecclesiæ ad theologos Augustanæ Confessionis (before 1635), directed
   against the philodoxia and philoneikia of the theologians, and
   commending humility and love of peace. Here the sentence occurs, 'Si
   nos servaremus in necessariis Unitatem, in non necessariis Libertatem,
   in utrisque Caritatem, optimo certe loco essent res nostræ.' A copy of
   the first edition of this book, though without date, is preserved in

   [1061] Hence the distich on the Synod of Thorn: 'Quid synodus? nodus:
   Patrum chorus integer? æger: Conventus? ventus: Gloria? stramen. Amen.'

   [1062] The full title is 'Professio Doctrinæ Ecclesiarum Reformatarum

   in Conventu Thoruniensi, Anni 1645, ad liquidationem Controversiarum
   maturandam, exhibita d. 1 Septembris.' First published at Berlin, 1646,
   under the title 'Scripta partis Reformatæ in Colloquio Thoruniensi,'
   etc.

   [1063] In the expression of agreement with the ancient Church the
   Declaration of Thorn is more explicit than any other Protestant
   confession, Lutheran or Calvinistic or Anglican. After saying that the
   summary of Scripture doctrine is contained in the Apostles' Creed, the
   Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Words of Institution of
   Baptism and the Lord's Supper, the Declaration proceeds: 'Si quid vero,
   in hisce Doctrinæ Christianæ capitibus, dubitationis aut controversiæ
   de genuino eorum sensu exoriatur, profitemur porro, nos amplecti ceu
   interpretationem Scripturarum certam et indubitatam, Symbolum Nicænum

   fidem Christi profitentur, necessario conveniunt, et Fundamentum firmum
   et unicum, contra quod portæ inferorum nunquam prævalebunt, proponitur.
   'Cui etiam consonare Symbolum, quod dicitur Athanasianum, agnoscimus:
   nec non Ephesinæ primæ, et Chalcedonensis Synodi Confessiones:

   credidit, docuit, idem nos quoque ex Scripturis credere et docere
   profitemur. 'Hoc igitur Fidei nostræ professione, tanquam Christiani
   vere Catholici, ab omnibus veteribus et recentibus Hæresibus, quas
   prisca universalis Ecclesia unanimi consensu ex Scripturis rejecit
   atque damnavit, nos nostrasque Ecclesias segregamus.'

   § 71. Minor German Reformed Confessions.

   Heinrich Heppe: Die Bekenntniss-Schriften der reformirten Kirchen
   Deutschlands. Elberfeld, 1860. (Contains nine confessions of secondary
   importance, most of which are not found in other collections.)

   The remaining Confessions of the Reformed Churches in Germany have only
   a local importance, and may be briefly disposed of.

   1. The Confession of Elector Frederick III. of the Palatinate,
   1577.--It was his last will and testament, and was published after his
   death by his son, John Casimir. It may be regarded as an explanatory
   appendix to the Heidelberg Catechism. It is a clear and strong
   testimony of his catholic and evangelical faith, and contains some
   wholesome warnings against the unchristian intolerance of the princes
   and theologians of his age. [1064]

   2. The Confession of Anhalt, or Repetitio Anhaltina (i.e., a Repetition
   of the Augsburg Confession), 1581. [1065] --It was prepared chiefly by
   Wolfgang Amling, Superintendent of Anhalt, and laid before a conference
   with Hessian divines held at Cassel, March, 1579.

   The duchy of Anhalt, on the banks of the Elbe and Saale (formerly
   divided into four duchies, called after the principal towns,
   Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Zerbst, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Cöthen, in 1853
   united into two, 1863 into one) embraced the Lutheran reformation in
   1534, but during the controversies which led to the Formula Concordiæ
   it adhered to Melanchthon, and finally passed over to the Reformed
   faith in 1596. Prince John George married a daughter of Prince Casimir
   of the Palatinate, and introduced the Heidelberg Catechism and a
   simpler form of worship. At a later period (1644) Lutheranism was
   partly re-established, but Dessau, Bernburg, and Cöthen remained
   Reformed.

   The 'Anhalt Repetition' can scarcely be numbered among the Reformed
   Confessions. It belongs to the Melanchthonian transition period, and
   represents simply a milder type of Lutheranism in opposition to the
   Flacian party. It recognizes, along with the Altered Augsburg
   Confession and the Corpus Doctrinæ of Melanchthon, the Smalcald
   Articles and Luther's Catechisms, and professes even the manducatio
   oralis and the manducatio indignorum. [1066] This is clearly
   incompatible with the Reformed system of doctrine.

   3. The Confession of Nassau, 1578, prepared, at the request of Count
   John of Nassau-Dillenburg, by the Rev. Christopher Pezel, who had been
   expelled from Saxony for Crypto-Calvinism. It was adopted by a general
   synod of that country, and first printed in 1593. It is Melanchthonian
   in the sense of the Altered Augsburg Confession and the Confession of
   Saxony, and rejects the doctrine of ubiquity as an unscriptural
   innovation and fiction. [1067]

   4. The Bremen Confession (Consensus Ministerii Bremensis), prepared,
   1598, by the same Pezel, who in the mean time had removed to Bremen,
   and signed by the pastors of that city. It is more decidedly Reformed,
   and adopts the Calvinistic view of predestination. Among, the books
   herein approved and recommended to the study of the pastors are also
   the Geneva Harmonia Confessionum, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Decades
   of Bullinger, and the Institutes of Calvin, as well as the works of
   Melanchthon. [1068]

   5. The Hessian Confession, adopted by a General Synod at Cassel, A.D.
   1607, and published 1608. [1069] It treats only of five articles: the
   Ten Commandments, the abolition of popish picture idolatry, the Person
   of Christ (against ubiquity), the eternal election, and the Lord's
   Supper (against the manducatio indignorum). The Heidelberg Catechism
   and a modification of Luther's Small Catechism were both used in
   Electoral Hesse. [1070]

   6. The Confession of the Heidelberg Theologians, of 1607, is an
   exposition of what the Reformed Churches of Germany believe, and what
   they reject. [1071]

   7. The Catechism of Emden, 1554, prepared, after the model of Calvin's
   Catechism, by John a Lasko, or Laski (1499-1560), a converted nobleman
   and reformer of Poland. It was used in the Reformed Church of East
   Friesland, where he labored several years. It was afterwards superseded
   by the Heidelberg Catechism, which is partly based upon it. [1072]

   [1066] Ebrard (Kirchen- and Dogmengeschichte, Vol. III. p. 575) is
   certainly wrong when he says that the Repetitio Anhaltina proves that
   the Anhalt clergy 'schon damals ganz und gar reformirt über die Person
   Christi und das h. Abendmahl dachte.' It expressly asserts in Art. vii.
   that even 'indigne viscentes non quidem nudum aut communem panem
   calicemque manducant et bibunt, sed ipsum corpus et sanguinem Domini in
   Sacramento Coenæ manducantes et bibentes . . . rei fiunt corporis et

   HUS [1073] AND THE HUSSITES.

   The reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia (now a political division of
   the Austro-Hungarian Empire), began with John Hus and Jerome of Prague,
   who were influenced by the doctrines of Wycliffe, and who carried with
   them the greater part of the population, the Slavic Czechs. They were
   condemned by the oecumenical Council of Constance as heretics, and
   burned at the stake, the former July 6, 1415, the latter May 30, 1416.
   But their martyrdom provoked the Husite wars which would have resulted
   in the triumph of the Husites, had not internal divisions broken their
   strength.

   The followers of Hus were, from 1420, divided into two parties, the
   conservative Calixtines, so called from their zeal for the chalice
   (calix) of the laity, or Utraquists (communio sub utraque specie), and
   the radical Taborites, so named from a steep mountain which their blind
   but brave and victorious leader, Ziska (d. 1424), fortified and called
   Mount Tabor. The Calixtines accepted the compromise of communion in
   both kinds, which the Council of Basle offered to them (1433), and
   mostly returned to the Roman Church. The Taborites rejected all
   compromise with the hated papal Antichrist, and demanded a thorough
   reformation, but they were defeated by the allied Romanists and
   Calixtines near Prague, 1434, and subdued by George Podiebrad, 1453.

   THE BOHEMIAN BRETHERN.

   From this time the Taborites disappeared as a party, but from their
   remnants arose, about 1457, a new and a more important sect, the Unitas
   Fratrum (Jednota bratrská), as they called themselves, or the Bohemian
   Brethren. [1074] They adhered to the rigid discipline of the Taborites,
   but were free from their fanaticism and violence. They endeavored to
   reproduce, in peaceful retirement from the world, the simplicity and
   spirituality of the Apostolic Church as they understood it. They held
   to the Bohemian version of the Bible revised by Hus [1075] as their
   only standard of faith and conduct. They rejected worldly amusements,
   oaths, military service, and capital punishment; they opposed the
   secular power of the clergy, and denounced the Pope of Rome as
   Antichrist. At first they received the sacraments from Calixtine and
   Romish priests who joined them.

   In 1467 they effected an independent organization at a synodical
   meeting held in the village of Lhota, which was attended by about fifty
   members, priests and laymen, scholars and peasants, under the lead of
   Michael, formerly a Catholic priest. After praying and fasting, they
   elected by lot (Acts i. 26) three priests out of their number, and laid
   hands on them. Then they were all solemnly rebaptized. But not
   satisfied with this independent reconstruction of the Church, they
   sought regular ordination from a Waldensian bishop, Stephen of Austria,
   who was reported to have been ordained by a Roman bishop in 1434, and
   who afterwards suffered martyrdom in Vienna. Stephen ordained Michael;
   Michael ordained Matthias of Kunwald, and then, laying down his
   dignity, asked to be ordained afresh by Matthias, who was the first of
   the three elected by lot, and significantly bore the name of the
   supplementary apostle. This shows the vacillation of the Brethren
   between Presbyterianism and Episcopacy, as well as between radical
   independency and historical conservatism. [1076] But they retained, or
   meant to retain, an unbroken succession of the episcopate, and
   transmitted it afterwards to the Moravian Church. [1077]

   The Brethren were cruelly persecuted; many were tortured and burned;
   others fled to neighboring Moravia, where for a short season they were
   unmolested. In the beginning of the sixteenth century they numbered in
   Bohemia about 200,000 members with 400 parishes. They had three
   printing establishments in 1519, while the Romanists had only one, and
   the Utraquists two. They made valuable contributions to evangelical
   hymnology. Their most fruitful author was Lucas of Prague (d. 1528),
   who did more for the organization of the society than its founder
   Gregor, and wrote over eighty books. [1078]

   THE WALDENSES.

   Literature.

   I. The Waldensian MSS., mostly in the libraries of Geneva, Cambridge,
   Dublin, and Strasburg. The older prints are not reliable. See a
   description of these MSS. in Herzog, Die romanischen Waldenser, pp. 46
   sqq. The Morland MSS. of Cambridge were brought to light again by Henry
   Bradshaw, 1862.

   II. The accounts of mediæval Catholic writers: Bernard Abbas Fontis
   Calidi (Fonte Claude, d. 1193); Alanus de Insulis (d. 1202); Stephanus
   de Borbone (Etienne de Bourbon, d. 1225); Yvonet (1275); Rainerius
   (1250); Pseudo-Rainerius; Moneta of Cremona; Gualter Mapes, of Oxford.

   Roman Catholic historians are apt to confound the Waldenses with the
   heretical Albigenses and Cathari, and include them in the same
   condemnation; while some of the older Protestant historians reverse the
   process to clear the Albigenses of the charge of Manicheism.

   III. Historical works, mostly in the interest of the Waldenses:

   Soon after their organization the Brethren came into friendly contact
   with the older and like-minded Waldenses (Vaudois), so called from
   their founder, Peter Waldo, or Waldus, a lay evangelist of Lyons (about
   1170), who gave his rich possessions to the poor. They called
   themselves originally the Poor of Lyons, who by voluntary poverty and
   celibacy aimed at evangelical perfection. [1079] The early confessional
   and catechetical books of the two sects are closely connected. The
   Brethren derived, as already noted, their episcopate from the
   Waldenses, and in 1497 they sent two delegates, Lucas of Prague and
   Thomas of Landskron (Germanus), to France and Italy, who reported that
   the Waldenses in those countries were far advanced in the knowledge of
   Scripture truth, while elsewhere they found nothing but false doctrine,
   superstition, loose discipline, and corrupt morals. [1080] On the other
   hand, many of the exiled Waldenses, who spread in every direction,
   [1081] emigrated to Bohemia, attracted by the religious commotions of
   that country, and coalesced with the Brethren into one community.

   The Bohemian Brethren and the Waldenses made a near approach to
   evangelical Protestantism, and are the only mediæval sects which have
   maintained their existence to this day. But we must distinguish between
   their position before and their position after the Reformation, which
   marks an important epoch in their creed. Much confusion (as Gieseler
   observes) has been introduced into their history both by friend and
   foe.

   The Waldenses formed at first no separate church, but an ecclesiola in
   ecclesia, a pious lay community of Bible-readers. They were well-versed
   in Scripture, and maintained its supremacy over the traditions of men;
   they preached the gospel to the poor, allowing women also to preach;
   and gradually rejected the papal hierarchy, purgatory, prayers for the
   dead, the worship of saints and relics, the mass, transubstantiation,
   the oath, and capital punishment. Being excommunicated by Lucius III.
   (1184) and other popes as schismatics and heretics, they seceded and
   became a persecuted church. They had a clergy of their own with
   bishops, priests, and deacons. The origin and succession of their
   orders are involved in obscurity. They survived the fierce persecutions
   in France and the valleys of Piedmont, and extended their influence
   through emigrants to other countries, kindling a zeal for the study of
   the Scriptures in the vernacular, and strengthening the opposition to
   the papal Church. When they heard the glad tidings of the Reformation,
   they sent a deputation--Morel and Masson--to OEcolampadius, Bucer, and
   other reformers, in 1530, and derived from them clearer views of the
   distinction between canonical and apocryphal books, justification by
   faith, election and free-will, the marriage of the clergy, and the
   nature and number of sacraments. At a synod in the valley of Angrogne,
   Sept. 12-18, 1532, which was attended also by Farel and two other
   Reformed preachers of French Switzerland, the Reformation was adopted
   by a large majority, and subsequently carried out. Since that time the
   Waldenses became and remained a regular branch of the Reformed Church.
   [1082]

   In the course of time the consciousness of this change was obscured,
   and in their polemic zeal against Romanism they traced the Reformed
   doctrines to their fathers, who certainly prepared the way for them.
   Their manuscripts were interpolated and assigned to a much earlier
   date. [1083] Some of their historians even constructed an imaginary
   Waldensian succession of pure evangelical catholicity up to the
   apostolic age, in opposition to the papal succession of an apostate
   pseudo-catholicity, which they dated from the fictitious donation of
   Constantine to Pope Sylvester and the consequent secularization of the
   Church. This is the Protestant counterpart of the Romish caricatures of
   the Reformation, and deserves equal condemnation in the name of common
   honesty and historical truth.

   A critical examination and comparison of the Waldensian manuscripts and
   the reports of the conferences with the Reformers have exposed these
   literary frauds, and produced at first a reaction against the Waldenses
   and in favor of the Bohemian Brethren, from whom some of their books
   were supposed to be derived. But on still further examination it
   appears that there was a mutual exchange of views and writings between
   the two, and that the assertions of some later Bohemian Brethren
   concerning their independence are as little to be trusted and as
   clearly unfounded as the claims of the Waldenses. Their oldest
   writings, from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, were popular
   translations of the Scriptures and extracts from the fathers, followed
   by more extended works, such as La Nobla Leyczon [1084] (i.e., lectio,
   a didactic poem on Bible history and an exhortation to repentance), the
   Cantica, an allegorical exposition, or application rather, of the Song
   of Songs, and several poems and ascetic tracts. The second class
   embraces the writings of the fifteenth century (on Purgatory, the
   Invocation of Saints, and the Sacraments), which are more or less
   dependent on the Confessio Taboritarum (1433), and other Hussite
   documents. [1085] The third class was not composed or put into its
   present shape till after the adoption of the Reformation in 1532. Their
   chief confession is based upon the Gallican (1559), and was issued
   during the fearful massacre of 1655. [1086]

   The indebtedness of the Waldenses to the Reformation for a purer creed
   does not deprive them of a claim to the deep sympathy of all Protestant
   Christians, which in the period of their fiercest persecution in
   Piedmont (1655) provoked the threat of Cromwell to make the thunder of
   English cannon resound in the castle of St. Angelo, and inspired the
   sublime sonnet of Milton--

   'Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones

   Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold;

   Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,

   When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones.

   Forget not: in thy book record their groans,

   Who were thy sheep, and in their ancient fold

   Slain by the bloody Piedmontese, that rolled

   Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans

   The vales redoubled to the hills, and they

   To heaven. Their martyred blood and ashes sow

   O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway

   The triple tyrant; that from these may grow

   A hundredfold, who having learnt thy way

   Early may fly the Babylonian woe.'

   The last lines sound like a prophecy; for since the day of liberty
   dawned on Italy (in 1848), that venerable martyr church has, from its
   mountain retreats in Piedmont, with youthful vigor established missions
   in nearly all the cities of the peninsula.

   THE WALDENSIAN CATECHISM (1489) AND THE BOHEMIAN CATECHISM (1521).

   The doctrinal affinity of the Waldenses and the Bohemian Brethren
   appears especially in their Catechisms, which are the most important of
   all their writings before the Reformation, and which prove their zeal
   for Christian education on the basis of the Scriptures. They bear such
   a striking resemblance to each other that the one must be in part a
   copy from the other. The Waldensian Catechism has a better claim to
   originality, and, although not nearly as old as was formerly supposed,
   [1087] must have been written before 1500; while the Bohemian, in the
   form in which it was presented to Luther, first appeared in print in
   1521 or 1522, and was probably the work of Lucas of Prague (d. 1528),
   who had visited the Waldenses in Italy and France (1489). But both rest
   probably on older sources. Palacky brought to light (1869) a similar
   Catechism, which he derives from Hus before 1414. [1088]

   The Waldensian Catechism, called 'The Smaller Questions,' [1089]
   intended for children, is a remarkable production for an age of
   prevailing popular superstition and ignorance. It consists of
   fifty-seven questions by the teacher (lo barba, i.e., uncle), and as
   many answers by the pupil (l'enfant). It embodies the Apostles' Creed,
   the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and is divided into three
   divisions--Faith (Ques. 6), Hope (Ques. 32), and Love (Ques. 47). This
   division was suggested by St. Paul (1 Cor. xiii. 13) and Augustine
   (Enchiridion), and is followed also in the Greek Catechism of Mogila
   and the Russian Catechism of Philaret. Under the head of Faith we have
   a practical exposition of the Apostles' Creed and the Ten Commandments,
   showing their subjective bearing on a living faith. In the Second Part
   (Ques. 32), Love is defined to be a gift of the Holy Spirit and an
   intimate union of the human will with the divine will. In the Third
   Part (Ques. 48), Hope is defined to be a certain expectation of grace
   and future glory. The Catechism is directed against the idolatry and
   superstition of the anti-Christian Church, but the opposition is
   indirect and moderate. The characteristic Waldensian features are the
   distinction between a living and a dead faith (Ques. 8); the six
   evangelical commandments (Ques. 21); the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit
   (Ques. 23); the distinction between the true or essential (invisible)
   Church (la gleisa de la part de la substancia), which consists of all
   the elect of God in Christ, known only to him, and the outward or
   institutional (visible) church (de la part de li menisteri), i.e., the
   ministers and the people subject to them (Ques. 35); and the rigid
   exposition of the second commandment against all forms of idolatry
   (Ques. 29). Of the sacraments it is said (Ques. 46): 'Two are
   absolutely necessary for all; the rest are less necessary.' This
   clearly indicates that the Catechism was written before the Reformation
   period, when the Waldenses rejected all but two sacraments.

   The Bohemian Catechism is longer, having seventy-five questions and
   answers. It follows the "Waldensian in the general arrangement and
   first part, and introduces also (like the Greek catechisms) the
   Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount (Ques. 31); it has more to say
   of idolatry, the worship of Mary, the saints and martyrs, and
   especially on the Lord's Supper; but these additions lack perspicuity,
   and are too long for the use of children.

   The following specimen will give an idea of these Catechisms, and the
   relation they sustain to each other and to the Catechism ascribed to
   Hus:

   Catechism.

   7. Qual cosa es la fè? 7. What is faith? 7. Bewer das.
   Di. Segond l'apostol Heb. xi. es subsistencia de las cosas de sperar e

   not seen. [1092] A. S. Paul' sagt zu den Juden, es ist vnmüglich Gott

   creire esser Dio, creyre a Dio, creyre de Dio, e non creire en Dio.
   [1097] According to St. James, faith which has no works is dead in
   itself; faith is idle without works. Or dead faith is to believe that
   God is, to believe about God, of God, but not to believe in God. [1098]
   A. Ich gelaub in Gott vatter almechtigen, etc.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [1073] Hus (i.e., Goose) and Hussites (from the Bohemian genitive
   Husses) is the correct spelling, followed by Palacky and Gindely,
   instead of Huss and Husites.

   [1074] This name applies also to the members who emigrated to Moravia,
   Saxony, and Poland; but the name Moravian Brethren does not occur until
   the 18th century, when Zinzendorf incorporated into his own society
   (the Moravians, properly so called) the last survivors of the Bohemian
   brotherhood, who had come from Moravia to Saxony. See Gindely, Vol. I.
   p. 36. They were also called Waldenses, and in derision Picards
   (probably the same as Beghards) and Grubenheimer, Pit-dwellers (because
   they held divine service in pits and caves).

   [1075] Another Bohemian version or revision of the New Testament was
   made from the Greek by Blahoslav, a member of the Unitas Fratrum and
   the author of a Bohemian grammar (d. 1571).

   [1076] Gindely reports this from the scanty and conflicting sources,
   and adds the remark (Vol. I. p. 37): 'Es zeigt das Schwanken des
   Gemüths und den Zweifel an die Berechtigung der gethanen Schritte, dass
   die Brüder in ihren Schriften gleich nach der Wahl jede Differenz
   zwischen priesterlicher and bischöflicher Würde verwarfen, mil
   ängstlicher Gewissenhaftigkeit aber bei sich die letztere einführten.'

   [1077] The last bishop of the old Unitas Fratrum was John Amos Comenius
   (or Komensky, a Czech, born in Moravia, 1592, died at Amsterdam, 1671),
   who acquired great celebrity by his new method of instruction by
   pictures and illustrations, and by his Janua Linguarum reserrata and
   his Orbis pictus. His nephew, D. E. Jablonsky, was elected and ordained
   bishop by a Synod of Bohemian Brethren in Poland, 1698, and he ordained
   David Nitschmann, the first bishop of the Moravians, 1735. See E. von
   Schweinitz, The Moravian Episcopate (Bethlehem, Pa., 1865; comp. his
   art. Moravian Church, in Johnson's Univ. Cyclop. Vol. III.), and
   Benham, Origin and Episcopate of the Bohemian Brethren (Lond. 1867).
   The Moravian episcopate depends on the Bohemian, and the Bohemian on
   the Waldensian episcopate, which in the thirteenth century did not
   claim to rest on apostolic succession. Comp. the quotations in
   Gieseler, Kirchengesh. Vol. II. Pt. II. pp. 640, 641.

   Herzog's Encyklop., Supplem. Vol. XX. pp 23 sqq., 31. Gindely, however,
   places no high estimate on the writings of Lucas, and charges him with
   great obscurity. They are mostly extant in manuscript.

   [1079] The Dominican Stephen of Borbone says: 'Incepit hæc secta circa
   annum ab incarnatione Domini 1170 . . . Waldenses dicti sunt a primo
   huius hæresis auctore, qui nominatus fuit Waldensis. Dicuntur etiam
   Pauperes de Lugduno quia ibi inceperunt in professione paupertatis.'
   They were also called Leonistæ, from Leona, Lyons; Sabatati, from their
   wooden sandals (sabot); and Humiliati, from their humility.

   [1080] Joachim Camerarius, in his Historica narratio de Fratrum orthod.
   ecclesiis in Bohemia (ed. by his grandson, Heidelb. 1605), gives a full
   account of two deputations of the Brethren to the Waldenses, one in
   1467, and the other in 1497. See Herzog, pp. 290 sqq., and Gindely.

   on Antichrist from 1126.

   [1084] Given in the original by Herzog, pp. 444-457, from the Geneva
   MS., with the variations of the Dublin text. Herzog assigns it to the
   year 1400. Ebrard, Ueber das Alter der Nobla Leyczon, in the
   Zeitschrift für histor. Theologie, 1864, and in his Kirchengesch. Vol.
   II. p. 193, traces it to the beginning of the thirteenth century, and
   defends the date of the Geneva MS., that the work was written fully
   eleven hundred years after St. John wrote, 'It is the last time' (1
   John ii. 18), i.e., about 1200.

   [1085] See the comparison in Dieckhoff, pp. 377 sqq.

   [1086] See Vol. III. pp. 757 sqq.

   [1087] Leger, Monastier, and Hahn trace it to the beginning of the
   twelfth century.

   [1088] Dieckhoff (pp. 98-115), from an imperfect knowledge of the
   Waldensian Catechism (as given by Perrin and Leger), maintained the
   priority of the Bohemian Catechism, and charged the Waldenses with
   gross plagiarism. Dr. Herzog (pp. 324 sq.) inclined to the same
   opinion, but with some qualification, and first edited the original
   text of the Waldensian Catechism from the Dublin MSS. in the Romance
   language (pp. 438-444). Since then Prof. Von Zezschwitz, of Erlangen,
   has published (1863) both Catechisms in their authentic form, with an
   elaborate argument for the priority of the Waldensian from internal
   evidence and from its affinity with other undoubted Waldensian
   documents. Ebrard (Vol. II. p. 491) assents to this view, and says:
   'The Waldensian Catechism is thoroughly and characteristically
   Waldensian.' But Palacky traces both to a Bohemian Catechism (of about
   4 pages) which he found in the imperial library of Vienna, and
   published, with a Latin version, in his Docmnenta relating to Hus (pp.
   703, 708). The authorship of Hus, however, is a mere conjecture ('cuius
   autor Hus esse videtur'). The resemblance extends only to a few
   questions, and does not settle the point of priority; for Palacky
   himself admits that the Waldenses were in Prague as early as 1408, and
   known to Hus. 'The Hussites,' he says (Das Verhältniss der Waldenser,
   etc., p. 20), were both disciples and teachers of the Waldenses, but
   more the latter than the former.'

   § 73. The Bohemian Confessions after the Reformation. A.D. 1535 and
   1575.

   THE REFORMATION AND COUNTER-REFORMATION IN BOHEMIA.

   Comp. the work of Pescheck, quoted p. 565; and Reuss: La Destruction du
   Protestantisme en Bohème. Strasburg, 1867.

   The Reformation rekindled the fire of the Husite movement, and made
   rapid progress within and without the Catholic Church. The Bohemian
   Brethren sent, from 1520, several delegations to Wittenberg to confer
   with Luther. They received new light in doctrine, but painfully missed
   discipline in the churches of Germany. Luther was at first displeased
   with their figurative theory of the Lord's Supper, their views of
   justification, and the celibacy of the clergy, and induced them to
   conform them to his teaching, but afterwards he treated them with a
   degree of indulgence and forbearance that contrasts favorably with his
   uncompromising antagonism to the Zwinglians. Nevertheless, the Bohemian
   Brethren, like the Waldenses, ultimately passed in a body to the
   Reformed communion, with which they had more sympathy in matters of
   doctrine and discipline. [1103] Besides them we find in Bohemia, after
   the Reformation, three Protestant parties, Utraquists, Lutherans, and
   Calvinists.

   There was at one time, during the reign of Maximilian II., a fair
   prospect of the conversion of the whole Bohemian nation, as also of the
   German provinces of Austria, to Protestantism; but before the work was
   consolidated, the Jesuits, backed by the whole power of the Hapsburg
   dynasty, inaugurated a counter-reformation and a series of cruel
   persecutions which crushed the evangelical faith, and turned that
   kingdom into a second Spain. The bloody drama of the Thirty-Years' War
   began at Prague (1618). Emperor Ferdinand II. (1619-1637), a fanatical
   pupil of the Jesuits, fulfilled his terrible vow to exterminate heresy
   by all possible means, though he should have to reign over a desert.
   The execution of twenty-seven of the most distinguished Protestants, in
   June, 1621, was the signal for this war of extermination. The richest
   families were deprived of their property. Protestant worship was
   forbidden. Protestant churches, schools, and hospitals were razed to
   the ground, or turned into Jesuit churches and colleges. All Protestant
   preachers, professors, and school-teachers were ordered, in 1624, to
   leave the country within a week, under pain of death. Bohemian and
   German Bibles and all Bohemian works published after 1414, being
   suspected of heresy, were destroyed in immense quantities on
   marketplaces and beneath the gallows. One Jesuit, Anton Koniasch (1637)
   boasted that he had burned over 60,000 books. Thus the whole Czech
   literature and civilization was overwhelmed with ruin, and ignorance as
   dark as midnight spread over the land. [1104] Protestants were
   forbidden the rights of citizens; they could not carry on a trade, nor
   contract marriage, nor make a will. Even light and air were denied
   them. 'More than thirty thousand Bohemian families, and among them five
   hundred belonging to the aristocracy, went into banishment. Exiled
   Bohemians were to be found in every country of Europe, and were not
   wanting in any of the armies that fought against Austria. Those who
   could or would not emigrate held to their faith in secret. Against them
   dragonades were employed. Detachments of soldiers were sent into the
   various districts to torment the heretics till they were converted. The
   "Converters" (Seligmacher) went thus throughout all Bohemia, plundering
   and murdering. ... A desert was created; the land was crushed for a
   generation. Before the war Bohemia had 4,000,000 inhabitants, and in
   1648 there were but 700,000 or 800,000. These figures appear
   preposterous, but they are certified by Bohemian historians.' [1105]

   The exiled Bohemian Brethren became the nucleus of the Moravian
   Brotherhood (1722), and in this noble little Church, so distinguished
   for its missionary zeal, they continue to this day. Their last and
   worthy Bishop, Amos Comenius, died an exile in Holland, 1671, with the
   hope of the future revival of his persecuted Church, which was
   fulfilled through the labors of Count Zinzendorf. But even in Bohemia
   Protestantism could not be utterly annihilated. It began again to raise
   its feeble head when Emperor Joseph II. issued the Edict of Toleration
   (1781). The recent revival of Czech patriotism and literature came to
   its aid. The fifth centenary of the birth of Hus was celebrated at
   Prague, 1869, and his works and letters were published. In 1875 there
   were forty-six Reformed congregations in Bohemia and twenty-two in
   Moravia. The number of Lutheran congregations is smaller, and they
   belong almost entirely to the German part of the population.

   THE BOHEMIAN CONFESSION OF 1535.

   The Latin text in the Corpus et Syntagma Conf., and in Niemeyer, pp.
   771-818; the German text in Böckel, pp. 780-830.

   The Bohemian Brethren surpass all Churches in the number of their
   confessions of faith, which amount to no less than thirty-four from
   1467 to 1671, in the Bohemian, Latin, and German languages. [1106] But
   they were all superseded by two, respectively called the First and the
   Second Bohemian Confessions.

   The first of these confessions was prepared, after the example of the
   Lutherans at the Diet of Augsburg, in proof of their orthodoxy, signed
   by the noblemen belonging to the Unitas, and laid by a deputation
   before King Ferdinand at Vienna, Nov. 14, 1535, who promised to take it
   into consideration. [1107] It was written in Latin by an unknown
   author, probably by John Augusta, Senior of the Brethren, and, after
   the death of Lucas of Prague, their most influential leader (d. 1572),
   and with his aid it was translated into German. [1108]

   The confession consists of a long apologetic preface against the
   charges of heresy and immorality, and of twenty articles. It closely
   resembles in form and contents the Augsburg Confession. In Art. XII.,
   on Baptism, it is stated that the Brethren had formerly rebaptized
   converts, but that they had given up this practice as useless. Infant
   baptism is acknowledged (Matt. xix. 14). The doctrine of the Lord's
   Supper (Art. XIII.) is accommodated to the Lutheran theory, though
   framed somewhat vaguely. [1109]

   The Bohemians sent the confession with a deputation to the Reformers at
   Wittenberg (1536). Luther disapproved the articles on celibacy and
   justification, but after the Brethren had made some corrections he
   published the document, at their request and expense, in 1538, with a
   favorable preface. In later editions the Bohemians made many changes.
   [1110]

   THE SECOND BOHEMIAN CONFESSION. A.D. 1575.

   The Latin text in Niemeyer, pp. 819-851; the German text in Böckel, pp.
   827-849.

   The historical notices I have chiefly derived from Pescheck's
   Geschichte der Gegenreformation in Böhmen, 2d ed. Vol. I. pp. 103 sqq.,
   and from Gindely's Geschichte der Böhmischen Brüder, Vol. II. pp. 141
   sqq.

   The mild and liberal Emperor Maximilian II. (1564-1576) was kindly
   disposed towards his Protestant subjects, and had a certain degree of
   sympathy with their creed. While holding a diet at Prague he allowed
   the non-Catholic Bohemians to compose a united confession of their
   faith. The Utraquists, Lutherans, Calvinists, and Bohemian Brethren
   laid aside their disputes and agreed upon a moderate doctrinal
   statement, which is more particularly called the Bohemian Confession.
   [1111] It was prepared in the Bohemian language by two divines--Dr.
   Paul Pressius and M. Krispin [1112] --and adopted with some changes by
   the Diet of Prague. It was presented to Maximilian, May 17, 1575. He
   gave the delegates the verbal promise of protection in their faith and
   worship. It was afterwards presented to Maximilian's son and successor,
   Rudolph II., 1608, who, under the political pressure of the times, in
   an imperial letter, or charter, granted the Protestant Bohemians equal
   rights with the Roman Catholics, a separate consistory at Prague, and
   the control of the university (1609). But these concessions were of
   short duration. Emperor Matthias violated the compact, and Ferdinand
   II. annulled it by his Edict of Restitution (1629), which gave the
   Romanists full power to suppress Protestantism.

   The Second Bohemian Confession consists of an address to Maximilian II.
   and twenty-five articles on the holy Scriptures, on God, the Holy
   Trinity, the fall and original sin, free-will, the law, justification,
   faith and good works, the Church, the sacraments, etc. It is in
   essential agreement with the Augsburg Confession and the older Bohemian
   Confession. The doctrine of the Lord's Supper is conformed to the later
   Melanchthonian view. A German translation was transmitted to the
   divines at Wittenberg, and approved by them Nov. 3, 1575. A Latin
   translation appeared in 1619.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1103] They wrote afterwards to Beza (Dec. 3, 1575): 'Lutherus nostra
   sic fuit interpretatus, quasi ipsius sententiæ sint consentanea, sua
   quidem ille culpa, non nostra.' Zezschwitz, p. 153; Ebrard, Vol. III.
   p. 400. They had sent a deputation to Bucer and Calvin at Strasburg in
   1510, who were well received.

   [1104] See, on this wholesale destruction of books, Pescheck's
   Geschichte der Gegenreformation in Böhmen, Vol. II. pp. 93 sqq.
   Bohemian works published from 1414 to 1635 are exceedingly rare, or are
   to be found only outside of Bohemia in the libraries at Herrnhut,
   Dresden, and Leipzig.

   [1105] Heusser, The Period of the Reformation, English translation, New
   York, 1874, p. 426. Dr. Döllinger, in his concluding address at the
   Bonn Union Conference in August, 1875, speaking of the suppression of
   the Reformation in Austria, made the following remarks: 'Nach römischer
   Lehre ist eine katholische Regierung verpflichtet, die Andersgläubigen
   zu unterdrücken. Die Päpste haben die Habsburger durch die Jesuiten
   stets zur Befolgung dieser Lehre angehalten. In der zweiten Hälfte des
   sechszehnten Jahrhunderts war die Bevölkerung in einigen überwiegend
   deutschen Erbstaaten fast zu neun Zehntel protestantisch. Durch das
   System der Zwangsbekehrung und der Austreibung der Protestanten wurde
   am Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts and im 17. der römische Katholicismus
   wieder herrschend. Die wenigen Schriftsteller, welche Oesterreich im
   17ten Jahrhundert hatte, klagen einmüthig über den Schaden, den die
   Protestanten-Austreibung dem Wohlstand Oesterreichs gebracht. Man darf
   sagen, es macht sich noch heute fühlbar, dass damals der beste Theil
   der städtischen Bevölkerung vertrieben wurde. Sine grosse geistige
   Versumpfung ist die Folge der engen Verbindung der Habsburger Dynastie
   mit der Curie gewesen. Ich sage: der Habsburgischen Dynastie; die
   jetzige Dynastie ist die lothringische, aus welcher ganz andere
   Regenten hervorgegangen sind. Ihr gehört Joseph II. an, aber auch die
   andern Kaiser dieser Dynastie haben nicht ihre Unterthanen um der
   Religion willen unterdrückt. Oesterreich leidet noch jetzt an den
   schlimmen Folgen früherer Missregierungen, aber es ist ein Staat, der
   noch eine Zukunft hat, und sein neues Emporblühen ist von grosser
   Wichtigkeit für Europa. Wenn wir den Satz des Herrn; an ihren Früchten
   sollt ihr sie erkennen, auf das Papalsystem anwenden, so können wir nur
   ein hartes Urtheil über dasselbe fällen. Das jetzige Verhalten des
   römischen Stuhles zeigt aber, dass er aus der Weltgeschichte nichts
   gelernt hat, dass sie ihm ein mit sieben Siegeln verschlossenes Buch
   ist.'

   [1112] A new chapter in the history of Bohemia--now called
   Czechoslovakia--and of the followers of Huss was opened with the war,
   1914. After nearly 400 years of subjection to Austria, the country
   gained its freedom and was made a republic, with T. G. Masaryk, who had
   spent some time in the U. S., as president, 1918. Religious liberty was
   established, the statue of Mary, erected on the central square of Prag,
   pulled down, and a massive monument dedicated to Huss with an address
   by Masaryk. The 'Czechoslovak National Reformed Catholic Church,' now
   constituting 4 per cent, of the population, was organized, 1920, and
   occupies a position midway between Romanism and Protestantism, leaning
   to the Greek Church. Its first bishop received consecration from a
   Serbian bishop. It uses the national tongue in worship and practises
   clerical marriage and the elective principle in the choice of its
   bishops. The Hussites, adopting the name 'The Evangelical Union of
   Bohemian Brethren,' have doubled in numbers and carry on a theological
   seminary in Prag with a full faculty, partly supported by the state and
   occupying quarters in the university buildings. In 1925 the papal
   nuncio, as a protest at the part taken by Masaryk and the government at
   a Huss celebration, left Prag. Papal relations were re-established,
   1927. Masaryk holds the degree of doctor of theology from the
   theological seminary in Prag for a thesis on Huss.--Ed.

   The history of the Reformation in Poland is as sad as that in Bohemia.
   It started with fair prospects of success, but was suppressed by the
   counter-reformation under the energetic and unscrupulous leadership of
   the Jesuits, who took advantage of the dissensions among Protestants,
   the weakness of the court, and the fickleness of the nobility, obtained
   the control of the education of the aristocracy and clergy, and
   ultimately brought that unfortunate kingdom to the brink of internal
   ruin before its political dismemberment by the surrounding powers.

   POLAND IN THE SIXTEEN CENTURY.

   Poland became a mighty kingdom by the union with Lithuania (1386) and
   the successful wars with the Teutonic order in Prussia. In the middle
   of the sixteenth century it extended from the shores of the Baltic to
   the Black Sea, and embraced Great Poland (Posen), Little Poland
   (Warsaw), Lithuania, Samogitia (Wilna), Courland, Livonia, Esthland,
   Podlesia, Volhynia, Podolia, Ukraine, and the Prussian territories of
   Dantzic, Culm, and Ermeland. The population was Slavonic, with a large
   number of Germans and Jews. It originally received Christianity from
   the Greek Church, through Bohemia, but, owing to its close connection
   with the German empire, it became, like Bohemia, Roman Catholic during
   the tenth century. The government was in the hands of the nobility,
   which controlled the king. The power of the Church was restricted to
   spiritual affairs, and weakened by the immorality of the clergy.

   THE REFORMATION.

   Poland never showed special devotion to the Roman See, and during the
   Council of Constance manifested some sympathy with the reform of Hus.
   Waldenses, Bohemians, and all classes of Protestants, even Socinians
   and Anabaptists, found hospitable shelter.

   The Lutheran Reformation was introduced by Polish students returning
   from Wittenberg, and by Lutheran tutors employed in the families of the
   nobles. It triumphed in the German cities of Dantzic (1525) and Thorn
   (1530).

   Among the Slavonic population and the higher nobility, and in the
   University of Cracow, Calvinism made rapid progress. It was patronized
   by Prince Nicholas Radziwill, the Chancellor of Poland under King
   Sigismund Augustus II. (1548-1572). The king himself corresponded with
   Calvin, and read his 'Institutes' with great zeal. Calvin dedicated to
   him his Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in some
   remarkable letters solemnly urged him to use the favorable opportunity
   for the introduction of the pure doctrine and worship of Christ before
   the door might be forever closed. In a large kingdom with strongly
   feudal institutions he would allow, for the sake of unity and order,
   and after the model of the ancient Church, the episcopal organization,
   with an archbishop and a regular succession; but he thought that under
   the circumstances the Reformation could not be introduced without some
   irregularity, since the papal bishops had become the open enemies of
   the gospel. He became at last discouraged by the indecision of the
   king, and lost confidence in the sincerity of the nobles. His fears
   were only too well realized. [1113]

   Another powerful element were the Bohemian Brethren, who, driven from
   their native land in 1548, emigrated in large numbers and organized
   forty congregations in Great Poland. [1114] They were well received,
   and, by the affinity of race and language, their purity, simplicity,
   and strict discipline, they made a deep impression on the Slavonic
   Poles. The Brethren united with the Calvinists at the first general
   Protestant Synod held at Kosminek, 1555. The latter adopted the
   confession, liturgy, and episcopal government of the former. This step
   was highly approved by Calvin, who wrote to a Polish nobleman,
   Stanislaus Krasinski: 'From a union with the Waldenses [as the Brethren
   were sometimes called] I hope the best, not only because God blesses
   every act of a holy union of the members of Christ, but also because at
   the present crisis the experience of the Waldenses, who are so well
   drilled in the service of the Lord, will be of no small benefit to
   you.' He also advocated union with the adherents of the Augsburg
   Confession as this was understood and explained by its author. He was
   invited by the nobility to Poland, but could not leave Geneva.

   JOHN A LASCO.

   In Calvin's place appeared, by his advice and probably at the
   invitation of the king, John a Lasco, or Laski, a Polish nobleman,
   distinguished among the Reformers of the second rank. Born at Warsaw,
   1499, and educated for the priesthood by his uncle, the Archbishop of
   Gnesen and Primas of Poland, he made a literary journey to Holland and
   Switzerland, and became personally acquainted with Zwingli at Zurich
   (1524) and with Erasmus at Basle (1525), who shook his faith in the
   Roman Church. [1115] On his return to Poland he endeavored to introduce
   a moderate reformation, but the country was not prepared for it. He
   declined an offer to a bishopric, and sacrificed bright prospects to
   his conviction, preferring to be in a foreign land 'a poor servant of
   Christ crucified for him.' He labored several years as Reformed pastor
   in Emden, East Friesland, until the Interim troubles drove him and his
   friends to England. He organized in London three congregations of
   Dutch, German, French, and Italian emigrants (ecclesiæ peregrinorum) on
   a Presbyterian and voluntary basis, under the protection of Archbishop
   Cranmer and Edward VI. The persecution of Queen Mary forced him again
   to wander in exile. When he landed with a hundred and seventy-five
   members of his flock in Denmark, 1553, he was refused shelter in cold
   winter because he could not subscribe to the Lutheran doctrine of the
   real presence. He fully experienced the force of his motto, 'The pious
   have no home on earth, for they seek heaven.' After laboring a short
   time in a congregation of English and other pilgrims in
   Frankfort-on-the Main, he accepted the invitation to his native country
   in 1556, and was made General Superintendent of Little Poland. Here he
   prepared, with the aid of other scholars, an admirable Polish
   translation of the Scriptures, published after his death, organized
   Reformed Churches (which increased in his time to the number of one
   hundred and twenty-two), and confirmed the union of the Calvinists with
   the Bohemian Brethren, although he himself preferred the Presbyterian
   polity with lay representation to the Bohemian episcopacy, and differed
   from their view of the Lord's Supper and other articles of their
   confession. He died Jan. 7, 1560, in the midst of work and care. [1116]

   PETER PAUL VERGERIO. [1117]

   During the same period Poland was twice visited (1557 and 1559) by
   another remarkable man among the secondary reformers-- Peter Paul
   Vergerio (1498-1565), formerly papal nuncio to Germany and Bishop of
   Capo d'Istria. [1118] In the attempt to refute the Lutheran writings he
   had become a Protestant, introduced the Reformation in the Italian
   parts of the Grisons (Valtellina, Poschiavo, and Bregaglia), and then
   took up his residence in Tübingen under the protection of Duke
   Christopher of Würtemberg, writing many books and making important
   missionary journeys. He was well received in Poland by Prince Radziwill
   and the king. He associated mainly with Lutherans and the Bohemian
   Brethren, but labored for the cause of union, like Laski. [1119]

   He aided the Reformation by his able pen, and the Roman historian
   Raynaldus says that 'this wretched heretic led many weak Catholics into
   the camp of Satan.' But his stay in Poland was too short to leave
   permanent results.

   THE PAPAL REACTION AND TRIUMPH.

   In the mean time the Roman Catholic party, under the leadership of
   Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, Bishop of Ermeland (d. 1579), was very
   active. Pope Paul IV. sent a nuncio, Lipomani, to Poland, and urged the
   king to banish Laski and Vergerio from the country, and to suppress,
   with every power at his command, the rising heresy, if he would save
   his honor, his crown, and his soul. The weak king vacillated between
   the advice of Calvin and the threats of the Pope, and did nothing. He
   allowed the glorious opportunity to pass, and died in 1572, the last of
   the House of Jagellon. The nobles were likewise undecided, and many of
   them were carried away by the Unitarian heresy which began to spread in
   Poland in 1558.

   During the interregnum which followed the death of Sigmund Augustus,
   the nobles, before electing a new king, concluded in 1573 a patriotic
   treaty of peace for the protection of religious freedom, under the name
   of Pax Dissidentium--that is, of the Roman Catholic and the three
   evangelical Churches. [1120] They required Duke Henry of Anjou, the
   brother of the King of France and a violent enemy of the Huguenots, to
   accept the treaty as a condition of the crown, hoping to break it
   afterwards. On being peremptorily told by the Great Marshal, in the
   midst of the act of coronation, 'Si non jurabis non regnabis' he took
   the oath in spite of the remonstrance of the Romish party; but he left
   Poland in 1574, being called to the throne of France after the death of
   his brother, Charles IX. His Protestant successor, Stephen Bathori of
   Transylvania (1575-86), took the same oath, but afterwards joined the
   Roman Church and opened the door to the Jesuits This was the
   turning-point.

   Under Sigmund III.--a Swedish prince, who had been educated and
   converted by Jesuits, and was elected king in 1587--there began a
   series of vexations and oppressions of the Protestants which gradually
   reduced them to a poor remnant, except in the Prussian part of Poland
   where the German element prevailed. Even Laski's relations and the four
   sons of Radziwill returned to the Roman Church; one of these sons
   became a cardinal; another made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and spent
   five thousand ducats for the purchase and destruction of Polish Bibles
   which his father had published (1563) at his expense. [1121] Hence the
   great scarcity of this work. It was an essential part of the Jesuit
   counter-reformation to burn the whole Protestant literature, and thus,
   to suppress all independent thought. In this it succeeded only too
   well. The Polish nation, after the light of the gospel was
   extinguished, hastened step by step to its internal and external ruin.

   THE CONSENSUS OF SENDOMIR.

   After the death of Laski (1560) and Prince Radziwill (1567) the
   Protestants had no commanding leader, and felt the more the necessity
   of some union for their own safety. An organic union would have been
   the best, and would perhaps have made them strong enough to carry the
   king and the nobles with them. But for such a step they were not
   prepared. Instead of this the Lutherans (influenced by the liberal
   advice of the Melanchthonian divines of Wittenberg), the Calvinists,
   and the Bohemian Brethren effected a confederate union at the Synod of
   Sendomir, [1122] April 14, 1570, and expressed it in the Consensus
   Sendomiriensis, the only important confessional document of the
   evangelical Churches in Poland. It was published by authority, in Latin
   and Polish, in 1586, with a preface signed by Erasmus Gliczner,
   Lutheran Superintendent of Great Poland, in the name of the ministers
   of the Augsburg Confession, by John Laurentius, Superintendent of the
   Bohemian Brethren in Great Poland, and by Paulus Gilovius,
   Superintendent of the Reformed Churches in Little Poland. [1123]

   The Consensus sets forth that the three orthodox evangelical Churches
   are agreed in the doctrines of God, the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation,
   the person of Christ, justification by faith, and other fundamental
   articles, as taught in the Augsburg, the Bohemian, and Helvetic
   Confessions, against papists, sectarians, and all enemies of the
   gospel; that in the unfortunate sacramentarian controversy they adopt
   that explanation of the words of institution which distinguishes (with
   Irenæus) between the earthly form and the heavenly substance in the
   Lord's Supper, and regards the visible elements not as mere signs, but
   as conveying to the believer truly through faith that which they
   represent. [1124]

   Then follows a long extract on the sacraments from the Repetition of
   the Augsburg Confession, or Saxon Confession, which Melanchthon
   prepared in 1551 for the Council of Trent.

   The Consensus thus adopts the later Melanchthonian or Calvinistic
   theory; it avoids the characteristic Lutheran terms (manducatio oralis,
   etc.), and demands faith as the medium of receiving the matter
   represented by the elements. The doctrine of predestination was not
   touched, as there seems to have been no controversy about it.

   In conclusion the Consensus acknowledges the orthodoxy and Christian
   character of the three parties, and pledges them to cultivate peace and
   charity, and to avoid strife and dissension, which greatly hinder the
   progress of the gospel. They should seal this compact by exchange of
   pulpits and of delegates to general synods, and by frequent sacramental
   intercommunion; each denomination retaining its peculiarities in
   worship and discipline which (according to the Augsburg and the Saxon
   Confessions) are consistent with the unity of the Church.

   Then follow the signatures of noblemen and ministers.

   Great joy was felt at this happy result, and was expressed by mutual
   congratulations and united praise of God.

   A few weeks afterwards, May 20, 1570, a synodical meeting was held at
   Posen in the same spirit of union, and twenty brief supplementary
   articles were adopted for the purpose of confirming and preserving the
   Consensus. [1125] One of the articles forbids polemics in the pulpit.
   When the people, who stood outside of the house where the meeting was
   held, heard the happy conclusion, they joined in the singing of the Te
   Deum, with tears of joy and gratitude to God. The union was sealed on
   the following Sunday by two united services in the Lutheran church and
   in the Bohemian chapel.

   The Consensus was again confirmed by the general synods at Cracow,
   1573; Petricow, 1578; Vladislav, 1583; and Thorn, 1595. The last was
   the largest synod ever held in Poland. [1126]

   The Lutherans who adhered to the Formula of Concord (1580) withdrew
   from the Consensus. But the spirit of union which produced it passed
   into the three Brandenburg Confessions of the seventeenth century, and
   revived in the Evangelical Union of Prussia. [1127]

   Hungary, an extensive and fertile country on the banks of the lower
   Danube, once an independent kingdom, then united with the empire of
   Austria, and containing a mixed population of Magyars, Germans,
   Slowaks, Ruthenians, Croats, Serbs, etc., received the first seeds of
   the Christian religion from Constantinople; but the real apostle of the
   Hungarians was Stephen I. (979-1038), a king and a saint, who by
   persuasion and violence overthrew heathenism and barbarism, gave rich
   endowments to the churches and clergy, and brought his country into
   close contact with the Roman Church and the German Empire.

   THE REFORMATION.

   The way for the Reformation was prepared by Waldenses and Bohemian
   Brethren who sought refuge in Hungary from persecution. The writings of
   Luther found ready access among the German population, and were read
   with avidity, especially the one on the Babylonian Captivity of the
   Church. Many young Hungarians, among them Matthias Dévay (De Vay),
   called 'the Hungarian Luther,' [1128] and Leonard Stöckel, studied at
   Wittenberg; others, as John Honter, at Basle; and on their return they
   introduced the new doctrines at Ofen, Cronstadt, and other cities,
   without any compulsion or aid from the government. It was a spontaneous
   movement of the people. Even some bishops and other dignitaries of the
   Roman Church became Protestants from conviction.

   In 1545 a meeting of twenty-nine ministers at Erdöd adopted a creed of
   twelve articles in essential agreement with the Augsburg Confession.
   Another Lutheran synod at Medwisch (Medias), in 1548, drew up the
   Confessio Pentapolitana, which represented five free cities in Upper
   Hungary, and was declared legal in 1555. The Saxon or German population
   of Hungary and Transylvania remained mostly Lutheran.

   On the other hand, the majority of the Magyars or Hungarians proper
   (the ruling race in that country) were more influenced by the Latin
   writings of Melanchthon and Calvin than by the German of Luther, and
   during the violent eucharistic controversies in Germany embraced the
   Calvinistic creed, which they formally adopted at the Synod of Czenger,
   1557, and which they nominally profess to this day. [1129] A large
   number of Magyar pastors left the Lutheran Confession and embraced
   Calvinism in 1563. The Presbyterian polity and discipline were
   introduced by the Synods of Tarczal, Göntz, and Debreczin. Thus the
   separation of the two evangelical Churches was completed.

   Protestantism made rapid progress under Maximilian II. At the close of
   the sixteenth century the larger part of the people and the whole
   nobility, with the exception of three magnates, had accepted the
   Reformation. It gave a vigorous impulse to national life and literary
   activity. 'It is astonishing to see the amount of religious information
   which was then spread among the citizens and the lower classes, and the
   fertility of the press in places where now not even an almanac is
   printed.' [1130]

   But under the reign of Rudolph II., King of Hungary from 1572 to 1608,
   began the counter-reformation of the Jesuits (among whom Peter Pázmány,
   a nobleman of Calvinistic parents, was the most successful in making
   converts), and a series of cruel persecutions by the Hapsburg rulers,
   urged on by the Popes, which continued for nearly two centuries, amid
   reactions, rebellions, civil wars, and wars with the Turks. A
   Jesuitical formula for the conversion of Hungarian Protestants
   pronounces awful curses on the evangelical faith, with the promise to
   persecute it by the sword. Whether genuine or not, it shows the intense
   bitterness of the conflict. [1131] General Caraffa, a cruel papist,
   erected in the market-place at Eperjes a bloody scaffold, or
   'slaughter-bank,' where for several months daily tortures and
   executions by fire and sword took place (1657). [1132]

   Protestantism survived these trials. Joseph II., by his famous Edict of
   Toleration, Oct. 29, 1781, secured to the followers of the Augsburg and
   Helvetic Confessions liberty of conscience and public worship. His
   brother and successor, Leopold, confirmed it in 1791. The remaining
   restrictions were removed in 1848. The present number of Protestants in
   Hungary is about three millions, or one fifth of the whole population
   (which in 1869 amounted to fifteen millions and a half). The Lutheran
   Confession prevails among the German population; the followers of the
   Reformed or Helvetic Confession are twice as numerous, and are mostly
   Magyars.

   THE HUNGARIAN CONFESSION.

   The Hungarian Confession, or Confessio Czengerina, was prepared and
   adopted at a Reformed Synod held at Czenger in 1557 or 1558, [1133] and
   printed in 1570 at Debreczin. [1134]

   It treats, in brief articles or propositions, of the Triune God, of
   Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Scripture designations of the Holy
   Spirit, the rules for explaining the phrases concerning God, the law
   and the gospel, the rights and sacraments of the Church, Christian
   liberty, election, the cause of sin, and the only mediator Jesus
   Christ. It is preceded by a strong Biblical argument against the
   anti-Trinitarians and Socinians, who had spread in Transylvania. It
   vehemently rejects the Romish transubstantiation and the Lutheran
   'sarcophagia,' [1135] but also the 'sacramentarian' view of a purely
   symbolical presence, and teaches that Christ is truly though
   spiritually present, and communicates himself in the Lord's Supper as
   the living bread and the celestial drink, with all his gifts, to the
   believer. [1136] It defends infant baptism against the Anabaptists. It
   teaches a free election, but is silent about reprobation, and denies
   that God is the author of sin. Later synods professed more clearly the
   doctrine of predestination and the perseverance of saints.

   This Confession presents some original and vigorous features, but has
   only a secondary historical importance. It was practically superseded
   by the Second Helvetic Confession of 1566, which is far superior, and
   was subscribed by the entire Reformed clergy of Hungary convened at
   Debreczin in 1567. The Heidelberg Catechism was also introduced.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1128] Dévay lived in the home of Luther, who calls him 'vir honestus,
   gravis et eruditus.' He sympathized, however, with Melanchthon in the
   eucharistic controversy, and inclined to the Calvinistic view, so as to
   cause complaint on the part of the strict Lutherans in Hungary (1544).
   See Luther's Letters, Vol. V. p. 644 (ed. De Wette), and Henke, p. 355.

   [1129] We say nominally, for both the Reformed and Lutheran Churches of
   Hungary have been much affected by rationalism. This applies, however,
   to nearly all the State Churches of the Continent.

   [1131] See above, p. 92, note 2.

   [1132] Sismondi and Merle d'Aubigné (l.c. p. ix.) state that the
   persecutions of the Hungarian Protestants surpassed in cruelty the
   persecutions of the Huguenots under Louis XIV.

   [1133] The date is uncertain.

   [1134] Debreczin is a royal free city in the northeastern part of the
   Hungarian Lowland, with about fifty thousand inhabitants, and contains
   the principal Calvinistic college of the kingdom. In 1849 it was the
   seat of the revolutionary government of Kossuth, and the independence
   of Hungary was there declared in the Reformed Church.

   sanguinolentum, sine ulla mutatione et
   transsubstantiatione.'--Niemeyer, pp. 544 sq. The severe judgment of
   the Lutheran doctrine was a retaliation for the condemnation of Zwingli
   and Calvin as sacramentarians by a Lutheran Synod of Hermanstadt.

   period.


   The last and, in its final results, the most important chapter in the
   history of the reformation was acted in that remarkable island which
   has become the chief stronghold of Protestantism in Europe, the ruler
   of the waves, and the pioneer of modern Christian civilization and
   constitutional liberty. The Anglo-Saxon race is intrusted by Providence
   with the sceptre of empire in its eastward and westward coarse. The
   defeat of the Armada was that turning-point in history when the
   dominion in which the sun never sets passed from Roman Catholic Spain
   to Protestant England.

   The Reformation in Britain, favored by insular independence, was a
   national political as well as ecclesiastical movement, and carried with
   it Church and State, rulers and subjects; while on the Continent it
   encountered a powerful opposition and Jesuitical reaction. It began
   with outward changes, and was controlled by princes, bishops, and
   statesmen rather than by scholars and divines; while in other countries
   the reform proceeded from the inner life of religion and the profound
   study of the Scriptures. Good and bad men, from pure and low motives,
   took part in the work, but were overruled by a higher power for a noble
   end. [1137] England produced no reformers of such towering genius,
   learning, and heroism as Luther and Calvin, but a large number of
   learned and able prelates and statesmen, and a noble army of martyrs
   worthily led by Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Hooper, and Rogers. It
   displayed less theological depth and originality than Germany and
   Switzerland, where the ideas and principles of the Reformation were
   wrought out, but a greater power of practical organization. It gave the
   new ideas a larger field of action and application to all the
   ramifications of society and all departments of literature, which
   entered upon its golden age in the reign of Elizabeth, and which, in
   wealth of genius and in veneration for the truths of Christianity, far
   surpassed that of any other nation. [1138] Although at first despotic
   and intolerant, English Protestantism by its subsequent development
   became the guardian of civil and religious liberty. The fierce struggle
   between 'the old and new learning' lasted for more than a century, and
   passed through a baptism of blood which purified and fertilized the
   soil of England and became the seed of new colonies and empires beyond
   the sea.

   The British Reformation is full of romantic interest, and developed a
   great variety of strongly marked characters, who still excite the
   passions, prejudices, and contradictory judgments of writers and
   readers. It is a succession of tragedies; it abounds in actions and
   reactions, in crimes and punishments, in changes of fortune, in men and
   women elevated to the pinnacle of power and happiness and hurled to the
   abyss of disgrace and misfortune. It furnishes a striking illustration
   of the truth that the history of the Church, as well as of the world,
   is a judgment of the Church. This idea of righteous retribution imparts
   a thrilling moral effect to the tragedies of Shakspere, who lived at
   the close of these shifting scenes, and gathered from them his
   marvelous knowledge of human nature, in all its phases and conditions,
   such as no poet ancient or modern ever possessed.

   The richest fruit of the British Reformation is the translation of the
   Bible--the work of three generations, the best ever made, and to this
   day the chief nursery of piety among the Protestant denominations of
   the English-speaking race; and next to it that noble responsive liturgy
   which animates and regulates the devotions of the Episcopal communion
   on land and sea. These two works are truly national institutions, and
   command a veneration and affection above all other books, not only by
   their sacred contents, but also by their classical diction, which
   sounds in the ear like solemn music from a higher and better world.

   EPOCHS OF THE ENGLISH REFORMATION.

   The history of the English Reformation naturally divides itself into
   four periods:

   1. From 1527 to 1547. The abolition of the authority of the Roman See
   over England and the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. This
   was chiefly a destructive process and a political change of the supreme
   governing power of the Church, prompted by unworthy personal motives,
   but it prepared the way for the religious reformation under the
   following reign. The despotic and licentious monarch, whom Leo X.
   rewarded for his book against Luther with the title 'Defender of the
   Faith,' remained a Catholic in belief and sentiment till his death; he
   merely substituted king-worship for pope-worship, a domestic tyranny
   for a foreign one, by cutting off the papal tiara from the episcopal
   hierarchy and placing his own crown on the bleeding neck; but he could
   not have effected so great a revolution without the sanction of
   Parliament and a strong clerical and popular current towards
   ecclesiastical independence and reform, which showed itself even before
   his breach with Rome, and became dominant under his successor.

   2. From 1547 to 1553. The introduction of the Reformation in doctrine
   and worship under Edward VI., Henry's only son, and the commencing
   conflict between the semi-Catholic and the Puritan tendencies. The
   ruling genius of this period was Archbishop Cranmer, the Melanchthon of
   England, who by cautious trimming and facile subservience to Henry had
   saved the cause of the Reformation through the trials of a despotic
   reign for better times.

   3. From 1553 to 1558. The papal reaction under Henry's oldest daughter,
   Mary Tudor, that 'unhappiest of queens and wives and women.' [1139] She
   had more Spanish than English blood in her veins, and revenged the
   injustice done to her mother, Catharine of Aragon. Her short but bloody
   reign was the period of Protestant martyrdom, which fertilized the soil
   of England, and of the exile of about eight hundred Englishmen, who
   were received with open arms on the Continent, and who brought back
   clearer and stronger views of the Reformation. The violent restoration
   of the old system intensified the hatred of Popery, and forever
   connected it in the English mind with persecution and bloodshed, with
   national humiliation and disgrace. 'The tale of Protestant sufferings
   was told with wonderful pathos and picturesqueness by John Foxe, an
   exile during the persecution, and his "Book of Martyrs," which was
   (under the following reign) set up by royal order in the churches for
   public reading, passed from the churches to the shelves of every
   English household.'

   4. From 1558 to 1603. The permanent establishment of the Reformed
   Church of England in opposition both to Roman Catholic and to Puritan
   dissent during the long, brilliant, and successful reign of Queen
   Elizabeth.

   This masculine woman, the last and the greatest of the Tudors,
   inherited the virtues and vices of her Catholic father (Henry VIII.)
   and her Protestant mother (Anne Boleyn). [1140] She was endowed with
   rare gifts by nature, and favored with, the best education; she was
   brave and bold, yet prudent and cautious; fond of show, jewelry and
   dress, yet parsimonious and mean; coldly intellectual, high-tempered,
   capricious, haughty, selfish, and vain, and well versed in the low arts
   of intrigue and dissimulation. She trusted more in time and her good
   fortune than in Almighty God. She was destitute of religious
   enthusiasm, and managed the Church question from a purely political
   point of view. She dropped the blasphemous title 'Head of the Church of
   England,' and was content to be the supreme 'Governor' of the same.
   [1141] But with this limitation the royal supremacy was the chief
   article in her creed, and she made her bishops feel her power. 'Proud
   prelate,' she wrote to the Bishop of Ely, when he resisted the
   spoliation of his see in favor of one of her favorites, 'you know what
   you were before I made you what you are! If you do not immediately
   comply with my request, by God! I will unfrock you.' As a matter of
   taste she liked crucifixes, images, and the gorgeous display of the
   Roman hierarchy and ritual; and, being proud of her own virginity, she
   disliked the marriage of the clergy; she insulted the worthy wife of
   Archbishop Parker by refusing to call her 'Madam,' the usual address to
   married ladies. But she had the sagacity to perceive that her true
   interests were identified with the cause of Protestantism, and she
   maintained it with a strong arm, aided by the ablest council and the
   national sentiment, against the excommunication of the Pope, the
   assaults of Spain, and the intrigues of the Jesuits at home. This is
   the basis of the popularity which she enjoyed as a ruler with all
   classes of her subjects except the Romanists.

   Her ecclesiastical policy at home was a system of compromise in the
   interest of outward uniformity. It was fortified by a penal code which
   may be explained though not justified by the political necessities and
   the general intolerance of the times, but which was nevertheless cruel
   and abominable, and has been gradually swept away by the progress of a
   nobler and more enlightened policy of religious liberty.

   As in the case of her predecessors, we should remember that the policy
   of Elizabeth was merely the outward frame which surrounds the true
   inward history of the religious movement of her age. The doctrinal
   reformation with which we are concerned was begun in the second and
   completed in the fourth period.

   With the reign of Elizabeth ended the great conflict with Rome. It was
   followed by the internal conflict between Puritanism and Episcopacy,
   which, after a temporary triumph of the former under Cromwell, resulted
   in the re-establishment of the Episcopal Church and the expulsion of
   Puritanism (1662), until another revolution (1688) brought on the final
   downfall of the treacherous Stuarts and the toleration of the
   Dissenters, who thereafter represented, in separate organizations, the
   left or radical wing of English Protestantism.

   [1137] Robert Southey (Life of Wesley, Vol. I. p. 266, Harpers'
   edition) says: 'In England the best people and the worst combined in
   bringing about the Reformation, and in its progress it bore evident
   marks of both.'

   [1138] Fisher (The Reformation, p. 533): 'The boldness and independence
   of the Elizabethan writers, their fearless and earnest pursuit of
   truth, and their solemn sense of religion, apart from all asceticism
   and superstition, are among the effects of the Reformation. This is
   equally true of them as it is of Milton and of the greatest of their
   successors. Nothing save the impulse which Protestantism gave to the
   English mind, and the intellectual ferment which was engendered by it,
   will account for the literary phenomena of the Elizabethan times.' Even
   that brilliant and racy French critic, Taine, must acknowledge the
   constant influence of 'the grave and grand idea of religion, of faith
   and prayer,' upon such writers as Bacon, Raleigh, Burton, and Sir
   Thomas Browne.

   historian of England, J. R. Green, A Short History of the English
   People (London, 1875), pp. 362-370.

   [1141] Parliament, in the act of supremacy (1534), declared King Henry,
   his heirs and successors, to be 'the only supreme head, on earth, of
   the Church of England, called the Anglicana Ecclesia.' For denying this
   royal supremacy in spiritual matters, More and Fisher suffered
   martyrdom. The thirty-seventh of the Elizabethan Articles modifies it
   considerably, but still claims for 'the Queen's Majesty the chief power
   in this Realm of England, . . . unto whom the chief government of all
   estates, whether they be ecclesiastical or civil, in all causes doth
   appertain,' etc. Elizabeth disclaimed the sacerdotal character which
   her father had assumed, but retained and exercised the vast power of
   appointing her prelates, summoning and dissolving convocations,
   sanctioning creeds and canons, and punishing heresies and all manner of
   abuses with the civil sword.

   § 77. The Doctrinal Position of the Anglican Church and her Relation to
   other Churches.

   The Reformed Church of England occupies an independent position between
   Romanism on the one hand, and Lutheranism and Calvinism on the other,
   with strong affinities and antagonisms in both directions. She nursed
   at her breasts Calvinistic Puritans, Arminian Methodists, liberal
   Latitudinarians, and Romanizing Tractarians and Ritualists. This
   comprehensiveness of the Church as a whole is quite consistent with the
   narrowness and exclusiveness of particular parties. It repels and
   attracts; it caused the large secessions which occurred at critical
   junctures in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, but
   it also explains the individual accessions which she continually though
   quietly receives from other Churches.

   The English mind is not theorizing and speculative, but eminently
   practical and conservative; it follows more the power of habit than the
   logic of thought; it takes things as they are, makes haste slowly,
   mends abuses cautiously, and aims at the attainable rather than the
   ideal. The Reformation in England was less controlled by theology than
   on the Continent, and more complicated with ecclesiastical and
   political issues. Anglican theology is as much embodied in the
   episcopal polity and the liturgical worship as in the doctrinal
   standards. The Book of Common Prayer is catholic, though purged of
   superstitious elements; the Articles of Religion are evangelical and
   moderately Calvinistic. [1142] The hierarchical, sacerdotal, and
   sacramental systems of religion are congenial and logically
   inseparable; they moderate and check the Protestant tendency, and if
   unduly pressed they become Romanizing. In great minds we often find
   great antagonisms or opposite truths dwelling together unreconciled;
   while partisans look only at one side. Augustine, Luther, and even the
   more logical Calvin, believed in divine sovereignty and human
   responsibility, free election and sacramental grace, and combined
   reverence for Church authority with independence of private judgment.
   The English Church leaves room for catholic and evangelical, mediæval
   and modern ideas, without an attempt to harmonize them; but her parties
   are one-sided, and differ as widely as separate denominations, though
   subject to the same bishop and worshiping at the same altar. She is
   composite and eclectic in her character, like the English language; she
   has more outward uniformity than inward unity; she is fixed in her
   organic structure, but elastic in doctrinal opinion, and has
   successively allowed opposite schools of theology to grow up which
   claim to be equally loyal to her genius and institutions. She has lost
   in England by those periodical separations which followed her great
   religious movements (the Puritan, the Methodist, the Anglo-Catholic)
   nearly one half of the nation she once exclusively controlled; yet she
   remains to this day the richest and strongest national Church in
   Protestant Christendom, and exercises more power over England than
   Lutheranism does over Germany or Calvinism over Switzerland and
   Holland. In the United States the Protestant Episcopal Church is
   numerically much smaller than most of the denominations which in
   England were cast out or voluntarily went out from the established
   Church as Non-conformists and Dissenters; but she will always occupy a
   commanding position among the higher classes and in large cities,
   because she represents the noble institutions and literature of the
   aristocratic, conservative, and venerable Church of England.

   THE MELANCHTHONIAN INFLUENCE.

   Germany received Roman Catholic Christianity from England through
   Winfrid or Boniface, and in turn gave to England the first impulse of
   the evangelical Reformation. The writings of Luther were read with
   avidity by students in Oxford and Cambridge as early as 1527. Cranmer
   spent some time in Germany, and was connected with it by domestic ties.
   [1143] Henry VIII. never overcame his intense dislike of Luther,
   kindled by their unfortunate controversy on the seven sacraments, and
   strengthened by Luther's breach with Erasmus; but he respected
   Melanchthon for his learning and wisdom, and invited him to assist in
   reforming the English Church. [1144] He entered into negotiations with
   the Wittenberg divines and the Lutheran princes of the Smalcald League,
   but chiefly from political motives and without effect.

   Under Edward VI. the influence of the Melanchthonian theology, as
   embodied in the Augsburg Confession (1530) and the Suabian Confession
   (1552), became more apparent, and can be clearly traced in Cranmer's
   earlier writings, in some of the Articles of Religion, and in those
   parts of the Book of Common Prayer which were borrowed from the
   'Consultation' of Archbishop Hermann of Cologne, compiled by Bucer and
   Melanchthon (1543). Hence the English Church has been called sometimes
   by Lutheran divines an Ecclesia Lutheranizans.

   But the peculiar views of Luther on the real presence and the ubiquity
   of Christ's body found no congenial soil in England. Cranmer himself
   abandoned them as early as Dec. 14, 1548, when a public discussion was
   held in London on the eucharist; and he adopted, together with Ridley,
   the Calvinistic doctrine of a virtual presence and communication of
   Christ's glorified humanity. He held that 'Christ is figuratively in
   the bread and wine, and spiritually in them that worthily eat the bread
   and drink the wine; but, on the other hand, contended that our blessed
   Lord is really, carnally, and corporally in heaven alone, from whence
   he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.' [1145] This doctrinal
   change was embodied (1552) in the revision of the first Prayer-Book of
   Edward VI.; the prayer of oblation was converted into a thanksgiving,
   and the old formula of distribution, which was compatible even with a
   belief in transubstantiation ('The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ,'
   etc.), was replaced by another which a Zwinglian may approve ('Take and
   eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee,' etc.). In the
   Elizabethan Service-Book the two formulas were combined (the second
   being an explanation of the first), and have ever since continued in
   use.

   In the violent controversies which agitated Germany after Luther's
   death, and which led to the Formula of Concord, England sided with the
   milder Melanchthonian school. Queen Elizabeth made an effort to prevent
   the adoption of the Formula and the condemnation of the Reformed
   doctrines. [1146]

   THE ZWINGLIAN AND CALVINISTIC INFLUENCE.

   The doctrines of Zurich and Geneva began to spread in England under the
   reign of Edward VI. Calvin, whose books were prohibited by Henry VIII.
   (in 1542), corresponded freely with the Duke of Somerset (Oct. 22,
   1548), Edward VI., and Cranmer, and urged a more thorough reformation
   of doctrine and discipline, and a better education of the clergy, but
   left episcopacy untouched, which he was willing to tolerate in England
   as well as in the kingdom of Poland. [1147] His controversy with
   Pighius about predestination excited considerable sympathy in England
   (1552), and his doctrine of the eucharist gained ground more rapidly.
   Cranmer called to his aid prominent Reformed and Unionistic divines,
   such as Peter Martyr, Ochino, Laski, Bucer, and Fagius, and gave them
   high positions in Oxford, Cambridge, and London. It is characteristic
   of his catholicity of spirit that in 1548 he conceived the plan of
   inviting Melanchthon of Wittenberg, Bullinger of Zurich, Calvin of
   Geneva, Bucer of Strasburg, Peter Martyr, Laski, and others to Lambeth
   for the purpose of drawing up a union creed for all evangelical
   Churches. [1148] John Hooper, who had resided two years at Zurich, was
   made Bishop of Gloucester (1551), although he went even beyond
   Bullinger and Calvin in matters of clerical vestments and ceremonies,
   and may be called a forerunner of Puritanism. He died heroically for
   his faith under Mary (1555). John Knox was elected one of the chaplains
   of Edward VI., and was offered the bishopric of Rochester, which he
   declined. He exerted considerable influence, and would no doubt have
   retained it under Elizabeth, had he not (together with his teacher and
   friend, Calvin) incurred her personal dislike by his trumpet-blast
   'against the monstrous regimen of women,' which was provoked by the
   fatal misgovernment of her sister. [1149]

   Under the reign of Mary the English exiles formed the closest ties of
   personal and theological friendship with the Reformers of Switzerland,
   and on their return under Queen Elizabeth they took the lead in the
   restoration and reconstruction of the Reformed Church of England.
   Bishop Jewel, the final reviser of the Thirty-nine Articles, wrote to
   Peter Martyr at Zurich (Feb. 7, 1562): 'As to matters of doctrine, we
   have pared every thing away to the very quick, and do not differ from
   you by a nail's breadth; for as to the ubiquitarian [i.e., the
   Lutheran] theory there is no danger in this country. Opinions of that
   kind can only gain admittance where the stones have sense.' [1150]

   Bullinger's 'Decades' were for some time the manual of the clergy.
   Afterwards Calvin's 'Institutes' became the text-book of theology in
   Oxford and Cambridge. [1151] Even his Catechism was ordered to be used
   by statute in the universities (1587). Next to him his friend and
   successor, Beza, was for many years the highest theological authority.
   The University of Cambridge, in thanking him for the valuable gift of
   Codex D of the New Testament, in 1581, acknowledges its preference for
   him and John Calvin above any men that ever lived since the days of the
   Apostles. [1152] Beza's editions of the Greek Testament, his elegant
   Latin translation, and exegetical notes were in general use in England
   during the reigns of Elizabeth and James, and were made the chief basis
   not only of the Geneva Bible (1560), but also of the revision of the
   Bishops' Bible under King James (1611). [1153]

   It is not too much to say that the ruling theology of the Church of
   England in the latter half of the sixteenth and the beginning of the
   seventeenth century was Calvinistic. [1154] The best proof of this is
   furnished by the 'Zurich Letters,' [1155] extending over the whole
   period of the Reformation, the Elizabethan Articles, the Second Book of
   Homilies (chiefly composed by Bishop Jewel), the Lambeth Articles, the
   Irish Articles, and the report of the delegation of King James to the
   Calvinistic Synod of Dort. [1156]

   EPISCOPACY.

   This theological sympathy between the English and the Continental
   Churches extended also to the principles of Church government, which
   was regarded as a matter of secondary importance, and subject to
   change, like rites and ceremonies, 'according to the diversities of
   countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained
   against God's Word' (Art. XXXIV.). The difference was simply this: the
   English Reformers, being themselves bishops, retained episcopacy as an
   ancient institution of the Church catholic, but fully admitted (with
   the most learned fathers and schoolmen, sustained by modern
   commentators and historians) the original identity of the offices of
   bishop and presbyter; while the German and Swiss Reformers, being only
   presbyters or laymen, and opposed by their bishops, fell back from
   necessity rather than choice upon the parity of ministers, without
   thereby denying the human right and relative importance or expediency
   of episcopacy as a superintendency over equals in rank. The more rigid
   among the Puritans departed from both by attaching primary importance
   to matters of discipline and ritual, and denouncing every form of
   government and public worship that was not expressly sanctioned in the
   New Testament.

   The most learned English divines before the period of the Restoration,
   such as Cranmer, Jewel, Hooker, Field, Ussher, Hall, and Stillingfleet,
   did not hold the theory of an exclusive jure divino episcopacy, and
   fully recognized the validity of presbyterian ordination. They
   preferred and defended episcopacy as the most ancient and general form
   of government, best adapted for the maintenance of order and unity; in
   one word, as necessary for the well-being, but not for the being of the
   Church. Cranmer invited the co-operation of Lutherans and Calvinists
   even in the most important work of framing the Articles of Religion and
   revising the Liturgy, without questioning their ordination; his own
   views of episcopacy were so low that he declared 'election or
   appointment thereto sufficient' without consecration, and he was so
   thoroughly Erastian that after the death of Henry he and his suffragans
   took out fresh commissions from the new king. [1157] His three
   successors in the primacy (Parker, Grindal, and Whitgift) did not
   differ from him in principle. 'Archbishop Grindal,' says Macaulay,
   'long hesitated about accepting a mitre, from dislike of what he
   regarded as the mummery of consecration. Bishop Parkhurst uttered a
   fervent prayer that the Church of England would propose to herself the
   Church of Zurich as the absolute pattern of a Christian community.
   Bishop Ponet was of opinion that the word bishop should be abandoned to
   the Papists, and that the chief officers of the purified Church should
   be called superintendents.' The nineteenth of the Elizabethan Articles,
   which treats of the visible Church, says nothing of episcopacy as a
   mark of the Church. The statute of the thirteenth year of Elizabeth,
   cap. 12, permits ministers of the Scotch and other foreign Churches to
   exercise their ministry in England without re-ordination. After the
   union with Scotland the English sovereign represented in his official
   character the national Churches of the two countries, and when in
   Scotland, Queen Victoria takes the communion from the hands of a
   Presbyterian parson. Prominent clergymen of the Church of England, such
   as Travers (Provost of Trinity College, Dublin), Whittingham (Dean of
   Durham), Cartwright (Professor of Divinity in Cambridge, afterwards
   Master of Warwick Hospital), and John Morrison (from Scotland), had
   received only Presbyterian ordination in foreign Churches. Similar
   instances of Scotch, French, and Dutch Reformed ministers who were
   received simply on subscribing the Articles occurred down to the civil
   war. The English delegates to the Synod of Dort, which was presided
   over by a presbyter, were high dignitaries and doctors of divinity, one
   of them (Carleton) a bishop, and two others (Davenant and Hall) were
   afterwards raised to bishoprics. Archbishop Ussher, the greatest
   English divine of his age, who in eighteen years had mastered the whole
   mass of patristic literature, defended episcopacy only as a presidency
   of one presbyter over his peers, and declared that when abroad he would
   take the holy communion from a Dutch Reformed or French minister as
   readily as from an Episcopalian clergyman at home.

   But the reigns of James and Charles I. form the transition. In the heat
   of the Puritan controversy both parties took extreme ground,
   Presbyterians and Independents as well as Episcopalians, and claimed
   exclusive Scripture authority and divine right for their form of
   government. Truth and error were mixed on both sides; for the primitive
   government was neither Episcopalian nor Presbyterian nor Independent,
   but apostolic; and the Apostles, as inspired and infallible teachers
   and rulers of the whole Church of all ages, have and can have no
   successors, as Christ himself can have none.

   The doctrine of the divine and exclusive right of episcopacy was first
   intimated, in self-defense, by Bishop Bancroft, of London (in a sermon,
   1589), then taught and rigidly enforced by Archbishop Laud (1633-1645),
   the most un-Protestant of English prelates, [1158] and was apparently
   sanctioned in 1662 by the Act of Uniformity, which forbade any person
   to hold a benefice or to administer the sacraments before he be
   ordained a priest by Episcopal ordination. By this cruel Act two
   thousand ministers, including some of the ablest and most worthy men in
   England, were expelled from office and driven into non-conformity.

   Notwithstanding this change, the Church of England has never officially
   and expressly pronounced on the validity or invalidity of non-episcopal
   orders in other Churches; she only maintains that no one shall
   officiate in her pulpits and at her altars who has not received
   episcopal ordination according to the direction of the Prayer-book.
   [1159]

   RICHARD HOOKER.

   The truest representative of the conservative and comprehensive genius
   of Anglicanism in doctrine and polity, towards the close of the
   Elizabethan period, is the 'judicious Hooker' (1553-1600), who to this
   day retains the respect of all parties. In his great work on the 'Laws
   of Ecclesiastical Polity' he went to the root of the rising controversy
   between Episcopacy and Puritanism, by representing the Church as a
   legislative body which had the power to make and unmake institutions
   and rites not affecting the doctrines of salvation laid down in the
   Scriptures and oecumenical creeds.

   He defends episcopacy, but without invalidating other forms of
   government, or unchurching other Churches. He highly commends Calvin's
   'Institutes' and 'Commentaries,' and calls him 'incomparably the wisest
   man that ever the French Church did enjoy.' [1160] He generally agrees
   with his theology, at least as far as it is Augustinian, and he clearly
   adopts his view of the eucharist--namely, as he expresses it, that
   'Christ is, personally present, albeit a part of Christ be corporally
   absent,' and 'that the real presence is not to be sought for in the
   sacrament (i.e., in the elements), but in the worthy receiver of the
   sacrament.' But he keeps clear of the logical sharpness and rigor of
   Calvinism, and subjects it to the higher test of the fathers and the
   early Church. [1161]

   His respect for antiquity and his churchly conservatism gained ground
   after his death in the conflict with Puritanism; and when the Synod of
   Dort narrowed the Calvinism of the Reformation to a five-angular
   scholastic scheme, Arminian doctrines, in connection with High-Church
   principles, spread rapidly in the Church of England. She became, as a
   body, more and more exclusive, and broke off the theological
   interchange and fraternal fellowship with non-episcopal Churches. But
   we hope the time is coming when the Christian communion which
   characterized her formative period will be revived under a higher and
   more permanent form.

   Note.--My friend, the Rev. Dr. E. A. Washburn, of New York, an
   Episcopalian divine of rare culture and liberality of spirit, has
   kindly furnished the following contribution to this chapter, which will
   give the reader a broad inside view of Anglicanism under the various
   phases of its historic development:

   'The doctrinal system of the English Church, in its relation to other
   Reformed communions, especially needs a historic treatment; and the
   want of this has led to grave mistakes, alike by Protestant critics and
   Anglo-Catholic defenders. It was one in its positive principles, as
   opposed to the dogmatic falsehoods of Rome, with the great bodies of
   the Continental Reformation; yet it grew as a national Church, while
   those were more fully shaped by the theology of their leaders--Luther,
   Calvin, and Zwingli. This fact is the key of its history. England felt
   the same influences, religious and social, that awakened Europe, but
   its ideas were not borrowed from abroad; it only completed the growth
   begun in the day of Wyclif. Its earliest step was thus a national, one.
   Nor was this, as has been proved by its latest historians from the
   record, the act of Henry VIII.; for before his quarrel the Parliament
   annulled forever, by its own decree, the supremacy of Rome. It could
   not be expected that during his reign the standard of doctrine should
   be greatly changed; and it should be remembered, that Luther himself
   renounced only by degrees the idea of Papal authority. The "Articles
   devised to establish Christian Quietness," probably the original of the
   later Cotton MSS., and the "Institution of a Christian Man" following
   it in 1537, show that the dogma of the mass, the seven sacraments,
   intercessory prayers for the dead, and reverence of the Virgin and
   saints as mediators, remained. It is worth noting, however, that the
   "Erudition" in 1543 gives signs of change, as the "corporal" presence
   is there only the "very body," and the idea of special intercession is
   modified to prayer "for the universal congregation of Christian people,
   quick and dead." But the next reign proves that the act of national
   freedom held in solution the whole result. Ultramontanism meant then,
   as now, not only the feudal headship of Rome, but its scholastic and
   priestly system. The Reformation, ripened in the minds of Cranmer,
   Latimer, Ridley, and other devout thinkers, bore its fruit in the
   revised Liturgy and Articles; nor can any thing be clearer than the
   doctrinal standard of the Church, if we trace it with just historic
   criticism to the time when these were fixed.

   'The Articles ask our first study. It is plain that the
   foundation-truths of the Reformation--justification by faith, the
   supremacy and sufficiency of written Scripture, the fallibility of even
   general councils--are its basis. Yet it is just as plain that in regard
   of the specific points of theology, which were the root of discord in
   the Continental Churches, as election, predestination, reprobation,
   perseverance, and the rest, these Articles speak in a much more
   moderate tone. It is from a narrow study of that age that they have
   been called articles of compromise between a Calvinistic and Arminian
   party. There were some of extreme views, as the Lambeth Articles prove,
   but they did not represent the body. The English Reformers had been
   bred, like the great Genevan, in the school of the greater Augustine;
   and his richer, more ethical spirit appears in not only the Articles,
   but in the writings of well-nigh all from Hooper or Whitgift to Hooker.
   There was the friendliest intercourse between them and the divines of
   the Continent. Melanchthon, Calvin, Bucer were consulted in their
   common work. But the unity of the national Church, not the system of a
   school, was uppermost; and we may write the character of them all in
   the words of the biographer of Field, that "in points of extreme
   difficulty he did not think fit to be so positive in defining as to
   turn matters of opinion into matters of faith."

   'We may thus learn the structure of the liturgical system. The English
   Reformers aimed not to create a new, but to reform the historic Church;
   and therefore they kept the ritual with the episcopate, because they
   were institutions rooted in the soil. They did not unchurch the bodies
   of the Continent, which grew under quite other conditions. No theory of
   an exclusive Anglicanism, as based on the episcopate and general
   councils, was held by them. Such a view is wholly contradictory to
   their own Articles. But the historic character of the Church gave it a
   positive relation to the past; and they sought to adhere to primitive
   usage as the basis of historic unity. In this revision, therefore, they
   weeded out all Romish errors, the mass, the five added sacraments, the
   legends of saints, and superstitious rites; but they kept the ancient
   Apostles' Creed and the Nicene in the forefront of the service, the
   sacramental offices, the festivals and fasts relating to Christ or
   Apostles with whatever they thought pure. Such a work could not be
   perfect, and it is false either to think it so or to judge it save by
   its time. There are archaic forms in these offices which retain some
   ideas of a scholastic theology. The view of regeneration in the
   baptismal service, decried to-day as Romish, can be found by any
   scholar in Melanchthon or in Bullinger's Decades. We may see in some of
   the phrases of the communion office the idea of more than a purely
   spiritual participation, yet the view is almost identical with that of
   Calvin. The dogma of the mass had been renounced, but the Aristotelian
   notions of spirit and body were still embodied in the philosophy of the
   time. The absolution in the office for the sick, and like features,
   have been magnified into "Romanizing germs" on one side and Catholic
   verities on another. The Athanasian Creed, revered by all the
   Reformers, was retained, yet not as that of Nice in the body of the
   worship; and it was wisely excluded by the American revisers, as the
   English Church will by-and-by displace it, because a better criticism
   shows it to be the metaphysical deposit of a later time, un-catholic in
   descent or structure. Such is the rule by which we are to know the
   unity of the English system. The satire, so often repeated since
   Chatham, that the Church has a "Popish Liturgy and Calvinistic
   Articles," is as ignorant as it is unjust. All liturgical formularies
   need revision; but such a task must be judged by the standard of the
   Articles, the whole tenor of the Prayer-book, and the known principles
   of the men. In the same way we learn their view of the Episcopate. Not
   one leading divine from Hooper to Hooker claimed any ground beyond the
   fact of primitive and historic usage; and Whitgift, the typical
   High-Churchman of the Elizabethan time, in reply to the charge of
   Cartwright against prelacy as unscriptural, took the ground that to
   hold it "of necessity to have the same kind of government as in the
   Apostles' time, and expressed in Scripture," is a "rotten pillar." The
   Puritan of that day was as narrow as the narrow Churchman of our own.

   'This historic sketch of the English Reformation explains its whole
   character. It had in it varied elements, but by no means contradictory.
   Had not other influences dwarfed its design, it would have done much to
   harmonize the communions of Protestantism, to blend the new life with a
   sober reverence for the historic past. Lutheranism and Calvinism did
   each its part in the development of a profound theology. The English
   Church had a more comprehensive doctrine and a more conservative order.
   It placed the simple Apostles' Creed above all theological confessions
   as its basis, and a practical system above the subtleties of
   controversy. But its defect lay in the policy which sought uniformity
   instead of a large unity; and the loss of the conscientious men who
   left the national Church gave its ecclesiastical element an undue
   growth. Yet it has retained throughout much of its comprehensiveness.
   It has had many schools of thought, but none has ruled it. Calvinism,
   although shorn of its early strength, has had always adherents, from
   the saintly Leighton to Toplady and Venn. The Arminian doctrine entered
   early from Holland, and in the visit of the divines sent by James to
   the Synod of Dort, among whom were Hall and Davenant, we have the early
   traces of the change. Davenant was nominally against the Remonstrants,
   but the "Suffrages" prove already the milder tone of the English
   theology. It is with Laud that the system gained strong ground, yet it
   never led to such quarrels as in the land of Grotius; it represented
   the growing dislike of a harsh supralapsarianism and the mild spirit of
   scholars like Jeremy Taylor. The criticism has often been made that
   Arminianism is more akin to a High-Church system, because it teaches
   that divine grace is conditioned by works; but if so, perhaps it shows,
   as in the case of Jansenism, that a metaphysical creed, in losing sight
   of the moral side of its own truth, will always drive men to its
   opposite. The English theology of the next period has the like variety.
   It had its divines of rich learning--Bramhall, Cosin, and
   others--inclined to a stricter view of the sacraments and ministry than
   the Reformers; yet it is mere exaggeration to call them the
   Anglo-Catholic fathers, as if they were the exponents of the whole
   Church. They belong to one school of their time. Nor is it a less
   mistake to judge from their opposition, as members of the national
   Church, to the Dissenters, that they unchurched the Continental
   Protestants. Bramhall held an episcopate to be of the Ecclesia integra,
   not vera; and Morton, while bitter towards the Presbyterians, is "not
   so uncharitable" towards foreign Reformed bodies "as to censure them
   for no Churches, for that which is their infelicity, not their fault."
   Chillingworth and Hales are leaders in this period of a more liberal
   thought. The Cambridge school, which a modern critic calls the herald
   of broad Churchmanship, begins here with Smith and Whichcote. The
   theology of England passed into a still more comprehensive growth. Its
   larger conflict with Deism took it out of the guerrilla war of the past
   into the field of Biblical criticism, Christian evidence, and history.
   No party wholly represents it. Such different minds as Tillotson and
   Waterland, Cudworth and Paley, Arnold and Keble have been of the same
   communion. Its successive movements have stirred, yet not rent it. The
   Methodist revival came from the Arminian Wesley, and the wave of
   spiritual life left its true influence, although a cold establishment
   policy ignored it. The evangelical movement was Calvinistic, yet it was
   mainly the protest of devout men like Wilberforce against formalism,
   and did little for theological growth. Our time has been busy with the
   Oxford divinity, which has sought to build a theory of
   Anglo-Catholicism on the basis of an exclusive episcopal succession, a
   Nicene authority concurrent with Scripture, and a priesthood dispensing
   grace through the sacraments. It will end as the theory of a passing
   school. Our sketch will show on what grounds we judge it a
   contradiction to the standards of the body, the consensus of its
   fathers down to Hooker, and an utter misstatement of the historic
   position of the Church of England. It may be hoped that the long strife
   will lead to a better understanding of its relation to other Reformed
   communions, and to its place in the common work for the unity of
   Christendom.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1142] The ingenious and sophistical attempt of Dr. John Henry Newman,
   in his famous Tract Number Ninety (Oxford, 1841), to un-Protestantize
   the Thirty-nine Articles, has been best refuted by his own subsequent
   transition to Rome. As a specimen of this non-natural interpretation we
   mention what he says on Art. XI., which teaches as 'a most wholesome
   doctrine' 'that we are justified by faith only.' This means that faith
   is the sole internal instrument of justification, while baptism is the
   sole outward means and instrument; it does not interfere with the
   doctrine that good works are also a means of justification (pp. 21
   sqq.). That is, the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith
   alone, which the Council of Trent condemned, is identical with the
   Romish doctrine of justification by faith and works, which the same
   Council taught. A more learned and elaborate work, which minimizes the
   Protestantism of the Articles and makes them bear a catholic sense, is
   the Explanation by the late Bishop Forbes of Brechin, above quoted.

   [1143] His second wife, whom he secretly married in 1532, before his
   elevation to the primacy (March, 1533), was a niece of the Lutheran
   divine Osiander at Nürnberg, who subsequently excited a violent
   controversy about the doctrine of justification.

   [1144] Melanchthon was twice called to England in 1534 ('Ego jam
   alteris literis in Angliam vocor'). In 1535 he dedicated an edition of
   his Loci to Henry, at the request of Barnes, who thought it would
   promote the progress of the Reformation. Henry renewed the invitation
   in 1538, and requested the Elector of Saxony to send 'Dominum Philippum
   Melancthonem, in cuius excellenti eruditione et sano judicio a bonis
   omnibus multa spes reposita est,' together with some other learned men,
   to England. Under Edward VI. Melanchthon was called again, and in 1553
   he was appointed Professor of Divinity in Cambridge, but he never saw
   England. See Laurence, l.c. pp. 198 sqq.; Hardwick, Hist. of the Art.
   pp. 52 sqq.; C. Schmidt, Phil. Mel. pp. 283-289.

   [1145] So his ultimate doctrine is correctly stated by Hardwick,
   History of the Reformation, p. 209. Cranmer wrote very extensively on
   the eucharist, and especially against the Romish mass. See the first
   volume of the Parker Society's edition of his Works. His change of view
   is due to the influence of the book of Ratramnus (Bertram) against
   transubstantiation, the tract of Bullinger on the eucharist, and the
   personal influence of Ridley, Peter Martyr, and Bucer. Bishop Browne
   says (on Art. XXVIII. Sect. I. p. 711 of the Am. ed.): 'Both Cranmer
   and Ridley, to whom we are chiefly indebted for our formularies,
   maintained the doctrine nearly identical with that maintained by
   Calvin, and before him by Bertram. . . . These sentiments of our
   Reformers were undoubtedly embodied in our Liturgy and Articles. . . .
   In the main, Calvin, Melanchthon in his later views, and the Anglican
   divines were at one.' John Knox entirely agreed with Cranmer in the
   Reformed doctrine of the eucharist, and he objected only to the
   kneeling posture, which led to the insertion of a special rubric in the

   [1147] Stähelin, Vol. II. pp. 51 sqq., discusses at length Calvin's
   correspondence with England. Hardwick speaks of 'the obtrusive letters
   of Calvin;' but his counsel was solicited from every direction. In the
   controversy of the English exiles at Frankfort both parties (Cox and
   Knox) appealed to the Genevan Reformer for advice. Cranmer requested
   him to write often to King Edward. See Calvin to Farel, June 15, 1551
   (Opera, Vol. XIV. fol. 133): 'Cantuariensis nihil me utilius facturum
   admonuit, quam si ad Regem sæpius scriberem. Hoc mihi longe gratius,
   quam si ingenti pecuniæ summa ditatus forem.' Viret informed Farel in
   the same year and month (ibid. fol. 131), that the king sent to Calvin
   'coronatos centum et libellum a se conscriptum gallice in papatum,
   cuius censuram a Calvino exigit. . . . Accepit Calvinus a multis Angliæ
   proceribus multas literas plenas humanitatis. Omnes testantur se ejus
   ingenio et laboribus valde oblectari. Hortantur ut sæpe scribat.
   Protector scripsit nominatim.'

   of the Reformation, p. 212.

   [1149] The influence of Knox upon the English Reformation has been more
   fully brought to light from the Knox Papers in Dr. Williams's library
   at London by Dr. Peter Lorimer, in John Knox and the Church of England
   (London, 1875), pp. 98 sqq.

   [1150] Zurich Letters, second series, I. 100. Prof. Fisher, in quoting
   this passage, adds the just remark (The Reformation, p. 341): 'There is
   no need in bringing further evidence on this point, since the Articles
   themselves explicitly assert the Calvinistic view [on the Lord's
   Supper]. In speaking of the English Reformers as Calvinists, it is not
   implied that they derived their opinions from Calvin exclusively, or
   received them on his authority. They were able and learned men, and
   explored the Scriptures and the patristic writers for themselves. Yet
   no name was held in higher honor among them than that of the Genevan
   Reformer.'

   [1151] When Robert Sanderson (Professor of Theology in Oxford, 1642,
   afterwards Bishop of Lincoln, d. 1663) began to study theology in
   Oxford about 1606, he was recommended, as was usual at that time, to
   read Calvin's Institutes, 'as the best and perfectest system of
   divinity, and the fittest to be laid as the ground-work in the study of
   this profession.' Blunt, Dictionary of Sects, etc., p. 97. Comp.
   Hooker's judgment below, p. 607.

   [1152] 'Nam hoc scito, post unicæ scripturæ sacratissimam cognitionem,
   nullos unquam ex omni memoria temporum scriptores extitisse, quos
   memorabili viro Joanni Calvino tibique præferamus.' See Scrivener's
   Codex Bezæ, Introd. p. vi., and his Introd. to the Critic. of the New
   Testament, second edition, 1874, p. 112. Scrivener regards this
   veneration as an ill omen 'for the peace of the English Church.'

   [1153] See my tract on the Revision of the English Version of the New
   Testament, pp. 28, 29, and Westcott's History of the English Bible, pp.
   294 sq. A number of errors in the English Version, as well as
   excellences, can be traced to Beza.

   [1154] Macaulay (in his introductory chapter, p. 39, Boston edition)
   says: 'The English Reformers were eager to go as far as their brethren
   on the Continent. They unanimously condemned as anti-Christian numerous
   dogmas and practices to which Henry had stubbornly adhered, and which
   Elizabeth reluctantly abandoned. Many felt a strong repugnance even to
   things indifferent, which had formed part of the polity or ritual of
   the mystical Babylon.'

   [1155] So called because they are mostly derived from the extensive
   Simler Collection of Zurich, where the Marian exiles, as Bishop Burnet
   says, 'were entertained both by the magistrates and the
   ministers--Bullinger, Gualter, Weidner, Simler, Lavater, Gesner, and
   all the rest of that body--with a tenderness and affection that engaged
   them to the end of their lives to make the greatest acknowledgments
   possible for it.' The correspondence was published by the Parker
   Society (Cambridge, 1842-47, in four vols.), in two series, the first
   of which covers the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary; the
   second and more important the reign of Elizabeth (1558-1602). They
   include letters of most of the English Reformers and leading bishops
   and divines to the Swiss Reformers, with their answers, and are noble
   monuments of Christian and theological friendship.

   Articles of the Synod of Dort signed by them in the Year 1619. London,
   1624. There is, however, at the close of this document (p. 176) a
   wholesome warning 'concerning the mystery of reprobation,' that it be
   'handled sparingly and prudently,' and that 'those fearful opinions,
   and such as have no ground in the Scriptures, be carefully avoided,
   which tend rather unto desperation than edification, and do bring upon
   some of the Reformed Churches a grievous scandal.'

   [1157] In accordance with an act of the thirty-seventh year of Henry
   VIII., which declares that 'Archbishops and the other ecclesiastical
   persons had no manner of jurisdiction ecclesiastical but by, under, and
   from his Royal Majesty; and that his Royal Majesty was the only supreme
   head of the Church of England and Ireland, to whom, by holy Scripture,
   all authority and power was wholly given,' etc.

   [1158] Laud made such a near approach to Rome that he was offered a
   cardinal's hat (Aug. 1633). When he first maintained, in his exercise
   for Bachelor of Divinity, in 1604, the doctrine that there could be no
   true Church without a bishop, he was reproved by the authorities at
   Oxford, because he 'cast a bone of contention between the Church of
   England and the Reformed on the Continent.' But when he was in power he
   spared no effort to force his theory upon reluctant Puritans in England
   and Presbyterians in Scotland.

   [1159] The facts above stated are acknowledged by the best authorities
   of the Church of England of all parties, such as Strype, Burnet,
   Lathbury, Keble, and by secular historians such as Hallam and Macaulay.
   See a calm and thorough argument of Prof. G. P. Fisher, The Relation of
   the Church of England to the other Protestant Churches, in the
   'New-Englander' for January, 1874, pp. 121-172. This article grew out
   of a newspaper controversy in the New York Tribune, occasioned by the
   secession of Bishop Cummins after the General Conference of the
   Evangelical Alliance at New York, October, 1873. This
   inter-denominational Conference had the express sanction of the
   Archbishop of Canterbury in a letter addressed to the Dean of
   Canterbury, one of the prominent delegates. See Proceedings (published
   N. Y., 1874), p. 720. Comp. also Dr. Washburn, Relation of the
   Episcopal Church to other Christian Bodies, N. Y., 1874.

   [1160] He also says: 'Of what account the Master of Sentences [Peter
   Lombard] was in the Church of Rome, the same and more amongst the
   preachers of Reformed Churches Calvin had purchased; so that the
   perfectest divines were judged they which were skillfulest in Calvin's
   writings; his books almost the very canon to judge both doctrine and
   discipline by.' See Hooker's lengthy account of Calvin's life and
   labors in the Preface to his work on the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity,
   Vol. I. pp. 158-174, edition of Dr. John Keble.

   [1161] Dr. Keble, who was a High Anglican or Anglo-Catholic of the
   Oxford school, says in the Preface to his edition (p. xcix.): 'With
   regard to the points usually called Calvinistic, Hooker undoubtedly
   favored the tone and language, which has since come to be
   characteristic of that school, commonly adopted by those theologians to
   whom his education led him as guides and models on occasions where no
   part of Calvinism comes expressly into debate. It is possible that this
   may cause him to appear, to less profound readers, a more decided
   partisan of Calvin than he really was. At least it is certain that on
   the following subjects he was himself decidedly in favor of very
   considerable modifications of the Genevan theology.' Keble then
   contrasts the strict Calvinism of the Lambeth Articles with the
   cautious predestinarianism of Hooker as expressed in a fragment which
   teaches eternal election and the final perseverance of the foreknown
   elect, without mentioning reprobation, and makes condemnation depend on
   'the foresight of sin as the cause.' Judas went to his place, which was
   'of his own proper procurement. Devils were not ordained of God for
   hell-fire, but hell-fire for them; and for men so far as it was
   foreseen that men would be like them.' There are, however, as Keble
   himself admits, passages in Hooker which are more strongly Calvinistic,
   especially on the doctrine of the perseverance of saints, which he
   considers hardly consistent with his doctrine of universal baptismal
   grace. But both these doctrines were held by Augustine likewise, from
   whom Hooker borrowed them.

   § 78. The Doctrinal Formulas of Henry VIII.

   THE TEN ARTICLES.

   The first doctrinal deliverance of the Church of England after the
   rupture with Rome is contained in the Ten Articles of 1536, devised by
   Henry VIII. (who styles himself in the preface 'by the grace of God
   king of England and of France, defender of the faith, lord of Ireland,
   and in earth supreme head of the Church of England'), and approved by
   convocation. [1162] They are essentially Romish, with the Pope left out
   in the cold. They can not even be called a compromise between the
   advocates of the 'old learning,' headed by Gardiner (Bishop of
   Winchester from 1531), and of the 'new learning,' headed by Cranmer
   (Archbishop of Canterbury from March, 1533). Their chief object,
   according to the preface, was to secure by royal authority unity and
   concord in religious opinions, and to 'repress' and 'utterly
   extinguish' all dissent and discord touching the same. They were, in
   the language of Foxe, intended for 'weaklings newly weaned from their
   mother's milk of Rome.' They assert (1) the binding authority of the
   Bible, the three oecumenical creeds, and the first four oecumenical
   councils; (2) the necessity of baptism for salvation, even in the case
   of infants; [1163] (3) the sacrament of penance, with confession and
   absolution, which are declared 'expedient and necessary;' (4) the
   substantial, real, corporal presence of Christ's body and blood under
   the form of bread and wine in the eucharist; (5) justification by
   faith, joined with charity and obedience; (6) the use of images in
   churches; (7) the honoring of saints and the Virgin Mary; (8) the
   invocation of saints; (9) the observance of various rites and
   ceremonies as good and laudable, such as clerical vestments, sprinkling
   of holy water, bearing of candles on Candlemas-day, giving of ashes on
   Ash-Wednesday; (10) the doctrine of purgatory, and prayers for the dead
   in purgatory.

   THE BISHOPS' BOOK AND THE KING'S BOOK. [1164]

   These Articles were virtually, though not legally, superseded by the
   'Bishops' Book,' or the 'Institution of a Christian Man,' drawn up by a
   Committee of Prelates, 1537, but never sanctioned by the king. It
   contains an Exposition of the Creed, the Seven Sacraments, the Ten
   Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Ave Maria, and a discussion of the
   disputed doctrines of justification and purgatory, and the human origin
   of the papacy. It marks a little progress, which must be traced to the
   influence of Cranmer and Ridley, but it was superseded by a reactionary
   revision called the 'King's Book,' or the 'Necessary Doctrine and
   Erudition for any Christian Man,' sanctioned by Convocation, and set
   forth by royal mandate in 1543, when Gardiner and the Romish party were
   in the ascendant.

   THE THIRTEEN ARTICLES.

   During the negotiations with the Lutheran divines (1535-1538), held
   partly at Wittenberg, partly at Lambeth, an agreement consisting of
   Thirteen Articles was drawn up in Latin, at London, in the summer of
   1538, which did not receive the sanction of the king, but was made use
   of in the following reign as a basis of several of the Forty-two
   Articles. They have been recently discovered in their collected form,
   by Dr. Jenkyns, among the manuscripts of Archbishop Cranmer in the
   State Paper Office. [1165] They treat of the Divine Unity and Trinity,
   Original Sin, the Two Natures of Christ, Justification, the Church,
   Baptism, the Eucharist, Penitence, the Use of the Sacraments, the
   Ministers of the Church, Ecclesiastical Rites, Civil Affairs, the
   Resurrection and Final Judgment. They are based upon the Augsburg
   Confession, some passages being almost literally copied from the same.
   [1166]

   THE SIX ARTICLES.

   The Thirteen Articles remained a dead letter in the reign of Henry. He
   broke off all connection with the Lutherans, and issued in 1539, under
   the influence of Gardiner and the Romish party, and in spite of the
   protest of Cranmer, the monstrous statute of the Six Articles, ' for
   the abolishing of Diversity of Opinions.' They are justly called the
   'bloody' Articles, and a 'whip with six strings.' They bore severely
   not only upon the views of the Anabaptists and all radical Protestants,
   who in derision were called 'Gospellers,' but also upon the previous
   negotiations with the Lutherans. After the burning of some Dissenters
   the Articles were somewhat checked in their operation, but remained
   legally in force till the death of the king, who grew more and more
   despotic, and prohibited (in 1542) Tyndale's 'false translation' of the
   Bible, and even the reading of the New Testament in English to all
   women, artificers, laborers, and husbandmen.

   The Six Articles imposed upon all Englishmen a belief (1) in
   transubstantiation, (2) the needlessness of communion in both kinds,
   (3) in clerical celibacy, (4) the obligation of vows of chastity or
   widowhood, (5) the necessity of private masses, (6) auricular
   confession. Here we have some of the most obnoxious features of
   Romanism. Whoever denied transubstantiation was to be burned at the
   stake; dissent from any of the other Articles was to be punished by
   imprisonment, confiscation of goods, or death, according to the degree
   of guilt.

   They are given by Fuller, Burnet, (Addenda), Collier, and Hardwick
   (Appendix I). In the Cotton MS. the title is, 'Articles about Religion,
   set out by the Convocation, and published by the King's authority.' It
   is impossible to determine how far the Articles are the product of the
   king (who in his own conceit was fully equal to any task in theology as
   well as Church government), and how far the product of his bishops and
   other clergy. See Hardwick, pp. 40 sqq.

   [1163] Art. II. says that 'infants ought to be baptized;' that, dying
   in infancy, they 'shall undoubtedly be saved thereby, and else not;'
   that the opinions of Anabaptists and Pelagians are 'detestable
   heresies, and utterly to be condemned.'

   and considerable variations.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 79. The Edwardine Articles. A.D. 1553.

   With the accession of Edward VI. (Jan. 28, 1547) Cranmer and the reform
   party gained the controlling influence. The Six Articles were
   abolished. The First Prayer-Book of Edward VI. was prepared and set
   forth (1549), and a few years afterwards the Second, with sundry
   changes (1552).

   The reformation of worship was followed by that of doctrine. For some
   time Cranmer entertained the noble but premature idea of framing, with
   the aid of the German and Swiss Reformers, an evangelical catholic
   creed, which should embrace 'all the heads of ecclesiastical doctrine,'
   especially an adjustment of the controversy on the eucharist, and serve
   as a protest to the Council of Trent, and as a bond of union among the
   Protestant Churches. [1167]

   This project was reluctantly abandoned in favor of a purely English
   formula of public doctrine, the Forty-two Articles of Religion. They
   were begun by Cranmer in 1549, subjected to several revisions,
   completed in November, 1552, and published in 1553, together with a
   short Catechism, by 'royal authority,' and with the approval of 'a
   Synod (Convocation) at London.' [1168] It is, however, a matter of
   dispute whether they received the formal sanction of Convocation, or
   were circulated on the sole authority of the royal council during the
   brief reign of Edward (who died July 6, 1553). [1169] The chief title
   to the authorship of the Articles, as well as of the revised Liturgy,
   belongs to Cranmer; it is impossible to determine how much is due to
   his fellow-Reformers--'bishops and other learned men'--and the foreign
   divines then residing in England, to whom the drafts were submitted, or
   whose advice was solicited. [1170]

   The Edwardine Articles are essentially the same as the Thirty-nine,
   with the exception of a few (three of them borrowed from the Augsburg
   Confession), which were omitted in the Elizabethan revision--namely,
   one on the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (Art. XVI.); one on the
   obligation of keeping the moral commandments--against
   antinomianism--(XIX.); one on the resurrection of the dead (XXXIX.);
   one on the state of the soul after death--against the Anabaptist notion
   of the psychopannychia--(XL.); one against the millenarians (XLI.);
   [1171] and one against the doctrine of universal salvation (XLII.).
   [1172] A clause in the article on Christ's descent into Hades (Art.
   III.), [1173] and a strong protest against the ubiquity of Christ's
   body, and 'the real and bodily presence of Christ's flesh and blood in
   the sacrament of the Lord's Supper' (in Art. XXIX.), were likewise
   omitted.

   which is a strong protest against ubiquitarianism and any idolatrous

   § 80. The Elizabethan Articles. A.D. 1563 and 1571.

   After the temporary suppression of Protestantism under Queen Mary, the
   Reformed hierarchy, Liturgy, and Articles of Religion were permanently
   restored, with a number of changes, by Queen Elizabeth.

   In 1559, Archbishop Parker, with the other prelates, set forth, as a
   provisional test of orthodoxy, Eleven Articles, taken in part from
   those of 1553, but differing in form and avoiding controverted topics.
   [1174] They were superseded by the Thirty-nine Articles.

   THE LATIN EDITION, 1563.

   At the first meeting of the two Convocations, which were summoned by
   Elizabeth in January, 1563, Parker submitted a revision of the Latin
   Articles of 1553, prepared by him with the aid of Bishop Cox of Ely,
   Bishop Guest of Rochester, and others, who had already taken an active
   part in the revision of the Prayer-book. [1175] After an examination by
   both houses, the Articles, reduced to the number of thirty-nine, were
   ratified and signed by the Bishops and the members of the lower house,
   and published by the royal press, 1563.

   It is stated that Elizabeth 'diligently read and sifted' the document
   before giving her assent. To her influence must probably be traced two
   characteristic changes of the printed copy as compared with the Parker
   MS.--namely, the insertion of the famous clause in Art. XX., affirming
   the authority of the Church in matters of faith--and the omission of
   Art. XXIX., which denies that the unworthy communicants partake of the
   body and blood of Christ. [1176] The latter Article, however, was
   restored by the Bishops, May 11, 1571, and appears in all the printed
   copies since that time, both English and Latin.

   THE ENGLISH EDITION, 1571.

   The authorized English text was adopted by Convocation in 1571, and
   issued under the editorial care of Bishop Jewel of Salesbury. It
   presents sundry variations from the Latin edition of 1563. Both
   editions are considered equally authoritative and mutually explanatory.
   [1177]

   THE ROYAL DECLARATION OF 1628.

   After the Synod of Dort, to which James I. sent a strong delegation,
   the Arminian controversy spread in England, and caused such an
   agitation that the king, who, according to his own estimate and that of
   his flatterers, was equal to Solomon in wisdom, ordered Archbishop
   Abbot (Aug. 4, 1622) to prohibit the lower clergy from preaching on the
   five points. [1178] Charles I., in concert with Archbishop Laud (who
   sympathized with Arminianism), issued a Proclamation (1626) of similar
   import, deploring the prevalence of theological dissension, and
   threatening to visit with severe penalties those clergymen who should
   raise, publish, or maintain opinions not clearly warranted by the
   formularies of the Church.

   As this proclamation did not silence the controversy, Charles was
   advised by Laud to order the republication of the thirty-nine Articles
   with a Preface regulating the interpretation of the same. This Preface,
   called 'His Majesty's Declaration,' was issued in 1628, and has ever
   since accompanied the English editions of the Articles. [1179] Its
   object was to check Calvinism (although it is not named), and the
   quinquarticular controversy ('all further curious search' on 'those
   curious points in which the present differences lie'), and to restrict
   theological opinions to the 'literal and grammatical sense' of the
   Articles. [1180] It was greeted by Arminians and High-Churchmen, who
   praise its moderation, [1181] but was resisted by Calvinists and the
   Puritan party then prevailing in the House of Commons, which declared
   its determination to suppress both 'Popery and Arminianism.' [1182] The
   subsequent history of England has shown how little royal and
   parliamentary proclamations and prohibitions avail against the
   irresistible force of ideas and the progress of theology.

   SUBSCRIPTION.

   Queen Elizabeth was at first opposed to any action of Parliament on
   questions of religious doctrine, which she regarded as the highest
   department of her own royal supremacy; but in May, 1571, she was forced
   by her council, in view of popish agitations, to give her assent to a
   bill of Parliament which required all priests and teachers of religion
   to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles. [1183]

   Subscription was first rigidly enforced by Archbishop Whitgift (in
   1584, which is noted as 'the woful year of subscription'), and by
   Bancroft (1604).

   This test of orthodoxy was even applied to academical students. At
   Oxford a decree of Convocation, in 1573, required students to subscribe
   before taking their degrees, and in 1576 this requirement was extended
   to students above sixteen years of age on their admission. At Cambridge
   the law was less rigid.

   The Act of Uniformity under Charles II. imposed with more stringency
   than ever subscription on the clergy and every head of a college. But
   the Toleration Act of William and Mary gave some relief by exempting
   dissenting ministers from subscribing to Arts. XXXIV--XXXVI. and a
   portion of XXVII. Subsequent attempts to relax or abolish subscription
   resulted at last in the University Tests Act of 1871, by which 'no one,
   at Oxford, Cambridge, or Durham, in order to take a degree, except in
   divinity, or to exercise any right of graduates, can be required to
   make any profession of faith.' [1184]

   RELATION TO THE EDWARDINE ARTICLES.

   The Elizabethan Articles differ from the Edwardine Articles, besides
   minor verbal alterations--

   (1.) In the omission of seven Articles (Edwardine X., XVI., XIX.,
   XXXIX. to XLII.). The last four of them reject certain Anabaptist
   doctrines, which had in the mean time disappeared or lost their
   importance. [1185] Art. XIX. of the old series, touching the obligation
   of the moral law, was transferred in substance to Art. VII. of the new
   series.

   (2.) In the addition of four Articles, viz.: On the Holy Ghost (Eliz.
   V.); on good works (XII.); on the participation of the wicked in the
   eucharist (XXIX.); on communion in both kinds (XXX.).

   (3.) In the partial curtailment or amplification of seventeen Articles.
   Among the amplifications are to be noticed the list of Canonical and
   Apocryphal Books (VI.), and of the Homilies (XXXV.); the restriction of
   the number of sacraments to two (XXV.); the condemnation of
   transubstantiation, and the declaration of the spiritual nature of
   Christ's presence (XXVIII.); the disapproval of worship in a foreign
   tongue (XXIV.); the more complete approval of infant baptism (XXVII.),
   and clerical marriage (XXXII.).

   The difference of the two series, and their relation to the Thirteen
   Articles, will be more readily seen from the following table:

   Thirteen Articles.
   1538 Forty-two Articles.
   1553 Thirty-nine Articles.

   [1174] They are printed by Hardwick in Append. IV. pp. 337-339.

   [1175] A manuscript copy of this revision, with numerous corrections
   and autograph signatures of Matthæus Cantuar.' (Parker), and other
   prelates (including some of the northern province), is preserved among
   the Parker MSS. in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and was published
   by Dr. Lamb in 1829. The handwriting (as Mr. Lewis, the librarian,
   informed me when there on a visit in July, 1875) is probably Jocelin's,
   the secretary of Parker. The copy contains also the older Articles Nos.
   40-42, but marked by a red line as to be omitted. This copy is probably
   the same which Parker submitted to Convocation, but it presents several
   variations (especially in Art. XX.) from the copy of the Convocation
   records. Comp. Hardwick, pp. 125 and 135 sqq.

   [1176] Hardwick, pp. 143 sqq.

   [1177] This is the view of Burnet and Waterland, adopted by Hardwick,
   p. 158. Waterland says {Works, Vol. II. pp. 316, 317): 'As to the
   Articles, English and Latin, I may just observe for the sake of such
   readers as are less acquainted with these things: first, that the
   Articles were passed, recorded, and ratified in the year 1562 [1563],
   and in Latin only. Secondly, that those Latin Articles were revised and
   corrected by the convocation of 1571. Thirdly, that an authentic
   English translation was then made of the Latin Articles by the same
   convocation, and the Latin and English adjusted as nearly as possible.
   Fourthly, that the Articles thus perfected in both languages were
   published the same year, and by the royal authority. Fifthly,
   subscription was required the same year to the English Articles, called
   the Articles of 1562, by the famous act of the 13th of
   Elizabeth.--These things considered, I might justly say with Bishop
   Burnet, that the Latin and English are both equally authentical. Thus
   much, however, I may certainly infer, that if in any places the English
   version be ambiguous, where the Latin original is clear and
   determinate, the Latin ought to fix the more doubtful sense of the
   other (as also vice versa), it being evident that the Convocation,
   Queen, and Parliament intended the same sense in both.'

   [1178] One of the directions reads: 'That no preacher of what title
   soever, under the degree of a Bishop, or Dean at least, do from
   henceforth presume to preach in any popular auditory the deep points of
   predestination, election, reprobation, or the universality, efficacy,
   resistibility or irresistibility of divine grace; but leave those
   themes to be handled by learned men, and that moderately and modestly,
   by way of use and application, rather than by way of positive doctrine,
   as being fitter for the schools and Universities than for simple
   auditories.'--Wilkins, Vol. IV. p. 465; Hardwick, p. 202.

   [1179] It disappeared, of course, in the American editions. It is
   printed in Vol. III. p. 486.

   [1180] 'No man shall either print or preach or draw the Article' [the
   previous sentence speaks of the Articles generally, perhaps Art. XVII.
   on predestination is meant particularly] 'aside any way, but shall
   submit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof; and shall not put
   his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall
   take it in the literal and grammatical sense.' In a 'Declaration' of
   Charles on the dissolution of Parliament (March 10, 1628), he says,
   concerning his intention in issuing the Declaration before the
   Articles: 'We did tie and restrain all opinions to the sense of these
   Articles that nothing might be left to fancies and invocations'
   [probably an error for 'innovations']. 'For we call God to record,
   before whom we stand, that it is, and always hath been, our chief
   heart's desire, to be found worthy of that title, which we account the
   most glorious in all our crown, Defender of the Faith.'--Hardwick, p.
   206.

   [1181] Hardwick says (p. 205): 'A document more sober and conciliatory
   could not well have been devised.' Bishop Forbes goes further, and
   thinks that it was 'the enunciation of the Catholic sense of the
   Articles,' and that Newman's Tract XC. and Pusey's Irenicon are
   'legitimate outcomes of the King's Declaration' (1.c. Vol. I. p. xi.).

   [1182] The House passed the following vote and manifesto on the royal
   Declaration: 'We, the Commons in Parliament assembled, do claim,
   protest, and avow for truth, the sense of the Articles of Religion
   which were established by Parliament in the thirteenth year of our late
   Queen Elizabeth, which by the public act of the Church of England, and
   by the general and current expositions of the writers of our Church,
   have been delivered unto us. And we reject the sense of the Jesuits and
   Arminians, and all others, wherein they differ from us.'--Hardwick, p.
   206.

   [1183] Stat. 13 Eliz. c. 12. It enacts 'by the authority of the present
   Parliament, that every person under the degree of a bishop, which doth
   or shall pretend to be a priest or minister of God's holy Word and
   Sacraments, by reason of any other form of institution, consecration,
   or ordering, than the form set forth by Parliament in the time of the
   late King of most worthy memory, King Edward the Sixth, or now used, .
   . . shall . . . declare his assent, and subscribe to all the Articles
   of Religion, which only concern the confession of the true Christian
   faith and the doctrine of the sacraments comprised in a book entitled
   Articles, . . . put forth by the Queen's authority.' The subscription
   to the Articles was urged by the Puritanic party in Parliament in
   opposition to Romanism. See Hardwick, pp. 150 sq. The wording of the
   statute was made use of to confine assent to the doctrinal Articles
   ('which only concern,' etc.), and to relieve the conscience of the
   Puritans who objected to the royal supremacy, the surplice, and other
   'defiled robes of Antichrist.'

   [1184] The various acts enforcing and relaxing subscription are
   conveniently collected in the Prayer-Book Interleaved, London, 7th ed.
   1873, pp. 360 sqq. See also chap. xi. of Hardwick's History of the
   Articles.

   § 81. The Interpretation of the Articles.

   The theological interpretation of the Articles by English writers has
   been mostly conducted in a controversial rather than an historical
   spirit, and accommodated to a particular school or party. Moderate
   High-Churchmen and Arminians, who dislike Calvinism, represent them as
   purely Lutheran; [1186] Anglo-Catholics and Tractarians, who abhor both
   Lutheranism and Calvinism, endeavor to conform them as much as possible
   to the contemporary decrees of the Council of Trent; [1187] Calvinistic
   and evangelical Low-Churchmen find in them substantially their own
   creed. [1188] Continental historians, both Protestant and Catholic,
   rank the Church of England among the Reformed Churches as distinct from
   the Lutheran, and her Articles are found in every collection of
   Reformed Confessions. [1189]

   The Articles must be understood in their natural grammatical and
   historical sense, from the stand-point and genius of the Reformation,
   the public and private writings of their compilers and earliest
   expounders. In doubtful cases we may consult the Homilies, the
   Catechism, the several revisions of the Prayer-book, the Canons, and
   other contemporary documents bearing on the reformation of doctrine and
   discipline in the Church of England.

   In a preceding section we have endeavored to give the historical key
   for the understanding of the doctrinal character of the English
   Articles. A closer examination will lead us to the following
   conclusions:

   1. The Articles are Catholic in the oecumenical doctrines of the Holy
   Trinity and the Incarnation, like all the Protestant Confessions of the
   Reformation period; and they state those doctrines partly in the very
   words of two Lutheran documents, viz., the Augsburg Confession and the
   Würtemberg Confession.

   2. They are Augustinian in the anthropological and soteriological
   doctrines of free-will, sin, and grace: herein likewise agreeing with
   the Continental Reformers, especially the Lutheran.

   3. They are Protestant and evangelical in rejecting the peculiar errors
   and abuses of Rome, and in teaching those doctrines of Scripture and
   tradition, justification by faith, faith and good works, the Church,
   and the number of sacraments, which Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin held in
   common.

   4. They are Reformed or moderately Calvinistic in the two doctrines of
   Predestination and the Lord's Supper, in which the Lutheran and
   Reformed Churches differed; although the chief Reformed Confessions
   were framed after the Articles.

   5. They are Erastian in the political sections, teaching the closest
   union of Church and State, and the royal supremacy in matters
   ecclesiastical as well as civil; with the difference, however, that the
   Elizabethan revision dropped the title of the king as 'supreme head in
   earth,' and excluded the ministry of the Word and Sacraments from the
   'chief government' of the English Church claimed by the crown. [1190]
   All the Reformation Churches were more or less intolerant, and enforced
   uniformity of belief as far as they had the power; but the Calvinists
   and Puritans were more careful of the rights of the Church over against
   the State than the Lutherans.

   6. Art. XXXV., referring to the Prayer-book and the consecration of
   archbishops, bishops, priests, and deacons, is purely Anglican and
   Episcopalian, and excited the opposition of the Puritans.

   We have now to furnish the proof as far as the doctrinal articles are
   concerned.

   THE ARTICLES AND THE AUGSBURG CONFESSION.

   The Edwardine Articles were based in part, as already observed, upon a
   previous draft of Thirteen Articles, which was the joint product of
   German and English divines, and based upon the doctrinal Articles of
   the Augsburg Confession. Some passages were transferred verbatim from
   the Lutheran document to the Thirteen Articles, and from these to the
   Forty-two (1553), and were retained in the Elizabethan revision (1563
   and 1571). This will appear from the following comparison. The
   corresponding words are printed in italics.

   Item docent, quod homines non possint justificari coram Deo propriis

   Christum per fidem, cum credunt se in gratiam recipi, et peccata
   remitti propter Christum, qui sua morte pro nostris peccatis
   satisfecit. Hanc fidem imputat Deus pro justitia coram ipso. Rom. III.
   et IV. [Art. IV. of the Augsburg Confession is enlarged, and Art. V.
   added. In this case the English Articles do not give the language, but
   the sense of the Lutheran symbols, with the unmistakeable 'sola fide,'
   which was Luther's watchword.] Tantum propter meritum Domini ac
   Servatoris nostri Iesu Christi, per fidem, non propter opera et merita
   nostra, iusti coram Deo reputamur. Quare sola fide nos iustificari,

   Art. VII. De Ecclesia. Art. V. De Ecclesia. Art. XIX. De Ecclesia.
   Item docent, quod una Sancta Ecclesia pepetuo mansura sit. Est autem
   Ecclesia congregatio Sanctorum [Versammlung aller Gläubigen], in qua
   Evangelium recte [rein] docetur, et recte [laut des Evangelii]
   administrantur Sacramenta.
      Et ad veram unitatem Ecclesiæ satis est consentire de doctrina
   Evangelii et administratione Sacramentorum. Nec necesse est ubique esse
   similes traditiones humanas, seu ritus aut ceremonias, ab hominibus
   institutas. Sicut inquit Paulus (Eph. iv. 5, 6): Una fides, unum
   Baptisma, unus Deus et Pater omnium, etc. [This Article is much
   enlarged, and makes an important distinction between the Church as the
   'congregatio omnium sanctorum et fidelium,' (the invisible Church),
   which is the mystical body of Christ, and the Church as the
   'congregatio omnium hominum qui baptizati sunt' (the visible Church).]
   Ecclesia Christi visibilis, est coetus fidelium, in quo verbum Dei
   purum prædicatur, et sacromenta, quoad ea quæ necessario exiguntur,
   iuxta Christi institutum recte administrantur. [1192]
      Sicut erravit Ecclesia Hierosolymitana, Alexandrina et Antiochena:
   ita et erravit Ecclesia Romana, non solum quoad agenda et cæremoniarum
   ritus, verum in his etiam quæ credenda sunt.
      [Compare Art. XXXIII., which treats of ecclesiastical traditions,
   and corresponds in sentiment to the second clause in Art. VII. of the
   Augsburg Confession.]
   Art. XIII. De Usu Sacramentorum. Art. IX. De Sacramentorum Usu. Art.
   XXV. De Sacramentis.
   De usu Sacramentorum docent, quod Sacramenta instituta, sint, non modo
   ut Docemus, quod Sacramenta quæ per verbum Dei instituta sunt, non
   tantum Sacramenta a Christo instituta non tantum sunt notæ professionis
   Christianorum,

   sint notæ professionis inter homines, sed magis ut sint signa et
   testimonia voluntatis Dei erga nos, ad excitandam et confirmandam
   fidem, in his, qui utuntur, proposita. Itaque utendum est Sacramentis
   ita, ut fides accedat, quæ credat promissionibus, quæ per Sacramenta
   exhibentur et ostenduntur.
      Damnant igitur illos, qui docent, quod Sacramenta ex opere operato
   justificent, nec docent fidem requiri in usu Sacramentorum, quæ credat
   remitti peccata. sint notæ professionis inter Christianos, sed magis
   certa quædam testimonia et efficacia signa gratiæ, et bonæ voluntatis
   Dei erga nos, per quæ Deus invisibiliter operatur in nobis, et suam
   gratiam in nos invisibiliter diffundit, siquidem ea rite susceperimus;
   quodque per ea excitatur et confirmatur fides in his qui eis utuntur.
   Porro docemus, quod ita utendum sit sacramentis, ut in adultis, præter
   veram contritionem, necessario etiam debeat accedere fides, quæ credat
   præsentibus promissionibus, quæ per sacramenta ostenduntur, exhibentur,
   et præstantur. Neque, etc. sed certa quædam potius testimonia, et
   efficacia signa gratiæ atque bonæ in nos voluntatis Dei, per quæ
   invisibiliter ipse in nobis operatur, nostramque fidem in se, non solum
   excitat, verum etiam confirmat.

   Besides these passages, there is a close resemblance in thought, though
   not in language, in the statements of the doctrine of original sin,
   [1193] and of the possibility of falling after justification. [1194]
   Several of the Edwardine Articles, also, which were omitted in the
   Elizabethan revision, were suggested by Art XVII. of the Augsburg
   Confession, which is directed against the Anabaptists.

   THE ARTICLES AND THE WÜRTEMBERG CONFESSION.

   In the Elizabethan revision of the Articles another Lutheran Confession
   was used (in Arts. II., V., VI., X., XI., and XX.)--namely, the
   Confessio Würtembergica, drawn up by the Suabian Reformer, Brentius (at
   a time when he was still in full harmony with Melanchthon), in the name
   of Duke Christopher of Würtemberg (1551), and presented by his
   delegates to the Council of Trent (Jan. 24, 1552). [1195] Soon after
   the accession of Elizabeth the negotiations with the German Lutherans
   (which had been broken off in 1538) were resumed, with a view to join
   the Smalcaldian League, but led to no definite result. It was probably
   during these negotiations that the Würtemberg Confession became known
   in England; and as it had acquired a public notoriety by its
   presentation at Trent, and was a restatement of the Augsburg Confession
   adapted to the new condition of things, it was very natural that it
   should be compared in the revision of the Articles. Melanchthon's
   'Saxon Repetition of the Augsburg Confession' would indeed have
   answered the same purpose equally well, but perhaps it was not known in

   Art. II. De Filio Dei (Heppe, p.492). Art. II. Verbum Dei verum hominem
   esse factum.
   Credimus et confitemur Filium Dei, Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum, ab
   æterno a Patre suo genitum, verum et æternum Deum, Patri suo
   consubstantialem, et in plenitudine temporia factum hominem, etc. Ab
   æterno a Patre genitus, verus et æternus Deus, ac Patri
   consubstantialis.
   Art. III. De Spiritu Sancto (Heppe, p. 493). Art. V. De Spiritu Sancto.
   Credimus et confitemur Spiritum Sanctum ab æterno procedere a Deo Patre
   et Filio, et esse ejusdem cum Patre et Filio essentiæ, majestatis, et
   gloriæ, verum ac æternum Deum. Spiritus Sanctus, a Patre et Filio
   procedens, ejusdem est cum Patre et Filio essentiæ, majestatis, et
   gloriæ, verus ac æternus Deus.
   Art. XXX. De Sacra Scriptura (Heppe, p. 540). Art. VI. Divinæ Scripturæ
   doctrina sufficit ad salutem.
   Sacram Scripturam vocamus eos Canonicos libros veteris et novi
   Testamenti, de quorum authoritate in Ecclesia nunquam dubitatum est. .
   . . Sacræ Scripturæ nomine eos Canonicos libros veteris et novi
   Testamenti intelligimus, de quorum auctoritate in Ecclesia nunquam
   dubitatum est.

   Art. IV. De Peccato (Heppe, p.498). Art. X. De Libero Arbitrio.
   Quod autem nonnulli affirmant homini post lapsum tantam animi
   integritatem relictam, ut possit sese, naturalibus suis viribus et
   bonis operibus, ad fidem et invocationem Dei convertere ac præparare,
   haud obscure pugnat cum Apostolica doctrina, et cum vero Ecclesiæ
   Catholicæ consensu. Ea est hominis post lapsum Adæ conditio, ut sese,
   naturalibus suis viribus et bonis operibus, ad fidem et invocationem
   Dei convertere ac præparare non possit. [The next clause, 'Quare absque
   gratia Dei,' etc., is taken almost verbatim from Augustine, De gratia
   et lib. arbitrio, c. 17 (al. 33).]
   Art. V. De Justificatione (Heppe, p. 495). Art. XI. De Hominis
   Justificatione.
   Homo enim fit Deo acceptus, et reputatur coram eo justus, propter solum
   Filium Dei, Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum, per fidem. Tantum propter
   meritum Domini ac Servatoris nostri Jesu Christi, per fidem, non
   propter opera et merita nostra, justi coram Deo reputamur.
   Art. VIII. De Evangelio Christi (Heppe, p. 500.
   Nec veteris nec novi Testamenti hominibus contingat æterna salus
   propter meritum operum Legis, sed tantum propter meritum Domini nostri
   Jesu Christi, per fidem.
   Art. VII. De Bonis Operibus (Heppe, p. 499). Art. XII. De Bonis
   Operibus.
   Non est autem sentiendum, quod iis bonis operibus, quæ per nos facimus,
   in judicio Dei, ubi agitur de expiatione peccatorum, et placatione
   divinæ iræ, ac merito æternæ salutis, confidendem sit. Omnia enim bona
   opera, quæ nos facimus, sunt imperfecta, nec possunt severitatem divini
   judicii ferre. Bona opera, quæ sunt fructus fidei, et justificatos
   sequuntur, quanquam peccata nostra expiare, et divini judicii
   severitatem ferre non possunt, Deo tamen, grata sunt et accepta in
   Christo. . . .
   Art. XXXII. De Ecclesia (Heppe, p. 544). Art. XX. De Ecclesiæ
   Autoritate.
   Credimus et confitemur, quod una sit Sancta Catholica et Apostolica
   Ecclesia, juxta symbolum Apostolorum et Nicænum. . . . Habet Ecclesia
   ritus sive ceremonias statuendi jus, et in fidei controversiis
   auctoritatem, quamvis Ecclesiæ non licet quicquam instituere, quod
   verbo Dei scripto adversetur nec unum Scripturæ locum sic exponere
   potest ut alteri contradicat
   Quod hæc Ecclesia habeat jus judicandi de omnibus doctrinis, juxta
   illud, Probate spiritus, num ex Deo sint.
   Quod hæc Ecclesia habeat jus interpretandæ Scripturæ.

   THE ARTICLES AND THE REFORMED CONFESSIONS.

   We now proceed to those doctrines in which the Lutheran and the
   Reformed Churches differed and finally separated--namely, the doctrines
   of predestination and the eucharistic presence. Here we find the
   English Articles on the Reformed side. The authors and revisers formed
   their views on these subjects partly from an independent study of the
   Scriptures and Augustine, partly from contact with the Swiss divines.

   The principal Reformed Confessions were indeed published at a later
   date--the Gallican Confession in 1559; the Belgic in 1561; the
   Heidelberg Catechism in 1563; the Second Helvetic Confession in 1566.
   But Zwingli's and Bullinger's works, Calvin's Institutes (1536), and
   his Tract on the Lord's Supper (1541), the Zurich Consensus (1549), and
   the Geneva Consensus (1552), must have been more or less known in
   England. Bishop Hooper had become a thorough disciple of Bullinger by a
   long residence in Zurich before the accession of Edward VI., and was
   consulted on the Articles. Cranmer (as previously mentioned) embraced,
   with Ridley, the Reformed doctrine of the Lord's Supper as early as
   1548; he corresponded with the Swiss Reformers, as well as with
   Melanchthon, and invited them (March 1552) to England to frame a
   general creed; and he was in intimate personal connection with Bucer,
   Peter Martyr, John Laski, and Knox at the time he framed the Articles.
   [1196] From the same period we have a remarkable witness to the
   influence of Calvin's tracts in defense of the doctrine of
   predestination. [1197] Bartholomew Traheron, then Dean of Chichester,
   and librarian to King Edward, wrote to Bullinger from London, Sept. 10,
   1552, as follows: [1198] 'I am exceedingly desirous to know what you
   and the other very learned men who live at Zurich think respecting the
   predestination and providence of God. If you ask the reason, there are
   certain individuals here who lived among you some time, and who assert
   that you lean too much to Melanchthon's views. [1199] But the greater
   number among us, of whom I own myself to be one, embrace the opinion of
   John Calvin as being perspicuous, and most agreeable to holy Scripture.
   And we truly thank God that that excellent treatise of the very learned
   and excellent John Calvin against Pighius and one Georgius Siculus
   should have come forth at the very time when the question began to be
   agitated among us. [1200] For we confess that he has thrown, much light
   upon the subject, or rather so handled it as that we have never before
   seen any thing more learned or more plain. We are anxious, however, to
   know what are your opinions, to which we justly allow much weight. We
   certainly hope that you differ in no respect from his excellent and
   most learned opinion. At least you will please to point out what you
   approve in that treatise, or think defective, or reject altogether, if
   indeed you do reject any part of it, which we shall not easily
   believe.' To this letter Bullinger replied at length, but not to the
   satisfaction of the Dean, who wrote to him again, June 3, 1553, as
   follows: [1201] 'You do not approve of Calvin, when he states that God
   not only foresaw the fall of the first man, and in him the ruin of his
   posterity, but that he also at his own pleasure arranged it. But unless
   we allow this, we shall certainly take away both the providence and the
   wisdom of God altogether. I do not indeed perceive how this sentence of
   Solomon contains any thing less than this: "The Lord hath made all
   things for himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil"
   (Prov.xvi.4). And that of Paul: "Of him and through him, and to him are
   all things" (Rom. xi. 36). I pass over other expressions which the most
   learned Calvin employs, because they occur everywhere in the holy
   Scriptures.'

   The Elizabethan revision was the work of the Marian exiles, who felt
   themselves in complete theological harmony with the Swiss divines,
   especially with Bullinger of Zurich, who represented an improved type
   of Zwinglianism, and agreed with Calvin on the subject of the Lord's
   Supper (as expressed in the Consensus Tigurinus, 1549), but was more
   moderate and guarded on the subject of predestination. [1202] His
   writings seem to have been better known and exerted more influence in
   the earlier part of Elizabeth's reign than those of Calvin, which were
   more congenial to the Scotch mind; but they became all-powerful even in
   England towards the close of the sixteenth century.

   On this point we have the explicit testimonies of the very men who were
   the chief assistants of Archbishop Parker in the revision of the
   Articles. Bishop Horn, of Winchester, wrote to Henry Bullinger, Dec.
   13, 1563, soon after the adoption of the Latin revision: 'We have
   throughout England the same ecclesiastical doctrine as yourselves. . .
   . The people of England entertain on these points' [the sacraments, and
   'against the ubiquitarianism of Brentius'] 'the same opinions as you do
   at Zurich.' [1203] Bishop Grindal, of London, afterwards (1575) the
   successor of Parker in the primacy, wrote to Bullinger, Aug. 27, 1566:
   'We, who are now bishops, most fully agree in the pure doctrines of the
   gospel with your churches, and with the Confession you have lately set
   forth' [i.e., the Second Helvetic Confession, which appeared in the
   same year]. 'And we do not regret our resolution; for in the mean time,
   the Lord giving the increase, our churches are enlarged and
   established, which under other circumstances would have become a prey
   to the Ecebolians, Lutherans, and semi-papists.' [1204] In a letter to
   Calvin, dated June 19, 1563, Grindal says: 'As you and Bullinger are
   almost the only chief pillars remaining, we desire to enjoy you both
   (if it please God) as long as possible. I purposely omit mention of
   Brentius, who having undertaken the advocacy of the very worst of
   causes' [ubiquitarianism], 'seems no longer to acknowledge us as
   brethren.' [1205] The letters of Bishop Cox, of Ely, to Bullinger and
   Peter Martyr, though not so explicit, breathe the same spirit of
   grateful respect and affection. The strong testimony of Bishop Jewel of
   Salesbury, the final reviser of the English text and chief author of
   the Second Book of Homilies, we have already quoted. [1206]

   PREDESTINATION AND ELECTION.

   On the premundane mystery of predestination, which no system of
   philosophy or theology can satisfactorily solve in this world, and
   which ought to be approached with profound reverence and humility, all
   the Reformers, in their private writings, followed originally the
   teaching of the great Augustine and the greater St. Paul; meaning
   thereby to cut human merit and pride at the roots, and to give all the
   glory of our salvation to God alone. But the Lutheran symbols (with the
   exception of the later Formula of Concord) are silent on the subject,
   while most of the Reformed standards, under the influence of Calvin,
   give it a prominent place. The English Articles handle it with much
   wisdom and moderation, dwelling exclusively on the election of saints
   or predestination to life. We give the XVIIth Article in its original
   form with the later amendments; the clauses which were omitted in the
   Elizabethan revision are printed in italics, the words which were
   inserted or substituted are inclosed in brackets.

   Art. XVIII.

   OF PREDESTINATION AND ELECTION.

   Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby
   (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly
   decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and
   damnation those whom he hath chosen [in Christ] [1207] out of mankind,
   and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made
   to honor. Wherefore, such as have [they which be endued with] so
   excellent a benefit of God given unto them, be called according to
   God's purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through grace
   obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons [of God]
   by adoption: they be made like the image of God's [his] only begotten
   Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length,
   by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.

   As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in
   Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly
   persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of
   Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members,
   and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because
   it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation
   to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their
   love towards God: so, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the
   Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of
   God's Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil
   may [doth] thrust them either into desperation, or into wretchlessness
   of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.

   Furthermore, although the Decrees of Predestination are unknown unto
   us, yet we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be
   generally set forth to us in holy Scripture; and, in our doings, that
   Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us
   in the Word of God.

   This Article can not be derived from the Augsburg Confession, nor from
   the Thirteen Articles, nor from the Würtemberg Confession--for they
   omit the subject of predestination altogether [1208] --nor from
   Melanchthon's private writings, for he abandoned his former views, and
   suggested the synergistic theory as early as 1535, and more fully in
   1548. [1209] It can not be naturally understood in any other than an
   Augustinian or moderately Calvinistic sense. It does not, indeed, go as
   far as the Lambeth Articles (1595), which the stronger Calvinism of the
   rising generation thought necessary to add as an explanation. It omits
   the knotty points; it is cautiously framed and guarded against abuse.
   [1210] But it very clearly teaches a free eternal election in Christ,
   which carries with it, by way of execution in time, the certainty of
   the call, justification, adoption, sanctification, and final
   glorification (Rom. viii. 29, 30).

   This is all that is essential, and a matter of dogma in the Reformed
   Churches; the rest of what is technically called Calvinism, in
   distinction from Arminianism, is logical inference, and belongs to the
   theology of the school. It should be remembered that all the Reformed
   Confessions (even the Canons of Dort, the Westminster Confession, and
   the Helvetic Consensus Formula) keep within the limits of
   infralapsarianism, which puts the fall under a permissive decree, and
   makes man alone responsible for sin and condemnation; the most
   authoritative, as the Helvetic Confession of Bullinger, the Heidelberg
   Catechism, and the Brandenburg Confessions (also the Scotch Confession
   of 1560) teach only the positive and comforting part of predestination,
   and ignore or deny a separate decree of reprobation; thus taking the
   ground practically that all that are saved are saved by the free grace
   of God, while all that are lost are lost by their own guilt. They also
   teach that God's promises and Christ's redemption are general, and that
   we must abide by the revealed will of God, which sincerely offers the
   gospel salvation to all who repent and believe. [1211]

   The remarks of the Article about the 'sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable
   comfort' of our election in Christ, and the caution against abuse by
   carnal persons, are consistent only with the Calvinistic
   interpretation, and wholly inapplicable to Arminian views, which are
   neither comfortable nor dangerous, and have never thrust any man 'into
   desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living.' [1212]

   The view here taken is confirmed by the contemporary testimonies
   already quoted, and by the first learned commentator of the Articles,
   Thomas Rogers, who was chaplain to Archbishop Bancroft, and did not
   sympathize with the Puritan party. He draws the following propositions
   from the XVIIth Article, and fortifies them with abundant Scripture
   passages: [1213]

   '1. There is a predestination of men unto everlasting life.

   '2. Predestination hath been from everlasting.

   '3. They who are predestinate unto salvation can not perish.

   '4. Not all men, but certain, are predestinate to be saved.

   '5. In Christ Jesus, of the mere will and purpose of God, some are
   elected, and not others, unto salvation.

   '6. They who are elected unto salvation, if they come unto years of
   discretion, are called both outwardly by the Word and inwardly by the
   Spirit of God.

   '7. The predestinate are both justified by faith, sanctified by the
   Holy Ghost, and shall be glorified in the life to come.

   '8. The consideration of predestination is to the godly-wise most
   comfortable, but to curious and carnal persons very dangerous.

   '9. The general promises of God, set forth in the holy Scriptures, are
   to be embraced of us.

   '10. In our actions, the Word of God, which is his revealed will, must
   be our direction.'

   To this theological comment I add the judgment of an impartial and
   well-informed secular historian. Henry Hallam [1214] declares that the
   Articles on predestination, original sin, and total depravity, 'after
   making every allowance for want of precision, are totally
   irreconcilable with the scheme usually denominated Arminian.' He justly
   appeals in confirmation of this judgment to contemporary and other
   early authorities, and adds: 'Whatever doubts may be raised as to the
   Calvinism of Cranmer and Ridley, there can surely be no room for any as
   to the chiefs of the Anglican Church under Elizabeth. We find explicit
   proofs that Jewel, Nowell, Sandys, and Cox professed to concur with the
   Reformers of Zurich and Geneva in every point of doctrine. The works of
   Calvin and Bullinger became the text-books in the English universities.
   Those who did not hold the predestinarian theory were branded with
   reproach by the name of Free-willers and Pelagians; and when the
   opposite tenets came to be advanced, as they were at Cambridge about
   1590, a clamor was raised as if some unusual heresy had been broached.'

   The Arminian interpretation of the Article under consideration is an
   anachronism and a failure. The Lutheran interpretation is more
   plausible, but true only so far as the Lutheran system is itself
   Augustinian. The Tractarian interpretation, which identifies eternal
   election with ecclesiastical calling, and the elect with the baptized,
   is contrary both to the spirit and letter of the Article. It must in
   all fairness be admitted that Art. XVII., in connection with Arts. X.
   and XIII., implies the infralapsarian scheme, and that the Lambeth
   Articles are not a reaction, but a legitimate though one-sided
   development.

   Note.--The anti-Calvinistic interpretation began after the Synod of
   Dort with Archbishop Laud, or his biographer, Peter Heylin (in his
   Historia Quinqu-Articularis, London, 1660, which was answered and
   refuted by Henry Hickman, in his Historia Quinqu-Articularis
   Exarticulata, 1673). It was maintained, with hesitation, by Waterland
   (1721), more decidedly by Dr. Winchester, d. 1780 (Dissertation on the
   XVIIth Article, new ed. London, 1808); by Dean Kipling (The Articles of
   the Church of England proved not to be Calvinistic, Cambridge, 1802);
   by Bishop Tomline, d. 1827 (A Refutation of Calvinism, London, 1811);
   and, with considerable learning, by Archbishop Laurence, d. 1839
   (Bampt. Lect., Lect. VII. and VIII., Oxford, 1834, 3d ed. 1838), and by
   Hardwick (Hist. of the Articles).

   Laurence and Hardwick, as already remarked, trace Article XVII to
   Lutheran sources, but they overlook the difference between the Lutheran
   system (which admits the Augustinian premises, and even the doctrine of
   unconditional election of grace--see the formula of Concord, ch. xi.)
   and the Arminian system (which denies the Augustinian anthropology, and
   makes both election and reprobation conditional), and show more dislike
   than real knowledge of Calvin. It is little less than a caricature when
   Laurence says of Calvin that his 'love of hypothesis' was superior to
   his great talent and piety (p. 43); that his 'vanity induced him to
   frame a peculiar system of his own' (pp. 262, 263), and that 'no man,
   perhaps, was ever less scrupulous in the adoption of general
   expressions, and no man adopted them with more mental reservations' (p.
   375). Principal Cunningham has exposed this unfairness (The Reformers
   and the Theology of the Reformers, 1866, pp. 179 sqq.).

   Bishop Burnet (who was an Arminian and Latitudinarian) and Bishop
   Browne (a moderate High-Churchman) hesitate between the Augustinian and
   the Arminian interpretation. Burnet, after calmly reviewing the
   different theories of predestination, says (p. 236, Oxford ed.): 'It is
   not to be denied, but that the Article seems to be framed according to
   St. Austin's doctrine: it supposes men to be under a curse and
   damnation, antecedently to predestination, from which they are
   delivered by it; so it is directly against the supralapsarian doctrine;
   nor does the Article make any mention of reprobation--no, not in a
   hint; no definition is made concerning it. The Article does also seem
   to assert the efficacy of grace--that in which the knot of the whole
   difficulty lies is not defined; that is, whether God's eternal purpose
   or decree was made according to what he foresaw his creatures would do,
   or purely upon an absolute will, in order to his own glory. It is very
   probable that those who penned it meant that the decree was absolute;
   but yet since they have not said it, those who subscribe the Articles
   do not seem to be bound to any thing that is not expressed in them;
   and, therefore, since the Remonstrants do not deny but that God having
   foreseen what all mankind would, according to all the different
   circumstances in which they should be put, do or not do, he upon that
   did by a firm and eternal decree lay that whole design in all its
   branches, which he executes in time; they may subscribe this Article
   without renouncing their opinion as to this matter. On the other hand,
   the Calvinists have less occasion for scruple, since the Article does
   seem more plainly to favor them. The three cautions that are added to
   it do likewise intimate that St. Austin's doctrine was designed to be
   settled by the Articles for the danger of men's having the sentence of
   God's predestination always before their eyes, which may occasion
   either desperation on the one hand, or the wretchedness of most unclean
   living on the other, belongs only to that side; since these mischiefs
   do not arise out of the other hypothesis. The other two, of taking the
   promises of God in the sense in which they are set forth to us in holy
   Scriptures, and of following that will of God that is expressly
   declared to us in the Word of God, relate very visibly to the same
   opinion.

   Bishop Browne, after a long discussion, comes to the conclusion (p.
   425) that 'the Article was designedly drawn up in guarded and general
   terms, on purpose to comprehend all persons of tolerably sober views. .
   . . I am strongly disposed to believe that Cranmer's own opinions were
   certainly neither Arminian nor Calvinistic, nor probably even
   Augustinian; yet I can hardly think that he would have so worded this
   Article had he intended to declare very decidedly against either
   explanation of the doctrine of election.'

   Bishop Forbes, a Tractarian, admits the Article to be 'Augustinian, but
   not Calvinistic' (p. 252), and identifies the baptized with the elect,
   saying (p. 254), 'God's predestination is bestowed on every baptized
   Christian. . . . The fact of God bringing men to baptism is synonymous
   with his choosing them in Christ out of mankind.'

   John Wesley, unable to reconcile Art. XVII. with his Arminianism,
   omitted it altogether from his revision of the Articles.

   BAPTISMAL REGENERATION AND FALL FROM GRACE.

   The Articles teach also the possibility of falling away from grace
   (XVI.) and the doctrine of general baptismal regeneration (XXVII.).
   This seems to exclude an absolute decree of election 'to everlasting
   life,' which involves final perseverance as a necessary means to a
   certain end. Hence the attempts to explain away either the one or the
   other in order to save the logical consistency of the formulary. [1215]

   In Article XVI. there is no real difficulty. It is directed against the
   Anabaptists, who 'say they can no more sin,' and the modern Novatians,
   who 'deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent,' and
   accords with a similar article in the Augsburg Confession. [1216] It
   simply teaches the possibility of a temporary fall of the baptized and
   regenerated, but not a total and final fall of the elect, as is clear
   from the addition, 'and by the grace of God we may arise again and
   amend our lives.' This is quite consistent with Augustinianism, and
   even with the most rigorous form of Calvinism. [1217]

   On the subject of baptism the Anglican Church agrees much more with the
   Lutheran than with the Calvinistic creed. She retained the Catholic
   doctrine of baptismal regeneration, but rejected the opus operatum
   theory, and the doctrine that baptism destroys the nature of original
   sin as well as its guilt. Baptismal regeneration is taught indefinitely
   in Article XXVII., [1218] more plainly in the Catechism, [1219] and in
   the baptismal service of the Liturgy, which pronounces every child
   after baptism to be regenerated. [1220]

   This doctrine seems to be contradicted by the undeniable fact that
   multitudes of baptized persons in all churches, especially in those
   where infant baptism is indiscriminately practiced, show no signs of a
   holy life or real change of heart, and belie their baptismal
   engagements.

   To remove this difficulty, some Anglicans take the language of the
   baptismal service, not in a real and literal, but in a hypothetical or
   charitably presumptive meaning. [1221] Others make a distinction
   between baptismal or ecclesiastical regeneration (i.e., incorporation
   into the visible Church) and moral or spiritual regeneration (which
   includes renovation and conversion). Still others distinguish between
   the regenerate and the elect, and thus harmonize Art. XXVII. with Art.
   XVII. Augustine regards the elect as an inner circle of the baptized;
   and holds that, in addition to the baptismal grace of regeneration, the
   elect receive from God the gift of perseverance to the end, which puts
   into execution the eternal and unchangeable decree of election. The
   reason why God grants this grace to some and withholds it from others
   is unknown to us, and must be traced to his inscrutable wisdom. 'Both
   the grace of the beginning,' he says, 'and the grace of persevering to
   the end is not given according to our merits, but according to a most
   secret, just, wise, and beneficent will.' 'Wonderful indeed, very
   wonderful, that to some of his own sons, whom he has regenerated, and
   to whom he has given faith, hope, and charity, God does not give
   perseverance.' [1222]

   Here is a point where Calvin differs from Augustine, at least in logic,
   although they agree in the result--namely, the non-salvation of the
   non-elect, whether baptized or not. Calvin likewise brings baptism into
   close connection with regeneration, [1223] but he draws a sharper
   distinction between the outward visible sign and seal (Rom. iv. 11) and
   the inner invisible grace; he takes moreover a higher view of
   regeneration as a thorough moral renovation, and identifies the truly
   regenerate with the elect. He consequently restricts the regenerating
   efficacy of the Spirit to the elect, and makes it so far independent of
   the sacramental act that it need not always coincide with it, but may
   precede or follow the same. Thus the Westminster Confession calls
   baptism 'a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace, of his [the
   baptized person's] ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of
   remission of sins, and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ,
   to walk in newness of life.' But it adds that 'grace and salvation are
   not so inseparably annexed unto it [baptism], as that no person can be
   regenerated or saved without it (Rom. iv. 11; Acts x. 2, 4, 22, 31, 45,
   47); or, that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated (Acts
   viii. 13, 23). The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that moment of
   time wherein it is administered (John iii. 8): yet, notwithstanding by
   the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only
   offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost to such
   (whether of age, or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to
   the counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time (Gal. iii. 27;
   Tit. iii. 5; Eph. v. 25, 26; Acts ii. 38, 41).' [1224]

   The objection to the Calvinistic view is that it resolves the baptism
   of the non-elect into an empty ceremony (not to say solemn mockery);
   while the Augustinian view turns the baptismal regeneration of the
   non-elect into a failure. The former sacrifices the universality of
   baptismal grace to the particularism of election, the latter sacrifices
   the higher view of regeneration to the claims of baptism. The real
   difficulty of both theories lies in the logical incompatibility of a
   limited election and a universal baptismal grace. The predestinarian
   system and the sacramental system are two distinct lines of thought,
   which neither Augustine nor Calvin have been able satisfactorily to
   adjust and to harmonize.

   NECESSITY OF BAPTISM.

   As to the necessity of baptism for salvation, the Anglican Church at
   first followed, but afterwards softened the rigor of the Augustinian
   and Roman Catholic doctrine, which excludes even unbaptized infants
   dying in infancy from heaven, and assigns them to the limbus infantum,
   on the borders of hell. In the second of the Ten Articles of Henry
   VIII. (1536), it is asserted that 'infants and children dying in
   infancy shall undoubtedly be saved thereby [by baptism], and else not.'
   In the first revision of the Liturgy, the introductory prayer that the
   child may be received by baptism into the ark of Christ's Church
   contains the exclusive clause 'and so saved from perishing.' [1225] But
   in the revision of 1552 this clause was omitted; for Cranmer, who
   framed the Liturgy, had in the mean time changed his opinion, as we may
   infer from the treatise upon the 'Reformation of Ecclesiastical Laws,'
   composed under his superintendency, where the 'scrupulous superstition'
   of the necessity of infant baptism for infant salvation is rejected.
   [1226] This change must be traced to the influence of Zwingli and
   Bullinger, who first boldly asserted that all infants dying before
   committing actual sin, whether baptized or not, whether of Christian or
   heathen parents, are saved in consequence of the universal merit of
   Christ ('propter remedium per Christum exhibitum'), which holds good
   until rejected by unbelief. [1227] Calvin likewise taught the
   possibility of salvation without baptism, but confined it to the elect.
   Thomas Becon (chaplain to Cranmer, and one of the six preachers of
   Canterbury Cathedral, died 1567) is very explicit on this subject. As
   many Jewish children, he says, were saved without circumcision, so many
   Christian children, and even Turks and heathens, may be spiritually
   baptized and saved without water baptism. 'Besides all these things,
   what shall we say of God's election? Can the lack of outward baptism
   destroy and make of none effect the election of God; so that when God
   hath chosen to everlasting salvation, the want of an external sign
   shall cast down into everlasting damnation? . . . As many people are
   saved which never received the sacrament of the body and blood of
   Christ, so likewise are many saved though they were never outwardly
   baptized with water; forasmuch as the regeneration of the Christian
   consisteth rather in the spirit than in the flesh. This text,
   therefore, of Christ, "Except a man be born of water," etc., is to be
   understood of such as may conveniently be baptized, and yet,
   notwithstanding, contemptuously refuse baptism, and despise the
   ordinance of Christ.' [1228] Bishop Jewel says: 'The grace of God is
   not tied to any sacraments. He is able to work salvation both with them
   and without them.' [1229] Hooker is much more cautious and churchly.
   'Predestination,' he says, 'bringeth not to life, without the grace of
   external vocation, wherein our baptism is implied, . . . which both
   declareth and maketh us Christians. In which respect we justly hold it
   to be the door of our actual entrance into God's house; the first
   apparent beginning of life; a seal, perhaps, to the grace of election,
   before received (Calvin, Instit. iv. 15, 22), but to our sanctification
   here a step that hath not any before it. . . . If Christ himself which
   giveth salvation do require baptism (Mark xvi. 16), it is not for us
   that look for salvation to sound and examine him, whether unbaptized
   men may be saved, but seriously to do that which is required, and
   religiously to fear the danger which may grow by want thereof.' Yet,
   touching infants who die unbaptized, he inclines, at least in regard to
   the offspring of Christian parents, to a charitable presumption of 'the
   great likelihood of their salvation,' for the reasons that 'grace is
   not absolutely tied unto sacraments;' that 'God bindeth no man unto
   things altogether impossible;' that 'there is in their Christian
   parents, and in the Church of God, a presumed desire that the sacrament
   of baptism might be given them;' and that 'the seed of faithful
   parentage is holy from the very birth (1 Cor. vii. 14).' [1230]

   The Anglican Church, then, as far as we may infer from her
   authoritative declarations, makes certain the salvation of all baptized
   infants dying in infancy, and leaves the possibility of salvation
   without baptism an open question, with a strong leaning towards the
   liberal view. The Roman Church makes infant salvation without baptism
   impossible; the Lutheran Church makes it at least improbable; the
   Calvinistic Churches make it certain in the case of all the elect,
   without regard to age, and decidedly incline to the charitable belief
   that all children dying in infancy belong to the number of the elect.

   The doctrine of the absolute necessity of baptism for salvation has
   always been based upon two declarations of our Lord, Mark xvi. 16, and
   John iii. 5 (on the assumption that 'water' refers to baptism). But in
   the first passage our Lord, after declaring that faith followed by
   baptism saves, states the negative without adding, and is not baptized;
   intimating by this omission, that only the want of faith or the refusal
   of the gospel, not the want of baptism, condemns. In the discourse with
   Nicodemus he does not say that water baptism is regeneration, nor that
   every one that is born of water is also born of the Spirit (which was
   certainly not the case with Simon Magus, who, notwithstanding his
   baptism, remained 'in the gall of bitterness and the bond of
   iniquity'); he simply lays down two conditions for entering into the
   kingdom of God, and puts the emphasis on being born of the Spirit. This
   is evident from the fact that in that discourse 'water' is mentioned
   but once, but the Spirit four times. The most that can be inferred from
   the two passages is the ordinary necessity of baptism where it can be
   had--that is, within the limits of the Christian Church. We are bound
   to God's ordinances, but God's Spirit is free and 'bloweth where it
   listeth.' We should never forget that the same Lord was the special
   friend of children, and declared them to belong to the kingdom of
   heaven, without any reference to baptism or circumcision, adding these
   significant words, 'It is not the will of your Father who is in heaven
   that one of these little ones should perish' (Matt. xviii. 14).

   THE LORD'S SUPPER.

   If the Articles on Predestination and Baptism leave room for different
   interpretations, there can be no reasonable doubt about the meaning of
   Art. XXVIII. on the Lord's Supper. It clearly teaches the Reformed
   doctrine of the spiritual presence and spiritual eating by faith only,
   in opposition both to transubstantiation and consubstantiation, which
   imply a corporal presence and an oral manducation by all communicants,
   both good and bad, although with opposite effects.

   The wide departure from the Lutheran formularies, otherwise so freely
   consulted, may be seen from the following comparison:

   Augsburg Confession.
   1530.
   Art. X. Thirteen Articles.
   1538.
   Art. VII. Thirty-nine Articles.
   1563 and 1571.
   Art. XXVIII.
   De coena Domini docent, quod corpus et sanguis Christi vere adsint, et
   distribuantur vescentibus in cæna Domini; et improbant secus docentes.
   De Eucharistia constanter credimus et docemus, quod in sacramento
   corporis et sanguinis Domini vere, substantialiter, [1231] et realiter
   adsint corpus et sanguis Christi sub speciebus panis et vini. [1232] Et
   quod sub ejusdem speciebus vere et realiter exhibentur et distribuuntur
   illis qui sacramentum accipiunt, sive bonis sive malis. Corpus Christi
   datur, accipitur, et manducatur tantum coelesti et spirituali ratione
   (only after an heavenly and spiritual manner). Medium, autem quo Corpus
   Christi accipitur et manducatur in coena, fides est (and the mean
   whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is
   faith).

   The clause here quoted from the Elizabethan revision was wanting in the
   Edwardine Articles, and was inserted on motion of Bishop Guest of
   Rochester. [1233] Both series contain the assertion that the bread
   which we break is a communion of the body of Christ 'to such as
   rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same,' which was meant to
   exclude the oral manducation. Both strongly condemn transubstantiation.
   The Edwardine Articles protest also against the Lutheran hypothesis of
   the ubiquity of Christ's body. [1234] This same protest against
   ubiquity is found substantially in the Parker MS. of the Latin revision
   of 1563, but it was struck out in the Convocation. [1235] Instead of it
   a new Article was added in the English revision of 1571, denying that
   the unworthy partake of Christ in the communion. [1236]

   The Catechism likewise limits the reception of Christ's body and blood
   to the 'faithful,' and declares the benefit of the Lord's Supper to be
   'the strengthening and refreshing of our souls.' The communion service
   does not rise above this view, and the distribution formula, inserted
   in the revision of 1552, expresses the commemorative theory. The rubric
   on kneeling, at the close of the service, which was inserted in the
   second Prayer-Book of Edward VI. (1552) by Cranmer, through the
   influence of Hooper and Knox (one of the royal chaplains), [1237] then
   omitted in Elizabeth's reign from regard to the Catholics, but which
   was again restored in the Reign of Charles II. (1662) to conciliate the
   Puritans, explains the kneeling at the communion not to mean an
   adoration of the sacramental bread and wine, or any corporal presence
   of Christ's natural flesh and blood. 'For the natural body and blood of
   Christ are in heaven, and not here; it being against the truth of
   Christ's natural body to be at one time in more places than one.' This
   is a plain declaration against consubstantiation and ubiquity.

   Before the Articles were framed a public disputation on the eucharistic
   presence was held before the royal commissioners at the University of
   Oxford, May, 1549, in which Peter Martyr, then professor of theology,
   defended the figurative interpretation of the words, 'This is my body,'
   and the commemorative character of the ordinance. The acts of the
   disputation were published by Cranmer, with a preface and discourse of
   Peter Martyr. [1238] In June of the same year a disputation on the same
   subject, in which Bucer took part, was held in the University of
   Cambridge. [1239]

   Cranmer, after holding first to transubstantiation, then to
   consubstantiation, adopted at last the Calvinistic theory of a
   spiritual real presence and a spiritual reception by faith only, and
   embodied it in the Articles and the second revision of the Liturgy.
   [1240] He openly confessed this change at a public disputation held in
   London, Dec. 14, 1548, in the Parliament house, 'in the presence of
   almost all the nobility of England.' [1241] He wrote an elaborate
   exposition and defense of his final view against the attacks of
   Gardiner. [1242] He does not allude to Calvin's writings on the
   eucharist, although he can hardly have been ignorant of them, but
   quotes largely from Augustine, Tertullian, Origen, Theodoret, and other
   fathers who seem to favor a figurative interpretation, and approvingly
   mentions Bertram, Berengarius, and Wycliff among mediæval divines, and
   Bucer, Peter Martyr, Zwingli, OEcolampadius among the Reformers, as
   teaching substantially the same doctrine. [1243] He also expressed his
   unqualified approbation of Bullinger's 'Tract on the Sacraments,' which
   was by his desire republished in England (1551) by John à Lasco, to
   whom he remarked that 'nothing of Bullinger's required to be read and
   examined previously.' [1244] But he traced his change directly to
   Bishop Ridley, [1245] and Ridley derived his view not so much from
   Swiss sources as from Bertram (Ratramnus), who, in the middle of the
   ninth century, wrote with great ability against the magical
   transubstantiation theory of Paschasius Radbertus, and in favor of a
   spiritual and dynamic presence. [1246] Cranmer's last utterances on
   this subject, shortly before his condemnation and martyrdom, were made
   in the Oxford disputations with the Romanists to which he, with Ridley
   and Latimer, was summoned from prison, April (and again in September),
   1555. He declared there that Christ's 'true body is truly present to
   them that truly receive him, but spiritually. And so it is taken after
   a spiritual sort. . . . If ye understand by this word "really," re
   ipsa, i.e., in very deed and effectually, so Christ, by the grace and
   efficacy of his passion, is in deed and truly present to all his true
   and holy members. But if ye understand by this word "really"
   corporaliter, i.e., corporally, so that by the body of Christ is
   understanded a natural body and organical, so the first proposition
   doth vary, not only from usual speech and phrase of Scripture, but also
   is clean contrary to the holy Word of God and Christian profession:
   when as both the Scripture doth testify by these words, and also the
   Catholic Church hath professed from the beginning, Christ to have left
   the world, and to sit at the right hand of the Father till he come unto
   judgment.' [1247]

   We add the last confessions of the other two English Reformers at their
   examination in Oxford.

   Bishop Latimer declared 'that there is none other presence of Christ
   required than a spiritual presence; and this presence is sufficient for
   Christian man, as the presence by the which we both abide in Christ,
   and Christ in us to the obtaining of eternal life, if we persevere in
   his true gospel.' [1248]

   Bishop Ridley said: 'I worship Christ in the sacrament, but not because
   he is included in the sacrament: like as I worship Christ also in the
   Scriptures, not because he is really included in them. . . . The body
   of Christ is present in the sacrament, but yet sacramentally and
   spiritually (according to his grace) giving life, and in that respect
   really, that is, according to his benediction, giving life.The true
   Church of Christ doth acknowledge a presence of Christ's body in the
   Lord's Supper to be communicated to the godly by grace, and
   spiritually, as I have often showed, and by a sacramental
   signification, but not by the corporal presence of the body of his
   flesh. [1249]

   REVISION OF THE ARTICLES.

   The Thirty-nine Articles have remained unchanged in England since the
   reign of Elizabeth. The objections of Nonconformists to some of the
   Articles (XXIV., XXV., the affirmative clause of XX., and a portion of
   XXVII) have been removed since 1688 by relaxation and exemption; and
   the difficulties arising from the development of theological schools
   with widely divergent tendencies, within the bosom of the Church of
   England itself, have been met by liberal decisions allowing a great
   latitude of interpretation.

   During the reign of William III., in 1689, a thorough revision of the
   Book of Common Prayer was undertaken and actually made in the interest
   of an agreement with Protestant Dissenters, by an able royal commission
   of ten bishops and twenty divines, including the well-known names of
   Stillingfleet, Patrick, Tillotson, Sharp, Hall, Beveridge, and Tenison.
   But the revision has never been acted upon, and was superseded by the
   toleration granted to Dissenters. The alterations did not extend to the
   Articles directly, but embraced some doctrinal features in the
   liturgical services--namely, the change of the word Priest to
   'Presbyter' or 'Minister;' Sunday to 'Lord's Day;' the omission of the
   Apocryphal Lessons in the calendar of Saints' days, for which chapters
   from Proverbs and Ecclesiastes were substituted, a concession to
   conscientious scruples against kneeling in receiving the sacrament, and
   an addition to the rubric before the Athanasian Creed, stating that
   'the condemning clauses are to be understood as relating only to those
   who obstinately deny the substance of the Christian faith. [1250]

   other hand, the Articles have no place in any collection of Lutheran
   symbols; still less, of course, could they be included among Greek or
   Latin symbols.

   [1190] The modification of the royal supremacy in Art. XXXVII., as
   compared with Art XXXVI. of Edward, was intended to meet the scruples
   of Romanists and Calvinists. Nevertheless this article, and the two
   acts of supremacy and uniformity, form the basis of that restrictive
   code of laws which pressed so heavily for more than two centuries upon
   the consciences of Roman Catholic and Protestant dissenters. Comp. the
   third chapter of Hallam's Constitutional History of England (Harper's
   ed. pp. 71 sqq.).

   [1191] The same passage occurs in the Reformatio Legum ecclesiasticarum
   (De Summa Trinitate, c. 2), a work prepared by a committee consisting
   of Cranmer, Peter Martyr, and six others, 1551. It was edited by
   Cardwell, Oxford, 1850, and serves as a commentary on the Articles. See
   Hardwick, pp. 82 and 371.

   Laurence (Bampton Lectures, pp. 40 and 233 sqq.) first discovered and
   pointed out this resemblance. Hardwick (pp. 126 sqq.) and the
   'Interleaved Prayer-Book' speak of the Confession of Brentius
   alternately as the 'Saxon' Confession, and the 'Würtemberg' (or
   Wirtemburg!) Confession, as if the Saxon city of Wittenberg and the
   Duchy (now Kingdom) of Würtemberg were one and the same. The 'Saxon
   Confession,' so called, or the 'Repetition of the Augsburg Confession,'
   is a different document, written about the same time and for the same
   purpose by Melanchthon, in behalf of the Wittenberg and other Saxon
   divines. See above, p. 340, and the Oxford Sylloge, which incorporates
   the Saxon but not the Würtemberg Confession.

   [1196] One of the last letters of Cranmer was written from his prison,
   1555, to Peter Martyr, who was a decided Calvinist. See Zurich Letters,
   First Series, Vol. I. p. 29.

   [1197] See above, p. 474.

   [1198] Zurich Letters, First Series, Vol. I. p. 325.

   [1199] From this we might infer that Melanchthon's influence, in
   consequence of his abandonment of absolute predestinarianism, was
   declining in England, while Calvin's was increasing.

   [1200] He means the Consensus Genevensis de æterna Dei prædestinatione,
   which appeared in 1552, and acquired semi-symbolical authority in
   Geneva. Calvin had also previously (1543) written a tract against
   Pighius on the doctrine of free-will, and dedicated it to Melanchthon,
   who gratefully acknowledged the compliment, but modestly intimated his
   dissent and his inability to harmonize the all-ruling providence of God
   with the action of the human will. See Stähelin, Calv. Vol. I. p. 241.

   [1201] Zurich Letters, First Series, Vol. I. p. 327. Bullinger's tract
   De providentia, which was occasioned by Traheron, is still extant in
   MS. in Zurich, and is fully noticed by Schweizer. See above, p. 475.

   [1202] On Bullinger's intimate personal relations with English divines,
   which began before the reign of Edward and continued till his death
   (1575), compare Pestalozzi's Heinrich Bullinger, pp. 441 sqq.

   fourth century, who followed the Emperor Julian in his apostasy.

   [1205] Ibid. Vol. II. p. 97. Brentius advocated the absolute ubiquity
   of Christ's body, and fiercely attacked the Reformed in several tracts,
   from 1560 to 1564 (ten years after he wrote the Würtemberg Confession).
   He was answered by Bullinger and Peter Martyr. See above, p. 290.

   [1206] See his letter to his revered teacher, Peter Martyr, p. 603.
   Grindal called him after his death (Sept. 22, 1571), 'the jewel and
   singular ornament of the Church, as his name implies.'--Zurich Letters,
   Second Series, Vol. I. p. 260. An adversary, Moren, said of him : 'I
   should love thee, Jewel, if thou wert not a Zwinglian; in thy faith I
   hold thee an heretic, but surely in thy life thou art an angel.' Queen
   Elizabeth ordered a copy of Jewel's 'Apology of the Church of England'
   (1562) to be chained in every parish church.

   [1207] The insertion 'in Christ' is Scriptural and in accordance with
   all the Reformed Confessions. There is no election out of Christ or
   apart from Christ.

   [1208] With the exception of an incidental allusion to the absolute
   freedom of divine grace in the Augsburg Confession, Art. V., De
   Ministerio: 'Per verbum et sacramenta tamquam per instrumenta donatur
   Spiritus Sanctus, qui fidem efficit, ubi et quando visum est Deo, in
   iis qui audiunt evangelium.' Compare with this the expression of the
   Form. Concordiæ (Sol. decl. Art. II. de lib. arbitr. p. 673): 'Trahit
   Deus hominem, quem convertere decrevit.' It is significant that in the
   altered edition of 1540 Melanchthon omitted the words ubi et quando
   visum est Deo,' as also the words 'non adjuvante Deo' in Art. XIX. The
   brevity of allusion shows that even in 1530, although still holding to
   the Augustinian scheme, he laid less stress on it than in the first
   edition of his Loci. This appears also from a letter to Brentius, Sept.
   30, 1531 (Corp. Ref. Vol. II. p. 547), where Melanchthon says: 'Sed ego
   in tota Apologia fugi illam longam et inexplicabilem disputationem de
   prædestinatione. Ubique sic loquor, quasi prædestinatio sequatur
   nostram fidem et opera.'

   [1209] See above, pp. 262 sqq., and Schweizer, Centraldogmen, Vol. I.
   p. 384. There is not a trace of synergism in the XVIIth Art, and Art.
   X. expressly denies the freedom of will, while Melanchthon asserts it
   in the later editions of his Loci ('Liberum arbitrium esse in homine
   facultatem applicandi se ad gratiam'). Laurence (p. 179) and Hardwick
   (p. 383) derive the last clause about the 'general' promises and the
   'revealed will' from Melanchthon, but the same sentiments are found in
   Calvin, Bullinger, and the Reformed Confessions. See below.

   [1210] This element of caution and modesty is well expressed by Bishop
   Ridley: 'In these matters [of God's election] I am so fearful that I
   dare not speak further, yea, almost none otherwise than the very text
   doth, as it were, lead me by the hand.' Ridley's Works (Parker ed.), p.
   368. He thus wrote in a letter of sympathy to his friend and chaplain,
   Bradford, who in prison, at London, had a dispute with a certain
   'free-willer,' Henry Hart, and wrote an excellent 'Defense of
   Election.' This treatise was approved by his fellow-prisoners, and
   shows what an unspeakable comfort they derived from this doctrine. See
   The Writings of John Bradford, Martyr, 1555 (Parker Soc. ed.), pp. 307
   sqq.

   [1212] Dr. Cunningham (The Reformers and the Theology of the
   Reformation, p. 194), says: 'It is only the Calvinistic, and not the
   Arminian doctrine that suggests or requires such guards or caveats; and
   it is plainly impossible that such a statement could ever have occurred
   to the compilers of the Articles as proper and necessary, unless they
   had been distinctly aware that they had just laid down a statement
   which at least included the Calvinistic doctrine.'

   labors to show that inasmuch as the founders of the Church of England
   were Calvinists, they can not have held the Tractarian doctrine of
   baptismal regeneration, which is incompatible with Calvinism.
   Archdeacon Wilberforce, who afterwards seceded to Rome, showed, in his
   Doctrine of Holy Baptism (London, 1849), in opposition to Goode, that
   the formularies of the Church of England do clearly teach baptismal
   regeneration. J. B. Mozley, B.D., Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford,
   in his able work on The Primitive Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration
   (London, 1856), takes a middle ground, viz., that the Church of England
   imposes the doctrine 'that God gives regenerating grace to the whole
   body of the baptized,' and tolerates the doctrine 'that God gives grace
   sufficient for salvation only to some of this body' and 'that these two
   positions can not really be in collision with each other, though
   apparently they are.' Mozley grapples with the difficulties of the
   problem, but has after all not succeeded in making it clear.

   [1216] Comp. Augs. Conf., Art. XII.: 'Damnant Anabaptistas, qui negant
   semel justificatos posse amittere Spiritum Sanctum. . . . Damnantur et
   Novatiani qui nolebant absolvere lapsos post baptismum redeuntes ad
   poenitentiam.' Also Bullinger's Confes. Helv., cap. XIV.: 'Damnamus et
   veteres et novos Novatianos, atque Catharos.'

   [1217] See the defense of this Article by Dean Bridges, of Sarum,
   quoted by Hardwick, p. 211.

   [1218] 'Baptism is . . . a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby,
   as by an instrument, they that receive baptism rightly, are grafted
   into the Church.' The language of this Article bears a Reformed or
   Calvinistic interpretation. Bishop Hooper and several of the Marian
   exiles were Zwinglians, but the views of Cranmer and Ridley, in their
   private writings, on the effects of baptism and baptismal grace, agree
   substantially with those of Luther. See Browne on Art. XXVII. pp. 668
   sq.; the passages collected by Jones, Expos. of the Art. pp. 157 sqq.;
   also Hardwick, pp. 393-395.

   [1219] The second question: 'Who gave you this name? Ans. My godfather
   and godmother in baptism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, the
   child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.'

   [1220] After the public baptism of infants, the priest shall say:
   'Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate,
   and grafted into the body of Christ's Church, let us give thanks to
   Almighty God for these benefits,' etc. And in the prayer which follows:
   'We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath
   pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive
   him for thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy
   holy Church.' The same prayer is prescribed for the office of private
   baptism of infants. The baptismal service is derived from the Sarum
   Manual and from the 'Consultation' of Archbishop Hermann of Cologne,
   which was borrowed from Luther's Taufbüchlein. See Daniel, Cod. Liturg.
   Eccl. Luth. p. 185, and Procter, History of the Book of Common Prayer,
   p. 371, 11th ed. (1874). Among the eight particulars in the
   Prayer-Book, which Baxter and his Nonconformist brethren objected to as
   sinful, the fourth was 'that ministers be forced to pronounce all
   baptized infants to be regenerate by the Holy Ghost, whether they be
   the children of Christians or not' (Procter, p. 133). The last clause
   intimates that baptized children of Christian parents were regarded by
   them as regenerate.

   [1221] So Mozley, who endeavors to fasten this meaning upon the
   fathers, and the standard Anglican writers, including Hooker. But the
   strong language of the Greek and Latin fathers, who almost identify
   baptism with regeneration, and seem to know no other regeneration but
   that by baptism (which they call anagennesis, palingenesia,
   theogenesis, photismos, regeneratio, secunda nativitas, renascentia,
   illuminatio), must be understood chiefly of adult baptism, which in the
   first four centuries of the Church was the rule, while infant baptism
   was the exception, and which was administered to such only as had
   passed through a course of catechetical instruction, and professed
   repentance and faith in Christ. The same is true of the passages of the
   New Testament on baptism.

   [1222] See his tract De dono perseverantiæ, and Mozley's Treatise on
   the Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination (Lond. 1855), pp. 191 sqq.,
   and the Primitive Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration, pp. 113 sqq.
   Mozley thinks that Augustine means by baptismal regeneration only
   capacity for goodness and holiness. Browne (on Art. XXVII.) presents a
   somewhat different view, viz., that Augustine uses the term
   regeneration sometimes in a wider, sometimes in a stricter and deeper
   sense. 'At one time he speaks of all the baptized as regenerate in
   Christ, and made children of God by virtue of that sacrament; at
   another time he speaks of baptismal grace as rather enabling them to
   become, than as actually constituting them God's children; and says
   that, in the higher and stricter sense, persons are not to be called
   sons of God unless they have the grace of perseverance, and walk in the
   love of God' (p. 660). There is no doubt that Augustine wished to
   adhere to the traditional orthodox view of baptism, and yet he could
   not help seeing that his new doctrine of predestination required a
   modification, which, however, he did not fully and clearly carry out.

   [1223] This is undoubtedly the case in the New Testament wherever
   Christian baptism is mentioned: John iii. 5; Acts ii. 38; Rom. vi. 3,
   4; Gal. iii. 27; Col. ii. 12; Eph. v. 26; Tit. iii. 5; 1 Pet. iii. 21.
   Calvin's exposition of some of these passages in his commentaries
   should be compared with his teaching in the 'Institutes.'

   [1224] Chap. xxviii. 1, 5, 6.

   [1225] Borrowed from the Lutheran service composed by Melanchthon and
   Bucer for Cologne: 'That being separated from the number of the
   ungodly, he may be kept safe in the holy ark of thy Church (in sancta
   Ecclesiæ, tuæ Arca tutus servari possit).' See Laurence, p. 71;
   Procter, p. 374. The Augsburg Confession (Art. IX., Latin ed.) teaches
   quod baptismus sit necessarius ad salutem, and condemns the Anabaptists
   for teaching that infants may be saved without baptism.

   [1226] Reformat. Leg., De Baptismo: 'Illorum etiam videri debet
   scrupulosa superstitio, qui Dei gratiam et Spiritum Sanctum tantopere
   cum sacramentorum elementis colligant, ut plane affirment, nullum
   Christianorum infantem salutem esse consecuturum, qui prius morte
   fuerit occupatus, quam ad Baptismum adduci potuerit; quod longe secus
   habere judicamus.'

   [1227] See above, p. 378. Zwingli was not quite so positive about the
   salvation of heathen children, but he declared it at least 'probabilius
   ut gentium liberi per Christum salventur quam ut damnentur.' Bullinger
   held the same view, though not so clearly expressed. See the passages
   quoted by Laurence, pp. 266, 267, who agrees on this subject with the
   Zurich Reformers.

   Augsburg Conf., Art. X.

   [1232] Sub speciebus panis et vini, from the German edition of the
   Augsburg Conf. (unter Gestalt des Brotes und Weines).

   [1233] This is inferred from a letter to Cecil, Dec. 22, 1566, where
   Guest justifies the use of the word 'only' by saying that he did not
   intend to exclude 'the presence of Christ's body from the sacrament,
   but only the grossness and sensibleness in the receiving thereof.'
   Hardwick, p. 130.

   [1234] 'Forasmuch as the truth of man's nature requireth that the body
   of one and the self-same man can not be at one time in diverse places,
   but must needs be in some one certain place: therefore the body of
   Christ can not be present at one time in many and diverse places. And
   because (as holy Scripture doth teach) Christ was taken up into heaven,
   and there shall continue unto the end of the world, a faithful man
   ought not either to believe or openly to confess the real and bodily
   presence (as they term it) of Christ's flesh and blood, in the
   sacrament of the Lord's Supper.'

   [1235] Hardwick regards this omission as a protest against
   Zwinglianism. But the leading Elizabethan bishops, especially Horn,
   Jewel, and Grindal, assure Bullinger and Peter Martyr of their full
   agreement with them against the ubiquitarian hypothesis, which was at
   that time defended by Brentius and Andreae, and opposed by the Swiss.
   See pp. 603 and 632.

   [1236] Art. XXIX. 'Of the wicked which do not eat the body of Christ in
   the use of the Lord's Supper. The wicked, and such as be void of a
   lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their
   teeth (as St. Augustine saith) the sacrament [i.e., the sacramental
   sign] of the body and blood of Christ: yet in no way are they partakers
   of Christ, but rather to their condemnation do eat and drink the sign
   or sacrament of so great a thing.' This Article is wanting in the Latin
   edition of 1563, having probably been withdrawn from the Convocation
   records in compliance with the desire of the Queen and her council to
   deal gently with the adherents of the 'old learning' (whether Romish or
   Lutheran); but it was inserted in the Latin editions after the year
   1571. See Hardwick, pp. 144 and 315.

   Papist, then a Lutheran, and at last a Zwinglian. 'After it hath
   pleased God,' he says, 'to show unto me, by his holy Word, a more
   perfect knowledge of his Son Jesus Christ, from time to time as I grew
   in knowledge of him, by little and little I put away my former
   ignorance. And as God of his mercy gave me light, so through his grace
   I opened mine eyes to receive it, and did not willfully repugn unto God
   and remain in darkness. And I trust in God's mercy and pardon for my
   former errors, because I erred but of frailness and ignorance.' Answer
   to Smith's Preface, Works, Vol. I. p. 374.

   [1241] Of this recantation Bartholomew Traheron wrote to Bullinger from
   London, Dec. 31, 1548, as follows: 'I can not refrain, my excellent
   Bullinger, from acquainting you with circumstances that have lately
   given us the greatest pleasure, that you and your fellow-ministers may
   participate in our enjoyment. On the 14th of December, if I mistake
   not, a disputation was held at London concerning the eucharist, in the
   presence of almost all the nobility of England. The argument was
   sharply contested by the Bishops. The Archbishop of Canterbury,
   contrary to general expectation, most openly, firmly, and learnedly
   maintained your opinion upon this subject. His arguments were as
   follows: The body of Christ was taken up from us into heaven. Christ
   has left the world. "Ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have
   not always," etc. Next followed the Bishop of Rochester [Ridley], who
   handled the subject with so much eloquence, perspicuity, erudition, and
   power, as to stop the mouth of that most zealous papist, the Bishop of
   Worcester [Heath]. The truth never obtained a more brilliant victory
   among us. I perceive that it is all over with Lutheranism, now that
   those who were considered its principal and almost only supporters have
   altogether come over to our side. We are much indebted to the Lord who
   provides for us also in this particular.' In a postscript to this
   letter, John of Ulmis adds: 'The foolish Bishops have made a marvelous
   recantation.' The same 'notable disputation of the sacrament' is
   mentioned in King Edward's Journal as having taken place in the
   Parliament house. See Zurich Letters, 1537-1558, pp. 322, 323.

   [1246] Bishop Browne correctly says (p. 710): 'Ridley, indeed, refused
   to take the credit of converting Cranmer, but Cranmer himself always
   acknowledged his obligations to Ridley.' In his last examination at
   Oxford, before Bishop Brooks of Gloucester (Sept., 1555), Cranmer said
   that 'Doctor Ridley, by sundry persuasions and authorities drew me
   quite from my opinion' (on the real presence). Works, Vol. II. p. 218.
   Brooks on the same occasion remarked: 'Latimer leaneth to Cranmer.
   Cranmer to Ridley, and Ridley to the singularity of his own wit;' to
   which Ridley replied, that this was 'most untrue, in that he was but a
   young scholar in comparison of Master Cranmer.' Ridley's Works, pp.

   fully in his controversy with Harding, Works, Vol. I. pp. 448 sqq.

   luminaries of the Church of England (naming Mede, Andrewes, Hooker,
   Taylor, Hammond, Cosin, Bramhall, Ussher, Pearson, Patrick, Bull,
   Beveridge, Wake, Waterland) agree with the doctrine of the formularies
   in denying a corporal and acknowledging a spiritual feeding in the
   Supper of the Lord.

   Commons, Dec., 1927, by a vote of 238 to 205. A second revision was
   rejected by the Commons, June 14, 1928, by an increased majority, 266
   to 220. The revision seemed to permit the reservation of the sacrament
   and introduced after the consecration of the elements the epiclesis of
   the Greek Church, stating the change of the bread and wine. The Revised
   Book is issued by the S. P. C. K.--Ed.

   The members of the Church of England in the American Colonies, from the
   first settlement of Virginia (1607) till after the War of the
   Revolution, belonged to the diocese of the Bishop of London, who never
   visited the country, and could exercise but an imperfect supervision.
   Several attempts were made, by the friends of the Church, to establish
   colonial bishoprics, but failed.

   The separation from the crown of England necessitated an independent
   organization, which assumed the title of The Protestant Episcopal
   Church in the United States of America. The first steps towards such an
   organization were taken by a meeting of clergy and laity in New
   Brunswick, New Jersey, May 11, 1784, and by another and larger one,
   held in New York, Oct. 6 and 7, of the same year. The first General
   Convention, consisting of sixteen clerical and twenty-six lay deputies,
   assembled in Philadelphia, Sept. 27 and 28, 1785, Dr. White presiding,
   adopted a constitution and such changes in the Book of Common Prayer as
   were deemed necessary to conform it 'to the American Revolution and the
   Constitutions of the respective States,' and petitioned the English
   hierarchy to consecrate such bishops for the independent Church as may
   be elected by the separate dioceses. [1251] The revised provisional
   Liturgy was rather hastily prepared and published, 1786. It is called
   the 'Proposed Book.' [1252] It contains, besides many necessary ritual
   changes and improvements, Twenty Articles of Religion, based upon the
   Thirty-nine Articles, but differing widely from them, being a
   mutilation rather than an improvement. [1253] The alterations and
   omissions were made in the interest of an unchurchly latitudinarianism
   which then prevailed. The Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed, which
   Art. VIII. of the English series acknowledges, were entirely omitted in
   Art. IV. of the new series; the Apostles' Creed was retained, but
   without the clause 'He descended into hell.'

   The book failed to give general satisfaction at home or abroad. The
   English Archbishops demanded the restoration of the three OEcumenical
   Creeds in their integrity. [1254]

   The General Convention held at Wilmington, Del., Oct. 11, 1786,
   complied with this request so far as the Nicene Creed and the
   discretionary use of the clause of the descent in the Apostles' Creed
   were concerned. [1255] The omission of the Athanasian Creed was adhered
   to, [1256] and subsequently acquiesced in by the English Bishops. The
   obstacle of the oath of allegiance required in England having been
   removed by act of Parliament, the Rev. Drs. White, of Pennsylvania, and
   Provoost, of New York, received the long-sought 'Apostolical
   succession,' in the chapel of Lambeth Palace, Feb. 4, 1787. At one time
   this result seemed so doubtful that steps were taken to secure
   ordination, with a broken succession, from the Lutheran bishops of
   Denmark, and the consent of the Danish government had actually been
   obtained, when the difficulties in England were removed.

   In the Special Convention of Philadelphia, June, 1799 (the General
   Convention having been prevented in the preceding year by an epidemic),
   a new revision of the Articles of Religion, reduced to seventeen, was
   considered, but not finally acted upon by the House of Deputies, and
   was printed as an Appendix to the Journal of that House. [1257] But it
   gave no satisfaction, and shared the same fate with the previous draft
   of twenty Articles.

   Finally, the General Convention held at Trenton, New Jersey, Sept.
   3-12, 1801, settled the question by adopting the Thirty-nine Articles
   in the form which they have since retained in the American Episcopal
   Church, and are incorporated in its editions of the Prayer-Book. [1258]
   The only doctrinal difference is the omission of the Athanasian Creed
   from Art. VIII.; the remaining changes are political, and adapted to
   the separation of Church and State. Otherwise even 'the obsolete
   diction' is retained. The following is the action of this Convention:
   [1259]

   'Resolutions of the Bishops, the Clergy, and the Laity of the
   Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in
   Convention, in the city of Trenton, the 12th day of September, in the
   year of our Lord 1801, respecting the Articles of Religion.

   'The Articles of Religion are hereby ordered to be set forth with the
   following directions, to be observed in all future editions of the
   same; that is to say--

   'The following to be the title, viz.:

   '"Articles of Religion, as established by the Bishops, the Clergy, and
   the Laity of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of
   America, in Convention, on the 12th day of September, in the year of
   our Lord 1801."

   'The Articles to stand as in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of
   England, with the following alterations and omissions, viz.:

   'In the 8th Article, the word "three" in the title, and the words
   "three--Athanasius' creed" in the Article, to be omitted, and the
   Article to read thus:

   '"Art. VIII. Of the Creeds.

   '"The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles'
   Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed, for they may be
   proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture."

   'Under the title "Article 21," the following note to be inserted,
   namely,

   '"The 21st of the former Articles is omitted, because it is partly of a
   local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the remaining parts
   of it, in other Articles."

   'The 35th Article to be inserted with the following note, namely,

   '"This Article is received in this Church, so far as it declares the
   Books of Homilies to be an explication of Christian doctrine, and
   instructive in piety and morals. But all references to the constitution
   and laws of England are considered as inapplicable to the circumstances
   of this Church: which also suspends the order for the reading of said
   homilies in churches until a revision of them may conveniently be made,
   for the clearing of them, as well from obsolete words and phrases, as
   from the local references."

   'The 36th Article, entitled "Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers,"
   to read thus:

   '"The Book of Consecration of Bishops, and ordering of Priests and
   Deacons, as set forth by the General Convention of this Church in 1792,
   doth contain all things necessary to such consecration and ordering:
   neither hath it any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and
   ungodly. And, therefore, whosoever are consecrated or ordered according
   to said form, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully
   consecrated and ordered."

   'The 37th Article to be omitted, and the following substituted in its
   place:

   '"Art. XXXVII. Of the Power of the Civil Magistrate.

   '"The power of the civil magistrate extendeth to all men, as well
   Clergy as Laity, in all things temporal; but hath no authority in
   things purely spiritual. And we hold it to be the duty of all men who
   are professors of the gospel, to pay respectful obedience to the civil
   authority, regularly and legitimately constituted." [1260]

   'Adopted by the House of Bishops.

   WILLIAM WHITE, D.D., Presiding Bishop.

   'Adopted by the House of Clerical and Lay Deputies.

   ABRAHAM BEACH, D.D., President.

   On the nature and aim of this action, Bishop White remarks: [1261]

   'The object kept in view, in all the consultations held, and the
   determinations formed, was the perpetuating of the Episcopal Church, on
   the ground of the general principles which she had inherited from the
   Church of England; and of not departing from them, except so far as
   either local circumstances required, or some very important cause
   rendered proper. To those acquainted with the system of the Church of
   England, it must be evident that the object here stated was
   accomplished on the ratification of the Articles.'

   The only change in the Prayer-Book which has a doctrinal bearing,
   besides the omission of the Athanasian Creed, is the insertion of the
   Prayer of Oblation and Invocation from the Scotch (and the First
   Edwardine) Prayer-Book, through the influence of Bishop Seabury, who
   had been consecrated in the Scotch Episcopal Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1251] Shortly before the Convention, Bishop Seabury, of Connecticut,
   had received consecration at Aberdeen from three Bishops of Scotland
   (Nov. 14, 1784), but he did not attend the Convention, and was opposed
   from High-Church principles to the introduction of lay representation
   and the limitation of the power of the episcopate.

   [1252] It is sometimes also called 'Bishop White's Prayer-Book,' who
   was the chairman of the committee of revision, Dr. William Smith, of
   Maryland, and Dr. Wharton, of Delaware, being the other members. Smith
   is made chiefly responsible for the changes by Perry, p. 23. The book
   was printed in Philadelphia, 1786, in London, 1789, and again (with
   omission of the amended Articles of Religion) in New York, Dec., 1873,
   for provisional use in the new Reformed Episcopal Church,' which has
   since adopted a new revision.

   [1253] Given by Perry, Hand-book, pp. 34-39, from the original MSS. in
   the Convention archives. He calls the Proposed Book a 'hasty, crude,
   and unsatisfactory compilation, which failed utterly to establish
   itself in the American Church' (p. 42).

   [1254] See their letter in Perry, pp. 50-55.

   [1255] In the first edition of the new Prayer-Book, 1790, the
   objectionable clause was printed in italics, and put in parentheses.
   But the General Convention of 1792 left it discretionary to use it, or
   to omit it, or to substitute for it the words, 'He went into the place
   of departed spirits,' as being equivalent to the words in the Creed.

   [1256] Bishop Seabury was very zealous for the Athanasian Creed; and in
   the Convention of 1789 the House of Bishops agreed to its permissory
   use, but the House of Deputies 'would not allow of the Creed in any
   shape.' Bishop White favored a compromise--viz., to leave it in the
   Prayer-Book as a doctrinal document, but not to read it in public

   § 83. The Catechisms of the Church of England. A.D. 1549 and 1662.

   Literature.

   The Church Catechism is contained in all the English and American
   editions of the Book of Common Prayer, between the baptismal and the
   confirmation services, and is printed in this work with the American
   emendations, Vol. III. pp. 517 sqq. The authentic text of the final
   revision of 1662 is in the corrected copy of the Black-Letter
   Prayer-Book, which was attached to the Act of Uniformity, and has been
   republished in fac-simile, Lond. 1871. (It was supposed to be lost,
   when in 1867 it was discovered in the Library of the House of Lords.)

   EARLIER CATECHISMS.

   The English Church followed the example of the Lutheran and Reformed
   Churches on the Continent in providing for regular catechetical
   instruction. English versions and expositions of the Lord's Prayer, the
   Creed, and the Ten Commandments, with some prayers, were known before
   the Reformation, and constituted the 'Prymer,' which is commonly
   mentioned in the fifteenth century as a well-known book of private
   devotion. [1262] In 1545 Henry VIII. set forth a Primer which was 'to
   be taught, learned, and read, and none other to be used throughout all
   his dominions. [1263] During his reign the curates were frequently
   enjoined to teach the people the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten
   Commandments, sentence by sentence, on Sundays and Holydays, and to
   make all persons recite them when they came to confession.

   CRANMER'S CATECHISM.

   'Cranmer's Catechism,' which appeared with his sanction in 1548, was
   for the most part a translation of the Latin Catechism of Justus Jonas,
   and retains the Catholic and Lutheran consolidation of the first and
   second commandments, and the sacrament of penance or absolution; but it
   was soon superseded. [1264] Cranmer changed about that time his view of
   the real presence.

   THE CATECHISM OF THE PRAYER-BOOK.

   When the Reformation was positively introduced under Edward VI., and
   the Book of Public Worship was prepared, a Catechism was embodied in
   it, to insure general instruction in the elements of the Christian
   religion. In the Prayer-Books of Edward VI. (1549, 1552) and Elizabeth
   (1559) this Catechism bears the title 'Confirmation, wherein is
   contained a Catechism for Children.'

   This work has undergone, with other parts of the Prayer-Book, sundry
   alterations. The commandments were given, first very briefly (as in
   King Henry's Primer), then in full with a Preface in the edition of
   1552. The explanation of the sacraments was added in 1604 by royal
   authority, in compliance with the wish of the Puritans expressed at the
   Hampton Court Conference, [1265] and is attributed to Bishop Overall,
   then Dean of St. Paul's. In the last revision of the Prayer-Book, in
   1661, the title was changed into 'A Catechism,' and two emendations
   were introduced in the answer on Baptism, as follows:

   Earlier Editions. Edition of 1661 (1662)
   What is the outward visible sign or form in Baptism? What is the
   outward visible sign or form in Baptism?
   Water; wherein the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled with it, in
   the name, etc. Water; wherein the person is baptized, in the name, etc.
   Why then are infants baptized when by reason of their tender age they
   can not perform them [repentance and faith]? Why then are infants
   baptized, when by reason of their tender age they can not perform them?
   Yes; they do perform them by their Sureties, who promise and vow them
   both in their names: which when they come to age themselves are bound
   to perform. Because they promise them both by their Sureties; which
   promise, when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform.


   In the explanation of the Commandments the words 'the King and his
   Ministers' were so changed as to read 'the King and all that are put in
   authority under him.'

   This Catechism is a considerable improvement on the mediæval primers,
   but very meagre if we compare it with the Catechisms of Luther, Calvin,
   and other Continental Reformers.

   The Nonconformist ministers at the Savoy Conference (April, 1661), in
   reviewing the whole Liturgy, objected to the first three questions of
   the Catechism, and desired a full exposition of the Lord's Prayer, the
   Creed, and the Commandments, and additional questions on the nature of
   faith, repentance, the two covenants, justification, adoption,
   regeneration, and sanctification. These censures were not heeded.
   [1266]

   The American Episcopal Church adopted, with the body of the Book of
   Common Prayer, the Catechism also, substituting 'the civil authority'
   for 'the King,' and omitting several directions in the appended
   rubrics.

   Outside of the Anglican communion the Catechism is used only by the
   Irvingites who more nearly approach that Church, especially in their
   liturgy, than any other.

   LARGER CATECHISMS.

   The need of a fuller Catechism for a more advanced age was felt in the
   Church of England. Such a one was prepared by Poynet, Bishop of
   Winchester, and published, together with the Forty-two Articles, in
   Latin and English, in 1553, [1267] apparently with the approval of
   Cranmer and the Convocation. [1268] On the basis of this, Dean Nowell,
   of St. Paul's, prepared another in 1562, which was amended, but not
   formally approved by Convocation (Nov. 11, 1562), and published (1570)
   in several forms--larger, middle, and smaller. The smaller differs but
   slightly from that in the Prayer-Book. [1269]

   Besides these English productions, the Catechisms of OEcolampadius, Leo
   Judæ, and especially those of Calvin and Bullinger were extensively
   used, even in the Universities, during the reign of Elizabeth. [1270]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1262] The earliest known copy, belonging to the latter part of the
   14th century, has been published by Maskel in Monumenta ritualia
   Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ, Vol. II. It contains Matins and Hours of our Lady;
   Evensong and Compline; the seven Penitential Psalms; the Psalmi
   graduales (Psa. CXX.-CXXXIV.); the Litany; Placebo (Vespers); Dirge
   (the office for the departed); the Psalms of Commendation; Pater
   noster; Ave Maria; Creed; Ten Commandments; the seven deadly sins. See
   Procter, p. 15.

   [1263] It contained, besides the contents of the older Primers, the
   Salutation of the Angel, the Passion of our Lord, and several prayers.
   See Procter, p. 15, and Barton, Three Primers, pp. 437 sqq.

   [1264] So Hardwick (Hist. of the Reform. p. 194) and other Episcopal
   writers. This matter needs further investigation. The very existence of
   a Catechism of Jonas is doubted by Langemack and Mönckeberg, who have
   written with authority on Luther's Catechism. But it is a fact that
   Luther, before be prepared his own Catechisms (1529), charged with this
   task his colleagues and friends Justus Jonas and Agricola of Eisleben
   (who afterwards became the leader of Antinomian views in opposition to
   Luther), for he wrote to Hausmann, Feb. 2, 1525: 'Jonæ et Eislebio
   mandatas est catechismus puerorum parandus' (De Wette, Vol. II. p.
   621). This is probably the Catechism which appeared in the same year in
   a Latin translation anonymously under the title 'Quo pacto statim a
   primis annis, pueri debeant in Christianismo institui. Libellus
   perutilis.' At the close: 'Impressum Wittembergæ per Georgium Rhaw. An.
   1525.' The original German edition has not been traced, but Dr.
   Schneider has discovered a copy of an improved German edition, under
   the title 'Ein Buchlein fur die kinder gebessert und gemehret. Der
   Leyen Biblia. Wittemberg, 1528,' and has reproduced it in the appendix
   to his critical edition of Luther's Small Catechism, 1853. He leaves
   it, however, uncertain whether it was composed by Jonas. Comp. his
   Introduction, pp. xx sqq. It consists of a brief exposition of the Ten
   Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, the Sacrament of Baptism,
   and the Lord's Supper, with an addition on Confession; and so far it
   anticipates the order of Luther's Catechism. This must be the basis of
   Cranmer's Catechism; but as the Parker Soc. edition of his works gives
   only his dedicatory Preface to King Edward (Vol. II. p. 418), I can not
   verify the identity. It seems strange that Cranmer did not translate
   rather the far more perfect Catechism of Luther. The reason was, no
   doubt, his personal acquaintance with the author's son, Justus Jonas,
   jun., who was recommended to him by Melanchthon, was very kindly
   treated by him, and seems to have been the chief medium of his
   communication with the German Lutherans. See Strype's Memoir of
   Cranmer, Vol. II. p. 581; Laurence, p. 17; and Cranmer's Works, Vol.
   II. p. 425.

   [1265] Dr. Reynolds said at that Conference: 'The Catechism in the
   Common Prayer-Book is too brief, and that of Mr. Nowell (late Dean of
   St. Paul's) too long for novices to learn by heart. I request,
   therefore, that one uniform Catechism may be made, and none other
   generally received.' To this King James replied: 'I think the doctor's
   request very reasonable, yet so that the Catechism may be made in the
   fewest and plainest affirmative terms that may be,--not like the many
   ignorant Catechisms in Scotland, set out by every one who was the son
   of a good man.'--Fuller's Church History of Britain, Vol. V. p. 284.

   [1266] Dr. Shields, in his edition of the Book of Common Prayer as
   amended by the Savoy Conference (Phila. 1867), has inserted the Shorter
   Westminster Catechism in the place of the Anglican Catechism. But it
   does not harmonize with the genius of the Prayer-Book.

   [1267] Both editions are reprinted by the Parker Society in Liturgies,
   etc., of Edward VI.

   [1268] 'Catechismus brevis Christianæ disciplinæ summam continens:' 'A
   short Catechism, or plain instruction, containing the sum of Christian
   learning, set forth by the King's Majesty's authority, for all
   schoolmasters to teach.' The authority of this Catechism was afterwards
   disputed. See Hardwick, Hist. of the Articles, p. 109.

   [1269] The larger Catechism appeared first in Latin under the title
   'Catechismus, sive prima institutio disciplinaque pietatis Christianæ,
   latine explicata. Reprinted in Bishop Randolph's Enchirid. Theolog. See
   Churton's Life of Nowell, pp. 183 sq., and Lathbury, History of Convoc.
   pp. 167 sq.

   [1270] Procter says (p. 400): 'Even in 1578, when the exclusive use of
   Nowell's Catechism had been enjoined in the canons of 1571, those of
   Calvin, Bullinger, and others were still ordered by statute to be used
   in the University of Oxford.'

   Strype, Fuller, Collier, and Hardwick, l.c.


   The Lambeth Articles have never had full symbolical authority in the
   Church of England, but they are of historical interest as showing the
   ascendency of the predestinarian system of Calvin in the last decade of
   the sixteenth century. [1271]

   As Calvin became more fully known in England, he acquired an authority
   over the leading divines and the Universities almost as great is that
   of St. Augustine during the reign of Edward VI., or, in the language of
   Hooker, as that of the 'Master of Sentences' in the palmy days of
   scholasticism, 'so that the perfectest divines were judged they which
   were skillfullest in Calvin's writings.' Hardwick, speaking of the
   latter part of the Elizabethan period, admits that 'during an interval
   of nearly thirty years the extreme opinions of the school of Calvin,
   not excluding his theory of irrespective reprobation, were predominant
   in almost every town and parish.' The stern, bold, uncompromising
   predestinarianism of the Geneva Reformer seemed to furnish the best
   antidote to the twin errors of Pelagianism and Popery. The Puritan
   party without an exception, and the great majority of the conforming
   clergy, understood the Articles of Religion as teaching his doctrines
   of free-will, election, and perseverance; but some of them thought them
   not strong enough.

   The University of Cambridge was a stronghold of the Calvinistic system.
   It was taught there by Thomas Cartwright, the Margaret Professor of
   Divinity (who, however, was deposed in 1571 for Puritanic
   sentiments--d. 1603); William Perkins, Fellow and Tutor of Christ's
   College (d. 1602); [1272] and especially by Dr. William Whitaker
   (Whittaker), the Regius Professor of Divinity (d. 1595). [1273]

   But in the same University there arose an opposition which created
   great stir. It began with Baro (Baron), a French refugee, who, by the
   favor of Burghley, was promoted to the Margaret Professorship of
   Divinity (1574). He inferred from the history of the Ninevites that God
   predestinated all men to eternal life, but on condition of their faith
   and perseverance. [1274] For this opinion, which he more fully
   explained in a sermon, he was cited before Dr. Goade, the
   Vice-Chancellor of the University; and although the proceedings were
   stopped by the interposition of Burghley, he retired to London (1596),
   where he died a few years afterwards. The same cause was taken up more
   vigorously by William Barrett, a fellow of Caius College, who, in a
   'concio ad clerum,' preached in Great St. Mary's Church, April 29,
   1595, indulged in a virulent attack on the honored names of Calvin,
   Beza, Peter Martyr, and Zanchius, and their doctrine of irrespective
   predestination.

   The academic controversy was carried by both parties first to the
   Vice-Chancellor and heads of Colleges, and then to Archbishop Whitgift,
   of Canterbury. Whitgift, a High-Churchman and an enemy of Puritanism,
   seemed at first inclined to take part with Barrett, but yielded to the
   pressure of the University. Barrett was obliged to admit his ignorance
   and mistake, and to modify his dogmatic statements. He left England and
   joined the Church of Rome.

   To settle this controversy, and to prevent future trouble, the heads of
   the University sent Dr. Whitaker and Dr. Tyndal (Dean of Ely) to
   London, to confer with the Archbishop and other learned divines. The
   result was the adoption of Nine Articles, at Lambeth, Nov. 20, 1595.
   [1275] They contain a clear and strong enunciation of the
   predestinarian system, by teaching--

   1. The eternal election of some to life, and the reprobation of others
   to death.

   2. The moving cause of predestination to life is not the foreknowledge
   of faith and good works, but only the good pleasure of God.

   3. The number of the elect is unalterably fixed.

   4. Those who are not predestinated to life shall necessarily be damned
   for their sins.

   5. The true faith of the elect never fails finally nor totally.

   6. A true believer, or one furnished with justifying faith, has a full
   assurance and certainty of remission and everlasting salvation in
   Christ.

   7. Saving grace is not communicated to all men.

   8. No man can come to the Son unless the Father shall draw him, but all
   men are not drawn by the Father.

   9. It is not in every one's will and power to be saved.

   The Articles were drawn up by Whitaker (who died soon afterwards), and
   somewhat modified by the Bishops to make them less objectionable to
   anti-Calvinists. Thus the fifth Article originally stated that true
   faith could not totally and finally fail 'in those who had once been
   partakers of it;' while in the revision the words 'in the elect' (i.e.,
   a special class of the regenerated) were substituted. [1276] The
   Articles thus amended were signed by Archbishop Whitgift, Dr. Richard
   Fletcher, [1277] Bishop of London, Dr. Richard Vaughan, Bishop elect of
   Bangor, and others. They were also sent to Dr. Hutton, Archbishop of
   York, and Dr. Young, Bishop of Rochester. Hutton indorsed the first
   Article with 'verissimum,' and approved the rest with the remark that
   they could all be plainly collected or fairly deduced from the
   Scriptures and the writings of St. Augustine.

   Whitgift sent the Lambeth Articles to the University of Cambridge (Nov.
   24), not as new laws and decrees, but as an explanation of certain
   points already established by the laws of the land. But inasmuch as
   they had not the Queen's sanction (though he states that the Queen was
   fully persuaded of the truth of them, which is inconsistent with her
   conduct), they should be used privately and with discretion. [1278]

   Queen Elizabeth, who had no special liking for Calvinism and dogmatic
   controversies, was displeased with the calling of a Synod without her
   authority, which subjected the Lambeth divines to prosecution. [1279]
   She commanded the Archbishop to recall and suppress those Articles
   without delay. At the Hampton Court Conference of King James and
   several prelates with the leaders of the Puritans (Jan., 1604), Dr.
   Reynolds made the request that 'the nine orthodoxal assertions
   concluded on at Lambeth might be inserted into the Book of Articles.'
   [1280] It is stated that they were exhibited at the Synod of Dort by
   the English deputies, as the judgment of their Church on the Arminian
   controversy. But the anti-Calvinistic reaction under the Stuarts
   gradually deprived them of their force in England, while in Ireland
   they obtained for some time a semi-symbolical authority.

   It is interesting to compare with the Lambeth Articles a brief
   predestinarian document of Calvin, recently discovered by the Strasburg
   editors of his works, [1281] and a fragment of Hooker on free-will,
   predestination, and perseverance. The former is stronger, the latter is
   milder, and presents the following slight modification of those
   Articles: [1282]

   'It followeth therefore [says Hooker, at the close of his fragment]--

   '1. That God hath predestinated certain men, not all men.

   '2. That the cause moving him hereunto was not the foresight or any
   virtue in us at all.

   '3. That to him the number of his elect is definitely known.

   '4. That it can not be but their sins must condemn them to whom the
   purpose of his saving mercy doth not extend.

   '5. That to God's foreknown elect final continuance of grace is given.

   [Art. 6 of the Lambeth series is omitted by Hooker.]

   '6. [7.] That inward grace whereby to be saved is deservedly not given
   unto all men.

   '7. [8.] That no man cometh unto Christ whom God by the inward grace of
   his Spirit draweth not.

   '8. [9.] And that it is not in every, no, not in any man's own mere
   ability, freedom, and power, to be saved, no man's salvation being
   possible without grace. Howbeit, God is no favorer of sloth; and
   therefore there can be no such absolute decree touching man's salvation
   as on our part includeth no necessity of care and travail, but shall
   certainly take effect, whether we ourselves do wake or sleep.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1271] Fuller says (Vol. V. p. 227): 'All that I will say of the credit
   of these Articles is this: that as medals of gold and silver, though
   they will not pass in payment for current coin, because not stamped
   with the King's inscription, yet they will go with goldsmiths for as
   much as they are in weight; so, though these Articles want authentic
   reputation to pass for provincial acts, as lacking sufficient
   authority, yet will they be readily received of orthodox Christians for
   as far as their own purity bears conformity to God's Word. . . . Their
   testimony is an infallible evidence what was the general and received
   doctrine of England in that age about the forenamed controversies.'

   [1272] He wrote the Golden Chain, or Armilla aurea (1592), which
   contains a very clear, logical exposition of the predestinarian order
   of the causes of salvation and damnation. His works were published in 3
   vols. London, 1616-18.

   [1273] He wrote the best defense of the Protestant doctrine of the
   Scriptures against Bellarmine and Stapleton. His works were published
   in Latin at Geneva (1610), 2 vols., and in part republished by the
   Parker Society, Cambridge, 1849.

   [1274] Prælect. in Ionam Prophetam, London, 1579, and Concio ad Clerum,
   preached in 1595. See the Letter of the heads of Cambridge, March 8,
   1595, to Secretary Lord Burghley (Cecil), Chancellor of the University,
   in Collier, Vol. VII. p. 193.

   [1275] This is the correct date, given by Strype from the authentic MS.
   copy which is headed, 'Articuli approbati a reverendissimis dominis D.
   D. Ioanne archiepiscopo Cantuariensi, et Richardo episcopo Londinensi,
   et aliis Theologis, Lambethæ, Novembris 20, anno 1595.' Heylin and
   Collier give the 10th of November.

   [1276] See the original draft and the comments thereon, in Hardwick, p.
   345, where we find the remark: 'In autographo Whitakeri verba erant,
   "in iis qui semel ejus participes fuerunt;" pro quibus a Lambethanis
   substituta sunt "in electis," sensu plane alio, et ad mentem Augustini;
   cum in autographo sint ad mentem Calvini. Augustinus enim opinatus est,
   "veram fidem quæ per dilectionem operatur, per quam contingit adoptio,
   justificatio et sanctificatio, posse et intercidi et amitti: fidem vero
   esse commune donum electis et reprobis, sed perseverantiam electis
   propriam:" Calvinus autem, "veram et justificantem fidem solis
   salvandis et electis contingere."'

   [1277] Not Richard Bancroft, as Fuller states; for Bancroft was not
   made Bishop of London till 1597.

   [1278] Heylin endeavors to relieve Whitgift from the odium of signing
   the Lambeth Articles by casting doubt on his honesty. Whitgift sided
   with Hooker against Travers, and entertained Dr. Harsnet in his family,
   who derided the doctrine of unconditional reprobation in a sermon at
   St. Paul's Cross (1584). See Collier, pp. 186, 189. But while he may
   have been opposed to strict Calvinism, as he certainly was to
   Puritanism, he seems to have been in full accord with the Augustinian
   infralapsarianism.

   [1279] Fuller (Vol. V. p. 222) relates that the Queen, in her laconic
   style, reminded the Primate, half in jest, that by his unauthorized
   call of a council he had 'incurred the guilt of præmunire.'

   [1280] See Fuller, who gives a minute account of this famous
   Conference, Vol. V. p. 275.

   The Protestant clergy in Ireland accepted the English Prayer-Book in
   1560. Whether the Elizabethan Articles of Religion were also adopted is
   uncertain. [1283] At all events, they did not fully satisfy the
   rigorous Calvinism which came to prevail there for a period even more
   extensively than in England, and which found an advocate in an Irish
   scholar and prelate of commanding character and learning.

   The first Convocation of the Irish Protestant clergy, which took place
   after the model of the English Convocation, adopted a doctrinal formula
   of its own, under the title 'Articles of Religion, agreed upon by the
   Archbishops and Bishops, and the rest of the clergy of Ireland, in the
   Convocation holden at Dublin in the year of our Lord God 1615, for the
   avoiding of diversities of opinions, and the establishing of consent
   touching true religion.'

   They were drawn up by James Ussher, [1284] head of the theological
   faculty and Vice-Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, afterwards
   Archbishop of Armagh, and Primate of all Ireland. He was born in 1580,
   died 1656, and was buried in Westminster Abbey by order of Cromwell. He
   was the greatest theological and antiquarian scholar of the Episcopal
   Church of his age, and was highly esteemed by Churchmen and Puritans,
   being a connecting link between the contending parties. He was elected
   into the Westminster Assembly of Divines, but the King's prohibition
   and his loyalty to the cause of the crown and episcopacy forbade him to
   attend. He had an extraordinary familiarity with Biblical and patristic
   literature, and, together with his friend Vossius of Holland, he laid
   the foundation for a critical investigation of the oecumenical creeds.
   Whether formally commissioned by the Convocation or not, he must, from
   his position, have had the principal share in the preparation of those
   Articles. They are 'in strict conformity with the opinions he
   entertained at that period of his life.' [1285]

   By a decree of the Synod appended to the Dublin Articles, they were to
   be a rule of public doctrine, and any minister who should publicly
   teach any doctrine contrary to them, and after due admonition should
   refuse to conform, was to be 'silenced and deprived of all spiritual
   promotions.' The Viceroy of Ireland, in the name of King James, gave
   his approval. James, with all his high notions of episcopacy and hatred
   of Puritanism, was a Calvinist in theology, and countenanced the Synod
   of Dort. It is stated that the adoption of this Confession induced
   Calvinistic ministers of Scotland to settle in Ireland. [1286]

   But in the reign of Charles I. and his adviser, Archbishop Laud, a
   reaction set in against Calvinism. An Irish Convocation in 1635, under
   the lead of the Earl of Strafford, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and his
   chaplain, John Bramhall (one of the ablest High-Church Episcopalians,
   who was made Bishop of Londonderry, 1634, and Archbishop of Armagh,
   1661--died, 1663), adopted the Thirty-nine Articles 'for the
   manifestation of agreement with the Church of England in the confession
   of the same Christian faith and the doctrine of the sacraments.' This
   act was intended quietly to set aside the Irish Articles; and hence
   they were ignored in the canons adopted by that convocation. [1287]
   Ussher, however, who continued to adhere to Calvinism, though on terms
   of friendship with Laud, required subscription to both series, and in a
   contemporary letter to Dr. Ward he says: 'The Articles of Religion
   agreed upon in our former Synod, anno 1615, we let stand as we did
   before. But for the manifestation of our agreement with the Church of
   England, we have received and approved your Articles also, concluded in
   the year 1562, as you may see in the first of our Canons.' [1288] After
   the Restoration the Dublin Articles seem to have been lost sight of,
   and no mention was made of them when, in the beginning of the
   nineteenth century, the English and Irish establishments were
   consolidated into 'the United Church of England and Ireland.' [1289]

   The Irish Articles are one hundred and four in number, arranged under
   nineteen heads. They are a clear and succinct system of divinity, in
   full harmony with Calvinism, excepting the doctrine of the
   ecclesiastical supremacy of the crown (which is retained from the
   English Articles). They incorporate the substance of the Thirty-nine
   Articles and the Lambeth Articles, but are more systematic and
   complete. They teach absolute predestination and perseverance, denounce
   the Pope as Antichrist, inculcate the Puritan view of Sabbath
   observance, and make no mention of three orders in the ministry, nor of
   the necessity of episcopal ordination. In all these particulars they
   prepared the way for the doctrinal standards of the Westminster
   Assembly. They were the chief basis of the Westminster Confession, as
   is evident from the general order, the headings of chapters and
   subdivisions, and the almost literal agreement of language in the
   statement of several of the most important doctrines. [1290]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1283] Archbishop Ussher, in a sermon preached before the English House
   of Commons, 1621, declared: 'We all agree that the Scriptures of God
   are the perfect rule of our faith: we all consent in the main grounds
   of religion drawn from thence; we all subscribe to the Articles of
   Doctrine agreed upon in the Synod of the year 1562.' But he must have
   understood this in the general sense of assent, as he was addressing
   laymen who never subscribed the Articles. Elrington, p. 43, and
   Hardwick, p. 182. The Irish Church adopted, in 1566 (1567), a 'Brief
   Declaration' in XII. Articles of Religion; but these are substantially
   the same as the XI. Articles prepared by Archbishop Parker, 1559 or
   1560, and provisionally used in England till 1563. In Ireland they
   continued in force till 1615. See Elrington, Append.; Hardwick, pp.
   122, 337; and Killen, Vol. I. pp. 395, 515-520.

   Before closing this section we must notice a recent American
   reconstruction of the English Articles of Religion, which goes much
   farther than the revision of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and is
   disowned by it, but must still be considered as an offshoot from the
   same root. We mean the 'Articles of Religion' set forth in 1875 by the
   Reformed Episcopal Church.

   ORIGIN.

   This body seceded from the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United
   States under the lead of the Rev. Dr. George David Cummins, Assistant
   Bishop of the Diocese of Kentucky (d. 1876). The reason of his sudden
   and unexpected resignation was his dissatisfaction with High-Church
   ritualism and exclusiveness, and his despair of checking their progress
   within the regular Episcopal Church. The occasion was the manifestation
   of this exclusiveness in a public protest of the Bishop of the diocese
   of New York against the General Conference of the Evangelical Alliance
   in Oct., 1873, and against the interdenominational communion services,
   in which Bishop Cummins, together with the Dean of Canterbury (with the
   full approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury), had taken a prominent
   part [1291] He compared his conduct with the Old Catholic reaction
   against modern Romanism. [1292] He desired simply to organize the
   theology and polity of the Low-Church party on the historic basis of
   the American Episcopal Church itself in its initial stage, as
   represented by Bishop White and the first bishops of Virginia and New
   York. Hence his return to the 'Proposed Book' of 1785, and to the
   labors of the Royal Commission in 1689.

   The resignation of Bishop Cummins was followed by his canonical
   deposition. The majority of his brethren preferred to fight the battle
   within the old Church, or quietly to wait for a favorable reaction, and
   strongly disapproved of his course. [1293] Others deprecated from
   principle the multiplication of denominations, and feared that the new
   sect might become narrower than the old. Still others, though unwilling
   to share the risk and responsibility, wished it well, in the hope that
   it might administer a wholesome rebuke to the hierarchical spirit. A
   small number of Low-Church clergymen and laymen followed his example. A
   new ecclesiastical organization, under the name of the Reformed
   Episcopal Church, was effected at a council held in the Young Men's
   Christian Association building, at New York, Dec. 2, 1873. [1294] It
   set forth the following

   DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES:

   I. The Reformed Episcopal Church, holding 'the faith once delivered
   unto the saints,' declares its belief in the Holy Scriptures of the Old
   and New Testaments as the Word of God, and the sole Rule of Faith and
   Practice; in the Creed 'commonly called the Apostles' Creed;' in the
   divine institution of the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper;
   and in the doctrines of grace substantially as they are set forth in
   the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion.

   II. This Church recognizes and adheres to Episcopacy, not as of divine
   right, but as a very ancient and desirable form of church polity.

   III. This Church, retaining a Liturgy which shall not be imperative or
   repressive of freedom in prayer, accepts the Book of Common Prayer, as
   it was revised, proposed, and recommended for use by the General
   Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church, A.D. 1785, reserving
   full liberty to alter, abridge, enlarge, and amend the same, as may
   seem most conducive to the edification of the people, 'provided that
   the substance of the faith be kept entire.'

   IV. This Church condemns and rejects the following erroneous and
   strange doctrines as contrary to God's Word:

   First, That the Church of Christ exists only in one order or form of
   ecclesiastical polity.

   Second, That Christian ministers are 'priests' in another sense than
   that in which all believers are 'a royal priesthood.'

   Third, That the Lord's Table is an altar on which the oblation of the
   Body and Blood of Christ is offered anew to the Father.

   Fourth, That the Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper is a presence
   in the elements of Bread and Wine.

   Fifth, That Regeneration is inseparably connected with Baptism.

   The next work was the revision of the Liturgy on the basis of the
   'Proposed Book' of 1785, by the Second Council, held at New York, 1874.
   The Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed were retained, but the clause
   'He descended into hell' was stricken out from the former. In the
   baptismal service, thanksgiving for the regeneration of the child was
   omitted. Throughout the book the words 'minister' and 'Lord's table'
   were substituted for 'priest' and 'altar'--a change which had been
   proposed long before by the English commission of 1689.

   THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION.

   A considerable number of the Western members of this new denomination
   were in favor of adopting simply the Apostles' Creed and the Nine
   Articles of the Evangelical Alliance. But the majority insisted on
   retaining the Thirty-nine Articles with a few changes. The revision was
   intrusted to a Committee of Doctrine and Worship, consisting of Rev. W.
   R. Nicholson, D.D. (since consecrated Bishop, March, 1876), Rev. B. B.
   Leacock, D.D., Rev. Joseph D. Wilson, and some laymen. The report of
   the committee was amended and adopted at the Third General Council,
   held in Chicago, May 12-18, 1875.

   The Articles of Religion are thirty-five in number. They follow the
   order of the Thirty-nine Articles, and adhere to them in language and
   sentiment much more closely than the Twenty Articles of the 'Proposed
   Book' of 1785 and the Seventeen Articles of the Episcopal Convention of
   1799. Articles 1 and 2, of the Trinity and Incarnation, are retained
   with slight verbal alterations. Art. 3, of the descent of Christ into
   Hades, is omitted. Art. 3, of the Resurrection 'and the Second Coming'
   of Christ, Art. 4, of the Holy Ghost, and Art. 5, of the Holy
   Scriptures, are enlarged. Art. 8, of the old series, concerning the
   three creeds, is omitted; but in Art. 22 the Nicene Creed and the
   Apostles' Creed are acknowledged. The Articles of free-will,
   justification, and good works are retained, with some enlargements on
   justification by faith alone (which Bishop Cummins regards with Luther
   as the article of a standing or falling Church). Art. 18 is an
   abridgment of Art. 17, but affirms, together with predestination and
   election, also the doctrine of human freedom and responsibility,
   without attempting a reconciliation. The Articles of the Church and
   Church Authority are enlarged, but not altered in sense. Art. 24 wholly
   rejects the doctrine of 'Apostolic Succession' as 'unscriptural and
   productive of great mischief;' adding, 'This Church values its historic
   ministry, but recognizes and honors as equally valid the ministry of
   other Churches, even as God the Holy Ghost has accompanied their work
   with demonstration and power.' Baptism is declared to be only 'a sign
   of regeneration ' (not an instrument). Art. 27 rejects
   consubstantiation as well as transubstantiation, as 'equally productive
   of idolatrous errors and practices,' but otherwise agrees with Art. 28
   of the old series. Arts. 31 and 32 reject purgatory, the worship of
   saints and images, confession for absolution, and other Romish
   practices. Art. 34, of the power of tie civil authority, is the same as
   Art. 37 of the Protestant Episcopal Church (retained from the draft of
   1799), except that the words 'as well clergy as laity' are exchanged
   for 'as well ministers as people.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1291] In his letter of resignation to Bishop B. B. Smith, of Kentucky,
   dated Nov. 10, 1873, Cummins alludes to those solemn services, and
   adds: 'As I can not surrender the right and privilege thus to meet my
   fellow-Christians of other Churches around the table of our dear Lord,
   I must take my place where I can do so without alienating those of my
   own household of faith. I therefore leave the communion in which I have
   labored in the sacred ministry for over twenty-eight years, and
   transfer my work and office to another sphere of labor.'

   [1292] There is, however, this material difference, that the Episcopal
   Church as a body has not altered her creed, nor added new dogmas, as
   the Roman Church has done in the Vatican Council.

   [1293] Though a gentleman of unblemished moral character, he was
   publicly charged by one of his evangelical fellow-bishops with the
   threefold crime of breaking his ordination vows, creating a schism, and
   consecrating, single-handed, a deposed clergyman (Dr. Cheney, of
   Chicago) to the episcopate. The last act was considered the crowning
   offense; for thereby he destroyed the monopoly of the apostolic
   succession, which, in the estimation of many modern Episcopalians, is
   the article of a standing or falling Church.

   [1294] It has since grown steadily, though by no means rapidly. It
   numbers now (1884) ten bishops, ninety-eight presbyters, and about as
   many congregations in the United States, Canada, British Columbia,
   Bermuda Islands, and England. The number of communicants is about 7000.

   The Reformation in Scotland was far more consistent and radical than in
   England, and resulted in the establishment of Calvinistic
   Presbyterianism under the sole headship of Christ. While in England
   politics controlled religion, in Scotland religion controlled politics.
   The leading figure was a plain presbyter, a man as bold, fearless, and
   uncompromising as Cranmer was timid, cautious, and conservative. In
   England the crown and the bishops favored the Reformation, in Scotland
   they opposed it; but Scotch royalty was a mere shadow compared with the
   English, and was, during that crisis, represented by a woman as
   blundering and unfortunate as Elizabeth was sagacious and successful.
   George Buchanan, the Erasmus of Scotland, the classical tutor of Mary
   and her son James, maintained, as the Scotch doctrine, that governments
   existed for the sake of the governed, which in England was regarded at
   that time as the sum of all heresy and rebellion. [1295] When James
   became king of England, he blessed God's gracious goodness for bringing
   him 'into the promised land, where religion is purely professed, where
   he could sit amongst grave, learned, and reverend men; not as before,
   elsewhere, a king without state, without honor, without order, where
   beardless boys would brave him to the face.' [1296]

   The Scotch Reformation was carried on, agreeably to the character of
   the people of that age and country, with strong passion and violence,
   and in close connection with a political revolution; but it elevated
   Scotland at last to a very high degree of religious, moral, and
   intellectual eminence, which contrasts most favorably with its own
   mediæval condition, as well as with the present aspect of Southern
   Roman Catholic countries, once far superior to it in point of
   civilization and religion. [1297]

   In the middle of the sixteenth century the Scotch were still a
   semi-barbarous though brave and energetic race. Their character and
   previous history are as wild and romantic as their lochs, mountains,
   and rapids, and show an exuberance of animal life, full of blazing
   passions and violent commotions, but without ideas and progress. The
   kings of the house of Stuart were in constant conflict with a restless
   and rebellious nobility and the true interests of the common people.
   The history of that ill-fated dynasty, from its fabulous patriarch
   Banquo, in the eleventh century, down to the execution of Queen Mary
   (1587), and the final expulsion of her descendants from England (1688),
   is a series of tragedies foreshadowed in Shakspere's 'Macbeth,' where
   crimes and retributions come whirling along like the rushing of a
   furious tempest. The powerful and fierce nobility were given to the
   chase and the practice of arms, to rapine and murder. Their dress was
   that of the camp or stable; they lived in narrow towers, built for
   defense, without regard to comfort or beauty. They regarded each other
   as rivals, the king as but the highest of their own order, and the
   people as mere serfs, who lived scattered under the shadow of castles
   and convents. The patriarchal or clan system which prevailed in the
   Highlands, and the feudal system which the Norman barons superinduced
   in the south, kept the nation divided into a number of jealous and
   conflicting sections, and made the land a scene of chronic strife and
   anarchy.

   In this unsettled state of society morals and religion could not
   flourish. The Church kept alive the faith in the verities of the
   supernatural world, restrained passion and crime, distributed the
   consolations of religion from the cradle to the grave, and built such
   monuments as the Cathedral of Glasgow and the Abbey of Melrose; but it
   left the people in ignorance and superstition. It owned the full half
   of all the wealth of the nation from times when land was poor and
   cheap, and it had the controlling influence in the privy council, the
   parliament, and over the people. But this very wealth and political
   power became a source of corruption, which rose to a fearful height
   before the Reformation. The law of celibacy was practically annulled,
   and the clergy were shamefully dissolute and disgracefully ignorant.
   Some priests are said to have regarded Luther as the author of the New
   Testament. The bishops and abbots, by frequently assisting the king
   against the nobles, and rivaling with them in secular pomp and
   influence, excited their envy and hatred, which hastened their ruin.

   Owing to its remoteness, poverty, and inhospitable climate, Scotland
   was more free than England from the interference of the pope and his
   Italian creatures. But this independence was rather a disadvantage, for
   without preventing the progress of the native corruptions, it kept off
   the civilizing influences of the Continent, and removed the check upon
   the despotism of the king. James III. usurped the right of filling the
   episcopal vacancies without the previous election of the chapters and
   the papal sanction, and consulted his temporal interest more than that
   of religion. Simony of the most shameful kind became the order of the
   day. James V. (1528-42) provided for his illegitimate children by
   making them abbots and priors of Holyrood House, Kelso, Melrose,
   Coldingham, and St. Andrew's. Most of the higher dignities of the
   Church were in the hands of the royal favorites and younger sons of the
   nobility, who were sometimes not ordained, nor even of age, but who
   drew, nevertheless, the income of the cathedrals and abbeys, and
   disgraced the holy office. 'By this fraudulent and sacrilegious
   dealing'--says an impartial old authority--'the rents and benefices of
   the Church became the patrimony of private families, and persons in no
   ecclesiastical orders, and even boys too, were, by the presentation of
   our kings and the provision of the popes, set over the episcopal sees
   themselves. The natural result of this was that by far too many of
   these prelates, being neither bred up in letters, nor having in them
   any virtuous dispositions, did not only live irregularly themselves,
   but through neglect of their charge did likewise introduce by degrees
   such a deluge of ignorance and vice among the clergy and all ranks of
   men that the state of the Church seemed to call loudly for a
   reformation of both.'

   The first impulse to the Reformation in Scotland came from Lutheran
   writings and from copies of Tyndale's New Testament. The first
   preachers and martyrs of Protestantism were Patrick Hamilton, who had
   studied in Wittenberg and Marburg, and was burned (1528), George
   Wishart, who shared the same fate (1546), and the aged Walter Mill, who
   predicted from the flames (Aug. 28, 1558), 'A hundred better men shall
   rise out of the ashes of my bones, and I shall be the last to suffer
   death in Scotland for this cause.'

   In the mean time God had prepared the right man for this crisis.

   § 88. John Knox.

   Literature.

   Besides the works of Knox, the excellent biography of M'Crie, and
   Lorimer's monograph quoted in the preceding section, comp. Froude's
   Lecture on The Influence of the Reformation on the Scottish Character,
   1865 (in Short Studies on Great Subjects, Vol. I. pp. 128 sqq.), and an
   exceedingly characteristic essay of Thomas Carlyle on the Portraits of
   John Knox, which first appeared in Fraser's Magazine for April, 1875,
   and then as an appendix to his Early Kings of Norway. London, 1875 (pp.
   209-307), and New York (Harper's ed. pp. 173-257). Brandes follows
   M'Crie very closely. Laing, in the first vol. of his edition of Knox's
   History of the Reformation (pp. xiii.-xliv.), gives a convenient
   chronological summary of the chief events of his life.


   John Knox (1505-1572), the Luther of Scotland, was educated in the
   University of Glasgow, and ordained to the Romish priesthood (1530),
   but became a convert to Protestantism (1545, the year of Wishart's
   martyrdom [1298] through the study of the Bible and the writings of
   Augustine and Jerome. He went at once to the extreme of opposition, as
   is often the case with strong and determined characters of the Pauline
   type. He abhorred the mass as an 'abominable idolatry and profanation
   of the Lord's Supper,' and popery as the great anti-Christian apostasy
   and Babylonish harlot predicted in the Bible. [1299]

   After preaching awhile to the Protestant soldiers in the garrison of
   St. Andrew's, he was taken prisoner by the French fleet (1547), and
   made a galley-slave for nineteen months, 'going in irons, miserably
   entreated and sore troubled by corporal infirmity.' Regardless of
   danger, he remained true to his faith. When called upon to kiss an
   image of the Holy Virgin, he declared that it was 'no mother of God,
   but a painted piece of wood, fit for swimming rather than being
   worshiped;' and he flung the picture into the river Loire.

   On obtaining his liberty, he labored five years (1549-1554) in England
   as a pioneer of English Puritanism. He preached in Berwick, on the
   borders of Scotland, in Newcastle, and in London. He was elected one of
   the six chaplains of Edward VI. (1551), was consulted about the
   Articles of Religion and the revision of the Liturgy, and was offered
   the bishopric of Rochester, which he declined from opposition to the
   large extent of dioceses, the secular business, vestments, and 'other
   popish fooleries remaining.' [1300]

   After the accession of Bloody Mary he fled among the last, at the
   urgent request of friends, to the Continent, and spent five years (from
   January, 1554, to January, 1559, interrupted by a journey to Scotland,
   November, 1555, to July, 1556), at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and
   especially at Geneva. Here he found 'the most perfect school of Christ
   that ever was since the days of the Apostles.' Though four years older,
   he sat an admiring pupil at the feet of John Calvin, and became more
   Calvinistic than the great Reformer. He preached to a flock of English
   exiles, took part in the Geneva version of the Bible, and aided by his
   pen the cause of evangelical religion in England and Scotland.

   The accession of Queen Elizabeth opened the way for his final return
   and crowning work, although she refused him passage through her
   dominion, and never forgave him his 'blast' at the dignity and ruling
   capacity of her sex. [1301]

   The remaining twelve years of his life were devoted to the fierce
   struggle and triumph of the Reformation in his native land, which he
   has himself so vividly, truthfully, and unselfishly described in his
   History. [1302] Shortly before his death he heard the news of the
   terrible massacre of the Huguenots on St. Bartholomew's night, and
   summoning up the remainder of his broken strength, he thundered from
   the pulpit in Edinburgh his indignation and the vengeance of God
   against 'that cruel murderer and false traitor, the King of France'
   (Charles IX.). His last sermons were on our Lord's crucifixion, a theme
   on which he wished to close his ministry. He presided at the
   installation of Lawson as his colleague and successor, and made an
   impressive address and prayer. As he left the church a crowd of people
   lined the street and followed him to his house to take farewell of
   their pastor. He found his last comfort in the sacerdotal prayer, the
   fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and some psalms, 'hearing' what was
   read, and 'understanding far better.' He died, weary of life and
   longing for heaven, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, in peace,
   without a struggle, lamented by the clergy, the nobles, and the people
   (Nov. 24, 1572). He could conscientiously say on his death-bed, before
   God and his holy angels, that he never made merchandise of religion,
   never studied to please men, never indulged his private passions, but
   faithfully used his talents for the edification of the Church over
   which he was called to watch. He was buried in the graveyard of St.
   Giles's; no monument was erected; a plain stone with his name marks the
   spot.

   Knox was the greatest of Scotchmen, as Luther the greatest of Germans.
   He was the incarnation of all the noble and rugged energies of his
   nation and age, and devoted them to the single aim of a thorough
   reformation in doctrine, worship, and discipline, on the basis of the
   Word of God. [1303] In genius, learning, wealth of ideas, and extent of
   influence, he was inferior to Luther and Calvin, but in boldness,
   strength, and purity of character, fully their equal. [1304] He was the
   most heroic man of a heroic race. His fear of God made him fearless of
   man. Endowed with a vigorous and original intellect, he was eminently a
   man of action, with the pulpit for his throne and the word for his
   sword. A statesman as well as a theologian, he possessed rare political
   sagacity and intuitive knowledge of men. Next to Calvin, he is the
   chief founder of the Presbyterian polity, which has proved its vitality
   and efficiency for more than three centuries. Like St. Paul and Calvin,
   he was small in person and feeble in body, but irresistible in moral
   force. [1305] 'He put more life into his hearers from the pulpit in an
   hour than six hundred trumpets.' [1306] When old and decrepit, leaning
   on his staff and the arm of his faithful servant, he had to be lifted
   to the pulpit; but before the close he became so animated and vigorous
   that he seemed 'likely to ding the pulpit in blads [to beat it in
   pieces] and flie out of it.' [1307] Well did the Earl of Morton, the
   newly elected regent, characterize him over his open grave in that
   sentence which has since been accepted as the best motto of his life:
   'Here lies he who never feared the face of man.' [1308] And in a
   different spirit, James VI paid the same tribute to his fearless
   character, when with uplifted hands he thanked God that the three
   surviving bairns of Knox were all lasses; 'for if they had been three
   lads,' he said to Mrs. Welch, 'I could never have bruiked [enjoyed] my
   three kingdoms in peace.' [1309]

   Knox had the stern and uncompromising spirit of a Hebrew prophet. He
   confronted Queen Mary as Elijah confronted Jezebel, unmoved by her
   beauty, her smiles, or her tears. He himself relates the four or five
   interviews he had with that graceful, accomplished, fascinating, but
   ill-fated lady, whose charms and misfortunes still excite fresh
   feelings of sympathy in every human heart. It is difficult to imagine a
   more striking contrast: Knox the right man in the right place, Mary the
   wrong woman in the wrong place; he intensely Scotch in character and
   aim, she thoroughly French by education and taste; he in the vigor of
   manhood, she in the bloom of youth and beauty; he terribly in earnest,
   she gay and frivolous; he a believer in God's sovereignty and the
   people's right and duty to disobey and depose treacherous princes, she
   a believer in her own absolute right to rule and the subject's duty of
   passive obedience; he abhorring her religion as idolatry and her policy
   as ruin to Scotland, she fearing him as a rude fanatic, an impertinent
   rebel and sorcerer in league with Beelzebub. [1310] We must not judge
   from his conversations with the Queen that he was a woman-hater: he
   respected right women in their proper sphere, as he was respected by
   them, and his correspondence reveals a vain of tenderness and kindly
   genial humor beneath his severity. [1311] But in this case he
   sacrificed all personal considerations to what he believed to be his
   paramount duty to God and his Church.

   The pulpit proved mightier than the throne. The suicidal blunders of
   the Queen, who had more trouble from her three husbands--two of them
   handsome but heartless and worthless ruffians and murderers--than her
   grand-uncle Henry VIII. had from his six wives, are the best
   vindication of the national policy, if not the personal conduct, of the
   Reformer. Had Mary's popish policy triumphed, there would have been an
   end to Protestantism and liberty in Scotland, and probably in England
   too; while Knox, fighting intolerance with intolerance, laid the solid
   foundation for future liberty. He felt at that turning-point of history
   that, what is comparatively harmless now, 'one mass was more dangerous
   to Scotland than an army of ten thousand enemies.' [1312]

   If Knox lacked the sweet and lovely traits of Christian character, it
   should be remembered that God wisely distributes his gifts. Neither the
   polished culture of Erasmus, nor the gentle spirit of Melanchthon, nor
   the cautious measures of Cranmer could have accomplished the mighty
   change in Scotland. Knox was, beyond a doubt, the providential man for
   his country. Scotland alone could produce a Knox, and Knox alone could
   reform Scotland. If any man ever lived to some purpose, and left the
   indelible impress of his character upon posterity, it was John Knox.
   His is to this day the best known and the most popular name in
   Scotland. Such fearless and faithful heroes are among the best gifts of
   God to the world.

   We need not wonder that Knox, like the other Reformers, was pursued by
   malignant calumny during his life, and even charged with unnatural
   crimes, which would make him ridiculous as well as hideous. But those
   who knew him best esteemed him most. Bannatyne, his faithful clerk,
   calls him, in his journal, 'the light of Scotland, the comfort of the
   Church, the mirror of godliness, the pattern of all true ministers in
   purity of life, soundness of doctrine, and boldness in reproving
   wickedness.' James Melville, who heard his last sermons, speaks of him
   as 'that most notable prophet and apostle' of Scotland. [1313]
   Posterity has judged differently, according to the religious
   stand-point. To some he still appears as a semi-barbarous fanatic, a
   dangerous heretic, or at best as a 'holy savage;' while Froude regards
   him as 'the grandest figure in the entire history of the British
   Reformation,' and Carlyle as 'more than a man of genius--a
   heaven-inspired prophet and heroic leader of men.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1298] This is the date given by Laing, while M'Crie assigns Knox's
   conversion to the year 1542.

   [1299] His first Protestant sermon in the parish church at St. Andrew's
   was on Dan. vii., to prove that the pope was the last beast, the man of
   sin, the Antichrist. Some of the hearers said: 'Others hewed at the
   branches of papistry, but he struck at the root to destroy the whole.'
   Calderwood, Vol. I. p.230; Knox's Works, Vol. I. p. 192.

   [1300] His labors in England, and the reasons for his nolo episcopari,
   are fully described by Dr. Lorimer, in part from unpublished sources.

   [1301] Before his return, while the fires of Smithfield were still
   burning, he had published anonymously his 'First Blast of the Trumpet
   against the Monstrous Regiment [i.e., regimen or government] of Women,'
   1558, which was aimed at the misgovernment of Mary Tudor and Mary of
   Guise. This singular and characteristic but unfortunate book begins
   with the sentence, 'To promote a woman to bear rule, superiority,
   dominion, or empire, above any realm, nation, or city, is repugnant to
   nature, contumely to God, a thing most contrarious to his revealed will
   and approved ordinance, and, finally, it is a subversion of all equity
   and justice.' He appealed to the creation, to the Jews, to St. Paul, to
   ancient philosophers and legislators, to the fathers, to the Salic and
   French law. His error was that from some bad examples he drew sweeping
   conclusions, which were soon confirmed by Mary Stuart, but disproved by
   Elizabeth (as they are in our day by the reign of Victoria). No wonder
   that Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were incensed at what they regarded
   a personal insult. Knox himself foresaw the bad consequences, and
   expected to be called 'a sower of sedition, and one day perchance to be
   attainted for treason,' but he was too manly to retract, and retained
   his opinion to the last, but, not wishing to obstruct the path of
   Elizabeth, he never published the intended Second and Third Blast. See
   M'Crie's J. Knox, pp. 141-147 (Philadelphia ed.), and Carlyle, l.c. pp.
   230 sqq.

   [1302] Knox wrote four Books of his History of the Reformation, down to
   1564, at the request of his friends. The Fifth Book is not found in any
   MS. copy, and was first published by David Buchanan in 1644; it relates
   the affairs of the most controverted period in Scottish history, from
   Sept., 1564, to Aug., 1567, when Queen Mary abdicated. Laing thinks
   that it is mostly derived from Knox's papers by some unknown hand
   (Works, Vol. II. p. 468). Carlyle regrets that this 'hasty and
   strangely interesting, impressive, and peculiar History has not been
   rendered far more extensively legible to serious mankind at large.'
   Laing has added a vocabulary.

   [1303] Thomas Carlyle, himself a typical Scotchman, calls Knox 'the
   most Scottish of Scots, and to this day typical of all the qualities
   which belong nationally to the very choicest Scotsmen we have known, or
   had clear record of: utmost sharpness of discernment and
   discrimination, courage enough, and, what is still better, no
   particular consciousness of courage, but a readiness in all simplicity
   to do and dare whatsoever is commanded by the inward voice of native
   manhood; on the whole, a beautiful and simple but complete
   incompatibility with whatsoever is false in word or conduct; inexorable
   contempt and detestation of what in modern speech is called humbug, . .
   . a most clear-cut, hardy, distinct, and effective man; fearing God,
   and without any other fear.' He severely characterizes the patriarchal,
   long-bearded, but stolid picture of Knox in Beza's Icones (Geneva,
   1580), and in Laing's edition, and represents the 'Somerville
   portrait,' with a sharp, stern face, high forehead, pointed beard, and
   large white collar, as the only probable likeness of the great
   Reformer.

   [1304] M'Crie (p. 355) well compares him with the three leading
   Reformers: 'Knox bore a striking resemblance to Luther in personal
   intrepidity and in popular eloquence. He approached nearest to Calvin
   in his religious sentiments, in the severity of his manners, and in a
   certain impressive air of melancholy which pervaded his character. And
   he resembled Zwinglius in his ardent attachment to the principles of
   civil liberty, and in combining his exertions for the reformation of
   the Church with uniform endeavors to improve the political state of the
   people. Not that I would place our Reformer on a level with this
   illustrious triumvirate. There is a splendor which surrounds the great
   German Reformer, partly arising from the intrinsic heroism of his
   character, and partly reflected from the interesting situation in which
   his long and doubtful struggle with the Court of Rome placed him in the
   eyes of Europe, which removes him at a distance from all who started in
   the same glorious career. The Genevese Reformer surpassed Knox in the
   extent of his theological learning, and in the unrivaled solidity and
   clearness of his judgment. And the Reformer of Switzerland, though
   inferior to him in masculine elocution and in daring courage, excelled
   him in self-command, in prudence, and in that species of eloquence
   which steals into the heart, convinces without irritating, and governs
   without assuming the tone of authority. But although "he attained not
   to the first three," I know not, among all the eminent men who appeared
   at that period, any name which is so well entitled to be placed next to
   theirs as that of Knox, whether we consider the talents with which he
   was endowed, or the important services which he performed.'

   [1305] 'Haud scio an unquam majus ingenium in fragili et imbecillo
   corpusculo collocarit.' Principal Smeton, as quoted by M'Crie, p. 355.

   [1306] So the English embassador, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, wrote to
   Cecil.

   [1307] Thus his eloquence was described, in 1571, by James Melville,
   then a student and constant hearer of Knox. A lively Frenchman, in the
   Journal des Debats, gave the following amusing version of this account:
   'A Presbyterian fanatic named Knox, . . . old and broken down, . . .
   began his sermon in a feeble voice and slow action; but soon heating
   himself by the force of his passion and hatred, he bestirred himself
   like a madman; he broke his pulpit, and jumped into the midst of his
   hearers (sautoit au milien des auditeurs).' M'Crie, p. 325.

   [1308] Or, in the less graceful but more expressive original phrase, as
   given by James Melville (the only authority for it), 'He neither feared
   nor flattered any flesh.'

   [1309] Mrs. Welch was a daughter of Knox, and gained admission to the
   King, in London, 1622, to ask his permission for the return of her sick
   husband (a worthy Presbyterian minister, who had been exiled for his
   resistance to the re-establishment of episcopacy) to his native
   Scotland. James at last yielded on condition that she should persuade
   him to submit to the bishops; but the lady, lifting up her apron and
   holding it towards the King, replied, in the genuine spirit of her
   father, 'Please your Majesty, I'd rather kep [receive] his head there.'
   Mr. Welch died in London soon after this singular conversation; his
   widow returned to Ayr, and survived him three years, 'a spouse and
   daughter worthy of such a husband and such a father.' M'Crie, p. 362.
   Knox was twice married and had two sons by his first wife, Marjory
   Bowes, of London, and three daughters by his second wife, Margaret
   Stewart, of a high noble family in Scotland. The sons were educated at
   Cambridge, but died young, without issue.

   [1310] Carlyle thus speaks of this remarkable chapter in the Scotch
   Reformation: 'The interviews of Knox with the Queen are what one would
   most like to produce to readers; but unfortunately they are of a tone
   which, explain as we might, not one reader in a thousand could be made
   to sympathize with or do justice to in behalf of Knox. The treatment
   which that young, beautiful, and high chief personage in Scotland
   receives from the rigorous Knox, would to most modern men seem
   irreverent, cruel, almost barbarous. Here more than elsewhere Knox
   proves himself,--here more than any where bound to do it,--the Hebrew
   Prophet in complete perfection; refuses to soften any expression or to
   call any thing by its milder name, or in short for one moment to forget
   that the Eternal God and His Word are great, and that all else is
   little, or is nothing; nay, if it set itself against the Most High and
   His Word, is the one frightful thing that this world exhibits. He is
   never in the least ill-tempered with her Majesty; but she can not move
   him from that fixed centre of all his thoughts and actions: Do the will
   of God, and tremble at nothing; do against the will of God, and know
   that, in the Immensity and the Eternity around you, there is nothing
   but matter of terror. Nothing can move Knox here or elsewhere from that
   standing-ground; no consideration of Queen's sceptres and armies and
   authorities of men is of any efficacy or dignity whatever in
   comparison; and becomes not beautiful, but horrible, when it sets
   itself against the Most High.'

   [1311] See his letters of comfort to Mrs. Bowes, his mother-in-law, who
   suffered much from religious melancholy, in Works by Laing, Vol. III.
   pp. 337-343, and Vol. VI. p. 513; also in Lorimer, pp. 39 sqq.

   [1312] Froude says: 'Toleration is a good thing in its place; but you
   can not tolerate what will not tolerate you, and is trying to cut your
   throat. . . . The Covenanters fought the fight and won the victory, and
   then, and not till then, came the David Humes with their essays on
   miracles, and the Adam Smiths with their political economies, and
   steam-engines, and railroads, and philosophical institutions, and all
   the other blessed or unblessed fruits of liberty' 1.c. pp. 148, 149).

   [1313] Beza also calls him 'Scotorum apostolum.'

   § 89. The Scotch Confession of Faith. A.D. 1560.

   Literature.

   The Scotch Confession in the original Scotch dialect, together with the
   authorized Latin version of Patrick Adamson (1572), is printed in Vol.
   III. pp. 427-470, from Dunlop's Collection, Vol. II. pp. 13 sqq. It
   appeared at Edinburgh, 1561 (Robert Lekprevik), without the marginal
   Scripture references, in the Minutes of Parliament, in Knox's History
   of the Reformation (Vol. II. pp. 93 sqq.; Laing's ed.), in Calderwood's
   History of the Kirk of Scotland (Vol. II. pp. 16 sqq.; Thomson's ed.
   for the Wodrow Soc.), in Edward Irving's reprint of the Conf. and the
   Book of Discipline (1831), and (abridged) in Innes, Law of Creeds (pp.
   38 sqq.). In the Writings of John Knox, by the Presbyterian Board of
   Publication, Phila., 1842, pp. 237 sqq., it is given in modern English.

   A Latin version (less correct and elegant than that of Adamson)
   appeared in the Corpus et Syntagma Conf., 1612 and 1654, and is
   reproduced in Niemeyer's Collectio, pp. 340 sqq. Niemeyer's critical
   notice in the Prolog., p. li., is very brief and meagre. For a German
   translation, see Böckel, pp. 645 sqq.

   The supplementary Scotch Confession of 158O is printed in Vol. III. pp.
   470-475.

   ORIGIN OF THE SCOTCH CONFESSION.

   'The Creed of Scotland and the Church of Scotland emerge into history
   so nearly at the same moment that it is difficult to say which has the
   precedence even in order of time. It is at least equally difficult to
   say which is first in respect of authority; and, indeed; the question
   whether the Church is founded upon the creed or the creed upon the
   Church appears to be at the root of most of the legal difficulties that
   lie before us.' [1314]

   The Reformed Church of Scotland was not legally recognized and
   established by Parliament till 1567, seven years after the Scotch
   Confession was adopted and the first General Assembly was held; but it
   existed in fact, under royal protest, as a voluntary body from December
   3, 1557, when a number of Protestant nobles and gentlemen signed, at
   Edinburgh, a 'Covenant' to maintain, nourish, and defend to the death
   'the whole Congregation of Christ, and every member thereof.' This was
   one of those religious bonds or mutual agreements by which the
   confederation of Protestants of Scotland was so often ratified to
   secure common privileges. The term Congregation (ekklesia, ecclesia),
   which afterwards was exchanged for Kirk (kuriakon), then signified the
   true Church of Christ in opposition to the apostate Papal Church, and
   the leaders were called the 'Lords of the Congregation.' For a few
   years the Liturgy of Edward VI. and the 'Order of Geneva' seem to have
   been used, but there is no record of any formal approval of a doctrinal
   standard before 1560. [1315]

   On the first of August, 1560, after the death of the Queen Regent, Mary
   of Guise, and the expulsion of the French troops, but before the
   arrival of Queen Mary, the Scotch Parliament convened at Edinburgh to
   settle the new state of things in this transition period. It proved to
   be the most important meeting in the history of that kingdom. The
   Church question came up on a petition to abolish popery, to restore the
   purity of worship and discipline, and to devote the ecclesiastical
   revenues to the support of a pious clergy, the promotion of learning,
   and the relief of the poor. In answer to the first request, the
   Parliament directed the Protestant ministers to draw up a Confession of
   Faith. This was done hastily, though not without mature preparation, in
   four days, by John Knox and his compeers. [1316] The document was read
   twice, article by article, and ratified by the three estates, August
   17, 1560, 'as a doctrine grounded upon the infallible Word of God.'
   Every member was requested to vote. The papal bishops were charged to
   object and refute, but they kept silence. The temporal lords all voted
   for the Confession except three, the Earl of Athole, Lord Somerville,
   and Lord Borthwick, who declared as their only reason of dissent, 'We
   will beleve as our fathers belevet.' [1317]

   Randolph, the English envoy, wrote to Cecil two days afterwards: 'I
   never heard matters of so great importance neither sooner dispatched,
   nor with better will agreed unto. . . . The rest of the Lords, with
   common consent and as glad a will as ever I heard men speak, allowed
   the same. . . . Many offered to shed their blood in defense of the
   same. The old Lord Lindsay, as grave and godly a man as ever I saw,
   said, "I have lived many years; I am the oldest in this company of my
   sort; now that it hath pleased God to let me see this day, where so
   many nobles and others have allowed so worthy a work, I will say with
   Simeon, Nunc dimittis."' [1318]

   The adoption of the Confession was followed (Aug. 24, 1560) by acts
   abolishing the mass, the jurisdiction of the pope, and rescinding all
   the laws formerly made in support of the Roman Catholic Church and
   against the Reformed religion. A messenger was dispatched with the
   Confession to Queen Mary, in Paris, to secure her ratification, but was
   not graciously received. Her heart's design was to restore in due time
   her own religion.

   In December of the same year the first General Assembly convened, and
   approved the Book of Discipline, prepared by the same authors. It was
   submitted to the state authority, but this refused to ratify it. [1319]

   Seven years afterwards (1567), the Parliament formally established the
   Reformed Church, by declaring the ministers of the blessed Evangel and
   the people of the realm professing Christ according to the Confession
   of Faith 'to be the only true and holy Kirk of Jesus Christ within this
   realm.' Subscription was required from all ministers first in 1572.
   [1320] From that time till the Revolution of 1688 this native
   Confession was the only legally recognized doctrinal standard of both
   the Presbyterian and Episcopal Churches in Scotland. The Covenanters,
   however, during the Commonwealth, adopted the Westminster standards,
   which have thrown the older Confession into the shade. Besides, the
   General Assembly approved and recommended also the Second Helvetic
   Confession, which Beza transmitted to Scotland (1566), Calvin's
   Catechism, and the Heidelberg Catechism, but no subscription to these
   foreign confessions was ever exacted.

   CONTENTS.

   The Scotch Confession consists of twenty-five Articles, and a short
   Preface, which breathes the spirit of true confessors ready for
   martyrdom. It begins: 'Long have we thirsted, dear brethren, to have
   notified unto the world the sum of that doctrine which we profess, and
   for the which we have sustained infamy and danger;' and it ends with
   the words: 'We firmly purpose to abide to the end in the confession of
   this our faith.' But the authors are far from claiming infallibility
   for their own statements of the truth, and subject them to improvement
   and correction from the Holy Scriptures. [1321] In harmony with this,
   the 20th Article denies the infallibility of general councils, 'some of
   which have manifestly erred, and that in matters of great weight and
   importance.'

   The Confession covers the oecumenical and evangelical doctrines,
   beginning with God and ending with the Church, the Sacraments, and the
   Civil Magistrate. It exhibits a clear, fresh, and forcible summary of
   the orthodox Reformed faith, as then held in common by the Protestants
   of England, Switzerland, France, and Holland. Though decidedly
   Calvinistic, it is yet free from the scholastic technicalities and
   angular statements of the Calvinism of a later generation. The doctrine
   of the Sacraments is similar to and rather stronger than that of the
   Thirty-nine Articles. [1322] The Church is declared to be
   uninterruptedly one from the beginning to the end of the world,' one
   company and multitude of men chosen of God, who rightly worship and
   embrace him by true faith in Christ Jesus, who is the only Head of the
   same Church, which also is the body and spouse of Christ Jesus; which
   Church is catholic, that is, universal, because it containeth the elect
   of all ages, all realms, nations, and tongues, who have communion with
   God the Father, and with his Son, through the sanctification of the
   Holy Spirit.' But this Church is put in strong contrast with the false
   and apostate Church of the Papacy, and distinguished from it by three
   marks-- namely, the pure preaching of the gospel, the right
   administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of ecclesiastical
   discipline. The first two are mentioned in the Augsburg Confession and
   the English Articles; the third is peculiarly Calvinistic and
   Presbyterian.

   But no particular form of Church government or worship is laid down in
   this Confession as binding, and freedom is allowed in ceremonies.
   [1323] Knox himself prepared, after the Geneva model, a liturgy, or
   Book of Common Order, which was indorsed by the General Assembly (Dec.
   26, 1564), and used in Scotland for a long time. [1324] The exclusive
   theory of a jure divino Presbyterianism dates not so much from Knox as
   from Andrew Melville, and the aversion to forms of prayer was a
   reaction against the attempt of Laud to force a foreign episcopacy and
   liturgy upon the reluctant Scotch.

   Edward Irving, himself one of the purest and noblest sons of Scotland,
   who for several years thrilled the English metropolis with his
   pentecostal gift of tongues, and to whom Thomas Carlyle, the friend of
   his youth, paid such a touching tribute, was in the habit of reading
   the Scotch Confession twice in the year to his congregation, and
   bestowed this encomium upon it: [1325] 'This document is the pillar of
   the Reformation Church of Scotland, which hath derived little help from
   the Westminster Confession of Faith: whereas these twenty-five
   articles, ratified in the Parliament of Scotland in the year 1560, not
   only at that time united the states of the kingdom in one firm band
   against the Papacy, but also rallied the people at sundry times of
   trouble and distress for a whole century thereafter, and it may be said
   even until the Revolution, when the Church came into that haven of rest
   which has proved far more pernicious to her than all the storms she
   ever passed through; for, though the Westminster Confession was adopted
   as a platform of communion with the English Presbyterians in the year
   1647, it exerted little or no influence upon our Church, and was hardly
   felt as an operative principle either of good or evil, until the
   Revolution of 1688; so that the Scottish Confession was the banner of
   the Church in all her wrestlings and conflicts, the Westminster
   Confession but as the camp colors which she hath used during her days
   of peace--the one for battle, the other for fair appearance and good
   order. This document consisteth of twenty-five articles, and is written
   in a most honest, straightforward, manly style, without compliment or
   flattery, without affectation of logical precision and learned
   accuracy, as if it came fresh from the heart of laborious workmen, all
   the day long busy with the preaching of the truth, and sitting down at
   night to embody the heads of what was continually taught. There is a
   freshness of life about it which no frequency of reading wears off.'

   [1315] 'The Confession of Faith of the English Congregation at Geneva,'
   1558, consists only of four articles: 1, of God the Father; 2, of Jesus
   Christ; 3, of the Holy Ghost; 4, of the Church and the Communion of
   Saints. It was probably drawn up by Knox. Chaps. 1 and 4 have some
   resemblance to the corresponding articles of the Scotch Confession. It
   is reprinted in Dunlop's Collection, Vol. II. pp. 3-12. The editor says
   that it was 'received and approved by the Church of Scotland in the
   beginning of the Reformation.'

   [1316] Knox reports (Vol. II. p. 128): 'Commission and charge was given
   to Mr. John Winram, sub-prior of St. Andrew's, Mr. John Spottiswoode,
   John Hillock, Mr. John Douglas, rector of St. Andrew's, Mr. John Rowe,
   and John Knox, to draw in a volume the policy and discipline of the
   Kirk, as well as they had done the doctrine.' Thus six Johns composed
   both the Confession of Faith and the Book of Discipline, which breathe
   the spirit of the Church militant, and are Pauline rather than
   Johannean. Knox was no doubt the chief author of both. He had
   experience in the preparation of such documents, as he was consulted
   about the Edwardine Articles of Religion, prepared the Confession for
   the English congregations in Geneva, and must have been familiar with
   the Swiss Confessions.

   [1321] 'We protest that if any one will note in this our Confession any
   article or sentence repugnant to God's Holy Word, that it would please
   him of his gentleness and for Christian charity's sake, to admonish us
   of the same in writing; and we, upon our honor and fidelity, by God's
   grace, do promise unto him satisfaction from the mouth of God (that is,
   from his Holy Scriptures), or else reformation of that which he shall
   prove to be amiss.' Dean Stanley, in quoting this passage from the
   Preface (Lectures, etc. p. 113), says that it is the only Protestant
   Confession which, far in advance of its age, acknowledges its own
   fallibility. But the First Confession of Basle (1534) does the same in
   express words in the closing article (see Niemeyer, Collect. pp. 84 and
   104); and the changes of the Augsburg Confession (Art. X.), and of the
   English Articles, imply the recognition of their imperfection on the
   part of the authors. The 19th Article, in declaring that all Churches
   have erred in matters of faith, could certainly not intend to exempt
   the Church of England and her formularies.

   [1322] Tytler (History of Scotland, Vol. III. p. 129, ed. of 1872)
   observes: 'It is worthy of remark that in these holy mysteries of our
   faith this Confession, drawn up by the primitive Scotch Reformers,
   keeps in some points at a greater distance from the rationalizing of
   ultra-Protestantism than the Articles of Edward.' On Knox's view of the
   eucharist, see Lorimer, 1.c. pp. 129 and 131. He held the Calvinistic
   view before he came to Geneva, and while still a disciple of Wishart,
   who learned it from his intercourse with the Swiss Churches to 1540,
   and translated the First Helvetic Confession of 1536 into English.

   [1323] Art. XX.: 'In the Church, as in the house of God, it becometh
   all things to be done decently and in order: not that we think that one
   policy, and one order of ceremonies can be appointed for all ages,
   times, and places; for as ceremonies, such as men have devised, are but
   temporal, so may and ought they to be changed, when they rather foster
   superstition than edify the Church using the same.'

   [1324] It has been republished by the Rev. John Cumming, London, 1840.
   Cumming says (p. v.): 'The Scotch Church never objected to a written
   liturgy in her public worship, provided there was room left in the
   service for extemporaneous service.' John Knox's Liturgy was never
   formally abolished, but, like the Scotch Confession, it was silently
   superseded by the Westminster standards.

   § 90. The Scotch Covenants and the Scotch Kirk.

   Literature.

   The Covenants are added to some Scotch editions of the Westminster
   Standards. The Solemn League and Covenant was often separately printed.

   James Aikman: An Historical Account of Covenanting in Scotland, from
   the first Band in Mearns, 1556, to the Signature of the Grand National
   Covenant, 1638. Edinburgh, 1848 (82 pp.).


   National Covenants or politico-religious agreements for the maintenance
   and defense of certain principles and privileges are a peculiar and
   prominent feature in the history of the Kirk of Scotland. They were
   copied from Jewish precedents. [1326] They originated in critical
   periods, when the sacred rights and convictions of the people were in
   imminent danger, and when the religious and national sentiments were
   inseparably blended. They are not properly confessions of faith, but
   closely connected with them, and must therefore be noticed here. They
   are solemn pledges to defend the doctrines and polity of the Reformed
   Kirk against all hostile attempts from within or from without, and to
   die rather than surrender. [1327]

   The earlier Covenants were safeguards against popery, the later against
   episcopacy. In the ecclesiastical history of Scotland since the
   Reformation we may distinguish three main periods: the period of
   anti-popery (1560 to 1590), the period of anti-prelacy (until 1690),
   and the period of anti-patronage (until 1875).

   The first Covenants were made for mutual protection against the
   Romanists by a number of Protestant nobles and gentlemen, at Mearns,
   1556, at Edinburgh, Dec. 3, 1557, at Perth, Dec. 31, 1559, before the
   Reformed Kirk was properly organized.

   THE NATIONAL COVENANT, 1581 AND 1638.

   Far more important is the 'National Covenant,' or the 'Second Scotch
   Confession,' also called the 'King's Confession,' and the 'Negative
   Confession.' It was drawn up in English and Latin by the Rev. John
   Craig, a noble, well-educated, and devoted man, a colleague of Knox and
   author of two Catechisms, who, after an eventful and romantic career,
   died in 1600, in the eighty-eight year of his life. It is a solemn
   indorsement of the Confession of Faith of 1560, with the strongest
   possible protest against 'all kind of papistry in general and
   particular heads,' especially against the 'usurped tyranny of the Roman
   Antichrist upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civil
   magistrate, and consciences of men; all his tyrannous laws made upon
   indifferent things, against our Christian liberty; . . . his five
   bastard sacraments, with all his rites, ceremonies, and false doctrine
   added to the ministration of the true sacraments without the Word of
   God; his cruel judgment against infants departing without the
   sacrament; [1328] his absolute necessity of baptism; his blasphemous
   opinion of transubstantiation; his devilish mass; his blasphemous
   priesthood; his profane sacrifice for sins of the dead and the quick; .
   . . his worldly monarchy and wicked hierarchy; his three solemn vows;
   his erroneous and bloody decrees made at Trent, with all the
   subscribers and approvers of that cruel and bloody band conjured
   against the Kirk of God.' No other Protestant Confession is so fiercely
   anti-popish.

   This Covenant was subscribed by King James VI., his household, and a
   number of nobles and ministers, at Edinburgh, Jan. 28, 1581 (or 1580,
   old style [1329] ); then by the Assembly and by persons of all ranks in
   March, 1581; again in 1590, together with a 'General Band for
   Maintenance of the True Religion and the King's Person or Estate;' it
   was solemnly renewed, with additions, in 1638 and 1639; ratified by an
   Act of Parliament in 1640, and signed by King Charles II., in exile, at
   Spey, June 23, 1650, and again when he was crowned at Scone, in
   Scotland, Jan. 1, 1651. [1330]

   The renewal of the Covenant in 1638, which is more particularly called
   the National Covenant, marks the Second Reformation. It includes the
   old Covenant of 1581, the Acts of Parliament condemning popery, and a
   protest against the government of the Kirk by bishops, all those
   measures of King Charles I. which 'do sensibly tend to the
   re-establishment of the Popish religion and tyranny, and to the
   subversion and ruin of the true Reformed religion, and of our
   liberties, laws, and estates.' The additions were prepared by Alexander
   Henderson and Johnston of Warriston, to meet a great crisis. [1331]

   The introduction of the semi-presbyterian mongrel episcopacy of James
   was comparatively harmless. But when his son Charles and his spiritual
   adviser, Archbishop Laud, in criminal ignorance or contempt of public
   feeling, attempted to force upon the Scots the royal supremacy, with a
   Romanizing hierarchy and liturgy, it produced a revolution and civil
   war which extended to England, and culminated in the temporary triumph
   of Puritanism. Macaulay traces the freedom of England to this 'act of
   insane bigotry.' In 1633 Laud displayed the most elaborate pomp of
   ceremonial worship in Holyrood Chapel to impress the descendants of
   John Knox! His new service-book differed from the English in a marked
   tendency to popery. When it was first introduced, July 23, 1637, in the
   cathedral church of St. Giles, in the presence of the privy council,
   the two archbishops of Scotland, several bishops, and the city
   magistrates, a poor old woman, named Jenny Geddes, confounding 'colic'
   and 'collect,' indignantly exclaimed, 'Villain, dost thou say mass at
   my lug,' and hurled her famous stool at the head of the unfortunate
   dean, who read 'the black, popish, and superstitious book.' Instantly
   all was uproar and confusion all over the city. The people shouted
   through the streets, 'A pope, a pope! Antichrist! The sword of the Lord
   and Gideon!' The unpremeditated riot extended into a popular
   revolution. The result was the overthrow of the artificial scheme which
   bigotry and tyranny had concocted. [1332]

   The renewal of the Covenant took place in Greyfriars' Church, in
   Edinburgh, the 28th of February, 1638, and was a most solemn and
   extraordinary scene. No less than sixty thousand people flocked to the
   city from all parts of the kingdom. The dense crowd which filled the
   church and adjoining graveyard listened with breathless attention to
   the prayers, the addresses, and the reading of the Covenant. The aged
   Earl of Sutherland first signed his name with trembling hand upon the
   parchment roll. Name followed name in swift succession. 'Some wept
   aloud; some burst into a shout of exultation; some, after their names,
   added the words, till death; and some, opening a vein, subscribed with
   their own warm blood. As the space became filled, they wrote their
   names in a contracted form, limiting them at last to the initial
   letters, till not a spot remained on which another letter could be
   inscribed. . . . Never, except among God's peculiar people, the Jews,
   did any national transaction equal in moral and religious sublimity
   that which was displayed by Scotland on the great day of her sacred
   National Covenant.' [1333]

   Similar scenes were repeated throughout the Northern Kingdom. Noblemen
   and gentlemen carried copies of the Covenant in their pockets and
   portmanteaus, soliciting subscriptions. Women sat in church day and
   night, from Friday till Sunday, to receive the communion with it. To
   refuse signature seemed to some denial of Christianity itself. [1334]

   THE SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT, 1643.

   'The Solemn League and Covenant for Reformation and Defense of
   Religion, the Honor and Happiness of the King, and the Peace and Safety
   of the Three Kingdoms of Scotland, England, and Ireland,' is the last
   and the most important of these national compacts which grew out of the
   Reformation. It has neither the doctrinal import nor the ring and
   fervor of the National Covenant of 1580 and 1638, but it had a wider
   scope and greater effect. It is anti-episcopal as well as anti-papal.
   It is the connecting link between Scotch Presbyterianism and English
   Puritanism, between the General Assembly and the Westminster Assembly,
   between the Scotch Parliament and the Long Parliament. It aimed to
   secure uniformity of religion in the united realms, while the National
   Covenant, like the Confession of 1560, was purely Scotch, and never
   exceeded its original boundary. [1335]

   We present first the text in full: [1336]

   'We Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses,
   Ministers of the Gospel, and Commons of all sorts, in the kingdoms of
   Scotland, England, and Ireland, by the providence of God, living under
   one King, and being of one reformed religion, having before our eyes
   the glory of God and the advancement of the kingdom of our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ, the honor and happiness of the King's Majesty and
   his posterity, and the true public liberty, safety, and peace of the
   kingdoms, wherein every one's private condition is included: And
   calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots, conspiracies,
   attempts, and practices of the enemies of God, against the true
   religion and professors thereof in all places, especially in these
   three kingdoms, ever since the reformation of religion; and how much
   their rage, power, and presumption are of late and at this time
   increased and exercised, whereof the deplorable state of the Church and
   kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and kingdom of
   England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and kingdom of Scotland
   are present and public testimonies; we have now at last (after other
   means of supplication, remonstrance, protestation, and sufferings, for
   the preservation of ourselves and our religion from utter ruin and
   destruction, according to the commendable practice of these kingdoms in
   former times, and the example of God's people in other nations), after
   mature deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and
   Solemn League and Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of
   us for himself, with our hands lifted up to the most High God, do
   swear,

   'I. That we shall sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace
   of God, endeavor, in our several places and callings, the preservation
   of the reformed religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine,
   worship, discipline, and government, against our common enemies; the
   reformation of religion in the kingdoms of England and Ireland, in
   doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, according to the Word of
   God and the example of the best Reformed Churches; and shall endeavor
   to bring the Churches of God in the three kingdoms to the nearest
   conjunction and uniformity in religion, confession of faith, form of
   Church government, directory for worship and catechising; that we, and
   our posterity after us, may, as brethren, live in faith and love, and
   the Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

   'II. That we shall, in like manner, without respect of persons,
   endeavor the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy (that is, Church government
   by Archbishops, Bishops, their Chancellors and Commissaries, Deans,
   Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other ecclesiastical Officers
   depending on that hierarchy), superstition, heresy, schism,
   profaneness, and whatsoever shall be found to be contrary to sound
   doctrine and the power of godliness; lest we partake in other men's
   sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues; and that
   the Lord may be one, and his name one, in the three kingdoms.

   'III. We shall, with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy, in our
   several vocations, endeavor, with our estates and lives, mutually to
   preserve the rights and privileges of the Parliaments, and the
   liberties of the kingdoms; and to preserve and defend the King's
   Majesty's person and authority, in the preservation and defense of the
   true religion and liberties of the kingdoms; that the world may bear
   witness with our consciences of our loyalty, and that we have no
   thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and
   greatness.

   'IV. We shall also, with all faithfulness, endeavor the discovery of
   all such as have been or shall be incendiaries, malignants, or evil
   instruments, by hindering the reformation of religion, dividing the
   King from his people, or one of the kingdoms from another, or making
   any faction or parties amongst the people, contrary to this League and
   Covenant; that they may be brought to public trial, and receive condign
   punishment, as the degree of their offenses shall require or deserve,
   or the supreme judicatories of both kingdoms respectively, or others
   having power from them for that effect, shall judge convenient.

   'V. And whereas the happiness of a blessed peace between these
   kingdoms, denied in former times to our progenitors, is, by the good
   providence of God, granted unto us, and hath been lately concluded and
   settled by both Parliaments; we shall each one of us, according to our
   place and interest, endeavor that they may remain conjoined in a firm
   peace and union to all posterity, and that justice may be done upon the
   willful opposers thereof, in manner expressed in the precedent article.

   'VI. We shall also, according to our places and callings, in this
   common cause of religion, liberty, and peace of the kingdoms, assist
   and defend all those that enter into this League and Covenant in the
   maintaining and pursuing thereof; and shall not suffer ourselves,
   directly or indirectly, by whatsoever combination, persuasion, or
   terror, to be divided and withdrawn from this blessed union and
   conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give
   ourselves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause
   which so much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the kingdom, and
   honor of the king; but shall, all the days of our lives, zealously and
   constantly continue therein against all opposition, and promote the
   same according to our power against all lets and impediments
   whatsoever; and what we are not able ourselves to suppress or overcome
   we shall reveal and make known, that it may be timely prevented or
   removed: all which we shall do as in the sight of God.

   'And, because these kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations
   against God and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present
   distresses and dangers, the fruits thereof, we profess and declare,
   before God and the world, our unfeigned desire to be humbled for our
   own sins, and for the sins of these kingdoms; especially, that we have
   not as we ought valued the inestimable benefit of the gospel; that we
   have not labored for the purity and power thereof; and that we have not
   endeavored to receive Christ in our hearts nor to walk worthy of him in
   our lives; which are the causes of other sins and transgressions so
   much abounding amongst us; and our true and unfeigned purpose, desire,
   and endeavor for ourselves, and all others under our power and charge,
   both in public and in private, in all duties we owe to God and man, to
   amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a
   real reformation; that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavy
   indignation, and establish these Churches and kingdoms in truth and
   peace.

   'And this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty God, the
   searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as
   we shall answer at that great day when the secrets of all hearts shall
   be disclosed; most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his
   Holy Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires and proceedings with
   such success as may be deliverance and safety to his people and
   encouragement to other Christian Churches, groaning under, or in danger
   of, the yoke of anti-Christian tyranny, to join in the same or like
   association and covenant, to the glory of God, the enlargement of the
   kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the peace and tranquillity of Christian
   kingdoms and commonwealths.'

   The immediate origin of this international politico-religious Covenant
   was the combined application of the English Parliament, then at war
   with King Charles I., and the Westminster Assembly of Divines, then
   sitting under its authority, for the effectual aid of the Scots, who
   occupied a position of neutrality. Six commissioners--four from the
   Parliament (Sir William Armyn, Sir Harry Vane the younger, Mr. Hatcher,
   and Mr. Darley) and two from the Westminster Assembly (Stephen Marshall
   and Philip Nye)--appeared with official and private letters before the
   Scotch Convention of Estates and the General Assembly at Edinburgh, in
   August, 1643. The English desired a civil league; the Scotch were for a
   religious covenant, and made the latter a condition of the former.
   Alexander Henderson, a highly esteemed minister at Edinburgh, Rector of
   the University (since 1640), and then for the third time Moderator of
   the General Assembly, was intrusted with the preparation of the
   document. He had drawn up a part of the National Covenant five years
   before. The English suggested some modifications which gave greater
   prominence to the political feature. The draft was unanimously and
   enthusiastically adopted by the General Assembly and the Scottish
   Convention, Aug. 17, 1643. The people, who had not forgotten the
   Covenant of 1638, manifested their most hearty approval, and went into
   the new engagement with the 'perfervidum ingenium Scotorum.'

   The Solemn League and Covenant became a signal of war and victory in
   the history of Puritanism. It was followed by the appointment of Scotch
   commissioners to the Westminster Assembly, who took a leading part in
   the preparation of the Westminster standards of doctrine, worship, and
   discipline. It was debated for three or four days in that Assembly, and
   approved, with a few verbal alterations, by all the members except the
   Episcopalians. On the 21st of September Parliament ordered it to be
   published and subscribed throughout England. On the 25th of September
   the members of the House of Commons (two hundred and twenty-eight) and
   the divines of the Assembly set the example in St. Margaret's Church,
   [1337] beneath the shadow of Westminster Abbey. It was one of the
   strangest and most solemn events in the history of England. It reminds
   one of the formation of the Swiss Confederacy on the green meadow at
   Grütli. After prayer and addresses by White of Dorchester, Philip Nye,
   and Henderson, the Covenant was read, article by article, from the
   pulpit, and every member, standing up and lifting his right hand to
   heaven, took the pledge, and then signed his name on the rolls of
   parchment. The House of Lords followed a few weeks afterwards (Oct.
   15). The same solemn scene was re-enacted in almost every English town
   and parish where the authority of Parliament prevailed. Cromwell among
   the Commons, and probably, also, Milton as a householder, signed the
   document, though Cromwell afterwards made war on the Scots, and Milton
   came to the conclusion that 'new Presbyter is but old Priest writ
   large.' In vain did the King, from his head-quarters in Oxford, forbid
   the League (Oct. 9), as 'a traitorous and seditious combination against
   himself and the established religion of his kingdom.' It became the
   shibboleth of Puritan religion and patriotism. There were, however,
   some exceptions. England, after all, was not so zealous for
   Presbyterianism as Scotland, and not used to covenanting. Richard
   Baxter raised his voice against the indiscriminate enforcement of the
   Covenant, and prevented its being taken in Kidderminster and the
   neighborhood. [1338]

   From England the tide flowed back to Scotland, and Scotland, stimulated
   by the example, outran the neighboring country in zeal for the League.
   On the 13th of October, 1643, most of the nobles, including eighteen
   members of the Privy Council, solemnly signed it in Edinburgh, and from
   that day on for months there was 'a general swearing to the Covenant'
   by the people of Scotland, as by the Parliamentarians in England, from
   district to district, from city to city, from village to village, from
   parish to parish. [1339]

   'O'er hill and dale the summons flew,

   Nor rest nor pause the herald knew.

   Each valley, each sequester'd glen,

   Mustered its little horde of men,

   That met, as torrents from the height,

   In Highland dales, when streams unite,

   Still gathering as they pour along,

   A voice more loud, a tide more strong.'

   On the 29th of November, 1643, the two countries entered into a treaty,
   by which the Scots promised to furnish an army for the war, the
   expenses to be refunded after the conclusion of peace. The Scots felt
   that they were playing the part of the good Samaritan towards the
   neighbor who had fallen among thieves. 'Surely,' says Baillie, 'it was
   a great act of faith in God, and huge courage and unheard-of
   compassion' on the part of the Scotch nation, 'to hazard their own
   peace and venture their lives and all, for to save a people so
   irrecoverably ruined, both in their own and in all the world's eyes.'

   The united army fought under the banner of the Anglo-Scotch Covenant
   against royal and episcopal tyranny, and for the establishment of
   presbyterian uniformity. The negative end was gained, the positive
   failed. 'Trusting in God and keeping their powder dry,' the Puritans
   overthrew both monarchy and prelacy, but only to be overthrown in turn
   by the Nemesis of history. No human power could bring the two kingdoms
   under one creed and one form of government and worship. Presbyterian
   uniformity in England was as preposterous as Episcopal uniformity in
   Scotland.

   The Solemn League and Covenant was weakened by the quarrel between the
   Presbyterians and Independents, and was virtually broken with the
   destruction of the monarchy and the execution of Charles I. (1648).
   [1340] The English army put down the Covenant which the Scotch army had
   set up. After the Restoration it became an object of intense hatred,
   and was publicly burned by the common hangman in Westminster Hall by
   order of Parliament (1661). Charles II., who had twice sworn both to
   the Solemn League and to the National Covenant as a part of his
   coronation oath in Scotland (June 23, 1650, and Jan. 1, 1651), broke
   his oath as soon as he ascended the English throne, and established the
   royal Supremacy and Episcopacy even in Presbyterian Scotland (1662).
   But the Covenanters fought for the institutions of their fathers with
   the heroic spirit of martyrdom through all those troubled times,

   'Whose memory rings through Scotland to this hour.'

   THE SCOTCH KIRK.

   After severe struggles Prelacy was again overthrown and Presbyterianism
   permanently re-established in Scotland by Parliament in 1690, though
   with a degree of dependence on the state which kept up a constant
   irritation, and which led from time to time to new secessions.

   These secessions from the Established Kirk, down to the great exodus of
   the Free Church in 1843, were no new departures, but, like the sects in
   Russia, returns to the old landmarks. The system of Calvinistic
   Presbyterianism which the great Reformer had established in Geneva
   found in Scotland a larger and more congenial field of action, and
   became there more free and independent of the civil power. It was
   wrought into the bone and sinew of the nation which seems to be
   predestinated for such a manly, sturdy, God-fearing, solid, persevering
   type of Christianity. Romanism in the Highlands is only an unsubdued
   remnant of the Middle Ages, lately reinforced by Irish emigrants to the
   large cities. Episcopacy is an English exotic for Scotchmen educated in
   England and associated with the English aristocracy. The body of the
   people are Presbyterian to the back-bone. The differences between the
   Established Kirk, the United Presbyterians, the Free Church, and the
   smaller secession bodies seem insignificant to an outside observer, and
   turn on questions of psalmody, patronage, and relation to the civil
   government. The vital doctrines and principles are held in common by
   all. Differences of opinion, which in other countries constitute merely
   theological schools or parties in one and the same denomination, give
   rise in Scotland to separate ecclesiastical organizations. The
   scrupulous conscientiousness and stubbornness which clothe minor
   questions with the dignity and grandeur of fundamental principles, and
   are made to justify separation and schism, are the shadow of a virtue.
   Scotland is an unconquerable fort of orthodox Protestantism. In no
   other country and Church do we find such fidelity and tenacity; such
   unswerving devotion to the genius of the Reformation; such union of
   metaphysical subtlety with religious fervor and impetuosity; such
   general interest in ecclesiastical councils and enterprizes; such
   jealousy for the rights and self-government of the Church; such loyalty
   to a particular denomination combined with a generous interest in
   Christ's kingdom at large; such reverence for God's holy Word and holy
   day, that after the hard and honest toil of the week lights up the
   poorest man's cottage on 'Saturday night.'

   The history of Christianity, since the days of the apostles, furnishes
   no brighter chapter of heroic and successful sacrifices for the idea of
   the sole headship of Christ, and the honor and independence of his
   Church, than the Free-Church movement, whose leaders--Chalmers, Welsh,
   Candlish, Cunningham, Duncan, Fairbairn, Guthrie, Buchanan, Arnot--have
   now one by one taken their place among the great and good men of the
   past, but will continue to live in the memory of a grateful people. Dr.
   Norman Macleod, himself one of the noblest of Scotchmen, who was a
   member of the disruption Assembly of 1843, and found it harder to stay
   in the Established Church as 'a restorer of the breach' than to go out
   of it amid the huzzas of popular enthusiasm, honored himself as much as
   Dr. Chalmers, his teacher, when he spoke of him after his death as a
   man 'whose noble character, lofty enthusiasm, and patriotic views will
   rear themselves before the eyes of posterity like Alpine peaks, long
   after the narrow valleys which have for a brief period divided us are
   lost in the far distance of past history.' [1341] In securing liberty
   for itself, the Free Church conferred a blessing upon the mother Church
   by rousing it to greater activity, and setting in motion an agitation
   which resulted in the total abolition of the Law of Patronage by Act of
   Parliament (1875).

   day, and set them a statute and an ordinance at Shechem;' 2 Kings xi.
   17: 'And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the
   people, that they should be the Lord's people;' also Isa. xliv. 5.

   [1327] Dr. M'Crie says of the Scotch Covenants (p. 120): 'Although they
   have been condemned as unwarranted in a religious point of view, and
   dangerous in a political, yet are they completely defensible upon the
   principles both of conscience and policy. A mutual agreement, compact,
   or covenant, is virtually implied in the constitution of every society,
   civil or religious; and the dictates of natural law conspire with the
   declarations of revelation in sanctioning the warrantableness and
   propriety of explicit engagements, about any lawful and important
   matter, and of ratifying these, if circumstances shall require it, by
   formal subscription, and by a solemn appeal to the searcher of hearts.
   By strengthening the motives to fidelity and constancy, and thus
   producing mutual confidence among those who are embarked in the same
   cause, they have proved eminently beneficial in the reformation of
   churches and nations, and in securing the religious and political
   privileges of men. The misapplication of them, when employed in a bad
   cause and for mischievous ends, can be no argument against their use in
   a legitimate way, and for laudable purposes. And the reasoning employed
   to prove that such covenants should not be entered into without the
   permission of rulers would lead to the conclusion that subjects ought
   never to profess a religion to which their superiors are hostile, nor
   make any attempts to obtain the reform of abuses, or the redress of
   grievances, without the consent and approbation of those who are
   interested in their support.' From Scotland the custom of covenanting
   passed to the Puritans in England and New England, and remains to-day
   in the shape of solemn engagements assumed by individual Christians
   when they enter into full communion with a church. Such covenants take
   the place of confirmation vows customary in the Lutheran and Anglican
   Churches.

   [1328] This is the first confessional declaration against the
   damnation, and, by implication, in favor of the salvation, of
   unbaptized infants; and agrees with the private opinion previously
   expressed by Zwingli and Bullinger.

   § 91. The Scotch Catechisms.

   Catechetical instruction became soon after the Reformation, and remains
   to this day, one of the fundamental institutions of Presbyterian
   Scotland, and accounts largely for the general diffusion of religious
   information among the people.

   The First Book of Discipline, adopted in 1560, prescribes public
   catechising of the children before the people on Sunday afternoon. The
   General Assembly of 1570 ordered ministers and elders to give to all
   the children within their parishes three courses of religious
   instruction--when they were nine, twelve, and fourteen years of age.
   Later assemblies enacted similar laws, and enjoined it also upon the
   heads of families to catechise their children and servants. The
   Assembly of 1649 renewed the act of the Assembly of 1639 'for a day of
   weeklie catechising, to be constantly observed in every kirk.' [1342]

   The older Catechisms, both domestic and foreign, contain the same
   system of doctrine in a fresher though less logical form than the
   Westminster standards, by which they were superseded after the middle
   of the seventeenth century. 'Our Scottish Catechisms,' says Dr. Bonar,
   the hymnist,' though gray with the antiquity of three centuries, are
   not yet out of date. They still read well, both as to style and
   substance; it would be hard to amend them, or to substitute something
   better in their place. Like some of our old church-bells, they have
   retained for centuries their sweetness and amplitude of tone
   unimpaired. It may be questioned whether the Church has gained any
   thing by the exchange of the Reformation standards for those of the
   seventeenth century. . . . In the Reformation we find doctrine, life,
   action nobly blended. Between these there was harmony, not antagonism;
   for antagonism in such cases can only arise when the parts are
   disproportionately mingled. Subsequently the balance was not preserved:
   the purely dogmatical preponderated. This was an evil, yet an evil not
   so easily avoided as some think; for, as the amount of error flung upon
   society increased, the necessity for encountering it increased also;
   controversy spread, dialectics rose into repute, and the dogmatical
   threatened to stifle or dispossess the vital.' [1343]

   FOREIGN CATECHISMS.

   The Catechism of Calvin and the Palatinate or Heidelberg Catechism were
   approved by the Church of Scotland, and much used in the sixteenth and
   seventeenth centuries. [1344]

   An English edition of the former by the translators of the Geneva Bible
   appeared first at Geneva, 1556, for the use of the congregation of
   exiles, of which Knox was pastor, and then at Edinburgh, 1564. The
   latter was printed in Edinburgh, 1591, 1615, and 1621.

   NATIVE CATECHISMS.

   The number of these must have been very large. King James remarked at
   the Hampton Court Conference that in Scotland every son of a good woman
   thought himself competent to write a Catechism. We mention only those
   which had ecclesiastical sanction:

   1. Two Catechisms of John Craig (1512-1600), an eminent minister at
   Aberdeen, and then at Edinburgh. [1345] He was the author of the Second
   Scotch Confession. [1346]

   The Larger Catechism of Craig was first printed in Edinburgh, by Henrie
   Charteris, in 1581, and in London, 1589. The General Assembly of 1590
   indorsed it, and ordered an abridgment by the author, which was
   approved and published in 1591. In this shorter form it was generally
   used till superseded by the Westminster Catechism. The author says in
   the Preface (dated July 20, 1581): 'First, I have abstained from all
   curious and hard questions; and, next, I have brought the questions and
   the answers to as few words as I could, and that for the ease of
   children and common people, who can not understand nor gather the
   substance of a long question or a long answer confirmed with many
   reasons.' The work begins with some historical questions, and then
   explains the Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord's
   Prayer, and ends with the means of grace and the way of salvation. The
   questions and answers are short, and of almost equal length. We give
   some specimens from the larger work; which is little known:

   First Questions.

   Ques. Who made man and woman?

   Ans. The eternal God of his goodness.

   Ques. Whereof made he them?

   Ans. Of an earthly body and an heavenly spirit.

   Ques. To whose image made he them?

   Ans. To his own image.

   Ques. What is the image of God?

   Ans. Perfect uprightness in body and soul.

   Ques. To what end were they made?

   Ans. To acknowledge and serve their Maker.

   Of the Sacraments.

   Ques. What is a Sacrament?

   Ans. A sensible sign and seal of God's favor offered and given to us.

   Ques. To what end are the Sacraments given?

   Ans. To nourish our faith in the promise of God.

   Ques. How can sensible signs do this?

   Ans. They have this office of God, not of themselves.

   Ques. How do the Sacraments differ from the Word?

   Ans. They speak to the eye, and the Word to the ear.

   Ques. Speak they other things than the Word?

   Ans. No, but the same diversely.

   Ques. But the word doth teach us sufficiently?

   Ans. Yet the Sacraments with the Word do it more effectually.

   Ques. What, then, are the Sacraments to the Word?

   Ans. They are sure and authentic seals given by God.

   Ques. May the Sacraments be without the Word?

   Ans. No, for the Word is their life.

   Ques. May the Word be fruitful without the Sacraments?

   Ans. Yes, no doubt, but it worketh more plenteously with them.

   Ques. What is the cause of that?

   Ans. Because more senses are moved to the comfort of our faith.

   Baptism.

   Ques. What is the signification of baptism?

   Ans. Remission of our sins and regeneration.

   Ques. What similitude hath baptism with remission of sins?

   Ans. As washing cleanseth the body, so Christ's blood our souls.

   Ques. Wherein doth this cleansing stand?

   Ans. In putting away of sin, and imputation of justice.

   Ques. Wherein standeth our regeneration?

   Ans. In mortification and newness of life.

   Ques. How are these things sealed up in baptism?

   Ans. By laying on of water.

   Ques. What doth the laying on of the water signify?

   Ans. Our dying to sin and rising to righteousness.

   Ques. Doth the external washing work these things?

   Ans. No, it is the work of God's Holy Spirit only.

   Ques. Then the sacrament is a bare figure?

   Ans. No, but it hath the verity joined with it.

   Ques. Do all men receive these graces with the Sacraments?

   Ans. No, but only the faithful.

   The Lord's Supper.

   Ques. What signifieth the Lord's Supper to us?

   Ans. That our souls are fed with the body and blood of Christ.

   Ques. Why is this represented by bread and wine?

   Ans. Because what the one doth to the body, the same doth the other to
   the soul spiritually.

   Ques. But our bodies are joined corporally with the elements, or
   outward signs?

   Ans. Even so our souls be joined spiritually with Christ his body.

   Ques. What need is there of this union with him?

   Ans. Otherwise we can not enjoy his benefits.

   Ques. Declare that in the Sacrament?

   Ans. As we see the elements given to feed our bodies, even so we see by
   faith Christ gave his body to us to feed our souls.

   Ques. Did he not give it upon the Cross for us?

   Ans. Yes, and here he giveth the same body to be our spiritual food,
   which we receive and feed on by faith.

   Ques. How receive we his body and blood?

   Ans. By our own lively faith only.

   Ques. What followeth upon this receiving by faith?

   Ans. That Christ dwelleth in us, and we in him.

   Ques. Then we receive only the tokens, and not his body?

   Ans. We receive his very substantial body and blood by faith.

   Ques. How can that be proved?

   Ans. By the truth of his Word, and nature of a Sacrament.

   Ques. But his natural body is in heaven?

   Ans. I no doubt, but yet we receive it in earth by faith.

   Ques. How can that be?

   Ans. By the wonderful working of the Holy Spirit.

   Cause and Progress of Salvation.

   Ques. Out of what fountain doth this our stability flow?

   Ans. Out of God's eternal and constant [unchanging] election in Christ.

   Ques. By what way cometh this election to us?

   Ans. By his effectual calling in due time.

   Ques. What worketh this effectual calling in us?

   Ans. The obedience of faith.

   Ques. What thing doth faith work?

   Ans. Our perpetual and inseparable union with Christ.

   Ques. What worketh this union with Christ?

   Ans. A mutual communion with him and his graces.

   Ques. What worketh this communion?

   Ans. Remission of sins and imputation of justice.

   Ques. What worketh remission of sins and imputation of justice?

   Ans. Peace of conscience and continual sanctification.

   Ques. What worketh sanctification?

   Ans. The hatred of sin and love of godliness.


   2. A Latin Catechism, entitled Rudimenta Pietatis and Summula
   Catechismi, for the use of grammar schools. [1347] It is ascribed to
   Andrew Simpson, who was master of the grammar school at Perth, and the
   first Protestant minister at Dunbar. It was used in the high-school at
   Edinburgh down to 1710.

   Besides this, the Latin editions of the Heidelberg Catechism and
   Calvin's Catechism (translated by Patrick Adamson) were also in use.

   3. The Catechism of John Davidson, minister at Salt-Preston, approved
   by the Provincial Assembly of Lowthiane and Tweddale, 1599. [1348]

   4. A metrical Catechism by the Wedderburns in the time of Knox. [1349]
   The sentiment is better than the poetry. The Reformation in Scotland,
   as well as in France and Holland, called forth metrical versions of the
   Psalms, while in Germany it produced original hymns. The gospel was
   sung as well as preached into the hearts of the common people. But a
   Catechism is for instruction, and requires plain, clear, precise
   statements for common comprehension.

   Literature.

   1. Sources.

   1. The Parliamentary Acts, the Minutes and Standards of the Westminster
   Assembly, the royal Proclamations, Cromwell's Letters, Milton's state
   papers, and other public documents. See the State Calendars;
   Rushworth's Collection (1616-1648); Cardwell's Documentary Annals of
   the Church of England (1546-1716); Camden's Annals of James I. (with
   the king's own works); Winwood's Memorials of State; and the literature
   mentioned in § 93 and § 94.

   2. The private writings of the Episcopal and Puritan divines during the
   reigns of Elizabeth and the Stuarts, too numerous even to classify.
   Much material for history may be drawn from the works of Archbishop
   Laud (b. 1573, beheaded 1645), especially his Diary (in the first vol.
   of his Remains, publ. by H. Wharton, 1695-1700, in 2 vols. fol., and in
   the Anglo-Catholic Library, Oxford, 1847-1850, 5 vols.), and of Richard
   Baxter (1615-1691), especially in the Narrative of his Life and Times
   (publ. by Sylvester, 1696, under the title Reliquiæ Baxterianæ, in 1
   vol. fol., and by Dr. Calamy, 1713, in 4 vols., and in ed. of his
   Practical Works, Lond. 1830, 23 vols. Baxter's numerous controversial
   tracts have never been collected, and have gone, with his medical
   prescriptions, to 'everlasting rest,' but his practical works will
   last). Mrs. Lucy Hutchinson's Memoirs of (her husband) Colonel
   Hutchinson, with Original Anecdotes of many of his most Distinguished
   Contemporaries, and a Summary Review of Public Affairs (publ. from MS.
   7th ed. Lond. 1848), present an admirable picture of the inner and
   private life of the Puritans.

   3. Innumerable controversial pamphlets and tracts for the times, which
   did the work of the newspapers of to-day. From 1640 to 1660 no less
   than 30,000 pamphlets on Church government alone are said to have
   appeared. Milton's tracts surpass all others in eloquence and force.

   PROTESTANTISM AND CIVIL WARS.

   The Reformation has often been charged by Roman Catholic writers with
   being the mother of the bloody civil wars which grew out of the close
   union of Church and State, and which devastated Europe for more than a
   century. But the fault is primarily on the side of Rome. Exclusiveness
   and intolerance are fundamental principles of her creed, and
   persecution her consistent practice wherever she has the power. In
   Italy and Spain Protestantism was strangled in its cradle. In Bohemia,
   Hungary, and Poland it was reduced to a struggling minority by the
   civil sword and the Jesuit intrigues. In France it barely escaped
   annihilation in the massacre of the night of St. Bartholomew, which the
   pope hailed with a Te Deum; and after fighting its way to the throne,
   and acquiring the limited toleration of the Edict of Nantes, it was
   again persecuted almost to extermination by the most Catholic King
   Louis XIV. In Switzerland the war between the Catholic and Reformed
   Cantons, in which Zwingli fell, fixed the boundaries of the two
   religions on a basis of equality. Germany had to pass through the
   fearful ordeal of the Thirty-Years' War, which destroyed nearly one
   half of its population, but ended, in spite of the protest of the pope,
   with the legal recognition of the Lutheran and Reformed Confessions by
   the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. The United Provinces of Holland came
   out victorious from the long and bloody struggle with the tyranny and
   bigotry of Spain. Scotland fought persistently and successfully against
   popery and prelacy. England, after the permanent establishment of the
   Reformation under Elizabeth, was shaken to the base by an internal
   conflict, not between Protestants and foreign Romanists, but between
   Protestants and native Romanizers, ultra-Protestant Puritans and
   semi-Catholic Churchmen.

   This conflict marks the most important period in the Church history of
   that island; it called forth on both sides its deepest moral and
   religious forces; it made England at last the stronghold of
   constitutional liberty in Europe, and laid the foundations for a
   Protestant republic in America. The Puritans were the pioneers in this
   struggle in Old England, and the fathers of New England beyond the sea.
   As the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church, so freedom is the
   sweet fruit of bitter persecution.

   CHARACTER OF PURITANISM.

   Puritanism--an honorable name, etymologically and historically, though
   originally given in reproach, [1350] like Pietism and Methodism--aimed
   at a radical purification and reconstruction of Church and State on the
   sole basis of the Word of God, without regard to the traditions of men.
   It was a second Reformation, as bold and earnest as the first, but less
   profound and comprehensive, and more radical in its antagonism to the
   mediæval Church. It was a revolution, and ran into the excesses of a
   revolution, which called forth, by the natural law of reaction, the
   opposite excesses of a reactionary restoration; but it differs from
   more recent revolutions by the predominance of the religious motive and
   aim. The English Puritans, the Scotch Covenanters, and the French
   Huguenots were alike spiritual descendants of Calvin, and represent,
   with different national characteristics, the same heroic faith and
   severe discipline. They were alike animated by the fear of God, which
   made them strong and free. They bowed reverently before his holy Word,
   but before no human authority. In their eyes God alone was great.

   The Puritans were no separate organization or sect, but the advanced
   wing of the national Church of England, and at one time they became the
   national Church itself, treating their opponents as Nonconformists, as
   they had been treated by them before, and as they were treated
   afterwards in turn. Conformity and Nonconformity were relative terms,
   which each party construed in its own way and for its own advantage.
   The Puritan ministers were educated at Oxford and Cambridge, and had
   bishops, deans, and professors of theology among their leaders and
   sympathizers. Their intention was not to secede, but simply to reform
   still further the national Church in the interest of primitive purity
   and simplicity by legislative and executive sovereignty. The tyrannical
   measures of the ruling party drove them to greater opposition, and a
   large portion of them into complete independency and the advocacy of
   toleration and freedom. But originally they were as intolerant and
   exclusive as their opponents. The common error of both was that they
   held to a close union of Church and State, and aimed at one national
   Church, to which all citizens must conform.

   ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE CONTROVERSY.

   'Nonconformity,' says Thomas Fuller in his quaint and pithy way, 'was
   conceived in the days of King Edward, born in the reign of Queen Mary
   (but beyond the sea, at Frankfort-on-the-Main), nursed and weaned in
   the reign of Elizabeth, grew up a youth or tall stripling under King
   James, and shot up under Charles I. to the full strength and stature of
   a man able not only to cope with, but to conquer the hierarchy, its
   adversary.'

   The open conflict between Puritanism and High-Churchism dates from the
   closing years of the sixteenth century, but its roots may be traced to
   the beginning of the Reformation, which embraced two distinct
   tendencies--one semi-Catholic, conservative and aristocratic; the other
   anti-Catholic, radical and democratic.

   The aristocratic politico-ecclesiastical movement, headed by the
   monarch and the bishops, grew out of the mediæval conflict of the
   English crown and Parliament with the foreign papacy, and effected
   under Henry VIII. the national independence of the English Church, and
   under Edward VI. a positive though limited reformation in doctrine and
   ritual.

   The democratic religious movement, which sprang from the desire of the
   people after salvation and unobstructed communion with God and the
   Bible, had its forerunners in Wycliffe and the Lollards, and was
   nurtured by Tyndale's English Testament, the writings of the
   Continental Reformers, and the personal contact of the Marian exiles
   with Bullinger and Calvin. At first it was nearly crushed under Henry
   VIII., who would not even tolerate the circulation of the English
   Bible; but it gained considerable influence under Edward VI., passed
   through a baptism of blood under Mary, and became a strong party under
   Elizabeth. It included a number of bishops, pervaded the universities,
   and was backed by the sympathies of the common people as they were
   gradually weaned from the traditions of popery.

   Under Edward VI. the martyr-bishop Hooper, of Gloucester, a friend of
   Bullinger, and one of the fathers of Puritanism, opened the ritualistic
   controversy by refusing to be consecrated in the sacerdotal garments,
   and to take the customary episcopal oath, which included an appeal to
   the saints. He was quieted by the representations of the young king, of
   Bucer, and Peter Martyr, who regarded those externals as things
   indifferent; but he continued to strive after 'an entire purification
   of the Church from the very foundation.'

   Under Queen Mary the conflict continued in the prisons and around the
   fires of Smithfield, and was transferred to the Continent with the
   English exiles, such as Jewel, Grindal, Sandys, Pilkington, Parkhurst,
   Humphrey, Sampson, Whittingham, Coverdale, Cox, Nowel, Foxe, Horn, and
   Knox. It produced an actual split in the congregation at
   Frankfort-on-the-Main. There it turned on the question of the
   Prayer-Book of Edward VI., whether it should be adhered to, or reformed
   still further after the model of the simpler worship of Zurich and
   Geneva. The episcopal and liturgical party was led by Dr. Cox
   (afterwards bishop of Ely), and formed the majority; the Puritan party
   was headed by John Knox, who was required to leave, and organized
   another congregation of exiles at Geneva.

   After the accession of Elizabeth both parties flocked back to their
   native land, and forgot the controversy for a while in the common zeal
   for the re-establishment of Protestantism. As long as the ruling powers
   favored the Reformation the Puritans were satisfied, and heartily
   co-operated in every step. Though badly treated by the proud queen,
   they were to the last among her most loyal subjects, and prayed even in
   their dungeons for her welfare. They overlooked her faults for her
   virtues. They were the strongest supporters of the government and the
   crown against popish plots and foreign aggression, and helped to defeat
   the Spanish Armada, whose 'proud shipwrecks' were scattered over 'the
   Northern Ocean even to the frozen Thule.' But when the anti-Romish
   current stopped, and the Church of England seemed to settle down in a
   system of compromise between Rome and Geneva, fortified and hedged in
   by a cruel penal code against every dissent, the radicals assumed an
   antagonistic attitude of nonconformity against the rigorous enforcement
   of conformity, and stood up for the rights of conscience and the
   progress of ecclesiastical reform.

   The controversy was renewed in different ways, between Cartwright and
   Whitgift, and between Travers and Hooker. In both cases the combatants
   were unequally matched: Cartwright, the father of Presbyterianism, was
   a much abler man than Archbishop Whitgift, the father of High-Church
   episcopacy; while Hooker, the Master of the Temple, far excelled
   Travers, the Lecturer at the Temple, in learning and depth. Here the
   question was chiefly whether the Scriptures as interpreted by private
   judgment, or the Scriptures as interpreted by the fathers of the
   primitive Church, should be the rule of faith and discipline. With this
   was connected another question--whether the Roman Church had lost the
   character of a Christian Church, and was therefore to be wholly
   disowned, or whether she was still a true though corrupt Church, with
   valid ordinances, coming down through an unbroken historical
   succession. The Puritans advocated Scripture Christianity versus
   historical Christianity, Hooker historical Christianity as consistent
   with Scripture Christianity. But in substance of doctrine both parties
   were Augustinians and Calvinists, with this difference, that the
   Puritans were high Calvinists, the Churchmen low Calvinists. Whitgift
   advocated even the Lambeth Articles, and Hooker adopted them with some
   modifications. Arminianism did not make its appearance in England till
   the close of the reign of James.

   THE HAMPTON COURT CONFERENCE.

   The accession of James I. (1603-1625) marks a new epoch. He was no
   ordinary man. His learning ranged from the mysteries of predestination
   to witchcraft and tobacco; he had considerable shrewdness, mother-wit,
   ready repartee, and uncommon sense, but little common-sense, and no
   personal dignity nor moral courage; he was given to profanity,
   intemperance, and dissimulation. His courtiers and bishops lauded him
   as the Solomon of his age, but Henry IV. of France characterized him
   better as 'the wisest fool in Christendom.' He was brought up in the
   school of Scotch Presbyterianism, subscribed the Scotch Confession, and
   once said of the Anglican liturgy that 'it is an ill-said mass in
   English.' But the Stuart blood was in him, and when he arrived in
   England he felt relieved of his tormentors, who 'pulled his sleeve as
   they administered their blunt rebukes to him,' and was delighted by the
   adulation of prelates who had much higher notions of royalty than
   Scotch presbyters.

   He lost no time in showing his true character. He answered the famous
   Millenary (or Millemanus) petition, signed by nearly a thousand Puritan
   ministers, and asking for the reform of certain abuses and offenses in
   worship and discipline, [1351] by the imprisonment of ten petitioners
   on the ground that their act tended to sedition and treason, although
   it contained no demand inconsistent with the established Church. Thus
   the opportunity for effecting a compromise was lost. He agreed,
   however, to a Conference, which suited his ambition for the display of
   his learning and wit in debate.

   The Conference was held January 14, 16, and 18, 1604 (old style, 1603),
   at Hampton Court. The persons summoned were nine bishops, headed by
   Archbishop Whitgift of Canterbury and Bishop Bancroft of London, and
   eight deans, on the part of the Conformists, and four of the most
   learned and moderate Puritan divines, under the lead of Dr. John
   Reynolds, President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. [1352] The King
   himself acted both as moderator and judge, and took the leading part in
   the discussion. He laid down his famous pet-principle (which he called
   his 'aphorism'), 'No bishop, no king;' [1353] and, after browbeating
   the Puritans, used as his final argument, 'I will make them conform
   themselves, or else I will harry them out of the land, or else do
   worse.'

   Archbishop Whitgift was so profoundly impressed with the King's
   theological wisdom that be said, 'Undoubtedly your Majesty speaks by
   the special assistance of God's Spirit;' and Bishop Bancroft, of London
   (who first proclaimed the doctrine of a jure divino episcopacy),
   thanked God on his knees that of his singular mercy he had given to
   them 'such a king, as since Christ's time the like hath not been.' The
   same haughty prelate rudely interrupted Dr. Reynolds, one of the most
   learned men in England, saying, 'May your Majesty be pleased that the
   ancient canon be remembered--Schismatici contra episcopos non sunt
   audiendi; and there is another decree of a very ancient council, that
   no man should be admitted to speak against that whereunto he hath
   formerly subscribed. And as for you, Doctor Reynolds, and your
   associates, how much are ye bound to his Majesty's clemency, permitting
   you, contrary to the statute primo Elizabethæ, so freely to speak
   against the liturgy or discipline established.'

   Fuller remarks 'that the King in this famous Conference went beyond
   himself, that the Bishop of London (when not in a passion) appeared
   even with himself, and that Dr. Reynolds fell much beneath himself.'
   The Nonconformists justly complained that the King invited their
   divines, not to have their scruples satisfied, but his pleasure
   propounded--not to hear what they had to say, but to inform them what
   he would do. Hallam, viewing the Conference calmly from his stand-point
   of constitutional history, says: 'In the accounts that we read of this
   meeting we are alternately struck with wonder at the indecent and
   partial behavior of the King and at the baseness of the bishops, mixed,
   according to the custom of servile natures, with insolence toward their
   opponents. It was easy for a monarch and eighteen churchmen to claim
   the victory, be the merits of their dispute what they might, over four
   abashed and intimidated adversaries.' [1354]

   The Conference, however, had one good and most important result--the
   revision of our English Bible. The revision was suggested and urged by
   Dr. Reynolds, who was subsequently appointed one of the revisers,
   [1355] and it was ordered to be executed by King James, from whom it
   has its name. [1356]

   With all his high notions about royalty, James had not the moral
   courage to carry them into full practice, and with all his high notions
   about episcopacy, he had no sympathy with Arminianism, but actually
   countenanced the Calvinistic Presbyterian Synod of Dort, and sent five
   delegates to it, among them a bishop. In both these respects Charles
   went as far beyond James as Laud went beyond Whitgift and Bancroft.

   KING CHARLES AND ARCHBISHOP LAUD.

   The antagonism was intensified and brought to a bloody issue under
   Charles I. (1625-1649) and William Laud. They belong to the most lauded
   and the most abused persons in history, and have been set down by
   opposite partisans among the saints and among the monsters. They were
   neither. They were good men in private life, but bad men in public.
   They might have been as respected and useful in a humble station, or in
   another age or country, as they were hateful and hurtful at the helm of
   government in Protestant England. It was their misfortune rather than
   their crime that they were utterly at war with the progressive spirit
   of their age. Both were learned, cultured, devout gentlemen and
   churchmen, but narrow, pedantic, reactionary, haughty aristocrats. The
   one was constitutionally a tyrant, the other constitutionally a pope or
   an inquisitor-general. They fairly represented in congenial alliance
   the principle and practice of political and ecclesiastical absolutism,
   and the sovereign contempt for the rights of the people, whose sole
   duty in their opinion was passive obedience. Kingcraft and priestcraft
   based upon divine right was their common shibboleth. By their suicidal
   follies they destroyed the very system which they so long defended with
   a rod of iron, and thus they became the benefactors of Protestantism,
   which they labored to destroy. Both died as martyrs of despotism, and
   their last days were their best. 'Nothing in life became them as the
   leaving it.'

   Charles wanted to rule without a Parliament; he did so, in fact, for
   more than eleven years, and the four Parliaments which he was compelled
   to convoke he soon arbitrarily dissolved (1625, 1626, 1629, and 1640).
   He preferred ship-money to legal taxation. He made himself intolerable
   by his duplicity and treachery. 'Faithlessness was the chief cause of
   his disasters, and is the chief stain on his memory. He was in truth
   impelled by an incurable propensity to dark and crooked ways. It may
   seem strange that his conscience, which on occasions of little moment
   was sufficiently sensitive, should never have reproached him with this
   great vice. But there is reason to believe that he was perfidious, not
   only from constitution and from habit, but also on principle. He seems
   to have learned from theologians whom he most esteemed that between him
   and his subjects there could be nothing of the nature of mutual
   contract; and that he could not, even if he would, divest himself of
   his despotic authority; and that in every promise which he made there
   was an implied reservation that such promise might be broken in case of
   necessity, and that of the necessity he was the sole judge.' [1357]

   William Laud [1358] rose, like Cardinal Wolsey, by his abilities and
   the royal favor from humble origin to the highest positions in Church
   and State. He began his career of innovation early at Oxford, and
   asserted in his exercise for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (1604)
   the absolute necessity of baptism for salvation, and the necessity of
   diocesan episcopacy, not only for the well-being, but for the very
   existence of the Church. This position exposed him to the charge of
   heresy, and no one would speak to him in the street. Under James he was
   kept back, [1359] but under Charles he rose rapidly, and after the
   death of Abbot, who was a Puritan, he succeeded him in the primacy of
   the English Church. When he crossed the Thames to take possession of
   Lambeth, he met with an ominous accident, which he relates in his Diary
   (Sept. 18, 1633). The overloaded ferry-boat upset, and his coach sank
   to the bottom of the river, but he was saved as by water, and 'lost
   neither man nor horse.'

   Laud was of small stature [1360] and narrow mind, but strong will and
   working-power, hot and irascible in temper, ungracious and unpopular in
   manner, ignorant of human nature, a zealous ritualist, a pedantic
   disciplinarian, and an overbearing priest. He was indefatigable and
   punctilious in the discharge of his innumerable duties as archbishop
   and prime minister, member of the courts of Star-Chamber and
   High-Commission, of the committee of trade, the foreign committee, and
   as lord of the treasury. He was for a number of years almost omnipotent
   and omnipresent in three kingdoms, looking after every appointment and
   every executive detail in Church and State. [1361]

   His chief zeal was directed to the establishment of absolute outward
   uniformity in religion as he understood it, without regard to the
   rights of conscience and private judgment. His religion consisted of
   High-Church Episcopalianism and Arminianism in the nearest possible
   approach to Rome, which he admired and loved, and the furthest possible
   distance from Geneva, which he hated and abhorred. [1362] But while
   Arminianism in Holland was a protestant growth, and identified with the
   cause of liberal progress, Laud made it subservient to his intolerant
   High-Churchism, and liked it for its affinity with the Semipelagianism
   of the Greek fathers. To enforce this Semipelagian High-Churchism, and
   to secure absolute uniformity in the outward service of God in the
   three kingdoms, was the highest aim of his administration, to which he
   bent every energy. He could not conceive spiritual unity without
   external uniformity. This was his fundamental error. In a
   characteristic sermon which he preached at Westminster before
   Parliament, March 17, 1628, on unity in Church and State (Eph. iv. 3),
   he says: 'Unity of any kind will do much good; but the best is safest,
   and that is unity of the Spirit. . . . The way to keep unity both in
   Church and State is for the governors to carry a watchful eye over all
   such as are discovered or feared to have private ends. . . . Provide
   for the keeping of unity, and . . . God will bless you with the success
   of this day. For this day, the seventeenth of March, Julius Cæsar
   overthrew Sextus Pompeius. . . . And this very day, too, Frederick II.
   entered Jerusalem, and recovered whatsoever Saladin had taken from the
   Christians. But I must tell you, these emperors and their forces were
   great keepers of unity.' [1363]

   In the same year he caused the Royal Declaration to be added to the
   Thirty-nine Articles to check their Calvinistic interpretation. [1364]
   From the same motive he displaced, through the agency of Wentworth and
   Bramhall, the Calvinistic Irish Articles, and neutralized the influence
   of Archbishop Ussher in Ireland. But the height of his folly, and the
   beginning of his fall, was the enforcement of his episcopal and
   ritualistic scheme upon Presbyterian Scotland in criminal defiance of
   the will of the people and the law of the land. This brought on the
   Scotch Covenant and hastened the Civil War.

   In England he filled all vacancies with Churchmen and Arminians of his
   own stamp. He kept (as he himself informs us in his Diary) a ledger for
   the guidance of his royal master in the distribution of patronage:
   those marked by the letter O (Orthodox) were recommended to all favors,
   those marked P (Puritans) were excluded from all favors. Bishop Morely,
   on being asked what the Arminians held, wittily and truthfully replied,
   'The best bishoprics and deaneries in England.' He expelled or silenced
   the Puritans, and shut up every unauthorized meeting-house. 'Even the
   devotions of private families could not escape the vigilance of his
   spies.' In his eyes the Puritans were but a miserable 'fraction' of
   fanatics and rebels, a public nuisance which must be crushed at any
   price. He made the congregations of French and Dutch refugees conform
   or leave the land, and forbade the English ambassador in Paris to
   attend the service of the Huguenots. He restrained the press and the
   importation of foreign books, especially the favorite Geneva
   translation of the Bible prepared by the Marian exiles. He stopped
   several ships in the Thames which were to carry persecuted and
   disheartened Puritans to New England, and thus tried to prevent
   Providence from writing the American chapter in history. In this way
   Oliver Cromwell is said to have been kept at home, that in due time he
   might overthrow the monarchy.

   With equal rigor Laud enforced his ritualism, which was to him not only
   a desirable matter of taste and propriety, but also an essential
   element of reverence and piety. He took special care and showed great
   liberality for the restoration of cathedrals and the full cathedral
   service with the most pompous ceremonial; he made it a point of vital
   importance that the communion-tables be removed from the centre of the
   church to the east end of the chancel, elevated above the level of the
   pavement, placed altar-ways, railed in, and approached always with the
   prescribed bows and genuflexions [1365] He called the altar 'the
   greatest place of God's residence on earth,' and magnified it above the
   pulpit, because on the altar was Christ's body, which was more than his
   Word; but he denied the charge of transubstantiation. He introduced
   pictures, images, crucifixes, candles, and brought put every worn-out
   relic from the ecclesiastical wardrobe of the Middle Ages. Being
   himself unmarried, he preferred celibates in the priesthood. In the
   University of Oxford, to which he was a munificent benefactor, he was
   addressed as His Holiness, and Most Holy father.

   No wonder that he was charged with the intention to reintroduce popery
   into England. The popular mind, especially in times of excitement,
   takes no notice of minor shades of distinction, and knows only friend
   and foe. Laud, no doubt, did the pope's work effectually, but he did it
   unintentionally. He loved the Roman Church much better than the
   Protestant sects, but he loved the Anglican Church more. He once
   dreamed, as he tells us, 'that he was reconciled to the Church of
   Rome,' but was much troubled by it. [1366] He was twice offered, by
   some unnamed agent, a cardinal's hat, but promptly declined it. [1367]
   He preferred to be an independent pope in England, and aped the Roman
   original as well as he could, with more or less show of real or
   imaginary opposition that springs from rivalry and affinity. Neal says
   that he was not 'an absolute papist,' but 'ambitious of being the
   sovereign patriarch of three kingdoms.' [1368] From his 'Conference'
   with Fisher the Jesuit, which is by far his ablest and most learned
   performance, it is very evident that he differed from Rome on several
   points of doctrine and practice, such as the invocation of Mary and the
   saints, the worship of images, transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the
   mass, works of supererogation, the temporal power of the pope, and the
   infallibility of councils; and that his mind, though clear and acute,
   was not sufficiently logical to admit the ultimate conclusions of some
   of his own premises. [1369] He regarded the Reformation merely as an
   incident in the history of the English Church, and rejected only such
   doctrines of Romanism as he was unable to find in the Bible and the
   early fathers. In his long and manly defense before the House of Lords
   he claimed to have converted several persons (Chillingworth among them)
   from popery, but frankly admitted that 'the Roman Church never erred in
   fundamentals, for fundamentals are in the Creed, and she denies it not.
   Were she not a true Church, it were hard with the Church of England,
   since from her the English bishops derive their apostolic succession.
   She is, therefore, a true but not an orthodox Church. Salvation may be
   found in her communion; and her religion and ours are one in the great
   essentials. I am not bound to believe each detached phrase in the
   Homilies, and I do not think they assert the pope to be Antichrist; yet
   it can not be proved that I ever denied him to be so. As to the charge
   of unchurching foreign Protestants, I certainly said generally,
   according to St. Jerome, "No bishop, no Church;" and the preface of the
   book of ordination sets forth that the three orders came from the
   apostles.' In his last will and testament he says: 'For my faith, I die
   as I have lived, in the true orthodox profession of the Catholic faith
   of Christ, foreshadowed by the prophets and preached to the world by
   Christ himself, his blessed apostles, and their successors; and a true
   member of his Catholic Church within the communion of a living part
   thereof, the present Church of England, as it stands established by
   law.'

   In one word, Laud was a typical Anglo-Catholic, who unchurched all
   non-episcopal Churches, and regarded the Anglican Church as an
   independent sister of the Latin and Greek communions, and as the
   guardian of the whole truth as against the 'sects,' and of nothing but
   the truth as against Rome. The Anglo-Catholicism of the nineteenth
   century is simply a revival of Laud's system divested of its hateful
   tyranny and political ambition and entanglements. Dr. Pusey, the father
   of modern Anglo-Catholicism, is superior to Archbishop Laud in
   learning, spirituality and charity, but in their theology and logic
   there is no difference. [**placement of this note is uncertain**]
   [1370]

   THE STAR-CHAMBER AND THE HIGH-COMMISSION COURT.

   The two chief instruments of this royal episcopal tyranny were the
   Star-Chamber and the High-Commission Court--two kinds of
   inquisition--the first political, the second ecclesiastical, with an
   unlimited jurisdiction over all sorts of misdemeanors, and with the
   power to inflict the penalties of deprivation, imprisonment, fines,
   whipping, branding, cutting ears, and slitting noses.

   Freedom of speech and the press, which is now among the fundamental and
   inalienable rights of every Anglo-Saxon citizen, was punished as a
   crime against society. Prynne, a graduate of Oxford, and a learned
   barrister of Lincoln's Inn, who published an unreadable book
   (Histrio-Mastix, the Player' Scourge, or Actors' Tragedie, divided into
   Two Parts) against theatres, masquerades, dancing, and women actors,
   with reflections upon the frivolities of the queen, was condemned by
   the Star-Chamber to be expelled from Oxford and Lincoln's Inn, to be
   fined £5000, to stand in the pillory at Westminster and Cheapside, to
   have his ears cut off, his cheeks and forehead branded with hot irons,
   and to be imprisoned for life. His huge quarto volume of 1006 pages,
   with quotations from as many authors, was burned under his nose, so
   that he was nearly suffocated with the smoke. Leighton, a Scotchman
   (father of the saintly archbishop), Bastwick, a learned physician, and
   Henry Burton, a B.D. of Oxford, and rector of a church in London, were
   treated with similar cruelty for abusing in printed pamphlets the
   established hierarchy. No doubt their language was violent and coarse,
   [1371] but torture and mutilation are barbarous and revolting. And yet
   Laud not only thanked the lords of the Star-Chamber for their 'just and
   honorable sentence upon these men,' but regretted, in a letter to
   Strafford, that he could not resort to more 'thorough' measures.

   THE CIVIL WAR AND THE COMMONWEALTH.

   The excesses of despotism, sacerdotalism, ceremonialism, intolerance,
   and cruelty exhausted at last the patience of a noble, freedom-loving
   people, and kindled the blazing war-torch which burned to the ground
   the throne and the temple. The indignant nation rose in its majesty,
   and asserted its inherent and constitutional rights.

   The storm burst forth from the North. The Scots compelled the King to
   abandon his schemes of innovation, and to admit that prelacy was
   contrary to Scripture. In England the memorable Long Parliament
   organized the opposition, and assumed the defense of constitutional
   liberty against royal absolutism. It met Nov. 3, 1640, and continued
   till April 20, 1653, when it was dissolved by Cromwell to give way to
   military despotism. The war between the Parliament and the King broke
   out in August, 1642. For several months the Cavaliers fought more
   bravely and successfully than the undisciplined forces of the
   Roundheads; but the fortunes of war changed when Oliver Cromwell, a
   country gentleman, bred to peaceful pursuits, appeared at the head of
   his Ironsides, whom he selected from the ranks of the Puritans. It was
   an army such as England never saw before or since--an army which feared
   God and hated the pope; which believed in the divine decrees and
   practiced perseverance of saints; which fought for religion; which
   allowed no oath, no drunkenness, no gambling in the camp; which
   sacredly respected private property and the honor of woman; which went
   praying and psalm-singing into the field of battle, and never returned
   from it without the laurels of victory. And when these warriors were
   disbanded at the Restoration, they astonished the royalists by quietly
   taking their place among the most industrious, thrifty, and useful
   citizens. [1372]

   During the reign of the Long Parliament the Star-Chamber and the
   High-Commission Court were ignominiously and forever swept out of
   existence amid the execrations of the people. The episcopal hierarchy
   and the Liturgy were overthrown (Sept. 10, 1642); about two thousand
   royalist ministers, many of them noted for incapacity, idleness, and
   immorality, others highly distinguished for scholarship and piety--as
   Hammond, Sanderson, Pocock, Byron Walton, Hall, Prideaux, Pearson--were
   ejected as royalists from their benefices and given over to poverty and
   misery, though one fifth of the revenues of the sequestered livings was
   reserved for the sufferers. [1373] This summary and cruel act provoked
   retaliation, which in due time came with increased severity. The
   leaders of despotism--the Earl of Strafford (May 12, 1641), Archbishop
   Laud (Jan. 10, 1645), and at last the King himself (Jan. 30,
   1649)--were condemned to death on the block, and thus surrounded by the
   halo of martyrdom. Their blood was the seed of the Restoration. The
   execution of Charles especially was in the eyes of the great majority
   of the English and Scotch people a crime and a blunder, and set in
   motion the reaction in favor of monarchy and episcopacy.

   At first, however, Cromwell's genius and resolution crushed every
   opposition in England, Ireland, and Scotland. On the ruins of the
   monarchy and of Parliament itself he raised a military government which
   inspired respect and fear at home and abroad, and raised England to the
   front rank of Protestant powers, but which created no affection and
   love except among his invincible army. The man of blood and iron, the
   ablest ruler that England ever had, died at the height of his power, on
   the anniversary of his victories at Dunbar and Worcester (Sept. 3), and
   was buried with great pomp among the legitimate kings of England in
   Westminster Abbey (Nov. 23, 1658).' [1374]

   THE RESTORATION.

   The Puritan Commonwealth was but a brilliant military episode, and died
   with its founder. His son Richard, amiable, good-natured, weak and
   incompetent, succeeded him without opposition, but resigned a few
   months after (April 22, 1659). The army, which under its great
   commander had ruled the divided nation, was now divided, while the
   national sentiment in the three kingdoms became united, and demanded
   the restoration of the old dynasty as the safest way to escape the
   dangers of military despotism. Puritanism represented only a minority
   of the English people, and the majority of this minority were
   royalists. The Presbyterians, who were in the saddle during the
   interregnum, were specially active for the unconditional recall of the
   treacherous Stuarts. The event was brought about by the cautious and
   dexterous management of General Monk, a man of expediency, who had
   successively served under Charles I. and Cromwell, and worshiped with
   Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Independents, and at last returned to
   the Episcopal Church. Charles II., 'who never said a foolish thing, and
   never did a wise one,' was received with such general enthusiasm on his
   triumphal march from Dover to London that he wondered where his enemies
   were, or whether he ever had any. The revolution of national sentiment
   was complete. The people seemed as happy as a set of unruly children
   released from the discipline of the school. [1375]

   The restoration of the monarchy was followed by the restoration of
   Episcopacy and the Liturgy with an exclusiveness that did not belong to
   it before. The Savoy Conference between twenty-one Episcopalians and an
   equal number of Presbyterians (April 15 till July 25, 1661) utterly
   failed, and left both parties more exasperated and irreconcilable than
   before. The Churchmen, once more masters of the situation, refused to
   make any concessions and changes. [1376] Thus another opportunity of
   comprehension was lost. In the revision of the Liturgy, which was
   completed by Convocation at the close of the same year (Dec., 1661),
   approved by the King, and ratified by Act of Parliament (April, 1662),
   not the slightest regard was paid to Presbyterian objections,
   reasonable or unreasonable, although about six hundred alterations were
   made; on the contrary, all the ritualistic and sacerdotal features
   complained of were retained and even increased. [1377] The Act of
   Uniformity, which received the royal assent May 19, 1662, and took
   effect on the ominous St. Bartholomew's Day, Aug. 24, 1662
   (involuntarily calling to mind the massacre of the Huguenots), required
   not only from ministers, but also from all schoolmasters, absolute
   conformity to the revised Liturgy and episcopal ordination, or
   reordination. By this cruel act more than two thousand Puritan rectors
   and vicars--that is, about one fifth of the English clergy, including
   such men as Baxter, Howe, Poole, Owen, Goodwin, Bates, Manton,
   Caryl--were ejected and exposed to poverty, public insult, fines, and
   imprisonment for no other crime than obeying God rather than men. A
   proposition in the House of Commons to allow these heroes of conscience
   one fifth of their income, as the Long Parliament had done in the
   removal of royalist clergymen, was lost by a vote of ninety-four to
   eighty-seven. [1378]

   Even the dead were not spared by the spirit of 'mean revenge.' The
   magnates of the Commonwealth, twenty-one in number (including Dr.
   Twisse, the Prolocutor of the Westminster Assembly), who had been
   buried in Westminster Abbey since 1641, were exhumed and reinterred in
   a pit (Sept. 12, 1661). Seven only were exempt; among them Archbishop
   Ussher, who had been buried there at Cromwell's express desire, and at
   a cost of £200 paid by him. Cromwell himself, Ireton, and Bradshaw were
   dug up Jan. 29, 1661, next day dragged to Tyburn, hanged (with their
   faces turned to Whitehall), decapitated, and buried under the gallows.
   Cromwell's head was planted on the top of Westminster Hall. [1379]

   The Puritans were now a target of hatred and ridicule as well as
   persecution. They were assailed from the pulpit, the stage, and the
   press by cavaliers, prelatists, and libertines as a set of hypocritical
   Pharisees and crazy fanatics, noted for their love of Jewish names,
   their lank hair, their sour faces, their deep groans, their long
   prayers and sermons, their bigotry and cant. [1380] And yet the same
   Puritanism, blind, despised, forsaken, or languishing in prison,
   produced some of the noblest works, which can never die. It was not
   dead--it was merely musing and dreaming, and waiting for a resurrection
   in a nobler form. Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (1667) and Bunyan's
   'Pilgrim's Progress' (1678) are the shining lights which illuminate the
   darkness of that disgraceful period. [1381]

   With the Restoration rushed in a flood of frivolity and immorality; the
   King himself setting the example by his shameless adulteries, which he
   blazoned to the world by raising his numerous mistresses and bastards
   to the rank and wealth of the nobility of proud old England. 'The
   violent return to the senses,' says a French writer who has not the
   slightest sympathy with Puritanism, 'drowned morality. Virtue had the
   semblance of Puritanism. Duty and fanaticism became mingled in a common
   reproach. In this great reaction, devotion and honesty, swept away
   together, left to mankind but the wreck and the mire. The more
   excellent parts of human nature disappeared; there remained but the
   animal, without bridle or guide, urged by his desires beyond justice
   and shame.' [1382]

   THE REVOLUTION.

   Bad as was Charles II. (1660-1685), his brother, James II. (1685-1688),
   was worse. He seemed to combine the vices of the Stuarts without their
   redeeming traits. Charles, indifferent to religion and defiant to
   virtue during his life, sent on his death-bed for a Romish priest to
   give him absolution for his debaucheries. James openly professed his
   conversion to Romanism, filled in defiance of law the highest posts in
   the army and the cabinet with Romanists, and opened negotiations with
   Pope Innocent XI. At the same time he persecuted with heartless cruelty
   the Protestant Dissenters, and outraged justice by a series of judicial
   murders which have made the name of Chief Justice Jeffreys as infamous
   as Nero's.

   At last the patience of the English people was again exhausted, the
   incurable race of the Stuarts, unwilling to learn and to forget any
   thing, was forever hurled from the throne, and the Prince of Orange,
   who had married Mary, the eldest daughter of James, was invited to rule
   England as William III.

   THE RESULT.

   The Revolution of 1688 was a political triumph of Puritanism, and
   secured to the nation constitutional liberty and the Protestant
   religion. The Episcopal Church remained the established national
   Church, but the Act of Toleration of 1689 guaranteed liberty and legal
   protection to such Nonconformists as could subscribe thirty-five and a
   half of the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, omitting those to which
   the Puritans had conscientious scruples. Though very limited, this Act
   marked a great progress. It broke up the reign of intolerance, and
   virtually destroyed the principle of uniformity. The Act of Uniformity
   of 1662 was intended for the whole kingdom, and proceeded on the theory
   of an ecclesiastical incorporation of all Englishmen; now it was
   confined to the patronized State Church. It recognized none but the
   Episcopal form of worship, and treated non-Episcopalians as disloyal
   subjects, as culprits and felons; now other Protestant
   Christians--Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, and even
   Quakers--were placed under the protection of the law, and permitted to
   build chapels and to maintain pastors at their own expense. The fact
   was recognized that a man may be a good citizen and a Christian without
   conforming to the State religion. Uniformity had proved an intolerable
   tyranny, and had failed. Comprehension of different denominations under
   one national Church, though favored by William, seemed impracticable.
   Limited toleration opened the way for full liberty and equality of
   Christian denominations before the law; and from the soil of liberty
   there will spring up a truer and deeper union than can be secured by
   any compulsion in the domain of conscience, which belongs to God alone.

   Puritanism did not struggle in vain. Though it failed as a national
   movement, owing to its one-sidedness and want of catholicity, it
   accomplished much. It produced statesmen like Hampden, soldiers like
   Cromwell, poets like Milton, preachers like Howe, theologians like
   Owen, dreamers like Bunyan, hymnists like Watts, commentators like
   Henry, and saints like Baxter, who though dead yet speak. It lives on
   as a powerful moral element in the English nation, in the English
   Church, in English society, in English literature. It has won the
   esteem of the descendants of its enemies. In our day the Duke of
   Bedford erected a statue to Bunyan (1874) in the place where he had
   suffered in prison for twelve years; and Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
   and Independents united in a similar tribute of justice and gratitude
   to the memory of Baxter at Kidderminster (1875), where he is again
   pointing his uplifted arm to the saints' everlasting rest. The
   liberal-minded and large-hearted dean of Westminster represented the
   nobler part of the English people when he canonized those great and
   good men in his memorial discourses at the unveiling of their statues.
   Puritanism lives moreover in New England, which was born of the
   persecutions and trials of its fathers and founders in old England, and
   gave birth to a republic truer, mightier, and more enduring than the
   ephemeral military commonwealth of Cromwell. It will continue to
   preserve and spread all over the Saxon world the love of purity,
   simplicity, spirituality, practical energy, liberty, and progress in
   the Christian Church.

   On the other hand, it is for the children of the Puritans to honor the
   shining lights of the Church of England who stood by her in the days of
   her trial and persecution. That man is to be pitied indeed who would
   allow the theological passions of an intolerant age to blind his mind
   to the learning, the genius, and the piety of Ussher, Andrewes, Hall,
   Pearson, Prideaux, Jeremy Taylor, Barrow, and Leighton, whom God has
   enriched with his gifts for the benefit of all denominations. It is
   good for the Church of England--it is good for the whole Christian
   world--that she survived the fierce conflict of the seventeenth century
   and the indifferentism of the eighteenth to take care of venerable
   cathedrals, deaneries, cloisters, universities, and libraries, to
   cultivate the study of the fathers and schoolmen, to maintain the
   importance of historical continuity and connection with Christian
   antiquity, to satisfy the taste for stability, dignity, and propriety
   in the house of God, and to administer to the spiritual wants of the
   aristocracy and peasantry, and all those who can worship God most
   acceptably in the solemn prayers of her liturgy, which, with all its
   defects, must be pronounced the best ever used in divine service.

   While the fierce conflict about religion was raging, there were
   prophetic men of moderation and comprehension on both sides--

   'Whose dying pens did write of Christian union,

   How Church with Church might safely keep communion;

   Who finding discords daily to increase,

   Because they could not live, would die, in peace.'

   In a sermon before the House of Commons, under the arched roof of
   Westminster Abbey, Richard Baxter uttered this sentence: 'Men that
   differ about bishops, ceremonies, and forms of prayer, may be all true
   Christians, and dear to one another and to Christ, if they be
   practically agreed in the life of godliness, and join in a holy,
   heavenly conversation. But if you agree in all your opinions and
   formalities, and yet were never sanctified by the truth, you do but
   agree to delude your souls, and neither of you will be saved for all
   your agreement.' [1383]

   This is a noble Christian sentiment, echoing the words of a greater man
   than Baxter: 'In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
   nor uncircumcision,'--we may add, neither surplice nor gown, neither
   kneeling nor standing, neither episcopacy nor presbytery nor
   independency--' but a new creature.' [1384]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1350] The name Puritans (from pure, as Catharists from katharos), or
   Precisians, occurs first about 1564 or 1566, and was employed to brand
   those who were opposed to the use of priestly vestments, as the cap,
   surplice, and the tippet (but not the gown, which the Puritans and
   Presbyterians retained, as well as the Continental Protestant
   ministers). Shakspere uses the term half a dozen times, and always
   reproachfully (see Clarke's Shaksp. Concordance and Schmidt's Shaksp.
   Lexicon, s.v.). In the good sense, it denotes those who went back to
   the purity and simplicity of apostolic Christianity in faith and
   morals. Neal defines a Puritan to be 'a man of severe morals, a
   Calvinist in doctrine, and a Nonconformist to the ceremonies and
   discipline of the Church, though not totally separated from it'

   [1351] Fuller, Vol. V. pp. 305-309. The petition was dated January 14,
   1603 (old style), but was presented April 4. The real number of signers
   was only 825.

   [1352] Fuller (Vol. V. pp. 378, 379) speaks in very high terms of
   Reynolds, who was so unceremoniously snubbed by Bishop Bancroft. He
   praises his memory, which was 'little less than marvelous,' and 'a
   faithful index,' as his reason was 'a solid judex of what he read,' and
   his humility, which 'set a lustre on all; communicative of what he knew
   to any that desired information herein, like a tree loaded with fruit,
   bowing down its branches to all that desired to ease it of the burden
   thereof, deserving this epitaph,

   'Incertum est utrum doctior an melior.'

   He associates him with Bishop Jewel and Richard Hooker, all born in
   Devonshire, and educated at Corpus Christi College, and says, ' No one
   county in England have three such men (contemporary at large), in what
   college soever they were bred; no college in England bred such three
   men, in what county soever they were born.' John Reynolds was at first
   a zealous papist and turned an eminent protestant; while his brother
   William was as earnest a protestant, and became by their mutual
   disputation an inveterate papist, which gave occasion to the distich:

   'Quod genus hoc pugnæ est? ubi victus gaudet uterque,

   Et simul alteruter se superasse dolet.'

   'What war is this? when conquer'd both are glad,

   And either to have conquer'd other sad.'

   [1353] He also said to Dr. Reynolds: 'If you aim at a Scotch
   presbytery, it agreeth as well with monarchy as God and the devil. Then
   Jack, and Tom, and Will, and Dick shall meet and censure me and my
   council. Therefore I reiterate my former speech, Le roy s'avisera.'

   [1354] The accounts of the Hampton Court Conference are mostly derived
   from the partial report of Dr. William Barlow, Dean of Chester, who was
   present. It appeared in 1604, and again in 1638. See Fuller, Vol. V.
   pp. 266-303; Cardwell, Hist. of Conferences, p. 121; Procter, Hist. of
   the Book of Common Prayer, p. 88; Marsden, Early Puritans, p. 255.

   [1355] He was assigned to the company which was charged with the
   translation of the writings of the greater and lesser Prophets. But he
   died in 1607, before the completion of the work.

   [1356] The discussion bearing upon this subject is likewise
   characteristic of the King, the Bishop, and the Puritan, and may be
   added here (from Fuller, Vol. V. pp. 284, 285):

   'Dr. Reynolds. "May your Majesty be pleased that the Bible be new
   translated, such as are extant not answering the original." And he
   instanced in three particulars:
                  In the Original             Ill Translated
   'Gal. iv. 25   sustoichei                  Bordereth.
   Psalm cv. 28.  They were not disobedient.  They were not obedient.
   Psalm cvi. 30. Phinehas executed judgment. Phinehas prayed.

   'Bishop of London. "If every man's humor might be followed, there would
   be no end of translating."

   'His Majesty. "I profess I could never yet see a Bible well translated
   in English; but I think that of all, that of Geneva is the worst. I
   wish some special pains were taken for an uniform translation; which
   should be done by the best learned in both universities, then reviewed
   by the bishops, presented to the privy council, lastly ratified by
   royal authority to be read in the whole Church, and no other."

   'Bishop of London. "But it is fit that no marginal notes should be
   added thereunto."

   'His Majesty. "That caveat is well put in; for in the Geneva
   translation some notes are partial, untrue, seditious, and savoring of
   traitorous conceits: as when, from Exodus i. 19, disobedience to kings
   is allowed in a marginal note; and, 2 Chron. xv. 16, King Asa taxed in
   the note for only deposing his mother for idolatry, and not killing
   her. To conclude this point, let errors in matters of faith be amended,
   and indifferent things be interpreted, and a gloss added unto them;
   for, as Bartolus de Regno saith, 'Better a king with some weakness than
   still a change;' so rather a Church with some faults than an
   innovation. And surely, if these were the greatest matters that grieved
   you, I need not have been troubled with such importunate complaints."'

   [1357] Macaulay, chap. i. p. 65 (Boston ed.). I add the admirable
   description of Charles by Mrs. Lucy Hutchinson, in the Memoirs of her
   husband (Bohn's ed. p. 84): 'King Charles was temperate, chaste, and
   serious; so that the fools and bawds, mimics and catamites, of the
   former court, grew out of fashion; and the nobility and courtiers, who
   did not quite abandon their debaucheries, yet so reverenced the king as
   to retire into corners to practice them. Men of learning and ingenuity
   in all arts were in esteem, and received encouragement from the king,
   who was a most excellent judge and a great lover of paintings,
   carvings, gravings, and many other ingenuities, less offensive than the
   bawdry and profane abusive wit which was the only exercise of the other
   court. But, as in the primitive times, it is observed that the best
   emperors were some of them stirred up by Satan to be the bitterest
   persecutors of the Church, so this king was a worse encroacher upon the
   civil and spiritual liberties of his people by far than his father. He
   married a Papist, a French lady, of a haughty spirit, and a great wit
   and beauty, to whom he became a most uxorious husband. By this means
   the court was replenished with Papists, and many who hoped to advance
   themselves by the change turned to that religion. All the Papists in
   the kingdom were favored, and, by the king's example, matched into the
   best families; the Puritans were more than ever discountenanced and
   persecuted, insomuch that many of them chose to abandon their native
   country, and leave their dearest relations, to retire into any foreign
   soil or plantation where they might, amidst all outward inconveniences,
   enjoy the free exercise of God's worship. Such as could not flee were
   tormented in the bishops' courts, fined, whipped, pilloried,
   imprisoned, and suffered to enjoy no rest, so that death was better
   than life to them; and notwithstanding their patient sufferance of all
   these things, yet was not the king satisfied till the whole land was
   reduced to perfect slavery. The example of the French king was
   propounded to him, and he thought himself no monarch so long as his
   will was confined to the bounds of any law; but knowing that the people
   of England were not pliable to an arbitrary rule, he plotted to subdue
   them to his yoke by a foreign force, and till he could effect it, made
   no conscience of granting any thing to the people, which he resolved
   should not oblige him longer than it served his turn; for he was a
   prince that had nothing of faith or truth, justice or generosity, in
   him. He was the most obstinate person in his self-will that ever was,
   and so bent upon being an absolute, uncontrollable sovereign that he
   was resolved either to be such a king or none. His firm adherence to
   prelacy was not for conscience of one religion more than another, for
   it was his principle that an honest man might be saved in any
   profession; but he had a mistaken principle that kingly government in
   the State could not stand without episcopal government in the Church;
   and, therefore, as the bishops flattered him with preaching up his
   sovereign prerogative, and inveighing against the Puritans as factious
   and disloyal, so he protected them in their pomp and pride, and
   insolent practices against all the godly and sober people of the land.'

   [1358] Born at Reading, Oct. 7, 1573; ordained 1601; Bishop of St.
   David's, 1621; of Bath and Wells, 1626; of London, 1628; Chancellor of
   Oxford University, 1630; Archbishop of Canterbury, 1633; impeached of
   high-treason, 1641; beheaded Jan. 10, 1645.

   [1359] 'Because,' as King James said, in keen discernment of his
   character, 'he hath a restless spirit, and can not see when matters are
   well, but loves to toss and change, and to bring things to a pitch of
   reformation, floating in his own brain, which may endanger the
   steadfastness of that which is in a good pass.' He restrained his early
   plans 'to make that stubborn [Scotch] Kirk stoop to the English
   pattern,' for 'he knows not the stomach of that people.'

   [1360] He was called 'the little Archbishop.'

   [1361] 'His influence extended every where, over every body, and every
   thing, small as well as great--like the trunk of an elephant, as well
   suited to pick up a pin as to tear down a tree.'--Stoughton, Vol. I. p.
   33.

   [1362] I must add, however, that in his book against Fisher the Jesuit
   there are a few favorable allusions to Calvin as a theologian,
   especially to his doctrine of the spiritual real presence.

   [1363] Works (Oxf. 1847), Vol. I. pp. 161, 167, 180, 181.

   [1364] That Laud is the author of this Declaration was charged by
   Prynne, and is proved by the Oxford editor of his Works, Vol. I. pp.
   153 sq. Comp. above, p. 617.

   [1365] He informed the king of 'a very ill accident which happened at
   Taplow, by reason of not having the communion-table, railed in, that it
   might be kept from profanations. For in the sermon time a dog came to
   the table and took the loaf of bread prepared for the Holy Sacrament in
   his mouth, and ran away with it. Some of the parishioners took the same
   from the dog and set it again on the table. After sermon the minister
   could not think fit to consecrate this bread, and other fit for the
   Sacrament was not to be had in that town, so there was no
   Communion.'--Works, Vol. V. p 367. This brings to mind the grave and
   curious disputes of the mediæval schoolmen on the question what effect
   the consecrated wafer would have upon a mouse or a rat.

   [1366] Diary, March 8, 1626 (Works, Vol. III. p. 201).

   [1367] He relates, in his Diary, Aug. 4, 1633 (on the day of Archbishop
   Abbot's death), that 'there came one to me, seriously, . . . and
   offered me to be a Cardinal. I went presently to the King and
   acquainted him both with the thing and the person.' On the 17th of
   August, having in the mean time (Aug. 6) been appointed Archbishop of
   Canterbury, he had a second offer of a red hat, and again answered
   'that something dwelt within him which would not suffer that till Rome
   were other than it is' (Works, Vol. III. p. 219). In his Marginal Notes
   on Prynne's Breviate (p. 266), he adds that his 'conscience' also went
   against this. But it is by no means certain or even probable that the
   pope himself (as Fuller states without proof) authorized such an offer.
   It may have been a trap laid for Laud on the eve of his elevation to
   the primacy. Lingard, the Roman Catholic historian of England, says
   that Laud was 'in bad repute in Rome' (Vol. X. p. 139), and Dean Hook,
   his Anglo-Catholic biographer, asserts that he was 'dreaded and hated
   at Rome,' and that his death was greeted there with joy (Life of L. p.
   233). Lingard adds, however, that 'in the solitude of his cell, and
   with the prospect of the block before his eyes, Laud began to think
   more favorably of the Catholic [Roman] Church,' and he shows that
   Rosetti inquired of Cardinal Barberini whether, if Laud should escape
   from the Tower, the pope would afford him an asylum in Rome with a
   pension of 1000 crowns. But this is inconsistent with Laud's last
   defense. He was then over seventy, and anxious to die.

   [1368] Hist. of the Puritans, Vol. I. p. 280.

   [1369] The Conference with Fisher (whose real name was Piersey or
   Percy) took place, by command and in the presence of King James, May
   24, 1622, and was edited, with final corrections and additions, by Laud
   himself in 1639. It was republished 1673 and 1686, and by the Oxford
   University Press 1839, with an Introduction by Edward Cardwell. It is
   also included in Vol. II. of the Oxf. ed. of his Works. Laud thought
   that his way of defense was the only one by which the Church of England
   could justify her separation from the Church of Rome. He bequeathed
   £100 for a Latin translation of this book.

   [1370] The Works of Laud embrace five volumes in the Oxford 'Library of
   Anglo-Catholic Theology.' His seven sermons preached on great state
   occasions abound with his high notions of royalty, episcopacy, and
   uniformity, but do not rise above mediocrity. His Diary--the chief
   source of his autobiography--though not 'contemptible' (as Hallam
   characterizes it), is dry and pedantic, and notices trifling incidents
   as important occurrences, e.g., the bad state of the weather, his
   numerous dreams, the marriage of K. C. with a minister's widow, the
   particular posture of the Elector of the Palatinate at communion 'upon
   a stool by the wall before the traverse, and with another and a cushion
   before him to kneel at' (Dec. 25, 1635), and his unfortunate affairs
   with 'E. B.' (of which he deeply repented; see his Devot. Vol. III. p.
   81). His Devotions are made up mostly of passages of the Psalms and the
   fathers, and reveal the best side of his private character. His last
   prayer, as he kneeled by the block to receive the fatal stroke, is the
   crown of his prayers, and worth quoting: 'Lord, I am coming as fast as
   I can. I know I must pass through the shadow of death before I can come
   to see Thee. But it is but umbra mortis, a mere shadow of death, a
   little darkness upon nature; but Thou, by Thy merits and passion, hast
   broken through the jaws of death. So, Lord, receive my soul, and have
   mercy upon me; and bless this kingdom with peace and plenty, and with
   brotherly love and charity, that there may not be this effusion of
   Christian blood amongst them, for Jesus Christ His sake, if it be Thy
   will.' The opinions on Laud are mostly tinctured by party spirit. His
   friend Clarendon says, 'His learning, piety, and virtue have been
   attained by very few, and the greatest of his infirmities are common to
   all, even the best of men.' Prynne, who lost his two ears by Laud's
   influence, calls him the most execrable traitor and apostate that the
   English soil ever bred ('Canterbury's Doome'). His biographers, Peter
   Heylin (Cyprianus Anglicanus, Lond. 1671), John Parker Lawson (The Life
   and Times of William Laud, Lond. 1829, 2 vols.), and Dr. Hook (in the
   Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, Vol. XI. Lond. 1875), are
   vindicators of his character and policy. May, Hallam, Macaulay,
   Lingard, Green, Häusser, and Stoughton (Vol. I. pp. 402 sq.) condemn
   his public acts, but give him credit for his private virtues. May
   (History of Parliament, approvingly quoted by Hallam, chap. viii.
   Charles I.) says: 'Laud was of an active, or, rather, of a restless
   mind; more ambitious to undertake than politic to carry on; of a
   disposition too fierce and cruel for his coat. He had few vulgar and
   private vices, as being neither taxed of covetousness, intemperance,
   nor incontinence; and, in a word, a man not altogether so bad in his
   personal character as unfit for the state of England.'

   [1371] Burton called the bishops step-fathers, cater-pillars, limbs of
   the beast, blind watchmen, dumb dogs, new Babel-builders, antichristian
   mushrumps, etc. Prynne called them 'silk and satin divines,' and said
   that 'Christ himself was a Puritan, and that, therefore, all men should
   become Puritans.' But their opponents could be equally abusive. Lord
   Cottington, one of Prynne's judges, said that, in writing the
   Histrio-Mastix, 'either the devil had assisted Prynne or Prynne the
   devil.' Another judge, the Earl of Dorset, called him 'omnium malorum
   nequissimum. '

   [1372] One of the noblest specimens of a Puritan officer was Col.
   Hutchinson, whose character and life have been so admirably described
   by his widow (pp. 24 sqq. Bohn's ed.).

   [1373] Comp. Marsden, The Later Puritans, pp. 40 sqq. Baxter himself
   allows that 'some able, godly preachers were cast out for the war
   alone.' Among these was also the excellent Thomas Fuller, the author of
   the incomparable books on Church History and the Worthies of England,
   although in the days of Laud he had been stigmatized as a Puritan in
   doctrine.

   [1374] On his last days and utterances, see the Mercurius Politicus for
   Sept. 2-9,1658, and Stoughton, The Church of the Commonwealth, p. 511.
   Macaulay pays the following tribute to Cromwell's foreign policy: 'The
   Protector's foreign policy at the same time extorted the ungracious
   approbation of those who most detested him. The Cavaliers could
   scarcely refrain from wishing that one who had done so much to raise
   the fame of the nation had been a legitimate king; and the Republicans
   were forced to own that the tyrant suffered none but himself to wrong
   his country, and that, if he had robbed her of liberty, he had at least
   given her glory in exchange. After half a century, during which England
   had been of scarcely more weight in European politics than Venice or
   Saxony, she at once became the most formidable power in the world,
   dictated terms of peace to the United Provinces, avenged the common
   injuries of Christendom on the pirates of Barbary, vanquished the
   Spaniards by land and sea, seized one of the finest West India islands,
   and acquired on the Flemish coast a fortress which consoled the
   national pride for the loss of Calais. She was supreme on the ocean.
   She was the head of the Protestant interest. All the Reformed Churches
   scattered over Roman Catholic kingdoms acknowledged Cromwell as their
   guardian. The Huguenots of Languedoc. the shepherds who, in the hamlets
   of the Alps, professed a Protestantism older than that of Augsburg,
   were secured from oppression by the mere terror of that great name. The
   pope himself was forced to preach humanity and moderation to popish
   princes. For a voice which seldom threatened in vain had declared that,
   unless favor were shown to the people of God, the English guns should
   be heard in the Castle of Saint Angelo. In truth, there was nothing
   which Cromwell had, for his own sake and that of his family, so much
   reason to desire as a general religious war in Europe. In such a war he
   must have been the captain of the Protestant armies. The heart of
   England would have been with him. His victories would have been hailed
   with a unanimous enthusiasm unknown in the country since the rout of
   the Armada, and would have effaced the stain which one act, condemned
   by the general voice of the nation, has left on his splendid fame.
   Unhappily for him. he had no opportunity of displaying his admirable
   military talents except against the inhabitants of the British
   Isles.'--History of England, ch. i. Carlyle says that Cromwell was the
   best thing that England ever did.

   [1375] 'Almost all the gentry of all parts went--some to fetch him
   over, some to meet him at the sea-side, some to fetch him into London,
   into which he entered on the 29th day of May, with a universal joy and
   triumph, even to his own amazement; who, when he saw all the nobility
   and gentry of the land flowing in to him, asked where were his enemies.
   For he saw nothing but prostrates, expressing all the love that could
   make a prince happy. Indeed, it was a wonder in that day to see the
   mutability of some, and the hypocrisy of others, and the servile
   flattery of all. Monk, like his better genius, conducted him and was
   adored like one that had brought all the glory and felicity of mankind
   home with this prince.'--Memoirs of the Life of Col. Hutchinson, p.
   402.

   [1376] The fullest account of the conference held in the Savoy
   Hospital, London, is given by Baxter, who was a member, in his
   Autobiography. Comp. Neal, Cardwell, Stoughton (Restor. Vol. I. p.
   157), Hallam (Ch. XI. Charles II.), and Procter (History of the Book of
   Common Prayer, p. 113). Hallam casts the chief blame on the Churchmen,
   who had it in their power to heal the division and to retain or to
   expel a vast number of worthy clergymen. But both parties lacked the
   right temper, and smarted under the fresh recollection of past
   grievances. Baxter embodied the changes desired by the Puritans in his
   Liturgy, the hasty work of a fortnight, which was never used, but
   republished by Prof. Shields of Princeton, Philadelphia, 1867.

   [1377] Procter (p. 141): 'Some changes were made, in order to avoid the
   appearance of favoring the Presbyterian form of Church government;
   thus, church, or people, was substituted for congregation, and
   ministers in for of the congregation; priests and deacons were
   especially named instead of pastors and ministers.' The Apocryphal
   lessons were retained, and the legend of Bel and the Dragon (omitted in
   1604) was again introduced in the Calendar of Daily Lessons, to show
   contempt for the Puritan scruples. In the Litany the words 'rebellion'
   and 'schism' were added to the petition against 'sedition.'

   [1378] Dr. Stoughton, a well-informed and impartial historian, gives it
   as the result of his careful inquiry that the persecution and
   sufferings of the Episcopalians under the Long Parliament and the
   Commonwealth are not to be compared with the persecution of the
   Nonconformists under Charles I. and Charles II. (Ch. of the
   Commonwealth, p. 346). Hallam is of the same opinion. Richard Baxter,
   one of the ejected ministers, gives a sad account of their sufferings:
   'Many hundreds of these, with their wives and children, had neither
   house nor bread. . . . Their congregations had enough to do, besides a
   small maintenance, to help them out of prisons, or to maintain them
   there. Though they were as frugal as possible, they could hardly live;
   some lived on little more than brown bread and water; many had but
   eight or ten pounds a year to maintain a family, so that a piece of
   flesh has not come to one of their tables in six weeks' time; their
   allowance could scarce afford them bread and cheese. One went to plow
   six days and preached on the Lord's day. Another was forced to cut
   tobacco for a livelihood. . . . Many of the ministers, being afraid to
   lay down their ministry after they had been ordained to it, preached to
   such as would hear them in fields and private houses, till they were
   apprehended and cast into gaols, where many of them perished' (quoted
   by Green, p. 612). Baxter himself was repeatedly imprisoned, although
   he was a royalist and openly opposed Cromwell's rule. For many details
   of suffering, see Orme's Life of Baxter (Lond. 1830), pp. 229 sqq.

   [1379] Stanley's Hist. Memorials of Westminster Abbey, pp. 191 sq.,
   247, 320 (3d ed. Lond. 1869).

   [1380] Butler's Hudibras fairly reflects the prevailing sentiment of
   the Restoration period about the Puritans. He caricatures them in his
   mock-heroic style (Part I. Canto I. vers. 192 sqq.) as

   'That stubborn crew

   Of errant saints, whom all men grant

   To be the true Church militant:

   Such as do build their faith upon

   The holy text of pike and gun;

   Decide all controversy by

   Infallible artillery;

   And prove their doctrine orthodox

   by apostolic blows and knocks;

   Call fire, and sword, and desolation

   A godly thorough Reformation,

   Which always must be carried on,

   And still be doing, never done,

   As if religion were intended

   For nothing else but to be mended.'

   [1381] 'Puritanism,' says an Oxford historian, 'ceased from the long
   attempt to build up a kingdom of God by force and violence, and fell
   back on its truer work of building up a kingdom of righteousness in the
   hearts and consciences of men. It was from the moment of its seeming
   fall that its real victory began. As soon as the wild orgy of the
   Restoration was over, men began to see that nothing that was really
   worthy in the work of Puritanism had been undone. The revels of
   Whitehall, the skepticism and debauchery of courtiers, the corruption
   of statesmen, left the mass of Englishmen what Puritanism had made
   them--serious, earnest, sober in life and conduct, firm in their love
   of Protestantism and of freedom. In the Revolution of 1688 Puritanism
   did the work of civil liberty, which it had failed to do in that of
   1642. It wrought out through Wesley and the revival of the eighteenth
   century the work of religious reform which its earlier efforts had only
   thrown back for a hundred years. Slowly, but steadily, it introduced
   its own seriousness and purity into English society, English
   literature, English politics. The whole history of English progress,
   since the Restoration, on its moral and spiritual sides, has been the
   history of Puritanism.'--J. R. Green's Short History of the English
   People, p. 586.

   IMPORTANCE OF THE ASSEMBLY.

   It was after such antecedents, and in such surroundings, that the
   Westminster Assembly of Divines was called to legislate for Christian
   doctrine, worship, and discipline in three kingdoms. It forms the most
   important chapter in the ecclesiastical history of England during the
   seventeenth century. Whether we look at the extent or ability of its
   labors, or its influence upon future generations, it stands first among
   Protestant Councils. The Synod of Dort was indeed fully equal to it in
   learning and moral weight, and was more general in its composition,
   since it embraced delegates from nearly all Reformed Churches; while
   the Westminster Assembly was purely English and Scotch, and its
   standards even to-day are little known on the Continent of Europe.
   [1385] But the doctrinal legislation of the Synod of Dort was confined
   to the five points at issue between Calvinism and Arminianism; the
   Assembly of Westminster embraced the whole field of theology, from the
   eternal decrees of God to the final judgment. The Canons of Dort have
   lost their hold upon the mother country; the Confession and Shorter
   Catechism of Westminster are as much used now in Anglo-Presbyterian
   Churches as ever, and have more vitality and influence than any other
   Calvinistic Confession.

   It is not surprising that an intense partisan like Clarendon should
   disparage this Assembly. [1386] Milton's censure is neutralized by his
   praise, for, although he hated presbytery only less than episcopacy, he
   called the Assembly a 'select assembly,' 'a learned and memorable
   synod,' in which 'piety, learning, and prudence were housed.' This was
   two years after the Assembly had met, when its character was fully
   shown. He afterwards changed his mind, chiefly for a personal
   reason--in consequence of the deservedly bad reception of his
   unfortunate book on 'Divorce,' which he had dedicated in complimentary
   terms to this very Assembly and to the Long Parliament. [1387]

   Richard Baxter, who was not a member of the Assembly, but knew it well,
   and was a better judge of its theological and religious character than
   either Clarendon or Milton, pays it this just tribute: 'The divines
   there congregated were men of eminent learning, godliness, ministerial
   abilities, and fidelity; and being not worthy to be one of them myself,
   I may the more freely speak the truth, even in the face of malice and
   envy, that, as far as I am able to judge by the information of all
   history of that kind, and by any other evidences left us, the Christian
   world, since the days of the apostles, had never a synod of more
   excellent divines (taking one thing with another) than this and the
   Synod of Dort.' He adds, however, 'Yet, highly as I honor the men, I am
   not of their mind in every part of the government which they have set
   up. Some words in their Catechism I wish had been more clear; and,
   above all, I wish that the Parliament, and their more skillful hand,
   had done more than was done to heal our breaches, and had hit upon the
   right way, either to unite with the Episcopalians and Independents, or,
   at least, had pitched on the terms that are fit for universal concord,
   and left all to come in upon those terms that would.' [1388]

   Hallam censures the Assembly for its intolerant principles, but admits
   that it was 'perhaps equal in learning, good sense, and other merits to
   any Lower House of Convocation that ever made a figure in England.' One
   of the best-informed German historians says of the Assembly: 'A more
   zealous, intelligent, and learned body of divines seldom ever met in
   Christendom.' [1389]

   The chief fault of the Assembly was that it clung to the idea of a
   national State Church, with a uniform system of doctrine, worship, and
   discipline, to which every man, woman, and child in three kingdoms
   should conform. But this was the error of the age; and it was only
   after a series of failures and persecutions that the idea of religious
   freedom took root in English soil.

   APPOINTMENT OF THE ASSEMBLY.

   Soon after the opening of the Long Parliament the convening of a
   conference of divines for the settlement of the theological and
   ecclesiastical part of the great conflict suggested itself to the minds
   of leading men. The first bill of Parliament to that effect was
   conceived in a spirit hostile to the Episcopal hierarchy, but rather
   friendly to the ancient liturgy, and was passed Oct. 15, 1642, but
   failed for the want of royal assent.

   As the king's concurrence became hopeless, Parliament issued on its own
   responsibility an ordinance, June 12, 1643, commanding that an assembly
   of divines should be convened at Westminster, in London, on the first
   day of July following, to effect a more perfect reformation of the
   Church of England in its liturgy, discipline, and government on the
   basis of the Word of God, and thus to bring it into nearer agreement
   with the Church of Scotland and the Reformed Churches on the Continent.
   Presbyterianism was not mentioned, but pretty plainly pointed at. The
   Assembly was to consist of one hundred and fifty-one members in all,
   viz., thirty lay assessors (ten Lords and twenty Commoners), who were
   named first, [1390] and included such eminent scholars, lawyers, and
   statesmen as John Selden, John Pym, Boulstrode Whitelocke, Oliver St.
   John, Sir Benjamin Rudyard, and Sir Henry Vane, and of one hundred and
   twenty-one divines, who were selected from the different counties,
   chiefly from among the Presbyterians, with a few of the most
   influential Episcopalians and Independents. Forty members constituted a
   quorum.

   The Assembly was thus created by State authority. In like manner, the
   ancient oecumenical councils were called by emperors, and the Synod of
   Dort by the government of the United Provinces. The English
   Convocations also can not meet, nor make canons, nor discuss topics
   without royal license. The twenty-first of the Thirty-nine Articles
   forbids the calling of General Councils except 'by the command and will
   of princes.' Parliament now exercised the privilege of the crown, and
   usurped the ecclesiastical supremacy. It nominated all the members,
   with the exception of the Scotch commissioners, who were appointed by
   the General Assembly, and were admitted by Parliament. It fixed the
   time and place of meeting, it prescribed the work, and it paid the
   expenses (allowing to each member four shillings a day); it even chose
   the prolocutor and scribes, filled the vacancies, and reserved to its
   own authority all final decision; reducing thus the Assembly to an
   advisory council. Hence even the Westminster Confession was presented
   to Parliament simply as a 'humble Advice.' But with all its horror of
   ecclesiastical despotism, engendered by the misgovernment of Laud, the
   Long Parliament was the most religious political assembly that ever met
   in or out of England, and was thoroughly controlled by the stern spirit
   of Puritanism. Once constituted, the Assembly was not interfered with,
   and enjoyed the fullest freedom of debate. Its standards were wholly
   the work of competent divines, and received the full and independent
   assent of ecclesiastical bodies.

   The king by proclamation prohibited the meeting of the Assembly, and
   threatened those who disobeyed his order with the loss of all their
   ecclesiastical livings and promotions. This unfortunately prevented the
   attendance of loyal Episcopalians.

   COMPOSITION AND PARTIES.

   It was the intention of Parliament to comprehend within the Assembly
   representatives of all the leading parties of the English Church with
   the exception of that of Archbishop Laud, whose exclusive
   High-Churchism and despotism had been the chief cause of the troubles
   in Church and State, and made co-operation impossible. [1391] The
   selection was upon the whole judicious, though some of the ablest and
   soundest Puritan divines, as Richard Baxter and John Owen, were
   omitted. Scotland came in afterwards, but in time to be of essential
   service and to give the Assembly a strong Presbyterian preponderance.
   The Colonial Churches of New England were invited by a letter from
   members of Parliament (Sept., 1642) to send the Rev. John Cotton,
   Thomas Hooker, and John Davenport as delegates; but they declined,
   because compliance would subject them to all the laws that might be
   made, and might prove prejudicial to them. Hooker, of Hartford, 'liked
   not the business,' and deemed it his duty rather to stay in quiet and
   obscurity with his people in Connecticut than to go three thousand
   miles to plead for Independency with Presbyterians in England.
   Davenport could not obtain leave from his congregation at New Haven.
   Cotton, of Boston, would not go alone. [1392]

   The Assembly itself, by direction of Parliament, addressed fraternal
   letters to the Belgic, French, Helvetic, and other Reformed Churches
   (Nov. 30, 1643), and received favorable replies, especially from
   Holland, Switzerland, and the Huguenot congregation in Paris. [1393]
   Hesse Cassel advised against meddling with the bishops. The king issued
   a counter manifesto from Oxford, May 14, 1644, in Latin and English, to
   all foreign Protestants, and denied the charge of designing to
   introduce popery. [1394]

   As to doctrine, there was no serious difference among the members. They
   all held the Calvinistic system with more or less rigor. There were no
   Arminians, Pelagians, or Antinomians among them.

   But in regard to Church government and discipline the Assembly was by
   no means a unit, although the Scotch Presbyterian polity ultimately
   prevailed, and became for a brief season, by act of Parliament, even
   the established form of government in England. The most frequent and
   earnest debates were on this point rather than on doctrine and worship.
   This conflict prevented the Assembly, says Neal (an Independent), from
   'laying the top stone of the building, so that it fell to pieces before
   it was perfected.' Hereafter the common name of Puritans gave way to
   the party names of Presbyterians and Independents.

   We may arrange the members of the Assembly under four sections: [1395]

   1. The Episcopalians. Parliament elected four prelates, viz.: James
   Ussher (Archbishop of Armagh and Bishop of Carlisle), Brownrigg (Bishop
   of Exeter), Westfield (Bishop of Bristol), Prideaux (Bishop of
   Worcester); [1396] and five doctors of divinity, viz.: Drs. Featley
   (Provost of Chelsea College), Hammond (Canon of Christ's Church,
   Oxford), Holdsworth (Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge), Sanderson
   (afterwards Bishop of Lincoln), and Morley (afterwards Bishop of
   Winchester). An excellent selection. But with one or two exceptions
   they never attended, and could not do so without disloyalty and
   disobedience to the king; besides, they objected to the company with an
   overwhelming number of Puritans, and a council not elected by the
   clergy and mixed with laymen. Ussher is said to have attended once, but
   on no good authority; he was present, however, in spirit, and great
   respect was paid to his theology by the Assembly. [1397] Brownrigg sent
   in an excuse for non-attendance. Westfield was present, at least, at
   the first meeting. Dr. Featley, a learned Calvinist in doctrine, and a
   violent polemic against the Baptists, was the only Episcopalian who
   attended regularly and took a prominent part in the proceedings until,
   after the adoption of the Scotch Covenant, he was expelled by
   Parliament for revealing, contrary to pledge, the secrets of the
   Assembly in a letter to Ussher, then in the king's headquarters at
   Oxford, and was committed to prison (Sept. 30, 1643). This act of
   severity is strongly condemned by Baxter. Here ends the connection of
   Episcopacy with the Assembly.

   Before this time Parliament had been seriously agitated by the
   Episcopal question. As early as Nov. 13, 1640, the 'Root and Branch'
   party sent in a petition signed by 15,000 Londoners for the total
   overthrow of the Episcopal hierarchy, while 700 clerical petitioners
   prayed merely for a reduction and modification of the same. Radicalism
   triumphed at last under the pressure of political necessity and the
   popular indignation created by Laud's heartless tyranny. First the
   bishops were excluded from the House of Lords (Feb. 5, 1642), with the
   reluctant assent of the king; and then the hierarchy itself was decreed
   out of existence (Sept. 10, 1642), the bill to take effect Nov. 5,
   1643, [1398] but the ordinances to carry this measure into full effect
   were not-passed till Oct. 9 and Nov. 16, 1646. [1399] The old building
   was destroyed before a new building was agreed upon. This was the very
   question to be decided by the Assembly; hence the interval between the
   law and its execution. For nearly twenty years the Episcopal Church,
   though not legally abolished, from want of royal assent, was an
   ecclesia pressa el illicita on her own soil.

   Among the scores or hundreds of pamphlets which appeared in this war
   upon the bishops, the five anti-Episcopal treatises of John Milton were
   the most violent and effective. He attacked the English hierarchy,
   especially as it had developed itself under the Stuarts, with a force
   and majesty of prose which is unsurpassed even by his poetry. He went
   so far as to call Lucifer 'the first prelate-angel,' and treats Ussher
   with lofty contempt as a mere antiquarian or dryasdust. 'He rolls,'
   says his biographer, 'and thunders charge after charge; he tasks all
   his genius for epithets and expressions of scorn; he says things of
   bishops, archbishops, the English Liturgy, and some of the dearest
   forms of the English Church, the like of which could hardly be uttered
   now in any assembly of Englishmen without hissing and execration.'
   [1400]

   2. The Presbyterians formed the great majority and gained strength as
   the Assembly advanced. Their Church polity is based upon the two
   principles of ministerial parity, as to ordination and rank (or the
   original identity of presbyters and bishops), and the self-government
   of the Church by representative judicatories composed of clerical and
   lay members. It was essentially the scheme of Calvin as it prevailed in
   the Reformed Churches on the Continent, and was established in
   Scotland.

   The Scots seemed to be predestinated for Calvinistic Presbyterianism by
   an effective decree of Providence. The hostility of their bishops to
   the Reformation, and the repeated attempts of the Stuarts to force
   English institutions upon them, filled the nation with an intense
   aversion to Episcopacy and liturgical worship. Bishop Bancroft, of
   London, the first real High-Church Episcopalian, called English
   Presbyterianism an 'English Scottizing for discipline.'

   In England, on the contrary, Episcopacy and the Prayer-Book were
   identified with the Reformation and Protestant martyrdom, and hence
   were rooted in the affections of the people. Besides, the early bishops
   were in fraternal correspondence with the Swiss Churches. But in the
   latter part of Elizabeth's reign, when Episcopacy took exclusive ground
   and rigorously enforced uniformity against all dissent, Presbyterianism
   began to raise its head under the lead of two eminent Calvinists,
   Thomas Cartwright (1535-1603), Professor of Theology in Cambridge, and
   Walter Travers (d. 1624), Preacher in the Temple, London, afterwards
   Provost of Trinity College, Dublin. The former was in conflict with the
   High-Churchism of Archbishop Whitgift; [1401] the latter with the
   moderate Churchism of Richard Hooker, who was far his superior in
   ability, and whom he himself esteemed as 'a holy man.' The first
   English presbytery within the prelatic Church, as an ecclesiola in
   ecclesia, was formed at Wandsworth, in Surrey, in 1572, and Cartwright
   drew up for it a 'Directory of Church-Government,' or 'Book of
   Discipline,' in 1583, which is said to have been subscribed by as many
   as five hundred clergymen, and which was printed by authority of
   Parliament in 1644. [1402]

   This anomalous organization was stamped out by authority, but the
   recollection of it continued through the reigns of James and Charles,
   and gathered strength with the rising Conflict.

   The Westminster divines, with the exception of the Scotch Commissioners
   and two French Reformed pastors of London, [1403] were in Episcopal
   orders, and graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, and therefore as a body
   not opposed to Episcopacy as such. A goodly number inclined to Ussher's
   scheme of a 'reduced' or limited Episcopacy, i.e., a common government
   of the Church by presbyters under the supervision of the bishop as
   primus inter pares. [1404]

   Had the moderate Episcopalians attended, the result would probably have
   been a compromise between Episcopacy and Presbytery. But the logic of
   events which involved Parliament in open war with the stubborn king,
   and necessitated the calling in of the aid of Presbyterian Scotland,
   changed the aspect of affairs. The subscription of the 'Solemn League
   and Covenant' (Sept., 1643) bound both the Parliament and the Assembly
   to the preservation of the doctrine, worship, and discipline of the
   Church of Scotland and the extirpation of popery and prelacy (i.e., the
   government of the Church by archbishops and bishops).

   There were, however, two classes of Presbyterians, corresponding to the
   Low and High Church Episcopalians. The liberal party maintained that
   the Presbyterian form of government was based on human right, and
   'lawful and agreeable to the Word of God,' but subject to change
   according to the wants of the Church. The high and exclusive
   Presbyterians of the school of Andrew Melville maintained that it was
   based on divine right, and 'expressly instituted or commanded' in the
   New Testament as the only normal and unchangeable form of Church
   polity. Twisse, Gataker, Reynolds, Palmer, and many others advocated
   the jus humanum of Presbytery, all the Scotch Commissioners and the
   five 'Smectymnuans,' [1405] so called from their famous tract
   Smectymnuus, in reply to Bishop Hall's defense of Episcopacy (March,
   1641), advocated the jus divinum. The latter triumphed, but for the
   sake of union they had to forego some details of their theory. [1406]

   The sequel, however, proved that Presbyterianism, so congenial to
   Scottish soil, was an artificial plant in England. Milton's prophetic
   words were fulfilled: 'Woe be to you, Presbyterians especially, if ever
   any of Charles's race recovers the English sceptre! Believe me, you
   shall pay all the reckoning.' Independency has ultimately far outgrown
   Presbytery, and is preferred by the English mind because it comes
   nearer to Episcopacy in making each pastor a bishop in his own
   congregation. Baxter says that Ussher agreed with the Independents in
   this, 'that every bishop was independent, and that synods and councils
   were not so much for government as concord.' [1407] If Presbyterianism
   has recently taken a new start and made great progress in London and
   other cities of England, it is owing mostly to the immigration of
   energetic and liberal Scotchmen and the high character of its leading
   ministers.

   3. The Independents, called 'the five dissenting brethren' by the
   Presbyterians. They were, led by Dr. Thomas Goodwin and Rev. Philip
   Nye. [1408] Though small in number (twelve at the most), they were
   strong in ability, learning, and weight of character, and possessed the
   confidence of the rising Cromwell and the army, as well as the distant
   colonies in New England. Some of them had been driven to Holland by the
   persecution of Laud and Wren, and had administered to congregations of
   their expatriated countrymen, which occupied a middle ground between
   Brownism and Presbytery, after the model of John Robinson's pilgrims in
   Leyden. They were allowed the use of the Reformed churches, with
   liberty to ring the bell for service. After their return they advocated
   congregational independency and toleration, which the Presbyterians
   abhorred. [1409] The Independents maintained that a Christian
   congregation should consist of converted believers, and govern itself
   according to Christ's law, without being subject to the jurisdiction of
   presbyteries and synods, and that such a congregation had even a right
   to ordain its own minister. They fought the Presbyterians at every step
   on the questions of ruling elders, ordination, jurisdiction of
   presbyteries and synods, toleration, and threatened at times to break
   up the harmony of the meeting.

   The longest debate, called 'the Grand Debate,' which lasted thirty
   days, was on the divine right of presbytery. And yet the two parties
   had great respect for each other. 'I wish,' said Gillespie, in the heat
   of the controversy, 'the dissenting brethren prove to be as unwilling
   to divide from us as we have been unwilling to divide from them. I wish
   that, instead of toleration, there may be a mutual endeavor for a happy
   accommodation,' [1410]

   The Independents appealed, rather inconsistently, to Cæsar, and
   addressed 'An Apologetic Narration to Parliament' (Dec., 1643). Under
   the Protectorate of Cromwell they became the ruling party, and had
   great political influence; but after the Restoration they resolved to
   seek for toleration outside of the National Church rather than for
   comprehension within it. New England was their Eldorado. [1411]

   4. The Erastians [1412] maintained the ecclesiastical supremacy of the
   civil government in all matters of discipline, and made the Church a
   department of the State. They held that clergymen were merely teachers,
   not rulers, and that the power of the keys belonged to the secular
   magistrate. They hoped in this way to secure national unity and to
   prevent an imperium in imperio and all priestly tyranny over
   conscience; but in fact they simply substituted a political for an
   ecclesiastical despotism, a cæsaropapacy for a hierarchical papacy.
   They were willing to submit to a jure humano Presbyterianism, but they
   denied that any particular form of Church government was prescribed in
   the New Testament, and claimed for the State the right to establish
   such a form as might be most expedient.

   The advocates of Erastianism in the Assembly were Selden, Lightfoot,
   and Coleman, all distinguished for Hebrew learning, which they used to
   good advantage. They appealed to the example of Moses and the kings of
   Israel, and the institutions of the Synagogue. They were backed by the
   lawyers among the lay-assessors and by the House of Commons, most of
   whom were (according to Baillie) 'downright Erastians.' The Assembly
   itself owed its existence to an act of Erastianism.

   In strong opposition to them the Presbyterians maintained that the Lord
   Jesus, as sole King and Head of his Church, has appointed a spiritual
   government with distinct officers.

   The controversy was ably conducted on both sides, and, we may say,
   exhausted. [1413]

   The Independents and Erastians withdrew before the final adoption of
   the Book of Discipline, and left the field to the Presbyterians. The
   Presbyterian Church polity was at length established by the English
   Parliament, which ordained, June 29, 1647, that 'all parishes within
   England and Wales be brought under the government of congregational,
   classical, provincial, and national churches, according to the form of
   Presbyterial government agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at
   Westminster.' Provinces were to take the place of dioceses, and were
   again divided into classes or presbyteries, and these were to elect
   representatives to a national assembly. But Parliament retained an
   Erastian power in its own hand, and would not permit even exclusion
   from the Lord's table without allowing to the offender recourse to the
   civil courts. Presbyterianism was nominally the established religion,
   but only in two provinces, London and Lancashire, was it fairly
   established, until its overthrow by the Restoration. [1414]

   THE LEADING MEMBERS.

   Among the 121 divines of the Assembly there was a goodly portion of
   worthy and distinguished men who had suffered privation and exile under
   the misgovernment of Laud, who jeopardized their livings by accepting
   the appointment, notwithstanding the threats of the king, and who had
   the courage, after the Restoration, to sacrifice all earthly comforts
   to their conscientious convictions. Not a few of them combined rare
   learning, eloquence, and piety in beautiful harmony. 'The Westminster
   divines,' says Dr. Stoughton, 'had learning--Scriptural, patristic,
   scholastic, and modern--enough and to spare: all solid, substantial,
   and ready for use. Moreover, in the perception and advocacy of what is
   most characteristic and fundamental in the gospel of Jesus Christ they
   were as a body considerably in advance of some who could put in a claim
   to equal and perhaps higher scholarship.' [1415]

   It is sufficient for our purpose to mention the most eminent of the
   Westminster divines. [1416]

   William Twisse, D.D. (Oxon.), Rector of Newbury, Prolocutor or
   Moderator by appointment of Parliament till his death (July, 1646). He
   was of German descent, about sixty-nine years of age, noted as a high
   Calvinist of the supralapsarian school, full of learning and subtle
   speculative genius, but 'merely bookish,' as Baillie says, and poorly
   fitted to guide a delicate assembly. Bishop Hall calls him 'a man so
   eminent in school-divinity that the Jesuits shrunk under his strength.'
   Thomas Fuller says: [1417] 'His plain preaching was good, solid
   disputing better, pious living best of all good.'

   Charles Herle (d. 1659), an Oxford scholar, and Rector of Winwick in
   Lancashire, succeeded Twisse as Prolocutor. He was a moderate
   Presbyterian, and, in the language of Fuller, 'so much Christian,
   scholar, and gentleman that he could unite in affection with those who
   were disjoined in judgment from him.' He wrote against independency,
   but remarked in the Preface: 'The difference between us is not so
   great; at most it does but ruffle a little the fringe, not any way rend
   the garment of Christ.' [1418]

   John White (Oxon., d. 1648) and Dr. Cornelius Burgess (Oxon., d. 1665),
   the two Assessors, enjoyed general esteem. White was surnamed 'the
   patriarch of Dorchester,' but he 'would willingly contribute his shot
   of facetiousness on any just occasion' (Fuller). He was the
   great-grandfather of the Wesleys on the maternal side. Burgess was
   'very active and sharp,' bold and fearless, an eminent debater and
   valiant defender of Presbyterianism and royalty.

   Dr. Arrowsmith, head of St. John's College, Cambridge, 'a man with a
   glass eye,' having lost one by an arrow-shot, a 'learned divine' and
   'elegant Latinist,' and long remembered in Cambridge for his 'sweet and
   admirable temper,' and Dr. Tuckney (d. 1670), Vice-Chancellor of the
   University, an inspiring teacher and bountiful friend of the poor, must
   be mentioned together as the chief composers of the Larger and Shorter
   Catechisms. They were both friends of the broad-minded Whichcote, who
   calls Arrowsmith 'the companion of his special thought.' [1419] Dr.
   Tuckney, when requested by some members of Parliament to pay special
   regard to piety in his elections in Cambridge, made the sensible reply:
   'No man has a greater respect than I have for the truly godly; but I am
   determined to choose none but scholars. They may deceive me in their
   godliness--they can not in their scholarship.' He is said to be the
   author of the exposition of the Ten Commandments in the Larger
   Catechism.

   Edmund Calamy, B.D. (Cantab.), one of the four representatives of the
   London clergy, was a very popular preacher and a leader in the
   Presbyterian party. 'He was the first openly to avow and defend the
   Presbyterian government before a committee of Parliament; and though
   tempted afterwards with a bishopric, he continued stanch to his
   principles to his dying day.' [1420] He died soon after the great fire
   in London (1666). His grandson, of the same name, was still more
   celebrated.

   Joseph Caryl, M.A. (Oxon., 1602-1673), was a moderate Independent, a
   distinguished preacher, and 'a man of great learning, piety, and
   modesty' (Neal). He became afterwards one of Cromwell's Triers, was
   ejected in 1662, and lived privately, preaching to his congregation as
   the times would permit. He is chiefly known as the indefatigable author
   of a commentary on Job, in twelve volumes, 4to (Lond. 1648-1666), which
   is an excellent school of its chief topic, the virtue of patience.
   [1421]

   Thomas Coleman (Oxon.) was called 'Rabbi Coleman' for his profound
   Hebrew learning. Baillie describes him as half-scholar and half-fool,
   and of small estimation. He died during the heat of the Erastian debate
   (1647).

   Thomas Gataker, B.D. (Cantab., d. 1654, aet. eighty), a devourer of
   books, and equally esteemed for learning, piety, and sound doctrine. He
   refused various offers of preferment.

   Thomas Goodwin, D.D. (Cantab., d. 1680, aet. eighty), one of the two
   *patriarchs of English Independency,' Philip Nye being the other. He
   was Vicar of Trinity Church, Cambridge, relinquished his preferments in
   1634, was pastor of a congregation of English exiles at Arnheim,
   Holland, then in London, [1422] and afterwards President of Magdalen
   College, in Oxford, till the Restoration, when he resigned. He was the
   favorite minister of Cromwell, eloquent in the pulpit, orthodox in
   doctrine, and exemplary in life, but 'tinctured with a shade of gloom
   and austerity' (M'Crie). 'Though less celebrated than Owen, his great
   attainments in scholarship and the range and variety of his thoughts
   astonish us when we read his writings, showing how familiar he was with
   all forms of theological speculation, ancient and modern' (Stoughton).
   [1423]

   Dr. Joshua Hoyle (Oxon., d. 1654), Divinity Professor in Dublin,
   afterwards Master of University College, Oxford, was the only Irish
   divine of the Assembly, 'a master of the Greek and Latin fathers,' who
   'reigned both in the chair and in the pulpit.'

   John Lightfoot, D.D. (Cantab.), the greatest rabbinical scholar of his
   age, whose Horæ Hebraicæ et Talmudicæ are still familiarly quoted in
   illustration of the New Testament. His Journal is one of the chief
   sources for the history of the Assembly, especially for exegetical and
   antiquarian aspects of the Erastian controversy. In 1649 he became
   Master of Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and retained his post till he
   died, 1675, aged seventy-three.

   Stephen Marshall, B.D. (Cantab.), Lecturer at St. Margaret's,
   Westminster, was 'the best preacher in England' (Baillie), a fearless
   leader in the political strife, a great favorite in the Assembly,
   'their trumpet, by whom they sounded their solemn fasts' (Fuller). One
   of his royalist enemies called him 'the Geneva bull, a factions and
   rebellions divine.' He was buried in Westminster Abbey, 1655, but
   disinterred with the other Puritans after the Restoration.

   Philip Nye (Oxon., d. 1672), minister of Kimbolton, who had been in
   exile with his friend Goodwin, took a leading part, as a Commissioner
   of Parliament, in soliciting the assistance of the Scots, and securing
   subscription to the Covenant; but he conceived a dislike to their
   Church polity and gave them a world of trouble. He kept them for three
   weeks debating on the superior propriety, as he contended, of having
   the elements handed to the communicants in their own seats instead of
   calling them out to the table. He was a stanch Independent, a keen
   debater, and a 'great politician, of uncommon depth, and seldom if ever
   outreached' (Neal). He was one of the Triers under Cromwell, and the
   leader of the Congregational Savoy Conference. After the Restoration
   lie declined tempting offers, and preached privately to a congregation
   of Dissenters till he died, seventy-six years of age.

   Herbert Palmer, B.D. (Cantab.), Vicar of Ashwell, afterwards Master of
   Queen's College, Cambridge, was a little man with a childlike look, but
   very graceful and accomplished, a fluent orator in French as well as
   English, and a model pastor. He spent his fortune in works of charity,
   and his delicate frame in the cure of souls. He had scruples about the
   divine right of ruling elders, but became a convert to Presbyterianism.
   He is the real author of the 'Christian Paradoxes,' which have so long
   been attributed to Lord Bacon. [1424]

   Dr. Edward Reynolds (Oxon., d. 1676), 'the pride and glory of the
   Presbyterian party' (Wood), was very learned, eloquent, cautious, but
   lacking backbone. He accepted from Charles II. the bishopric of Norwich
   (Jan., 1660), owing, it was said, to the influence of 'a covetous and
   politic consort' (Wood); but 'he carried the wounds of the Church in
   his heart and in his bowels to the grave with him.'

   Sir Francis Rous (or Rowse, b. 1579, d. 1659), 'an old, most honest'
   member of Parliament, afterwards a member of Cromwell's Privy Council,
   was one of the twenty Commoners who were deputed to the Assembly. He
   innocently acquired an immortal fame by his literal versification of
   the Psalms, which was first printed in 1643, then revised, and is used
   to this day in Scotland and in many Presbyterian congregations in
   America in preference to all other versions and hymns. [1425]

   Lazarus Seaman, B.D. (Cantab., 1667), one of the four representatives
   of the London clergy, a very active member and reputed as an
   Orientalist, who always carried with him a small Hebrew Bible without
   points. He is described as 'an invincible disputant' and 'a person of
   most deep, piercing, and eagle-eyed judgment in all points of
   controversial divinity, in which he had few equals, if any superiors.'
   He became Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, but was ejected after the
   Restoration.

   John Selden (1584-1654), one of the lay assessors, and a scholar and
   wit of European reputation. [1426] His scholarship was almost
   universal, but lay chiefly in languages, law, and antiquities (hence
   'antiquariorum coryphæus'). For a long time he took an active part in
   the debates, and often perplexed the divines by raising scruples. He
   liked to correct their 'little English pocket Bibles' from the Greek
   and Hebrew. Not especially fond of the flesh of the Scriptures, he cast
   the 'bones' at them 'to break their teeth therewith' (Fuller). He was
   an Erastian and a clergy-hater, but on his death-bed he declared that
   'out of the numberless volumes he had read, nothing stuck so close to
   his heart, or gave him such solid satisfaction, as the single passage
   of Paul, 'The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto
   all men.'

   Richard Vines, Master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge (d. 1656), 'an
   excellent preacher and very powerful in debate, and much respected on
   all accounts' (Masson).

   Thomas Young, Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, a Scotchman by birth,
   Milton's preceptor, and the chief of the five 'Smectymnuans.'

   THE SCOTCH COMMISSIONERS.

   After the adoption of the international League and Covenant, Scotland
   sent five clerical and three lay commissioners who admirably
   represented their Church and country. They formed a group by themselves
   at the right hand of the Prolocutor. They were the only delegates who
   were elected by proper ecclesiastical authority, viz., the General
   Assembly of their Church (Aug. 19, 1643), at the express request of the
   English Parliament; they declined being considered members in the
   ordinary sense, but they were allowed by warrant of Parliament to be
   present and to debate, and practically they exerted an influence
   disproportionate to their number. They arrived in London in September,
   fresh from the battle 'with lordly bishops, popish ceremonies, and
   royal mandates,' and full of the 'perfervidum ingenium Scotorum.'

   Alexander Henderson, Rector of the University of Edinburgh since 1640,
   sixty years of age, ranks next to John Knox and Andrew Melville in the
   history of Scotch Presbyterianism, and was the author of the 'Solemn
   League and Covenant,' which linked the Scottish and English nations in
   a civil and religious alliance for the Reformed religion and civil
   liberty. Being unmarried, he gave himself entirely to the Assembly from
   Aug., 1643, to Aug., 1646. He has heretofore been too much ignored. 'My
   researches,' says Masson, [1427] 'have more and more convinced me that
   he was, all in all, one of the ablest and best men of his age in
   Britain, and the greatest, the wisest, and most liberal of the Scottish
   Presbyterians. They all had to consult him; in every strait and
   conflict he had to be appealed to, and came in at the last as the man
   of supereminent composure, comprehensiveness, and breadth of brow.
   Although the Scottish Presbyterian rule was that no churchman should
   have authority in State affairs, it had to be practically waived in his
   case; he was a cabinet minister without office.'

   Robert Baillie (b. 1599, d. 1662), Professor of Divinity and Principal
   of the University of Glasgow, did not speak much, but was a regular
   attendant for fully three years, a shrewd observer, and has been called
   the Boswell of the Assembly and 'the pleasantest of letter gossips.'
   His 'Letters and Journals' (not properly edited until 1842) are among
   the most graphic books of contemporary memoir to be found in any
   language. His faculty of narration in his pithy native Scotch is
   nothing short of genius. Whenever we have an account from Baillie of
   any thing he saw or was present at, it is worth all accounts put
   together for accuracy and vividness; so in his accounts of Strafford's
   trial, and so in his account of his first impressions of the
   Westminster Assembly' (Masson).

   George Gillespie, minister of Edinburgh (d. 1648), Was only thirty-one
   years of age when he entered the Assembly, the youngest, and yet one of
   the brightest stars, 'the prince of disputants, who with the fire of
   youth had the wisdom of age.' He first attracted public attention in
   his twenty-fourth year by 'A Dispute against the English-Popish
   Ceremonies obtruded upon the Church of Scotland' (1637), which helped
   the revolt against Laud's innovations. He took a leading part in the
   debates of the Assembly against Erastianism and Independency. According
   to Scotch tradition he once made even Selden reel and say, 'That young
   man, by his single speech, has swept away the labors of ten years of my
   life.' This is probably a patriotic exaggeration. The excessive ardor
   and activity of his mind wore out his frame, and he returned from the
   Assembly to die in his native land.

   Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661), Professor of Divinity and Principal of
   St. Mary's College in St. Andrews, was one of the most fervid and
   popular preachers in Scotland, and highly esteemed for his learning and
   piety. 'The characteristics of his mind were clearness of intellect,
   warmth and earnestness of affection, and loftiness and spirituality of
   devotional feeling.' His book, 'Lex Rex,' is considered one of the best
   expositions of the principles of civil and religious liberty; and his
   glowing letters of comfort from his prison in Aberdeen (which he called
   'Christ's Palace') show him to be 'the true saint and martyr of the
   Covenant.'

   Rev. Robert Douglas never sat. Among the lay commissioners, John Lord
   Maitland (afterwards Earl of Lauderdale) distinguished himself first by
   his zeal for the Scotch Covenanters, and afterwards by his apostasy and
   cruelty against them. Sir Archibald Johnstone, of Warristone, was from
   1637 a leader among the Scotch Covenanters, a great lawyer, and a
   devout Christian, who, as Bishop Burnet, his nephew, narrates, often
   prayed in his family two hours at a time with unexhausted copiousness.
   The Marquis of Argyle also, who afterwards suffered death for his
   loyalty to the Scotch Kirk, sat for some time as an elder in the
   Assembly.

   OPENING OF THE ASSEMBLY.

   The Assembly was opened on Saturday, July 1, 1643, in the grand
   national Abbey of Westminster, in the presence of both Houses of
   Parliament and a large congregation, by a sermon of Dr. Twisse on John
   xiv. 18: 'I will not leave you comfortless; I will come unto you'--a
   text which was deemed 'pertinent to these times of sorrow, anguish, and
   misery, to raise up the drooping spirits of the people of God who lie
   under the pressure of Popish wars and combustions.' [1428]

   After service the members of the Assembly, 'three score and nine'
   [1429] (twenty-nine more than the required quorum), repaired for
   organization to the Chapel of Henry VII., that 'most gorgeous of
   sepulchres,' where the Upper House of Convocation used to meet. The
   mediæval architecture formed a striking contrast to the Puritan
   simplicity of worship and dress. The divines appeared in black coats or
   cloaks, skull-caps, and Geneva bands in imitation of the foreign
   Protestants, [1430] with the exception of a few Royalists and
   Episcopalians, who in their canonical gowns seemed 'the only
   non-Conformists.' [1431] Add to this apparel their solemn looks, the
   peaked beards and mustaches, and the broad double ruff around the neck,
   and we have a spectacle of a synod differing as much from a modern
   Presbyterian Assembly as from an Episcopal Convocation or a Roman
   Catholic Council. [1432]

   Every member had to take the following vow (which was read in the
   Assembly every Monday morning):

   'I do seriously promise and vow, in the presence of almighty God, that
   in this Assembly, whereof I am a member, I will maintain nothing in
   point of doctrine but what I believe to be most agreeable to the Word
   of God; nor in point of discipline, but what may make most for God's
   glory and the peace and good of his Church.'

   THE ASSEMBLY IN THE JERUSALEM CHAMBER.

   For several weeks the meetings were held in the Chapel of Henry VII.
   But when extreme cold weather set in at the close of September, the
   Assembly repaired to the 'Jerusalem Chamber,' in the Deanery of
   Westminster. [1433] 'What place more proper for the building of Sion,'
   asks Fuller, 'than the Chamber of Jerusalem, the fairest of the Dean's
   lodgings, where King Henry IV. died, and where these divines did daily
   meet together?' [1434]

   This large and venerable hall, furnished with a long table and chairs,
   and ornamented with tapestry (pictures of the Circumcision, the
   Adoration of the Magi, and the Passage through the Wilderness), was
   originally the withdrawing-room of the abbot, and has become famous in
   romance and history as the cradle of many memorable schemes and events
   from the Reformation down to the present time.

   There, before the fire of the hearth--then a rare luxury in
   England--King Henry IV., who intended to make a pilgrimage to
   Jerusalem, died of a hideous leprosy (March 20, 1413). When informed of
   the name of the chamber, he exclaimed,

   'Laud be to God! even there my life must end.

   It hath been prophesied to me many years

   I would not die but in Jerusalem;

   Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.

   But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie:

   In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.' [1435]

   There Sir Thomas More was confined (1534), and urged by the abbot to
   acknowledge the king's ecclesiastical supremacy; and there probably he
   wrote his appeal to a general council which never met, but may yet meet
   at some future day.

   There, under the genial warmth of the fire which had attracted the
   dying king, the grave Puritan Assembly prepared its standards of
   doctrine, worship, and discipline, to be disowned by England, but
   honored by Scotland and America.

   There the most distinguished Biblical scholars of the Church of
   England, in fraternal co-operation with scholars of Dissenting
   denominations, both nobly forgetting old feuds and jealousies, are now
   engaged in the truly catholic and peaceful work of revising the common
   version of the Bible for the general benefit of English-speaking
   Christendom. [1436]

   BAILLIE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSEMBLY.

   The Assembly in actual session in this famous locality, and its order
   of business, can not be better described than in the graphic language
   of one of the Scotch Commissioners:

   'The like of that Assembly, 'says Professor Baillie, [1437] 'I did
   never see, and, as we hear say, the like was never in England, nor any
   where is shortly like to be. They did sit in Henry the Seventh's
   Chapel, in the place of the Convocation; but since the weather grew
   cold, they did go to Jerusalem Chamber, a fair room in the Abbey of
   Westminster, about the bounds of the College forehall, but wider. At
   the one end nearest the door and on both sides are stages of seats as
   in the new Assembly-House at Edinburgh, but not so high, for there will
   be room but for five or six score. At the upmost end there is one chair
   set on a frame, a foot from the earth, for the Mr. Prolocutor Dr.
   Twisse. Before it, on the ground, stand two chairs for the two Mr.
   Assessors, Dr. Burgess and Mr. White. Before these two chairs, through
   the length of the room, stands a table, at which sit the two scribes,
   Mr. Byfield and Dr. Roborough. The house is all well hung and has a
   good fire, which are some dainties at London. Foranent [in front of]
   the table, upon the Prolocutor's right hand, there are three or four
   ranks of forms. On the lowest we five do sit. Upon the other, at our
   backs, the members of Parliament deputed to the Assembly. On the forms
   foranent us, on the Prolocutor's left hand, going from the upper end of
   the house to the chimney, and at the other end of the house, and
   backside of the table, till it comes about to our seats, are four or
   five stages of forms, whereupon their divines sit as they please,
   albeit commonly they keep the same place. From the chimney to the door
   there are no seats, but a void for passage. The Lords of Parliament use
   to sit on chairs in that void, about the fire. We meet every day of the
   week but Saturday. We sit commonly from nine to one or two [in the]
   afternoon. The Prolocutor at the beginning and end has a short prayer.
   The man, as the world knows, is very learned in the questions he has
   studied, and very good, beloved by all, and highly esteemed; but merely
   bookish, and not much, as it seems, acquainted with conceived prayer,
   [and] among the unfittest of all the company for any action; so after
   the prayer he sits mute. It was the canny conveyance of those who guide
   most matters for their own interest to plant such a man of purpose in
   the chair. One of the Assessors, our good friend Mr. White, has keeped
   in of the gout since our coming; the other, Dr. Burgess, a very active
   and sharp man, supplies, so far as is decent, the Prolocutor's place.

   'Ordinarily there will be present above threescore of their divines.
   These are divided into three committees, in one whereof every man is a
   member; no man is excluded who pleases to come to any of the three.
   Every committee, as the Parliament gives order in writing to take any
   purpose into consideration, takes a portion, and in their afternoon
   meeting prepares matters for the Assembly, sets down their mind in
   distinct propositions, [and] backs their propositions with texts of
   Scripture. After the prayer, Mr. Byfield, the scribe, reads the
   proposition and Scriptures, whereupon the Assembly debates in a most
   grave and orderly way. No man is called up to speak; but who stands up
   of his own accord, he speaks so long as he will without interruption.
   If two or three stand up at once, then the divines confusedly call on
   his name whom they desire to hear first: on whom the loudest and
   maniest [most] voices call, he speaks. No man speaks to any but to the
   Prolocutor. They harangue long and very learnedly. They study the
   questions well beforehand, and prepare their speeches; but withal the
   men are exceeding prompt and well-spoken. I do marvel at the very
   accurate and extemporal replies that many of them usually do make.
   When, upon every proposition by itself, and on every text of Scripture
   that is brought to confirm it, every man who will has said his whole
   mind, and the replies, and duplies, and triplies are heard, then the
   most part calls "To the question." Byfield, the scribe, rises from the
   table and comes to the Prolocutor's chair, who, from the scribe's book,
   reads the proposition, and says, "As many as are of opinion that the
   question is well stated in the proposition, let them say I;" when I is
   heard, he says, "As many as think otherwise, say No." If the difference
   of I's and No's be clear, as usually it is, then the question is
   ordered by the scribes, and they go on to debate the first Scripture
   alleged for proof of the proposition. If the sound of I and No be near
   equal, then says the Prolocutor, "As many as say I, stand up;" while
   they stand, the scribe and others number them in their mind; when they
   sit down the No's are bidden to stand, and they likewise are numbered.
   This way is clear enough, and saves a great deal of time, which we
   spend in reading our catalogue. When a question is once ordered, there
   is no more debate of that matter; but if a man will vaige,' [1438] he
   is quickly taken up by Mr. Assessor, or many others, confusedly crying,
   "Speak to order, to order." No man contradicts another expressly by
   name, but most discreetly speaks to the Prolocutor, and at most holds
   on the general--The reverend brother, who lately or last spoke, on this
   hand, on that side, above, or below.

   'I thought meet once for all to give you a taste of the outward form of
   their Assembly. They follow the way of their Parliament. Much of their
   way is good, and worthy of our imitation: only their longsomeness is
   woeful at this time, when their Church and Kingdom lies under a most
   lamentable anarchy and confusion. They see the hurt of their length,
   but can not get it helped; for being to establish a new Platform of
   worship and discipline to their nation for all time to come, they think
   they can not be answerable if solidly and at leisure they do not
   examine every point thereof.'

   DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES.

   With theological discussion the Assembly combined devotional exercises,
   and observed with Parliament regular and occasional fasts which are
   characteristic of the Puritan piety of that age. At the joint meeting
   of the Parliament and the Assembly in St. Margaret's Church, for the
   signing of the Covenant (Monday, Sept. 25, 1643), Mr. White 'prayed
   near upon an hour,' Mr. Nye 'made an exhortation of another hour long,'
   Mr. Henderson 'did the like;' then there was the reading of the
   Covenant, a prayer by Dr. Yonge, 'another psalm by Mr. Wilson,' and a
   concluding prayer, when they 'adjourned till Thursday morning, because
   of the fast.' [1439]

   Baillie describes the fast observed May 17, 1644, at the request of
   General Essex before his march into the field, as 'the sweetest day' he
   saw in England, although it lasted eight hours, from nine to five,
   without interruption. 'After Dr. Twisse,' he writes, 'had begun with a
   brief prayer, Mr. Marshall prayed large two hours, most divinely,
   confessing the sins of the members of the Assembly in a wonderfully
   pathetic and prudent way. After, Mr. Arrowsmith preached one hour; then
   a psalm; thereafter, Mr. Vines prayed near two hours, and Mr. Palmer
   preached one hour, and Mr. Seaman prayed near two hours; then a psalm.
   After, Mr. Henderson brought them to a short, sweet conference of the
   heart confessed in the Assembly, and other seen faults [1440] to be
   remedied, and the convenience to preach against sects, especially
   Anabaptists and Antinomians. Dr. Twisse closed with a short prayer and
   blessing. God was so evidently in all this exercise that we expect
   certainly a blessing both in our matter of the Assembly and whole
   kingdom.' [1441]

   We can not read such accounts without amazement at the devotional
   fervor and endurance of the Puritan divines. And yet, if we consider
   the length of their prayers and sermons, their austerity in society,
   dress and manner, their peculiar phraseology and cant, their aversion
   to the fine arts and public amusements, however innocent, we need not
   be surprised at the popular rebound to the opposite extreme under the
   frivolous and licentious Charles II. 'All that was beautiful in Church
   music, architecture, or ornament, and in personal elegance and
   refinement, was rigidly proscribed. Even poetry was at a discount;
   Milton himself, in his lifetime, in more senses than one, "sung
   darkling;" and the literary style, of the day, unlike either that of
   the foregoing or the subsequent age, was harsh, stiff, and void of
   elegance. Even the typography of the period is peculiarly grim and
   unseemly.' [1442]

   It should not be forgotten, however, that there are times when
   aesthetics must give way to more important matters, and that radical
   extremes are unavoidable in critical periods. The Catholic Church
   itself, in the first three centuries, passed through the gloom of the
   catacombs, and, in its ascetic abhorrence of heathen art and beauty,
   strangely misconceived even our blessed Lord's personal appearance as
   homely and repulsive in the days of his humiliation. Tertullian, in his
   way, went farther than the Puritans.

   DURATION AND CLOSE.

   The Assembly occupied about five years and six months for the
   completion of its proper work--the standards of doctrine, worship, and
   discipline--and held no less than 1163 regular sessions from July 1,
   1643, till February 22, 1649, when it ought to have adjourned sine die.
   It met every day, except Saturday and Sunday, from nine o'clock till
   one or two--the afternoons being left to committees. After Nov. 9,
   1647, we find no mention of the Scotch Commissioners. But the Assembly
   continued to drag out a shadowy existence, with scanty and irregular
   attendance, as a standing committee for the examination and ordination
   of candidates for the ministry, meeting every Thursday, [1443] till
   March 25, 1652, when it informally broke up before the dissolution of
   the 'Rump' Parliament by Oliver Cromwell (April 19, 1653). 'It dwindled
   away by degrees, though never legally dissolved,' says Fuller. It
   vanished with the Long Parliament which gave it birth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1385] It is characteristic that Dr. Niemeyer published his collection
   of Reformed Confessions, the most complete we have, at first without
   the Westminster Standards, being unable to find a copy, and issued them
   afterwards in a supplement. Dr. Winer barely mentions the Westminster
   Confession in his Symbolik, and never quotes from it. If German Church
   historians (including Gieseler) were to be judged by their knowledge of
   English and American affairs, they would lose much of the esteem in
   which they are justly held. What lies westward is a terra incognita to
   most of them. They are much more at home in the by-ways of the remote
   past than in the living Church of the present, outside of Germany.

   [1386] Clarendon, who hated Presbyterianism as a plebeian religion
   unfit for a gentleman, disposes of the Westminster Assembly in a few
   summary and contemptuous sentences: 'Of about one hundred and twenty
   members,' he says, 'of which the Assembly was to consist, a few very
   reverend and worthy persons were inserted; yet of the whole number
   there were not above twenty who were not declared and avowed enemies of
   the doctrine or discipline of the Church of England; some were infamous
   in their lives and conversations, and most of them of very mean parts
   in learning, if not of scandalous ignorance; and of no other reputation
   but of malice to the Church of England.' These charges are utterly
   without foundation, and belong to the many misrepresentations and
   falsehoods which disfigure his otherwise classical History of the
   Rebellion. The number of members was 151.

   [1387] In his Fragments of a History of England (1670), Milton speaks
   both of the Long Parliament and the Assembly in vindictive scorn, and
   calls the latter 'a certain number of divines neither chosen by any
   rule or custom ecclesiastical, nor eminent for either piety or
   knowledge above others left out; only as each member of Parliament, in
   his private fancy, thought fit, so elected one by one.' He charges them
   with inconsistency in becoming pluralists and nonresidents, and with
   intolerance, as if 'the spiritual power of their ministry were less
   available than bodily compulsion,' and the authority of the magistrate
   'a stronger means to subdue and bring in conscience than evangelical
   persuasion.' On his unhappy marriage and his tracts on Divorce growing
   out of it, see Masson, Vol. III. pp. 42 sqq.

   into the milk-house to kill a mouse, she sends her maid to look after
   the cat, lest the cat eat up the cream.'--Selden, Table-Talk, p. 169.
   (Quoted by Stoughton and Stanley.)

   [1391] Laud says of the Assembly: 'The greatest part of them were
   Brownists, or Independents, or New England ministers, if not worse; or
   at best enemies to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of
   England,' The facts are, that the Independents were a small minority,
   and that New England was not represented at all.

   [1401] Even Whitgift, however, did not go to the extreme of jure divino
   Episcopacy, but admitted that the Scripture has not set down 'any one

   Calvin and Beza advocated the death penalty for heretics.

   [1405] The Smectymnuans were Stephen Marshall, Edmund Calamy, Thomas

   oddity and ugliness of the title, composed of the initials of each
   author, helped the circulation and provoked witty rhymes, such as

   'The Sadducees would raise the question,

   Who must be Smec at the resurrection.'

   [1406] One of the dividing questions was that of ruling elders. 'Sundry
   of the ablest,' says Baillie (Vol. II. pp. 110 sq.), 'were flat against
   the institution of any such officer by divine right, such as Dr. Smith,
   Dr. Temple, Mr. Gataker, Mr. Vines, Mr. Price, Mr. Hall, and many more,
   besides the Independents, who truly spake much and exceedingly well.
   The most of the Synod was in our opinion, and reasoned bravely for it;
   such as Mr. Seaman, Mr. Walker, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Newcomen, Mr. Young,
   Mr. Calamy. Sundry times Mr. Henderson, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Gillespie,
   all three spoke exceedingly well. When all were tired, it came to the
   question. There was no doubt but we would have carried it by far most
   voices; yet because the opposites were men very considerable, above all
   gracious little Palmer, we agreed upon a committee to satisfy, if it
   were possible, the dissenters.' He afterwards expresses the hope that
   the advance of the Scotch army 'will much assist our arguments.'

   [1407] Quoted by Neal, Vol. I. p. 493.

   [1408] The others were Jeremiah Burroughs, William Bridge, and Sydrach
   Simpson. These five were the signers of the 'Apologetic Narration.'
   Afterwards William Carter, William Greenhill, John Bond (perhaps also
   Anthony Burgess), joined them. Baillie (Vol. II. p. 110) counts ten or
   eleven, including Carter, Caryl, Philips, and Sterry. Among its
   lay-assessors lord Viscount Say and Seale and Sir Harry Vane
   sympathized with the Independents. Neal says: 'Their numbers were small
   at first, though they increased prodigiously and grew to a considerable
   figure under the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell.'

   [1409] Baillie declares 'liberty of conscience and toleration of all or
   any religion' (as advocated by Roger Williams against John Cotton) to
   be 'so prodigious an impiety that this religious Parliament can not but
   abhor the very naming of it.'--Tracts on Liberty of Conscience
   [published by the Hansard Knollys Society), p. 270, note. But Baillie
   was opposed to the employment of 'secular violence' in dealing with
   heretics. See M'Crie, p. 191.

   and Lightfoot's Journal; on the Presbyterian side, Gillespie's Aaron's

   Vindicated (dedicated to the Westminster Assembly; a very learned book
   of 590 pages), and Rutherford's Divine Right of Church Government (both
   published in London, 1646). The Erastian controversy was afterwards
   transferred to Scotland, and led to several secessions. Comp. Principal

   Mitchell, in his Introduction to the Minutes, pp. lxxxi.-lxxxiv., where
   they are given in the order of the ordinance of Parliament calling the
   Assembly (dated June 12, 1643), with some twenty members subsequently
   added to fill vacancies. Meek gives various lists in his edition of
   Gillespie's Notes. Neal's list has several errors. Much information on
   the leading members may be gathered from Baillie's Journals, Fuller's
   Church History and Worthies of England, Anthony Wood's Athenæ et Fasti
   Oxonienses, Neal's History of the Puritans, Stoughton's historical
   works, and Masson's Milton. Reid gives biographical sketches of the
   Westminster divines in alphabetical order, with lists of their works.

   [1417] Worthies of England, Vol. I. p. 93. Dr. Owen, though he wrote
   against him, called him, 'the veteran leader, so well trained in the
   scholastic field; this great man; the very learned and illustrious
   Twisse.' M'Crie describes him as 'a venerable man, verging on seventy
   years of age, with a long, pale countenance, an imposing beard, lofty
   brow, and meditative eye; the whole contour indicating a life spent in
   severe and painful study' (Annals of the English Presbytery, p. 145).
   The last words of Twisse were, 'Now at length I shall have leisure to
   follow my studies to all eternity.'

   [1418] 'The presence of such a man in the chair is sufficient to redeem
   the Assembly from the charge of illiberality or vulgar
   fanaticism.'--M'Crie, p. 151.

   continues to this day, and has recently (under the pastorate of Dr.
   Joseph Parker) erected the City Temple, with a memorial tablet to
   Goodwin in the vestibule.

   [1423] His austerity gave rise to the story related by Addison, in the
   Spectator, that Dr. Goodwin, 'with half-a-dozen night-caps on his head
   and religious horror in his countenance,' overawed and terrified an
   applicant for examination in Oxford by asking him in a sepulchral
   voice, 'Are you prepared for death?' His works were published in
   London, 1681-1704, in 5 vols.

   [1424] This fact has recently been discovered by Rev. A. B. Grosart
   (1864). See Masson, Vol. II. p. 520.

   [1433] The origin of the name is uncertain. Some derive it from the
   tapestries or pictures of Jerusalem on the wall. Dr. Stoughton, who is
   well informed in English history and archaeology, informs me (by letter
   of May 4, 1876) that it probably arose 'from the fact of its adjoining
   the sanctuary, the place of peace;' and he quotes a passage from the
   account of King John's death: 'Nec providet quod est Romæ ecclesia
   Jerusalem dicta, id est, visio pacis; quia quicunque illuc confugerit,
   cuiuscunque criminis obnoxius, subsidium invenit' (William of

   Stanley's Memorials of Westminster Abbey, pp. 417 sqq. I may be
   permitted to add from personal experience an interesting recent
   incident in the history of that chamber. At the kind invitation of the
   Dean of Westminster, the delegates to the International Council of
   Presbyterian Churches, then meeting in London for the formation of a
   Presbyterian Alliance, repaired to the Jerusalem Chamber on Thursday
   afternoon, July 22, 1875, and, standing around the long table, were
   instructed and entertained by the Dean, who, modestly taking 'the
   Moderator's chair,' gave them a graphic historical description of the
   chamber, interspersed with humorous remarks and extracts from Baillie.
   He dwelt mainly on the Westminster Assembly, promising, in his
   broad-Church liberality, at some future time to honor that Assembly by
   a picture on the northern wall. Dr. McCosh, as Moderator of the
   Presbyterian Council, proposed a vote of thanks for the courtesy and
   kindness of the Dean, which was, of course, unanimously and heartily
   given. The writer of this expressed the hope that the Jerusalem Chamber
   may yet serve a still nobler purpose than any in the past, namely, the
   reunion of Christendom on the basis of God's revealed truth in the
   Bible; and he alluded to the fact that the Dean had recently (in the
   'Contemporary Review,' and in an address at Saint Andrews) paid a high
   compliment to the Westminster Confession by declaring its first
   chapter, on the Holy Scriptures, to be one of the best, if not the very
   best symbolical statement ever made.

   § 94. The Westminster Confession.

   I. Standard Editions.

   1. English.

   The editio princeps, without Scripture texts, was printed, but not
   published, Dec. 7, 1646, at London, under the title, 'The Humble |
   Advice | of the | Assembly | of | Divines, | Now by authority of
   Parliament | sitting at Westminster, | concerning | a Confession of
   Faith, | presented by them lately to both Houses | of Parliament. | ...
   London. Printed for the Company of Stationers.' 1647.

   A second edition (of 600 copies) was printed in London, under the same
   title, 'with the Quotations and Texts of Scripture annexed,' by order
   of Parliament, dated April 29, 1647.

   The first Edinburgh ed. is a reprint of the second London ed. in
   somewhat different type. Only 300 copies were printed, Aug. 9, 1647,
   for the use of the General Assembly. See fac-simile in Vol. III. p.
   598.

   The typography and paper of these early editions are very poor. After
   the adoption, innumerable editions appeared under the proper title,
   'Confession of Faith.' The earliest small ed. of Edinb. appeared 1650;
   the earliest small ed. in Lond., 1648 or 1649. See Minutes, p. 418,
   note 4.

   The edition which was adopted by the English Parliament, with some
   changes (similar to those afterwards made in the Savoy Declaration),
   bears a different title, viz.: Articles | of | Christian Religion, |
   Approved and Passed by both Houses | of Parliament, | After Advice had
   with the Assembly | of | Divines | by | Authority of Parliament sitting
   at | Westminster. | London: | . . . June 27, 1648.

   Copies of the earliest and other rare editions I found and compared in
   the British Museum, in the Libraries of Edinburgh, the Free Church
   College and the Advocates' Libraries, and that of Union Theol. Seminary
   in New York. The texts vary but slightly. I used also a London ed. of
   1658 (pp. 108), which is a little superior in typography, and still
   bears the title Humble Advice, etc. It has the Scripture proofs printed
   out in full.

   Prof. Mitchell proposes to publish, with other documents, 'a careful
   collation of the earlier editions of the Confession' (Minutes, p. 546).

   A very good edition of the Westminster Confession of Faith and
   Catechisms, together with the Covenants (National and Solemn League),
   the acts of Parliament and the General Assembly relative to and
   approving of the same, was printed by authority at Edinburgh
   (University Press), 1858 (pp. 561).

   The American editions differ from the English and Scotch in Chaps.
   XXIII. and XXXI., and in the close of XX. The changes are given in Vol.
   III. pp. 600 sqq.

   2. Latin.

   Confessio Fidei in Conventu theologorum authoritate Parliamenti
   Anglicani indicto elaborata; eidem Parliamento postmodum exhibita; quin
   et ab eodem, deinque ab Ecclesia Scoticana cognita et approbata; una
   cum Catechismo duplici, majori, minorique; e sermone Anglicano summa
   cum fide in Latinum versa. Cantabrigiæ, 1656 and 1659, small 8vo (229
   pp.). Other eds., Edinb. 1670, 1694, 1708, 1711; Glasgow, 1660; in the
   appendix to Niemeyer's Collectio Conf. 1840. See Vol. III. pp. 600 sqq.
   The translation is good, but the translator is not named, nor could I
   ascertain his name from the librarians in Edinburgh and London, not
   even from the learned Mr. David Laing and Dr. Mitchell. The initials
   below the preface are 'G. D.' (perhaps G. Dillingham, D.D., of Emanuel
   College, Cambridge; others surmised G. Duport, of Cambridge).

   3. German.

   A German translation appeared as early as 1648. A new one in Böckel's
   Bekenntniss-Schriften der evang. reform. Kirche, pp. 683 sqq. (under
   the title Das puritanische Glaubensbekenntniss). Another version is
   published by the Presbyterian Board in Philadelphia.

   REVISION OF THE ENGLISH ARTICLES.

   The Assembly was at first employed for ten weeks on a revision of the
   Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, being directed by an
   order of Parliament (July 5, 1643) 'to free and vindicate the doctrine
   of them from all aspersions and false interpretations.' The Puritans
   regarded the doctrinal Articles as sound and orthodox in substance and
   spirit, but capable of improvement in the line marked out by the
   Lambeth Articles and the Irish Articles; in other words, they desired
   to make them more explicitly Calvinistic.

   Fifteen of these Articles, including the most important doctrines, were
   thus revised, and provided with Scripture proofs. [1444] Very few
   changes were made. Art. I., on the Trinity, was left untouched. In Art.
   II., on the Son of God, the word 'all' before 'actual sins of men' is
   missing, which, if not an oversight, was a misimprovement in the
   interest of Calvinistic particularism. [1445] In Art. III. the
   unhistorical interpretation of Christ's descent into Hades, which makes
   it a mere repetition of the preceding clause in the Creed, is put in.
   In Art. VI. the allusion to the Apocrypha is omitted. The remaining
   Articles are retained with some verbal improvements, except Art. VIII.
   of the three Creeds, which is omitted in almost all the printed copies.
   But in the original copy which the Assembly sent to Parliament, Art.
   VIII. was retained with a slight verbal change, [1446] and omitted in
   the copy which Parliament sent to the King at the Isle of Wight. The
   Assembly certainly had no objection to the doctrine of the oecumenical
   creeds, and teaches it in its own standards. And yet the omission of
   all allusion to them in the Confession of Faith is so far
   characteristic as it reveals a difference of stand-point. The Puritan
   Assembly was unwilling to adopt any rule of faith except the Scripture
   explained by itself; while the Episcopal Church was reformed on the
   basis of the Scripture as interpreted by the ancient Church, or at all
   events with respectful reference to primitive creeds and canons.

   The work of revision was suspended by an order of Parliament, Oct. 12,
   1643, requiring the Assembly to enter upon the work of Church
   government, and then given up in consequence of an order 'to frame a
   Confession of Faith for the three kingdoms, according to the Solemn
   League and Covenant.' The framing of the Westminster Confession is
   therefore due to Scotch influence and the adoption of the Solemn League
   and Covenant. [1447]

   This was a wise conclusion. The alteration or reconstruction of an
   established creed (except in minor particulars) is in itself a
   difficult and ungrateful task, and more apt to produce confusion than
   harmony, as is shown by the history of the Nicene Creed and the
   Augsburg Confession.

   PREPARATION OF THE CONFESSION.

   The first appointment of a Committee to prepare matter for a joint
   Confession of Faith was made Aug. 20, 1644, and embraced, besides the
   Commissioners of the Church of Scotland, the following Englishmen: Dr.
   Gouge, Mr. Gataker, Mr. Arrowsmith, Dr. Temple, Mr. Burroughs, Mr.
   Burges, Mr. Vines, Dr. Goodwin, and Dr. Hoyle. The chairman, Dr.
   William Gouge, a graduate of Cambridge, was Minister of Blackfriars,
   London (from 1608), and stood in high veneration among the Puritans,
   there being 'scarce a lord or lady or citizen of quality in or about
   the city that were piously inclined but they sought his acquaintance.'
   [1448] He died Dec. 12, 1653, seventy-nine years of age. The Committee
   was enlarged Sept. 4, 1644, by adding Messrs. Palmer, Newcomen, Herle,
   Reynolds, Wilson, Tuckney, Smith, Young, Ley, and Sedgwicke. [1449]

   This Committee, it seems, prepared the material and reported in the
   434th session, May 12, 1645, when a smaller Committee was appointed to
   digest the material into a formal draught. The members were taken from
   the old Committee, with Dr. Gouge as chairman. The Scotch Commissioners
   were to be again consulted. [1450] On July 7th, 1645, Dr. Temple made a
   report of a part of the Confession touching the Holy Scripture, which
   was read and debated. [1451] The following day, Reynolds, Herle, and
   Newcomen, to whom were afterwards added Tuckney and Whitaker, were
   appointed a Committee 'to take care of the wording of the Confession,
   as it is voted in the Assembly from time to time, and report to the
   Assembly when they think fit there should be any alteration in the
   words,' after first consulting 'with the Scotch Commissioners or any
   one of them.' [1452] In the 470th session, July 16, 1645, the heads of
   the Confession were distributed among three large committees to be
   elaborated and prepared for more formal discussion. [1453] The chapters
   were reported, read, and debated, section by section, and sometimes
   word by word.

   The sub-committees sat two days every week, and reported as they
   progressed. On Sept. 25, 1646, the title was fixed ('The Humble
   Advice,' etc.) and the first nineteen chapters were sent up to the
   House of Commons at their request. A few days afterwards (Oct. 1) a
   duplicate was sent to the House of Lords. [1454] The House of Lords
   passed these chapters, after a third reading, unanimously (Nov. 6). The
   House of Commons delayed definite action till the whole was presented.
   In the 752d Session, Dec. 4, 1646, the Confession was completed and
   presented to both Houses of Parliament in a copy transcribed with great
   pains by Dr. Burgess, for which he received a vote of thanks from the
   Assembly. [1455]

   The Confession was thus prepared in two years and three months, amid
   many interruptions by discussions on the Catechism and on discipline.
   No other symbolical book cost so much time and labor, except the
   Tridentine and Vatican Decrees, and perhaps the Lutheran Formula of
   Concord. Besides the chairman, Drs. Tuckney, Arrowsmith, Reynolds
   (afterwards bishop), Temple, Hoyle, Palmer, Herle, and the Scotch
   divines seem to have been the chief authors of the work.

   The Confession was first printed Dec., 1646, or Jan., 1647, for the
   exclusive use of Parliament and the Assembly, without the Scripture
   proofs. The House of Commons, not satisfied, expressly requested the
   Assembly to send them the Scripture texts (April 22, 1647), which was
   promptly done (April 29). [1456] Whereupon the House of Commons ordered
   'that six hundred copies, and no more, of the Advice of the Assembly of
   Divines concerning the Confession of Faith, with the quotations and
   texts of Scripture annexed, presented to this House, and likewise six
   hundred copies of the Proceedings of the Assembly of Divines upon the
   Nine-and-thirty Articles of the Church of England, be forthwith printed
   for the service of both Houses and of the Assembly of Divines; and the
   printer is enjoined at his peril not to print more than six hundred
   copies of each, or to divulge or publish any of them.' [1457] At the
   same time a vote of thanks to the Assembly was passed 'for their great
   pains in these services.' This second edition. appeared May, 1647, and
   contains the received and ecclesiastically authorized text. It must not
   be confounded with the revised text of Parliament.

   THE ACTION OF THE PARLIAMENT.

   The House of Commons began, May 19, 1647, the consideration of the
   'Humble Advice,' chapter by chapter, resumed it in October, and
   completed it March 22, 1648. It made some alterations in the
   governmental chapters, and gave the document the title, 'Articles of
   Christian Religion approved and passed by both Houses of Parliament,
   after Advice had with the Assembly of Divines by authority of
   Parliament sitting at Westminster.' [1458]

   The House of Lords agreed to all the alterations, excepting to that on
   marriage, June 3, 1648. Whereupon the House of Commons, on the 20th of
   June, ordered 'that the Articles of Christian Religion sent from the
   Lords with some alterations, the which were this day read, and upon the
   question agreed unto, be forthwith printed and published.' The next day
   it was resolved 'that the texts of Scripture be printed with the
   Articles of Faith.'

   A copy of the authorized edition of these Articles is preserved in the
   British Museum. It differs from the Assembly's Confession by the
   omission of the entire Ch. XXX. (on Church Censures) and Ch. XXXI. (on
   Synods and Councils), and parts of Ch. XX. (§ 4) and Ch. XXIV. (§§ 5,
   6, and part of 4).

   When, after Cromwell's death, the Long Parliament was restored in 1659,
   it adopted the Confession with the exception of Ch. XXX. and Ch. XXXI.,
   and requested Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Calamy, and Mr. Manton to superintend
   the publication (March 5, 1660). [1459]

   The English Parliament thus twice indorsed the Westminster Confession
   as to its doctrinal articles, but retained an Erastian control over
   matters of discipline. With the restoration of the monarchy the
   Confession shared the fate of Presbyterianism in England.

   THE ACTION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF SCOTLAND.

   The Confession was at once brought to Scotland, and most favorably
   received. [1460] The General Assembly at Edinburgh, Aug. 27, 1647,
   after careful examination, adopted it in full as it came from the hands
   of the Westminster divines, declaring it 'to be most agreeable to the
   Word of God, and in nothing contrary to the received doctrine, worship,
   discipline, and government of this Kirk,' and thankfully acknowledging
   the great mercy of the Lord, 'in that so excellent a Confession of
   Faith is prepared, and thus far agreed upon in both kingdoms.' The
   Scotch Parliament indorsed this action, Feb. 7, 1649.

   Thus the Confession, as well as the two Catechisms, received the full
   sanction of the highest ecclesiastical and civil authorities of
   Scotland. But the royal sanction was not obtained till 1690, under
   William and Mary. [1461]

   It is a very remarkable fact that this Confession failed in its native
   land, and succeeded in foreign lands. The product of English Puritans
   became the highest standard of doctrine for Scotch and American
   Presbyterians, and supplanted the older Confession of their own
   Reformers. The Shorter Catechism, however, was for a long time
   extensively used in England.

   Another remarkable fact is that the English authors, with their sad
   experience of the laws of uniformity, never intended to make their
   Confession binding upon the conscience as a document for subscription,
   while the Scots adopted it at once. [1462] Dr. M'Crie accounts for this
   difference partly 'by national idiosyncrasies, partly by the extreme
   desire of the Scots to obtain that "covenanted uniformity" for which
   England was not prepared, but which Scotland, with a Church fully
   organized and a Parliament favorably disposed, regarded as the
   sheet-anchor of her safety, and to which afterwards, as a sacred
   engagement, she resolutely clung, in hope and against hope, in days of
   darkness and storms. In England Presbytery had yet to be organized, and
   at every step it encountered conflicting and neutralizing influences.'

   subscribed to--our having been burnt in the hand in that kind before;
   but [only] so as not to be publicly preached or written against'
   (quoted by M'Crie, Annals, p. 221). Baxter, also, while highly
   recommending the Westminster Standards, expressed the hope that 'the
   Assembly intended not all that long Confession and those Catechisms to
   be imposed as a test of Christian communion, nor to disown all that
   scrupled every word in it [them]. If they did, I could not have
   commended it for any such use, though it be useful for the instruction
   of families' (Sylvester's Life of Baxter, p. 122, quoted by M'Crie, p.
   222).

   § 95. Analysis of the Westminster Confession.

   SOURCES.

   The Westminster Confession sets forth the Calvinistic system in its
   scholastic maturity after it had passed through the sharp conflict with
   Arminianism in Holland, and as it had shaped itself in the minds of
   Scotch Presbyterians and English Puritans during their conflict with
   High-Church prelacy. The leading ideas, with the exception of the
   theory of the Christian Sabbath, were of Continental growth, but the
   form was entirely English.

   The framers of the Confession were no doubt quite familiar with
   Continental theology; Latin was then still the theological language;
   the Arminian controversy had excited the greatest attention in England,
   and agitated the pulpit and the press for years; the English Church was
   well represented at the Synod of Dort; several divines of the Assembly
   had spent some time in Holland, where they found a hospitable refuge
   from persecution under Charles I., and were treated with great respect
   by the Dutch ministers and divines. [1463]

   But while the Confession had the benefit of the Continental theology,
   and embodied the results of the Arminian controversy, it was not framed
   on the model of any Continental Confession, nor of the earlier Scottish
   Confessions, notwithstanding the presence and influence of the
   Commissioners from the Church of Scotland. On the contrary, it kept in
   the track of the English Articles of Religion, which the Assembly was
   at first directed to revise, and with which it was essentially agreed.
   It wished to carry on that line of development which was begun, several
   years before the Arminian controversy, by the framers of the Lambeth
   Articles (1595), and which was continued by Archbishop Ussher in the
   Irish Articles (1615). [1464] It is a Calvinistic completion and
   sharper logical statement of the doctrinal system of the Thirty-nine
   Articles, which stopped with the less definite Augustinian scheme, and
   left a considerable margin for different interpretations. In point of
   theological ability and fullness it is far superior to its
   predecessors.

   The Westminster Confession agrees more particularly with the Articles
   which were adopted by the Protestant Church in Ireland, but afterwards
   set aside by Archbishop Laud through the Earl of Strafford. This is
   manifest in the order and arrangement, in the titles of chapters, in
   phraseology, and especially in the most characteristic features of
   Calvin's theology--the doctrine of Predestination and of the
   Sacraments. The resemblance is so striking that it must have been
   intended for the purpose of showing the essential agreement of the
   Assembly with the doctrinal standards of the English and Irish
   Reformation. Ussher himself had pursued the same course and
   incorporated in his work the substance of the English Articles and the
   full text of the Lambeth Articles. He was a doctrinal Puritan, and
   although he declined the invitation to a seat in the Assembly, he was
   highly esteemed by the members for his learning, orthodoxy, and piety.
   His friend, Dr. Hoyle, Professor of Divinity at Dublin, belonged to the
   committee which framed the Confession. [1465]

   The following tables will illustrate the relation of the Westminster
   Confession to the preceding standards of the English and Irish Church.


   WESTMINSTER CONFESSION. 1647. IRISH ARTICLES. 1615.
   Chapter I.--Of Holy Scripture. Of Holy Scripture.
   VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor
   alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known,
   believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded and
   opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned,
   but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto
   a sufficient understanding of them. 5. Although there be some hard
   things in the Scripture, . . . yet all things necessary to be known
   unto everlasting salvation are clearly delivered therein; and nothing
   of that kind is spoken under dark mysteries in one place which is not
   in other places spoken more familiarly and plainly, to the capacity
   both of learned and unlearned.
   Chapter II.--Of God and of the Holy Trinity. Of Faith in the Holy
   Trinity.
   I. There is but one only living and true God, who is infinite in being
   and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or
   passions, etc. 8. There is but one living and true God, everlasting,
   without body, parts, or passions, of infinite power, wisdom, and
   goodness, etc.
   III. In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one
   substance, power, and eternity--God the Father, God the Son, and God
   the Holy Ghost. And in unity of this Godhead, there be three persons of
   one and the same substance, power, and eternity--the Father the Son,
   and the Holy Ghost. [English Art. I.]
   Chapter III.--Of God's Eternal Decree. Of God's Eternal Decree and
   Predestination.
   I. God from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his
   own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass; yet
   so as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered
   to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contingency of
   second causes taken away, but rather established. 11. God, from all
   eternity, did, by his unchangeable counsel, ordain whatsoever in time
   should come to pass: yet so as thereby no violence is offered to the
   wills of the reasonable creatures, and neither the liberty nor the
   contingency of the second causes is taken away, but established rather.
   III. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men
   and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others
   foreordained to everlasting death. 12. By the same eternal counsel God
   hath predestinated some unto life, and reprobated some unto death: of
   both which there is a certain number known only to God, which can
   neither be increased nor diminished. Lambeth Art. I. and III.]
   IV. These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are
   particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain
   and definite that it can not be either increased or diminished.
   V. Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before the
   foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and
   immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his
   will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his mere
   free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or
   perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as
   13. Predestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby,
   before the foundations of the world were laid, he hath constantly
   decreed in his secret counsel to deliver from curse and damnation those
   whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by
   Christ unto everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honor.
   14. The cause moving God to predestinate

   conditions, or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of
   his glorious grace. unto life is not the foreseeing of faith, or
   perseverance, or good works, or of any thing which is in the person
   predestinated, but only the good pleasure of God himself. For all
   things being ordained for the manifestation of his glory, and his glory
   being to appear both in the works of his mercy and of his justice, it
   seemed good to his heavenly wisdom to choose out a certain number
   towards whom he would extend his undeserved mercy, leaving the rest to
   be spectacles of his justice.
   VI. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the
   eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means
   thereunto. Wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are
   redeemed by Christ; are effectually called to faith in Christ by his
   Spirit working in due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and
   kept by his power through faith unto salvation. Neither are any other
   redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified,
   and saved, but the elect only. 15. Such as are predestinated unto life,
   be called according unto God's purpose (his Spirit working in due
   season) and through grace they obey the calling, they be justified
   freely, they be made sons of God by adoption, they be made like the
   image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, they walk religiously in
   good works, and at length, by God's mercy they attain to everlasting
   felicity. But such as are not predestinated to salvation shall finally
   be condemned for their sins. [English Art. XVII.; Lambeth Art. II.]
   VII. The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable
   counsel of his own will, whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as
   he pleaseth, for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures,
   to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to
   the praise of his glorious justice. [Comp. Irish Art. § 14: 'leaving
   the rest to be spectacles of his justice.'] 32. None can come unto
   Christ unless it be given unto him, and unless the Father draw him. And
   all men are not so drawn by the Father that they may come unto the Son.
   Neither is there such a sufficient measure of grace vouchsafed unto
   every man whereby he is enabled to come unto everlasting life. [Lambeth
   Art. VII., VIII., IX.]
   VIII. The doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be
   handled with special prudence and care, that men attending to the will
   of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may,
   from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their
   eternal election. 17. We must receive God's promises in such wise as
   they be generally set forth unto us in Holy Scripture; and in our
   doings, that will of God is to be followed which we have expressly
   declared unto us in the Word of God. [English Art. XVII.]
   So shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and
   admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant
   consolation, to all that sincerely obey the gospel. 16. The godlike
   consideration of predestination and our election in Christ is full of
   sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, etc.
   [English Art. XVII.]
   Chapter V.--Of Providence. Of the Fall of Man, etc.
   IV. [His providence] extendeth itself even to the first fall, and all
   other sins of angels and men, and that not by a bare permission, but
   such as has joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding, and
   otherwise ordering and governing of them in a manifold dispensation to
   his own holy ends: yet so as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth only
   from the creature and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous,
   neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin. 28. God is not the
   author of sin; howbeit he doth not only permit, but also by his
   providence govern and order the same, guiding it in such sort by his
   infinite wisdom as it turneth to the manifestation of his own glory,
   and to the good of his elect.
   Chapter VI.--Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, etc. Of Original Sin.
   V. This corruption of nature, during this life, doth remain in those
   that are regenerated: 24. This corruption of nature doth remain even in
   those that are regenerated; . . . And

   and although it be through Christ pardoned and mortified, yet both
   itself and all the motions thereof are truly and properly sin.
   howsoever for Christ's sake there be no condemnation to such as are
   regenerate and do believe, yet doth the apostle acknowledge that in
   itself this concupiscence hath the nature of sin. [English Art. IX.]
   Chapter VIII.--Of Christ the Mediator. Of Christ, the Mediator of the
   Second Covenant.
   II. The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and
   eternal God, of one substance and equal with the Father, did, when the
   fullness of time was come, take upon him man's nature, with all the
   essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin:
   being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the
   Virgin Mary, of her substance. So that two whole, perfect, and distinct
   natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together
   in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion. Which
   person is very God, and very man, yet one Christ; the only Mediator
   between God and man. 29. The Son, which is the Word of the Father,
   begotten from everlasting of the Father, the true and eternal God, of
   one substance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the
   blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect
   natures, that is to say, the Godhead and manhood, were inseparably
   joined in one person, making one Christ very God and very Man. [English
   Art. II.]
   Chapter XVI.--Of Good Works. Of Sanctification and Good Works.
   I. Good works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy Word, and
   not such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of
   blind zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention. 42. The works which
   God would have his people to walk in are such as he hath commanded in
   his Holy Scripture, and not such works as men have devised out of their
   own brain, of a blind zeal and devotion, without the warrant of the
   Word of God.
   Chapter XVII.--Of the Perseverance of the Saints. Of Justification and
   Faith.
   I. They whom God hath accepted in his Beloved, effectually called, and
   sanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away
   from the state of grace; but shall certainly persevere therein to the
   end, and be eternally saved. 38. A true, lively, justifying faith, and
   the sanctifying Spirit of God, is not extinguished, nor vanisheth away,
   in the regenerate, either finally or totally. [Lambeth Art. V.]
   Chapter XXI.--Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day. Of the Service
   of God.
   II. Religious worship is to be given to God the Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, and to him alone. 54. All religious worship ought to be given to
   God alone.
   VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men . . . do
   not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words,
   and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations, but also
   are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of his
   worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy. 56. The first day of
   the week, which is the Lord's day, is wholly to be dedicated unto the
   service of God; and therefore we are bound therein to rest from our
   common and daily business, and to bestow that leisure upon holy
   exercises, both public and private.
   Chapter XXIII.--Of the Civil Magistrate. Of the Civil Magistrate.
   III. The Civil Magistrate may not assume to himself the administration
   of the Word and 58. . . . Neither do we give unto him hereby the
   administration of the Word and sacraments,

   sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven. or the
   power of the keys, etc. [See English Art. XXXVII.]
   Chapter XXV.--Of the Church. Of the Church, etc.
   I. The Catholic or Universal Church, which is invisible, consists of
   the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered
   into one, under Christ, the head thereof; and is the spouse, the body,
   the fullness of him who filleth all in all. 68. There is but one
   Catholic Church, out of which there is no salvation: containing the
   universal company of all the saints that ever were, are, or shall be
   gathered together in one body, under one head, Christ Jesus.
   Chapter XXVIII.--Of Baptism. Of Baptism.
   I. Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus
   Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into
   the visible Church; but also to be unto him a sign and seal of the
   covenant of grace, of his ingrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of
   remission of sins, and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ
   to walk in newness of life. 89. Baptism is not only an outward sign of
   our profession, . . . but much more a sacrament of our admission into
   the Church, sealing unto us our new birth (and consequently our
   justification, adoption, and sanctification) by the communion which we
   have with Jesus Christ. [English Art. XXVII.]
   Chapter XXIX.--Of the Lord's Supper Of the Lord's Supper
   I. The sacrament of his body and blood . . . for the perpetual
   remembrance of the sacrifice of himself in his death, the sealing all
   the benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment
   and growth in him. 92. The Lord's Supper is not only a sign, but much
   more a sacrament of our preservation in the Church, sealing unto us our
   spiritual nourishment and continual growth in Christ. [English Art.
   XXVIII.]
   VII. Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in
   this sacrament, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet
   not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon
   Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of
   Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the
   bread and wine, yet as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of
   believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to the
   outward senses. 94. But in the inward and spiritual part the same body
   and blood is really and substantially presented unto all those who have
   grace to receive the Son of God, even to all those that believe in his
   name. And unto such as in this manner do worthily and with faith repair
   unto the Lord's table, the body and blood of Christ is not only
   signified and offered, but also truly exhibited and communicated.
   VIII. Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in
   this sacrament, yet they receive not the thing signified thereby; but
   by their unworthy coming thereunto are guilty of the body and blood of
   the Lord, to their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly
   persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with him, so are they
   unworthy of the Lord's table, and can not, without great sin against
   Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries, or be
   admitted thereto. 96. The wicked, and such as want a lively faith,
   although they do carnally and visibly (as St. Augustine speaketh) press
   with their teeth the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, yet in
   no wise are they made partakers' of Christ; but rather to their
   condemnation do eat and drink the sign or sacrament of so great a
   thing. [English Art. XXIX.]

   CONTENTS.

   Neal says: 'Though all the divines were in the anti-Arminian scheme,
   yet some had a greater latitude than others. I find in my MS. the
   dissent of several members against some expressions relating to
   reprobation, to the imputation of the active as well as passive
   obedience of Christ, and to several passages in the chapter on liberty
   of conscience and Church discipline; but the Confession, as far as
   related to articles of faith, passed the Assembly and Parliament by a
   very great majority.' [1466] Neal does not specify the differences to
   which he alludes. Since the publication of the Minutes we are enabled
   to ascertain them, at least to some extent, from the meagre and broken
   reports of debates on election and reprobation, on the fall of Adam, on
   the Covenants, on providence, free-will, creation, justification,
   sanctification, the sacraments, and other topics. In most cases the
   fact is simply mentioned that there was a debate; in others brief
   extracts of speeches are given which reveal minor differences of views,
   though not of parties, or even of schools. The debates on Church
   government were much more serious and heated. The harmony of so many
   scholars from all parts of England and Scotland, on a whole scheme of
   divinity, is truly surprising, and accounts for their sanguine hopes of
   securing a doctrinal uniformity in the three kingdoms.

   The Confession consists of thirty-three chapters, which cover, in
   natural order, all the leading articles of the Christian faith from the
   creation to the final judgment. It exhibits the consensus of the
   Reformed Churches on the Continent and in England and Scotland, which
   was one of the objects of Parliament intrusted to the Assembly.

   BIBLIOGRAPHY.

   Following the precedent of most of the Continental Reformed Confessions
   and the Irish Articles, the Westminster formulary properly begins with
   the Bible, on which all our theology must be based, and sets forth its
   divine inspiration, authority, and sufficiency as an infallible rule of
   faith and practice, in opposition both to Romanism, which elevates
   ecclesiastical tradition to the dignity of a joint rule of faith, and
   to Rationalism, which teaches the sufficiency of natural reason. It
   excludes the Jewish Apocrypha entirely from the Canon, while in the
   English and Irish Articles they are at least enumerated, though
   distinguished from the canonical books. [1467] The Confession gives to
   reason, or the light of nature, its proper place, distinguishes between
   the original Scripture and the translations, maintains the true
   exegetical principle of the self-interpretation of Scripture in the
   light of the Spirit that inspired it, and carefully avoids committing
   itself to any mechanical or magical or any other particular theory
   concerning the mode and degrees of inspiration, or obstructing the
   investigation of critical questions concerning the text and the
   authorship (as distinct from the canonicity) of the several books.
   [1468] It rests the authority of the Bible on its own intrinsic
   excellence and the internal testimony of the Spirit rather than the
   external testimony of the Church, however valuable this is as a
   continuous witness. [1469]

   No other Protestant symbol has such a clear, judicious, concise, and
   exhaustive statement of this fundamental article of Protestantism. It
   has been pronounced equal in ability to the Tridentine decree on
   justification. [1470] It may more aptly be compared to the Tridentine
   decree on Scripture and tradition (Sess. IV.) and the recent Vatican
   decree on the dogmatic constitution of the Catholic faith (Sess. III.),
   as far as this relates to reason and revelation, and may be regarded as
   the best Protestant counterpart of the Roman Catholic doctrine of the
   rule of faith. The Confession plants itself exclusively on the Bible
   platform, without in the least depreciating the invaluable aid of human
   learning--patristic, scholastic, and modern --in its own proper place,
   as a means to an end and an aid in ascertaining the true sense of the
   mind of the Holy Spirit, who through his own inspired Word must
   alternately decide all questions of the Christian faith and duty. It is
   clear that Protestantism must sink or swim with this principle.
   Criticism, philosophy, and science may sweep away human traditions,
   confessions, creeds, and other outworks, but they can never destroy the
   fortress of God's Word, which liveth and abideth forever.

   THEOLOGY AND CHRISTOLOGY.

   Ch. II., 'Of the Trinity,' and Ch. XVIII., 'Of Christ the Mediator,'
   contain one of the best statements of the Nicene doctrine of the
   Trinity and of the Chalcedonian Christology, as held by all orthodox
   Churches. On these articles the evangelical Protestant Confessions are
   entirely agreed.

   PREDESTINATION.

   Ch. III., 'Of God's Eternal Decree,' [1471] Ch. V., 'Of Providence,'
   Ch. IX., 'Of Free Will,' and Ch. XVIII., 'Of the Perseverance of the
   Saints,' are closely connected. They present a logical chain of ideas
   which make up what is technically called 'the Calvinistic system,' as
   developed first by Calvin himself against Romanism, then in Holland and
   England against Arminianism.

   This system had at that time a powerful hold upon the serious religious
   minds in England and Scotland, including many leading Episcopal divines
   (not of the Laudian type) who otherwise had no sympathy with
   Puritanism, and ridiculed it with bitter sarcasm, like Dr. South. Even
   the authorized English version of the Bible (1611) has been charged by
   Arminians with a Calvinistic bias, while Calvinists have never
   complained of any defect in this respect. [1472] The only question in
   the Assembly was as to the logical extent to which they should carry
   the doctrine of predestination in a confessional statement. The more
   consistent and rigorous scheme of supralapsarianism had its advocates
   in Westminster as well as in Dort, and was favored by Dr. Twisse, the
   Prolocutor, who followed Beza and Gomarus to the giddy abyss of
   including the fall itself in the absolute eternal decree as a necessary
   means for the manifestation of God's justice; but the infralapsarian
   (or sublapsarian) scheme of Augustine decidedly triumphed.
   Supralapsarianism has always remained only a private speculation.

   The Westminster Confession goes, indeed, beyond the two Helvetic
   Confessions, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Scotch Confession, and the
   Thirty-nine Articles; but it goes not a whit further than the Canons of
   Dort (which had the approval of the delegates of King James), the
   Lambeth Articles, and the Irish Articles. [1473] It teaches really no
   more on predestination than the great Catholic Augustine had taught in
   the fourth century, as well as two archbishops of Canterbury--Anselm in
   the eleventh, and Bradwardine in the fourteenth century. [1474] It
   gives, however, a clearer logical shape and greater prominence to the
   doctrine in the system by placing it among the first articles. It puts
   the fall with its sinful consequences only under a permissive (as
   distinct from a causal or effective) decree, and emphatically exempts
   God from all authorship of sin. [1475] It does not teach the horrible
   and blasphemous doctrine (so often unjustly and unscrupulously charged
   upon Calvinism) that God from eternity foreordained men for sin and
   damnation; but it does teach that out of the fallen mass of corruption
   God elected a definite number of men to salvation and 'passed by' the
   rest, leaving them to the just punishment of their sins.

   This is severe and harsh enough, but very different from a decree of
   eternal reprobation, which term nowhere occurs in the Confession. The
   difference is made more clear from the debates in the 'Minutes.'
   Several prominent members, as Calamy, Arrowsmith, Vines, Seaman, who
   took part in the preparation of the doctrinal standards, sympathized
   with the hypothetical universalism of the Saumur school (Cameron and
   Amyrauld) and with the moderate position of Davenant and the English
   delegates to the Synod of Dort. They expressed this sympathy on the
   floor of the Assembly, as well as on other occasions. They believed in
   a special effective election and final perseverance of the elect (as a
   necessary means to a certain end), but they held at the same time that
   God sincerely intends to save all men; that Christ intended to die, and
   actually died, for all men; and that the difference is not in the
   intention and offer on the part of God, but in the acceptance and
   appropriation on the part of men. [1476]

   Another important and modifying feature is that the Confession, far
   from teaching fatalism or necessitarianism, expressly recognizes the
   freedom of will, and embraces in the divine decrees 'the liberty or
   contingency of second causes' (Ch. III., 1). [1477] Herein it agrees
   with Ussher, Bullinger, and Calvin himself, and favorably differs from
   the Lutheran Formula of Concord, which (following the strong
   expressions of Luther and Flacius) unphilosophically represents the
   human will before conversion to be as passive as a dead log or stone.
   The Confession makes no attempt to solve the apparent contradiction
   between divine sovereignty and human freedom, but it at least
   recognizes both sides of the problem, and gives a basis for the
   assertion that God's absolute decrees have no causal effect upon the
   sinful actions of men, for which they alone are responsible.

   With the Calvinistic particularism the limitation of redemption [1478]
   is closely connected. The difference is chiefly one of logical
   consistency. It refers to the efficiency of redemption or its actual
   application. All were agreed as to its absolute sufficiency or its
   infinite intrinsic value. All could subscribe the formula that Christ
   died sufficienter pro omnibus, efficaciter pro electis. Dr. Reynolds,
   who seems to have defended the more rigorous view, said in the debate:
   'The Synod intended no more than to declare the sufficiency of the
   death of Christ; it is pretium in se, of sufficient value to all--nay,
   ten thousand worlds.' [1479]

   Nevertheless, behind the logical question is the far more important
   theological and practical question concerning the extent of the divine
   intention or purpose, viz., whether this is to be measured by God's
   love and the intrinsic value of Christ's merits, or by the actual
   result. On this question there was a difference of opinion among the
   divines, as the 'Minutes' show, and this difference seems to have been
   left open by the framers of the Confession. On the one hand, the
   closing sentences of Ch. III. 6 ('neither are any other redeemed by
   Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved,
   but the elect only'), and Ch. VIII. 8 ('To all those for whom Christ
   hath purchased redemption, he doth certainly and effectually apply and
   communicate the same'), favor a limited redemption, unless the word
   redeemed be understood in a narrower sense, so as to be equivalent to
   saved, and to imply the subjective application or actual execution.
   [1480] On the other hand, Ch. VII. 3 teaches that under the covenant of
   grace the Lord 'freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by
   Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved;
   and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his
   Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe.' This looks like
   a compromise between conditional universalism taught in the first
   clause, and particular election taught in the second. This is in
   substance the theory of the school of Saumur, which was first broached
   by a Scotch divine, Cameron (d.1625), and more fully developed by his
   pupil Amyrault, between A.D. 1630 and 1650, and which was afterwards
   condemned in the Helvetic Consensus Formula (1675). [1481]

   ANTHROPOLOGY.

   Chapters VI. to IX. present the usual doctrines of the Evangelical
   Reformed (Augustinian) anthropology, with the new feature of the
   Covenants. The doctrine of covenants belongs to a different scheme of
   theology from that of the divine decrees. It is biblical and historical
   rather than scholastic and predestinarian. It views man from the start
   as a free responsible agent, not as a machine for the execution of
   absolute divine decrees.

   Ch. VII. distinguishes two covenants of God with man, the covenant of
   works made with Adam and his posterity on condition of perfect and
   personal obedience, and a covenant of grace made in Christ with
   believers, offering free salvation on condition of faith in him. The
   covenant of grace again is administered under two dispensations, the
   law and the gospel. In the Old Testament it was administered by
   promises, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types
   and ordinances which forshadowed the future Saviour. Under the New
   Testament the covenant of grace is dispensed through the preaching of
   the Word and the administration of the Sacraments. There are therefore
   not two covenants of grace differing in substance, but one and the same
   under various dispensations.

   The exegetical arguments for the covenant of works are derived chiefly
   from Gal. iii. 10, 12, 21; Rom. iii. 20; x. 5; but these passages refer
   to the covenant of the law of Moses, not to a covenant in the primitive
   state, and lead rather to a distinction between the covenant of the law
   (which, however, was also a covenant of promise) and the covenant of
   the gospel (the fulfillment of the law and promise). [1482]

   The doctrine of covenants is usually traced to Dutch origin; but it was
   inaugurated after the middle of the sixteenth century by Caspar
   Olevianus (d. 1587), one of the authors of the Heidelberg Catechism, in
   a work on 'the Nature of God's Covenant of Mercy with the Elect,' on
   the basis of Jer. xxxviii. 31-34; Heb. viii. 8-12. [1483] Dr. Mitchell
   says that the Confession teaches no more on this subject than had been
   taught before by Rollock in Scotland and Cartwright in England. It is
   not probable, though not impossible, that the more fully developed
   theory of the covenants by John Coccejus was already known in England
   at the time when the Confession was framed. Coccejus likewise
   distinguishes the foedus operum or naturæ in the state of innocence,
   and a foedus gratiæ, after the fall, but he views the latter under
   three stages, the patriarchal or Abrahamic (oeconomia ante legem), the
   Mosaic (oeconomia sub lege and the Christian (oeconomia post legem).
   [1484]

   SOTERIOLOGY.

   Chapters X. to XVIII. contain the best confessional statement of the
   evangelical doctrines of justification, adoption, sanctification,
   saving faith, good works, and assurance of salvation. The statement of
   justification by faith is as guarded and discriminating on the
   Protestant side of the question as the Tridentine statement of
   justification by faith and works is on the Roman Catholic side.

   ECCLESIOLOGY.

   Chapters XXV. and XXVI. In the doctrine of the Church the Protestant
   distinction between the invisible and visible Church is first clearly
   formulated, and the purest Churches under heaven are admitted to be
   'subject to mixture and error.' Christ is declared to be the only head
   of the Church--a most important principle, for which the Church of
   Scotland has contended faithfully against the encroachments of the
   civil power through years of trial and persecution. On the subject of
   the independence and self-government of the Church in her own proper
   sphere, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (as also the Dissenting
   Churches in England, and all American Churches) are immeasurably in
   advance of all the Protestant Churches on the Continent, and even of
   the Church of England, which is still dependent on the crown and the
   will of a Parliament composed of professors of all religions and no
   religion.

   But while the Confession claims full freedom for the Church in the
   management of her own affairs, it claims no authority or superiority
   over the State like the hierarchical principle. It declares the Pope of
   Rome, who pretends to be the supreme head of the Church on earth, to be
   'that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition that exalteth
   himself in the Church against Christ and all that is called God' (2
   Thess. ii. 3, 4, 8, 9). [1485]

   The chapter on the Communion of Saints urges the duty of cherishing and
   promoting union and harmony with all Christians of whatever part of the
   visible Church. [1486]

   THE SACRAMENTS.

   The doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and Baptism, and the Lord's
   Supper in particular, in Chs. XXVII.-XXIX., is the Calvinistic theory
   which we have already discussed elsewhere. [1487] It is the same which
   is taught in all the Reformed Confessions--Continental, Anglican, and
   Scotch. This is admitted by candid scholars. 'On the doctrine of the
   sacraments,' says Marsden, an English Episcopalian, 'we do not perceive
   a shade of difference from the teaching of the Church of England.'
   [1488] And Dr. Mitchell, a Scotch Presbyterian, says: 'The teaching of
   the Confession on the Lord's Supper is the teaching of Cranmer,
   Latimer, and Ridley, of Hooker, Ussher, and many others, . . . as well
   as of Knox, who from his long residence in England, and with English
   exiles on the Continent, had thoroughly caught up their warm and
   catholic utterances. This teaching is as far removed from the bare
   remembrance theory attributed to the early Swiss Reformers as from the
   consubstantiation of Luther and the local or supra-local presence
   contended for by Roman Catholics and Anglo-Catholics. It is so
   spiritual, yet so really satisfying, that even some High-Churchmen have
   owned that it would be difficult to find a better directory in the
   study of questions relating to this sacrament than is supplied in the
   Confession of Faith.' [1489]

   THE CHRISTIAN SABBATH.

   Ch. XXI., ' Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day,' must be
   mentioned as (next to the Irish Articles) the first symbolical
   indorsement of what may be called the Puritan theory of the Christian
   Sabbath which was not taught by the Reformers and the Continental
   Confessions, but which has taken deep root in England, Scotland, and
   the United States, and has become the basis of a far stricter
   observance of the Lord's day than exists in any other country. This
   observance is one of the most prominent national and social features of
   Anglo-American Christianity, and at once strikes the attention of every
   traveler. [1490]

   The way was gradually prepared for it. Calvin's view of the authority
   of the fourth commandment was stricter than Luther's, Knox's view
   stricter than Calvin's, and the Puritan view stricter than Knox's.
   [1491] The Prayer-Book of the Church of England, by incorporating the
   responsive reading of the Decalogue in the regular service, kept alive
   in the minds of the people the perpetual obligation of the fourth
   commandment, and helped to create a public sentiment within the Church
   of England favorable to the Puritan theory, although practically great
   desecration prevailed during Elizabeth's reign. The 'judicious' Hooker,
   who was no Puritan, says: 'We are bound to account the sanctification
   of one day in seven a duty which God's immutable law doth exact
   forever.' [1492]

   Towards the close of Elizabeth's reign the Sabbath question assumed the
   importance and dignity of a national movement, and of a practical
   reformation which traveled from England to Scotland and from both
   countries to North America. The chief impulse to this movement was
   given in 1595 by Dr. Nicolas Bownd (or Bound), [1493] a learned Puritan
   clergyman of Norton in Suffolk. He is not the originator, but the
   systematizer or first clear expounder of the Puritan theory of the
   Christian Sabbath, namely, that the Sabbath or weekly day of holy rest
   is a primitive institution of the benevolent Creator for the benefit of
   man, and that the fourth commandment as to its substance (that is, the
   keeping holy one day out of seven) is as perpetual in design and as
   binding upon the Christians as any other of the Ten Commandments, of
   which Christ said that not 'one jot or one tittle' shall pass away till
   all be fulfilled. [1494]

   The work in which this theory was ably and earnestly vindicated proved
   to be a tract for the times. Heylin, a High-Church opponent, says 'that
   in a very little time it grew the most bewitching error, the most
   popular deceit that had ever been set on foot in the Church of
   England.' [1495] Fuller dates from it 'the more solemn and strict
   observance of the Lord's day,' and gives the following description of
   the effect produced by it:

   'It is almost incredible how taking this doctrine was, partly because
   of its own purity, and partly for the eminent piety of such persons as
   maintained it, so that the Lord's day, especially in corporations,
   began to be precisely kept, people becoming a law to themselves,
   forbearing such sports as [were] yet by statute permitted; yea, many
   rejoicing at their own restraint therein. On this day the stoutest
   fencer laid down the buckler, the most skilful archer unbent his bow,
   counting all shooting besides the mark; May-games and Morris-dances
   grew out of request, and good reason that bells should be silenced from
   gingling about men's legs, if their very ringing in steeples were
   adjudged unlawful; some of them were ashamed of their former pleasures,
   like children which, grown bigger, blushing themselves out of their
   rattles and whistles. Others forbore them for fear of their superiors,
   and many left them off out of a politic compliance, lest otherwise they
   should be accounted licentious.

   'Yet learned men were much divided in their judgments about these
   Sabbatarian doctrines. Some embraced them as ancient truths consonant
   to Scripture, long disused and neglected, now seasonably revived for
   the increase of piety. Others conceived them grounded on a wrong
   bottom, but because they tended to the manifest advance of religion it
   was pity to oppose them, seeing none have just reason to complain being
   deceived into their own good. But a third sort flatly fell out with
   these positions, as galling men's necks with a Jewish yoke, against the
   liberty of Christians: that Christ, as Lord of the Sabbath, had removed
   the rigor thereof, and allowed men lawful recreations; that this
   doctrine put an unequal lustre on the Sunday, on set purpose to eclipse
   all other holy days, to the derogation of the authority of the Church;
   that the strict observance was set up out of faction to be a character
   of difference, to brand all for libertines who did not entertain it.'
   [1496]

   The Puritan Sabbath theory was denounced and assailed by the rising
   school of High-Churchism as a Sabbatarian heresy and a cunningly
   concealed attack on the authority of the Church of England, by
   substituting the Jewish Sabbath for the Christian Sunday and all the
   Church festivals. [1497] Attempts were made by Archbishop Whitgift in
   1599, and by Chief Justice Popham in 1600, to suppress Bownd's book and
   to destroy all the copies, but 'the more it was called in the more it
   was called on;' its price was doubled, and 'though the book's wings
   were clipped from flying abroad in print, it ran the faster from friend
   to friend in transcribed copies, and the Lord's day, in most places,
   was most strictly observed. The more liberty people were offered the
   less they used it. . . . It was sport for them to refrain from sports.
   . . . Scarce any comment, catechism, or controversy was set forth by
   the stricter divines, wherein this doctrine (the diamond in this ring)
   was not largely pressed and proved; so that, as one saith, the Sabbath
   itself had no rest.' [1498]

   At last King James I. brought his royal authority to bear against the
   Puritan Sabbatarianism so called, and issued the famous 'Book of
   Sports,' May 24, 1618, which was afterwards republished, with an
   additional order, by his son, Charles I., no doubt by advice of
   Archbishop Laud, Oct. 18, 1633. [1499] This curious production formally
   authorizes and commends the desecration of the evening of the Lord's
   day by dancing, leaping, fencing, and other 'lawful recreations,' on
   condition of observing the earlier part by strict outward conformity to
   the worship of the Church of England. [1500] The professed object of
   this indulgence to the common people was to check the progress of the
   Papists and Puritans (or 'Precisians'), and to make 'the bodies more
   able for war' when his majesty should have 'occasion to use them.' The
   court set the example of desecration by balls, masquerades, and plays
   on Sunday evening; and the rustics repaired from the house of worship
   to the ale-house or the village green to dance around the Maypole and
   to shoot at butts. To complete the folly, King James ordered the book
   to be read in every parish church, and threatened clergymen who refused
   to do so with severe punishment. King Charles repeated the order. But
   in both cases it became the source of great trouble and confusion.
   [1501] Several bishops disapproved of it. Archbishop Abbot (the Puritan
   predecessor of Laud) flatly forbade it to be read at Croydon. The Lord
   Mayor of London commanded the king's own carriages to be stopped as
   they were passing through the city on a Sunday. James raged and swore,
   and countermanded the prohibition. The Lord Mayor yielded, with this
   answer: 'While I was in my power I did my duty, but that being taken
   away, it is my duty to obey.' Some clergymen, after reading the book
   from the pulpit, followed it up by a sermon against it, or by reading
   the fourth commandment--'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy'--and
   added, 'This is the law of God, the other the injunction of man.' Those
   who refused to read the royal Book of Sports were suspended from office
   and benefice, or even excommunicated by Laud and his sympathizing
   fellow-bishops. [1502] Many left England, and joined

   'The pilgrim bands, who crossed the sea to keep

   Their Sabbaths in the eye of God alone,

   In his wide temple of the wilderness."

   This persecution of conscientious ministers for obeying God rather than
   men gave moral strength to the cause of Sabbath observance, and rooted
   it deeper in the affections of the people. It was one of the potent
   causes which overwhelmed Charles and Laud in common ruin. The sober and
   serious part of the nation were struck with a kind of horror that they
   should be invited by the highest authorities in Church and State to
   destroy the effect of public worship by a desecration of a portion of
   the day consecrated to religion.

   On the Sunday question Puritanism achieved at last a permanent triumph,
   and left its trace upon the Church of England and Scotland, which
   reappeared after the licentious period of the Restoration. For,
   although the Church of England, as a body, never committed itself to
   the Puritan Sabbath theory, it adopted at least the practice of a much
   stricter observance than had previously obtained under Elizabeth and
   the Stuarts, and would never exchange it for the Continental laxity,
   with its disastrous effects upon the attendance at public worship and
   the morals of the people.

   The Westminster Confession, without entering into details or
   sanctioning the incidental excesses of the Puritan practice, represents
   the Christian rest-day under its threefold aspect: (1) as a divine law
   of nature (jus divinum naturale), rooted in the constitution of man,
   and hence instituted (together with marriage) at the creation, in the
   state of innocence, for the perpetual benefit of body and soul; (2) as
   a positive moral law (jus divinum positivum), given through Moses, with
   reference to the primitive institution ('Remember') and to the typical
   redemption of Israel from bondage; (3) as the commemoration of the new
   creation and finished redemption by the resurrection of Christ; hence
   the change from the last to the first day of the week, and its
   designation 'the Lord's day' (dies Dominica). And it requires the day
   to be wholly devoted to the exercises of public and private worship and
   the duties of necessity and mercy.

   To this doctrine and practice the Presbyterian, Congregational, and
   other Churches in Scotland, England, and America have faithfully
   adhered to this day. Yea, twenty-seven years before it was formulated
   by the learned divines of Westminster, the Pilgrim Fathers of America
   had transplanted both theory and practice first to Holland, and,
   finding them unsafe there, to the wild soil of New England. Two days
   after their landing from the Mayflower (Dec. 22, 1620), forgetting the
   pressing necessities of physical food and shelter, the dreary cold of
   winter, the danger threatening from wild beasts and roaming savages,
   they celebrated their first Sunday in America on a barren rock and
   under the stormy sky of heaven, and, in the exercise of the general
   priesthood of believers, they offered the sacrifices of contrite hearts
   and the praises of devout lips to their God and Saviour, on his own
   appointed day of holy rest; not dreaming that they were the bearers of
   the hopes and destinies of a mighty future and the founders of a
   republic stretching across a continent and embracing millions of
   intelligent Christian freemen. [1503]

   The political articles of the Confession touching the power of the
   civil magistrate and the relation of Church and State will be discussed
   hereafter (§ 97) in connection with the subject of religious toleration
   and the changes which have been introduced in later editions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1463] Dr. M'Crie (Annals, p. 177) asserts without proof that the
   'Westm. Conf. bears unmistakably the stamp of the Dutch theology in the
   sharp distinctions, logical forms, and judicial terms into which the
   reformed doctrine had gradually moulded itself under the red heat of
   the Arminian and Socinian controversies.' This is an error if we look
   to the direct source. See below.

   [1464] See pp. 658 and 662.

   [1465] This agreement was first brought to light and set forth in
   detail by Prof. Mitchell, of St. Andrews, in the pamphlet above quoted,
   and also in the Introduction to the Minutes, p. xlvii.

   [1466] Vol. II. p. 41.

   [1467] The Lutheran symbols make no such distinction and give no list
   of the canonical books. They have no separate article on the Scriptures
   at all, beyond the important statement in the introduction to the
   Formula of Concord.

   [1468] Thus we find that the Epistle to the Hebrews is named
   separately, and not included in 'fourteen Epistles of Paul,' as in the
   Belgic Confession. Canonicity is not necessarily dependent on a
   traditional view of authorship or genuineness.

   [1469] Ch. I. 5: 'We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the
   Church to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture, and the
   heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty
   of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole
   (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the
   only way of man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies,
   and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth
   abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding,
   our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine
   authority thereof is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing
   witness by and with the Word in our hearts.'

   [1470] While arguing against creeds and councils, Dean Stanley (in the
   Contemp. Rev. for Aug. 1874, p. 499) writes: 'Is there any single
   theological question which any council or synod has argued and decided
   with an ability equal to that of any of the great theologians, lay or
   clerical? The nearest approaches to it are the chapters on
   Justification in the Decrees of Trent, and on the Bible in the
   Westminster Confession.' Comp. also the remarks of Dr. Mitchell,
   Introd. to Minutes, p. xlix.

   [1471] The English and Scotch editions use the singular, some American
   editions the plural (as in the Catechisms). There was a dispute in the
   Assembly about decree and decrees. Several members were opposed to
   dividing the one, all-comprehending decree of God. Seaman said: 'All
   the odious doctrine of the Arminians is from their distinguishing of
   the decrees, but our divines say they are one and the same decree.'
   Reynolds differed. See Minutes, p. 151. But both Catechisms in all
   editions have decrees (comprehended under the one purpose of God; see
   Shorter Catechism, Quest. 7).

   [1472] The charge derives some plausibility from the fact that the
   supralapsarian Beza, by his Greek Testament and his Latin translation
   and notes, exerted a marked influence on the translators. It is
   supported chiefly by three passages. In Matt. xx. 23, the words 'it
   shall be given' are unnecessarily inserted (after the precedent of the
   Geneva version). In Acts ii. 47, we read, 'The Lord added to the Church
   such as should be saved,' instead of 'such as were being saved, or in
   the way of salvation' (tous sozomenous, not tous sothesomenous). In
   Heb. x. 38--'Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man draw
   back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him'--any man is inserted, with
   Beza ('si quis se subduxerit'), to distinguish the subject of
   huposteiletai from the dikaios of the first clause, and to evade an
   argument against the perseverance of saints. But the case here is
   doubtful.

   [1473] See the comparative table, pp. 762, 768. Ussher adhered to his
   views on predestination, which he had expressed in the Irish Articles.
   In his 'Method of the Christian Religion,' written in his youth, but
   revised and republished shortly before his death, he has even a
   stronger passage on reprobation than the Westminster Confession, viz.,
   'Did God, then, before he made man, determine to save some and reject
   others? A. Yes, surely; before they had done either good or evil, God
   in his eternal counsel set some apart upon whom he would in time show
   the riches of his mercy, and determined to withhold the same from
   others, upon whom he would show the severity of his justice.' See Vol.
   XI. of his Works; and Mitchell, p. liv. note.

   [1474] Bradwardine's treatise, De causa Dei adversus Pelagium, which
   leads even to supralapsarianism, was republished in London in 1618 by
   Archbishop Abbot, the Calvinistic predecessor of the anti Calvinistic
   Laud.

   [1475] Ch. V. 4: 'God, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor
   can be the author or approver of sin.'

   [1476] Calamy said, in a sermon before the House of Commons: 'It is
   most certain that God is not the cause of any man's damnation. He found
   us sinners in Adam, but made none sinners.' In the debate on redemption
   in the Assembly, he stated: 'I am far from universal redemption in the
   Arminian sense, but I hold with our divines in the Synod of Dort that
   Christ did pay a price for all, [with] absolute intention for the
   elect, [with] conditional intention for the reprobate in case they do
   believe; that all men should be salvabiles, non obstante lapsu Adami;
   that Jesus Christ did not only die sufficiently for all, but God did
   intend, in giving of Christ, and Christ in giving himself did intend,
   to put all men in a state of salvation in case they do obey.' . . .
   'This universality of redemption does neither intrude upon either
   doctrine of special election or special grace' (Minutes, p. 152). 'The
   difference is not in the offer, but in the application. For the word
   world [in John iii. 16] signifies the whole world' (p. 156). 'It can
   not be meant of the elect because of that whosoever believeth, and Mark
   xvi., "Preach the Gospel to every creature"' (p. 154). 'In the point of
   election I am for special election, and for reprobation I am for massa
   corrupta; . . . there is ea administratio of grace to the reprobate
   that they do willfully damn themselves' (p. 153). Seaman said: 'All in
   the first Adam were made liable to damnation, so all are liable to
   salvation in the second Adam. Every man was damnnabilis, so is every
   man salvabilis' (p. 154). Dr. Mitchell (pp. lvi. sqq.) shows that
   Arrowsmith, Gataker, and other members of the Assembly, in their
   private writings, agreed with Calamy. His interpretation of kosmos, in
   John iii. 16, is indeed the only tenable one, and seems to be favored
   by the exegetical tact of Calvin himself (in loc.), for Calvin the
   exegete is more fair and free than Calvin the theologian. Dr.
   Arrowsmith, who was a member of the Committees on the Confession and on
   the Catechisms, in his explanation of Rom. ix. 22, 23, justly presses
   the important difference between the passive katertismena and the
   active proetoimasen 'I desire,' he says, 'to have it punctually
   observed that the vessels of wrath are only said to be fitted to
   destruction, without naming by whom--God, Satan, or themselves;
   whereas, on the other side, God himself is expressly said to have
   prepared his chosen vessels of mercy unto glory. Which was purposely
   done (as I humbly conceive) to intimate a remarkable difference between
   election and preterition, in that election is a proper cause not only
   of salvation itself, but of all the graces which have any causal
   tendency thereunto, and therefore God is said to prepare his elect to
   glory; whereas negative reprobation is no proper cause either of
   damnation itself or of the sin that bringeth it, but an antecedent
   only; wherefore the non-elect are indeed said to be fitted to that
   destruction which their sins in conclusion bring upon them, but not by
   God. I call it a remarkable difference, because where it is once
   rightly apprehended and truly believed, it sufficeth to stop the mouth
   of one of those greatest calumnies and odiums which are usually cast
   upon our doctrine of predestination, viz., that God made sundry of his
   creatures on purpose to damn them--a thing which the rhetoric of our
   adversaries is wont to blow up to the highest pitch of aggravation. But
   it is soon blown away by such as can tell them, in the words of the
   excellent Dr. Davenant, "It is true that the elect are severally
   created to the end and intent that they may be glorified together with
   their head, Christ Jesus; but for the non-elect, we can not truly say
   that they are created to the end that they may be tormented with the
   devil and his angels. No man is created by God with a nature and
   quality fitting him to damnation. Yea, neither in the state of his
   innocency nor in the state of the fall and his corruption doth he
   receive any thing from God which is a proper and fit means of bringing
   him to his damnation."'--Chain of Principles, pp. 335, 336, etc.,
   edition 1659 (quoted by Mitchell, p. lxi.).

   [1477] Comp. Ch. IX. 1: 'God hath endued the will of man with that
   natural liberty that it is neither forced, nor by any absolute
   necessity of nature determined, to good or evil (Matt. xvii. 12; Deut.
   xxx. 19).

   [1478] The term atonement is not used in the Confession. The English
   Bible exceptionally renders Rom. v. 11, katallage (reconciliation), by
   atonement, which in its old sense (=at-one-ment) means reconciliation,
   but is now equivalent to expiation, satisfaction (hilasmos). Redemption
   (apolutrosis) is a wider term. This distinction should be kept in view
   in the explanation of the Confession.

   [1479] Minutes, p. 153. The ablest modern defendants of a limited
   atonement, Drs. Cunningham and Hodge (see his Theology, Vol. II. pp.
   544 sqq.), are as emphatic on the absolute sufficiency as Reynolds.
   Their arguments are chiefly logical; but logic depends on the premises,
   and is a two-edged sword which may be turned against them as well. For
   if the atonement be limited in design, it must be limited in the offer;
   or if unlimited in offer, the offer made to the non-elect must be
   insincere and hypocritical, which is inconsistent with the truthfulness
   and goodness of God. Every Calvinist preaches on the assumption that
   the offer of salvation is truly and sincerely extended to all his
   hearers, and that it is their own fault if they are not saved.

   [1480] Compare the remarks of Mitchell, p. lvii., who considers the
   language of the Confession in Ch. III. compatible with the liberal
   view, while the other passage, strictly construed, excludes it, unless
   'redemption' be there taken in the sense of Baxter, as meaning 'that
   special redemption proper to the elect which was accompanied with an
   intention of actual application of the saving benefits in time.' The
   difference of views came up again in the debate on the 68th question of
   the Larger Catechism. See Minutes, pp. 369, 392, 393.

   [1484] Coccejus, or Koch, was at first Professor in Bremen (his native
   place), then at Franeker, 1636, and last at Leyden, 1649, where he
   died, 1669. His chief work, Summa doctrinæ de foedere et testamento
   Dei, appeared in 1648 (a year after the Westminster Conf.) and again in
   1653. It was the first attempt of a biblical and exegetical theology in
   distinction from the scholastic orthodoxy which then prevailed in
   Holland. Coccejus was denounced by the orthodox as a Judaizing and
   Pelagianizing heretic. Comp. the article Coccejus and his School, by
   Dr. Ebrard. in Herzog's Real-Encykl. Vol. II. pp. 742 sqq.

   [1485] This statement, which is made also in other Protestant
   Confessions and in the Irish Articles (No. 80; see Vol. III. p. 540),
   does not unchurch the Church of Rome, or declare her ordinances
   invalid; for Antichrist sits in the temple of God, and there is a
   material difference between the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church,
   as there is between the Jewish hierarchy and the people of Israel.

   [1486] Presbyterians therefore act in perfect consistency with their
   Confession if they take a leading part in all Bible Societies, Tract
   Societies, the Evangelical Alliance, and other catholic societies. They
   are among the most liberal of orthodox denominations in the support of
   these societies.

   [1489] Introduction to Minutes, p. lxviii.

   [1490] The most recent manifestation of the national American sentiment
   was the closing of the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia (1876) on
   the Lord's day.

   [1491] There is a tradition that Knox once called on Calvin on Sunday,
   and found him enjoying the recreation of bowling on a green. Knox
   himself on one occasion had one or two friends taking supper with him
   on Sunday night, and no doubt considered this innocent (see Randolph's
   letter to Cecil, Nov. 30, 1562, quoted by Hessey, Bampton Lectures on
   Sunday, Lond. 1860, p. 270). On the other hand, it is a fact that the
   designation of 'Sabbath' for Sunday, and the enumeration of 'the
   breaking of the Sabbath' among the grosser sins, originated with Knox,
   or at all events in Scotland at his time. The First Book of Discipline,
   which was drawn up by Knox and five other ministers, abolishes
   Christmas, Circumcision, and Epiphany, 'because they have no assurance
   in God's Word,' but enjoins the observance of Sunday in these words:
   'The Sabbath must be kept strictly in all towns, both forenoon and
   afternoon, for hearing of the Word; at afternoon upon the Sabbath, the
   Catechism shall be taught, the children examined, and the baptism
   ministered. Public prayers shall be used upon the Sabbath, as well
   afternoon as before, when sermons can not be had.' The third General
   Assembly resolved, July 4, 1562, to petition the queen for the
   punishing of Sabbath-breaking and all the vices which are 'commanded to
   be punished by the law of God, and yet not by the law of the realm.'
   Similar acts occur in the Assemblies of 1575, 1590, and 1596. See
   Gilfillan's work on the Sabbath, and Appendix D to Mitchell's tract on
   the Westminster Confession, pp. 53 sqq.

   [1492] Eccles. Polity, Bk. V. ch. 70, sec. 9. The fifth book came out
   in 1597, two years after Bownd's book. Ussher, Leighton, Pearson,
   Beveridge, Cecil, and other leading divines of the Church of England
   take the same ground on the perpetuity of the fourth commandment, and
   so far agree with the Puritan theory. But the Puritan practice in
   Scotland and New England often runs into Judaizing excesses.

   [1493] He was a graduate of Cambridge, was suspended with others in
   1583 for some act of non-conformity, and died in 1607. Isaac Walton
   states (in his Life of Hooker) that he was offered by Whitgift the
   mastership of the Temple, but this seems inconsistent with the
   Archbishop's hostility to his book. Bownd wrote also The Holy Exercise
   of Fasting (1604); A Storehouse of Comfort for the Afflicted (1604);
   and a sermon on the Unbelief of Thomas for the Comfort of all who
   desire to believe, which armeth us against Despair in the Hour of Death
   (1608). There is a biographical sketch of Bownd in Brook's Lives of the
   Puritans, Vol. II. pp. 171-176.

   [1494] The first edition of Bownd's book appeared in 1595, and was
   dedicated to the Earl of Essex (see the title in Vol. V. p. 211 of
   Fuller's Church History, Brewer's ed.). The second and enlarged edition
   of 1606 was dedicated to the Bishop of Norwich and the Dean of Ely, and
   bears the following characteristic title (which somewhat differs from
   the title of the first): 'Sabbathum Veteris et Novi Testamenti: or, The
   True Doctrine of the Sabbath, held and practised of the Church of God,
   both before and under the Law, and in the time of the Gospel: Plainly
   laid forth and soundly proved by testimonies both of Holy Scripture and
   also of old and new Ecclesiastical Writers, Fathers and Councils, and
   Laws of all sorts, both civil, canon, and common. Declaring first from
   what things God would have us straitly to rest upon the Lord's day, and
   then by what means we ought publicly and privately to sanctify the
   same. Together with the sundry Abuses of men in both these kinds, and
   how they ought to be reformed. Divided into two Books by Nicolas Bownd,
   Doctor of Divinity; and now by him the second time perused, and
   enlarged with an Interpretation of sundry points belonging to the
   Sabbath, and a more ample proof of such things as have been gainsaid or
   doubted of by some divines of our time, and a more full Answer unto
   certain objections made against the same: with some other things not
   impertinent to this argument.' London, 1606, 4to, pp. 479. Having been
   unable to obtain this rare work, I copied the title from Robert Cox,
   The Literature of the Sabbath Question (in 2 vols. Edinb. 1865), Vol.
   I. p. 145. There is a copy in the Bodleian Library, and another in the
   library of the University of Edinburgh. Cox himself is opposed to the
   Puritan theory, and holds the Church of England responsible for
   originating it by requiring the fourth commandment to be read and
   responded to in the Liturgy. Of Bownd's book he says: 'In the treatise
   bearing this long title the Sabbatarian opinions of the Puritans, which
   afterwards found more precise expression in the Westminster Confession
   and Catechisms, and are now maintained by the Evangelical sects in this
   country, were for the first time broadly and prominently asserted in
   Christendom.' Fuller gives a full account of the contents, Vol. V. pp.
   211 sqq. His editor, Brewer, says that Bownd's book 'is written in a
   truly Christian spirit, and ought by no means to be considered as the
   fruit of Puritan principles.' The accounts of Collier (Eccl. Hist. Vol.
   VII. pp. 182 sqq.), Neal (Vol. I. pp. 208 sq.), and Hesse (Sunday, pp.
   276 sqq.) are drawn from Fuller.

   [1495] Quoted by Hessey, p. 281.

   [1496] Vol. V. pp. 214 sqq.

   [1497] The chief writers against the Puritan theory were Thomas Rogers,
   Bancroft's chaplain (in his Preface to the Articles); and afterwards
   Bishop White of Ely (A Treatise of the Sabbath-Day . . . against
   Sabbatarian Novelty, Lond. 1635); Peter Heylin, Laud's chaplain (The
   History of the Sabbath, Lond. 2d ed. 1636); and Dr. John Pocklington
   (Sunday no Sabbath, Lond. 1636). See extracts from their works by Cox,
   1.c. Vol. I. pp. 166 sqq. White and Heylin wrote at the request of
   Laud. Bishop Prideaux (1622), Bishop Cosin (1635), and Dr. Young (1639)
   took a more moderate view. Richard Baxter (1671), though strongly
   leaning to the Puritanic side, tried to mediate between the strict
   Sabbath theory and the ecclesiastical Sunday theory, and maintained the
   joyous rather than the penitential character of the Lord's day. See
   Hessey, pp. 288 sq.

   [1498] Fuller, pp. 218, 219.

   [1499] Of the first edition no copy is known to exist. The second
   edition, of which a copy is preserved in the British Museum, bears the
   title: 'The Kings | Maiesties | Declaration to | His Subjects, |
   Concerning | lawfull Sports to | bee vsed. | Imprinted at London by |
   Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings | most Excellent Maiesties And by |
   the Assignes of John Bill. | M.DC.XXXIII.' 4to, 24 pp. This edition has
   been reprinted on tinted paper, in exact imitation of the original, at
   London (Bernard Quaritch), 15 Piccadilly, 1860. The Long Parliament, in
   1643, ordered the book to be burned by the common hangman, in Cheapside
   and other places.

   [1500] 'Our expresse pleasure therefore is, that. . . no lawfull
   Recreation shall bee barred to Our good People, which shall not tend to
   the breach of Our aforesayd Lawes, and Canons of Our Church: which to
   expresse more particularly, Our pleasure is, That the Bishop, and all
   other inferiour Churchmen, and Churchwardens, shall for their parts bee
   carefull and diligent, both to instruct the ignorant, and conuince and
   reforme them that are mis-led in Religion, presenting them that will
   not conforme themselues, but obstinately stand out to Our Judges and
   Iustices: Whom We likewise command to put the Law in due execution
   against them. 'Our pleasure likewise is, That the Bishop of that
   Diocesse take the like straight order with all the Puritanes and
   Precisians within the same, either constraining them to conforme
   themselues, or to leaue the Country according to the Lawes of Our
   Kingdome, and Canons of Our Church, and so to strike equally on both
   hands, against the contemners of Our Authority, and aduersaries of Our
   Church. And as for Our good peoples lawfull Recreation, Our pleasure
   likewise is, That after the end of Diuine Seruice, Our good people be
   not disturbed, letted, or discouraged from any lawfull recreation, Such
   as dauncing, either men or women, Archery for men, leaping, vaulting,
   or any other such harmelesse Recreation, nor from hauing of May-Games,
   Whitson Ales, and Morris-dances, and the setting vp of May-poles &
   other sports therewith vsed, so as the same be had in due & conuenient
   time, without impediment or neglect of Diuine Seruice.'--Book of
   Sports, pp. 8 sqq.

   [1501] Fuller says (Vol. V. p. 452): 'When this declaration was brought
   abroad, it is not so hard to believe as sad to recount what grief and
   distraction thereby was occasioned in many honest men's hearts.'

   [1502] Prynne says: 'How many hundred godly ministers have been
   suspended from their ministry, sequestered, driven from their livings,
   excommunicated, prosecuted in the High Commission, and forced to leave
   the kingdom, for not publishing this declaration, is experimentally
   known to all men.' For particulars, see Neal, Vol. I. pp. 312 sqq.

   § 96. The Westminster Catechisms.

   Editions.

   The Humble | Advice | of the | Assembly | of | Divines, | Now by
   Authority of Parliament | sitting at | Westminster; | Concerning | A
   Larger Catechism: | Presented by them lately to both Houses of
   Parliament. | Printed at London [Oct. 1647, without Scripture proofs],
   and reprinted at Edinburgh, by Evan Tyler, Printer to the King's most
   Excellent Majestie, 1647 [Dec.]. The Edinburgh reprint has fifty-six
   pages, and no Scripture proofs. See fac-simile in Vol. III. p. 674. Of
   the London editio princeps, six hundred copies were printed, but not
   published, by order of Parliament, for its own use. Of the Edinburgh
   editio princeps, eight hundred copies were ordered by the General
   Assembly, Dec. 23, 1647. The second ed., which appeared in London
   [after April 14, 1648], contains the proofs from Scripture.

   The Shorter Catechism appeared under the same title (except Shorter for
   Larger) a little later [after Nov. 25, 1647], by order of Parliament.
   Mr. John Laing, the obliging librarian of the Free Church College in
   Edinburgh, informs me that both Catechisms appeared in one vol. of
   seventy-nine pages, at Edinburgh, Dec. 23,1647, with a general title
   and a separate title for each. A statement to the same effect I see in
   the Advertisement to Dunlop's Collection of Confessions, Vol. I. p.
   clviii., with the additional remark that this edition was sent to the
   Presbyteries for examination.

   The Larger and Shorter Catechisms often appeared in connection with the
   Westminster Confession, and exist in innumerable English and American
   editions, especially the Shorter. The textual variations are
   insignificant, except that the American (General Assembly's) editions
   of the Larger Catechism omit the words 'tolerating a false religion' in
   the answer to Question 109.

   I have made use of the first Edinb. ed., and a large London ed. of
   1658, which contains the Conf. and both Catechisms under their original
   (three separate) titles (The Humble Advice, etc.), with the Scripture
   proofs in full. Opposite the special title of the Shorter Catechism is
   the order of Parliament, dated 'Die Lunæ 15. Septemb., 1648,' directing
   that the Shorter Catechism 'be forthwith printed and published, wherein
   Mr. Henry Roborough and Mr. Adoniram Byfield, Scribes of the Assembly
   of Divines, are requested to use all possible care and diligence.'

   The Catechisms have been translated into many languages, especially the
   Shorter. A Latin version appeared, together with the version of the
   Confession, in Cambridge, 1656, as has been noted above, p. 753. The
   Latin text of the Shorter Catechism is printed in Vol. III. pp. 676
   sqq. For a German version of both, see Böckel, pp. 716 sqq. A Greek
   version of the Shorter Catechism (with the Latin), by John Harmar
   (Regius Professor of Greek In Oxford), was published at London, 1660; a
   new one by Robert Young (he katechesis suntomotera), Edinburgh, 1854. A
   Hebrew version by G. Seaman, M.D. (London, 1689), and another by H. S.
   McKee (Edinb. 1854; Dublin, 1864). Also Syriac, Arabic, modern Greek,
   Portuguese, Welsh, and other versions.

   The largest number of editions and translations are to be found, as far
   as I know, in the British Museum.

   PREPARATION AND ADOPTION.

   Simultaneously with the Confession, the Assembly prepared first one,
   and afterwards two Catechisms: a larger one for public exposition in
   the pulpit, according to the custom of the Reformed Churches on the
   Continent, and a smaller one for the instruction of children, a clear
   and condensed summary of the former. [1504] Both are amply provided
   with Scripture proofs. The questions of Church polity and discipline
   are properly omitted.

   The Catechisms were finished and presented to Parliament for
   examination and approval in the autumn of 1647. [1505] Parliament
   ordered six hundred copies to be printed, and then examined and
   approved the Catechisms, with some slight exceptions (Sept. 15, 1648).
   The General Assembly at Edinburgh adopted the Larger Catechism, July
   20, 1648, and the Shorter Catechism, July 28, declaring both to be
   'agreeable to the Word of God, and in nothing contrary to the received
   doctrine, worship, discipline, and government of this Kirk.' These acts
   were approved by the Scottish Parliament, Feb. 7, 1649, but repealed
   under Charles II. in 1661. When the Scottish Parliament, in 1690,
   established Presbyterian government in Scotland, and ratified the
   Westminster Confession of Faith, no express mention was made of the
   Catechisms, but both continued in ecclesiastical use, and the Shorter
   Catechism was often earnestly enjoined upon ministers, teachers, and
   parents by the General Assembly. [1506]

   GENERAL CHARACTER.

   The two Catechisms are, in the language of a Scotch divine, 'inimitable
   as theological summaries; though, when it is considered that to
   comprehend them would imply an acquaintance with the whole circle of
   dogmatic and controversial divinity, it may be doubted whether either
   of them is adapted to the capacity of childhood. . . . Experience has
   shown that few who have been carefully instructed in our Shorter
   Catechism have failed to discover the advantage of becoming acquainted
   in early life, even as a task, with that admirable "form of sound
   words."' [1507]

   Both Catechisms have the peculiarity that each answer embodies the
   question, and thus forms a complete proposition or sentence in itself.

   Both depart from the catechetical tradition by omitting the Apostles'
   Creed, which in other orthodox Catechisms is the common historical
   basis of the exposition of the Articles of Faith. It is, however,
   annexed to the Shorter Catechism,' not as though it were composed by
   the Apostles or ought to be esteemed canonical Scripture, as the Ten
   Commandments and the Lord's Prayer, but because it is a brief sum of
   the Christian faith, agreeable to the Word of God, and anciently
   received in the Churches of Christ.' A note is attached to the article
   on the descent into Hell (better, Hades or Sheol), to the effect that
   it simply means Christ 'continued in the state of the dead and under
   the power of death until the third day.' This explanation (like that of
   Calvin and the Heidelberg Catechism) misses the true sense of the
   descent, and ignores its peculiar significance in the work of
   redemption for the world of the departed (comp. Luke xxiii. 43; Acts
   ii. 31; Eph. iv. 8, 9; 1 Cor. xv. 55, 57; 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19; iv. 6;
   Rev. i. 18). The eschatology of the Reformation standards is silent or
   defective on the middle state, and most Protestant versions of the
   Bible confound Hell and Hades, which represent separate and distinct
   though cognate ideas.

   THE LARGER CATECHISM.

   The Larger Catechism occupied, as the Minutes show, a good deal of the
   Assembly's attention during the year 1647, and was discussed question
   by question. It was prepared before the Shorter. [1508] It is chiefly
   the work of Dr. Anthony Tuckney, Professor of Divinity and
   Vice-Chancellor at Cambridge. [1509] It is a masterpiece of
   catechetical skill, superior to any similar work, and exhibits in
   popular form a complete system of divinity, like the Roman Catechism
   and the Longer Russian Catechism of Philaret. It also serves in part as
   a valuable commentary or supplement to the Confession, especially on
   the ethical part of our religion. But it is over-minute in the
   specification of what God has commanded and forbidden in the Ten
   Commandments, and loses itself in a wilderness of details. [1510]

   THE SHORTER CATECHISM.

   Dr. Tuckney was also the convener of the Committee which prepared the
   Shorter Catechism, but its concise and severely logical answers are
   traced to the Rev. John Wallis, M.A., an eminent mathematician, who as
   a young man fresh from Cambridge was appointed an amanuensis of the
   Assembly. [1511] He afterwards became Professor of Geometry at Oxford
   and one of the founders of the Royal Society. He was probably the last
   survivor of the Westminster divines, for he died 1703, aet.
   eighty-eight. [1512] Gillespie's name is traditionally connected with
   the question 'What is God?' He is said to have answered it in prayer,
   apparently without meditation, when the Assembly were in suspense for
   words to define the Being of beings. But the Scotch Commissioners had
   little to do with the Shorter Catechism, as most of them had left
   before it was discussed in the Assembly. [1513]

   The Shorter Catechism is one of the three typical Catechisms of
   Protestantism which are likely to last to the end of time. It is fully
   equal to Luther's and to the Heidelberg Catechism in ability and
   influence, it far surpasses them in clearness and careful wording, and
   is better adapted to the Scotch and Anglo-American mind, but it lacks
   their genial warmth, freshness, and childlike simplicity. [1514] It
   substitutes a logical scheme for the historical order of the Apostles'
   Creed. It deals in dogmas rather than facts. It addresses the disciple
   as an interested outsider rather than as a church-member growing up in
   the nurture of the Lord. Its mathematical precision in definitions,
   some of which are almost perfect, [1515] though above the capacity of
   the child, is a good preparation for the study of theology. Its use
   among three denominations (Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and
   Regular Baptists) proves its solid worth. Baxter called it 'the best
   Catechism he ever saw, a most excellent sum of the Christian faith and
   doctrine, and a fit test to try the orthodoxy of teachers.' Thomas
   Carlyle, in speaking against modern materialism, made this confession
   (1876): 'The older I grow--and I now stand upon the brink of
   eternity--the more comes back to me the first sentence in the Catechism
   which I learned when a child, and the fuller and deeper its meaning
   becomes: "What is the chief end of man? To glorify God, and to enjoy
   him forever."'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1504] The first Catechism of the Assembly, according to Baillie, was
   nearly agreed on at the end of 1644, but was never published. Perhaps
   it was the same which is partially inserted in the Minutes; or it may
   have been the MS. Catechism of Sam. Rutherford, which is preserved in
   the University library at Edinburgh. In the 774th session, Jan. 14,
   1647 (old style, 1646), the Assembly ordered 'that the Committee for
   the Catechism do prepare a draught of two Catechisms, one more large
   and another more brief, in which they are to have an eye to the
   Confession of Faith, and to the matter of the Catechism already begun'
   (Minutes, p. 321).

   [1505] Both Catechisms were first presented to Parliament without
   Scripture proofs, the Larger before Oct. 25, 1647, the Shorter on Nov.
   25, 1647 (Minutes, pp. 485, 486, 492), and were forthwith printed in
   London and Edinburgh. The Catechisms with Scripture proofs were
   presented to Parliament on or before April 14, 1648 (Minutes, p. 511).

   [1506] Mitchell, Minutes, p. 515. note. Innes (Law of Creeds, p. 195)
   says: 'The Shorter Catechism has been for many generations the real
   creed of Scotland, so far as the mass of the people is concerned.'

   [1507] M'Crie, Annals, pp. 177 sq. Neal (Vol. II. p. 42) judges
   similarly. 'The Larger Catechism,' he says, 'is a comprehensive system
   of divinity, and the smaller a very accurate summary, though it has by
   some been thought a little too long, and in some particulars too
   abstruse for the capacities of children.' Baillie was of the same
   opinion (Letters, III. 59).

   [1508] This appears from the Minutes, p. 410. The report on the Shorter
   Catechism was first called for in the 896th session, Aug. 9, 1647. Mr.
   Palmer reported, and Messrs. Calamy and Gower were added to the
   Committee. The opposite view is clearly wrong, though advocated by Neal
   (Vol. II. p. 42), and even quite recently by Dr. M'Crie, who says
   (Annals, p. 177): 'The Larger Catechism was not prepared till some time
   after the Shorter, of which it was evidently intended to form an
   amplification and exposition.'

   [1509] It is based in part on Ussher's catechetical Body of Divinity,
   perhaps also on the concise theological compendium of John Wolleb,
   Antistes at Basle (1626).

   [1510] Take for example Question 113:

   What are the sins forbidden in the third commandment?

   'The sins forbidden in the third commandment are, the not using of
   God's name as is required; and the abuse of it in an ignorant, vain,
   irreverent, profane, superstitious, or wicked mentioning, or otherwise
   using his titles, attributes, ordinances, or works, by blasphemy,
   perjury; all sinful cursings, oaths, vows, and lots; violating our
   oaths and vows, if lawful; and fulfilling them, if of things unlawful;
   murmuring and quarreling at, curious prying into, and misapplying of
   God's decrees and providences; misinterpreting, misapplying, or any way
   perverting the Word, or any part of it, to profane jests, curious or
   unprofitable questions, vain janglings, or the maintaining of false
   doctrines; abusing it, the creatures, or any thing contained under the
   name of God, to charms or sinful lusts and practices; the maligning,
   scorning, reviling, or any wise opposing God's truth, grace, and ways;
   making profession of religion in hypocrisy or for sinister ends; being
   ashamed of it, or a shame to it, by uncomformable, unwise, unfruitful,
   and offensive walking or backsliding from it.'

   [1511] In the Minutes, p. 488, Wallis is mentioned in connection with
   the Shorter Catechism. He published an exposition of it.

   [1512] Masson's Milton, Vol. II. p. 515.

   [1513] The Scotch Commissioners took leave Dec. 25, 1646. The last
   mention of them is Nov. 9, 1647, when Rutherford took his
   leave.--Minutes, pp. 471, 487. Dr. Mitchell informs me that the fourth
   question is probably derived from 'A Compendious Catechism' (by J. F.),
   printed at London in April, 1645: 'God is a Spirit, One, Almighty,
   Eternal, Infinite, Unchangeable Being, Absolutely Holy, Wise, Just, and
   Good.'

   § 97. Criticism of the Westminster System of Doctrine.

   The Westminster Confession, together with the Catechisms, is the
   fullest and ripest symbolical statement of the Calvinistic system of
   doctrine. In theological ability and merit it is equal to the best
   works of the kind, and is not surpassed by the Lutheran Formula of
   Concord or the Roman Decrees of the Councils of Trent and the Vatican.
   Its intrinsic worth alone can explain the fact that it has supplanted
   the older Scottish standards of John Knox and John Craig in the land of
   their birth, and that it was adopted by three distinct denominations:
   by the Presbyterians in full, and by the Congregationalists and the
   Regular Baptists with some slight modifications. Of these the
   Congregationalists had but a small though very able representation in
   the Westminster Assembly, the Baptists none at all. It has at this day
   as much vitality as any of the Protestant symbols and more vitality
   than most of them. It materially aids in shaping theological thought
   and religious activity as far as the English tongue prevails.
   Altogether it represents the most vigorous and yet moderate form of
   Calvinism, which has found (like Christianity itself) a more congenial
   and permanent home in the Anglo-Saxon race than in the land of its
   birth.

   The doctrines of the Confession are stated with unusual care, logical
   precision, clearness, caution, and circumspection, and with an eye to
   all their various aspects and mutual relations. Where they seem to
   conflict or can not be harmonized by our finite intelligence--as
   absolute sovereignty and free agency, the fall of Adam and personal
   guilt, the infinite divinity and the finite humanity of Christ--both
   truths are set forth, and room is left for explanations and adjustments
   by scientific theology within the general limits of the system. The
   important difference between a public confession of faith and a private
   system of theology was at least distinctly recognized in principle,
   although (as we shall see presently) not always consistently carried
   out. [1516]

   The style of the Confession and Catechisms is clear, strong, dignified,
   and well adapted to the grave subject. The selection of Scripture
   proofs is careful and judicious, and reveals a close familiarity with
   the sacred writings.

   The merits of the Westminster standards have been admitted not only by
   Presbyterians, [1517] but also by liberal Episcopalians, [1518] and
   even by Methodists, who entirely dissent from its theology. [1519]

   DEFECTS.

   The Westminster standards, like all human productions, including the
   translations of the Bible itself, have imperfections.

   The great revival of the sixteenth century was followed in the Reformed
   and Lutheran Churches by a dry scholasticism which was more biblical
   and evangelical than the mediæval scholasticism, but shared with it the
   defects of a one-sided intellectualism to the exclusion of the mystic
   and emotional types of Christianity. Scholasticism in the technical
   sense--whether Roman Catholic or Protestant--is the product of the
   devout understanding rather than the glowing heart, and approaches the
   deepest mysteries of faith, such as the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
   eternal decrees of election and reprobation of men and angels, with
   profound reverence indeed, yet with a boldness and assurance as if they
   were mathematical problems or subjects of anatomical dissection. [1520]
   It shows usually a marvelous dexterity in analysis, division,
   subdivision, distinction, and definition, but it lacks the intuition
   into the hidden depths and transcending heights where the antagonisms
   of partial truths meet in unity.

   The Westminster standards do not go so far in this direction as the
   Canons of Dort or the Helvetic Consensus Formula, but certainly further
   than the Reformation symbols, which are less logical and precise, and
   more fresh and elastic. They reflect the hard severity of Puritanism.
   They embody too much metaphysical divinity, and overstep the limits
   which divide a public confession of faith from a scientific treatise of
   theology. It would be impossible nowadays to pass such an elaborate
   system through any Protestant ecclesiastical body with a view to impose
   it upon all teachers of religion. The Confession, however, as already
   mentioned, was not intended as a yoke by the English framers, nor has
   subscription ever been required to all its details, but only to the
   general scheme. The Bible is expressly declared by Calvinists to be
   'the only infallible rule of faith and practice,' and the Confession is
   adopted 'as containing the system of doctrine taught in the holy
   Scriptures.' [1521]

   The chief characteristics of Calvinistic scholasticism as it prevailed
   in the seventeenth century are that it starts from God's sovereignty
   and justice rather than from God's love and mercy, and that it makes
   the predestinarian scheme to control the historical and christological
   scheme. This brings us to the most assailable point in the Westminster
   Confession and Larger Catechism, the abstract doctrine of eternal
   decrees, which will always repel a large portion of evangelical
   Christendom. We believe that the divine-human person and work of Christ
   furnish the true key to the full understanding of the plan of salvation
   and the solid platform for the ultimate agreement of all evangelical
   creeds.

   PRETERITION OF THE REST OF MANKIND.

   Absolute predestinarianism is the strength and the weakness of
   Calvinism. The positive decree of eternal election is its impregnable
   fort, the negative decree of eternal reprobation its Achilles' heel.
   Predestination to holiness and happiness, being a gracious purpose of
   God's love, is full of 'sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to
   godly persons,' [1522] and affords 'matter of praise, reverence, and
   admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation
   to all that sincerely obey the gospel.' [1523] Predestination to death
   and damnation, being a judicial decree of God's wrath on account of
   Adam's fall, is--whether true or false--a 'decretum horribile' (as
   Calvin himself significantly calls it, in view of the apparent ruin of
   whole nations with their offspring), and ought never to be put into a
   creed or confession of the Church, but should be left to the theology
   of the school. Hence it is wisely omitted by the Heidelberg Catechism,
   the Helvetic Confessions, the Thirty-nine Articles, and other Reformed
   symbols. Even the old Scotch Confession of John Knox does not mention
   it, and the Second Scotch Confession expressly rejects, as an
   antichristian error, the horrible popish doctrine of the damnation of
   unbaptized infants.

   The Westminster Confession, it is true, carefully avoids the term
   reprobation, and substitutes for it the milder idea of preterition. It
   uses the verb predestinate only with reference to eternal life, while
   the lost are spoken of as being ordained or judicially condemned to
   death. Yet it makes the dogmatic assertion that 'God was pleased,
   according to the unsearchable counsel of his own will, whereby he
   extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth, for the glory of his
   sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by the rest of mankind, and
   to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of
   his glorious justice.' [1524] Now there are indeed passages in the Old
   and New Testaments, especially the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the
   Romans, which seem to bear out this statement, [1525] but they must be
   interpreted in the light of the biblical idea of a God of infinite love
   and mercy, and in connection with other passages which in their obvious
   and natural sense declare that God sincerely desires all men to repent
   and be saved, that Christ is the Saviour of the world, that he is the
   propitiation not only for our sins, 'but also for the sins of the whole
   world,' and that he condemns no one absolutely and finally except for
   unbelief--that is, for the willful rejection of the gospel salvation.
   [1526] This fundamental doctrine of God's universal love and abundant
   provision for the salvation of all mankind should be put into a
   confession of faith rather than the doctrine of reprobation or
   preterition, which is, to say the least, as objectionable in such a
   document as the damning clauses in the Athanasian Creed.

   The exegetical and theological adjustment of this whole subject of
   predestination, and of the unequal distribution and partial withholding
   of the favors of Providence and the means of grace in this world, is
   involved in insurmountable difficulties, and the contemplation of it
   should, make us cautious and charitable. A few general remarks may tend
   to set the problem in its true light, and to open the prospect of at
   least a partial solution. [1527]

   It must in fairness be admitted that the Calvinistic system only traces
   undeniable facts to their first ante-mundane cause in the inscrutable
   counsel of God. It draws the legitimate logical conclusions from such
   anthropological and eschatological premises as are acknowledged by all
   other orthodox Churches, Greek, Roman, Lutheran, and Reformed. They all
   teach the condemnation of the human race in consequence of Adam's fall,
   and confine the opportunity and possibility of salvation from sin and
   perdition to this present life, [1528] And yet every body must admit
   that the vast majority of mankind, no worse by nature than the rest,
   and without personal guilt, are born and grow up in heathen darkness,
   out of the reach of the means of grace, and are thus, as far as we
   know, actually 'passed by' in this world. No orthodox system can
   logically reconcile this stubborn and awful fact with the universal
   love and impartial justice of God.

   The only solution seems to lie either in the Quaker doctrine of
   universal light--that is, an uncovenanted offer of salvation to all men
   in this earthly life--or in an extension of the period of saving grace
   beyond death till the final judgment for those (and for those only) who
   never had an opportunity in this world to accept or to reject the
   gospel salvation. But the former view implies a depreciation of the
   visible Church, the ministry of the gospel, and the sacraments; the
   latter would require a liberal reconstruction of the traditional
   doctrine of the middle state such as no orthodox Church, in the absence
   of clear Scripture light on this mysterious subject, and in view of
   probable abuse, would be willing to admit in its confessional teaching,
   even if theological exegesis should be able to produce a better
   agreement than now exists on certain disputed passages of the New
   Testament and the doctrine of Hades.

   So far, then, the only difference is that, while the other orthodox
   Confessions conceal the real difficulty, Calvinism reveals it, and thus
   brings it nearer to a solution.

   Moreover, the Calvinistic system, by detaching election from the
   absolute necessity of water-baptism, has a positive advantage over the
   Augustinian system, and is really more liberal. All the creeds which
   teach baptismal regeneration as an indispensable prerequisite of
   salvation virtually exclude the overwhelming majority of mankind--whole
   nations, with untold millions of infants dying in infancy--from the
   kingdom of heaven, whether they expressly say so or not. The Christian
   heart of the great African father shrunk from this fearful but
   inevitable conclusion of his logical head, and tried to mitigate it by
   making a distinction between positive damnation or actual suffering,
   and negative damnation or absence of bliss, and by subjecting
   unbaptized infants to the latter only. And this is the doctrine of
   Roman Catholic divines. The Calvinistic theory affords a more
   substantial relief, and allows, after the precedent of Zwingli and
   Bullinger, and in accordance with the analogy of Melchisedek, Job, and
   other exceptional cases of true piety under the Jewish dispensation, an
   indefinite extension of God's saving grace beyond the limits of the
   visible Church and the ordinary means of grace. It leaves room for the
   charitable hope of the salvation of all infants dying in infancy, and
   of those adults who, without an historical knowledge of Christ, live up
   to the light of nature and Providence, and die with a humble and
   penitent longing after salvation--that is, in a frame of mind like that
   of Cornelius when he sent for St. Peter. [1529] This was, indeed, not
   the professed Calvinism of Calvin and Beza, nor of the divines of Dort
   and Westminster, nor of the older divines of New England; [1530] but it
   is consistent with the Calvinistic scheme, which never presumed to fix
   the limits of divine election, and with a liberal interpretation of the
   Westminster Confession, which expressly acknowledges that elect infants
   and elect adults are regenerated and saved by Christ without being
   outwardly called by the gospel. [1531]

   Modern Calvinism, at least in America, has decidedly taken a liberal
   view of this subject, and freely admits at least the probability of the
   universal salvation of infants, and hence the salvation of the greater
   part of the human race. Christianity can not be a failure in any
   sense--it must be a triumphant success, which is guaranteed from
   eternity by the infinite goodness and wisdom of God. [1532]

   But whatever may be the theoretical solution of this deep and dark
   mystery, there is a practical platform on which evangelical Christians
   can agree, namely, that all men who are and will be saved are saved by
   the free grace of God, without any merit of their own (faith itself
   being a gift of grace); while all who are lost are lost by their own
   guilt. It has often been said that pious Calvinists preach like
   Arminians, and pious Arminians pray like Calvinists. In this both may
   be inconsistent, but it is a happy and a useful inconsistency. The
   Calvinistic Whitefield was as zealous and successful in converting
   souls as the Arminian Wesley, and Wesley was as fervent and prevailing
   in prayer as Whitefield. They parted in this world, but they have long
   since been reconciled in heaven, where they see the whole truth face to
   face. We must work as if all depended on our efforts, and we must pray
   as if all depended on God. This is the holy paradox of St. Paul, who
   exhorts the Philippians to work out their own salvation with fear and
   trembling, for the very reason that it is God who worketh effectively
   in them both to will and to work of his own good pleasure. God's work
   in us and for us is the basis and encouragement of our work in him and
   for him.

   INTOLERANCE. [1533]

   The principle of intolerance has been charged upon Chaps. XXIII. (Of
   the Civil Magistrate), XXX. (Of Church Censures), XXXI. (Of Synods and
   Councils), and the last clause of Ch. XX. (Of Christian Liberty, viz.,
   the words 'and by the power of the civil magistrate'). The same charge
   applies to a few words in the 109th question of the Larger Catechism,
   where 'tolerating a false religion' is included among the sins
   forbidden in the Second Commandment with reference to some passages of
   the Old Testament and of the Book of Revelation (ii. 2, 16, 20; xvii.
   16, 17).

   There is no doubt that these passages assume a professedly Christian
   government, or the union of Church and State as it had come to be
   established in all Christian countries since the days of Constantine,
   and as it was acknowledged at that time by Protestants as well as Roman
   Catholics. [1534] It is on this ground that the Confession claims for
   the civil magistrate (of whatever form of government) the right and
   duty not only legally to protect, but also to support the Christian
   Church, and to prohibit or punish heresy, idolatry, and blasphemy.

   The power to coerce and punish implies the principle of intolerance and
   the right of persecution in some form or other, though this right may
   never be exercised. For just as far as a civil government is identified
   with a particular Church, an offense against that Church becomes an
   offense against the State, and subject to its penal code. All acts of
   uniformity in religion are necessarily exclusive, and must prohibit the
   public manifestations of dissent, whatever may be the private thoughts
   and sentiments, which no human government can reach.

   It is a fact, moreover, that the Westminster Assembly was called for
   the purpose of legislating for the faith, government, and worship of
   three kingdoms, and that by adopting the Solemn League and Covenant it
   was pledged for the extirpation of popery and prelacy and all heresy.
   [1535]

   The few Independents demanded a limited toleration, and were backed by
   Cromwell and his army, which was full of Independents, Baptists,
   Antinomians, Socinians, New Lights, Familists, Millenarians, and other
   'proud, self-conceited, hot-headed sectaries' (as Baxter calls them).
   All these sectaries, who sprung up during the great religious
   excitement of the age, but mostly subsided soon afterwards, were of
   course tolerationists in their own interest. But for this very reason
   the prevailing sentiment in the Assembly was stoutly opposed to
   toleration, as the great Diana of the Independents and supposed mother
   and nurse of all sorts of heresies and blasphemies threatening the
   overthrow of religion and society. [1536] The Scottish delegation was a
   unit on the subject, and Baillie wrote a Dissuasive from the Errors of
   the Time (1645) against toleration, and attacked it in his Letters.
   [1537] Innumerable pamphlets were published on both sides. The
   advocates of toleration were defeated, and could only exact from the
   Assembly the important declaration that God alone is Lord of the
   conscience.

   And yet, if we judge the Westminster standards from the stand point of
   the seventeenth century, and compare them with similar documents, they
   must be pronounced moderate.

   1. They go no further on the subject of intolerance than the Belgic
   Confession, [1538] the Gallican Confession, [1539] the English
   Articles, [1540] and the Irish Articles. [1541] They teach less than is
   implied in the Anglican doctrine of the royal supremacy, which puts the
   religion of a whole nation in the hands of the temporal sovereign, and
   which was employed for the severest measures against all dissenters,
   Roman Catholic and Protestant.

   2. The Presbyterians, during the fifteen years of their domination,
   [1542] used their power very moderately, with the exception of a
   wholesale ejectment of a large number of prelatists from office
   (allowing them, however, one fifth of their income). This was a folly
   and a crime (viewed from our standpoint), but not nearly as cruel as
   the hanging and burning, the imprisonment, torture, and mutilation so
   freely exercised against themselves and other non-conformists before
   1640 and after 1661. During the disgraceful period of the Restoration,
   which they unwisely brought about without exacting any pledges from the
   faithless Stuart, they suffered for their loyalty to the Westminster
   standards as much hardship and displayed as much heroism, both in
   England and Scotland, as any Church or sect in Christendom ever did.
   [1543]

   3. The Confession expresses for the first time among the confessions of
   faith, whether consistently or not, the true principle of religious
   liberty, which was made the basis of the Act of Toleration, in the
   noble sentiment of Ch. XX. 2: 'God alone is Lord of the conscience
   (James iv. 12; Rom. xiv. 4), and hath left it free from the doctrines
   and commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his Word,
   or beside it, in matters of faith or worship (Acts iv. 19; v. 29; 1
   Cor. vii. 23; Matt. xxiii. 8-10; xxv. 9; 2 Cor. 1, 24). So that to
   believe such doctrines or to obey such commandments out of conscience
   is to betray true liberty of conscience; and the requiring of an
   implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy
   liberty of conscience, and reason also' (Isa. viii. 20; Acts xvii. 11).

   4. The objectionable clauses in the Confession and Larger Catechism
   have been mildly interpreted and so modified by the Presbyterian
   Churches in Europe as to disclaim persecuting sentiments. [1544] The
   Presbyterian Churches in the United States have taken the more frank
   and effective course of an entire reconstruction of those chapters, so
   as to make them expressly teach the principle of religious freedom, and
   claim no favor from the civil magistrate but that protection which it
   owes to the lives, liberties, and constitutional rights of all its
   citizens. [1545]

   GENERAL REMARKS ON THE PROGRESS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

   The question in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was about
   toleration and persecution. But religious freedom requires much more,
   and is now regarded as one of the fundamental and most precious rights
   of men, which must be sacredly protected in its public exercise by the
   civil government, within the limits of order, peace, and public morals.
   This liberty is the final result and gain of ages of intolerance and
   persecution.

   The history of religious persecution is the darkest chapter in Church
   history--we may call it the devil's chapter--and the darkest part in it
   is the persecution of Christians by Christians. It is, however,
   relieved by the counter-manifestation of the heroic virtues of
   Christian martyrdom and the slow but steady progress of liberty through
   streams of martyr blood.

   All Christian Churches, except a few denominations of recent date which
   never had a chance, have more or less persecuted when in power, and
   must plead guilty. The difference is only one of degree. The
   Episcopalians were less intolerant than the Roman Catholics, the
   Presbyterians less intolerant than the Episcopalians, the Independents
   less intolerant (in theory) than the Presbyterians. But they were all
   intolerant. Even the Independents of Old England, with the great
   Cromwell and the great Milton as their leaders, excluded Romanists,
   Prelatists (i.e., Episcopalians), and Unitarians from their programme
   of toleration, [1546] and, strange to say, when in power in New
   England, they expelled Baptists and hanged Quakers on the virgin soil
   of Massachusetts before and after the Westminster Assembly. On the
   other hand, however, there is not a Christian Church or sect that has
   not complained of intolerance and injustice under persecution, and that
   has not furnished some bold advocates of toleration and freedom, from
   Tertullian and Lactantius down to Roger Williams and William Penn. This
   is the redeeming feature in this fearful picture, and must not be
   overlooked in making up a just estimate.

   It is therefore the greatest possible injustice to charge the
   persecutions to Christianity, which breathes the very opposite spirit
   of forbearance, forgiveness, love, and liberality; which teaches us to
   suffer wrong rather than to inflict wrong; and which, by restoring the
   divine image in man, and lifting him up to the sphere of spiritual
   freedom, is really the pure source of all that is truly valuable in our
   modern ideas of civil and religious liberty. Whatever may be said of
   the severity of the Mosaic legislation, which assumes the union of the
   civil and ecclesiastical power, Christ and the Apostles, both by
   precept and example, strictly prohibit the use of carnal means for the
   promotion of the kingdom of heaven, which is spiritual in its origin,
   character, and aim. The reminiscence of this spirit lingered in the
   Church through the darkest ages in the maxim Ecclesia non sitit
   sanguinem.

   It is also wrong to derive intolerance from the strength and intensity
   of religious conviction--although this undoubtedly may come in as an
   additional stimulus--and to trace toleration to skepticism and
   unbelief. [1547] For who had stronger convictions than St. Paul? His
   Jewish conviction or pharisaical fanaticism made him a bitter
   persecutor, but his Christian conviction inspired his seraphic
   description of love (1 Cor. xiii.) and strengthened him for martyrdom.
   On the other hand, the Deist philosopher, Hobbes, by giving the civil
   power an absolute right to determine the religion of a nation, taught
   the extreme doctrine of persecution; and the reign of terror in France
   proves that infidelity may be as fanatical and intolerant as the
   strongest faith, and may instigate the most horrible of persecutions.

   Intolerance is rooted in the selfishness and ambition of human nature
   and in the spirit of sectarian exclusiveness, which assumes that we and
   the sect to which we belong have the monopoly of truth and orthodoxy,
   and that all who dissent from us must be in error. Persecution follows
   as a legitimate consequence of this selfishness and bigotry wherever
   the intolerant party has the power to persecute.

   The Roman Church, wherever she controls the civil government, can not
   consistently tolerate, much less legally recognize, any form of worship
   besides her own, because she identifies herself with the infallible
   Church of Christ, out of which there is no salvation, and regards all
   who dissent from her as damnable schismatics and heretics. [1548]
   Protestants, who began with the assertion of private judgment against
   the authority of Rome, and complained bitterly of her persecuting
   spirit, are inconsistent and more inexcusable if they refuse the same
   right to others and persecute them for its exercise. For a long time,
   however, Protestantism clung to the traditional idea of uniformity in
   religion, and this was the source of untold suffering, especially in
   England, until it became manifest beyond a doubt that doctrinal and
   ceremonial uniformity was an impossibility in a nation of intelligent
   freemen. The Toleration Act of May 24, 1689, for the relief of
   Dissenters, marks the transition. Since that time religious persecution
   by the civil power has ceased in the Anglo-Saxon race, and the
   principle of religious liberty has gradually become a settled
   conviction of the most advanced sections of the Christian world.

   For this change of public sentiment the chief merit is due to the
   English Non-conformists, who in the school of persecution became
   advocates of toleration, especially to the Baptists and Quakers, who
   made religious liberty (within the limits of the golden rule) an
   article of their creed, so that they could not consistently persecute
   even if they should ever have a chance to do so. [1549] It was next
   promoted by the eloquent advocacy of toleration in the writings of
   Chillingworth, [1550] Jeremy Taylor, [1551] and other Anglican divines
   of the latitudinarian school; further, by the mingling of creeds and
   sects in the same country where persecution failed of its aim; and,
   lastly, by the skeptical philosophy and the religious indifferentism of
   the eighteenth century, which, however, has repeatedly shown itself
   most intolerant of all forms of positive belief, and can therefore be
   no more trusted than the bigotry of superstition. Religious freedom is
   best guaranteed by an enlightened Christian civilization, a liberal
   culture, a large-hearted Christian charity, a comprehensive view of
   truth, a free social intercourse of various denominations, and a wise
   separation of civil and ecclesiastical government.

   During the last stages of the age of persecution Providence began to
   prepare in the colonies of North America the widest field and the
   proper social basis for the full exercise of religious liberty and
   equality by bringing together under one government the persecuted of
   all nations and sects, so that the enjoyment of the liberty of each
   depends upon and is guaranteed by the recognition and protection of the
   liberty of all the rest.

   [1516] In the debate on predestination Dr. Reynolds wisely said, 'Let
   us not put disputes and scholastic things into a confession of
   faith.'--Minutes, p. 151.

   [1517] Principal Baillie wrote (Jan. 26, 1647, Letters, Vol. III. p.
   2): 'The Confession is much cried up by all, even many of our greatest
   opposites, as the best confession yet extant.' The moderate and
   judicious Richard Baxter esteemed the Westminster Confession and
   Catechisms the best books in his library next to the Bible, and says
   (in his Confession, ch. i. § 5): 'I have perused oft the Confession of
   the Assembly, and verily judge it the most excellent, for fullness and
   exactness, that I have ever read from any Church; and though the truths
   therein, being of several degrees of evidence and necessity, I do not
   hold them with equal clearness, confidence, or certainty; and though
   some few points in it are beyond my reach, yet I have observed nothing
   in it contrary to my judgment, if I may be allowed those expositions
   following.' The saintly Archbishop Leighton, though he left the Church
   for which his father had suffered such cruelties from Laud, taught the
   doctrine of the Confession to the end of his life.

   [1518] J. B. Marsden (The History of the Later Puritans, 1852, pp. 80,
   81), while judging severely of the Assembly on account of its treatment
   of Episcopacy, thinks the Westminster Confession inferior to none of
   the Protestant Confessions except in originality, and adds: 'It does
   not, however, detract from the real merit of these later divines, that
   they availed themselves of the labors of the Reformation; or that
   Bullinger and Calvin, especially the latter, should have left them
   little to accomplish, except in the way of arrangement and compression.
   The Westminster Confession should be read by those who can not
   encounter the more ponderous volumes of the great masters from which it
   is derived. It is in many respects an admirable summary of Christian
   faith and practice. None can lay it down with a mean opinion of the
   Westminster divines. The style is pure and good, the proofs are
   selected with admirable skill, the arguments are always clear, the
   subjects well distributed, and sufficiently comprehensive to form at
   least the outline of a perfect system of divinity.' It is but just to
   add that Marsden goes on to censure what he calls its 'rigid
   ultra-Calvinism, which has always repelled the great majority of
   English Christians.' Dean Stanley, who has no theological sympathy with
   the Westminster Confession, says that of all Protestant Confessions 'it
   far more nearly approaches the full proportions of a theological
   treatise, and exhibits far more depth of theological insight, than any
   other,' He adds, however, that 'it reflects also far more than any
   other the minute hair-splitting and straw-dividing distinctions which
   had reached their height in the Puritanical theology of that age, and
   which in sermons ran into the sixteenthly, seventeenthly sections that
   so exercised the soul of Dugald Dalgetty as he waited for the
   conclusion of the discourse in the chapel of Inverary Castle. It
   accordingly furnished the food for which the somewhat hard and logical
   intellect of Scotland had a special appetite' (Lectures on the History
   of the Church of Scotland, delivered in 1872, Am. ed. p. 88). In
   another place Stanley calls the Westminster formulary 'that famous
   Confession of Faith which, alone within these islands, was imposed by
   law on the whole kingdom; and which, alone of all Protestant
   Confessions, still, in spite of its sternness and narrowness, retains a
   hold on the minds of its adherents, to which its fervor and its logical
   coherence in some measure entitle it' (Memorials of Westminster Abbey,
   p. 513).

   [1519] Dr. Currey, for many years editor of the 'Methodist Advocate,'
   of New York, in an editorial on Creeds (Aug. 6, 1874), calls 'the
   Westminster Confession of Faith the ablest, clearest, and most
   comprehensive system of Christian doctrine ever framed. That venerable
   instrument purposely embodies in its unity the dogma of absolute
   predestination, which necessarily becomes the corner-stone of the
   edifice, so giving it shape and character. But, despite that capital
   fault, it is not only a wonderful monument of the intellectual
   greatness of its framers, but a comprehensive embodiment of nearly all
   the precious truths of the gospel. If set forth without ecclesiastical
   authority, for the edification of believers, it would, despite its
   faults, be a work of inestimable worth; but enforced by such authority,
   and imposed upon men's consciences, it is a yoke and a chain and a cage
   of iron. And yet this is the accepted formula of faith of nearly all
   the Calvinistic Churches of America. Even the Congregationalists in
   National Council, at Plymouth Rock, only a few years ago, reaffirmed
   their acceptance of it.'

   [1520] Dr. Wallis, the mathematician, who is said to be the chief
   author of the sharp definitions of the Shorter Catechism (see p. 786),
   wrote towards the close of the seventeenth century a pamphlet in
   defense of the doctrine of the Trinity against rising Unitarianism,
   where he compares the Almighty to a cube with its length, breadth, and
   height infinitely extended, longum, latum, profundum, which are the
   equal sides of one substance, and fairly resemble the Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost. He finds nothing mysterious in this doctrine. 'It is,' he
   says, 'but this, that there be three somewhats, which are but one God,
   and these somewhats are called Persons.' Quoted by Stoughton, The
   Church of the Revolution, p. 213.

   [1521] This is the American formula of subscription required from
   ministers. On the Scottish subscription formulas, see Innes, pp. 66,
   81, 84, 103, 453.

   [1523] Westm. Conf. Ch. VIII. § 8. This last section is the best in the
   whole chapter.

   [1524] Ch. III. 7. This seventh section is the one dark spot in the
   Confession, and mars its beauty and usefulness. Comp. Larger Catechism,
   Quest. 13: 'God hath passed by and foreordained the rest to dishonor
   and wrath to be for their own sin inflicted, to the praise of the glory
   of his justice.' The Shorter Catechism (Quest. 7) wisely omits the
   negative part of predestination.

   [1525] Matt. xi. 25 ('Thou hast hid these things,' etc.); Rom. ix. 17,
   18, 21, 22; 2 Tim. ii. 20; Jude 4; 1 Pet. ii. 8--all quoted in the
   Confession. The ninth chapter of Romans is the exegetical bulwark of
   the doctrine of reprobation; but it must be explained in connection
   with the tenth chapter, which brings out the unbelief of the creature
   as the cause, and with the eleventh chapter, which opens the prospect
   of a glorious solution of the problem in the conversion of the fullness
   of the Gentiles and the people of Israel, and ends with the grand
   declaration that 'God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might
   have mercy upon all.' We have no more right to limit the all in the
   second clause than in the first. Comp. the parallelism in Rom. v. 12

   [1527] Comp. our remarks, pp. 451 sqq.

   [1528] The Roman Catholic doctrine, of purgatory is no exception, for
   this is confined to members of the Catholic Church who were converted
   in this life but need further purification before they can enter
   heaven. The Roman creed is more pronounced than the Greek and the
   Protestant on the impossibility of salvation outside of the visible
   Church on earth.

   [1529] See above, p. 378.

   [1530] The Rev. Michael Wigglesworth, of Malden, Mass., a graduate and
   tutor of Harvard College (d. 1705), published a popular poem, The Day
   of Doom (1662; 6th ed. 1715; reprinted as a curiosity by the Amer. News
   Company, New York, 1867), in which God reasons on the judgment-day with
   reprobate infants, who 'from the womb unto the tomb were straightway
   carried,' about the justice of their eternal damnation; and in
   consideration of their lesser guilt, assigns them (like St. Augustine)
   'the easiest room in hell!'

   [1531] Ch. X. 3: 'Elect infants dying in infancy are regenerated and
   saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when and where and how
   he pleaseth. So are all other elect persons who are incapable of being
   outwardly called by the ministry of the Word.' The Confession nowhere
   speaks of reprobate infants, and the existence of such is not
   necessarily implied by way of distinction, although it probably was in
   the minds of the framers as their private opinion, which they wisely
   withheld from the Confession. I think the interpretation of Dr. A. A.
   Hodge, of Allegheny, in his Commentary on this section (p. 240), is
   fairly admissible: 'The Confession affirms what is certainly revealed,
   and leaves that which revelation has not decided to remain without the
   suggestion of a positive opinion upon one side or the other.'. He
   agrees, as to the salvation of all infants dying in infancy, with his
   father, who asserts that 'he never saw a Calvinistic theologian who
   held the doctrine of infant damnation in any sense' (System. Theol.,
   Vol. III. p. 605).

   [1532] Dr. Hodge, of Princeton, is of the opinion, which would be
   preposterous in the Augustinian and Roman Catholic system, that the
   number of those who are ultimately lost is 'very inconsiderable as
   compared with the whole number of the saved.' This is the closing
   sentence of his System. Theol., Vol. III. p. 879. That the number of
   the saved will far exceed the number of the lost may be fairly inferred
   from the pollo mallon of Paul (Rom. v. 15, 17); but this inference can
   not well be harmonized with the declaration of our Lord, Matt. vii. 14,
   that but few enter the strait gate, unless we assume the universal
   salvation of infants, and look forward to great progress of the gospel
   in the future.

   [1533] On the subject of Toleration and Persecution, with special
   reference to England, the reader may profitably consult a series of
   Tracts on Liberty of Conscience and Persecution, 1614-1661, edited by
   Edward B. Underhill for the Hansard Knollys Society, London, 1846; W.
   E. H. Lecky, History of Rationalism in Europe. (4th edition, London,
   1870; New York edition, 1875, in 2 vols.), ch. iv.; Masson, Life of
   Milton, Vol. III. pp. 87 sqq., 383 sqq.; Stoughton, The Church of the
   Revolution (London, 1874), ch. iv. pp. 114 sqq.; and Marshall's book
   quoted on p. 754.

   [1534] The first dissenting voices came from Anabaptists and Socinians,
   and from Castellio, who had nothing to gain and every thing to lose
   from the existing alliance of government and religion.

   [1535] And yet, in the face of this fact and the whole history of the
   seventeenth century, Dr. Hetherington (in his Introduction to Shaw's
   Exposition of the Confession of Faith, pp. xxviii.) broadly denies any
   taint of intolerance in the Confession.

   [1536] Thomas Edwards, a zealous Presbyterian minister at London,
   published in 1645 a treatise of 60 pages, dedicated to Parliament,
   under the title, Gangræna; or, a Catalogue and Discovery of many of the
   Errors, Heresies, Blasphemies, and Pernicious Practices of the
   Sectaries of this Time, in which he collects no less than one hundred
   and seventy-six miscellaneous 'errors, heresies, and blasphemies,' and
   enumerates sixteen heretical sects--namely: 1, Independents; 2,
   Brownists; 3, Millenaries; 4, Antinomians; 5, Anabaptists; 6,
   Arminians; 7, Libertines; 8, Familists; 9, Enthusiasts; 10, Seekers:
   11, Perfectists: 12, Socinians; 13, Arians; 14, Antitrinitarians; 15,
   Antiscripturists; 16, Skeptics. 'The industrious writer,' says Neal,
   'might have enlarged his catalogue with Papists, Prelatists, Deists,
   Ranters, Behemenists, etc., etc., or, if he had pleased, a less number
   might have served his turn, for very few of these sectaries were
   collected into societies; but his business was to blacken the
   adversaries of Presbyterian uniformity, that the Parliament might crush
   them by sanguinary methods.' See an account of this book in Neal, Part
   III. ch. vii. (Vol. II. p. 37), and Masson, Vol. III. pp. 143 sqq.

   [1537] Innes (Law of Creeds, pp. 243 and 244) says: 'Toleration was
   long unknown in the law, as in the history, of Scotland. The intense
   sentiment of national unity was strongly against it. The nation was
   one, and the Church became one. The Church claimed to be the Church of
   Christ in the realm, exclusively and of divine right. . . . The
   Scottish commissioners went to the Westminster Assembly to work out the
   "covenanted uniformity in religion," and the new doctrine of the
   "toleration of sects" which met them there they most earnestly
   resisted.

   [1538] Art. 36. See Vol. III. p. 432.

   [1539] Art. 39. See Vol. III. p. 372.

   [1540] Art. 37. See Vol. III. p. 512.

   [1541] No. 70. See Vol. III. p. 540.

   [1542] We exempt the five years of Cromwell's Protectorate (1653-1658),
   during which the Independents were in the ascendency.

   [1543] A recent able writer, who has no sympathy whatever with the
   faith of Presbyterians, thus describes their persecutions under the
   Stuarts: 'In Scotland, during almost the whole period that the Stuarts
   were on the throne of England, a persecution rivaling in atrocity
   almost any on record was directed by the English government, at the
   instigation of the Scotch bishops, and with the approbation of the
   English Church, against all who repudiated episcopacy. If a conventicle
   was held in a house, the preacher was liable to be put to death. If it
   was held in the open air, both minister and people incurred the same
   fate. The Presbyterians were hunted like criminals over the mountains;
   their ears were torn from the roots; they were branded with hot irons;
   their fingers were wrenched asunder by the thumbkins; the bones of
   their legs were shattered in the boots; women were scourged publicly
   through the streets; multitudes were transported to the Barbadoes; an
   infuriated soldiery was let loose upon them, and encouraged to exercise
   all their ingenuity in torturing them.' (Lecky, l.c. Vol. II. p. 48,
   Amer. ed.)

   [1544] The Established Church of Scotland, the Original Secession
   Church, the English Presbyterian Church, and the Irish Presbyterian
   Church adhere to the 'whole doctrine' of the Westminster Confession,
   with a slight qualification of Ch. XXXI. 2. The Reformed Presbyterian
   Church does the same, but declares in its Testimony that it is 'not
   pledged to defend every sentiment or expression,' and asserts that 'to
   employ civil coercion of any kind for the purpose of inducing men to
   renounce an erroneous creed, or to espouse and profess a sound
   Scriptural one, is incompatible with the nature of true religion, and
   must ever prove ineffectual in practice.' The United Presbyterian
   Church introduces into its Formula of subscription this clause: 'It
   being understood that you are not required to approve of any thing in
   these documents which teaches, or is supposed to teach, compulsory or
   persecuting and intolerant, principles in religion.' The Free Church of
   Scotland meets the difficulty by a questionable exegesis, declaring (in
   an 'Act anent Questions and Formula,' June 1, 1846): ' The General
   Assembly, in passing this Act, think it right to declare that, while
   the Church firmly maintains the same Scriptural principles as to the
   duties of nations and their rulers in reference to true religion and
   the Church of Christ, for which she has hitherto contended, she
   disclaims intolerant or persecuting principles, and does not regard her
   Confession of Faith, or any portion thereof, when fairly interpreted,
   as favoring intolerance or persecution, or consider that her
   office-bearers, by subscribing it, profess any principles inconsistent
   with liberty of conscience and the right of private judgment.' See
   Innes, The Law of Creeds, pp. 453, 461, 463.

   [1545] See next section.

   [1546] Milton, the independent of Independents and the boldest as well
   as most eloquent champion of civil and religious liberty in the
   seventeenth century, was unwilling to tolerate Romanists, because he
   regarded them as idolaters and as enemies of freedom. See his
   Areopagitica, of which Lecky (Vol. II. p. 80) says that it is as
   glorious a monument of the genius of Milton as his Paradise Lost, and
   that it 'probably represents the very highest point that English
   eloquence has attained.'

   [1547] This is the theory of Lecky.

   [1548] The limited toleration in some Roman Catholic countries exists
   in spite of Romanism, and the liberal opinions and Christian feelings
   of individual Catholics have no influence on the system, which is the
   same as ever, as may be inferred from the papal Syllabus of 1864, and
   from the recent papal protest against even the minimum of religious
   toleration in Spain (1876). In Protestant countries the Roman Church
   claims as much liberty as she can get, and advocates toleration in her
   own interest, but would deny it to others as soon as she attained to
   power.

   [1549] See the 'Fourteenth Proposition' of Barclay, adopted by the
   Quakers: 'Since God hath assumed to himself the power and dominion of
   the conscience, who alone can rightly instruct and govern it, therefore
   it is not lawful for any whatsoever, by virtue of any authority or
   principality they bear in the government of this world, to force the
   consciences of others; and therefore all killing, banishing, fining,
   imprisoning, and other such things, which men are afflicted with, for
   the alone exercise of their conscience, or difference in worship or
   opinion, proceedeth from the spirit of Cain, the murderer, and is
   contrary to the truth; provided always that no man, under the pretense
   of conscience, prejudice his neighbor in his life or estate, or do any
   thing destructive to, or inconsistent with, human society; in which
   case the law is for the transgressor, and justice to be administered
   upon all, without respect of persons.' This was published in 1675.
   Bossuet, therefore, was imperfectly informed when at the close of the
   seventeenth century (1688) he mentioned the Anabaptists and Socinians
   as the only Christians who did not admit the power of the civil sword
   'dans les matières de la religion et de la conscience' (Hist. des
   Variations, LIV. X. 56).

   [1550] The Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation, 1637 (or
   1638; dedicated in a most humble preface to King Charles I.; 3d ed.
   1664; 10th ed. 1742; reprinted in the first two vols. of the Oxford ed.
   of Chillingworth's Works, 1838, in 3 vols.). This book is a vindication
   of Protestantism and of the author's return to it, and proclaims that
   the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, is the religion
   of Protestants, and that no Church of one denomination is infallible.
   At Chillingworth's burial, in Jan., 1644, Dr. Cheynell, who had shown
   him great kindness during his sickness, flung this book into the grave,
   with the words, 'Get thee gone, thou cursed book; go rot with thy
   author.' Chillingworth, however, had no idea of civil liberty, and
   wrote as an extreme royalist on the Unlawfulness of Resisting the
   Lawful Prince, although most Impious, Tyrannical, and Idolatrous.

   [1551] Liberty of Prophesying, written in exile (1647), and
   unfortunately retracted in part after the Restoration by the author
   himself, who declared it to have been a ruse de guerre. Coleridge
   regards this weakness as almost the only stain on Taylor's character.

   § 98. The Westminster Standards in America.

   With the Puritan emigration from England and the Presbyterian
   emigration from Scotland and the North of Ireland, the Westminster
   standards were planted on the virgin soil of America long before the
   Declaration of Independence. The most popular is the Shorter Catechism,
   which has undergone no change except a very slight one among the
   Cumberland Presbyterians. [1552]

   THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES OF NEW ENGLAND.

   The Confession of Faith was first adopted 'for substance of doctrine,'
   but without the principles of Presbyterian discipline, by the
   Congregational Synod of Cambridge, in the Colony of Massachusetts, A.D.
   1648, one year after its issue in England; then, in the Savoy
   recension, by the Synod of Boston, Mass., May 12, 1680; and again, in
   the same form, by the Congregational churches of Connecticut at a Synod
   of Saybrook, Sept. 9, 1708.

   The Smaller Catechism was formerly used as a school-book in New
   England, but has been thrust into the background by the modern
   prejudice against catechisms and by a flood of more entertaining but
   less solid Sunday-school literature.

   THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES.

   The various Presbyterian bodies of English and Scotch descent used at
   first all the Westminster standards without alteration. The Presbytery
   of Philadelphia, the oldest in America, was organized in 1706, the
   Synod of Philadelphia in 1717, and the Synod of New York in 1743. The
   Synod of Philadelphia, Sept. 19, 1729, adopted the Confession with a
   liberal construction, in these words:

   'Although the Synod do not claim or pretend to any authority of
   imposing our faith upon other men's consciences, but do profess our
   just dissatisfaction with and abhorrence of such impositions, and do
   utterly disclaim all legislative power and authority in the Church,
   being willing to receive one another as Christ has received us to the
   glory of God, and admit to fellowship in sacred ordinances all such as
   we have grounds to believe Christ will at last admit to the kingdom of
   heaven: yet we are undoubtedly obliged to take care that the faith once
   delivered to the saints be kept pure and uncorrupt among us, and so
   handed down to our posterity.

   'And [we] do therefore agree that all the ministers of this Synod, or
   that shall hereafter be admitted to this Synod, shall declare their
   agreement in and approbation of the Confession of Faith, with the
   Larger and Shorter Catechisms of the Assembly of Divines at
   Westminster, as being, in all the essential and necessary articles,
   good forms of sound words and systems of Christian doctrine, and do
   also adopt the said Confession and Catechisms as the confession of our
   faith.

   'And we do also agree that all the Presbyteries within our bounds shall
   always take care not to admit any candidate of the ministry into the
   exercise of the sacred function but what declares his agreement in
   opinion with all the essential and necessary articles of said
   Confession, either by subscribing the said Confession of Faith and
   Catechisms, or by a verbal declaration of his assent thereto, as such
   minister or candidate shall think best. And in case any minister of
   this Synod, or any candidate for the ministry, shall have any scruple
   with respect to any article or articles of said Confession or
   Catechisms, he shall, at the time of his making said declaration,
   declare his sentiments to the Presbytery or Synod, who shall,
   notwithstanding, admit him to the exercise of the ministry within our
   bounds, and to ministerial communion, if the Synod or Presbytery shall
   judge his scruple or mistake to be only about articles not essential
   and necessary in doctrine, worship, or government. But if the Synod or
   Presbytery shall judge such ministers or candidates erroneous in
   essential and necessary articles of faith, the Synod or Presbytery
   shall declare them incapable of communion with them. And the Synod do
   solemnly agree that none of us will traduce or use any opprobrious
   terms of those that differ from us in these extra-essential and
   not-necessary points of doctrine, but treat them with the same
   friendship, kindness, and brotherly love as if they had not differed
   from us in such sentiments.' [1553]

   In the afternoon session the scruples about adopting these standards
   were solved, and the Synod unanimously declared that they do not
   receive 'some clauses in the twentieth and twenty-third chapters in any
   such sense as to suppose the civil magistrate hath a controlling power
   over Synods with respect to the exercise of their ministerial
   authority, or power to persecute any for their religion, or in any
   sense contrary to the Protestant succession to the throne of Great
   Britain.'

   This supplementary action foreshadows the changes which were afterwards
   made.

   When the Synods of Philadelphia and New York united in one body at
   Philadelphia, May 29, 1758, they adopted, as the first article of the
   plan of union, the following:

   'Both Synods having always approved and received the Westminster
   Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechisms, as an orthodox
   and excellent system of Christian doctrine, founded on the Word of God,
   we do still receive the same as the confession of out faith; and also
   adhere to the plan of worship, government, and discipline contained in
   the Westminster Directory, strictly enjoining it on all our members and
   probationers for the ministry, that they preach and teach according to
   the form of sound words in said Confession and Catechisms, and avoid
   and oppose all errors contrary thereto.' [1554]

   THE AMERICAN REVISION.

   After the Revolutionary War the united Synod of Philadelphia and New
   York, which met at Philadelphia, May 28, 1787, appointed a committee to
   prepare an alteration in the Confession of Faith, Ch. XX. (closing
   paragraph), Ch. XXIII., 3, and Ch. XXXI., 1, 2, in consequence of the
   new relation of Church and State. [1555]

   The changes proposed were adopted by the joint Synod at a subsequent
   meeting in Philadelphia, May 28, 1788, in the following action:

   'The Synod having fully considered the draught of the form of
   government and discipline, did, on a review of the whole, and hereby do
   ratify and adopt the same, as now altered and amended, as the
   Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, and order the same
   to be considered and strictly observed as the rule of their proceedings
   by all the inferior judicatories belonging to the body. And they order
   that a correct copy be printed, and that the Westminster Confession of
   faith, as now altered, be printed in full along with it, as making a
   part of the Constitution.

   'Resolved, That the true intent and meaning of the above ratification
   by the Synod is, that the Form of Government and Discipline, and the
   Confession of Faith, as now ratified, is to continue to be our
   constitution and the confession of our faith and practice unalterable,
   unless two thirds of the Presbyteries under the care of the General
   Assembly shall propose alterations or amendments, and such alterations
   or amendments shall be agreed to and enacted by the General Assembly.'
   [1556]

   On the day following (May 29) the Synod 'took into consideration the
   Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms, and having made a small
   amendment of the Larger, did approve, and do hereby approve and ratify
   the said Catechisms, as now agreed on, as the Catechisms of the
   Presbyterian Church in the said United States.' At the same time it was
   ordered that all these standards, as altered and adapted to the wants
   of the American churches, be printed and bound up in one volume. [1557]

   The changes consist in the omission of those sentences which imply the
   union of Church and State, or the principle of ecclesiastical
   establishments, making it the duty of the civil magistrate not only to
   protect, but also to support religion, and giving to the magistrate
   power to call and ratify ecclesiastical synods and councils, and to
   punish heretics. Instead of this, the American revision confines the
   duty of the civil magistrate to the legal protection of religion in its
   public exercise, without distinction of Christian creeds or
   organizations. It thus professes the principle of religious liberty and
   equality of all denominations before the law. This principle has been
   faithfully and consistently adhered to by the large body of the
   Presbyterian Church in America, and has become the common law of the
   land. To facilitate the comparison we present the respective sections
   in parallel columns:

   Original Text. American Text.
   Ch. XXIII. 3.--Of the Civil Magistrate. Ch. XXIII. 3.--Of the Civil
   Magistrate.
   The civil magistrate, may not assume to himself the administration of
   the Word and Sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven; [1558] yet he hath authority, and it is his duty to take order,
   that unity and peace be preserved in the Church, that the truth of God
   be kept pure and entire, that all blasphemies and heresies be
   suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in worship and discipline
   prevented or reformed; and all the ordinances of God duly settled,
   administered, Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the
   administration of the Word and Sacraments; [1559] or the power of the
   keys of the kingdom of heaven; [1560] or, in the least, interfere in
   matters of faith. [1561] Yet, as nursing fathers, it is the duty of
   civil magistrates to protect the Church of our common Lord, without
   giving the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest,
   in such a manner that all ecclesiastical persons whatever shall enjoy
   the full, free, and unquestioned liberty


   and observed. [1562] For the better effecting whereof he hath power to
   call synods, to be present at them, and to provide that whatsoever is
   transacted in them be according to the mind of God. [1563] of
   discharging every part of their sacred functions without violence or
   danger. [1564] And as Jesus Christ hath appointed a regular government
   and discipline in his Church, no law of any commonwealth should
   interfere with, let, or hinder the due exercise thereof among the
   voluntary members of any denomination of Christians, according to their
   own profession and belief. [1565] It is the duty of civil magistrates
   to protect the person and good name of all their people, in such an
   effectual manner as that no person be suffered, either upon pretense of
   religion or infidelity, to offer any indignity, violence, abuse, or
   injury to any other person whatsoever; and to take order that all
   religious and ecclesiastical assemblies be held without molestation or
   disturbance. [1566]
   Ch. XXXI.--Of Synods and Councils. Ch. XXXI.--Of Synods and Councils.
   For the better government and further edification of the Church, there
   ought to be such assemblies as are commonly called synods or councils.
   [1567] For the better government and further edification of the Church,
   there ought to be such assemblies as are commonly called synods or
   councils. [1568] And it belongeth to the overseers and other rulers of
   the particular churches, by virtue of their office, and the power which
   Christ hath given them for edification, and not for destruction, to
   appoint such assemblies; and to convene together in them, as often as
   they shall judge it expedient for the good of the Church. [1569]
   II. As magistrates may lawfully call a synod of ministers and other fit
   persons to consult and advise with about matters of religion: [1570]
   so, if magistrates be open enemies to the Church, the ministers of
   Christ, of themselves, by virtue of their office; or they, with other
   fit persons, upon delegation from their churches, may meet together in
   such assemblies. [1571]


   In Ch. XX., § 4, the last sentence, 'and by the power of the civil
   magistrate,' was omitted, so as to read, 'they [the offenders] may
   lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of
   the Church.'

   The only change made in the Larger Catechism was the striking out of
   the words 'tolerating a false religion,' among the sins forbidden in
   the Second Commandment (Quest. 109).

   The example set by the Presbyterian Church in the United States was
   afterwards (1801) followed by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the
   revision of the political sections of the Thirty-nine Articles of
   Religion.

   PRESBYTERIAN REUNION. [1572]

   The division of the Presbyterian Church into Old School and New School,
   which took place at Philadelphia, June 8, 1837, arose chiefly from
   contentions in consequence of the Plan of Union formed in 1801 between
   the General Assembly and the Congregational Association of Connecticut,
   and involved two different constructions of the doctrinal
   standards--the one more strict and conservative, the other more liberal
   and progressive--but did not affect the organic law of the Church.
   [1573] The Old School, it is true, charged the New School with sixteen
   Pelagian and Arminian errors, which had their origin in recent
   developments of New England theology; but the New School met the charge
   with the 'Auburn Declaration' (Aug. 1837), which denied those errors
   and adopted sixteen 'true doctrines' in essential harmony with the
   Calvinistic anthropology and soteriology. This Declaration must be
   regarded as expressing the belief of the New-School body at that time,
   whatever the views of individual members may have been. [1574]

   In the preparatory steps towards a reunion of these two bodies after a
   separation of thirty-two years, the question of the doctrinal basis
   took a prominent part. It was proposed that 'in the United Church the
   Westminster Confession of Faith shall be received and adopted as
   containing the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures.' It is
   characteristic of the excellent temper and spirit of concession which
   prevailed on both sides, that at the 'Presbyterian National Union
   Convention,' held in November, 1867, at Philadelphia, Dr. Henry B.
   Smith, of the Union Theological Seminary, New York, a prominent leader
   of the New School, proposed a defining clause, to satisfy the demands
   of Old School orthodoxy; [1575] while the Rev. Dr. Gurley, pastor of an
   Old-School church in Washington City, proposed an additional clause to
   guarantee the New School liberty of interpretation. [1576] The
   amendments were received unanimously, with great joy and gratitude.

   But after further consideration it was found best to drop both these
   amendments, and when the reunion was consummated by the two assemblies
   at Pittsburgh, Pa., Nov. 10, 1869, the following article was
   unanimously adopted:

   'The reunion shall be effected on the doctrinal and ecclesiastical
   basis of our common Standards; the Scriptures of the Old and New
   Testaments shall be acknowledged to be the inspired Word of God, and
   the only infallible rule of faith and practice; the Confession of Faith
   shall continue to be sincerely received and adopted, as containing the
   system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures; and the government
   and discipline of the Presbyterian Church in the United States shall be
   approved as containing the principles and rules of our polity.'

   Thus the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, which had
   been unfortunately separated by a permissive decree of God, was happily
   and, we trust, forever reunited by an efficient and gracious decree of
   God. [1577]

   OTHER PRESBYTERIAN CHURCHES IN THE UNITED STATES.

   In addition to this large Presbyterian Church, there are in the United
   States a number of smaller ones having distinctively a Scottish origin.
   Of these and of their relation to the Westminster standards the Rev. G.
   D. Mathews, of New York, from his own familiar acquaintance with the
   Presbyterian Churches in Scotland and the United States, kindly
   furnishes for this work the following account:

   'Among the emigrants into this country in the last century were many
   who had been connected with the Associate Church of Scotland. The
   fathers of that Church, the Erskines, objected not so much to the
   constitution of the Established Church as to its administration,
   especially in reference to patronage and to Church discipline. In 1753
   the American Associate Church was organized as a Presbytery subordinate
   to the Antiburgher Synod of Scotland, equalling if not surpassing the
   mother Church in its rigid adherence to the doctrinal system of the
   Westminster standards. Its zeal for these, indeed, served to deepen its
   opposition to the Scottish Establishment as a Church that had become
   unfaithful to its religious profession.

   'In 1774 a Reformed Presbyterian Presbytery was constituted in America
   by followers of Cargill, Cameron, and Renwick. These held that the
   Church of Scotland had marred its standing as a true Church of Christ
   by entering into union with an immoral government--the government of
   Great Britain being of this character because not based on Scriptural
   principles. Of this latter position the proof was alleged to lie in its
   disregard, as shown by the national acceptance of Episcopacy at the
   Restoration in 1660, and again at the Revolution in 1688, of that
   Solemn League and Covenant which had been sworn to in 1643, a Covenant
   whose engagements were affirmed to be binding on the people of the
   British Empire until fulfilled. An additional proof lay in the absence
   from its constitution of any acknowledgment of God as the Author of its
   existence and the source of its authority, of Jesus Christ as its
   Ruler, and of the Bible as the supreme law of its conduct.

   'Notwithstanding some actual differences, the force of circumstances
   brought these Churches together, so that in 1782 they became united
   under the name of the Associate Reformed Church--minorities on both
   sides refusing to enter the union, and thus perpetuating their
   respective Churches. In 1799 the Associate Reformed Church issued an
   edition of the Westminster Confession containing the following changes
   from the original documents:

   Chap. XX. 4.-- . . . faith, worship, conversation, (insert) or the
   order which Christ hath established in his Church, they may be lawfully
   called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of the Church;
   and in proportion as their erroneous opinions or practices, either in
   their own nature or in the manner of publishing or maintaining them,
   are destructive to the external peace of the Church and of civil
   society, they may also be proceeded against by the power of the civil
   magistrate.

   Chap. XXII. 3.-- . . . the keys of the kingdom of heaven. (Add) Yet, as
   the gospel revelation lays indispensable obligations upon all classes
   of people who are favored with it, magistrates, as such, are bound to
   execute their respective offices in a subserviency thereto,
   administering government on Christian principles, and ruling in the
   fear of God, according to the directions of his Word; as those who
   shall give an account to the Lord Jesus, whom God hath appointed to be
   the Judge of the world.

   Hence magistrates, as such, in a Christian country are bound to promote
   the Christian religion, is the most valuable interest of their
   subjects, by all such means as are not inconsistent with civil rights,
   and do not imply an interference with the policy of the Church, which
   is the free and independent kingdom of the Redeemer, nor an assumption
   of dominion over conscience.

   Chap. XXXI. 2.--(Substitute.) The ministers of Christ themselves, and
   by virtue of their office; or they with other fit persons, upon
   delegation from their churches, have the exclusive right to appoint,
   adjourn, or dissolve such synods or councils; though in extraordinary
   cases it may be proper for magistrates to desire the calling of a synod
   of ministers and other fit persons, to consult and advise with about
   matters of religion; and in such cases it is the duly of churches to
   comply with their desire.

   'In the Larger Catechism, under the things forbidden by the Second
   Commandment, the word authorizing was substituted for "tolerating a
   false religion."

   'In 1858 the Associate Church, which had by this time grown
   considerably, joined with the Associate Reformed Church, when the name
   United Presbyterian Church was assumed and the Westminster Confession
   again altered. The edition used by this Church differs from the
   original in the following passages:

   Chap. XX. 4.-- . . . hath established in the Church, they (add) ought
   to be called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of the
   Church, if they belong to her communion, and thus be amenable to her
   own spiritual authority. And as the civil magistrate is the minister of
   God for good to the virtuous and a revenger to execute wrath upon him
   that doeth evil, he is therefore bound to suppress individuals and
   combinations, whatever may be their avowed objects, whether political
   or religious, whose principles and practices, openly propagated and
   maintained, are calculated to subvert the foundations of properly
   constituted society.

   Chap. XXIII. 3.-- . . . kingdom of heaven, (add) or in the least
   interfere to regulate matter's of faith and worship. As nursing
   fathers, magistrates are bound to administer their government according
   to the revealed principles of Christianity, and to improve the
   opportunities which their high station and extensive influence afford
   in promoting the Christian religion as their own most valuable interest
   and the good of the people demand, by all such means as do not imply
   any infringement of the inherent rights of the Church, or any
   assumption of dominion over the consciences of men. They ought not to
   punish any as heretics or schismatics. No authoritative judgment
   concerning matters of religion is competent to them, as their authority
   extends only to the external works or practices of their subjects as
   citizens, and not as Christians. It is their duty to protect the Church
   in such a manner that all ecclesiastical persons shall enjoy the free,
   full, and unquestioned liberty of discharging every part of their
   sacred functions without violence or danger. They should enact no law
   which would in any way interfere with or hinder the due exercise of
   government and discipline established by Jesus Christ in his Church. It
   is their duty also to protect the person, good name, estate, natural
   and civil rights of all their subjects in such a way that no person be
   suffered, upon any pretense, to violate them; and to take order that
   all religious and ecclesiastical assemblies be held without molestation
   or disturbance. God alone being Lord of the conscience, the civil
   magistrate may not compel any under his civil authority to worship God
   contrary to the dictates of their own consciences; yet it is competent
   in him to restrain such opinions and to punish such practices as tend
   to subvert the foundations of civil society and violate the common
   rights of men.

   Chap. XXXI. 2.--(Substitute.) We declare that as the Church of Jesus
   Christ is a kingdom distinct from and independent of the state, having
   a government, laws, office-bearers, and all spiritual power peculiar to
   herself for her own edification; so it belongs exclusively to the
   ministers of Christ, together with other fit persons, upon delegation
   from their churches, by virtue of their office and the intrinsic power
   committed unto them, to appoint their own assemblies, and to convene
   together in them as often as they should judge it expedient for the
   good of the Church.

   'In the question of the Larger Catechism, changed in 1799, the original
   word tolerating was restored.

   'At no period has the Associate Church, which still exists, altered the
   language of the Confession. It has refrained from doing this, "judging
   it to be improper for one ecclesiastical body to alter any deed of
   another, making it rather express their own views than those of the
   body by whom it was originally framed, for hereby the sentiments of one
   body may be unfairly palmed upon another." Any obscurity or error in
   the Confession should be remedied by the emitting of a Testimony, in
   which there could be given a full and accurate statement of the
   particular truth in question. In 1784, therefore, the Associate Church
   issued such a Testimony, in which (Articles 15-19), speaking of the
   civil magistrate, it affirmed that the magistrate, as such, is no ruler
   in the Church; that he should not grant any privileges to those whom he
   judges professors of the true religion which may hurt others in their
   natural rights; that his whole duty, as a magistrate, respects men, not
   as Christians, but as members of civil society; that any de facto
   government governing orderly is that ordinance of God which must be
   obeyed, and that with any such government Christians may lawfully
   co-operate.

   'The Reformed Presbyterian Church has also retained the Westminster
   Confession unaltered. Adhering to its teaching on the Civil Magistrate,
   as this was received by the Church of Scotland in the Adopting Act of
   1647, it issued in 1806 a Testimony, in which it declared that civil
   government is a natural institution, but that, to be a lawful one, so
   that a Christian man may take part in it, God must be acknowledged in
   its constitution as the fountain of all power and authority, and that
   Christian rulers, appointed to office according to a righteous civil
   constitution, have authority from God to rule, in subserviency to the
   kingdom of Christ. The absence from the American national constitution
   of any such acknowledgment renders that covenant unscriptural and
   immoral, and so precludes Christian men from becoming identified with
   its administration. Another reason for this political dissent is the
   doctrine of the binding obligation of the Scottish Covenants.

   'A difference of opinion that had gradually risen within this Church as
   to the extent of this precluding led to the formation, in 1833, of the
   Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church holding the extremest view of
   political dissent, and of the General Synod of the same Church,
   permitting its members to exercise the political franchise.

   'As regards the doctrinal articles of the Confession, all these
   Churches are Calvino Calviniores.'

   illustrating the doctrines of the Confession, which do not impair the
   integrity of the Reformed or Calvinistic system, are to be freely
   allowed in the United Church, as they have hitherto been allowed in the
   separate Churches.'

   HISTORICAL.

   The Cumberland Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, so
   called from its birth-place, the 'Cumberland Country' in Kentucky and
   Tennessee, took its rise in an extensive revival of religion which
   began in the southwestern part of Kentucky in 1797, and reached its
   height in 1800 and 1801, among a population mostly of Scotch-Irish
   descent. Methodist ministers took part in it. This revival called for a
   larger number of ministerial laborers than could be supplied in the
   regular way by the few Presbyterian institutions of learning then
   existing. Hence the Presbytery of Cumberland ('at the recommendation of
   the Rev. Mr. Rice, the oldest Presbyterian minister then residing in
   Kentucky') licensed and ordained a number of pious men without a
   liberal education, and allowed them, in subscribing the Westminster
   Confession, to express their dissent from what they called the doctrine
   of 'fatality,' i.e., the doctrine of absolute decrees. The Synod of
   Kentucky demanded a re-examination of these ministers and candidates;
   this being refused, it dissolved the Cumberland Presbytery in 1806. The
   General Assembly confirmed the action, but ultimately recognized the
   Cumberland Presbyterians as an independent organization, and entered
   into terms of correspondence with them as with other evangelical
   denominations. [1578]

   The dissenters organized an independent 'Cumberland Presbytery,'
   February 4, 1810, consisting of four regularly ordained ministers, six
   licentiates, and seven candidates. The presbytery grew into the
   Cumberland Synod in 1818, and this adopted a Confession, Catechism, and
   Form of Church Government. The Confession was the work of a committee
   of which the Rev. Finis Ewing was the leading spirit. The Cumberland
   Synod was divided into three (1828), and a General Assembly was formed,
   which held its first session in May, 1829. This Body subjected the
   Confession of Faith to a final revision. 'In so doing, the Synod and
   General Assembly only exercised an undeniable right, allowed by the God
   of the Bible and secured by the civil constitution; and discharged what
   they conceived to be a duty to the Church and the world. . . . Let the
   work be tried neither by tradition nor the fathers, but by the holy
   Scriptures.' [1579]

   The Cumberland Church has since spread rapidly, and extends now from
   Western Pennsylvania to Texas and California. It furnishes the proof
   that people may be good Presbyterians without being Calvinists.

   THE CUMBERLAND PRESBYTERIAN CONFESSION.

   The Cumberland Presbyterians differ from the regular Presbyterians in
   two points--the education for the ministry and the doctrine of
   predestination. They adopt and use the Westminster Confession in full,
   with the American amendments in Chs. XXIII. and XXXI., and slight
   verbal changes, but they depart from it in rejecting the unconditional
   election and reprobation as taught in Ch. III. [1580] They retain,
   however, substantially Ch. XVII. on perseverance, although perseverance
   presupposes unconditional election, and is inconsistent with
   conditional election. The Cumberland Confession teaches on the one hand
   conditional election and unlimited atonement, and on the other the
   final perseverance of the saints. It is an eclectic compromise between
   Calvinism and Arminianism; it is half Calvinistic and half Arminian,
   and makes no attempt to harmonize these antagonistic elements.
   'Cumberland Presbyterians,' says one of their writers, 'believe as
   firmly as Arminians do that salvation, in all cases, is conditional.
   But they believe that every genuine saint will comply with the
   conditions; and thus salvation becomes certain to saints. It is
   uncertain to sinners because it is doubtful whether they will comply
   with the conditions; but certain to saints because it is certain that
   they will comply with the conditions--"My sheep hear my voice, and they
   follow me."' [1581] The same writer answers the usual objections to the
   doctrine of perseverance (the fall of Adam and the angels, of Solomon
   and Peter, the warnings and exhortations of Scripture, the alleged
   inconsistency of the doctrine with free agency and the duty of
   watchfulness), and urges nine reasons against the Arminian view of
   falling from grace. [1582]

   Another departure connected with the former is the affirmation of the
   salvation of all infants dying in infancy. The old Confession says. Ch.
   X. 3: 'Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by
   Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when and where and how he
   pleaseth.' This seems naturally (though not necessarily) to imply the
   existence of reprobate infants who are not saved. To avoid this
   interpretation, the Cumberland Confession substitutes all for elect,
   and thus positively teaches universal infant salvation. In this point
   it has anticipated what seems now to be the general sentiment among
   American Presbyterians, who harmonize it with the Westminster
   Confession either by interpreting that all infants dying in infancy are
   elect, or that it confines itself to state as an article of faith what
   is clearly warranted in Scripture, and leaves the rest to private
   opinion.

   The Shorter Catechism of the Assembly has been changed by the
   Cumberland Presbyterians in Question 7 as follows:

   westminster catechism. cumberland catechism.
   What are the decrees of God? What are the decrees of God?
   The decrees of God are his eternal purpose according to the counsel of
   his will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever
   comes to pass. The decrees of God are his purpose according to the
   counsel of his own will, whereby he hath foreordained to bring to pass
   what shall be for his own glory: sin not being for God's glory,
   therefore he hath not decreed it.


   In Question 20 the words 'God did provide salvation for all mankind'
   are substituted for 'God, having elected some to everlasting life,' and
   the phraseology is otherwise changed. In Question 31, for the phrase
   'What is effectual calling?' is substituted 'What is the work of the
   Spirit?'

   [Note.--In 1906, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was "reunited" with
   the Presbyterian Church, U. S. A., accepting the Westminster Confession
   as revised, 1902. A dissenting element retained the old name and has
   perpetuated the organization with a membership, 1929, of 64,081. At the
   time of the union, 1906, the Cumberland Church reported 200,000 members
   in 114 presbyteries.--Ed.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1578] In 1825 the General Assembly declared that the ministrations of
   the Cumberland Presbyterians 'are to be viewed in the same light with
   those of other denominations' (Baird's Collection, p. 646). In 1849 the
   General Assembly of the New School entered into correspondence with
   them, and passed this resolution: 'The General Assembly of each Church
   shall appoint and receive delegates from the General Assembly of the
   other Church, who shall be possessed of all the powers and privileges
   of other members of such Assemblies, except that of voting' (Minutes,
   p. 184; Moore, p. 448). The Rev. Dr. Alexander J. Baird appeared as a
   delegate of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church before the United
   General Assembly in Baltimore, 1873, and was cordially received
   (Minutes of the General Assembly of the Presbyt. Church for 1873, p.
   485). In the following year the General Assembly at St. Louis sent a
   salutation to the Cumberland Presbyterian Assembly then in session at
   Springfield, Mo., with the words: 'Serving the same Lord, we are one in
   him. May he dwell in us.' To this the Cumberland Assembly responded in
   the same fraternal spirit (Minutes for 1874, pp. 18 and 20). A
   committee of conference on union was also appointed, but was discharged
   by the General Assembly of 1875 (Minutes, p. 480).

EIGHTH CHAPTER.

  MODERN PROTESTANT CREEDS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 100. General Survey.

   With the Westminster standards the creed-making period of the Reformed
   Churches was brought to a close. Calvinism found in them its clearest
   and fullest exposition. The Helvetic Consensus Formula (1675) was only
   a weak symbolical after-birth, called forth by the Saumur controversies
   on the extent of divine election and the inspiration of Hebrew
   vowel-points. The creative power of Lutheran symbolism had exhausted
   itself much earlier in the Formula of Concord (1577), and was followed
   by a period of scholastic analysis and demonstration of the Lutheran
   system as embodied in its authoritative confessions. The prevailing
   tendency in these Churches is to greater confessional freedom and
   catholic expansion rather than sectarian contraction. While the Roman
   Catholic Church in our age has narrowed its creed by adding two new
   dogmas of wide range and import, and has doomed to silence every
   dissent from the infallible decisions of the Vatican, like a machine
   that is worked by a single motive force, and makes resistance
   impossible, the Protestant Churches would simplify and liberalize their
   elaborate standards of former days rather than increase their bulk and
   tighten their authority. The spirit of the age refuses to be bound by
   rigorous formulas, and demands greater latitude for private opinion and
   theological science.

   We might therefore close our history of creeds at this point. But
   evangelical Protestantism extends far beyond the boundaries of
   Lutheranism and Calvinism.

   Since the middle of the seventeenth century there arose, mainly from
   the fruitful soil of the Reformed Church in England, first amid much
   persecution, then under the partial protection of the Toleration Act of
   1689, a number of distinct ecclesiastical organizations, which, while
   holding fast to the articles of the oecumenical faith of orthodox
   Christendom, and the evangelical principles of the Protestant
   Reformation, differ on minor points of doctrine, worship, and
   discipline. They have passed through the bloody baptism of persecution
   as much as the older Churches of the Reformation, and by their fruits
   they have fully earned a title to an honorable standing in the family
   of Christian Churches.

   The most important among these modern denominations are the
   Congregationalists, Baptists, and Quakers, who rose in the seventeenth
   century, and the Methodists and Moravians, who date from the middle of
   the eighteenth century. They originated in England, with the exception
   of the Moravians (who are of Bohemian and German descent), and found
   from the start a fruitful and congenial soil in the American colonies,
   which offered an hospitable asylum to all who suffered from religious
   persecution. The Congregationalists had established flourishing
   colonies in Massachusetts and Connecticut before they were even
   tolerated in the mother country. Roger Williams, the patriarch of the
   American Baptists, though of English birth and training, made Rhode
   Island his permanent home. The fathers and founders of the Society of
   Friends--Fox and Penn; of Methodism-- Wesley and Whitefield; of the
   Moravian Church--Zinzendorf, Spangenberg, Nitschmann--visited America
   repeatedly, and with such success that they gave to their denominations
   an Anglo-American stamp. Two of these denominations, the Methodists and
   Baptists, have in the United States during the nineteenth century
   numerically far outgrown the older Protestant Churches, and are full of
   aggressive zeal and energy, both at home and in distant missionary
   fields. [1583]

   On the Continent of Europe these Anglo-American denominations till
   quite recently were little known, and were even persecuted as intruders
   and unchurchly sects. National State Churches will allow the widest
   latitude of theological speculation within the limits of outward
   conformity rather than grant freedom of public worship to dissenting
   organizations, however orthodox. [1584]

   The nineteenth century has given birth in England to the Irvingites and
   Darbyites, and in America to the Cumberland Presbyterians, Reformed
   Episcopalians, and other organizations, which more or less depart from
   the older Protestant confessions, but adhere to the supernatural
   revelation in the Bible and the fundamental articles of general
   orthodoxy. [1585]

   The creeds of these modern Protestant denominations (if we except the
   Savoy Declaration of 1658 and the Baptist Confession of 1688, which
   contain the body of the Westminster Confession) are thin, meagre, and
   indefinite as compared with the older confessions, which grew out of
   the profound theological controversies of the sixteenth century. They
   contain much less theology; they confine themselves to a popular
   statement of the chief articles of faith for practical use, and leave a
   large margin for the exercise of private judgment. In this respect they
   mark a return to the brevity and simplicity of the primitive baptismal
   creeds and rules of faith. The authority of creeds, moreover, is
   lowered, and the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of the Scriptures
   is emphasized.

   In the present age there is, especially in America, a growing tendency
   towards a liberal recognition and a closer approach of the various
   evangelical denominations in the form of a free union and co-operation
   in the common work of the Master, without interfering with the inner
   organization and peculiar mission of each. This union tendency
   manifests itself from different starting-points and in different
   directions, now in the form of voluntary associations (such as Bible
   and Tract Societies, Young Men's Christian Associations, the
   Evangelical Alliance, the German Church Diet), now in the form of
   ecclesiastical confederations (Pan-Anglican Council, Presbyterian
   Alliance, Anglo-Greek Committees, the Bonn Conferences), now in the
   form of organic union (the evangelical Union of Lutherans and Reformed
   Churches in Prussia and other German States, Presbyterian Reunion of
   Old and New School). The same tendency calls forth efforts, feeble as
   yet, to formulate the essential consensus of the creeds of congenial
   sections of Christendom. The old motto, in necessariis unitas, in
   dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas, is struggling to become a
   practical reality; the age of separation and division is passing away,
   and the age of the reunion of divided Christendom is beginning to dawn,
   and to gather the corps of Christ's army, so long engaged in internal
   war, against the common foe Antichrist.

   [1584] Under the disparaging name of sects the Methodists and Baptists,
   and other denominations figure usually in German works on Symbolics
   that recognize only three Churches or Confessions--the Catholic (Greek
   and Roman), the Lutheran, and the Reformed (Calvinistic). The late
   Professor Marheineke, one of the chief writers on Symbolics, after
   explaining to his catechumens of Trinity Parish, in Berlin, that there
   are three Churches in Christendom, asked a pupil, 'To what Church do
   you belong?' and received the answer, 'To Trinity Church.' The science
   of Symbolics, or Comparative Theology, has thus far been almost
   exclusively cultivated in Germany, but should be reconstructed on a
   much more liberal scale in England and America, where all denominations
   meet in daily intercourse and on terms of equal rights.

   [1585] Some of these have already been considered, the Cumberland
   Presbyterians in connection with the Westminster Confession, the
   Reformed Episcopalians in connection with the history of the
   Thirty-nine Articles.

   Congregationalism has its name from the prominence it gives to the
   particular congregation as distinct from the general Church. [1586] It
   aims to establish a congregation of real believers or converts, and it
   declares such a congregation to be independent of outward jurisdiction,
   whether it be that of a king or a bishop or a presbytery. Under the
   first aspect it has several precedents; under the latter aspect it
   forms a new chapter in Church history, or at least it carries the
   protest against foreign jurisdiction a great deal farther than the
   Reformers, who protested against the tyrannical authority of the
   papacy, but recognized some governmental jurisdiction over local
   congregations.

   CONGREGATIONS IN THE APOSTOLIC AGE.

   In the New Testament the word church or congregation [1587] denotes
   sometimes the Church universal, the whole body of Christian believers
   spread throughout the world; [1588] sometimes a particular congregation
   at Jerusalem, Antioch, Corinth, Rome, or any other place. [1589] The
   congregations are related to the Church as members to the body. The
   denominational and sectarian use of the word is foreign to the
   Scriptures, which know of no sect but the sect called Christians.
   [1590] Denominations or Confessions are the growth of history and
   adaptations of Christianity to the differences of race, nationality,
   and psychological constitution; and after fulfilling their mission they
   will, as to their human imperfections and antagonisms, disappear in the
   one kingdom of Christ, which, however, in the beauty of its living
   unity and harmony, will include an endless variety.

   An organized local congregation in the apostolic age was a company of
   saints, [1591] or a self-supporting and self-governing society of
   Christian believers, with their offspring, voluntarily associated for
   purposes of worship, growth in holiness, and the promotion of Christ's
   kingdom. The Apostolic churches were not free from imperfection and
   corruption, but they were separated from the surrounding world of
   unbelievers, and constantly reminded of their high and holy calling.

   THE ANTE-NICENE CHURCHES.

   In the ante-Nicene age a distinction was made between the church of
   believers or communicant members and the church of catechumens or
   hearers who were in course of preparation for membership, but not
   allowed to partake of the communion. [1592] Public worship was
   accordingly divided into the service of the faithful (missa fidelium)
   and the service of the catechumens (missa catechumenorum).

   MIXTURE OF THE CHURCH WITH THE WORLD.

   With the union of Church and State since Constantine the original idea
   of a church of real believers was gradually lost, and became identical
   with a parish which embraced all nominal Christians in a particular
   place or district. Baptism, confirmation, and attendance at communion
   were made obligatory upon all residents, whether converted or not, and
   every citizen was supposed to be a Christian. [1593] The distinction
   between the Church and the world was well-nigh obliterated, and the
   Church at large became a secular empire with an Italian sovereign at
   its head. Hence the complaint of Dante (in Milton's rendering):

   'Ah! Constantine, of how much ill was cause,

   Not thy conversion, but those rich domains

   That the first wealthy Pope received of thee!'

   ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE THE PURITY OF THE CHURCH.

   Monasticism was an attempt in the Catholic Church itself to save the
   purity of the congregation by founding convents and nunneries secluded
   not only from the world, but also from all ties of domestic and social
   life. It drained the Church of many of its best elements, and left the
   mass more corrupt.

   The Bohemian Brethren and the Waldenses introduced strict
   congregational discipline in opposition to the ruling Church.

   The Reformers of the sixteenth century deplored the want of truly
   Christian congregations after the apostolic model, and wished to revive
   them, but Luther and Zwingli gave it up in despair from the want of
   material for congregational self-government (which can never be
   developed without an opportunity and actual experiment).

   Calvin was more in earnest, and astonished the world by founding in
   Geneva a flourishing Christian commonwealth of the strictest
   discipline, such as had not been seen since the age of the Apostles.
   But it was based on a close union of the civil and ecclesiastical
   power, which destroyed the voluntary feature, and ended at last in the
   same confusion of the Church and the world.

   The Anabaptists and Mennonites emphasized the voluntary principle and
   the necessity of discipline, but they injured their cause by fanatical
   excesses.

   The German Pietists of the school of Spener and Francke realized their
   idea of ecclesiolæ in ecclesia, or select congenial circles within the
   outward organization of the promiscuous national Church, from which
   they never separated. Wesley did originally the same thing, but his
   movement resulted in a new denomination.

   The Moravians went farther, and established separate Christian
   colonies, which in the period of rationalism and infidelity were like
   beacon-lights in the surrounding darkness.

   ENGLISH AND AMERICAN CONGREGATIONALISM.

   English and American Congregationalism, or Congregationalism as a
   distinct denomination, arose among the Puritans during the latter part
   of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It was at first identified with the
   name of the Rev. Robert Browne, and called Brownism; but, being an
   unworthy representative and an apostate from his principles, he was
   disowned. [1594] It had other and more worthy pioneers, such as
   Barrowe, Greenwood, Johnson, Ainsworth, Penry, and especially John
   Robinson. [1595] The Independents were, like every new sect, persecuted
   under the reigns of James and Charles I., and obliged to seek shelter
   first in Holland and then in the wilderness of New England.

   But with the opening of the Long Parliament, which promised to
   inaugurate a jubilee to all tender consciences, they began to breathe
   freely, and hastened to return from exile; 'for,' says Fuller, 'only
   England is England indeed, though some parts of Holland may be like
   unto it.' [1596] They had a considerable share in the labors of the
   Westminster Assembly of Divines, especially through Dr. Goodwill and
   Rev. Philip Nye, who are styled the 'patriarchs' of orthodox
   Independency. They became the ruling political and religious power in
   England during the short protectorate of Cromwell, and furnished the
   majority to his ecclesiastical commission, called the Triers. After the
   Restoration they were again persecuted, being held chiefly responsible
   for the execution of King Charles and the overthrow of the monarchy. In
   1689 they acquired toleration, and are now one of the most intelligent,
   active, and influential among the Dissenting bodies in England.

   The classical soil of Congregationalism is New England, where it
   established 'a Church without a bishop and a State without a king.'
   From New England it spread into the far West, to the shores of the
   Pacific Ocean, and exerted a powerful influence upon other Churches.
   Puritan Congregationalism is the father of New England and one of the
   grandfathers of the American Republic, and it need not be ashamed of
   its children. [1597] It lacks a proper appreciation of historical
   Christianity and its claims upon our regard and obedience; but by
   bringing to light the manhood and freedom of the Christian people, and
   the rights and privileges of individual congregations, it marks a real
   progress in the development of Protestantism, and has leavened other
   Protestant denominations in America; for here congregations justly
   claim and exercise a much larger share, and have consequently a much
   deeper interest in the management of their own affairs than in the
   State Churches of Europe. The Congregational system implies, of course,
   the power of self-government and a living faith in Christ, without
   which it would be no government at all. It moreover requires the
   cementing power of fellowship.

   INDEPENDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP.

   Anglo-American Congregationalism has two tap roots, independency and
   fellowship, on the basis of the Puritan or Calvinistic faith. It
   succeeds in the measure of its ability to adjust and harmonize them. It
   is a compromise between pure Independency and Presbyterianism. It must
   die without freedom, and it can not live without authority,
   Independency without fellowship is ecclesiastical atomism; fellowship
   without Independency leads to Presbyterianism or Episcopacy. [1598]

   It starts from the idea of an apostolic congregation as an organized
   brotherhood of converted believers in Christ. This was the common
   ground of the Westminster divines. [1599] But they parted on the
   question of jurisdiction and the relation of the local congregation to
   the Church general. The Independents denied the authority of
   presbyteries and synods, and maintained that each congregation properly
   constituted is directly dependent on Christ, and subject to his law,
   and his law only. The whole power of the keys is vested in these
   individual churches.

   At the same time, however, it is admitted and demanded that there
   should be a free fraternal intercommunion between them, with the rights
   and duties of advice, reproof, and co-operation in every Christian
   work.

   This fellowship manifests itself in the forms of Councils, Associations
   (in Massachusetts), Consociations (in Connecticut), on a larger scale
   in 'the Congregational Union of England and Wales,' and 'the National
   Council of the Congregational Churches in the United States.' It is
   this fellowship which gives Congregationalism the character of a
   denomination among other denominations. But the principle of
   congregational sovereignty is guarded by denying to those general
   meetings any legislative authority, and reducing them simply to
   advisory bodies. [1600]

   There were from the start two tendencies among Congregationalists--the
   extreme Independents or Separatists, of whom the 'Pilgrim Fathers' are
   the noblest representatives, and the more churchly Independents, who
   remained in the English Church, and who established on a Calvinistic
   theocratic basis the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. John Robinson, the
   Moses of American Independency, who accompanied his flock to the deck
   of the Speedwell, but never saw the promised land himself, was a
   separatist from the Church of England, though he disowned Brownism with
   its extravagances. His colony at Plymouth were Separatists. The
   settlers of Boston, Salem, Hartford, and New Haven, on the other hand,
   were simply Nonconformists within the Church of England. Their
   ministers--John Cotton, Richard Mather, Thomas Hooker, John Davenport,
   Samuel Stone, and others--were trained in the English Universities,
   mostly in Cambridge, [1601] and had received Episcopal ordination. They
   rejected the term Independents, and inconsistently relapsed into the
   old notion of uniformity in religion, with an outburst of the dark
   spirit of persecution. But this was only temporary. American
   Congregationalism at present is a compromise between the two
   tendencies, and vacillates between them, leaning sometimes to the one,
   sometimes to the other side.

   CONGREGATIONALISM AND CREEDS.

   The effect of the Congregational polity upon creeds is to weaken the
   authority of general creeds and to strengthen the authority of
   particular creeds. The principle of fellowship requires a general
   creed, but it is reduced to a mere declaration of the common faith
   prevailing among Congregationalists at a given time, instead of a
   binding formula of subscription. The principle of independency calls
   for as many particular creeds as there are congregations. Each
   congregation, being a complete self-governing body, has the right to
   frame its own creed, to change it ad libitum, and to require assent to
   it not only from the minister, but from every applicant for membership.
   Hence there are a great many creeds among American Congregationalists
   which have purely local authority; but they must be in essential
   harmony with the prevailing faith of the body, or the congregations
   professing them forfeit the privileges of fellowship. They must flow
   from the same system of doctrine, as many little streams flow from the
   same fountain.

   In this multiplication of local creeds Congregationalism far outstrips
   the practice of the ante-Nicene age, where we find varying yet
   essentially concordant rules of faith in Jerusalem, Cæsarea, Antioch,
   Aquileja, Carthage, Rome.

   With these local creeds are connected 'covenants' or pledges of members
   to live conformably to the law of God and the faith and discipline of
   the Church. A covenant is the ethical application of the dogmatic
   creed.

   In the theory of creeds and covenants, as on the whole subject of
   Church polity, the Regular or Calvinistic Baptists entirely agree with
   the Congregationalists.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1586] This term is preferable to Independency. In England both terms
   are used synonymously. The American Congregationalists rather disclaim
   the designation Independents, except for a small portion of their
   ancestors, namely, the 'Pilgrim Fathers' of Plymouth. See below.

   [1587] ekklesia, from ekkaleo, to call out, means (like qhl) any public
   assembly, but especially a religious assembly.

   [1588] Matt. xvi. 18; Acts xx. 28; Gal. i. 13; Eph. i. 22, etc.

   [1589] Matt. xviii. 17; Acts v. 11; viii. 3; xv. 41 (in the plural, hai
   ekklesiai); Gal. i. 22; Rom. xvi. 4, 5, etc.

   [1590] Comp. Acts xi. 26; xxvi. 28; 1 Pet. iv. 16. There were parties
   or sects among the Christians at Corinth which assumed apostolic
   designations, but Paul rebuked them (1 Cor. i, 10-13; iii. 3, 4). The
   tribes of Israel may be quoted as a Jewish precedent of the divisions
   in Christendom, but they formed one nation.

   [1591] ekklesiai ton hagion, 1 Cor. xiv. 33.

   [1592] Comp. the modern American distinction between church proper and
   congregation.

   [1593] The Jews--like the 'untaxed Indians' in the United States--were
   excluded from the rights of citizenship, and as unmercifully persecuted
   during the Middle Ages as the Christians were persecuted by the Jews in
   the apostolic age.

   [1594] Robert Browne, a clergyman of the Established Church and a
   restless agitator, urged a reformation 'without tarrying for any,' a
   complete separation from the national Church as an anti-Christian
   institution, and the formation of independent Christian societies.
   After suffering persecution and exile (he was imprisoned about thirty
   times), he returned to the Ministry of the national Church, where he
   led an idle and dissolute life till his death, in 1630, at the age of
   eighty years.

   [1595] See on these early witnesses and martyrs of Independency,
   Hanbury (Vol. I. chaps. ii.-xxvi.), Brook (Vol. III.), and Punchard
   (Vol. III.).

   [1596] Vol. VI. p. 280.

   [1597] I beg leave to quote from an essay which I wrote and published
   in the midst of our civil war (1863), when New England was most
   unpopular, the following tribute to its influence upon American
   history: 'It seems superfluous, even in these days of sectional
   prejudice, party animosity, and slander, to say one word in praise of
   New England. Facts and institutions always speak best for themselves.
   We might say with Daniel Webster, giving his famous eulogy on
   Massachusetts a more general application to her five sister States:
   "There they stand: look at them, and judge for yourselves. There is
   their history--the world knows it by heart: the past at least is
   secure." The rapid rise and progress of that rocky and barren country
   called New England is one of the marvels of modern history. In the
   short period of two centuries and a half it has attained the height of
   modern civilization which it required other countries more than a
   thousand years to reach. Naturally the poorest part of the United
   States, it has become the intellectual garden, the busy workshop, and
   the thinking brain of this vast republic. In general wealth and
   prosperity, in energy and enterprise, in love of freedom and respect
   for law, in the diffusion of intelligence and education, in letters and
   arts, in virtue and religion, in every essential feature of national
   power and greatness, the people of the six New England States, and more
   particularly of Massachusetts, need not fear a comparison with the most
   favored nation on the globe. But the power and influence of New
   England, owing to the enterprising and restless character of its
   population, extends far beyond its own limits, and is almost
   omnipresent in the United States. The twenty thousand Puritans who
   emigrated from England within the course of twenty years, from 1620 to
   1640, and received but few accessions until the modern flood of mixed
   European immigration set in, have grown into a race of several
   millions, diffused themselves more or less into every State of the
   Union, and take a leading part in the organization and development of
   every new State of the great West to the shores of the Pacific. Their
   principles have acted like leaven upon American society; their
   influence reaches into all the ramifications of our commerce,
   manufactures, politics, literature, and religion; there is hardly a
   Protestant Church or Sabbath-school in the land, from Boston to San
   Francisco, which does not feel, directly or indirectly, positively or
   negatively, the intellectual and moral power that constantly emanates
   from the classical soil of Puritan Christianity.'

   [1598] Dr. Emmons, one of the leaders of New England Congregationalism,
   is credited with this memorable dictum: 'Associationism leads to
   Consociationism; Consociationism leads to Presbyterianism;
   Presbyterianism leads to Episcopacy; Episcopacy leads to Roman
   Catholicism; and Roman Catholicism is an ultimate fact' (Prof. Park, in
   Memoir of Emmons, p. 163). But there would be equal force in the
   opposite reasoning from Independency to anarchy, and from anarchy to
   dissolution. Independents have a right to protest against tyranny,
   whether exercised by bishops or presbyters ('priests writ large'); but
   there are Lord Brethren as well as Lord Bishops, and the tyranny of a
   congregation over a minister, or of a majority over a minority, is as
   bad as any other kind of tyranny.

   [1599] 'The Form of Presbyterial Church Government agreed upon by the
   Assembly of Divines at Westminster,' and adopted by the General
   Assembly of Scotland in 1645, thus defines a local Church: 'Particular
   churches in the primitive times were made up of visible saints, viz.,
   such as, being of age, professed faith in Christ and obedience unto
   Christ, according to the rules of faith and life taught by Christ and
   his apostles, and of their children.' The Form of Government ratified
   by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States
   in May, 1821, gives this definition (Ch. II. 4): 'A particular church
   consists of a number of professing Christians, with their offspring,
   voluntarily associated together for divine worship and godly living,
   agreeably to the Holy Scriptures, and submitting to a certain form of
   government.'

   [1600] The most serious conflict between the principles of Independency
   and Fellowship in recent times has grown out of the unhappy Beecher
   trial, which has shaken American Congregationalism to the very base.
   See Proceedings of the two Councils held in Brooklyn in 1874 and 1876,
   which represent both sides of the question (Dr. Storrs's and Mr.
   Beecher's), though presided over by the same Nestor of American
   Congregationalism (Dr. Leonard Bacon).

   [1601] Masson (Life of Milton, Vol. II. p. 563) says that of seventeen
   noted ministers who emigrated to New England, fourteen were bred in
   Cambridge, and only three (Davenport, Mather, and Williams) at Oxford.
   R. Williams was probably likewise a Cambridge graduate. It was
   therefore natural that the first college in New England should be
   called after Cambridge.

   THE SAVOY DECLARATION. A.D. 1658.

   We now proceed to the general creeds or declarations of faith which
   have been approved by the Congregational Churches in England and
   America. They agree substantially with the Westminster Confession, or
   the Calvinistic system of doctrine, but differ from Presbyterianism by
   rejecting the legislative and judicial authority of presbyteries and
   synods, and by maintaining the independence of the local churches. In
   the course of time the rigor of old Calvinism has relaxed, both in
   England and America. 'New England theology,' as it is called, attempts
   to find a via media between Calvinism and Arminianism in anthropology
   and soteriology. But the old standards still remain unrepealed.

   The first and fundamental Congregational confession of faith and
   platform of polity is the Savoy Declaration, so called from the place
   where it was composed and adopted. [1602]

   The position of the Congregationalists during the short period of their
   ascendency under Cromwell's Protectorate (1653-1658) was rather
   anomalous. They were by no means so strongly committed to the voluntary
   principle and against a national Church as to refuse appointments in
   the universities and parish churches, with the tithes and other
   emoluments connected therewith. Dr. Goodwin was President of Magdalen
   College, Cambridge; Dr. Owen, Dean of Christ Church and Vice-Chancellor
   at Oxford; Philip Nye, Rector of St. Bartholomew's, London; Joseph
   Caryl, Rector of St. Mary Magnus; William Greenhill, incumbent of the
   village of Stepney; William Bridge, town lecturer at Yarmouth; John
   Howe, parish minister at Torrington, and afterwards court chaplain to
   Cromwell until his death. [1603] Cromwell himself had no idea of
   disconnecting the government from religion. Christianity was fully
   recognized under his rule as part and parcel of the law of the land. It
   accompanied with its solemn worship the ordinary business of
   Parliament. Public fasts were frequently appointed by the Protector (to
   which the Presbyterians objected as an Erastian intrusion), and lasted
   usually from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon. The
   rights of patronage were not disturbed; the tithes and other provisions
   for the support of the clergy and the repair of churches were
   continued. A commission of Triers, or judicial examiners, one fourth of
   whom were laymen, was appointed to test the fitness of clerical
   applicants and to remove unworthy incumbents, and Church boards of
   gentry and clergy were set up in every county for the supervision of
   ecclesiastical affairs. The Triers took the place of the late
   Westminster Assembly in its administrative work, but were less
   numerous, and included Independents, Presbyterians, and Baptists. Dr.
   Owen, Goodwin, and Manton belonged to them, besides others of less
   wisdom and charity. They were subject to a certain Erastian control by
   the Protector and his Council of State, but left to decide each case
   according to their best judgment, without imposing any creed or canon
   or statute. The plan seems to have worked well, and furnished the
   country, as Baxter says, who was no friend of Cromwell, with 'able,
   serious preachers, who lived a godly life, of what tolerable opinion
   soever they were.' Cromwell's Protectorate was too short to develop a
   full system of ecclesiastical polity. It was a government of
   experiments in accommodation to existing circumstances. Upon the whole,
   it was more tolerant than any previous reign, but only to Puritanism
   and such Protestant sects as recognized the Scriptures and the
   fundamentals of the Christian faith; while it was intolerant to
   Romanists, Socinians, and Episcopal royalists, who endangered his
   government. In his foreign policy Cromwell was the boldest protector of
   Protestantism and religious liberty that England has ever produced.
   [1604]

   Under these favorable circumstances, and in view of the successful
   establishment of an exclusively Congregational commonwealth by their
   transatlantic brethren, the Independents might think of repeating in a
   milder form the experiment of the Westminster Assembly to secure at
   least a certain degree of religious uniformity in England, with a
   limited amount of toleration to orthodox dissenters. Their great
   protector did not seem to favor such a scheme, but shortly before his
   death he reluctantly gave his consent to 'the humble petition and
   advice' of influential members of Parliament to issue a confession of
   faith for the whole kingdom, yet 'without compelling the people thereto
   by penalties,' and to extend liberty to all Christian professions,
   except 'popery or prelacy,' or such as 'publish horrid blasphemies or
   practice or hold forth licentiousness or profaneness under the
   profession of Christ.' A notice from the clerk of the Council of State
   summoned the Congregational churches, in and near London, to a meeting
   in the Savoy, but it was not held till twenty-six days after Cromwell's
   death. About two hundred delegates from one hundred and twenty
   congregations attended the Conference, which lasted from Sept. 29 till
   Oct. 12, 1658. They agreed unanimously upon the Confession and Order of
   Discipline. It was regarded by them, in the language of the Preface,
   'as a great and special work of the Holy Ghost that so numerous a
   company of ministers and other principal brethren should so readily,
   speedily, and jointly give up themselves unto such a whole body of
   truths that are after godliness.'

   The Savoy Declaration is the work of a committee, consisting of Drs.
   Goodwill, Owen, Nye, Bridge, Caryl, and Greenhill, who had been members
   of the Westminster Assembly, with the exception of Dr. Owen. It
   contains a lengthy Preface (fourteen pages), the Westminster Confession
   of Faith with sundry changes (twenty-two pages), and a Platform of
   Church Polity (five pages).

   1. The Preface is prolix and indifferently written, but deserves notice
   for inaugurating a more liberal view of the authority of creeds and the
   toleration of other creeds. The chief ideas are these: To confess our
   faith is an indispensable duty we owe to God as much as prayer. Public
   confessions are a means of expressing the common faith, but ought not
   to be enforced. 'Whatever is of force or constraint in matters of this
   nature causes them to degenerate from the name and nature of
   Confessions, and turns them into Exactions and Impositions of Faith.'
   With this we should acknowledge 'the great principle that among all
   Christian States and Churches there ought to be vouchsafed a
   forbearance and mutual indulgence unto saints of all persuasions that
   keep unto and hold fast the necessary foundations of faith and
   holiness, in all other matters extra-fundamental, whether of faith or
   order.'

   This was a considerable step beyond the prevailing notion of
   uniformity, although it falls far short of the modern theory of
   religious liberty. The Preface goes on to guard itself against the
   charge of indifference or carelessness.

   2. The Declaration of Faith. This is a slight modification of the
   Westminster Confession. 'To this Confession,' the Preface states, 'we
   fully assent, as do our brethren of New England and the churches also
   of Scotland, as each in their general synods have testified. A few
   things we have added for obviating some erroneous opinions, and made
   other additions and alterations in method here and there, and some
   clearer explanations as we found occasion.' The Declaration is divided
   into thirty-two chapters, in the same order as the Westminster
   Confession, which has thirty-three chapters. In the exceptions taken
   the Savoy Council followed the example set by the Long Parliament in
   its edition of the Westminster Confession. The only important changes
   refer to matters of Church government and discipline. Chaps. XXX., 'Of
   Church Censures,' and XXXI., 'Of Synods and Councils,' are omitted
   altogether. Chaps. XXIII. (XXIV.), 'Of the Civil Magistrates,' XXIV.
   (XXV.), 'Of Marriage and Divorce,' and XXVI., 'Of the Church,' are
   modified. Chap. XX., 'Of the Gospel,' in the Savoy Declaration, is
   inserted, and hence the difference in the numbering of the remaining
   chapters. The change in Chap. XXIV. is a decided improvement, if we
   judge it from the American theory of Church and State. A similar and
   more thorough change was subsequently made by the American
   Presbyterians in the Westminster Confession.

   3. The Declaration of 'the Institution of Churches and the Order
   appointed in them by Jesus Christ' contains the principles of the
   Congregational Church polity which we have already explained. Similar
   Platforms of Discipline, as they are called, have been issued from time
   to time by the American Congregationalists--at Cambridge, 1648, at
   Saybrook, 1708, and at Boston, 1865.

   THE DECLARATION OF 1833.

   This is a popular abridgment of the older confessions, and presents a
   milder form of Calvinism. It was prepared in 1833 by the Rev. Dr.
   Redford, of Worcester, and other members of a committee of the
   'Congregational Union of England and Wales,' which was organized in
   1831. It is annually printed in the 'Congregational Year-Book,' but it
   disclaims any authority as a standard of subscription. [1605]

   Note.--The Rev. Dr. John Stoughton, of London, a leading divine and
   historian among the English Independents, has kindly supplied me with
   the following statement concerning the prevailing sentiment of that
   body on the authority of creeds, a statement which applies largely to
   American Congregationalists in the present age:

   'Looking at the principles of Congregationalism, which involve the
   repudiation of all human authority in matters of religion, it is
   impossible to believe that persons holding those principles can
   consistently regard any ecclesiastical creed or symbol in the same way
   in which Catholics, whether Roman or Anglican, regard the creeds of the
   ancient Church. There is a strong feeling among English
   Congregationalists against the use of such documents for the purpose of
   defining the limits of religious communion, or for the purpose of
   checking the exercise of sober, free inquiry; and there is also a
   widely spread conviction that it is impossible to reduce the expression
   of Christian belief to a series of logical propositions, so as to
   preserve and represent the full spirit of gospel truth. No doubt there
   may be heard in some circles a great deal of loose conversation seeming
   to indicate such a repugnance to the employment of creeds as would
   imply a dislike to any formal definition of Christian doctrine
   whatever; but I apprehend that the prevailing sentiment relative to
   this subject among our ministers and churches does not go beyond the
   point just indicated. Many consider that while creeds are objectionable
   as tests and imperfect as confessions, yet they may have a certain
   value as manifestoes of conviction on the part of religious
   communities.

   'The Westminster Assembly's Catechism never had the authority in
   Congregational churches which from the beginning it possessed in the
   Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and its use in schools and families
   for educational purposes, once very common, has diminished of late
   years to a very low degree. The Savoy Declaration, which perhaps never
   had much weight with Congregationalists, is a document now little
   known, except by historical students. The Declaration of 1833 was
   prepared by a committee of the Congregational Union, of which the Rev.
   Dr. Redford, of Worcester, was a member. He, I believe, drew up the
   Articles, and it was only in accordance with his well-known character
   as a zealous antagonist of human authority in religion that he
   introduced the following passages in the preliminary notes:

   '"It is not designed, in the following summary, to do more than to
   state the leading doctrines of faith and order maintained by
   Congregational churches in general.

   '"It is not intended that the following statement should be put forth
   with any authority, or as a standard to which assent should be
   required.

   '"Disallowing the utility of creeds and articles of religion as a bond
   of union, and protesting against subscription to any human formularies
   as a term of communion, Congregationalists are yet willing to declare,
   for general information, what is commonly believed among them,
   reserving to every one the most perfect liberty of conscience."

   'It would be well to insert a statement made to me by one who from his
   official position has the best means of ascertaining the state of
   opinion in our churches:

   '"I do not believe that the Declaration of 1833 could now with success
   be submitted for adoption to an Assembly of the Congregational Union;
   in part, because not a few would dispute its position, and in part
   because many more--I believe the majority--without objecting on
   strictly doctrinal grounds, would object on grounds of policy."

   'I may add to this, in the words of the Dean of Westminster, who wrote
   them on the authority of "a respected Congregational minister," that,
   beyond care in the matter of ordination, "no measures are adopted or
   felt to be either desirable or necessary for preserving uniformity of
   doctrine, excepting only that the trust-deeds of most of their places
   of worship contain a reference to leading points of doctrine to which
   the minister may be required to express his assent. In practice this is
   merely a provision against any decided departure from the faith as
   commonly received among us, the trustees of the property having it in
   their power to refuse the use of the building to any minister whose
   teaching may be contrary to the doctrines contained in the deed. Such
   cases, however, are extremely rare."

   'In some cases trust-deeds make reference to the Declaration of 1833,
   as containing the doctrines to be taught in substance within the places
   of worship secured by such deeds; but in most cases a brief schedule of
   doctrines is employed, of which the following is an example:

   '"1. The divine and special inspiration of the holy Scriptures of the
   Old and New Testament, and their supreme authority in faith and
   practice.

   '"2. The unity of God. The Deity of the Father, of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost.

   '"3. The depravity of man, and the absolute necessity of the Holy
   Spirit's agency in man's regeneration and sanctification.

   '"4. The incarnation of the Son of God, in the person of the Lord Jesus
   Christ; the universal sufficiency of the atonement by his death; and
   the free justification of sinners by faith alone in him.

   '"5. Salvation by grace, and the duty of all who hear the gospel to
   believe in Christ.

   '"6. The resurrection of the dead and the final judgment, when the
   wicked 'shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous
   into life eternal.'"

   'The Secretary of our Chapel Building Society informs me that "one
   reason for the disuse of the Declaration may be its length, and the
   circumstance that, to put it beyond question that document is meant, it
   has been thought it would be needful to embody it in the deed, which
   would add to the cost."

   'It has been remarked, on the authority of one already cited, "that,
   notwithstanding the absence of tests, there is among Independents a
   marked uniformity of opinion on all important points." Perhaps this
   statement, still true on the whole, would require more qualification
   than it did some years ago. There are among us a few men of mental
   vigor who have departed very considerably from the published creeds of
   Congregationalism. There may be a larger number whose opinions are of
   an Arminian cast; but, again to use language supplied by a friend, in
   whom I place confidence as to this subject: "It would still be fair, I
   think, to describe our ministry as moderately Calvinistic. An immense
   majority of the ministers are so. An impression to the contrary has, I
   am aware, become prevalent; but that is owing, I believe, to the fact
   that the greater number of the men who have departed from the
   Calvinistic type hold prominent positions, and have 'the habit of the
   pen.'" It is a difficult and delicate task to report the state of large
   religious communities among whose members there exist some diversities
   of opinion. One person biased by his own predilections will give one
   account, and another person under an influence of the same kind will
   give another.

   'In what I have said I have endeavored to be as impartial as possible;
   and, to give the more weight to my statements, I have sought the
   assistance of official brethren who have wider means of information
   than I possess, and who may look at things from points of view not
   exactly identical with my own.'

   [1602] The Savoy, in the Strand, London, is remarkable for its
   historical associations. The palace, on the banks of the Thames, was
   built by Peter, Earl of Savoy and Richmond, in 1245; enlarged and
   beautified by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, 1328. King John II., of France,
   while a prisoner in England, resided there (1357-63). It was burned in
   Wat Tyler's insurrection, 1381; rebuilt and endowed as a hospital by
   Henry VII., 1505. It was the city residence of the Bishop of London.
   The royal chapel was burned down in 1864, but beautifully restored by
   Queen Victoria, and reopened Nov. 26, 1865. The Congregational meeting
   of 1658 must not be confounded with the 'Savoy Conference' between
   Episcopalians and Presbyterians which was held there from April 15 to
   July 25, 1661.

   [1604] Comp. Stoughton, 1.c. pp. 81 sqq. Green (History of the English
   People, p. 573) judges upon the whole quite favorably of Cromwell's
   ecclesiastical polity: 'In England, Cromwell dealt with the Royalists
   as irreconcilable enemies; but in every other respect he carried out
   fairly his pledge of "healing and settling." . . . From the Church,
   which was thus reorganized, all power of interference with faiths
   differing from its own was resolutely withheld. Cromwell remained true
   to his great cause of religious liberty. Even the Quaker, rejected by
   all other Christian bodies as an anarchist and blasphemer, found
   sympathy and protection in Cromwell. The Jews had been excluded from
   England since the reign of Edward the First; and a prayer which they
   now presented for leave to return was refused by the commission of
   merchants and divines to whom the Protector referred it for
   consideration. But the refusal was quietly passed over, and the
   connivance of Cromwell in the settlement of a few Hebrews in London and
   Oxford was so clearly understood that no one ventured to interfere with
   them.'

   The American Congregationalists have from time to time adopted the
   Westminster standards of doctrine, with the exception of the sections
   relating to synodical Church government. Formerly the Assembly's
   Shorter Catechism was taught in all the schools of New England; but of
   late years those standards have gone much out of use, though they have
   never been disowned.

   THE SYNOD OF CAMBRIDGE, 1648. [1606]

   The 'Elders and Messengers of the churches assembled in the Synod at
   Cambridge, in New England,' in June, 1648, adopted the Westminster
   Confession one year after its publication, in these words: 'This Synod
   having perused and considered with much gladness of heart, and
   thankfulness to God, the Confession of Faith published of late by the
   reverend Assembly in England, do judge it to be very holy, orthodox,
   and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and
   fully consent thereunto, for the substance thereof. Only in those
   things which have respect to Church government and discipline [in some
   sections of Chaps. XXV., XXX., and XXXI.] we refer ourselves to the
   Platform of Church Discipline agreed upon by this present assembly; and
   do therefore think it meet that this Confession of Faith should be
   commended to the churches of Christ among us, and to the honored court,
   as worthy of their consideration and acceptance. Howbeit, we may not
   conceal, that the doctrine of vocation, expressed in Chap. X., § 1, and
   summarily repeated in Chap. XIII., § 1, passed not without some debate.
   Yet considering that the term of vocation and others by which it is
   described are capable of a large or more strict sense or use, and that
   it is not intended to bind apprehensions precisely in point of order or
   method, there hath been a general condescendency thereunto. Now by this
   our professed consent and free concurrence with them in all the
   doctrinals of religion, we hope it may appear to the world that as we
   are a remnant of the people of the same nation with them, so we are
   professors of the same common faith, and fellow-heirs of the same
   common salvation.'

   The Cambridge Synod thus anticipated by ten years the work of the Savoy
   Conference (1658).

   The Cambridge Platform, which is said to be the work of the Rev.
   Richard Mather, sets forth in substance the same principles of
   independent Church government and discipline as the Savoy Declaration.

   THE SYNOD OF BOSTON, 1680.

   The Synod of Elders and Messengers of the New England Congregational
   churches, held in Boston, Mass., May 12, 1680, adopted and published
   the Savoy recension of the Westminster Confession, together with the
   Cambridge Platform. It says, in the preface to its Declaration:

   'That which was consented unto by the Elders and Messengers of the
   Congregational churches in England, who met at the Savoy (being for the
   most part, some small variations excepted, the same with that which was
   agreed upon first by the Assembly at Westminster, and was approved of
   by the Synod at Cambridge, in New England, anno 1648, as also by a
   General Assembly in Scotland), was twice publicly read, examined, and
   approved of: that little variation which we have made from the one, in
   compliance with the other, may be seen by those who please to compare
   them. But we have (for the main) chosen to express ourselves in the
   words of those reverend Assemblies, that so we might not only with one
   heart, but with one mouth, glorify God and our Lord Jesus Christ.'
   [1607]

   THE SYNOD OF SAYBROOK, 1708.

   The Elders and Messengers of the churches in the Colony of Connecticut
   assembled at Saybrook, Sept. 9, 1708, agreed that the Boston Confession
   should 'be recommended to the honorable general assembly of this
   Colony, at the next session, for their public testimony thereunto, as
   the faith of the churches of the Colony.' They also accepted 'the Heads
   of Agreement assented to [in 1692] by the united ministers [of
   England], formerly called Presbyterian and Congregational,' and so
   virtually gave indorsement to three creeds as essentially teaching the
   same system--the doctrinal part of the Articles of the Church of
   England, the Westminster Confession or Catechisms, and the Confession
   agreed on at the Savoy.

   THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF BOSTON, 1865. [1608]

   The National Council of Congregational churches of the United States,
   held in the Old South Meeting-house of the city of Boston after the
   close of the Civil War (which suggested this Council), in the year 1865
   (June 14-24), adopted a 'Declaration of Faith.' This Declaration passed
   through three transformations:

   The first draft was prepared by a committee consisting of three divines
   (two progressive, one conservative), viz., Dr. Joseph P. Thompson (then
   Pastor of the Church of the Tabernacle, New York), Dr. Edward A.
   Lawrence (Prof. in the Theol. Seminary of East Windsor [now at
   Hartford], Conn.), and Dr. George P. Fisher (Prof. of Ecclesiastical
   History in Yale College). The Committee declined to give a formulated
   statement of doctrines, but characterized, in a comprehensive way, the
   doctrines held in common by the Congregational churches, and referred
   to the ancient Confessions of Westminster and Savoy, as sufficiently
   answering the end of a substantial unity in doctrine. This draft was
   read, discussed, and referred to a larger committee.

   The second draft was presented by the Rev. J. O. Fiske, of Bath, Maine,
   and in conformity with the usage of the councils at Cambridge, 1648, at
   Boston, 1680, and at Saybrook, 1708, expresses adherence to the
   Westminster and Savoy Confessions for 'substance of doctrine' and the
   system of truths commonly known as 'Calvinism,' and emphasizes in
   opposition to modern infidelity the doctrine of the Trinity, the
   incarnation, the atonement, and other fundamental articles of the
   common Christian faith.

   The third draft was read by the Rev. Alonzo H. Quint, by direction of
   the business committee, at a meeting of the Council held June 22d, on
   Burial Hill, Plymouth, on the spot where the first meeting-house of the
   Pilgrims stood, and which Dr. Bacon declared to be to
   Congregationalists 'the holiest spot of all the earth.' This paper was
   substantially approved and referred to a committee of revision to
   improve the form. This committee reported, Friday, June 23, through the
   Rev. Dr. Stearns, President of Amherst College, a number of slight
   verbal alterations. In this improved form the Declaration was twice
   read 'in a distinct and impressive manner,' and after prayer by the
   Rev. Dr. Ray Palmer, of New York, unanimously adopted by rising. The
   singing of Dr. Palmer's well-known hymn, 'My faith looks up to thee,'
   and the old doxology, 'To God the Father, God the Son,' concluded the
   solemnity. [1609]

   The same Council adopted a new Platform of Discipline, called the
   Boston Platform of 1865, and published by the Congregational Board.
   This virtually supersedes the Cambridge and Saybrook Platforms.

   THE OBERLIN NATIONAL COUNCIL, 1871.

   The Oberlin Council of 1871 is the first of a regular triennial series
   of National Councils of the Congregational churches in the United
   States. [1610] It adopted a constitution, one paragraph of which
   briefly refers to the rule of faith in a very general way. [1611]

   Note.--Besides the creeds of General Councils, there are in use among
   American Congregationalists a great number and variety of creeds,
   concerning which the Rev. Edward W. Gilman, D.D. (Secretary of the
   American Bible Society) kindly furnishes the following information:

    '1. State Associations and Conferences..

   'The usage is various. The General Association of Massachusetts,
   founded in 1803, accepts as a basis of union "the doctrines of
   Christianity as they are generally expressed in the Assembly's Shorter
   Catechism." So do the General Convention of Vermont, founded 1796, and
   the General Association of New Hampshire, founded 1747. The General
   Association of New York, founded 1834, has separate Articles of Faith.
   So has the General Association of Illinois. The General Conferences of
   Maine and Connecticut have no express doctrinal basis.

    '2. County Consociations (of twenty or thirty churches).

   ' The Lincoln and Kennebec Consociation (Maine), 1808, recommended to
   its constituent churches Articles of "Union, Faith, and Practice." The
   Northwestern Consociation (Vermont), 1818, recommended to its churches
   a uniform Confession and Covenant. The Litchfield South Consociation
   (Conn.), 1828, prepared a Confession and Covenant for the general use
   of its churches. The New Haven West Consociation (Conn.) admits only
   churches which accept the doctrinal part of the Saybrook Platform.

    '3. Institutions of Learning.

   'The Hollis Professor of Divinity in Harvard College must "declare it
   as his belief that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the
   only perfect rule of faith and practice," and the first incumbent
   (1722), being examined by the Corporation, declared his assent to the
   Confession of Faith in the Assembly's Catechism and to the doctrinal
   Articles of the Church of England. Assent to the Westminster Confession
   or the Saybrook Platform was required of Professors in Yale College
   from 1753 to 1823. In the Theological Institution at Andover both
   Visitors and Professors are required to subscribe a Declaration of
   Faith drawn up by the founders in 1808, and to renew this declaration
   at intervals of five years.

    '4. Local Churches.

   'The types are various, and while each church is at liberty to
   construct and alter its own formulas, certain tendencies towards
   uniformity of usage, at different periods, are noticeable.

   '(a) Individual Professions. Such were those made by John Cotton, at
   Charlestown, in 1630, and by John Davenport, at New Haven, in 1639.
   (See the latter in Ancient Waymarks, published at New Haven in 1853.
   See also Cong. Quarterly, 1869, Vol. XI. p. 517.)

   '(b) Brief general references, either to the holy Scriptures as the
   only rule of belief and duty, or to the Westminster Catechism or the
   Boston (i.e., Savoy) Confession, as agreeable to the Scriptures. This
   usage came in at an early day, and was current at the beginning of this
   century.

   '(c) Articles of Faith, embracing in theological phraseology the
   outlines of a system of divinity. After the year 1800 these came into
   general use as formulas for the reception of members, and great
   reliance was placed upon them as helps in maintaining the purity of the
   churches against the inroads of false doctrine. Candidates for
   admission to Church privileges were required to give their assent to
   the several propositions, which thus in many cases were made tests of
   worthiness. Dr. Samuel Worcester (Fitchburg, 1798) and Dr. E. D.
   Griffin, the first pastor of the Park Street Church, Boston (1811), had
   much to do in shaping the practice of the churches from their day to
   the present time. Formulas of this class have, however, been subjected
   to various modifications, by way of accommodation to individual
   opinions, or for the sake of denying current error, or of emphasizing
   truths peculiar to the Calvinistic system, but especially in order to
   secure brevity in the Church service. In this way it has unfortunately
   sometimes happened that doctrines fundamental to Christianity have
   failed to find a place in the formal Confession of Faith.

   '(d) Creeds divested of theological terms, and clothed in language so
   clear and simple and general as to prevent no Christian from giving
   them his prompt and hearty assent. The revisions of the last twenty
   years have been looking in this direction, and churches are beginning
   to be formed with no other symbol of faith than the Apostles' Creed.'

   or matter of special concern to all the churches seemed to justify

   The various branches of the Baptist family of Christians [1612] differ
   very widely, and have little or no connection except that they agree in
   rejecting infant baptism and in requiring a personal and voluntary
   profession of faith in Christ as a necessary condition of baptism. Most
   of them agree also in opposition to sprinkling, or any other mode of
   baptism but that by total immersion of the body in water. The largest
   and most respectable denomination of Baptists took its rise in the
   great religious commotion of England during the seventeenth century,
   and differed from the Puritans only in the doctrine of baptism and in
   the steadfast advocacy of religious freedom. But the Baptist movement
   began a century earlier on the Continent, and this first stage must at
   least be briefly noticed.

   THE ANABAPTISTS.

   The early history of the Anabaptists exhibits a strange chaos of
   peaceful reforms and violent revolutions--separatism, mysticism,
   millenarianism, spiritualism, contempt of history, ascetic rigor,
   fanaticism, communism, and some novel speculations concerning the body
   of Christ as being directly created by God, and different from the
   flesh and blood of other men. An impartial history, with a careful
   critical sifting of these incongruous elements, is still a desideratum.

   The modern Anabaptists [1613] figure prominently in the history of the
   Reformation, and meet us in Germany, Switzerland, Holland, and England.
   They were Protestant radicals, who rejected infant baptism as an
   invention of the Roman Antichrist, and aimed at a thorough
   reconstruction of the Church. They spread mostly among the laboring
   classes. Some of their preachers had no regular education, despised
   human learning, and relied on direct inspiration; but others were
   learned and eloquent men, as Grebel, Manz, Hetzer, Hübmaier, Denk,
   Röublin, and Rothmann. They were regarded as a set of dangerous
   fanatics, who could not be tolerated under a Christian government.
   Their supposed or real connection with the Peasant War, against the
   tyranny of landholders (1524), and with the bloody and disastrous
   excesses at Münster (1534), increased the opposition. Their doctrines
   were condemned in the Lutheran and Reformed Confessions. The Reformers,
   even the mildest among them (Melanchthon, Bucer, Bullinger, and
   Cranmer, as well as Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin), felt that their
   extermination was necessary for the salvation of the churchly
   Reformation and social order. And yet they must have known worthy men
   among them; Calvin himself married the widow of an Anabaptist pastor.
   Protestant and Roman Catholic magistrates vied with each other in
   cruelty against them, and put them to death by drowning, hanging, and
   burning.

   But it is the greatest injustice to make the Anabaptists as such
   responsible for the extravagances that led to the tragedy at Münster.
   Their original and final tendencies were orderly and peaceful. They
   disowned the wild fanaticism of Thomas Münzer, John Bockelsohn, and
   Knipperdolling. They were opposed to war and violence. They were the
   crude harbingers and martyrs of some truths which have germinated in
   other ages. They upheld the necessity of discipline and congregational
   organization on the basis of personal faith in Christ, instead of
   carnal descent and parochial boundaries. They attacked the doctrine of
   the eternal damnation of unbaptized infants, and the equally horrible
   doctrine of persecution. Balthasar Hübmaier (Hübmör, or, as he was
   called by a Latin name, Pacimontanus), the ablest and most learned
   among the Anabaptists, a pupil of Dr. Eck (Luther's opponent), and for
   some time Professor of Catholic Theology at Ingolstadt, then a zealous
   and eloquent Protestant preacher, was perhaps the first who taught the
   principle of universal religious liberty, on the ground that Christ
   came not to kill and to burn, but to save, and condemned the employment
   of force in his kingdom. He held that those only are heretics who
   willfully and wickedly oppose the holy Scriptures; and even these ought
   to be treated by no other than moral means of persuasion and
   instruction. [1614] He was burned at the stake in Vienna, March
   10,1528, and died with pious joy; his wife, who encouraged him in his
   martyr spirit, was three days afterwards drowned in the Danube.

   THE MENNONITES.

   Menno Simons, a converted Roman Catholic priest, collected the
   scattered remnant of the Anabaptists into a well-organized, peaceful,
   and industrious community in Holland and on the borders of Germany
   (1536). He gave them a strict system of discipline, and endeavored to
   revive the idea of a pure apostolic congregation consisting of true
   believers unmixed with the world. He labored in constant peril of life
   with untiring patience till his death, Jan. 13, 1561. 'For eighteen
   years,' he says, 'with my poor feeble wife and little children, has it
   behooved me to bear great and various anxieties, sufferings, griefs,
   afflictions, miseries, and persecutions, and in every place to find a
   bare existence, in fear and danger of my life. While some preachers are
   reclining on their soft beds and downy pillows, we oft are hidden in
   the caves of the earth; while they are celebrating the nuptial or natal
   days of their children with feasts and pipes, and rejoicing with the
   timbrel and the harp, we are looking anxiously about, fearing the
   barking of the dogs, lest persecutors should be suddenly at the door;
   while they are saluted by all around as doctors, masters, lords, we are
   compelled to hear ourselves called Anabaptists, ale-house preachers,
   seducers, heretics, and to be hailed in the devil's name. In a word,
   while they for their ministry are remunerated with annual stipends and
   prosperous days, our wages are the fire, the sword, the death.' [1615]

   His followers were called Mennonites after his death. [1616] They
   acquired at last toleration, first in Holland from Prince William of
   Orange, 1572, and full liberty in 1626. They spread to the Palatinate,
   Switzerland, Eastern Prussia, and by emigration to South Russia,
   Pennsylvania, and other parts of North America. Quite recently several
   hundred families left their Russian settlements for America because the
   privilege of exemption from military service was withdrawn. They are a
   small, quiet, peaceful, industrious, and moral community, like the
   Quakers. Their historian, Schyn, labors to show that they have no
   connection whatever with the fanatical and revolutionary Anabaptists of
   Münster.

   The Mennonites were divided during the lifetime of Menno into two
   parties on questions of discipline: 1, the 'coarse' Mennonites (die
   Groben), or Waterlanders, who were more numerous, and flourished in the
   Waterland district of North Holland; 2, the 'refined' Mennonites (die
   Feinen), who were chiefly Flemings, Frieslanders, and Germans. The
   latter adhered to the strict discipline of the founder.

   The Mennonites acknowledge 'the Confession of Waterland,' which was
   drawn up by two of their preachers, John Ris (Haus de Rys) and Lubbert
   Gerardi (Gerritsz), in the Dutch language. [1617]

   It consists of forty Articles, and teaches, besides the common
   doctrines of Protestant orthodoxy, the peculiar views of this
   community. It rejects oaths (Art. XXXVIII., on the ground of Matt. v.
   37 and James v. 10), war (XVIII.), and secular office-holding, because
   it is not commanded by Christ and is inconsistent with true Christian
   character; but it enjoins obedience to the civil magistrate as a divine
   appointment wherever it does not contradict the Word of God and
   interfere with the dictates of conscience (XXXVII.). The Church
   consists of the faithful and regenerate men scattered over the earth,
   under Christ the Lord and King (XXIV.). Infant baptism is rejected as
   unscriptural (XXXI.); but the Mennonites differ from other Baptists by
   sprinkling. [1618] On the Lord's Supper they agree with Zwingli. They
   admit hereditary sin, but deny its guilt (Art. IV.). They hold to
   conditional election and universal redemption. [1619] But during the
   Arminian controversy a portion sided with the strict Calvinists. They
   reject also law-suits, revenge, every kind of violence, and worldly
   amusements. In many respects they are the forerunners of the Quakers
   quite as much as of the English and American Baptists.

   together.' The articles of the Moravian Anabaptists forbade the Lord's
   Supper to persons having property.--Ed.]

   The English and American Baptists have inherited some of the principles
   without the eccentricities and excesses of the Continental Anabaptists
   and Mennonites. [1620] They are radical but not revolutionary in
   politics and religion, and as sober, orderly, peaceful, zealous, and
   devoted as any other class of Christians. They rose simultaneously in
   England and America during the Puritan conflict, and have become, next
   to the Methodists, the strongest denomination in the United States.

   The great body of Baptists are called Regular or Particular or
   Calvinistic Baptists, in distinction from the smaller body of General
   or Arminian or Free-Will Baptists. They are Calvinists in doctrine and
   Independents in Church polity, but differ from both in their views on
   the subjects and mode of baptism. They teach that believers only ought
   to be baptized, that is, dipped or immersed, on a voluntary confession
   of their faith. They reject infant baptism as an unscriptural
   innovation and profanation of the sacrament, since an infant can not
   hear the gospel, nor repent and make a profession of faith. They
   believe, however, in the salvation of all children dying before the age
   of responsibility. Baptism in their system has no regenerative and
   saving efficacy: it is simply an outward sign of grace already
   bestowed, a public profession of faith in Christ to the world, and an
   entrance into the privileges and duties of church membership. [1621]
   They also opposed from the start national church establishments, and
   the union of Church and State, which one of their greatest writers
   (Robert Hall) calls 'little more than a compact between the priest and
   the magistrate to betray the liberties of mankind, both civil and
   religious.' They advocate voluntaryism, and make the doctrine of
   religions freedom, as an inherent and universal right of man, a part of
   their creed.

   THE BAPTISTS IN ENGLAND.

   In England the Baptists were for a long time treated with extreme
   severity on account of their supposed connection with the fanatical
   fraction of the German and Dutch Anabaptists. A number of them who had
   fled from Holland were condemned to death or exiled (1535 and 1539).
   Latimer speaks, in a sermon before Edward VI., of Anabaptists who were
   burned to death under Henry VIII., in divers towns, and met their fate
   'cheerfully and without any fear.'

   Under Edward VI. they became numerous in the south of England,
   especially in Kent and Essex. Two were burned--a Dutchman, named George
   van Pare, and an English woman, Joan Boucher, usually called Joan of
   Kent. These were the only executions for heresy during his reign. The
   young king reluctantly and with tears yielded to Cranmer, who urged on
   him from the Mosaic law the duty of punishing blasphemy and fundamental
   heresy. Joan of Kent, besides rejecting infant baptism, was charged
   with holding the doctrine of some German and Dutch Anabaptists, that
   Christ's sinless humanity was not taken 'from the substance of the
   Virgin Mary,' who was a sinner, but was immediately created by God. She
   resisted every effort of Cranmer to change her views, and preferred
   martyrdom (May 2, 1550). Several of the Forty-two Edwardine Articles
   were directed against the Anabaptists.

   Under Elizabeth a congregation of Dutch Anabaptists was discovered in
   London; twenty-seven members were imprisoned, some recanted, some were
   banished from the kingdom. The two most obstinate, John Wielmaker and
   Henry Terwoort, were committed to the flames in Smithfield, July 22,
   1575, notwithstanding the petition of John Foxe, the martyrologist, who
   begged the queen to spare them, not indeed from prison or exile (which
   he deemed a just punishment for heresy), but from being 'roasted alive
   in fire and flame,' which was 'a hard thing, and more agreeable to the
   practice of Romanists than to the custom of Evangelicals.' [1622] These
   Dutch Anabaptists were charged with 'most damnable and detestable
   heresies,' such as that Christ took not flesh from the substance of
   Mary; that infants ought not to be baptized; that it is not lawful for
   a Christian man to be a magistrate or bear the sword or take an oath.
   These are evidently doctrines of the Mennonites, afterwards adopted by
   the Quakers, and now generally tolerated without any injury to society.

   During the reigns of James and Charles the Baptists made common cause
   with the Puritans, especially the Independents, against the prelatical
   Church, but withdrew more completely from the national worship, and
   secretly assembled in woods, stables, and barns for religious worship.
   They began to organize separate congregations (1633), but were punished
   whenever discovered. Many fled to Holland, and some to America. Their
   earliest publications were pleas for liberty of conscience. [1623]

   With the Long Parliament they acquired a little freedom, though their
   views were opposed by Presbyterians and Independents, as well as by
   Episcopalians. They increased rapidly during the civil wars. In 1644
   they numbered seven congregations in London, and forty-seven in the
   country. Cromwell left them unmolested. He had many of them in his
   army, and some even held positions in his experimental Broad Church.
   [1624] Milton is claimed by them, on the ground of a passage
   unfavorable to infant baptism, but with no more justice than Arians,
   Unitarians, and Quakers may claim him. [1625]

   After the Restoration they were again persecuted by fines,
   imprisonment, and torture. They suffered more severely than any other
   Non-conformists, except the Quakers. Among their most distinguished
   confessors, who spent much time in prison, were Vavasor Powell (d.
   1670), Hanserd Knollys (d. 1690), [1626] Benjamin Keach, and John
   Bunyan (d. 1688).

   The Act of Toleration (1689) brought relief to the Baptists, and
   enabled them to build chapels and spread throughout the country. Since
   then they have become one of the leading branches of Dissenters in
   England. They have produced some of the most eminent preachers and
   authors in the English language, such as John Bunyan, Andrew Fuller,
   Robert Hall, John Foster, Joseph Angus, C. H. Spurgeon.

   ROGER WILLIAMS.

   Literature.

   1854), and Elton (1852); also Arnold's History of Rhode Island (1860),
   Vol. I.; Palfrey's History of New England, Vols. I. and II.; Bancroft's

   Massachusetts Plantation (Boston, 1876); J. L. Diman, Monument to R. W.
   in Providence (Providence, 1877).

   The works of Williams were republished by the Narragansett Club (First
   Series, Vol. I., Providence, 1866), and by Underhill for the Hanserd
   Knollys Society (London, 1848).


   In America the Baptists trace their origin chiefly but not exclusively
   to Roger Williams (b. probably in Wales, 1599, [1627] d. in Providence,
   R. I., 1683), the founder of Rhode Island. Originally a clergyman in
   the Church of England, he became a rigid separatist, a radical
   come-outer of all Church establishments, an 'arch-individualist,' and
   an advocate of 'soul-liberty' in the widest acceptation of the term. He
   was a pious, zealous, unselfish, kind-hearted, but eccentric,
   'conscientiously contentions,' and impracticable genius, a real
   troubler in Israel, who could not get along with any body but himself;
   and this accounts for his troubles, which, however, were overruled for
   good. Cotton Mather compared him to a windmill, which, by its rapid
   motion in consequence of a violent storm, became so intensely heated
   that it took fire and endangered the whole town.

   Pursued out of his land by Bishop Laud, as he says, he emigrated with a
   heavy heart, in company with his wife Mary, to the colony of
   Massachusetts, and arrived after a tedious and tempestuous voyage in
   February, 1631.

   He first exercised his ministerial gifts as an assistant to the pastor
   of Plymouth Colony, and acquired a knowledge of the Indian language. In
   1633 he removed to Salem as assistant of Mr. Skelton, and in 1635 he
   was ordained pastor of Salem Church. But he was even then in open
   opposition to the prevailing views and customs of the colony, and
   refused to take the oath of fidelity. Besides this, he was charged with
   advocating certain opinions supposed to be dangerous, viz., that the
   magistrate ought not to punish offenses against the first table; that
   an oath ought not to be tendered to an unregenerate man; that a
   regenerate man ought not to pray with the unregenerate, though it be
   his wife or child; that a man ought not to give thanks after the
   sacrament nor after meat. He was unwilling to retract, and advised his
   church to withdraw from communion with the other churches of the
   colony, 'as full of anti-Christian pollution.' For these reasons the
   court banished Williams (Oct., 1635). The question of toleration was
   implied in the first charge; he denied the jurisdiction of the civil
   magistrate over matters of conscience and religion, and defended this
   principle afterwards in a book, 'The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for
   Cause of Conscience,' against John Cotton (1644). [1628] His views on
   baptism were developed afterwards; but they would only have aggravated
   his case, and in fact his rebaptism brought upon him the sentence of
   excommunication from the church of Salem, of which he was still
   nominally a member. [1629]

   The banishment was the best thing that could have happened to Williams:
   it led to the development of his heroic qualities, and gave him a
   prominent position in American history. He left Salem with a few
   friends, and made his way in dreary winter through 'a howling
   wilderness' to the wigwams of his Indian friends, and was sorely tossed
   in frost and snow among barbarians for fourteen weeks, 'not knowing
   what bread or bed did mean.' In June, 1636, he founded with five
   families who adhered to him the town of Providence. He scrupulously
   bought the land from the Indians, and acted as pastor of this
   democratic settlement. In 1638 he became a Baptist; he was immersed by
   Ezekiel Hollyman, and in turn immersed Hollyman and ten others. This
   was the first Baptist church on the American Continent. But a few
   months afterwards he renounced his rebaptism on the ground that
   Hollyman was unbaptized, and therefore unauthorized to administer the
   rite to him. He remained for the rest of his life a 'Seeker,' cut loose
   from all existing Church organizations and usages, longing for a true
   Church of God, but unable to find one on the face of the whole earth.
   He conceived 'that the apostasy of Antichrist hath so far corrupted all
   that there can be no recovery out of that apostasy till Christ send
   forth, new apostles to plant churches anew.'

   In 1643 he went to England, and obtained through the Commissioners of
   Plantation a charter which allowed the planters to rule themselves
   according to the laws of England, 'so far as the nature of the case
   would admit.' In 1663 he accepted for the colony another and more
   successful charter, a patent from the English crown similar to that of
   Massachusetts, to which he had formerly objected. He kept up friendly
   relations with the Indians, and twice saved the Massachusetts colony
   from danger, thus returning good for evil. His fame rests on his
   advocacy of the sacredness of conscience. Bancroft goes too far when in
   his eloquent eulogy he calls him 'the first person in modern
   Christendom who asserted in its plenitude the doctrine of the liberty
   of conscience, the equality of opinions before the law.' The
   Anabaptists and Mennonites had done the same a hundred years before.
   But Williams planted the first civil government on the principle of
   universal 'soul-liberty,' and was followed by William Penn in his
   Quaker colony in Pennsylvania. Roger Williams has been called 'that
   noble confessor of religious liberty, that extraordinary man and most
   enlightened legislator, who, after suffering persecution from his
   brethren, persevered, amidst incredible hardships and difficulties, in
   seeking a place of refuge for the sacred ark of conscience.' [1630]

   In the other colonies the Baptists were more or less persecuted till
   the time of the Revolution, but after that they spread with great
   rapidity.

   The American Baptists differ from their English brethren by a stricter
   discipline and closer communion practice. They are very zealous in
   missions, education, and other departments of Christian activity. In
   theology they cultivate especially biblical studies with great success.

   BAPTIST CONFESSIONS.

   The Baptists, like the Congregationalists, lower the authority of
   general creeds to mere declarations of faith prevailing at the time in
   the denomination, to which no one is bound to give assent beyond the
   pleasure of his conviction; and they multiply the number and elevate
   the authority of local or congregational creeds and covenants, by which
   the members of particular congregations voluntarily bind themselves to
   a certain scheme of doctrine and duty. Notwithstanding the entire
   absence of centralization in their government, and the unrestrained
   freedom of private judgment, the Calvinistic Baptists have maintained
   as great a degree of essential harmony of faith as they themselves deem
   desirable.

   'The Baptist creeds,' says Dr. Joseph Angus, in behalf of English
   Baptists, [1631] 'were prepared in the first instance for apologetic
   and defensive purposes. They merely describe the doctrines held by the
   bodies from which they emanated. They were never imposed on ministers
   and members of the churches of either section of the Baptists. Even
   when adopted, as they sometimes were, by any church, as an expression
   of its sentiments, all sister churches were left free, and in the
   particular church a considerable latitude of judgment was allowed in
   interpreting them. They have never been accepted as tests, and merely
   represent in a general way the sentiment of the body. In trust deeds or
   in the rules of associations they never appear. Property in trust is
   held for the use of evangelical Christians maintaining the doctrines
   commonly held by Particular (or General) Baptists; sometimes these
   doctrines are enumerated in the briefest possible way--the trinity, the
   atonement, etc.--and sometimes they are not enumerated at all. Of
   course, in the event of an appeal to law, the creeds and confessions
   would be evidence of the faith of the body. Substantially the two
   sections of the Baptist body believe as of old. But their confessions
   are not authoritative except as evidence and in matters of property;
   while in the interpretation of them it is a principle to allow as much
   freedom as is consistent with a substantial agreement in the same
   general truth.'

   'Confessions of faith,' says Dr. Osgood, with special reference to the
   Baptists in the United States, [1632] 'have never been held as tests of
   orthodoxy, as of any authoritative or binding force; they merely
   reflect the existing harmony of views and the scriptural
   interpretations of the churches assenting to them. "We believe," says
   Wayland, "in the fullest sense, in the independence of every individual
   church of Christ. We hold that each several church is a Christian
   society, on which is conferred by Christ the entire power of
   self-government. No church has any power over any other church. No
   minister has any authority in any church except that which has called
   him to be its pastor. Every church, therefore, when it expresses its
   own belief, expresses the belief of no other than its own members. If
   several churches understand the Scriptures in the same way, and all
   unite in the same confession, then this expresses the opinions and
   belief of those who profess it. It, however, expresses their belief
   because all of them, from the study of the Scriptures, understand them
   in the same manner, and not because any tribunal has imposed such
   interpretations upon them. We can not acknowledge the authority of any
   such tribunal. We have no right to delegate such an authority to any
   man or to any body of men. It is our essential belief that the
   Scriptures are a revelation from God, given . . . to every individual
   man. They were given to every individual that he might understand them
   for himself, and the word that is given him will judge him at the great
   day. It is hence evident that we can have no standards which claim to
   be of any authority over us."' [1633]

   I. The Confession of the Seven Churches in London. Dr. Daniel Featley,
   a prominent Episcopalian of the Puritan party and member of the
   Westminster Assembly (from which, however, he was expelled for
   informing the king of its proceedings), had a public disputation with
   the Baptists in 1644, and published it, with a dedication to the
   Parliament, under the title, 'The Dippers dipt; or, the Anabaptists
   Duck'd and Plung'd over Head and Ears at a Disputation in Southwark.'
   [1634]

   This gave rise to a Confession of Faith, on the part of seven London
   churches, with an Epistle Dedicatory to the two houses of Parliament.
   It appeared in 1644 (three years before the Westminster Confession),
   and again with some additions and changes in 1646, under the title, 'A
   Confession of Faith of Seven Congregations or Churches of Christ in
   London, which are commonly (but unjustly) called Anabaptists.' [1635]
   This document consists of fifty-two (51) Articles, and shows that in
   all important doctrines and principles, except on the sacraments and
   Church government, the Baptists agreed with the orthodox Reformed
   Churches. The concluding paragraph admits the fallibility of human
   confessions, and the readiness of Baptists to receive further light,
   but also their determination 'to die a thousand deaths rather than do
   any thing against the least tittle of the truth of God, or against the
   light of our own consciences.'

   II. The Confession of Somerset, 1656. It was signed by the delegates of
   sixteen churches of Somerset and the adjoining counties. It consists of
   forty-six Articles. [1636]

   III. The Confession of 1688. This is by far the most important and
   authoritative. It has superseded the two earlier confessions, and is to
   this day held in the highest esteem. It appeared first in 1677, at
   London, under the title, 'A Confession of Faith put forth by the Elders
   and Brethren of many congregations of Christians baptized upon
   profession of their faith.' It was reprinted in 1688, 1689, and
   approved and recommended by the ministers and messengers of above a
   hundred congregations met in London, July 3-11, 1689. [1637] It has
   been often reprinted. [1638] 'It is still generally received by all
   those congregations that hold the doctrine of personal election and the
   certainty of the saints' final perseverance.' [1639] In America it was
   adopted by the Baptist Association which met in Philadelphia, Sept. 25,
   1742, and hence is known also by the name of the Philadelphia
   Confession.

   This Confession consists of thirty-two chapters, beginning with the
   holy Scriptures and ending with the last judgment. It is simply the
   Baptist recension of the Westminster Confession, as the Savoy
   Declaration is the Congregational recension of the same Westminster
   Confession. It follows the Westminster Confession in sentiment and
   language, with very few verbal alterations, except in the doctrine of
   the Church and the Sacraments. The Preface sets forth that the
   Confession of Westminster is retained in substance for the purpose of
   showing the agreement of the Baptists with the Presbyterians and
   Congregationalists 'in all the fundamental Articles of the Christian
   religion,' and also to convince all that they have 'no itch to clog
   religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form of sound
   words which has been, in consent with the holy Scriptures, used by
   others before us; hereby declaring before God, angels, and men our
   hearty agreement with them in that wholesome Protestant doctrine which
   with so clear evidence of Scripture they have asserted.' The Appendix
   is a defense of the Baptist theory against Pædobaptists.

   The Confession differs from that of the Westminster in the chapters on
   the Church and on the sacraments. It omits the chapter 'Of Church
   Censuses' (XXX.) and 'Of Synods and Councils.' The chapter 'Of the
   Church' (XXV.) is adapted to the independent polity; and the chapter
   'Of Baptism' is altered to suit the Baptist theory, limiting the right
   of baptism to those 'who do actually profess repentance towards God,
   faith in and obedience to our Lord Jesus,' and declaring 'immersion or
   dipping of the person in water' to be 'necessary to the due
   administration of this ordinance' (XXIX.). A chapter, 'Of the Gospel
   and the Extent of Grace thereof,' is inserted from the Savoy
   Declaration as Ch. XX. (which causes the change of the numbering of the
   chapters which follow). [1640]

   IV. In 1693 a Catechism based on this Confession was drawn up by
   William Collins, at the request of the General Assembly which met at
   London in June of that year. It is taken chiefly from the Westminster
   Shorter Catechism, and follows closely its order and method. It is also
   called 'Keach's Catechism.' Benjamin Keach was with Collins among the
   signers of the Confession of 1688, and seems to have had much to do
   with the work. It is the only Catechism which has found general
   acceptance among Baptists in England and America. [1641]

   During the seventeenth century there were also some private confessions
   written by John Bunyan, Vavasor Powell, Benjamin Keach, and Elias
   Keach.

   V. The New Hampshire Confession was prepared about 1833 or 1834, by the
   Rev. J. Newton Brown, of New Hampshire (d. 1868), the editor of a
   'Universal Cyclopædia of Religious Knowledge.' It is shorter and
   simpler than the Confession of 1688, and presents the Calvinistic
   system in a milder form. It has been accepted by the Baptists of New
   Hampshire and other Northern and Western States, and is now the most
   popular creed among American Baptists. [1642]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1620] Their older scholars claim an origin earlier than the
   Continental or the English Reformation, going back to the Waldenses and
   Albigenses, and to the Lollard movement following, in Britain, the
   labors of Wycliff. The tradition of the Holland Mennonites gave them a
   Waldensian ancestry. But these points are disputed, and no historical
   connection can be traced.

   [1621] The Campbellites, or Disciples, differ from the other Baptists
   by identifying baptismal immersion with regeneration, or teaching a
   concurrence of both acts.

   [1622] See Foxe's letter to Queen Elizabeth, in Latin, in Append. III.
   to Neal's History (Vol. II. p. 439).

   [1623] See the Tracts on Liberty of Conscience, republished for the
   Hanserd Knollys Society by E. B. Underhill (London, 1846), which
   contains seven Baptist works on this subject from 1614 to 1661. On
   Roger Williams, see below.

   [1624] Samuel Richardson, a Baptist, who knew him personally, speaks
   very highly of Cromwell, as a man who 'aimeth at the general good of
   the nation and just liberty of every man, who is faithful to the
   saints, who hath owned the poor despised people of God, and advanced
   many to a better way and means of living.' See Tracts on Liberty of
   Conscience, p. 240.

   [1625] 'Milton, it seems, withdrew at last from all Church
   organizations, regarding them with equal respect and indifference,
   except the Romanists, whom he excludes from toleration as idolaters and
   enemies of toleration. With his illustrious friend, the younger Sir
   Henry Vane, whom, as understanding the true relations of Church and
   State, he praises in one of his most beautiful sonnets, he joined the
   'Seekers,' a body looking for a more perfect Church yet to come. Roger
   Williams, the friend of both poet and statesman, joined them in his
   last years in occupying the same ground. In 1673, the year before his
   death, Milton published a treatise on 'True Religion, Heresy, Schism,
   Toleration, and the Best Means against the Growth of Popery,' in which
   he defines heresy to be 'a religion taken up and believed from the
   traditions of men and additions to the Word of God.' In this sense
   Popery is the only or the greatest heresy; its very name, Roman
   Catholic, a contradiction; one of the Pope's bulls as universal
   particular, or catholic schismatic; while Protestants are free from
   heresy, which is in the will and choice professedly against the
   Scriptures. He represents four classes of Protestants--Lutherans,
   Calvinists, Anabaptists, and Socinians--as agreed in the articles
   essential to salvation, and says: 'The Lutheran holds
   consubstantiation; an error, indeed, but not mortal. The Calvinist is
   taxed with predestination, and to make God the author of sin, not with
   any dishonorable thought of God, but it may be overzealously asserting
   his absolute power, not without plea of Scripture. The Anabaptist is
   accused of denying infants their right to baptism; again, they say they
   deny nothing but what Scripture denies them. The Arian and Socinian are
   charged to dispute against the Trinity; they affirm to believe the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost according to Scripture and the Apostolic
   Creed. As for terms of trinity, trini-unity, co-essentiality,
   tri-personality, and the like, they reject them as scholastic notions,
   not to be found in Scripture, which, by a general Protestant maxim, is
   plain and perspicuous abundantly to explain its own meaning in the
   properest words belonging to so high a matter and so necessary to be
   known; a mystery indeed in their sophistic subtleties, but in Scripture
   a plain doctrine. Their other opinions are of less moment. They dispute
   the satisfaction of Christ, or rather the word satisfaction, as not
   Scriptural, but they acknowledge him both God and their Saviour. The
   Arminian, lastly, is condemned for setting up free-will against
   free-grace; but that imputation he disclaims in all his writings, and
   grounds himself largely upon Scripture only.'

   [1626] Knollys fled to Massachusetts (1638), and preached for some time
   in the extreme northern part of the colony, but, being exposed to
   danger as a Baptist and Separatist, he returned to England in 1641. The
   society for the republication of scarce old Baptist tracts is called
   after him.

   [1627] The accounts of the year of his birth vary from 1598 to 1606. He
   was a protégé of the celebrated judge, Sir Edward Coke. Historians
   differ as to whether he was Rodericus Williams, from Wales, who entered
   Jesus College, Oxford, in 1624, or Rogerus Williams, whose name appears
   in the subscription-book of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1626. Elton
   and Masson take the former, Arnold and Dexter the latter view, which
   better agrees with his Christian name.

   [1628] This book was anonymously published in London, when Williams was
   there occupied in obtaining a charter for Rhode Island, and is
   exceedingly rare, only six copies being known to exist; but it has been
   reprinted from the copy in the Bodleian Library by Edward Bean
   Underhill, together with the Answer to Cotton's Letter and a Memoir of
   Williams (London, 1848, pp. 439 and xxxvi.). It is written in a kindly
   and moderate spirit, free from the controversial bitterness of the age,
   in the form of a conference between Truth and Peace. Williams begins
   with this sentence: 'The blood of so many hundred thousand souls of
   Protestants and Papists, spilt in the wars of present and former ages,
   for their respective consciences, is not required nor accepted by Jesus
   Christ, the Prince of Peace.' He maintains that civil government has
   nothing whatever to do with spiritual matters, over which God alone
   rules, and that religious liberty should be extended not only to all
   Christian denominations and sects, but even to 'the most Paganish,
   Jewish, Turkish, or anti-Christian consciences and worships' (p. 2).
   John Cotton, his chief opponent, wrote in reply 'The Bloudy Tenent
   washed, and made white in the Bloud of the Lambe: being discussed and
   discharged of blood-guiltiness by just Defense' (London, 1647).
   Williams defended his position in 'The Bloody Tenent yet more Bloody by
   Mr. Cotton's endeavour to wash it white in the Blood of the Lambe'
   (London, 1652, 4to, pp. 373). John Cotton (1585-1652), who emigrated to
   America two years after Williams (1633), was one of the patriarchs of
   New England, and, together with Hooker and Stone, constituted the
   'glorious triumvirate' that supplied the Puritans in the wilderness
   with their three great necessities--'Cotton for their clothing, Hooker
   for their fishing, and Stone for their building.'--Cotton Mather's
   Magnalia, Vol. III. p. 20.

   [1629] Dr. Dexter's monograph is a learned and elaborate partisan
   defense of the action of the young Colony, which, he says, 'was
   reluctantly compelled to choose between the expulsion of Williams and
   the immediate risk of social, civil, and religious disorganization' (p.
   88). He takes the ground that Williams was banished, not on religious,
   but on political grounds. But religion and politics were inseparably
   interwoven in the New England theocracy.

   [1630] Mrs. P. S. Elton, in The Piedmontese Envoy; or, The Men,
   Manners, and Religion of the Commonwealth: A Tale (London, 1852), puts
   this eulogy into the mouth of John Milton; hence it is sometimes
   falsely quoted as Milton's (Allibone, Vol. III. p. 2747).

   be most carefully looked into, and severely punished, if not utterly
   exterminated and banished out of the Church and Kingdom. . . . They
   preach and print and practice their heretical impieties openly; they

   ('The Child's Instructor: a New and Easy Primer,' 24mo, 1664), for
   which he was imprisoned under Charles II. The American Baptist
   Publication Society publishes it under the title, 'The Baptist

   § 106. Aminian or Free-will Baptists.

   IN ENGLAND.

   [See Literature on p. 845.]

   The General or Arminian Baptists differ from the Particular or
   Calvinistic Baptists in rejecting unconditional election and the
   perseverance of saints, and in maintaining the freedom of will and the
   possibility of falling from grace. So far they followed the Mennonites.
   They assign greater power to a general assembly of associated churches,
   and hold three orders--bishops or messengers, pastors or elders, and
   deacons; while the Particular Baptists, like the Congregationalists,
   recognize only two--bishops or pastors and deacons (elders being a
   title applicable to the first or to both).

   I. The first Confession of Arminian Baptists was published by English
   refugees in Holland, under the title, 'A Declaration of Faith of
   English People remaining at Amsterdam in Holland,' Amsterdam, 1611.
   [1643] It was drawn up by Smyth and Helwisse. It consists of
   twenty-seven (26) Articles. The first Article confesses the doctrine of
   the Trinity in the spurious words of 1 John v. 7. Election is
   conditioned by foreknown faith, reprobation by foreknown unbelief, and
   the perseverance of saints is denied. [1644] The Church of Christ is
   defined (Art. X.) to be 'a company of faithful people separated from
   the world by the Word and Spirit of God, being knit unto the Lord, and
   one unto another, by baptism, upon their own confession of the faith.'
   Baptism is confined to adults, but nothing is said of immersion. The
   duty of obedience to the magistrate is very earnestly enjoined (Art.
   XXIV.).

   II. The 'London Confession' was approved by more than twenty thousand
   Baptists, and was presented to Charles II., July 26, 1660. It contains
   twenty-five Articles. [1645]

   III. The 'Orthodox Creed' was published in 1678, by the General
   Baptists of Oxfordshire and the parts adjacent. It makes a near
   approach to Calvinism, with a view to unite the Protestants in the
   fundamental articles against the errors of Rome. [1646]

   of the Free-will Baptists issued from their Printing Establishment at
   Dover, New Hampshire.


   The American General Baptists are called Free-will Baptists or Free
   Baptists. They trace their origin to Benjamin Randall (1749-1808), who
   was converted by one of the last sermons of Whitefield at Portsmouth,
   New Hampshire, Sept. 28, 1770. He was at first a Congregationalist, but
   in 1776 he united himself with a regular Baptist church in South
   Berwick, Maine, and entered the ministry. In 1780 he organized, in New
   Durham, New Hampshire, a Baptist church, which became the nucleus of a
   new denomination, holding the doctrines of conditional election, free
   will, and open communion. In government it is congregational.

   In 1827 the Free-will Baptists organized a General Conference in New
   England, and opened correspondence with the Arminian Baptists in
   England and North Carolina.

   Their Confession of Faith, together with a directory of discipline, was
   prepared by order of the General Conference of 1832, approved 1834,
   revised by a committee in 1848, 1865, and 1868. It is the clearest and
   ablest exposition of the principles of the Free-will Baptists. [1647]

   HISTORICAL SKETCH.

   The Religious Society of Friends, as they call themselves--or Quakers,
   as they are usually called [1648] --originated in the Puritan commotion
   which roused all the religious energies of England.

   It was founded by George Fox (1624-1690), one of the oddest saints in
   Christendom, a self-taught and half-inspired man of genius, who was
   called by a higher power from the shepherd's staff to the evangelism of
   the baptism by fire and by the Spirit. In early youth he felt inclined
   to ascetic retirement, like the hermits of old. He was a thorough
   mystic, and desired to get at the naked truth without the obstruction
   of church, sacrament, ceremonies, theology, and ordinary study, except
   the Scriptures spiritually understood. He loved to commune with nature
   and nature's God, to walk in the inward light, to enjoy the indwelling
   Christ, and to receive inspirations from heaven. He spent much time in
   fasting and prayer, he wrestled with the devil, and passed through deep
   mental distress, doubt, and despondency. His moral character was beyond
   reproach--pure, truthful, unworldly, just, temperate, meek, and gentle,
   yet bold and utterly regardless of conventional usage and propriety. He
   began his public testimony in his twenty-third year, and traveled
   through England, Holland, and the American colonies, preaching and
   praying with pentecostal fervor and power, revealing hidden truths,
   boldly attacking pride, formality, and worldliness, and exhorting to
   repentance, humility, and mercy. He sometimes interrupted the clergymen
   at public service, and the lawyers in court, and warned them against
   the wrath to come. He was a stern ascetic, clad in leather, and wearing
   long hair. He addressed every body 'thou' or 'thee,' and sublimely
   ignored all worldly honors and dignities. [1649] He was nine times
   thrown into prison for breaches of the peace and blasphemy, and
   suffered much hardship and indignity with imperturbable temper; but
   towards the close of his meteoric career he enjoyed comparative rest.
   His 'Journal' gives an account of his labors, and is, in the language
   of Sir James Mackintosh, 'one of the most extraordinary and instructive
   narratives in the world.' Fox was providentially provided with the best
   aid in founding his society.

   Robert Barclay (1648-1690) was the apologist and theologian of the
   Quakers, the only one known to fame. Descended from a noble family in
   Scotland, and educated in Paris, he became a convert first to Romanism,
   then to Quakerism (1667). He had therefore the advantage of an
   experimental as well as theoretical knowledge of the Scotch Calvinistic
   and the Roman Catholic creeds. He made various missionary journeys in
   company with William Penn; he walked through the streets of Aberdeen in
   sackcloth and ashes, and was several times imprisoned, but spent his
   last years in peace on his estate of Ury.

   William Penn (1644-1718), the statesman and politician of the Quakers,
   and the founder of Pennsylvania, was the son of an admiral, and enjoyed
   the favor of James II. (his father's friend), which he used in the
   cause of justice and mercy. [1650] He himself was expelled for his
   religion from the University of Oxford and his father's house, and was
   twice imprisoned, but ably defended the liberty of conscience, and was
   acquitted. By his influence more than twelve hundred Quakers were set
   at liberty. In 1680 he obtained from the king, in payment of a claim of
   £16,000, an extensive tract of land west of the Delaware River, and
   organized a colony on the basis of perfect freedom of religion (1682).
   The city of Philadelphia, or brotherly love, became the chief asylum of
   persecuted Quakers, a century afterwards the cradle of American
   independence, and in 1876 the theatre of the most remarkable centennial
   ever celebrated by any nation. Penn was twice in America, but died in
   England. He made a treaty with the Indians, of which Voltaire said that
   it was the only treaty never sworn to and never broken. The United
   States government would have fared better with the aborigines of the
   country if it had followed the humane example of Roger Williams and
   William Penn.

   The Quakers, during the first forty years of their history, were more
   severely persecuted than any sect of Christians had ever been, with the
   exception of the Waldenses, and bore it with unflinching heroism. Their
   eccentricities and fanatical excesses, their utter disregard for the
   courtesies and conventionalities of civilized life, their fierce abuse
   of the national churches (or 'steeple-houses') and clergymen, their
   opposition to tithes, salary, the oath, and military service, provoked
   the combined hostility of magistrates, ministers, and people. Their
   places of worship were invaded by the populace armed with staves,
   cudgels, and pitchforks; the windows broken by stones and bullets;
   their religious services rudely interrupted by hallooing and railing;
   their property destroyed or sold; their persons ridiculed, buffeted,
   assailed with stones and filth, dragged by the hair through the
   streets, or thrown into loathsome prisons and punished as heretics and
   blasphemers.

   Cromwell, who had a tender feeling for all 'godly' radicals and
   enthusiasts, was rather pleased with George Fox, with whom he had an
   interview (1654); he allowed him to keep on his hat, and to speak about
   the mysteries of spiritual experience; and, although he disapproved his
   disorderly conduct, he pressed his hand and said, 'Come again to my
   house; if thou and I were together but an hour in every day, we should
   be nearer one to the other.' But Cromwell could not control the local
   magistrates and the rabble.

   Under Charles II. the Quakers fared much worse, and notwithstanding the
   influence of Penn upon James II., who favored them for political
   reasons in the interest of the Roman Catholics, they continued to
   suffer until the Act of Toleration, in 1689, or rather until 1696, when
   by a special Act of Parliament their solemn affirmation was recognized
   as equivalent to an oath.

   During the period from 1650 to 1689, according to the patient
   researches of their historian, Joseph Besse, no less than 13,258
   Quakers suffered fine, imprisonment, torture, and mutilation in
   England, Scotland, and Ireland, 219 were banished, and 360 perished in
   prisons, some almost literally rotting in pestilential cells.

   In New England they were not treated any better: 170 instances of hard
   usage are enumerated, 47 were banished, and 4 hanged (three men and one
   woman, Mary Dyer). In explanation, though not in justification, of this
   severity of the Puritan colony towards them, we should remember those
   offenses against public decency which led some Quaker men and women to
   invade churches during divine service, and to promenade the streets of
   Boston, Cambridge, and Salem in sackcloth and ashes, even in puris
   naturalibus, for 'a sign and wonder' (in imitation of Isa. xx. 2, 3),
   to symbolize the 'naked truth,' and to utter a prophetic 'testimony'
   against the 'hireling priests,' the tyrannical magistrates, and the
   wicked and perverse generation, warning them of the impending judgments
   of the Lord, who would come with fire and sword. [1651] Even Roger
   Williams, in his debate with the Quakers at Newport (1672), with all
   his liberality, condemned such conduct. [1652]

   Notwithstanding these persecutions, the Society of Friends spread
   rapidly, and numbered about 70,000 members towards the close of the
   seventeenth century. They afterwards diminished in England, but
   increased in America, though not as much as other denominations. On the
   Continent they had only a few adherents in Holland and Germany.

   The fanatical heat of the martyr period of the Quakers cooled down with
   the cessation of persecution. They became a sober, quiet, orderly, and
   peaceful community. The oddities which they still retain are perfectly
   harmless, and form an interesting chapter in the history of morals.
   Quakerism is not so much a new theology as a new mode of Christian
   life, representing the utmost simplicity in opposition to show,
   ornament, and amusement.

   QUAKER CONFESSIONS.

   The Quakers are more radical than the Independents and the Baptists.
   They utterly broke with historical Christianity, and reject its visible
   ordinances, which the Independents and the Baptists retained. They kept
   aloof from the Puritans, and would have nothing whatever to do with the
   national English or any other Church or sect in Christendom. They
   oppose all outward authority in religion, though it be the letter of
   the Bible itself.

   With such views they can not consistently recognize any binding
   standards of doctrine which might obstruct the freedom of
   interpretation of the divine Word under the direct illumination of the
   Spirit.

   Nevertheless, with all their radicalism, the Quakers retained the
   substance of the Christian faith, and, following the example of the
   early Christians, they set forth their tenets in a number of apologies
   against the misrepresentations of their enemies. The first 'Confession
   and Profession of Faith in God' was published by Richard Farnsworth in
   1658. Similar apologetic documents followed in 1659 and 1661 by George
   Fox the Younger, in 1662 by John Crook, in 1664 by William Smith, in
   1668 by William Penn, in 1671 by Whitehead and Perm, in 1698 by Penn
   and others, in 1671, 1675, and 1682 by George Fox. [1653]

   The ablest and most authoritative exposition of the belief of the
   Quakers is the 'Apology' of Robert Barclay, written in his quiet
   retreat in Ury, Scotland, 1675, and addressed to Charles II. It is his
   most elaborate work, and is still held in the highest estimation by the
   orthodox Friends. He pays the school-divinity the compliment that,
   although it takes up almost a man's whole life-time to learn, it
   'brings not a whit nearer to God, neither makes any man less wicked or
   more righteous.' 'Therefore,' he continues, 'hath God laid aside the
   wise and the learned and the disputers of this world, and hath chosen a
   few despicable and unlearned instruments as he did fishermen of old, to
   publish his pure and naked truth, and to free it of those mists and
   fogs wherewith the clergy hath clouded it.' Nevertheless, Barclay makes
   use of a considerable amount of learning--classical, patristic, and
   modern--for the defense of his views.

   The 'Catechism' of Barclay (written in 1673) treats in fourteen
   chapters of the doctrines of the Christian faith, and answers the
   questions in the language of the Bible, without addition or comment,
   evidently for the purpose of showing the entire harmony of the Quakers
   with the written Word of God. Their distinctive peculiarities are
   skillfully put into the question, and the Scripture passages are so
   selected as to confirm them. [1654] To the Catechism is added a brief
   'Confession of Faith,' in twenty-three Articles, which is almost
   entirely composed of Scripture passages.

   THE DISTINCTIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE FRIENDS.

   The Friends are few in number, but honorably distinguished for their
   philanthropy, their consistent advocacy of religious freedom and the
   universal rights of men, their zeal in behalf of prison reform, the
   abolition of slavery and war. In private and social life they excel in
   simplicity, honesty, neatness, temperance, self-control, industry, and
   thrift. Their oddities in dress and habits are the shadows of virtues.

   In theology and religion they are on the extreme border of Protestant
   orthodoxy, and reject even a regular ministry and the visible
   sacraments; yet they strongly believe in the supernatural and the
   constant presence and power of the Holy Spirit. They hold the
   essentials of the evangelical faith, the divine inspiration and
   infallibility of the Scriptures (though they disparage the letter and
   the human means of interpretation), the doctrine of the Trinity (in
   substance, though not in name), [1655] the incarnation, the divinity of
   Christ, the atonement by his blood, the regeneration and sanctification
   by the Spirit, everlasting life and everlasting punishment. And while
   they deny the necessity of water baptism and the Lord's Supper as a
   participation of the elements of bread and wine, and regard such rites
   as a relapse into the religion of forms and shadows, they believe in
   the inward substance or invisible grace of the sacraments, viz., the
   baptism of the Spirit and fire, and the vital communion with Christ by
   faith. They belong to the supernaturalistic line of Protestant
   dissenters, while the Socinians and Unitarians tend in the opposite
   rationalistic direction.

   Several of the peculiar views and practices of the Quakers were
   anticipated by Carlstadt, the Zwickau Prophets, the Mennonites, and
   especially by Caspar von Schwenkfeld, a pious and retiring nobleman of
   Silesia (born 1490, banished 1548, d. 1561 at Ulm). Schwenkfeld
   embraced and preached the doctrines of the Lutheran Reformation with
   zeal till 1524, when he adopted, as by a higher revelation, a peculiar
   view of the Lord's Supper, explaining the words of institution to mean,
   My body is this bread, i.e., spiritual nourishment for the soul. [1656]
   He also taught the deification of Christ's flesh, and opposed
   bibliolatry and all outward ecclesiasticism. A small remnant of his
   sect that was banished from Germany still survives in the eastern
   counties of Pennsylvania. [1657] There is, however, no historical
   connection between George Fox and these predecessors. His views were
   entirely his own. The history of the Roman Catholic Church furnishes a
   parallel in the quietism of Miguel de Molinos (1627-1698), who taught
   that Christian perfection consists in the sweet repose of all the
   mental faculties in God, and in indifference to all the actions of the
   body. He was condemned as a heretic by Pope Innocent XI. (1687), and
   shut up for life in a monastic prison.

   Quakerism is a system of mystic spiritualism. It is the only organized
   sect of mystics in England and America. The strong practical
   common-sense of the English race is constitutionally averse to mystic
   tendencies. Quakerism is an extreme reaction against ecclesiasticism,
   sacerdotalism, and sacramentalism. It demonstrates the paramount
   importance of the spirit in opposition to the worship of the letter;
   the superiority and independence of the inward and invisible in
   opposition to the overestimate of the external and visible; and the
   power of silence against the excess of speech.

   Christianity undoubtedly is spirit and life, and may exist under
   different forms, or if necessary without form, like the spirit in the
   disembodied state. But the normal condition is a sound spirit in a
   sound body, and while God is independent of his own ordinances, we are
   bound to them. The Quakers make the exception the rule, but by the law
   of reaction formalism takes revenge. Their antiformalism becomes itself
   a stereotyped form, and their peculiar hats and coats are as
   distinctive as the clerical surplice and gown. When they leave their
   Society they usually join the Episcopal Church, the most formal among
   the Protestant denominations.

   THE INNER LIGHT.

   The ruling principle of Quakerism is the universal inner light. [1658]
   It is also called the seed, the Word of God, the gift of God, the
   indwe1ling Christ. This is not to be confounded with reason or
   conscience, or any natural faculty of man. [1659] It is supernatural
   and divine in its origin; it is a direct illumination of the mind and
   heart by the Spirit of God for the purpose of salvation. It is the
   light of the Logos, which shines 'in darkness' and 'lighteth every man
   that cometh into the world,' [1660] It is Christ himself dwelling in
   man as the fountain of life, light, and salvation. It is the primary
   source of all religious truth and knowledge. It opens the sense of
   spiritual mysteries; it convinces and converts; it gives victory over
   sin, and brings joy and peace. It is communicated to men without
   distinction of race or religion or education, not indeed in the same
   measure, but in a degree sufficient to save them if they obey it, and
   to condemn them if they reject it. 'The grace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared to all men.' [1661] A day of merciful
   visitation comes to every human being at least once in his life, and
   marks a critical turning-point which determines his character in this
   world and his eternal fate in the world to come. To many the voice from
   heaven speaks often.

   Cornelius was, under the divine influence of that light before the
   arrival of Peter and the hearing of the gospel. Socrates traced his
   better impulses to the divine monitor in his breast, who from childhood
   checked his evil passions without coercion. [1662] The savage Indians
   of North America followed the light when, after having been long
   engaged in war, they sacrificed a spotless white dog to the Great
   Spirit and threw their tomahawks into the lake. [1663]

   If Christ died for all men, his benefits must in some way be offered to
   all. He is the personal Light of the whole world, which shines into all
   parts of the human family backward to Adam and forward to the end of
   time. As many are sinners without ever having heard of Adam and the
   fall, so many are partakers of Christ without any external knowledge of
   him or the Scriptures. Else idiots, infants, and the saints who died
   before Christ's advent could not be saved. Historical knowledge can not
   save without experimental knowledge, but experimental knowledge may
   save without historical knowledge.

   The inner light agrees with the teaching of the Bible, though not
   confined to its letter. It is the true interpreter of the Bible, which
   without it remains a sealed book. It holds in this respect the same
   position which the Roman Catholic Church assigns to unwritten
   tradition, with this important difference, that tradition is an
   outward, objective authority, and confined to the visible Church, while
   the inner light is subjective, and shines upon all men.

   Quakerism thus boldly breaks through the confines of historical
   Christianity and the means of grace, indefinitely expands the sphere of
   revelation, and carries the saving power of Christ, even in this
   present life, into the regions of heathen darkness. It must
   consistently regard all virtuous and pious heathen as unconscious
   Christians, who, like the Athenians of old, 'unknowingly' worship an
   'unknown God.' Justin Martyr, the first Christian philosopher, advanced
   the idea that the 'Logos spermaticos,' i.e., the Eternal Word of God,
   before his incarnation, scattered the divine seed of truth and
   righteousness among the Greeks as well as the Jews. Zwingli taught the
   salvation of many heathen and of all children dying in infancy. But
   these were isolated private opinions; the doctrinal standards of the
   orthodox Churches--Greek, Latin, and Protestant--know of no Christ and
   no salvation outside of Christendom and without the written or preached
   gospel. The Quakers teach the absolute universality, not indeed of
   salvation, but of the offer and the opportunity of salvation.

   This doctrine is the corner-stone of their system. [1664] It is the
   source of their democracy, their philanthropy, their concern for the
   lowest and most neglected classes of society, their opposition to
   slavery, war, and violence, their meekness under suffering, their
   calmness and serenity of temper. But the same doctrine explains also
   their comparative disregard of the written Scriptures, the visible
   Church, the ministry, the means of grace, the forms of worship, and
   their indifference to heathen missions. There is, however, more
   recently among orthodox Friends a growing disposition to aid in the
   circulation of the Bible, the work of foreign missions, and to
   associate with evangelical Christians of other Churches.

   BARCLAY'S THESIS.

   Barclay reduces the doctrinal system of the Friends to fifteen
   propositions or theological theses, which are briefly as follows:
   [1665]

   1. The Foundation of Knowledge.--The height of happiness is in the true
   knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ (John xvii. 3).

   2. Immediate Revelation.--This comes from the Son of God (Matt. xi. 27)
   through the testimony of the Spirit.

   This is the inner light which has already been sufficiently explained.

   3. The Holy Scriptures.--They contain the revelations of the Spirit of
   God to the saints. They are a declaration of the fountain, but not the
   fountain itself; they are the secondary rule of faith and morals,
   subordinate to the Spirit from which they derive all their excellency
   and certainty (John xvi. 13).

   4. The Condition of Man after the Fall.--All men are by nature fallen,
   degenerated, and spiritually dead, but hereditary sin is not imputed to
   infants until they make it their own by actual transgression.
   Socinianism and Pelagianism are rejected, but also the doctrine of the
   'Papists and most Protestants,' that a man without the grace of God may
   be a true minister of the gospel.

   5. Universal Redemption by Christ.--God wills all men to be saved;
   Christ died for all men; the light is sent to every man for salvation,
   if not resisted.

   On this point the Quakers side with Lutherans and Arminians against
   Calvinists, but go far beyond them.

   6. Objections to the universality of redemption refuted.

   7. Justification.--Man is regenerated and justified when he receives
   the inner light. It is not by our works that we are justified, but by
   Christ who is both the gift and the giver, and the cause producing the
   effects in us.

   The Quakers closely connect justification with sanctification, and
   approach the Roman view, with this difference, that they teach
   justification in our works, not on account of our works. Penn
   distinguishes between legal justification, that is, the forgiveness of
   past sins through Christ, the alone propitiation, and moral
   justification or sanctification, whereby man is made inwardly just
   through the cleansing and sanctifying power and Spirit of Christ.

   8. Perfection.--Man may become free from actual sinning, and so far
   perfect; yet perfection admits of growth, and there remains a
   possibility of sinning. [1666]

   The Methodists have substantially adopted this view, and call it entire
   consecration or perfect love.

   9. Perseverance.--Those who resist the light, or disobey it after
   receiving it, fall away (Heb. vi. 4-6; Tim. i. 6); but it is possible
   in this life to attain such a stability in the truth from which there
   can be no total apostasy.

   This is a compromise between Calvinism and Arminianism.

   10. The Ministry.--Those and only those are qualified ministers of the
   gospel who are illuminated and called by the Spirit, whether male or
   female, whether learned or unlearned. These ought to preach without
   hire or bargaining (Matt. x. 8), although they may receive a voluntary
   temporal support from the people to whom they administer in spiritual
   things.

   11. Worship.--It consists 'in the inward and immediate moving and
   drawing of the Spirit, which is neither limited to places or times or
   persons.' All other worship which man appoints and can begin and end at
   his pleasure is superstition, will-worship, and idolatry.

   All forms and even sacred music are excluded from the naked
   spiritualism of Quaker worship. It is simply reverent communion of the
   soul with God, uttered or silent. I once attended a Quaker meeting in
   London whose solemn silence was more impressive than many a sermon. I
   felt the force of the word, 'There was silence in heaven for the space
   of half an hour.' At another meeting I heard one man and several women
   exhort and pray in a tremulous voice and with reverential awe, as if in
   the immediate presence of the great Jehovah. All depends upon the power
   of the Holy Spirit.

   12. Baptism.--It is 'a pure and spiritual thing, a baptism of the
   Spirit and of fire,' by which we are purged from sin (1 Pet. iii. 21;
   Rom. vi. 4; Col. ii. 12; Gal. iii. 27; John iii. 30). Of this the
   water-baptism of John was a figure commanded for a time. The baptism of
   infants is a human tradition, without Scripture precept or practice.

   13. The Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ is likewise inward
   and spiritual, of which the breaking of bread at the last Supper was a
   figure. It was used for a time, for the sake of the weak, even by those
   who had received the substance, as the washing of feet and the
   anointing of the sick with oil was practiced; all which are only the
   shadows of better things. (John vi. 32-35; 1 Cor. x. 16, 17.)

   This doctrine of the sacraments is a serious departure from the
   universal consensus of Christendom and the obvious intention of our
   Saviour. It can only be accounted for as a protest against the opposite
   extreme, which substitutes the visible sign for the invisible grace.

   14. The Power of the Civil Magistrate.--It does not extend over the
   conscience, which God alone can instruct and govern, provided always
   that no man under pretense of conscience do any thing destructive to
   the rights of others and the peace of society. All civil punishments
   for matters of conscience proceed from the spirit of Cain the murderer.

   Here the Quakers, like the Baptists, commit themselves most
   unequivocally to the doctrine of universal religious liberty as a part
   of their creed.

   15. Salutations and Recreations.--Under this head are forbidden the
   taking off the hat to a man, the bowings and cringings of the body, and
   'all the foolish or superstitious formalities' which feed pride and
   vanity and belong to the vain pomp and glory of this world; also all
   unprofitable and frivolous plays and recreations which divert the mind
   from the fear of God, from sobriety and gravity. Penn said of Fox that
   he was 'civil beyond all forms of breeding.'

   The Apology of Barclay is a commentary on these propositions.

   Note.--The Hicksites.--In the year 1827 a schism took place among the
   Friends in Philadelphia, and extended to most of the yearly meetings in
   America, but had no influence in England. Since then the Quakers are
   divided into 'orthodox' Quakers and 'Hicksites,' although the latter
   refuse to be called by any other name but that of 'Friends' or
   'Quakers.' The founder of this rupture was Elias Hicks, born in
   Hempstead, Long Island, March 19, 1768; died in Jericho, N.Y., Feb. 27,
   1830.

   He took strong ground against slavery, and abstained from all
   participation in the fruits of slave labor. He was for a long time an
   acceptable preacher, but early in the present century he advocated
   radical Unitarian and other heterodox doctrines, which shocked the
   majority of the Quakers and led to commotion, censure, and schism. The
   first separation took place in the Yearly Meeting at Philadelphia, and
   then a similar one in New York, Baltimore, Ohio, and Indiana. Many
   espoused the cause of Hicks, in the interest of religious liberty and
   progress, without indorsing his heretical opinions on the articles of
   the Trinity, the divinity, and the atonement of Christ.

   The extreme left of the Hicksites broke off in 1853 in Chester County,
   Pa., and organized a separate party under the name of Progressive
   Friends. They opened the door to all who recognize the equal
   brotherhood of the human family, without regard to sex, color, or
   condition, and engage in works of beneficence and charity. They
   disclaim all creeds and disciplinary authority, and are opposed to
   every form of ecclesiasticism.

   The Hicksite movement drove the orthodox Quakers more closely to the
   Scriptures, and called forth several official counter-demonstrations.

   On the 'Hicksite' Quakers, see Elias Hicks, Journal of his Life and
   Labors, and his Sermons, Phila. 1828; and Janney (a Hicksite), History
   of the Society of Friends, Vol. IV.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1648] The name 'Friends' designates a democratic brotherhood in
   Christ. The name 'Quakers' is sometimes wrongly derived from the
   warning of Fox to the magistrates 'to quake for fear' and 'to tremble
   at the Word of the Lord' (Isa. lxvi. 2). It comes rather from their own
   tremulous utterance of emotion in prayer and exhortation. Barclay
   (Apology, p. 310, on Prop. XI.) speaks of the trembling motion of the
   body under the power of the truth, by which Quakers are exercised as in
   the day of battle, and says: 'From this the name of Quakers, i.e.,
   Tremblers, was first reproachfully cast upon us; which, though it be
   none of our choosing, yet in this respect we are not ashamed of it, but
   have rather reason to rejoice therefore, even that we are sensible of
   this power that hath oftentimes laid hold of our adversaries and made
   them yield unto us.' Allinson says (1.c. p. 668): 'The epithet Quakers
   was given in derision, because they often trembled under an awful sense
   of the infinite purity and majesty of God, and this name, rather
   submitted to than accepted by them, has become general as a
   designation.'

   [1649] 'The Lord forbade him,' says Sewel, 'to put off his hat to any
   man, high or low; he was required to Thou and Thee every man and woman
   without distinction, and not to bid people Good-morrow or Good-evening;
   neither might he bow or scrape his leg to any one.'

   [1650] The charges of Lord Macaulay against Penn's integrity have been
   repelled by W. E. Forster (William Penn and Thomas Babington Macaulay,
   1850) and J. Paget (Edinburgh, 1858).

   [1651] Palfrey, History of New England, Vol. II. pp. 461-485; Dexter,
   As to Roger Williams,' etc., pp. 124 sqq. One such case of Oriental
   teaching by signs occurred also in England, and is mentioned by Fox
   himself in his Journal: 'The Lord made one to go naked amongst you, a
   figure of thy nakedness, and as a sign, before your destruction cometh,
   that you might see that you were naked and not covered with the truth.'
   See Stoughton, The Church of the Commonwealth, p. 360.

   [1652] He wrote a curious book, George Fox digg'd out of his Burrowes,
   etc., which was republished by the Narragansett Club, 1872, with an
   introduction by Prof. Diman. Comp. Dexter, 1.c. p. 138.

   [1653] On these earlier confessions, see Evans, pp. xii. sqq.

   [1654] Comp. Ch. XI., concerning Baptism, and Bread and Wine. I will
   select, as a specimen, the questions on the Lord's Supper:

   'Ques. I perceive there was a baptism of water, which was John's
   baptism, and is therefore by John himself contradistinguished from
   Christ's: was there not likewise something of the like nature appointed
   by Christ to his disciples, of eating bread, and drinking wine, in
   remembrance of him?

   'Ans. For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto
   you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took
   bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat;
   this is my body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
   After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,
   This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as oft as ye
   drink it, in remembrance of me. 1 Cor. xi. 23-25.

   'Ques. How long was this to continue?

   Ans. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show
   the Lord's death till he come. 1 Cor. xi. 26.

   'Ques. Did Christ promise to come again to his disciples?

   'Ans. And I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you. Jesus
   answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words,
   and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
   abode with him. John xiv. 18, 23.

   'Ques. Was this an inward coming?

   'Ans. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me,
   and I in you. John xiv. 20.

   'Ques. But it would seem this was even practiced by the church of
   Corinth, after Christ was come inwardly: was it so, that there were
   certain appointments positively commanded, yea, and zealously and
   conscientiously practiced by the saints of old, which were not of
   perpetual continuance, nor yet now needful to be practiced in the
   Church?

   'Ans. If I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye ought
   also to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that
   you should do as I have done to you. John xiii. 14, 15.

   'For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no
   greater burthen than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats
   offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from
   fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well: Fare
   ye well. Acts xv. 28, 29.

   'Is any man sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church,
   and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
   Lord. James v. 14.

   'Ques. These commands are no less positive than the other; yea, some of
   them are asserted as the very sense of the Holy Ghost, as no less
   necessary than abstaining from fornication, and yet the generality of
   Protestants have laid them aside, as not of perpetual continuance: but
   what other Scriptures are there, to show that it is not necessary for
   that of bread and wine to continue?

   'Ans. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness
   and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Rom. xiv. 17.

   'Let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of an
   holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days. Wherefore if ye
   be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though
   living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch not, taste
   not, handle not: which all are to perish with the using), after the
   commandments and doctrines of men? Col. ii. 16, 20-22.

   'Ques. These Scriptures are very plain, and say as much for the
   abolishing of this, as to any necessity, as aught that can be alleged
   for the former: but what is the bread then, wherewith the saints are to
   be nourished?

   'Ans. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
   gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true
   bread from heaven,' etc.

   Then follows the whole section, John vi. 32-35, 48-58.

   [1655] I can not find the term Trinity in Fox's Journal nor in
   Barclay's Apology, but both teach very clearly that Christ is God, and
   that the Holy Spirit is God, that all knowledge of the Father comes
   through the Son, and all knowledge of the Son through the Holy Spirit.

   [1656] He understood soma and haima to be the subject, and touto the
   predicate.

   [1657] See Erbkam, Geschichte der protest. Sekten im Zeitalter der
   Reformation, pp. 357 sqq., and Kadelbach, Geschichte K. v.
   Schwenkfeld's, etc. (Lauban, 1861). The German Catechism of the
   Schwenkfeldians of Pennsylvania, by Christopher Schultz, Senior
   (translated by Daniel Rupp, Stippackville, Pa. 1863), teaches
   Schwenkfeld's peculiar doctrine of the Lord's Supper, but not the
   deification of Christ's flesh.

   [1658] Penn (in the Preface to Fox's Journal, p. xiv.) calls it 'the
   fundamental principle which is as the corner-stone of their fabric,
   and, to speak eminently and properly, their characteristic or main
   distinguishing point or principle, viz., the light of Christ within, as
   God's gift for man's salvation. This is as the root of the goodly tree
   of doctrines that grew and branched out from it.' Fox's Journal is full
   of it; see the list of passages in Vol. II. pp. 551 sq. of the 6th ed.
   (Leeds, 1836).

   [1659] Barclay (Apol. p. 74) rejects the errors of Pelagians and
   Socinians, and teaches the corruption of human nature in consequence of
   the fall, but maintains, in opposition to Augustine, Luther, and
   Calvin, that God does not impute sin to infants until they commit
   actual transgression. Gurney says (l.c. p. 6): 'Never did they [the
   Quakers] dare to consider this light as a part of fallen man's corrupt
   nature; never did they hesitate to ascribe it to the free and universal
   grace of God through Christ Jesus our Lord.'

   [1660] John i. 9. The difference in the construction of erchomenou eis
   ton kosmon does not affect the universality, which is sufficiently
   sustained by panta anthropon but the question is whether John means the
   light of reason or the light of grace, and in the latter case whether
   it is sufficient for salvation or merely preparatory to it. When Fox,
   on his second visit to Cromwell (in 1656), quoted this passage, he was
   met with the objection that John meant 'the natural light;' but he
   'showed him the contrary--that it was divine and spiritual, proceeding
   from Christ, the spiritual and heavenly man' (Journal, Vol. I. p. 383).

   [1661] Titus ii. 11. Other passages quoted by Quakers for their
   favorite doctrine are, Gen. vi. 3; Deut. xxx. 14; Rom. x. 3; Luke ii.
   10; Rom. ii. 14, 15; Col. i. 23; Eph. v. 13; Acts x. 35.

   [1662] Apol. Soc. He calls his daimonion (in Jowett's translation) 'a
   voice which comes to me and always forbids me to do something which I
   am going to do, but never commands me to do any thing, and which stands
   in the way of my being a politician.' He goes on to say that in
   politics he would have perished long ago without doing any good either
   to the people or to himself. The case of Socrates is not mentioned by
   Barclay, but by Gurney, p. 42: 'When Socrates, as compared with his
   fellow-countrymen, attained to an eminent degree of disinterestedness,
   integrity, justice, and charity; when he obeyed the counsels of that
   unknown monitor who so frequently checked him in the hour of
   temptation; when he bore so clear a testimony to virtue as to be
   persecuted to death for virtue's sake--on what scriptural grounds can
   any man deny that he was made a partaker, to a certain degree, of a
   divine influence?'

   [1663] Gurney, p. 42.

   [1664] Hence their name, 'Professors of the Light,' 'Friends of Light,'
   'Children of Light.'

   [1665] See them in full, Vol. III. p. 749.

   [1666] Penn (Preface to Fox's Journal, p. xiv.) says that the Friends
   'never held a perfection in wisdom and glory in this life, or from
   infirmities or death, as some have with a weak or ill mind imagined and
   insinuated against them.'

   HISTORICAL SKETCH.

   We must distinguish between the old Bohemian and Moravian Brethren who
   belonged to the Slavonic race, and the new Moravians who are chiefly
   German or of German descent. The connecting link between the two was
   the celebrated educator, John Amos Comenius (1592-1671), the Jeremiah
   of the former, and the John the Baptist of the latter, who, hoping
   against hope for the resurrection of the Bohemian Unitas Fratrum,
   nearly crushed to death by persecution, left behind him their order of
   discipline, and made provision for the ordination of two bishops, that
   through them the succession might be preserved in a quiescent state,
   until, in 1735, it was transferred to the renewed Church.

   The new Moravian Church [1667] took its origin from the remnant (the '
   Hidden Seed') of the Bohemian and Moravian Brethern, to whom Count
   Zinzendorf (1700-1760), under the guidance of a special providence,
   gave an hospitable refuge on his estates at Berthelsdorf, in Upper
   Lusatia, Saxony. The asylum was called Herrnhut (the Lord's
   Protection), and became the mother church and the centre of the
   denomination.

   The little colony of immigrants from Moravia soon increased, by the
   accession of German families of the pietistic school of Spener, to the
   number of three hundred souls. It was organized on the basis of the
   Ratio Disciplinæ of Comenius. David Nitschmann was consecrated the
   first bishop by Daniel Ernst Jablonsky (court chaplain in Berlin) and
   Christian Sitkov, the surviving bishops of the old succession (March
   13, 1735). This consecration was performed secretly in the presence of
   only two members of the Bohemian congregation in Berlin, for the sole
   purpose of sending ordained ministers to the distant missions and
   colonies. It was not intended to establish an episcopal form of
   government, separate and distinct from the national Lutheran Church,
   but this separation was the natural consequence. The second bishop was
   Count Zinzendorf himself, who gave up his office at the Saxon court and
   his worldly prospects to devote himself entirely to the Church of his
   own planting. [1668] With all his eccentricities he was one of the
   purest and most remarkable men in the history of Christianity, a
   religious and poetic genius, and a true nobleman by nature and divine
   grace as well as by rank. He had but one all-absorbing passion--Christ
   and him crucified. [1669] From his childhood, when he used to write
   letters to his beloved Saviour, this sacred fire burned in him, and
   continued to burn till he was called to see him face to face. He early
   conceived the idea, by planting in the spirit of Spener a true Church
   in the nominal Church, to reform the Church at home, and to carry the
   gospel to the heathen. We may call him the German Wesley; he was an
   organizer like John Wesley, and a true hymnist like his brother
   Charles. The Oxford Methodists started with a legalistic type of piety,
   but they received a new inspiration from the childlike, cheerful,
   serene, and sublime trust in God which characterized the Moravians with
   whom they came in contact.

   The patriarchs of Moravianism--Zinzendorf, Nitschmann, and
   Spangenberg--like the patriarchs of Methodism, labored in both
   hemispheres at a time when the stagnant State Churches of Germany and
   England cared little or nothing for their children in America. They
   founded Bethlehem (1741) and Nazareth in Pennsylvania, and other
   colonies which remain to this day. Zinzendorf endeavored to unite the
   other German denominations and sects in Pennsylvania into one Church,
   but in vain. [1670]

   The Moravian brotherhood is par excellence a missionary society at home
   and abroad. It has but few regularly organized congregations scattered
   in Christian lands, but in an age of indifferentism and rationalism
   they were like cities of refuge and oases in the wilderness, with fresh
   fountains and green pastures for multitudes who flocked to them for
   refreshment. [1671] They are still holding up the model of living
   congregations of real Christians. Besides, they have mission stations,
   called Diaspora (1 Pet. i. 1), for those who wish to derive spiritual
   benefit from them without severing their connection with the
   established Churches. These half-members may be compared to the Jewish
   proselytes of the gate as distinguished from the proselytes of
   righteousness. The Moravians, however, are free from the spirit of
   proselytism, and endeavor to promote peace and union among the
   Christians at home. But they are aggressive abroad, and concentrate
   their energies on foreign missions. Their chief glory lies in the
   extraordinary zeal and self-denial with which, since 1732, they have
   labored for the conversion of the most ignorant and degraded heathen in
   Greenland, Labrador, among the American Indians, and the African
   negroes and Esquimaux, at a time when orthodox Protestant Christendom
   had not yet awoke to a sense of its long-neglected duty. To the small
   band of Moravians belongs the first place of honor in the work of
   foreign missions.

   DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP.

   The Moravian congregations in Germany are select communities of
   converted Christians, ecclesiæ in ecelesia, separate and distinct from
   the national Churches and the vanities of the surrounding world. [1672]
   They have a strict discipline, but they are free from gloomy
   asceticism, and cherish a cheerful and trustful piety with love for
   music and social refinement. Their educational institutions attract
   pupils from all directions.

   The form of government is a kind of Episcopal Presbyterianism, under
   the supreme legislative power of synods, and an executive
   administration of an elective board of bishops and elders, called the
   'Unity's Elders' Conference.' The bishops ordain deacons and
   presbyters: they represent the whole Unitas Fratrum, are official
   members of the synods, and have usually a seat in the governing boards.
   They claim an unbroken succession, but lay no stress on it, and fully
   recognize the validity of Presbyterian orders.

   The home churches are divided into three provinces, Continental,
   British, and American. In 1857 these were declared independent in local
   and provincial affairs, but they continue to be united in doctrine and
   the work of foreign missions.

   In worship, the Moravians combine liturgical and extemporaneous prayer.
   At all the liturgical services music forms a prominent feature. Their
   liturgy and hymn-book are of a superior order. They have greatly
   enriched the treasures of German hymnology, and produced also one of
   the best English hymnists in James Montgomery (1771-1854), 'the Cowper
   of the nineteenth century.' Love-feasts are held preparatory to the
   communion, in imitation of the ancient Agapæ. Foot-washing was formerly
   practiced, but has been discontinued since the beginning of the present
   century. The former use of the lot in connection with marriage has been
   practically abandoned; and in connection with the appointment of
   ministers it has been restricted or is left discretional.

   DOCTRINES.

   The Moravians acknowledge no exclusive and compulsory symbols. They are
   essentially unionistic, and seek union in harmony of spirit, life, and
   worship, rather than in a logical statement of doctrine. [1673] Their
   most authoritative creed is the Easter Litany, which dates from 1749,
   and is still used annually in all Moravian churches, but as an act of
   worship, not as a formula for subscription. [1674] They have always
   laid the chief stress on the atoning death of Christ, and the personal
   union of the soul with him, but more in a devotional and practical than
   doctrinal way. Christ crucified and living in them is the all in all of
   their religion, their only comfort in life and death; but they have not
   formulated any particular theory of the atonement or of the unio
   mystica. They prefer the chiaroscuro of mystery and the personal
   attachment to Christ to all scientific theology.

   Historically and nationally, they are more nearly related to the
   Lutheran denomination than to any other. They sustain to it a relation
   similar to that which the Wesleyans sustain to the Church of England.
   They professed from the start their agreement with the Augsburg
   Confession. Spangenberg, the exponent of their doctrinal system, begins
   the preface to his Idea Fidei Fratrum with the declaration that his
   book is no new confession, but that the Confessio Augustana of 1530 is
   and shall remain their confession.

   But we should remember that this indorsement of the doctrinal articles
   of the Augsburg Confession, though no doubt sincere, was partly a
   matter of policy and necessity to secure toleration in Lutheran
   countries. [1675] It had no force outside of Germany and Scandinavia,
   and even there no subscription to this document was ever required.
   [1676] The Moravians never adopted the other Lutheran symbols, least of
   all the Formula of Concord, which strict Lutherans regard as a
   legitimate development of the Augustana. They never wished to be
   considered, nor were they recognized as Lutherans, but were violently
   assailed by them for their alleged doctrinal latitudinarianism and
   various excesses during their early history. Even the Pietists for a
   period made common cause with their orthodox enemies against the new
   sect, though less on doctrinal grounds. The Moravians claim to be the
   legitimate descendants and heirs of the Bohemian Brethren, who were
   closely connected with the Waldenses, and had their own Confessions and
   Catechisms before and after the Reformation. They admitted to their
   communion Lutherans, Pietists, Calvinists, Anglicans, without inquiring
   into their creed, if only they were devout Christians. In England they
   were recognized by Parliament, with the concurrence of the bench of
   bishops, as 'an ancient Episcopal Church' (1749), and allowed to settle
   in the American colonies. They also freely associated with Wesleyans.
   They were the advocates of a conservative evangelical union of three
   chief types of doctrine [1677] --the old Moravian or Bohemian, the
   Lutheran, and the Reformed--living in brotherly harmony as a true
   unitas fratrum, and having their common centre in Christ. They rise
   above the boundaries of nationality and sect, and represent a real
   catholicity or universalism of creed with Christ as the only
   fundamental article. 'I know of no other foundation,' says Zinzendorf,
   'but Christ, and I can associate with all who build on this
   foundation.' He was at one time even open to a project of union with
   the Greek and Latin Churches and all sorts of Christian sects, but he
   learned that the union here below must be spiritual and inward.

   It is a remarkable fact that the great German theologian,
   Schleiermacher, was cradled in the Moravian community, and conceived
   there his love for Christian union and personal devotion to Christ,
   which guided him through the labyrinth of speculation and skepticism,
   and triumphed on his death-bed. He shook almost every dogma of
   orthodoxy, and was willing, if necessary; to sacrifice all, if he could
   only retain a perfect and sinless Saviour.

   Zinzendorf's theology and piety passed through a process of
   development--first a sound evangelical stage (1723-1742), then a period
   of sickly sentimentalism (1743-1750), and, last, a period of
   purification and reconstruction (1750-1760). [1678] These phases are
   reflected in the history of his followers. Encouraged by his own
   unguarded language, in poetry and prose, about the luxurious reveling
   in the wounds of the Lamb, [1679] and the personal intimacy with the
   Saviour, they ran into wild and dangerous excesses of an overheated
   imagination. As is often the case in the history of religious
   enthusiasm, the spirit was about to end in the flesh. [1680] But
   Zinzendorf himself, honestly confessing his share of responsibility,
   recalled his followers from the abyss to the purity and simplicity of
   the gospel.

   The purified and matured system of the Moravians is best exhibited in
   Spangenberg's Idea Fidei, which occupies a similar position among them
   as Melanchthon's Loci in the Lutheran Church. It is also set forth from
   time to time in the Synodical Results. The Synod of 1869 issued the
   following summary of such doctrines as are deemed most essential to
   salvation:

   '1. The doctrine of the total depravity of human nature: that there is
   no health in man, and that the fall absolutely deprived him of the
   divine image.

   '2. The doctrine of the love of God the Father, who has "chosen us in
   Christ before the foundation of the world," and "so loved the world
   that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life."

   ' 3. The doctrine of the real godhead and the real manhood of Jesus
   Christ: that God, the Creator of all things, was manifested in the
   flesh, and has reconciled the world unto himself; and that "he is
   before all things, and by him all things consist."

   '4. The doctrine of the atonement and satisfaction of Jesus Christ for
   us: that he "was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for
   our justification;" and that in his merits alone we find forgiveness of
   sins and peace with God.

   '5. The doctrine of the Holy Ghost and the operations of his grace:
   that it is he who works in us the knowledge of sin, faith in Jesus, and
   the witness that we are children of God.

   '6. The doctrine of the fruits of faith: that faith must manifest
   itself as a living and active principle, by a willing obedience to the
   commandments of God, prompted by love and gratitude to him who died for
   us.

   'In conformity with these fundamental articles of faith, the great
   theme of our preaching is Jesus Christ, in whom we have the grace of
   the Lord, the love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost.
   We regard it as the main calling of the Brethren's Church to proclaim
   the Lord's Death, and to point to him, "as made of God unto us wisdom,
   and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."' [1681]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1667] Also called the Unitas Fratrum, the United Brethren, the
   Moravian Brethern; in German, Brüdergemeine, or Herrnhuter. They must
   not be confounded with the Methodist 'United Brethren in the United
   States,' founded by Rev. William Otterbein in 1800.

   [1668] It is an interesting fact that Frederic William I., king of
   Prussia, advised Zinzendorf to get the old Moravian Episcopal
   ordination, and that Zinzendorf conferred on the subject with Bishop
   Jablonsky, and with his friend, the Archbishop of Canterbury (John
   Potter).

   [1672] The Moravian settlements in the United States were organized on
   the same exclusive principle, but have recently been thrown open to
   other people.

   [1673] Burkhardt (in Herzog, Vol. XVIII. p. 589) says: 'Die
   Brüdergemeinde stellt nie ein äusserlich formulirtes Bekenntniss nach
   aussen hin auf, das sie von anderen evangelischen Glaubensgenossen
   trennen könnte. Sie wird es und kann es nie thun, denn nicht Abschluss
   und Scheidung, sondern Union ist ihr Princip. Aber nur jene wahre und
   positive Union auf Grund der heiligen Schrift und der lebendigen
   Herzens-Erfahrung, die allein die Herzen vereinigt.' Bishop Schweinitz
   says {Manual, p. 95): 'The Renewed Church of the Brethren has no
   Confession of Faith as such, that is, no document bearing this name.'

   [1674] See the Moravian Litany in Vol. III. p. 793.

   [1675] After ten years' banishment from Saxony, Zinzendorf secured in
   1748 recognition of his congregation as Augsburgische
   Religionsverwandte (Addicti Augustanæ Conf.)--a title under which the
   Reformed, or Calvinists, were included in the Treaty of Westphalia.

   [1676] Manual, p. 95: 'This acknowledgment, according to the
   declaration of the General Synod, does not bind the conscience of any
   member, much less is it of any weight in those provinces of the Unity
   where the Augsburg Confession has no other value than as being the
   creed of one (the Lutheran) among many Churches enjoying equal rights'
   (Synod. Results of 1857, p. 96).

   [1677] Lehrtropen (tropoi paideias), as Zinzendorf called them. He
   meant different educational ways of God adapted to the varieties of
   national and individual character. The Lutheran type prevailed among
   the Moravians in Saxony, the Reformed in Holland and England. The
   Moravian type furnished the historical base and a peculiar element in
   discipline rather than doctrine.

   [1678] See especially Plitt and Burkhardt.

   [1679] Or 'Lambkin,' Lämmlein, as the favorite phrase was. The
   side-wound was made especially prominent.

   [1680] Bishop Schweinitz thus describes this period (Moravian Manual,
   pp. 35 sq.): 'The relation between Christ and his Church was described
   in language more highly figurative, and under images more sensuous,
   than any thing found even in the Song of Solomon. A mania spread to
   spiritualize, especially the marriage relation, and to express holy
   feelings in extravagant terms. Hymns abounded, treating of the passion
   of Jesus, apostrophizing the wound in his side, degrading sacred things
   to a level with the worst puerilities, and pouring forth sentimental
   nonsense like a flood; while services, in themselves devotional and
   excellent, were changed into occasions for performances more in keeping
   with the stage of a common theatre than with the sanctity of the house
   of God. In short, fanaticism rioted among ministers and people, and
   spread from Herrnhaag and Marienborn to other churches both on the
   Continent of Europe and in England. Those in America escaped, or were
   but slightly affected. This continued for about five years, reaching
   its climax in 1749. It is possible that immoralities of life may have
   occurred in single instances, although there are no positive proofs of
   this; the great majority of the Brethren, however, were preserved from
   such extremes.' Similar antinomian excesses occurred in the Moravian
   congregations in England (1751), and turned Wesley and Whitefield
   against their old friends, whom they charged with neglecting to preach
   the law either as a schoolmaster or as a rule of life, with irreverent
   sentimentalism and superstitions fopperies. See Tyerman, Life of John
   Wesley, Vol. II. pp. 95 sqq. (Harper's ed.).

   CHARACTER OF METHODISM.

   Methodism is the most successful of all the younger offshoots of the
   Reformation. In one short century it has become one of the largest
   denominations in England, and the largest in the United States, with
   missionary stations encircling the globe.

   The founders were admirably qualified for their work, and as well
   fitted together as the Reformers. John Wesley was one of the greatest
   preachers and organizers, and in the abundance of his labors perhaps
   the most apostolic man that England ever produced. As a revivalist of
   practical religion he may be called the English Spener, as an organizer
   the Protestant Ignatius Loyola. His brother Charles occupies, next to
   Watts, the first place in English hymnology, and sang Methodism into
   the hearts of the people. Whitefield, the orator and evangelist,
   kindled a sacred fire in two hemispheres which burns to this day. Their
   common, single, and sole purpose was to convert sinners from the
   service of Satan to the service of God, by means of incessant
   preaching, praying, and working. For this end they were willing to
   spend and be spent, to be ridiculed, reviled, pelted and hooted by
   mobs, maltreated by superiors, and driven from the church into the
   street; for this they would in another age have suffered torture,
   mutilation, and death itself as cheerfully as the Puritans did before
   them. The practical activity of these great and good men was equaled
   only by that of the Reformers in the theoretic sphere. During the fifty
   years of his itinerant ministry, John Wesley traveled 'a quarter of a
   million of miles, and preached more than forty thousand sermons.'
   [1682] Charles Wesley composed over six thousand religious poems,
   [1683] in the study, in the pulpit, on horseback, in bed, and in his
   dying hour. [1684] Whitefield, besides traveling through England,
   Ireland, and Scotland, made seven evangelistic voyages to America,
   turning the ship into a church, and 'preached in four-and-thirty years
   upwards of eighteen thousand sermons, many of them to enormous crowds,
   and in the teeth of brutal persecution.' [1685] A day before his death
   he preached his last sermon of nearly two hours' length in the open
   air, 'weary in the work, but not of the work' of his Lord. Fletcher
   labored in a more restricted sphere, as Vicar of Madely, but just as
   faithfully and devotedly, visiting his people and the poor ignorant
   colliers early and late, in rain and snow, studying intensely, living
   all the while on bread and cheese or fruit, and exhibiting an angelic
   type of character, so that Wesley, from a personal acquaintance of more
   than thirty years, gave him the testimony that 'he never heard him
   speak an improper word or saw him do an improper action,' and that he
   never knew a man 'so inwardly and outwardly devoted to God, so
   unblamable in every respect.' [1686] The pioneers of American Methodism
   were animated by the same zeal. Bishop Asbury, 'in the forty-five years
   of his American ministry, preached about 16,500 sermons, or at least
   one a day, and traveled about 270,000 miles, or 6000 a year, and
   presided in no less than 224 annual conferences, and ordained more than
   4000 preachers.' [1687] He was ordained bishop (1784) when the number
   of American Methodists fell below 15,000, and he died (1816) when it
   exceeded 211,000, with more than 700 itinerant preachers.

   Methodism owes its success to this untiring zeal in preaching the
   gospel of the new birth and a 'full and free salvation' to the common
   people, in churches, chapels, and the open air, and to its peculiar
   methods and institutions--itinerancy, missionary bishops, presiding
   elders, lay helpers, class-meetings, camp-meetings, conferences, and
   systematic collections. Methodism, as Dr. Chalmers characterized it, is
   'Christianity in earnest.' It works powerfully upon the feelings; it
   inspires preachers and members with enthusiasm; it gives every man and
   woman too a distinct vocation and responsibility; it 'keeps all at work
   and always at it,' according to Wesley's motto; it knows nothing of
   churches without ministers, or ministers without charges, as long as
   there are sinners to be converted in any corner of the globe. Methodism
   is better organized than any other Protestant denomination, and
   resembles in this respect the Church of Rome and its great monastic
   orders. It is a powerful rival of that Church. It has an efficient
   machinery with an abundance of steam, and is admirably adapted for
   pioneer work in a new country like America. It is a well-disciplined
   army of conquest, though not so good an army of occupation, since it
   allows so many 'to fall away from grace,' not only temporarily, but
   even 'totally and finally.' Till 1872 the laity was excluded from
   participation in Church government (and is so still in England), but
   was compensated by a large liberty in the sphere of worship, in
   class-meetings, band-meetings, love-feasts, which tend to develop the
   social and emotional element in religion.

   METHODISM AND PURITANISM.

   Methodism forms the third great wave of the Evangelical Protestant
   movement in England, and represents the idea of revival. The
   Reformation destroyed the power of the papacy. Puritanism aimed at a
   more thorough Reformation in Church and State, and controlled for a
   time the civil and religious life of the nation. Methodism kept aloof
   from politics, and confined itself to the sphere of practical religion.
   Puritanism was animated by the genius of Calvinism; Methodism, in its
   main current, by the genius of Arminianism. Both made a deep and
   lasting impression upon the national Church from which they proceeded,
   and moulded the character of American Christianity. The Methodist
   revival checked the progress of skepticism and infidelity which had
   begun to set in with deism. It brought the life and light of the gospel
   to the most neglected classes of society.

   If evangelical Christianity to-day has a stronger hold on the
   Anglo-Saxon race in both hemispheres than on any other nation, it is
   chiefly due to the influence of Puritanism and Methodism.

   RELATION TO THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.

   Methodism is a daughter of the Church of England, and was nursed in the
   same University of Oxford which, a century later, gave rise to the
   Tractarian school in the opposite direction towards Rome. The 'Holy
   Club' of the fourteen Oxford students associated for prayer, holy
   living, and working, began, like Dr. Pusey and his friends, with a
   revival of earnest, ascetic, and ritualistic High-Churchism, and
   received the name 'Methodists' for its punctual and methodical habits
   of devotion. Wesley was at first so exclusive an Episcopalian that he
   shrank from street-preaching and lay-preaching, and, at least on one
   occasion, even rebaptized Dissenters. But his contact with the
   simple-hearted, trustful, and happy German Moravians (Peter Böhler,
   Nitschmann, and Spangenberg) whom he met on his voyage across the
   Atlantic, in the Colony of Georgia, and after his return, led to his
   second 'conversion,'  which took place May 24, 1738, and imparted to
   his piety a cheerfully evangelical and, we may say, a liberal
   Broad-Church character. [1688]

   He now entered upon his independent evangelistic career, yet with no
   idea of forming a separate denomination. His object was simply to
   revive experimental piety within the limits of the Anglican Church, as
   Spener and Francke had done before within the Lutheran Confession in
   Germany. Although badly treated by bishops and other clergy, he had no
   quarrel with the authorities in Church or State, but only with sin and
   Satan. His aim was to build the city of God and to save souls within
   the establishment, if possible; without it, if necessary. He performed
   indeed some uncanonical acts which led ultimately to secession, but he
   did it from necessity, not from choice. He never made common cause with
   Dissenters. He lived and died in the Church of his fathers. His brother
   Charles was even more conservative, and took great offense at his
   violation of the canons.

   Had the Church of England been as wise and politic as the Church of
   Rome, she would have encouraged and utilized the great revival of the
   eighteenth century for the spread of vital Christianity at home and
   abroad, and might have made the Wesleyan society an advocate of her own
   interests as powerful as the order of the Jesuits is of the Papacy.
   Now, after a century of marvelous success, the founder of Methodism is
   better appreciated, and has been assigned (1876) a place of honor among
   England's mighty dead in Westminster Abbey.

   The English Wesleyans continue to hold a middle position between the
   Established Church and the Dissenters proper, but tend latterly more to
   Free-Churchism.

   AMERICAN METHODISM.

   In the United States the Methodists were made an independent
   organization with an episcopal form of government by Wesley's own act.
   As a Tory and a believer in political non-resistance, he at first wrote
   against the American 'rebellion,' but accepted the providential result;
   and, considering himself as a 'Scriptural Episcopos,' he ordained, on
   the second day of September, 1784, two presbyters (Richard Whatcoat and
   Thomas Vasey) and one superintendent or bishop, viz., the Rev. Thomas
   Coke, LL.D. (a presbyter of the Church of England), for his American
   mission, which then embraced 83 traveling preachers and 14,988 members.
   [1689] This was a bold and an irregular act, but a master-stroke of
   policy, justified by necessity and abundant success. [1690]

   Bishop Coke, assisted by the Rev. P. W. Otterbein, of the German
   Reformed Church, ordained, according to Wesley's direction, Francis
   Asbury to the office of joint superintendent, and twelve others to the
   office of presbyters, at the first General Conference held in Baltimore
   (Dec. 27, 1784). These were the first Protestant bishops in America,
   with the exception of Dr. Samuel Seabury, who was consecrated a few
   weeks before (Nov. 14, 1784), at Aberdeen, as bishop of the Protestant
   Episcopal diocese in Connecticut. [1691] In a short time the society,
   thus fully organized, overtook older denominations, and kept pace with
   the rapid progress of the young republic.

   The separation from the mother Church of England was complete, but her
   blood still flows in the veins of Methodism and shows itself in a
   half-way assent to her doctrinal standards (as far as they admit of an
   Arminian interpretation), to her liturgy (as far as it does not
   encourage sacerdotalism and ritualism or interfere with the freedom of
   worship), and to her episcopacy (as based upon expediency, and not on
   the divine right of succession).

   BRANCHES OF METHODISM.

   The Methodist Christians in England and America are divided into a
   number of distinct ecclesiastical organizations--the 'Wesleyans,' the
   'Methodist Episcopal Church,' the 'Primitive Methodists,' the
   'Primitive Wesleyans of Ireland,' the 'Bandroom Methodists,' the
   'Methodist Protestant Church,' the 'Welsh Calvinistic Methodists,' the
   'Free Methodist Church,' the 'African (Bethel and Zion) Methodist
   Episcopal Church,' etc. To the Methodist family belong also the
   'Evangelical Association' (or 'Albright's Brethren,' so called from
   Jacob Albright, a Pennsylvania German, who founded this society in
   1800), and the 'United Brethren in Christ' (founded by Philip William
   Otterbein, a German Reformed minister, d. in Baltimore, 1813).

   The great parent body, however, are the Wesleyans in England and the
   Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. They far outnumber all
   the other branches put together. The Methodist Episcopal Church was
   divided in 1844 on the question of slavery into 'the Methodist
   Episcopal Church' (North), and 'the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,'
   but measures have been inaugurated (1876) for reuniting them. Similar
   schisms for the same cause rent other Churches before the civil war,
   but have been healed or will be healed, since the war has removed the
   difficulty. The Roman Catholic, and next to it the Protestant Episcopal
   Church, owing to their conservatism, were least affected by the
   disturbing question of slavery, and remained intact.

   The differences between the various branches of Methodism refer to the
   episcopate, the relative powers of the bishops and the general
   conference, lay representation, and other matters of government and
   discipline which do not come within the scope of this work. The
   doctrinal creed is the same in all, with the exception of the
   Whitefieldian Methodists, who are Calvinists, while all the rest are
   Arminians.

   [1688] 'At the first,' says Dr. Rigg ('Contemporary Review' for 1876,
   pp. 656 sq.), 'with Wesley faith had meant the intellectual acceptance
   of the creeds, together with the submission of the will to the laws and
   services of the Church. . . . Until he met with Böhler, he had not
   embraced, scarcely, it would seem, had conceived the idea of faith as
   being, in its main element, personal trust and self-surrender, as
   having for its central object the atonement of Jesus Christ, and as
   inspired and sustained by the supernatural aid and concurrence of the
   Holy Spirit. . . . Wesley confessed that Böhler's teaching was true
   gospel teaching. . . . Here ended his High-Church stage of life. Here
   began his work as an evangelist and Church revivalist. All dates from
   his final acceptance of Böhler's teaching as to the nature of faith.'
   Dr. Stevens says (Centenary, p. 31): 'Methodism is indebted to
   Moravianism for not only some of the most important features of its
   moral discipline, but for the personal conversion of both the Wesleys.'
   But Wesley was converted before as much so as Luther was when he
   entered the convent of Erfurt several years before he experienced his
   second or evangelical conversion to the doctrine of justification by
   faith alone. On the other hand, some of the Oxford Tractarians were
   converted over again, or backward, when they joined the Church of Rome.

   [1689] The first Methodist society in America was formed in 1766, in
   the city of New York, among a few Irish emigrants, by Philip Embury, a
   local preacher, and by his cousin, Mrs. Barbara Heck, a true 'mother in
   Israel.' Hence Methodism celebrated its centenary in 1866 with great
   festivities.

   [1690] He also ordained a few presbyters for Scotland and England to
   assist him in administering the sacraments, on the plea that the
   regular clergy often refused to admit his people to the Lord's table.
   At the Conference of 1788 he consecrated (according to Samuel
   Bradburn's statement) one of his preachers as a superintendent or
   bishop. He had long before been convinced by Stillingfleet's 'Irenicon'
   and Lord King's 'Primitive Church' that bishops and presbyters were
   originally one order, and that diocesan episcopacy was not founded on
   divine right. In a letter to his brother Charles (1785) he calls the
   uninterrupted episcopal succession 'a fable which no man ever did or
   can prove.'--Rigg, 1.c. p. 669. For a full discussion of Wesley's
   ordination acts, see Stevens, History of Methodism, Vol. II. pp. 209
   sqq., and Tyerman, John Wesley. Vol. III. pp. 426 sqq.

   [1691] Bishop White, of Pennsylvania, was not consecrated by the
   Archbishop of Canterbury until Feb. 4, 1787, the consecration being
   delayed and nearly frustrated by certain impediments.

   § 110. Methodist Creeds.

   The American Methodists have three classes of doctrinal standards.

   1. The Twenty-five Articles of Religion. [1692] They were prepared by
   John Wesley, from the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England
   (together with an abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer), for the
   American Methodists, and were adopted by the Conference in Baltimore,
   1784, with the exception of Article XXIII., which recognizes the United
   States as 'a sovereign and independent nation,' and which was adopted
   in 1804. These articles are now unalterably fixed, and can neither be
   revoked nor changed. [1693]

   2. John Wesley's Sermons and Notes on the New Testament. They are
   legally binding only on the British Wesleyans, but they are in fact as
   highly esteemed and as much used by American Methodists, and constitute
   the life of the denomination. When eighty-one years of age (Feb. 28,
   1784), Wesley, in his famous Deed of Declaration, which is called the
   Magna Charta of Methodism, bequeathed the property and government of
   all his chapels in the United Kingdom (then 359 in number) to the
   'Legal Hundred,' i.e., a conference of one hundred of his traveling
   preachers and their successors, on condition that they should accept as
   their basis of doctrine his Notes on the New Testament and the four
   volumes of Sermons which had been published by him or in his name in or
   before 1771. [1694] These sermons are fifty-eight in number, and cover
   the common faith and duties of Christians, [1695] but contain at the
   same time the doctrines which constitute the distinctive creed of
   Methodism. [1696] The Notes on the New Testament are for the most part
   a popular version of Bengel's Gnomon.

   3. The Book of Discipline and several Catechisms, one published in
   1852, another in 1868 (by Dr. Nast), are at least secondary standards
   for the American Methodists.

   The distinctive features of the Methodist creed are not logically
   formulated, like those of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. It allows
   a liberal margin for further theological development. John Wesley,
   though himself an able logician and dialectician, sought Christianity
   more in practical principles and sanctified affections than in orthodox
   formulas, and laid greater stress on the oecumenical consensus which
   unites than on the sectarian dissensus which divides the Christians.
   The General Rules, or recognized terms of membership, for the origina1
   Methodist 'societies' (not churches), are ethical and practical, and
   contain not a single article of doctrine. They require 'a desire to
   flee the wrath to come and be saved from sin,' and to avoid certain
   specific vices.

   Nevertheless Methodists claim to have more doctrinal harmony than many
   denominations which impose a minute creed. There is a Methodist system
   of doctrine and a Methodist theology, however elastic they may be. But
   there is a difference of opinion among their standard writers as to the
   degree of originality and completeness of this system and its relation
   to other confessions. We may distinguish an American and an English
   view on the subject.

   An ingenious attempt has recently been made to raise the Methodist
   creed to the importance and dignity of a fourth confession or
   symbolical system alongside of the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, and
   the Calvinistic, and far above them. According to Dr. Warren,
   Catholicism makes salvation dependent upon a meritorious co-operation
   of man with God, and is essentially pagan; Calvinism makes salvation
   depend exclusively on the eternal decree and free grace of God, and
   views Christianity from the stand-point of the Old Testament;
   Lutheranism derives salvation from the personal relation of man to the
   means of grace (the Word and Sacraments), and views Christianity from
   the stand-point of justification by faith alone; Methodism makes
   salvation exclusively dependent upon man's own free relation to the
   illuminating, renewing, and sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit,
   and represents the stand-point of Christian perfection. Calvin retains
   the Christians under the dispensation of the Father, Luther under the
   dispensation of the Son, Wesley leads them into the dispensation of the
   Spirit. The first confines salvation to the favorite number of the
   elect; the second binds it to the baptismal font, the altar, and the
   pulpit; the third offers it freely to all. Calvin's ideal Christian is
   a servant of God, Luther's a child of God, Wesley's a perfect man in
   the full stature of Christ. [1697]

   English Methodists claim for their system a humbler position, and
   represent it, in accordance with the intention of the founders, as a
   liberal evangelical modification of the Anglican creed, with some
   original doctrines to which they attach great importance. [1698]

   (who is now President of the Methodist University in Boston) wrote this
   able book (which is as yet, 1876, unfinished) while in Germany, and
   under the stimulus of the generalizing theories of some German divines.
   Zinzendorf had made a somewhat similar distinction between the
   Lutheran, Reformed, and Moravian types of doctrine (Lehrtropen), but
   comprehended them all in his brotherhood. James Martineau, from the
   Unitarian point of view, represents Luther, Calvin, and Wesley as the
   representatives of the orthodox gospel in three dialects (Studies of
   Christianity, London, 1873, pp. 399 sq.).

   [1698] Professor William B. Pope, of Didsbury College, Manchester, one
   of the leading Wesleyan divines, makes the following statement
   concerning the creed of the English Methodists (in the Introduction to
   his translation of Winer's Comparative View of the Doctrines and
   Confessions of the various Communities of Christendom, Edinb. 1873, pp.
   lxxvi.-lxxviii.): 'It may be said that English Methodism has no
   distinct articles of faith. At the same time it is undoubtedly true
   that no community in Christendom is more effectually hedged about by
   confessional obligations and restraints. Reference has been made to the
   distinction of creeds, confessions, and standards. Methodism combines
   the three in its doctrinal constitution after a manner on the whole
   peculiar to itself. Materially if not formally, virtually if not
   actually, implicitly if not avowedly, its theology is bound by the
   ancient oecumenical Creeds, by the Articles of the English Church, and
   by comprehensive standards of its own, the peculiarity of its
   maintenance of these respectively having been determined by the
   specific circumstances of its origin and consolidation--circumstances
   with which it is not our business here to enter. In common with most
   Christian Churches it holds fast the Catholic Symbols; the Apostolical
   and Nicene are extensively used in the Liturgy, and the Athanasian, not
   so used, is accepted so far as concerns its doctrinal type. The
   doctrine of the Articles of the Church of England is the doctrine of
   Methodism. This assertion must, of course, be taken broadly, as subject
   to many qualifications. For instance, the Connection has never avowed
   the Articles as its Confession of Faith; some of those Articles have no
   meaning for it in its present constitution; others of them are
   tolerated in their vague and doubtful bearing, rather than accepted as
   definitions; and, finally, many Methodists would prefer to disown any
   relation to them of any kind. Still the verdict of the historical
   theologian, who takes a comprehensive view of the estate of
   Christendom, in regard to the history and development of Christian
   truth, would locate the Methodist community under the Thirty-nine
   Articles. He would draw his inference from the posture towards them of
   the early founders of the system; and he would not fail to mark that
   the American branch of the family, which has spread simultaneously with
   its European branch, has retained the Articles of the English Church,
   with some necessary modifications, as the basis of its Confession of
   Faith. Setting aside the Articles that have to do with discipline
   rather than doctrine, the Methodists universally hold the remainder as
   tenaciously as any of those who sign them, and with as much consistency
   as the great mass of English divines who have given them an Arminian
   interpretation. That is to say, where they diverge in doctrine from the
   Westminster Confession, Methodism holds to them; while this Confession
   rather expresses their views on Presbyterian Church government. It may
   suffice to say generally on this subject, that so far as concerns the
   present volume [of Winer], every quotation from the English Articles
   may stand, if justly interpreted, as a representative of the Methodist
   Confession.

   'Finally, we have the Methodist Standards, belonging to it as a society
   within a Church, which entirely regulate the faith of the community,
   but are binding only upon its ministers. Those Standards are to be
   found in certain rather extensive theological writings which have none
   of the features of a Confession of Faith, and are never subscribed or
   accepted as such. More particularly, they are some Sermons and
   Expository Notes of John Wesley; more generally, these and other
   writings, catechisms, and early precedents of doctrinal definition;
   taken as a whole, they indicate a standard of experimental and
   practical theology to which the teaching and preaching of its ministers
   are universally conformed. What that standard prescribes in detail it
   would be impossible to define here. . . . Suffice that the Methodist
   doctrine is what is generally termed Arminian, as it regards the
   relation of the human race to redemption; that it lays great stress
   upon the personal assurance which seals the personal religion of the
   believer; and that it includes a strong testimony to the office of the
   Holy Spirit in the entire renewal of the soul in holiness, as one of
   the provisions of the covenant of grace upon earth. It may be added,
   though only as an historical fact, that a rigorous maintenance of this
   common standard of evangelical doctrine has been attended by the
   preservation of a remarkable unity of doctrine throughout this large
   communion.'

   Dr. Whedon, the editor of the 'Methodist Quarterly Review,' in a notice
   of Pope's Winer (October No., 1873, pp. 680 sqq.), enters 'his firm,
   fraternal protest against being recorded before the eyes of the world
   as training under the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England,'
   and says, 'The entire body of Methodists of the United States no more
   hold the Thirty-nine Articles, doctrinally, than they do the
   Westminster Confession. They reject a large share of both for the same
   reason, namely, that they are, in their proper interpretation,
   Calvinistic. Nor does this Confession express their views on
   Presbyterian Church government: for the Confession affirms the divine
   obligation of Presbyterianism, and the large body of American
   Methodists believe in the right of a voluntary episcopacy.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 111. Analysis of Arminian Methodism

   THE SEMI-ANGLICAN DOCTRINES.

   The Twenty-five Articles represent the doctrines which Methodism holds
   in common with other evangelical Churches, especially with the Church
   of England. They are an abridgment of the Thirty-nine Articles of
   Religion, with a view to simplify and to liberalize them. Wesley
   omitted the political articles, which apply only to England, and those
   articles which are strongly Augustinian, especially Article 17, of
   Predestination (which teaches unconditional election to salvation and
   the perseverance of the elect), Art. 13, of Works before Justification
   (which are said to have the nature of sin), and Art. 8 (which indorses
   the three Creeds). On the other hand, Art. 10, of Free Will, which
   teaches (with Augustine, Luther, and Calvin) the natural inability of
   man to do good works without the grace of God, is literally retained
   (Meth. Art. 8).

   Minor doctrinal changes were made in Art 2 (Art. 2), where the clauses
   'begotten from everlasting of the Father,' and 'of her [the Virgin's]
   substance,' are omitted (either as doubtful or lying outside of a
   creed); [1699] in Art. 9 (7), where the last clauses, which affirm the
   continuance of original sin in the regenerate, are left out (as
   inconsistent with Wesley's view of perfection); in Art. 16 (12), where
   'sin after justification' is substituted for 'sin after baptism' (to
   avoid the doctrine of baptismal regeneration); in Art. 25 (16), of the
   Sacraments, where the words 'sure witnesses and effectual,' before
   'signs of grace,' are stricken out (which betrays a lowering of the
   doctrine of the Sacraments); in Art. 34 (22), where 'traditions of the
   Church' are changed into 'Rites and Ceremonies.'

   These omissions and changes are significant, and entirely consistent
   with Methodism, but they are negative rather than positive. Wesley
   eliminated the latent Calvinism from the Thirty-nine Articles, but did
   not put in his Arminianism, nor his peculiar doctrines of the Witness
   of the Spirit and Christian Perfection, leaving them to be derived from
   other documents of his own composition.

   THE ARMINIAN DOCTRINES.

   The five points in which Arminius differed from the Calvinistic system
   are clearly and prominently brought out in Wesley's writings, though
   mostly in the form of popular and practical exposition and exhortation.
   He put the name of Arminius on his periodical organ, and struck the
   keynote to the Arminian tone of Methodist preaching. The Arminian
   features of Methodism are, freedom of the will (taken in the sense of
   liberum arbitrium, or power of contrary choice) as necessary to
   responsibility; self-limitation of divine sovereignty in its exercise
   and dealings with free agents; foreknowledge as preceding and
   conditioning foreordination; universality of redemption; resistibility
   of divine grace; possibility of total and final apostasy from the state
   of regeneration and sanctification.

   Calvinism and Methodism agree in teaching man's salvation by God's free
   grace, in opposition to Pelagianism and Semipelagianism. But Calvinism
   traces salvation to the eternal purpose of God, and confines it to the
   elect; Methodism makes it dependent on man's free acceptance of that
   grace which is offered alike to all and on the same terms. Calvinism
   emphasizes the divine side, Methodism the human. [1700] Herein
   Methodism entirely agrees with Arminianism, and is even more
   emphatically opposed to the doctrines of absolute predestination,
   limited atonement, and the perseverance of saints than Arminius was,
   who left the last point undecided.

   Wesley began the thunder against the imaginary horrors and blasphemies
   of Calvinism which has since resounded from innumerable Methodist
   pulpits. He defines predestination to be 'an eternal, unchangeable,
   irresistible decree of God, by virtue of which one part of mankind are
   infallibly saved, and the rest infallibly damned; it being impossible
   that any of the former should be damned, or that any of the latter
   should be saved;' and then he goes on to show that this doctrine makes
   all preaching useless; that it makes void the ordinance of God; that it
   tends directly to destroy holiness, meekness, and love, the comfort and
   happiness of religion, zeal for good works, and the whole Christian
   revelation; that it turns God into a hypocrite and deceiver; that it
   overturns his justice, mercy, and truth, and represents him 'as worse
   than the devil, more false, more cruel, and more unjust.' 'This,' he
   says, 'is the blasphemy clearly contained in the horrible decree of
   predestination, and for this I abhor it (however I love the persons who
   assert it).' To this decree he sets over the other decree, 'I will set
   before the sons of men life and death, blessing and cursing; and the
   soul that chooseth life shall live, as the soul that chooseth death
   shall die.' The elect are all those who 'suffer Christ to make them
   alive.' [1701]

   The vehemence of this opposition to the doctrine of predestination must
   be explained in part from the subjective and emotional nature of
   Methodist piety, which exposes it much more to an antinomian abuse of
   this doctrine than is the case with the calm intellectual tendency, of
   Calvinism.

   On the other hand, however, the 'evangelical' Arminianism of Wesley, as
   it is called, differs from the Dutch Arminianism, as developed by
   Episcopius and Limborch, and inclines as much towards Augustinianism as
   Arminianism inclines towards Pelagianism. In this respect it resembles
   somewhat the Lutheran anthropology of the Formula of Concord, though it
   differs altogether from its christology and sacramentalism.

   1. Methodism holds a much stronger view of original sin than
   Arminianism, and regards it not simply as a disease or weakness, [1702]
   but as a total depravity that unfits man altogether for co-operation
   with the grace of God towards conversion. Wesley, Fletcher, and Watson
   describe this natural corruption in consequence of Adam's fall in the
   darkest colors, almost surpassing the descriptions of Augustine,
   Luther, and Calvin; but they deny the personal responsibility of Adam's
   posterity for his fall or the doctrine of original guilt; and herein
   they agree with the Arminians and the Quakers.

   2. Methodism teaches the freedom of will as a gift of prevenient grace,
   which is given to every man as a check and antidote to original sin;
   while Arminianism, with its milder view of the fall, allows man a
   certain freedom of will in a weakened state as an inherent and
   inherited power of nature.

   3. Methodism lays greater stress on the subjective experience of
   conversion and regeneration. Its preaching is essentially radical
   evangelistic revival preaching, which rouses the sinner to a sense of
   his danger, and the paramount necessity of an immediate, sudden, and
   radical change of heart and life.

   THE ORIGINAL DOCTRINES OF METHODISM.

   To these modifications of Arminianism must be added a few doctrines
   which Methodism claims as its own contributions to the better
   understanding of the Christian system.

   1. The doctrine of the universality of divine grace, not only in its
   intention, but in its actual offer. Herein Methodism resembles the
   Quaker doctrine of universal light. It is assumed--on the ground of
   Paul's parallel between the first and second Adam (Rom. v.)--that all
   men are born into an order of saving grace, as well as into an order of
   sin. Adam brought a universal seed of death, but Christ brought a
   universal seed of life, which is available for all who do not reject
   it. [1703] For by virtue of the universal atonement, man, though born
   in sin, is held guiltless until he arrives at the point of personal
   responsibility.

   While Romanism and Lutheranism save those only who are brought into
   contact with the Church and the Sacraments, Calvinism those only who
   are elect from eternity, Methodism brings the opportunity of salvation
   to all men in this present life, though in different forms and degrees,
   so that they are actually saved if they do not incur the guilt of
   rejecting salvation by unbelief. Hence all children are saved if they
   die before they commit actual sin. Though born in sin, they are not
   held guilty before the age of responsible agency. They are saved by the
   same power of the universal atonement which saves adults; though there
   is a difference of opinion as to the regeneration of infants before
   death. [1704] On the same ground all heathen may be saved who do not
   neglect their opportunities. Ability and opportunity are the measure of
   responsibility, and God requires no more from man than he empowers him
   to perform. Christ's atonement covers the deficiency of ability in the
   case of infants, and the deficiency of opportunity in the case of the
   heathen.

   Fletcher distinguishes three dispensations in this general economy of
   grace: the dispensation of the Father, embracing the heathen and
   Mohammedans, who know God only from his general revelation in nature,
   providence, and the conscience; the dispensation of the Son, for those
   who live within the limits of Christendom and the reach of the gospel;
   and the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, for those who have an
   experimental knowledge of the regenerating and sanctifying Spirit.
   Wesley, Watson, and Pope teach essentially the same view of the
   universality of grace.

   2. The next distinctive doctrine of Methodism is the Witness of the
   Spirit or the assurance of salvation (Rom. viii. 15, 16). It is a
   double and concurrent witness of God's Spirit and of our spirit
   concerning our justification. The former is objective and divine, and
   antecedes; the latter is subjective and human, and follows. The Holy
   Spirit bears testimony to our spirit that by faith we are the children
   of God. This testimony is immediate and direct, and follows the work of
   justification and regeneration. On the ground of this testimony the
   believer feels assured of his present acceptance with God, and has a
   hope of his final salvation, but he is at the same time guarded against
   carnal security by the fear of a total and final fall from grace. Hence
   there are so many backsliders, who constitute a special class among
   Methodists. [1705]

   Herein the Methodist doctrine differs from the Calvinistic doctrine of
   assurance which is based, not on subjective feeling, but on the divine
   promises and the unchangeable decree of God's election, and which
   covers not only the present state, but the whole process to its final
   completion, conditioned by the perseverance of saints as the final test
   of genuine conversion. [1706]

   3. The last and crowning doctrine of Methodism, in which the Quakers
   likewise preceded it, is Perfectionism. It is regarded as a mighty
   stimulus to progressive holiness, and forms the counterpart of the
   doctrine of apostasy, which acts as a warning against backsliding. It
   is derived from such passages as Matt. v. 48; Phil. iii. 15; Heb. vi.
   1; x. 14; 1 John iii. 6; v. 18. Methodist perfection is not a sinless
   perfection or faultlessness, which Wesley denied, [1707] but a sort of
   imperfect perfection, from which it is possible to fall again
   temporarily or forever. [1708] It is entire sanctification or perfect
   love (1 John ii. 5; iv. 12), which every Christian may and ought to
   attain in this present life. From this state all voluntary
   transgressions or sinful volitions are excluded, though involuntary
   infirmities may and do remain; in this state all the normal qualities
   are possessed and enjoyed in their fullness. As to the attainment of
   perfection, it comes according to the prevailing view from gradual
   growth in grace, according to others by a special act of faith. [1709]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1699] Emory, in his History of the Discipline, inserts the clause,
   'begotten of everlasting from the Father,' as adopted in 1784, but
   omitted in 1786 and in later editions, perhaps by typographical error.
   A Methodist correspondent (Rev. D. A. Whedon) suggests to me that
   Wesley may have made a distinction between the eternal Sonship and the
   eternal Generation, and may have maintained the former, but questioned
   the latter as referring to the manner rather than the fact. Prof. Pope,
   the latest Methodist writer on Dogmatics, avoids this question as
   belonging to the transcendental mysteries (Christ. Theol. p. 272).

   [1700] Dr. Warren, 1.c. p. 140, states the difference in an extreme
   form, which would subject Methodism to the charge of downright
   Pelagianism: 'Nach der Methodistischen Auffassung des
   Heilsverhältnisses Gottes und des Menschen hängt das Heil oder
   Nicht-Heil eines jeden Menschen lediglich von seinem eigenen freien
   Verhalten gegenüber den erleuchtenden, erneuernden und heiligenden
   Einwirkungen des heiligen Geistes ab. Verhält man sich gegenüber diesen
   Einwirkungen empfänglich, so wird man hier, und einst dort, selig
   werden; verschliesst man sein Herz gegen dieselben, so wird man hier,
   und auf ewig im Tode verbleiben. Mit dieser Grundanschauung hängen alle
   sonstigen Eigenthümlichkeiten des Methodismus, wie z. B. seine
   eigenthümliche Freiheitslehre, seine Betonung der Wirksamkeit des
   heiligen Geistes, seine Lehre von der christlichen Vollkommenheit, und
   dergleichen, eng zusammen. Seinem innersten Geist und Wesen nach ist er
   eine Auffassung des Christenthums vom Standpunkte der christlichen
   Vollkommenheit oder der völligen Liebe.'

   [1701] Sermon liv., on Free Grace (Rom. viii. 32), preached at Bristol.
   It follows immediately after the eulogistic funeral discourse on the
   Calvinistic Whitefield. His brother Charles wrote a polemical poem on
   'The Horrible Decree,' in which his poetic genius left him, as may be
   inferred from the following specimens:

   'O Horrible Decree,

   Worthy of whence it came!

   Forgive their hellish blasphemy,

   Who charge it on the Lamb.'

   'To limit Thee they dare,

   Blaspheme Thee to Thy face,

   Deny their fellow-worms a share

   In Thy redeeming grace.'

   In another poem, on 'Predestination,' he prays:

   'Increase (if that can be)

   The perfect hate I feel

   To Satan's Horrible Decree,

   That genuine child of hell;

   Which feigns thee to pass by

   The most of Adam's race,

   And leave them in their blood to die,

   Shut out from saving grace.'

   How infinitely superior to these polemical effusions is his genuine
   hymn:

   'Jesus, lover of my soul,'

   which a Calvinist may sing as heartily as a pious Methodist will join
   in his antagonist's (Toplady's):

   'Rock of Ages, cleft for me.'

   [1702] Episcopius calls the peccatum originis an infirmitas or
   calamitasor malum, but not a malum culpæ and malum poenæ. Limborch
   calls it malum naturale, not peccatum nostri respectu. See Winer, Comp.
   Symb. pp. 60 sqq.

   [1703] 'No man living,' says Wesley, 'is without some preventing grace,
   and every degree of grace is a degree of life. There is a measure of
   free will supernaturally restored to every man, together with that
   supernatural light which enlightens every man that cometh into this
   world.' 'That by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men (all
   born into the world) unto condemnation, is an undoubted truth, and
   affects every infant as well as every adult person. But it is equally
   true that by the righteousness of One, the free gift came upon all men
   (all born into the world--infants and adults) unto justification.' D.
   D. Whedon (Biblioth. Sacra, 1862, p. 258): 'Under the redemptive
   system, the man is born into the world, from Adam, a depraved being. It
   is as a depraved being that he becomes an Ego. But instantly after, in
   the order of nature, he is met by the provisions of atonement.' 'Every
   human being,' says Warren, 'has a measure of grace (unless he has cast
   it away), and those who faithfully use this intrusted gift will be
   accepted of God in the day of judgment, whether Jew or Greek, Christian
   or heathen. In virtue of Christ's mediation between God and the fallen
   race, all men since the first promise, Gen. iii. 15, are under an
   economy of grace, and the only difference between them as subjects of
   the moral government of God is that, while all have grace and light
   enough to attain salvation, some, over and above this, have more and
   others less' (Vol. I. pp. 146 sq.). Pope (pp. 239-248) distinguishes
   this doctrine from the Augustinian, Pelagian, Semipelagian, Tridentine,
   Lutheran, Calvinistic, and Arminian, and says that there is no doctrine
   which 'so irresistibly and universally appeals for its confirmation to
   the common conscience and judgment of mankind.'

   [1704] Dr. D. D. Whedon (Biblioth. Sacra, 1862, p. 258) remarks on this
   point: 'That the dying infant is saved, and saved by the atonement, we
   all agree. But his precise condition, as affected by the atonement,
   while a living infant, seems to be a somewhat undecided matter.
   Probably a large majority of the Methodist Episcopal Church have, for
   some time past, held, without much discussion, that the living infant
   was both unjustified and unregenerate, and yet upon his death he
   obtained both blessings. This making death the condition of
   justification and regeneration appears to many hardly logical, and not
   without danger. Mr. Wesley's earlier expressions of opinion indicated a
   holding of the churchly doctrine of baptismal regeneration in infancy.
   His later indications of opinion indicate that he held all infants to
   be members of the kingdom of heaven; and he also held that regeneration
   is a condition to membership in the kingdom of heaven; but he does not
   expressly draw the inference that all infants are regenerate. Fletcher
   maintained the doctrine both of infant justification and regeneration.
   Dr. Fisk held to infant justification. Our baptismal service first
   declares, in its Scripture lesson of infants, that "of such is the
   kingdom of God," and yet declares "that none can enter into the kingdom
   of God unless he be regenerate." But neither here is the inference
   expressly drawn. The subject is a matter of calm discussion, and
   perhaps the number of those holding the doctrine of infant regeneration
   has decidedly increased.'

   [1705] Comp. the three sermons of Wesley on the Witness of the Spirit
   (x.-xii.), Vol. I. pp. 85 sqq. He traced this doctrine to his contact
   with some Moravians on his voyage to Georgia (1735), whose childlike
   trust and serene cheerfulness led him to exclaim: 'I, who went to
   America to convert others, was never myself converted to God.' He meant
   conversion from legal bondage to evangelical freedom and a sense of
   assurance of pardon. He subsequently visited Count Zinzendorf and the
   Moravians in Germany to study their discipline (1739). Watson (Vol. II.
   p. 271) distinguishes four views on the testimony of the Spirit, and
   thus states his own, which agrees with Wesley's: 'It is twofold; a
   direct testimony or "inward impression on the soul, whereby the Spirit
   of God witnesses to my spirit that I am a child of God; that Christ
   hath loved me, and given himself for me, that I, even I, am reconciled
   to God" (Wesley's Sermons); and an indirect testimony, arising from the
   work of the Spirit in the heart and life, which St. Paul calls the
   testimony of our own spirit; for this is inferred from his expression,
   "And the Spirit beareth witness with our spirit, etc." This testimony
   of our own spirit, or indirect testimony of the Holy Spirit by and
   through our own spirit, is considered confirmatory of the first
   testimony.' Pope (p. 465): 'Assurance is the fruit, not the essence of
   faith. . . .Perfect faith must be assured of its object. . . . The
   internal assurance of faith is a privilege that all may claim and
   expect; seasons of darkness and depression and uncertainty are only the
   trial of that faith of assurance.'

   [1706] The Westminster Confession, Ch. XVIII., says that true believers
   'may in this life be certainly assured that they are in a state of
   grace, and may rejoice in hope of the glory of God, which hope shall
   never make them ashamed.' This assurance is 'founded upon the divine
   truth of the promises of salvation, the testimony of the Spirit
   witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.' It is not
   of 'the essence of faith,' and may be 'shaken, diminished, and
   intermitted,' yet revived again in due time and keep us from utter
   despair.

   [1707] In his sermons on Temptation, Vol. II. p. 215, and on
   Perfection, Vol. I. p. 356; Vol. II. p. 168: 'The highest perfection,'
   he says, 'which man can attain while the soul dwells in the body, does
   not exclude ignorance and error and a thousand infirmities.'

   [1708] Meth. Catech. No. 3, p. 37: 'It is the privilege of every
   believer to be wholly sanctified, and to love God with all his heart in
   the present life; but at every stage of Christian experience there is
   danger of falling from grace, which danger is to be guarded against by
   watchfulness, prayer, and a life of faith in the Son of God.'

   [1709] Wesley has two sermons on Christian Perfection, one on Phil.
   iii. 12 (Vol. I. p. 355), and one on Heb. vi. 1 (Vol. II. p. 167). He
   distinguishes, (1) angelic, (2) Adamic, (3) absolute perfection--all of
   which he denies to man in his present state--and (4) the relative
   perfection, which he claims for him under the gospel dispensation,
   namely, perfect love to God. From 1 John iii. 6 and v. 18, he reasons,
   'A Christian is so far perfect as not to commit sin' (Vol. I. p. 365).
   He affirms that several persons have enjoyed this blessing of freedom
   from sin without interruption for many years, and not a few unto their
   death, as they have declared with their last breath (Vol. II. p. 174).
   Pope says (p. 527): 'The Spirit is imparted in this fullness for the
   perfect consecration of the soul to the Triune God: this is called the
   love of God perfected in us. The commandment requires from us in return
   the perfect love of the soul to God and man; and this perfection,
   promised to faith working by love, is abundantly attested as the
   possible and attained experience of Christians.' Pope distinguishes the
   Methodist theory of perfection from the ascetic, the fanatical, the
   Pelagian, the mystical, the Romanist, the imputationist (modern
   Calvinistic), and the Arminian (p. 535); and he mentions five
   characteristic marks of the Methodist doctrine, the chief of which is
   entire consecration to God in perfect love (p. 540).
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 112. Calvinistic Methodism.

   WHITEFIELD.

   George Whitefield labored with Wesley until 1741, when they parted on
   the question of predestination and free will; the former taking the
   Calvinistic, the latter, with his brother and the majority of
   Methodists, the Arminian side, and henceforth they pursued different
   paths, like Paul and Barnabas. Personally they became cordial friends
   again, and their friendship continued until death. This should not be
   forgotten when we read the bitter predestinarian controversy which
   their friends and followers carried on and renewed from time to time.
   When Whitefield heard of the dangerous illness of Wesley, who had
   already written his own epitaph, he sent him an affectionate letter
   (Dec. 3, 1753), saying, 'I pity myself and the Church, but not you. A
   radiant throne awaits you, and ere long you will enter into your
   Master's joy.' [1710] When Whitefield died in Newburyport (Sept. 30,
   1770), Wesley preached his funeral sermon (Nov. 18) at Whitefield's
   Chapel in Tottenham Court Road and at the Tabernacle, near Moorfields,
   on the text Numb. xxiii. 10, 'Let me die the death of the righteous,
   and let my last end be like his!' Without alluding to their temporary
   separation, he speaks of him in the highest terms as an eminent
   instrument of God, who in the business of salvation put Christ; as high
   as possible, and man as low as possible, and who brought a larger
   number of sinners from darkness to the light than any other man. He
   praises his 'unparalleled zeal, his indefatigable activity, his
   tenderness of heart towards the afflicted, and charitableness to the
   poor, his deep gratitude, his most generous aud tender friendship, his
   modesty, frankness, patience, courage, and steadfastness to the end.'
   [1711]

   Whitefield was free from sectarian spirit and cared little for
   organization. His sole purpose was to convert sinners to Christ, and to
   revive Churches to new zeal and energy. [1712] His labors were crowned
   with signal success. The day of judgment alone will reveal the number
   of his converts, and the amount of good which he kindled by his flaming
   sermons among Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and
   other denominations, as well as among the crowds of ungodly people who
   were attracted by his eloquence. [1713]

   But although most of his converts fell in with existing denominations,
   a considerable number of them formed three separate organizations. One
   of them, called 'the Whitefield Methodists,' were lost among the
   Independents. The other two still remain.

   THE COUNTESS OF HUNTINGDON'S CONNECTION.

   Selina, Countess of Huntingdon (1707-1791), a lady of true nobility of
   heart and intellect as well as rank, devoted, after the death of her
   husband and four children, her time and fortune to the spread of vital
   religion among the nobility and the court as well as the common people.
   She purchased halls and theatres in London, Bristol, and Dublin, built
   over sixty chapels, supported ministers, founded a college at Trevecca,
   in Wales, and stirred up others to similar liberality. She dispensed
   with her luxurious equipage and sold even her jewels for the benefit of
   this work. She took Whitefield, with whose Calvinism she sympathized,
   under her special patronage, and made him her chaplain, and exercised a
   sort of leadership over his congregations. Hence they became known as
   the 'Countess of (or Lady) Huntingdon's Connection.

   Whitefield bequeathed to the Countess his benevolent institutions and
   lands in Georgia, and this resulted in a mission to America.

   The ministers of this connection are almost identical in doctrine and
   Church polity with the Independents, but in public worship they use to
   some extent the Anglican Liturgy. Their principal institution is
   Chesunt College, in Herts.

   of the Calvinistic Methodists in Wales. Drawn up by their own
   Associated Ministers. Third ed. Mold, 1840.

   John Hughes: History of Welsh Methodism, (in Welsh). Liverpool, 1856, 3
   vols.

   William Williams: Welsh Calvinistic Methodism. An Historical Sketch (in
   English). London, 1872.

   Whitefield's preaching through Wales, and the kindred labors of Howell
   Harris, of Trevecca, Griffith Jones, Daniel Rowlands, Howell Davies,
   and William Williams--most of them clergymen of the Established Church
   who joined the Methodists--produced a powerful and extensive revival,
   and resulted in a new connection in 1743, and more fully in 1785, when
   the Rev. Thomas Charles, of Bala, one of the most zealous and useful
   preachers of his day, joined it. [1714]

   For many years the Welsh Methodists existed without a settled form of
   government or doctrinal confession.

   In 1823 it was unanimously agreed at the Associations of Aberystwith
   and Bala to issue in the Welsh language such a document, together with
   a sketch of the origin and early history of the denomination. An
   English edition was published in 1827.

   The Confession of Faith consists of forty-four chapters, and accords
   substantially in spirit and arrangement with the Westminster
   Confession, though it is far inferior to it in ability and accuracy.

   The articles in which it differs from the Wesleyan scheme are Arts. V.,
   XII., and XXXIV., which are as follows:

   V.--Of the Decree of God.

   God, from eternity, according to the counsel of his own will, and for
   the manifestation and exaltation of his glorious attributes, decreed
   all things which he should perform in time and to eternity, in the
   creation and governing of his creatures, and in the salvation of
   sinners of the human race; yet in such a manner that he is neither the
   Author of sin, nor does he force the will of his creatures in the
   fulfillment of his decree; and this decree of God is not depended on
   any thing in a creature, nor yet on the foreknowledge of God; but
   rather God knows that such and such circumstances will take place,
   because he has ordained that it should be so. God's decree is
   infinitely wise, perfectly righteous, and existing from eternity; it is
   a free, an ample, a secret, gracious, holy, good, an unchangeable and
   effectual decree.

   XII.--Of the Election of Grace.

   God from eternity elected and ordained Christ to be a Covenant Head, a
   Mediator, and a Surety to his Church; to redeem and to save it. God
   also elected in Christ a countless multitude out of every tribe,
   tongue, people, and nation, to holiness and everlasting life; and every
   means were employed to effect this purpose most securely. This election
   is eternal, righteous, sovereign, unconditional, peculiar or personal,
   and unchangeable. It wrongs none, though God has justly left some
   without being elected, yet he has not wronged them: they are in the
   same condition as if there had been no election; and had there been no
   election, no flesh had been saved.

   XXXIV.--Of Perseverance in Grace.

   Those whom God has made acceptable in the Beloved, whom he has
   effectually called, and whom the Spirit sanctifies, can not completely
   and forever fall from a state of grace, but they shall assuredly be
   supported unto the end, and they shall be saved. Their perseverance
   depends not on their own will, but on the unchangeableness of the
   purpose of God, the election of grace, the power of the Father's love,
   the sufficiency of the propitiation of Christ, the success of his
   intercession, union with him, the indwelling of the Spirit within them,
   the seed of God implanted in their souls, the nature and strength of
   the covenant, and the promise and oath of God. Founded on these things,
   perseverance is certain and unfailing. Though they may, through the
   temptations of Satan and the world, the great power of their indwelling
   corruption, and the neglect of using the means for their support, fall
   into sins, and remain in them for some time, and thus displease God,
   grieve the Holy Spirit, injure their grace, lose their comfort, harden
   their hearts, sting their consciences, draw a temporal judgment upon
   themselves, harm others, and disgrace the cause of God, yet they shall
   be kept by the power of God through faith to salvation, though their
   falls will be felt most bitterly by them.

   Those who continue to live quietly in sin, and comfort themselves that
   they are in a gracious state, show evident signs that they are
   self-deceivers. For by perseverance in grace is not meant the
   continuing to enjoy and to inherit external Gospel privileges merely;
   but a continuance in holiness, diligence, watchfulness, a holy temper
   and walk, and a scrupulous observance of every duty. There is nothing
   more opposed to sin than a perseverance in grace; and whosoever shall
   thus continue in grace to the end shall be saved.

   [1712] In this unselfish zeal he has a worthy successor in our day in
   Mr. Moody.

   [1713] 'Whitefield's preaching was such as England never heard
   before--theatrical, extravagant, often commonplace, but hushing all
   criticism by its intense reality, its earnestness of belief, its deep,
   tremulous sympathy with the sin and sorrow of mankind. It was no common
   enthusiast who could wring gold from the close-fisted Franklin and
   admiration from the fastidious Horace Walpole, or who could look down
   from the top of a green knoll at Kingswood on twenty thousand colliers,
   grimy from the Bristol coal-pits, and see as he preached the tears
   "making white channels down their blackened cheeks."'--Green, History
   of the English People, p. 718 (Engl. ed.). Dr. Abel Stevens, an
   Arminian Methodist, calls Whitefield 'the most eloquent, the most
   flaming preacher that the Christian Church has known since its
   apostolic age, whose eloquence sanctified, wakened the whole British
   empire' (Centenary of Amer. Methodism, p. 24).

   [1714] Charles graduated at Oxford as A.B. in 1778, labored seven years
   as a clergyman of the Established Church, united himself with the
   Calvinistic Methodists in 1785, and drew up in 1790 a series of Rules
   for conducting Associations or Quarterly Meetings. He was one of the
   founders of the British and Foreign Bible Society.

   EDWARD IRVING.

   Edward Irving, the herald and pioneer of the 'Catholic Apostolic
   Church,' was born at Annan, in Scotland, 1792, and died in the vigor of
   manhood at Glasgow, Dec. 8, 1834, where he lies buried in the crypt of
   the cathedral. He belonged to the Presbyterian Church, and for several
   years (1819-1822) labored in Glasgow as the assistant of the great and
   good Dr. Chalmers.

   In 1822 he accepted a call to the Caledonian Chapel, Hatton Garden,
   London, and at once became the most powerful and popular preacher of
   the metropolis. He was at that time overflowing with bodily and
   spiritual life and energy. He excelled in the noblest gifts of
   eloquence, cultivated on the models of Hooker and Jeremy Taylor. Lofty
   thoughts clothed in gorgeous, semi-poetic language, devotional fervor,
   a solemn manner, a sonorous voice, a quaint antique style, a broad
   Scotch accent, an imposing figure, bushy hair flowing down in ringlets,
   a beaming face (which reminded Sir Walter Scott of that of the Saviour
   on Italian pictures), all combined to attract large and intelligent
   audiences, and to secure their closest attention, as if they listened
   to a messenger from the presence of the great Jehovah. De Quincey
   judged him to be, more than any man he ever saw, 'a son of thunder, and
   unquestionably by many degrees the greatest orator of our times.' He
   attracted people from all classes--noblemen, statesmen, and authors.
   When on a visit to Edinburgh and Glasgow, he roused the population at
   sunrise from their beds to hear his discourses. He shook the kingdom
   with his eloquence.

   While he ruled like a monarch from his pulpit, he was a docile pupil of
   Coleridge, and received from the suggestive conversations of the old
   sage seeds of truth which seriously modified his Scotch Calvinistic
   creed. He now made more account of the incarnation and the true
   humanity of Christ, maintaining that he assumed our fallen, i.e.,
   temptable, mortal, corruptible nature, yet without sin itself, into
   complete fellowship with his divine person. This exposed him to the
   charge of denying the sinlessness of our Saviour, which was far from
   his thoughts. He also gave a large place to the hope of the glorious
   return of Christ, and the revival of the miraculous gifts of the Spirit
   in the Church.

   In these views he was greatly strengthened by the sudden reappearance
   of what he believed to be the supernatural gifts of tongues,
   prophesying, and healing. These manifestations first occurred in the
   spring of 1830 in the west of Scotland, on the shores of the Clyde,
   among some pious Presbyterian men and women, who believed that their
   organs of speech were made use of by the Spirit of God for the
   utterance of his thoughts and intentions. Several persons from London,
   on hearing of these things, visited Scotland, and, on their return,
   held prayer-meetings in private houses, attended by devout members of
   different denominations. They united in supplications for the
   restoration of spiritual gifts. In April, 1831, the same manifestations
   took place among members of the Church of England and friends of Irving
   in London. The 'prophesyings' were addressed to the audience in
   intelligible English, and resembled the solemn exhortations of Quakers
   moved by the Spirit. The speaking in tongues consisted of soliloquies
   of the speaker, or dialogues between him and God which no one could
   understand. The burden of the prophetic utterances was the judgments
   impending on the apostate Church, the speedy coming of Christ, and the
   duty of preparing his way. [1715]

   Similar manifestations of ecstatic utterances in seasons of powerful
   religious excitement appeared among the Montanists in the second
   century, the persecuted Protestants in France, called the 'Prophets of
   Cevennes,' and among the early Quakers.

   These extraordinary proceedings naturally led to a rupture between
   Irving and the Presbytery of London (1832). He was turned out of the
   church built for him in Regent Square, and ultimately deposed from the
   ministry of the Church of Scotland by the Presbytery of Annan (1833),
   from which he had received his first license to preach.

   On being driven from Regent Square, he was followed by the larger part
   of his congregation to Newman Street; and the following year, when his
   Presbyterian orders had been taken from him, he humbly submitted to
   reordination by one whom he received as an apostle. He never rose
   beyond the position of an 'angel,' or pastor, in the new Church, and,
   after less than two years of great labors and sufferings, passed from
   this world of trial into the regions of light.

   He is little mentioned in the writings of his followers, and is
   regarded by them merely as a forerunner or John the Baptist, not as the
   founder of their community. His brilliant meteoric career, lofty
   character, and sad end created profound interest and sympathy. Dr.
   Chalmers, on hearing of his death, said that 'he was one in whom the
   graces of the humble Christian were joined to the virtues of the old
   Roman.' Thomas Carlyle, his countryman and early friend, thus
   characterizes Irving: 'He was appointed a Christian priest, and strove
   with the whole force that was in him to be it. I call him, upon the
   whole, the best man I have ever, after trial enough, found in this
   world, or now hope to find.' [1716]

   THE CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH.

   This remarkable man, whose purity and piety can be as little doubted as
   his genius and eloquence, whatever may be thought of his soundness and
   judgment, gave the strongest if not the first impulse to the religious
   movement which, since its organization, is usually called after his
   name, but which calls itself 'The Catholic Apostolic Church.' [1717] It
   took full shape and form after his death, as it claims, under
   supernatural direction. It is one of the unsolved enigmas of Church
   history: it combines a high order of piety and humility of individual
   members with astounding assumptions, which, if well founded, would
   require the submission of all Christendom to the authority of its
   inspired apostles.

   The modern 'Apostolic' Church believes and teaches that the Lord, who
   will soon appear in glory, has graciously restored, or at least begun
   to restore his one true Church, by reviving the primitive supernatural
   offices and gifts, which formed the bridal outfit of the apostolic age,
   but were soon afterwards lost or marred by the ingratitude and unbelief
   of Christendom. It claims to have apostles, prophets, and evangelists
   for the general care of the Church, and angels (or bishops), presbyters
   (or priests), and deacons for the care of particular congregations. All
   officers are called by the Holy Ghost through the voice of the
   prophets, except the deacons, who are chosen by the congregation as its
   representatives. They form a more complete hierarchy than that of the
   Episcopal or even the Greek and Roman Churches, whose bishops never
   claimed to be inspired apostles, but only successors of the apostles.

   If the twelve modern apostles were truly called by Christ and endowed
   with all the powers and functions of that unique office, men will
   naturally look for sufficient evidence of the fact. But nine of these
   apostles died before 1876, and their vacancies have not been filled,
   nor are they expected to be filled. The Church, then, is relapsing into
   the same destitute condition which, according to their own theory,
   preceded this movement. [1718] Their only hope is in the speedy return
   of our Lord.

   To this apostolic hierarchy corresponds a highly ritualistic worship,
   with a solemn liturgy, based upon the Anglican and ancient Greek
   liturgies, and with an elaborate symbolism, derived from a fanciful
   interpretation of the Jewish tabernacle as a type of the worship of the
   Christian Church in the wilderness.

   In this hierarchical constitution and ritualistic worship consists the
   chief peculiarity of this community. Its ministers and members have
   accordingly a very high idea of the Church and of the Sacraments. They
   are strict believers in baptismal regeneration and the real presence,
   though neither in the Roman nor the Lutheran sense. They reject
   transubstantiation and consubstantiation as well as the merely
   symbolical presence, and hold to the spiritual real presence of Calvin,
   but combine with it the view of Irenæus and other early fathers, that
   the elements, after being consecrated by the invocation of the Holy
   Ghost, have a heavenly and spiritual, as well as a material character,
   and are antitypes of the body and blood of Christ. They regard the
   eucharist as the centre of Christian worship, and not only as a
   sacrament, but also as a sacrifice in the patristic sense of a
   thank-offering, and they connect with it a commemoration of the
   departed. They are, upon the whole, the highest of High-Churchmen. They
   are in this respect the very antipodes of the Plymouth Brethren, the
   lowest of Low-Churchmen and the most independent of Independents,
   although both agree in their antagonism to the historical Churches and
   their expectation of the speedy coming of the Lord.

   Yet, on the other hand, the Irvingites are unquestionably Protestant,
   and accept the positive results of the Reformation. They reject the
   Pope, not indeed as the Antichrist or 'the man of sin,' who will be
   revealed in the last times as the outgrowth of unbelief and
   lawlessness, but as an antichristian usurper of supreme authority in
   the Church. In their general belief they are as orthodox as any other
   denomination. They receive the whole Scriptures with devout reverence
   as their supreme guide. They lay stress on the oecumenical creeds, and
   embody them in their liturgical services. In catechetical instruction
   they use the Anglican Catechism, with an additional part inculcating
   their peculiar views about the constitution and order of the Christian
   Church. They manifest a catholic spirit, and sustain, as individuals,
   fraternal relations with members of other denominations. Upon the
   whole, they have most sympathy with the Episcopal Church, from which
   they received the majority of their original members. Of their
   apostles, eight were Anglicans (including two clergymen and two members
   of Parliament), three Presbyterians, and one Independent. Their main
   strength is in London, where they have seven churches, after the model
   of the seven churches in Asia Minor. They have also congregations in
   many of the principal cities in England and Scotland, and in some parts
   of the Continent of Europe, especially North Germany; while in Roman
   Catholic countries and in America they have made little or no progress.

   The Irvingite movement has directed the attention of many serious minds
   to a deeper study of the supernatural order and outfit of the Apostolic
   Church, the divisions and reunion of Christendom, and the
   eschatological questions connected with the second advent.

   STATEMENT OF THE REV. W. W. ANDREWS.

   With these remarks we introduce a fuller inside account of the Catholic
   Apostolic Church, which was kindly prepared for this work by the Rev.
   W. W. Andrews, of Wethersfield, Conn. He has been thoroughly acquainted
   with the movement from the beginning, and is highly esteemed by all who
   know him as a Christian gentleman and scholar:

   'The body of Christians who call themselves by the name of the Catholic
   Apostolic Church, not as exclusively their own, but because it is the
   proper designation of the one Catholic Church, is distinguished from
   all other Christian communions by the claim to the possession of gifts
   and ministries which, after having been long lost or suspended in their
   exercise, they believe to be now again restored to prepare the way for
   the coming and kingdom of the Lord.

   History.

   'The history of this religious movement can be given in few words.
   About the beginning of the second quarter of the present century, there
   was much prayer in many countries, but especially in Great Britain, for
   the outpouring of the Holy Ghost; and early in the year 1830
   supernatural manifestations occurred in several parts of Scotland, in
   devout members of the Presbyterian Church, in the form of tongues,
   prophesyings, and healings. The following year similar manifestations
   took place in London, first in members of the Church of England, and
   afterwards among other religious bodies.

   'Towards the end of the year 1832, by which time the supernatural
   character and divine origin of these spiritual phenomena had been
   abundantly attested, and a considerable number of persons had become
   believers, another and most important step was taken in the restoration
   of the apostolic office. The will of God that certain men should serve
   him as apostles was made known through supernatural utterances of the
   Holy Ghost by prophets, as when, at Antioch, he said, "Separate me
   Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them." The
   apostolate to the Gentiles, begun in the calling of Paul, but then left
   unfinished, the Lord now, at the end of the dispensation, set his hand
   to restore; and by the middle of the year 1835 the full number was
   completed, and they entered as a twelvefold Apostolic College on the
   work of caring for the whole Christian Church. As Great Britain had
   been chosen of God to be the centre of this catholic movement, one of
   the first duties laid upon the restored apostles was the preparing of a
   Testimony to the Bishops of the Church of England and Ireland, and of
   another to the King's Privy Council, in which they pointed out the sins
   and perils of those lands, and testified to the coming of the Lord as
   the only hope of mankind, and to the work of the Holy Ghost as the
   necessary means of preparation.

   'A year or two later, they addressed a more full and complete
   testimony, of the same general character, to all the Rulers in Church
   and State throughout Christendom. They did this, because it was their
   duty, from the nature of their office, to seek the blessing of the
   whole flock of God. Apostles alone have universal jurisdiction, as they
   alone receive their commission directly from the Lord; and it belonged
   to them, when restored towards the close of the long history of the
   Church, to take up those questions in respect to doctrine,
   organization, and worship which had broken the unity of Christendom;
   and having examined the creeds and rites and usages of every part, to
   separate the evil from the good, and to stamp with their apostolic
   authority every fragment of divine truth and order which had been
   preserved. This they have been doing for more than forty years, and the
   results to which they have arrived may be thus briefly stated.

   Doctrines.

   'They hold the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments (the Old
   Testament as received from the Jews, without the Apocrypha) to contain
   the sum and substance of all divine revelations, and therefore to be
   the supreme and infallible standard of doctrine.

   'But they also believe that Christ's promise to be with his Church to
   the end of the world has not been made void, and that the Holy Spirit
   has borne a living witness to the one faith in all generations; and
   they have adopted the three great creeds commonly called the Apostles',
   the Nicene, and the Athanasian, as expressing more clearly than any
   others the belief of the Universal Church. The great doctrines of the
   holy Trinity, the incarnation, the atoning death and bodily
   resurrection of the Lord, his ascension and high priestly work in
   heaven, the descent of the Holy Ghost to draw men to Christ, and to
   regenerate, sanctify, and endow with heavenly gifts them that believe,
   together with the second personal coming of the Lord to judge the quick
   and the dead, and to administer eternal retributions, they hold in
   their plain and obvious import, in harmony with the whole Orthodox
   Church, Greek, Roman, and Protestant.

   'These creeds they have appointed to be used in divine worship: the
   Apostles', at the daily morning and evening services; the Nicene, in
   the ordinary celebrations of the eucharist on the Lord's Day; and the
   Athanasian, four times in the year, at the great festivals of
   Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, and All-Saints. They use the Nicene Creed
   in the form in which the Western Church receives it, retaining the
   Filioque, but not condemning the Eastern Church for using it in the
   form in which it was left by the Council of Constantinople.

   'In respect to the great central truth of the incarnation, the key to
   all the purposes and works of God, they teach that the second Person in
   the adorable Godhead, the only and eternally begotten Son, became man
   by assuming our entire humanity--body, soul, and spirit --under the
   conditions of the fall, but without sin, through the overshadowing of
   the Holy Ghost. They reject, therefore, the dogma of the immaculate
   conception of the mother of the Lord as against the truth of holy
   Scripture, which declares the whole human race to have been involved in
   the fall of the first Adam. They teach that by being born of a mother
   of the fallen race, he took the common nature of man, with all its
   infirmities, burdens, and liabilities, so that he could be tempted in
   all points like as we are, and be dealt with in all things by the
   Father as the representative of mankind. But they also make prominent
   the work of the Holy Ghost in effecting the incarnation, holding that
   it was through his presence and power that the Son of God was conceived
   of the Virgin Mary, and afterwards anointed for his public ministry; so
   that while it was a divine person who became incarnate, he had no
   advantage of his Godhead in his earthly life, but did every thing as
   man upheld, guided, and energized by the Holy Ghost.

   'They hold, with the Church of England, and all the great leaders of
   the Reformation, that the death of the Lord Jesus Christ was "a full,
   perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the
   sins of the whole world" (and not merely for those of the elect); and
   on this ground they stand aloof both from the rationalism which denies
   its vicarious and expiatory nature, and from the Roman doctrine of the
   mass, which teaches that the sacrifice of the cross needs to be
   supplemented by the sacrifices of the eucharist, in which the Lamb of
   God is continually immolated afresh.

   'But they go beyond the theology of the Reformation in respect to the
   Church, which they look upon as the fruit of the death and resurrection
   of Christ, and of the descent of the Holy Ghost which followed his
   ascension; and as differing, therefore, fundamentally in its spiritual
   essence and prerogatives from all the companies of the faithful in the
   preceding dispensations. They believe that in rising from the dead he
   became the fountain of a new life, the head of a redeemed humanity, of
   which those who believe in him are made partakers by the operations of
   the Holy Ghost working in and through the ordinances of his Church. The
   Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are the divinely appointed
   means of conveying and nourishing this new life of his resurrection, by
   the implanting and energizing of which the whole multitude of the
   faithful are made to be the One Body of Christ.

   'As to the structure and endowments of the Church, they hold that its
   original constitution contains the abiding law for all generations. The
   fourfold ministry of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors,
   first fulfilled by the Lord himself when upon earth, was continued in
   his Church after he had gone into heaven, because it was the necessary
   instrumentality of conveying his manifold grace and blessing, and of
   bringing his Body to the stature of his fullness (Eph. iv. 11-16). The
   Holy Ghost was given to be the permanent possession of his people; and
   the apostles reject the common distinction between ordinary and
   extraordinary gifts as wholly unscriptural, and as restraining the
   manifestations of the Spirit. They lay great stress upon the connection
   of the descent of the Comforter with the glorifying of the Lord Jesus
   (John vii. 39), and teach that the object of his mission was to reveal
   the glory and manifest the energies of the Man whom God had exalted
   from the weakness and dishonor of the grave to his own right hand.
   Supernatural gifts and miraculous workings are therefore in accordance
   with the nature of the dispensation, which began with the resurrection
   of the Lord, and is to end with the resurrection of his saints.

   Worship.

   'Its chief features are the celebration of the Eucharist on every
   Lord's day; services at six in the morning and five in the evening of
   every day in the year, requiring for their complete fulfillment the
   three ministries of angel, priests, and deacons; the observance of the
   great feasts of the Church, excluding those in honor of particular
   saints; and a monthly service by the seven churches in London gathered
   into one as a symbol of the Universal Church, which is also observed in
   all the congregations throughout the world.

   'The holy Eucharist is made to be the centre of worship, of which
   Christ, the great High-Priest in the heavens, is the leader, and the
   Mosaic ritual the shadow and type. The showing to the Father of that
   one sacrifice of the cross, which is the basis of all intercession, is
   effected by the Lord himself, by his own bodily presence in heaven; and
   the Church is enabled to do the same upon the earth by means of that
   sacrament in which he places in her hands the symbols and spiritual
   reality of his body and blood. The eucharist is regarded as the
   antitype of the priestly act of Melchizedek in bringing forth bread and
   wine to Abraham, the father of the faithful, from whom he received the
   tenth of all; and in the offertory, both the tithes and the offerings
   of the people are brought up and presented to God as an act of worship.

   'As the death of the cross was itself the fulfillment of all the bloody
   sacrifices of the Law, the commemoration of it in the holy Supper
   becomes the distinguishing Christian rite, from which all other acts of
   worship, especially the daily morning and evening services--the
   antitype of the daily services of the Tabernacle--derive their life and
   power. All the purest and most catholic parts of all the rituals of
   Christendom have been gathered up and woven together, to form, with
   such additions as the present exigencies of the Church demand, a
   comprehensive and organic system of worship, at once purely Scriptural,
   and embodying the richest liturgical treasures of the past. Among the
   errors and superstitions which have been weeded out are
   transubstantiation, the worship of the Virgin Mary and of saints and
   angels, the use of images and pictures, and prayers for deliverance
   from purgatorial fires. But in rejecting the corruption of the truth,
   the truth itself has not been cast away; and the doctrine of the real
   presence (as a spiritual mystery involving no physical change of the
   elements), the thankful and reverential mention of the Mother of the
   Lord ("And with the holy angels, and with thy Church in all
   generations, we call her blessed"), and continual supplications and
   intercessions in behalf of the faithful departed, that they "may rest
   in the peace of God, and awake to a joyful resurrection," all have
   place in the services appointed by the apostles.

   Organization and Unity of the Church.

   'The unity of the Church is held as a fundamental fact, resulting from
   the acts and operations of God, and not from the agreements and
   confederacies of men. There is one Body of Christ, embracing all who
   have been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
   the Holy Ghost (though, like the unfruitful branches of the vine, many
   may at last be cut out and cast away); and, in the absence of the Head,
   the harmonious intercommunion of the members is secured by the
   inworking of the One Spirit, and by a ministry proceeding immediately
   from the Head, and having jurisdiction over all the parts. The
   distinction between the Church Universal and the local or particular
   churches which compose it, is sharply drawn in the organization which
   has been developed under the rule of the apostles. The apostles
   themselves are the great Catholic ministry, through which guidance and
   blessing are conveyed to the whole body, and they are assisted in their
   work by prophets, evangelists, and pastors.

   'But each particular church, when fully organized, is under the rule of
   an angel, or chief pastor or bishop, with presbyters and deacons
   helping him in their subordinate places. It is his office to stand
   continually at his own altar at the head of his flock, carrying on the
   worship of God, cherishing and directing the gifts of the Holy Ghost,
   and exercising the pastoral charge over all the souls committed to his
   care. The threefold ministry of Episcopacy (and, in a lower form, of
   Presbyterianism) is here united with the central authority which Rome
   has wrongfully sought to attain by exalting her bishop to the place of
   universal headship.

   The Second Coming.

   'In respect to eschatology, they hold, with the Church of the first
   three centuries, that the second coming of the Lord precedes and
   introduces the millennium; at the beginning of which the first
   resurrection takes place, and at the close the general resurrection,
   with the final judgment and its eternal retributions to the righteous
   and the wicked. This period of a thousand years will be marked by the
   presence of the Lord and his risen and translated saints upon or in
   near proximity to the earth, then freed, at least partially, from the
   curse; by the re-establishment of the tribes of Israel in their own
   land, in fulfillment of the promises to their fathers, with Jerusalem
   rebuilt, to be the metropolitan centre of blessing to all nations; and
   by the bringing of all the families of mankind into the obedience and
   order and blessedness of the kingdom of God.

   'The restoration of the primitive gifts and ministries, like the
   ministries of Noah and of John the Baptist at the close of the
   antediluvian and Jewish dispensations, is to prepare for the ushering
   in of this next stage of God's actings. The order of events is to be as
   follows: The immediate and special work of the apostles is to gather
   and make ready a company of first-fruits, described (Rev. vii. 1-8) as
   sealed with the seal of the living God--the gift of the Holy Ghost
   bestowed by the hands of the apostles (Eph. i. 13; Acts xix. 1-5)--and
   as organized after a twelvefold law, of which the type was given in the
   structure of the twelve tribes of Israel. They are sealed while the
   angels are holding back the winds of judgment, before the great
   tribulation (Rev. vii. 14) is let loose upon the earth, that in them
   the Lord's words may be fulfilled, and they be counted worthy to escape
   all the things that are coming to pass, and to stand before the Son of
   Man (Luke xxi. 36).

   'But the taking away of the first-fruits is only the first stage of the
   mighty work to be done in the bringing of this dispensation to a close.
   It is to be followed by the revelation of the Man of Sin, the infidel
   Antichrist, who will be successfully resisted for a time by the two
   witnesses (Rev. xi. 3-12), but will at length prevail over them, and
   for a short time rule the nations with the tyrannizing power and lurid
   splendors of the pit. In the midst of the terrors of that great
   tribulation the harvest will be reaped, and all the faithful gathered
   into the garner of the great Husbandman; and thereupon will be the
   vintage of wrath (Rev. xiv. 15-20), and the Lord will come forth to
   tread the wine-press of his Father's indignation, and to cast the beast
   and the false prophet into the lake of fire.

   Prospects.

   'They regard the failure of their labors to gather the Churches of
   Christendom into their communion as being after the analogy of the
   failures at the close of all preceding dispensations, and as furnishing
   no argument against the reality of their divine mission.

   'The apostles do not, therefore, expect to have a large following at
   this stage of God's work. As a sheaf of first-fruits to the harvest,
   such will be the relation of the few who receive their testimony to the
   great multitude who will be saved out of the fiery trial of the time of
   the Antichrist. Nor does their faith fail because many of their
   brethren have been taken away by death, and it has pleased God to leave
   their places unfilled; for they look upon this as an indication that
   their present work is nearly finished, and that the Lord will soon take
   those who shall be found ready, to stand with him upon Mount Zion, safe
   in his hiding-place, while he pours out the vials of his wrath upon the
   earth. It would seem that the two apostolates at the beginning and the
   end of the dispensation form the company of the four-and-twenty elders
   who sit on thrones around the throne of the great King (Rev. iv. 4),
   partakers of his dominion, and associated with him in his work of
   judgment and rule.

   Relation to other Churches.

   'This brief statement of the position and doctrines of the "Catholic
   Apostolic Church" shows the grounds of their refusal to be called by
   any other name than belongs to the whole community of the baptized.
   They are a part of the one Church, differing from their brethren in
   being gathered under the proper ministries of the Church universal, and
   in being organized according to the original law of the Church as
   defined by St. Paul when speaking of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. xii.).
   They hold the one faith, the one hope, and the one baptism; and,
   without departing from the exact and literal teachings of the New
   Testament, they have added to these the larger statements of truth
   which have been the fruits of God's presence with his Church through
   all her generations.

   'Having its origin among the Protestant Churches, and retaining all the
   great truths pertaining to the cross of Christ, for which the
   Reformation was a noble and successful struggle, this Catholic work has
   laid under contribution the rich stores of the Greek and Roman
   communions, and is leading the Church on into still deeper knowledge of
   the purposes of God contained in holy Scripture, by means of the living
   ministers of Christ and the revelations of the Holy Ghost, to the end
   of preparing her as a bride for the marriage of the Lamb.'

   is not justified by facts; for Mrs. Oliphant's Life shows him to have
   willingly sacrificed popularity to his convictions.

   [1717] 'They do not lay claim to the name Catholic Apostolic as
   exclusively their own, but they use it as a proper designation of the
   one body of Christ, of which they are an organic part, and they refuse
   to be called by any other. They do this on the ground that it is wrong
   to affix to the Church the name of an eminent leader, like Luther or
   Calvin or Wesley; or one founded upon some feature of Church polity,
   such as Episcopal, Presbyterian, or Congregational; or one derived from
   some peculiar doctrine or rite, as Baptist or Free-will Baptist; or one
   expressing geographical limitations, such as Roman, Greek, Anglican, or
   Moravian. The essential characteristic of a thing should be expressed
   by its name, and the Church has for its three chief features, Unity, as
   the only organism of which Christ is head; Catholicity, as having a
   universal mission; and Apostolicity, as sent by Christ into the world,
   even as he was sent by the Father. It is a significant fact that this
   name, adopted in the Nicene Creed, has practically every where been
   changed, as into the Roman Catholic, the Greek Orthodox, the Protestant
   Episcopal, or something still narrower and more sectarian.'--W. W.
   Andrews, in Biblioth. Sacra, 1.c.

   [1718] From a conversation with a learned minister of that Church, to
   whom I mentioned this difficulty, I infer that he at least--I do not
   know how many more--regards its testimony as a partial failure, or
   merely as a temporary provision, to be superseded by a better one.
   Another writes to me in answer to the same question: 'We are quite
   ready to admit failure, great failure, so far as to the present effects
   of the movement upon Christendom. But intrinsically, and in relation to
   God's plans, we do not think it a failure.'

   § 114. The Articles of the Evangelical Alliance.

   Literature.

   Report of the Proceedings of the Conference, held at Freemasons' Hall,
   London, from August 19th to September 2d inclusive, 1846. Published by
   Order of the Conference. London (Partridge & Oakey, Paternoster Row),
   1847.

   Comp. also the Proceedings of the Seven General Conferences of the
   Alliance, held at London, 1851, Paris, 1855, Berlin, 1857, Geneva,
   1861, Amsterdam, 1867, New York, 1873, and Basle, 1879, all published
   in English, some also in the German, French, Dutch, and other
   languages.

   The General Conference of New York, the first held on American soil,
   was the most important, and its proceedings (published by Harper &
   Brothers, N. Y. 1874) form an interesting panoramic view of the
   intellectual and spiritual state of the Christian world at that time.

   CHARACTER AND AIM OF THE ALLIANCE.

   The 'Evangelical Alliance' is not an ecclesiastical organization, and
   has, therefore, no authority to issue and enforce an ecclesiastical
   creed or confession of faith. It is a voluntary society for the
   manifestation and promotion of Christian union, and for the protection
   of religious liberty. Its object is not to bring about an organic union
   of Churches, nor a confederation of independent Churches, but to
   exhibit, and to strengthen union and co-operation among individual
   members of different Protestant denominations without interfering with
   their respective creeds and internal affairs. It aims to realize the
   idea of such a Christian union as is consistent with denominational
   distinctions and varieties in doctrine, worship, and government. It may
   ultimately lead to a closer approximation of the Churches themselves,
   but it may and does exist without ecclesiastical union; and
   ecclesiastical union would be worthless without Christian union. It is
   remarkable that our Lord, in his sacerdotal prayer, which is the magna
   charta of Christian union, makes no reference to the Church or to any
   outward organization. The communion of saints has its source and centre
   in their union with Christ, and this reflects his union with the
   Father.

   The Alliance extends to all nationalities and languages, but is
   confined, so far, to Christians who hold what is understood to be the
   Scriptural or evangelical system of faith as professed by the Churches
   of the Reformation and their legitimate descendants. It thus embraces
   Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists,
   Methodists, Moravians, and other orthodox Protestants, but it excludes
   Roman and Greek Catholics on the one hand, and the antitrinitarian
   Protestants on the other. The Quakers, though unwisely excluded by Art.
   IX., are in full sympathy with one of the two chief objects of the
   Alliance--the advocacy of religious liberty.

   THE CONFERENCE OF 1846.

   The call to the London Conference of 1846 for the formation of an
   Evangelical Alliance against infidelity was sufficiently liberal to
   encourage all orthodox Protestants to attend without doing any violence
   to their confessional conscience. But the High-Church elements, from
   aversion to miscellaneous ecclesiastical company, kept aloof, and left
   the enterprise in the hands of the evangelical Low-Church and
   Broad-Church ranks of Protestantism. The meeting was overwhelmingly
   English, and controlled by Episcopalians, Scotch Presbyterians, and
   English Dissenters. Next to them, America was best represented, and
   exerted the most influence. The delegation from the Continent was
   numerically small, but highly respectable. The whole number of
   attendants was over eight hundred ministers and laymen, from about
   fifty distinct ecclesiastical organizations of Protestant Christendom,
   among them many scholars and ministers of the highest Christian
   standing in their respective Churches and countries. Those who took the
   most active part in the proceedings were Sir Culling Eardley Smith
   (President), E. Bickersteth, B. W. Noel, W. M. Bunting, J. Angell
   James, Dr. Steane, Wm. Arthur, T. Binney, O. Winslow, Andrew Reed, of
   England; Norman Macleod, W. Cunningham, W. Arnot, R. Buchanan, James
   Begg, James Henderson, Ralph Wardlaw, of Scotland; Drs. Samuel H. Cox,
   Lyman Beecher, W. Patton, Robert Baird, Thomas Skinner, E. W. Kirk, S.
   S. Schmucker, of the United States; Drs. Tholuck, W. Hoffmann, E.
   Kuntze, of Germany; Adolphe Monod, Georges Fisch, La Harpe, of France
   and Switzerland. The meeting was one of unusual enthusiasm and
   interest. One of its most eloquent speakers, Dr. Samuel H. Cox, of New
   York, characterized it as an assembly

   'Such as earth saw never,

   Such as Heaven stoops down to see.'

   The late Dr. Norman Macleod wrote during the meeting, in a private
   letter recently brought to light: [1719] 'I have just time to say that
   our Alliance goes on nobly. There are one thousand members met from all
   the world, and the prayers and praises would melt your heart. Wardlaw,
   Bickersteth, and Tholuck say that in their whole experience they never
   beheld any thing like it. . . . It is much more like heaven than any
   thing I ever experienced on earth.'

   THE DOCTRINAL BASIS.

   The part of the proceedings with which we are concerned here is the
   attempt made to set forth the doctrinal consensus of evangelical
   Christendom as a basis for the promotion of Christian union and
   religious liberty.

   The Rev. Edward Bickersteth, Rector of Walton, Herts, and one of the
   leaders of the evangelical party in the Established Church of England,
   moved the adoption of the doctrinal basis, and Dr. S. H. Cox, a
   Presbyterian of New York, supported it in a stirring speech, on the
   third day (Aug. 21). After considerable discussion and some unessential
   modifications, the basis was adopted on the fifth day (Aug. 24), nemine
   contradicente; the vast majority raising their hands in approval, the
   rest abstaining from voting. The chairman then gave out the hymn,

   'All hail the great Immanuel's name,

   Let angels prostrate fall.'

   It 'was sung by the Conference with a depth of devotional feeling
   which, even during the meetings of the Conference, had never been
   surpassed.' [1720]

   The doctrinal basis is expressly declared 'not to be a creed or
   confession in any formal or ecclesiastical sense, but simply an
   indication of the class of persons whom it is desirable to embrace
   within the Alliance.' It consists of nine articles: (1) the divine
   inspiration and supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures; (2) the right
   and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Holy
   Scriptures; (3) the unity and trinity of the Godhead; (4) the total
   depravity of man in consequence of the fall; (5) the incarnation of the
   Son of God, his atonement, and his mediatorial intercession and reign;
   (6) justification by faith alone; (7) the work of the Holy Spirit in
   conversion and sanctification; (8) the immortality of the soul, the
   resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by Jesus Christ,
   with the eternal blessedness of the righteous and the eternal
   punishment of the wicked; (9) the divine institution of the Christian
   ministry, and the perpetuity of Baptism and the Lord's Supper.

   The basis is merely a skeleton: it affirms 'what are usually understood
   to be evangelical views' on the nine articles enumerated. To give an
   explicit statement of these views would require a high order of
   theological wisdom and circumspection. For the practical purpose of the
   Alliance, the doctrinal basis has upon the whole proved sufficient,
   though some would have it more strict, others more liberal, since it
   excludes the orthodox Quakers. It has been variously modified and
   liberalized by branch Alliances in calling General Conferences. The
   American branch, at its organization in New York, Jan., 1867, adopted
   it with a qualifying preamble, subordinating it to the more general
   consensus of Christendom, and allowing considerable latitude in its
   construction. [1721]

   § 115. The Consensus and Dissensus of Creeds.

   Philip Schaff: The Antagonisms of Creeds, in the "Contemporary Review,"
   London, Oct 1876, (Vol. XI. pp. 836-850). The Consensus of the Reformed
   Confessions, In the "Proceedings of the First Gen. Pres. Council,"
   Edinburgh, 1877; separately issued, New York, 1877.


   The Creeds of orthodox Christendom have passed before us. A concluding
   summary of the points of agreement and disagreement will aid the reader
   in forming an intelligent judgment on the possibility, nature, and
   extent of an ultimate adjustment of the doctrinal antagonisms which are
   embodied and perpetuated in the symbols of the historic Churches. The
   argumentation from Scripture, tradition, and reason belongs to the
   science of Symbolics.

   A. The Catholic Consensus of Greek, Latin, and Evangelical Christendom.

   The Consensus is contained in the Scriptures, and in the oecumenical
   Creeds which all orthodox Churches adopt. It may be more fully and
   clearly specified as follows:

   I.--RULE OF FAITH AND PRACTICE.

   The Divine Inspiration and Authority of the Canonical Scriptures in
   matters of faith and morals. (Against Rationalism.)

   II.--THEOLOGY.

   1. The Unity of the Divine essence. (Against Atheism, Dualism,
   Polytheism.)

   2. The Trinity of the Divine Persons.

   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier.

   (Against Arianism, Socinianism, Unitarianism.)

   3. The Divine perfections.

   Omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience, wisdom, holiness, justice,
   love, and mercy.

   4. Creation of the world by the will of God out of nothing for his
   glory and the happiness of his creatures. (Against Materialism,
   Pantheism, Atheism.)

   5. Government of the world by Divine Providence.

   III.--ANTHROPOLOGY.

   1. Original innocence.

   Man made in the image of God, with reason and freedom, pure and holy;
   yet needing probation, and liable to fall.

   2. Fall: sin and death.

   Natural depravity and guilt; necessity and possibility of salvation.
   (Against Pelagianism and Manichæism.)

   3. Redemption by Christ.

   IV.--CHRISTOLOGY.

   1. The Incarnation of the eternal Logos or second Person in the Holy
   Trinity.

   2. The Divine-human constitution of the Person of Christ.

   3. The life of Christ.

   His superhuman conception; his sinless perfection; his crucifixion,
   death, and burial; resurrection and ascension; sitting at the right
   hand of God; return to judgment.

   4. Christ our Prophet, Priest, and King forever.

   5. The mediatorial work of Christ, or the atonement.

   'He died for our sins, and rose for our justification.'

   V.--PNEUMATOLOGY.

   1. The Divine Personality of the Holy Spirit.

   2. His eternal Procession (ekporeusis, processio) from the Father, and
   his historic Mission (pempsis, missio) by the Father and the Son.

   3. His Divine work of regeneration and sanctification.

   VI.--SOTERIOLOGY.

   1. Eternal predestination or election of believers to salvation.

   2. Call by the gospel.

   3. Regeneration and conversion. Necessity of repentance and faith.

   4. Justification and sanctification.

   Forgiveness of sins and necessity of a holy lire.

   5. Glorification of believers.

   VII.--ECCLESIOLOGY AND SACRAMENTOLOGY.

   1. Divine origin and constitution of the Catholic Church of Christ.

   2. The essential attributes of the Church universal.

   Unity, catholicity, holiness, and indestructibility of the Church.
   Church militant and Church triumphant.

   3. The ministry of the gospel.

   4. The preaching of the gospel.

   5. Sacraments: visible signs, seals, and means of grace.

   6. Baptism for the remission of sins.

   7. The Lord's Supper for the commemoration of the atoning death of
   Christ.

   VIII.--ESCHATOLOGY.

   1. Death in consequence of sin.

   2. Immortality of the soul.

   3. The final coming of Christ.

   4. General resurrection.

   5. Judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ.

   6. Heaven and Hell.

   The eternal blessedness of saints, and the eternal punishment of the
   wicked.

   7. God all in all (1 Cor. xv. 28).

   B. Consensus and Dissensus of the Greek and Roman Churches.

   (a) CONSENSUS.

   I. The articles of the oecumenical Creeds, excepting the Filioque of
   the Latin recension of the Nicene Creed and the et filio of the
   Athanasian Creed.

   II. Most of the post-oecumenical doctrines, which are not contained in
   the oecumenical Creeds, and from which Protestants dissent, viz.:

   1. The authority of ecclesiastical tradition, as a joint rule of faith
   with the Scriptures.

   2. The worship (timetike proskunesis) of the Virgin Mary, the Saints,
   their pictures (not statues), and relics.

   3. The infallibility of the Church--that is, the teaching hierarchy
   (ecclesia docens). The Roman Church lodges infallibility in the papal
   monarchy, the Greek Church in the (seven) oecumenical Councils, and the
   patriarchal oligarchy as a whole. [1722]

   4. Justification by faith and works, as joint conditions.

   5. The Seven Sacraments or Mysteries, with minor differences as to
   confirmation and unction.

   6. Baptismal regeneration (in an unqualified sense), and the necessity
   of water-baptism for salvation.

   7. Priestly absolution by divine authority.

   8. Transubstantiation (metousiosis), and the adoration of the
   consecrated elements.

   9. The sacrifice of the Mass for the living and the dead.

   This forms the centre of worship. Preaching is subordinate.

   10. Prayers for the departed.

   On the authority of the Apocryphal books of the Old Testament,
   transubstantiation, Purgatory, and a few other points, the Greek
   doctrine is not so clearly developed and formulated; but, upon the
   whole, much nearer the Roman view than the Protestant.

   As to the popular use of the Bible, there is this important difference,
   that the Greek Church has never prohibited it, like the Roman, and that
   the Russian Church has recently favored it, and thus opened the way for
   a wholesome progress and possible reformation

   (b) DISSENSUS.

   I. The eternal Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son (Filioque):
   denied by the Greek, taught by the Latin Church.

   II. The papal supremacy and infallibility: rejected by the Greek Church
   as an antichristian usurpation, asserted by the Latin Church as its
   corner-stone.

   III. The immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary: proclaimed as a
   dogma by the Pope, 1854: [1723]

   IV. The marriage of the lower clergy: allowed by the Greek, forbidden
   by the Latin Church.

   V. Withdrawal of the eucharistic cup from the laity.

   VI. A number of rites and ceremonies.

   Greek rites: threefold baptismal immersion, instead of pouring or
   sprinkling; use of leavened, instead of unleavened, bread in the
   eucharist; the invocation of the Holy Ghost for the benediction of the
   sacred elements; infant communion; anointing baptized infants; the
   repetition of holy unction (to euchelaion) in sickness.

   C. Consensus and Dissensus of the Greek Church and the Evangelical
   Churches.

   (a) CONSENSUS.

   I. They believe the Scriptures and the doctrines of the oecumenical
   Creeds. (See A.)

   II. They reject:

   1. The supremacy and infallibility of the Pope.

   2. The immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary.

   3. The withdrawal of the cup from the laity.

   4. The enforced celibacy of priests and deacons.

   (The Greek Church, however, prohibits the second marriage of the lower
   clergy, and requires the celibacy of the bishops.)

   (b) DISSENSUS.

   I. The double Procession of the Holy Spirit. [1724]

   II. In the post-oecumenical doctrines mentioned sub B. (a), II., the
   Greek Church sides with Rome against Protestantism.

   D. Consensus and Dissensus of the Roman Catholic and the Evangelical
   Protestant Churches.

   (a) CONSENSUS. (See sub A.)

   (b) DISSENSUS.

   I. Scripture and Tradition, as a rule of faith.

   Roman Catholic doctrine:

   The necessity of ecclesiastical tradition (culminating in the
   infallible decisions of the papal see), as a joint rule of faith and as
   the sole interpreter of Scripture.

   Protestant doctrine:

   The absolute supremacy and sufficiency of the Scriptures as a guide to
   salvation.

   II. Other differences concerning the Scriptures.

   1. Extent of the Canon:

   The Apocrypha of the Old Testament are included in the Roman, excluded
   from the Protestant Canon.

   2. Authority of the Latin Vulgate:

   Put on a par with the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures by Rome; while
   Protestantism claims divine authority only for the original Scriptures
   of the inspired authors.

   3. Popular use and circulation of the Bible:

   Discouraged (and relatively forbidden) by Rome; encouraged by
   Protestantism, which goes hand in hand with the Word of God, and must
   stand or fall with it.

   III. Objects of Worship.

   Roman Catholic doctrine:

   1. God (latria);

   2. The Virgin Mary (hyperdulia);

   3. Angels and Saints (dulia);

   4. Images and Relics of Saints. Protestant doctrine:

   God alone. All other worship is gross or refined idolatry.

   The Roman Catholic Christian approaches Christ through human mediators,
   and virtually substitutes the worship of Mary for the worship of
   Christ; the Protestant approaches Christ directly, and prays to him as
   his only and all-sufficient High-Priest and Intercessor with the
   Father.

   IV. Primitive State.

   Difference (asserted by Roman Catholics, denied by Protestants) between
   the image of God (imago, eikon, tslm), i.e., the natural perfection of
   the first man as a rational and free being, and similitude of God
   (similitudo, homoiosis, dmdt), i.e., supernatural endowment of man with
   righteousness and holiness together with the immortality of the body.

   V. Original Sin.

   Roman Catholic doctrine:

   Original sin is a negative defect (carentia justitiæ originalis), or
   the loss of the similitude--not of the image--of God, and is entirely
   removed by baptism.

   Protestant doctrine:

   Original sin is a positive corruption and total depravity, involving
   the loss of (spiritual) freedom, and retains the character of sin after
   baptism.

   VI. Justification by faith and good works (Roman Catholic);--or by
   faith alone (Protestant).

   1. Different conceptions of justification (dikaiosis, justificatio): a
   gradual process of making the sinner righteous (identical with
   sanctification);--or a judicial and declaratory act of God (acquittal
   of the penitent sinner on the ground of Christ's merits and on
   condition of faith in Christ), followed by sanctification.

   2. Different conceptions of faith: intellectual assent and submission
   to divine authority;--or personal trust in Christ and living union with
   him.

   3. Different position assigned to works: condition of
   justification;--or evidence of justification.

   4. Assurance of justification and salvation: denied (except on the
   ground of a special revelation) by Roman Catholics; asserted by
   Protestants (though in different degrees).

   Paul and James. Basis of reconciliation: faith operative in love.
   [1725]

   VII. Good works of believers.

   The meritoriousness of good works (meritum ex congruo and meritum ex
   condigno): Works of supererogation, not commanded, but recommended
   (consilia evangelica), with corresponding extra merits, which
   constitute a treasury at the disposal of the Pope for the dispensation
   of indulgences.

   Here is the root of the ascetic and monastic system (vota monastica:
   voluntary obedience, poverty, and celibacy), and the chief difference
   between Roman Catholic and Evangelical ethics.

   VIII. The Church.

   1. Identification of the Church of Christ with the Church of Rome--the
   fundamental error (the proton pseudos) of the papacy.

   2. Distinction of the invisible Church (one and universal under the
   sole headship of Christ), and the visible Church (existing in many
   organizations or denominations): asserted by Protestants; denied by
   Roman Catholics.

   3. Different conception and application of the attributes of the
   Church; unity, holiness, catholicity, apostolicity, indefectibility,
   infallibility, and exclusiveness, especially the last (extra ecclesiam
   nulla salus, which is made to mean extra ecclesiam Romanam).

   IX. The Pope.

   The infallible head of the Universal Church, the Vicar of Christ on
   earth, by virtue of his office as the successor of Peter.

   This is the cardinal doctrine of Romanism, but rejected by Greeks and
   Protestants as an antichristian usurpation of the prerogative of
   Christ.

   X. Sacraments in general.

   1. Definition: visible signs of invisible grace instituted by the
   express command of Christ in the New Testament (Protestant);--or simply
   by the authority of the Church (Roman Catholic).

   2. Number: seven (Roman Catholic);--or two (Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper).

   3. Effect: ex opere operato (i.e., by virtue of the objective act);--or
   through faith (as the subjective condition).

   XI. Baptism.

   Its effect on original sin; its relation to regeneration; its necessity
   for salvation; and several ritual differences.

   XII. The Eucharist. Romanism holds, Protestantism denies:

   1. Transubstantiation and the adoration of the elements.

   2. The withdrawal of the cup from the laity.

   3. The Eucharist as a sacrifice, i.e., an actual though unbloody
   repetition of Christ's sacrifice on the cross by the priest for the
   sins of the living and the dead (the souls in purgatory).

   The celebration of the Mass is the centre of Roman Catholic worship.

   XIII. The other five Sacraments: Confirmation, Penance, Matrimony,
   Ordination, Extreme Unction.

   Maintained by Rome as sacraments proper; rejected by Protestants, or
   admitted only as semi- or quasi-sacramental acts.

   1. Confirmation.

   Retained by the Lutheran, Anglican, and the German Reformed Churches
   (as supplementary to infant baptism after a course of catechetical
   instruction). Rejected by other Protestant Churches, in which a
   voluntary union with the Church by a public profession of faith takes
   the place of confirmation.

   2. Penance (sacramentum pænitentiæ).

   Auricular confession and priestly absolution; satisfaction for venial
   sins; indulgences. The Lutheran (and Anglican) standards approve
   private confession to the minister; other Churches leave it entirely
   optional; all Protestants deny the efficacy of priestly absolution
   except as an official declaration of God's forgiving mercy to the
   penitent

   3. Ordination.

   A separate priesthood and clerical celibacy (Roman Catholic); the
   general priesthood of the laity and the right of the laity to
   participate in Church government (Protestant).

   4. Matrimony.

   Differences in matrimonial legislation, mixed marriages, and divorce.

   5. Extreme unction.

   Rejected by Protestants, who in James v. 14 emphasize the praying
   rather than 'the anointing with oil' (a physical remedy).

   XIV. Purgatory.

   A temporary middle place and state (until the final judgment) between
   heaven and hell for the purification of imperfect Christians, which may
   be advanced by prayers and masses in their behalf.

   Protestantism holds that there are only two conditions in the other
   world, but with various degrees of bliss or misery.

   The indulgences closely connected with purgatory were the first
   occasion, though not the cause, of the Reformation.

   E. Doctrinal Differences among Evangelical Protestants.

   I.--LUTHERANISM AND CALVINISM.

   1. Baptismal Regeneration.

   Baptism a means of regeneration (as concurrent with the sacramental
   act), and hence necessary for salvation;--or only a sign and seal of
   regeneration (whether concurrent or preceding or succeeding, according
   to God's free pleasure).

   2. The Encharistic presence.

   Corporeal real presence (in, with, and under the elements) for all
   communicants;--or spiritual real (dynamic and effective) presence for
   believers only.

   3. Christological.

   The extent of the communicatio idiomatum. [1726] The ubiquity of
   Christ's body: asserted by the Lutheran Church (as a dogmatic support
   to its doctrine of the eucharistic multipresence); denied by the
   Reformed (as inconsistent with the limitations of humanity and the fact
   of Christ's ascension to heaven).

   4. Predestination and the perseverance of saints.

   No difference between Luther and Calvin, who were both Augustinians,
   but between their followers. (Synergism of Melanchthon in his later
   period. Semi-Augustinianism of the Formula of Concord. Extreme
   Calvinism of the Synod of Dort.)

   II.--CALVINISM AND ARMINIANISM.

   1. Election: unconditional;--or conditional.

   2. Extent of redemption: limited to the elect;--or unlimited to all
   men.

   3 and 4. Nature of faith and grace: irresistible;--or resistible.

   5. Perseverance of saints;--or the possibility of total and final
   apostasy.

   III.--CONGREGATIONALISM.

   1. Conception of a Christian congregation or local church: a
   self-governing body of converted believers voluntarily associated for
   spiritual ends.

   2. Independence of such a church of foreign jurisdiction.

   3. Duty of voluntary fellowship with other churches.

   IV.--BAPTIST DOCTRINES.

   1. Congregationalism as sub III.

   2. Baptism.

   (a) Its subjects: only responsible converts on the ground of a
   voluntary profession of their faith.

   (b) Its mode: total immersion of the body.

   3. Universal liberty of conscience as a sphere over which civil
   government has no control. ('Soul-liberty.') [1727]

   V.--QUAKER DOCTRINES.

   1. Universal diffusion of the inner light for the salvation of men.

   2. Immediate revelation superior to, though concordant with, the
   outward testimony of the Scriptures.

   3. The ministry of the gospel depending on inspiration, and not
   confined to a class or sex.

   4. The sacraments are spiritual acts, not visible rites and ceremonies,
   as under the old dispensation.

   5. Worship is purely inward, and depends upon the immediate moving of

     __________________________________________________________________

   [1722] We say as a whole; for the Greek Church does not claim
   infallibility for any individual patriarch, and has herself condemned,
   in oecumenical Synods, as heretics not only Pope Honorius, of Rome, but
   also several of her own patriarchs, e.g., Nestorius, of Constantinople;
   Dioscurus, of Alexandria; Peter the Fuller, of Antioch; Sallustius, of
   Jerusalem; Cyril Lucar, of Constantinople.

   [1723] The Greek Archbishop Lykurgos, of Syra and Tenos (d. 1876),
   declared, while in England, in a conference with the Bishop of Ely,
   Feb. 4, 1870: 'The Orthodox Church considers the immaculate conception
   to be blasphemous. It destroys the doctrine of the Incarnation.' But in
   practice the worship of the blessed Virgin is carried as far in the
   Greek Church as in the Latin.

   [1724] In this doctrine the Protestant Confessions side with the Latin
   Church, or at least they do not oppose it. The eternal procession of
   the Spirit was no topic of controversy in the period of the
   Reformation, and may be regarded as an open question subject to further
   exegetical and theological investigation. A number of Episcopalians in
   England and America would be willing to expunge the Filioque from the
   Nicene Creed, or to compromise with the Orientals on the single
   procession of the Spirit from the Father through the Son. See the
   Theses of the Bonn Conference of 1875, at the close of Vol. II.

   [1725] Gal. v. 6, (pistis di agapes energoumene, is to be explained as
   the dynamic middle, not as the passive, 'completed in love' (the fides
   formata of Roman Catholic commentators).

   [1726] That is, whether it includes also the genus majestaticum, or the
   communication of the attributes of the divine nature to the human
   nature of Christ--affirmed by the Lutheran symbols, denied by the
   Reformed. See pp.319 sqq.

   [1727] President Anderson, of Rochester University (article Baptists in
   Johnson's Cyclopædia, Vol. I. p. 383), enumerates four distinctive
   doctrinal principles of the Baptists: (1) immersion; (2) believers only
   to constitute a visible church; (3) responsible converts only entitled
   to baptism; (4) separation of Church and State, and independence of
   each individual church as a body of baptized believers of any other
   body, whether ecclesiastical or political. But the second article is
   held also by the Congregationalists, and the fourth can not be called
   an article of faith.

   A large and influential Christian body whose historic position has been
   antagonism to all Church creeds containing articles formulated by
   non-biblical writers is the group known as The Disciples of Christ. In
   the number of its members, the fifth Protestant ecclesiastical body in
   the United States, it arose early in the nineteenth century in Western
   Pennsylvania under the leadership of Thomas Campbell, a Seceder
   minister from North Ireland and his son, Alexander Campbell. Born in
   Ireland, Sept. 12, 1788, Alexander came to America, 1809, settled in
   the Western part of Pennsylvania and died March 4, 1866, in Bethany,
   West Virginia, where he had established a college. Seeking relief from
   the restraints of ecclesiastical formularies and a return to the
   so-called implicity and ordinances of "original Christianity," Thomas,
   then a Presbyterian minister, formed "the Christian Association of
   Washington," Pennsylvania, and issued, 1809, a "Declaration and
   Address" to which the Disciples go back as the justification and basis
   of their existence as a distinct group. In 1811, he and his followers
   joined themselves in an independent organization at Brush Run, Pa. Two
   years later, the organization united with the Redstone Baptist
   Association. A division arising in this body over the principles of the
   "Church Reformation," as the movement led by the Campbells was called,
   the followers of the Campbells constituted themselves an independent
   body, 1827. Four years later, this body was enlarged by the accession
   of a number of churches which followed Rev. Barton W. Stone, once a
   member of the Presbytery of Lexington, Kentucky. The members of the
   Kentucky churches preferred to call themselves by the simple name
   "Christians" and for this reason the "Disciples" have often gone by
   that name.

   Alexander Campbell, the real founder of the new movement, was ordained
   1812 and immersed a few months later. He was a man of intellectual
   vigor and independence of thought, of positiveness of conviction and
   statement, and became abundant in labors. His views were set forth not
   only in the pulpit but through the columns of two periodicals, the
   Christian Baptist and the Millennial Harbinger, and in public
   discussions on the platform. These discussions, which aroused wide
   attention in Southern Ohio and the South West, were carried on with
   Robert Owen, 1829, and Archbishop Purcell of the Roman Catholic Church,
   1837, both in Cincinnati, and with the noted Presbyterian polemic
   theologian, Dr. Nathan L. Rice, in Lexington, Ky., 1843. The last
   discussion, which lasted sixteen days, had Henry Clay as its chairman.
   Campbell was accused of being "contentious" and "disputatious" while
   his skill as a debater was generally recognized.

   The distinctive tenets of the Disciples, as set forth in the
   Declaration and Address, are the "alone-sufficiency and all-sufficiency
   of the Bible"--to use the language of Alexander Campbell--and the
   unadulterated evil of Christian creeds and the denominational divisions
   in Christendom. With other Christians, they hold to the doctrines of
   the trinity, original sin, Christ's atonement and resurrection, the
   necessity of repentance and regeneration, and the two future states.
   They reject--to follow the Declaration and Address--human opinions and
   the inventions of men as having any authority in the Church of God and
   profess "to stand upon the ground on which the Church stood at the
   beginning . . . and to take up things just as the Apostles left them."
   The Society, so it was affirmed, "was formed for the sole purpose of
   promoting simple evangelical Christianity and to promote only such
   measures as, reduce to practice the original form of Christianity
   expressly exhibited in the sacred page. . . . Everything not taught and
   enjoined in the Bible is of no authority and nothing is to be made a
   term of communion among Christians which is not as old as the New
   Testament." Creeds of human composition are a calamity and have been
   the cause of the historic divisions in the Church and "divisions among
   Christians is a horrid evil. Although the Church of Christ must
   necessarily exist in particular and distinctive societies, locally
   separate one from another, yet ought there to be no schisms, no
   uncharitable divisions, among them." Further, by the Declaration and
   Address, the society rejected the application to itself of the name
   "Church" and its members desired to be regarded "merely as voluntary
   advocates of Church reformation; and, tired of the jarrings and
   janglings of a party spirit, to restore unity, peace and purity to the
   whole Church of God,"--a large, if not ambitious, and certainly most
   laudable purpose. In accordance with these affirmations, whereby the
   Scriptures are not only treated as the sole standard of Christian
   teaching but its language the sole organ through which it is to be
   conveyed and all human formularies intended to state and summarize
   those teachings are set aside as evil in their consequences, the
   Disciples have been inclined to look upon themselves as pioneers in the
   movement of Christian unity and Church union. For twenty years the body
   has had within itself an Association for the Promotion of Christian
   Unity. In spite of their formal declarations and wishes, the Disciples
   are a distinct ecclesiastical body, following the congregational scheme
   of church government and observing usages distinguishing them from many
   Christian bodies such as the weekly observance of the Lord's Supper and
   baptism by immersion, though denying baptismal regeneration. Whether
   such usages, the doctrines explicitly held in common with all
   Christians and their opposition to creeds, constitute a confessional
   formulary or not, seems to admit of two answers. The large volume of
   Kellems, 1930, ascribes to Alexander Campbell a doctrinal system no
   less positive than are the systems of other ecclesiastical bodies. By
   their evangelical activity and warm manifestation of union among
   themselves, the Disciples of Christ have not only reached large bodies
   of people but won the fellowship of other Christian communions and have
   shown that a Church's efficiency and solidarity does not necessarily
   depend upon an explicit formulary of human composition. The most
   prominent personage among the Disciples since Alexander Campbell has
   been James A. Garfield, President of the United States.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 117. The Universalists.

   The Universalist Churches of the United States, starting in New
   England, have modified the orthodox Christian system as expressed in
   the historic creeds but while differing among themselves, they retain
   reverence for Christ as a divine teacher, the belief in the immortality
   of the soul and suitable awards after death for conduct in this world.
   A movement towards the union of Congregational and Universalist
   churches has had advocates as in California, 1930. The New England
   Convention of Universalist Churches, meeting in Winchester, New
   Hampshire, 1803, adopted a Profession of Belief in three articles.
   Eddy, in his Hist. of Universalism, says that "while the Profession was
   sufficiently definite to exclude the possibility of mistaking its most
   prominent thought, the reconciliation of all souls to God, it was
   sufficiently liberal to be acceptable alike to Trinitarians and to
   Unitarians, to the believer in future punishment and to the believer
   that the consequences of sin are confined to this life." In 1899 the
   General Convention, meeting in Boston, added to the Winchester
   Profession, clauses giving "The Conditions of Fellowship." At a meeting
   of the Convention in Winchester, 1903, celebrating the adoption of the
   Profession, its three articles were spoken of "as the first explicit
   statement in a creed of what is known as liberal Christianity."

   "The Profession of Belief and Conditions of Fellowship are as follows"
   [1728]

   Art. I. We believe that the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
   Testaments contain a revelation of the character of God and of the
   duty, interest and final destination of mankind. Art. II. We believe
   that there is one God, whose nature is Love revealed in one Lord Jesus
   Christ, by one Holy Spirit of Grace, who will finally restore the whole
   family of mankind to holiness and happiness. Art. III. We believe that
   holiness and true happiness are inseparably connected, and that
   believers ought to be careful to maintain order and practice good
   works; for these things are good and profitable unto men.

   The Conditions of Fellowship shall be as follows: 1. The acceptance of
   the essential principles of the Universalist Faith to wit: 1 The
   Universal Fatherhood of God; 2 The Spiritual authority and leadership
   of His Son, Jesus Christ; 3 The trustworthiness of the Bible as
   containing a revelation from God; 4 The certainty of just retribution
   for sin; 5 The final harmony of all souls with God.

   The Winchester Profession is commended as containing these principles
   but neither this nor any other precise form of words is required as a
   condition of fellowship, provided always that the principles above
   stated be professed.

   2. The acknowledgment of the authority of the General Convention and
   assent to its laws.

   § 118. The Unitarians.

   The Unitarian Churches are a free association of societies which lay
   stress upon practical aims and require no subscription to a doctrinal
   formula. The nearest approach to such a formula is the declaration
   written by James Freeman Clarke and published by the Unitarian Sunday
   School Union, affirming "belief in the fatherhood of God, the
   brotherhood of man, the leadership of Jesus, salvation by character,
   the progress of mankind upward and onward forever." Founded in 1825,
   the American Unitarian Association announced its object to be "to
   diffuse the knowledge and promote the interest of pure Christianity."
   The older Unitarians, represented by Channing, while they rejected
   binding creedal formulas, the doctrines of the Trinity and total
   depravity and what was called the bleak Calvinism of New England, held
   to the exaltation of Christ and the immortality of the soul. Twenty of
   the original congregations of Massachusetts, including the Plymouth
   church, allied themselves with the movement. Humanistic efforts have
   been emphasized. In Boston, which became the home of literary culture,
   many of its representatives broke loose entirely from the historic New
   England ecclesiastical system and abandoned Christianity as a
   supernatural revelation for the philosophy known as transcendentalism.
   By the middle of the 19th century, Unitarianism had become synonymous
   with religious liberalism, basing its conclusions in part upon the
   results of German rationalistic criticism. Outside of Massachusetts,
   its following has been small and its churches include groups which join
   with the name Unitarian extreme tenets of religious liberalism.
   President Eliot of Harvard pronounced "independent thought the chief
   feature of Unitarianism."

   In 1865, largely under the influence of Dr. Bellows of New York City,
   "the National Conference of Unitarian and Other Christian Churches" was
   organized and passed the following resolution:

   "To secure the largest unity of the spirit and the widest practical
   co-operation of our body, it is hereby understood that all the
   resolutions and declarations of this convention are expressions only of
   its majority, committing in no degree those who object to them,
   claiming no other than a moral authority over the members of the
   convention, or the churches represented here, and are all dependent
   wholly for their effect upon the consent they command on their own
   merits from the churches here represented or belonging within the
   circles of our special fellowship."

   The words used in the preamble "The obligations of all disciples of the
   Lord Jesus Christ" led to a warm discussion and the formation of "The
   Free Religious Association." At a meeting of the National Conference,
   1894, the following preamble concerning faith and fellowship was
   adopted and has been interpreted in some sections to include in the
   fellowship of the Unitarian churches, members of the Brahmo Somaj of
   India and all others who "sympathize with the spirit and practical
   aims" of the Unitarians: [1729]

   "The Conference of Unitarian and other Christian Churches was formed in
   the year 1865, with the purpose of strengthening the churches and
   societies which should unite in it for more and better work for the
   kingdom of God. These churches accept the religion of Jesus, holding,
   in accordance with his teaching, that practical religion is summed up
   in love to God and love to man. The Conference recognizes the fact that
   its constituency is Congregational in tradition and polity. Therefore,
   it declares that nothing in this constitution is to be construed as an
   authoritative test; and we cordially invite to our working fellowship
   any who, while differing from us in belief, are in general sympathy
   with our spirit and our practical aims."

     * Summa ista Romani Pontificis auctoritas, Venerabiles Fratres, non
       opprimit sed adjuvat, non destruit sed ædificat, et sæpissime
       confirmat in dignitate, unit in charitate, et Fratrum, scilicet
       Episcoporum, jura firmat atque tuetur. Ideoque illi, qui nunc
       judicant in commotione, sciant, non esse in commotione Dominum.
       Meminerint, quod paucis abhinc annis, oppositam tenentes
       sententiam, abundaverunt in sensu Nostro, et in sensu majoris
       partis hujus amplissimi Consessus, sed tunc judicaverunt in spiritu
       auræ lenis. Numquid in eodem judicio judicando duæ oppositæ possunt
       existere conscientiæ? Absît. Illuminet ergo Deus sensus et corda;
       et quoniam Ipse facit mirabilia magna solus, illuminet sensus et
       corda, ut omnes accedere possint ad sinum Patris, Christi Jesu in
       terris indigni Vicarii, qui eos amat, eos diligit, et exoptat unum
       esse cum illis; et ita simul in vinculo charitatis conjuncti
       proeliare possimus proelia Domini, ut non solum non irrideant nos
       inimici nostri, sed timeant potius, et aliquando arma malitiæ
       cedant in conspectu veritatis, sicque omnes cum D. Augustino dicere

     * Docemus et declaramus, Ecclesiam Romanam, disponente Domino, super
       omnes alias ordinariæ potestatis obtinere principatum, et hanc
       Romani Pontificis jurisdictionis potestatem, quæ vere episcopalis
       est, immediatam esse, erga quam cujuscunque ritus et dignitatis
       pastores atque fideles, tam seorsum singuli quam simul omnes,
       officio hierarchicæ subordinationis veræque obedientiæ
       obstringuntur, non solum in rebus, quæ ad fidem et mores, sed etiam
       in iis, quæ ad disciplinam et regimen Ecclesiæ per totum orbem
       diffusæ pertinent; ita ut, custodita cum Romano Pontifice tam
       communionis quam ejusdem fidei professionis unitate, Ecclesiæ
       Christi sit unus grex sub uno summo pastore. Hæc est catholicæ
       veritatis doctrina, a qua deviare salva fide atque salute nemo
       potest. . . . Si quis itaque dixerit, Romanum Pontificem habere
       tantummodo officium inspectionis vel directionis, non autem plenam
       et supremam potestatem jurisdictionis in universam Ecclesiam, non
       solum in rebus, quæ ad fidem et mores, sed etiam in iis, quæ ad
       disciplinam et regimem Ecclesiæ per totum orbem diffusæ pertinent;
       aut eum habere tantum potiores partes, non vero totam plenitudinem
       hujus supremæ potestatis; aut hanc ejus potestatem non esse
       ordinariam et immediatam sive in omnes ac singulas ecclesias, sive
       in omnes et singulos pastores et fideles; anathema sit.: [4176]1
     * Docemus, quod Sacramenta: [4177]1
     * Docent etiam, quod his Christi verbis, quibus ipse panem corpus
       suum, et vinum speciatim sanguinem suum esse pronunciat, nemo de
       suo quidquam affingat, admisceat aut detrahat, sed simpliciter his
       Christi verbis, neque ad dexteram neque ad sinistram declinando
       credat.: [4178]1
     * Documenta ad illustrandum Concilium Vaticanum anni: [4179]1
     * Dominus, repellens intempestivam festinationem, dixit: 'Quid mihi
       et tibi est, mulier!: [4180]1
     * Duplici igitur nomine post peccatum homo natura, indeque ab ortu
       suo, antequam ullum actuale peccatum in se admittat, iræ ac
       maledictioni divinæ obnoxius est; primum quidem ob : [4181]1
     * Ea est hominis post lapsum Adæ conditio, ut sese, naturalibus suis
       viribus et bonis operibus, ad fidem et invocationem Dei convertere
       ac præparare non possit. [The next clause, 'Quare absque gratia
       Dei,' etc., is taken almost verbatim from Augustine, De gratia et
       lib. arbitrio,: [4182]1

       habuit, sed ut apostolus loquitur: [4183]1
     * Ecclesiæ magno consensu apud nos docent, Decretum Nicænæ Synodi, de
       unitate essentiæ divinæ et de tribus personis, verum et sine ulla
       dubitatione credendum esse. Videlicet, quod sit una essentia
       divina, quæ et appellatur et est Deus, æternus, incorporeus
       impartibilis, immensa potentia, sapientia, bonitate, creator et
       conservator omnium: [4184]1
     * Ecclesia: [4185]1

     * Ecclesia est unus solus homo compositus ex pluribus membris, quorum
       Christus est caput, vita, subsistentia et persona; unus solus

     * Ego historiam vitæ et obitus ipsius, cujus spectator sedecim annos
       fui, bona fide persequutus testari mihi optimo jure posse videor,
       longe pulcherrimum vere Christianæ tum vitæ tum mortis exemplum in
       hoc homine cunctis propositum fuisse, quod tam facile sit
       calumniari, quam difficile fuerit æmulari.: [4196]1

     * Electi eligebantur antequam in utero conciperentur: mox igitur ut

     * Eminentissimi et reverendissimi Domini S.E. Rom. Cardinales::
       [4200]1
     * Enimvero falsum est, civilem cujusque cultus libertatem, itemque
       plenam potestatem omnibus attributam quaslibet opiniones
       cogitationesque palam publiceque manifestandi conducere ad
       populorum mores animosque facilius corrumpendos ac indifferentismi

     * Episcopale Romanum: [4202]1
     * Ergo non sine medio, licet non propter ullum meritum nostrum, sed
       in Christo et propter Christum nos elegit Deus, ut qui jam sunt in
       Christo insiti per fidem, illi ipsi etiam sint electi, reprobi

     * Est ergo fides recta ut credamus et confitemur quia Dominus ihesus
       christus Dei filius, deus pariter et homo est: [4206]1
     * Et ad veram unitatem Ecclesiæ satis est consentire de doctrina
       Evangelii et administratione Sacramentorum. Nec necesse est ubique
       esse similes traditiones humanas, seu ritus aut ceremonias, ab
       hominibus institutas. Sicut inquit Paulus: [4207]1

       orthodoxam atque catholicam: scientes, symbolis prædictis nihil

       hac die Dominus Noster Jesus Christus dedit pacem Apostolis suis,
       et ego, Vicarius ejus indignus, nomine suo do vobis pacem. Pax
       ista, prout scitis, expellit timorem. Pax ista, prout scitis,
       claudit aures sermonibus imperitis. Ah! ista pax vos comitetur
       omnibus diebus vitæ vestræ; sit ista pax vis in morte, sit ista pax

     * Hæc nostræ doctrinæ summa est, carnem Christi panem esse vivificum,
       quia dum fide in eam coalescimus, vere aninas nostras alit et
       pascit. Hoc nonnisi spiritualiter fieri docemus, quia hujus sacræ
       unitatis vinculum arcana est et incomprehensibilis Spiritus Sancti
       virtus: [4240]1
     * Habet Ecclesia ritus sive ceremonias statuendi jus, et in fidei
       controversiis auctoritatem, quamvis Ecclesiæ non licet quicquam
       instituere, quod verbo Dei scripto adversetur nec unum Scripturæ

     * I. Baptismum esse externum lavacrum aquæ, per quod interna quædam
       ablutio a peccatis tantum significetur.: [4256]1
     * I. Christum non pro omnibus hominibus, sed pro solis electis
       mortuum esse.: [4257]1
     * I. In Christo sunt duæ distinctæ Naturæ, divina et humana. Hæ
       manent in æternum inconfusæ et inseparabiles (seu indivisæ).:
       [4258]1
     * I. Quod Christus pro omnibus hominibus mortuus sit, et ceu Agnus
       Dei totius mundi peccata sustulerit.: [4259]1
     * I. Quod Deus Homo, et Homo Deus est, esse figuratam locutionem.:
       [4260]1
     * I. Quod supra posita verba Christi figurate intelligenda sint, et
       non secundum literam, sicut sonant.: [4261]1
     * I. Quod unum tantum Baptisma sit, et una ablutio, non quæ sordes
       corporis tollere solet, sed quæ nos a peccatis abluit.: [4262]1
     * I. Quod, verba Christi: 'Accipite et comedite, hoc est corpus meum:
       Bibite, hic est sanguis meus: [4263]1
     * II. Baptisimum non operari neque conferre regenerationem, fidem,
       gratiam Dei et salutem, sed tantum significare et obsignare ista. :
       [4264]1
     * II. Deum potissimam partem hominum ad damnationem æternam creasse,
       et nolle, ut potissima pars convertatur et vivat.: [4265]1
     * II. Hæ duæ Naturæ personaliter ita sunt invicem unitæ, ut unus
       tantum sit Christus, et una Persona.: [4266]1
     * II. Per Baptismum tanquam lavacrum illud regenerationis et
       renovationis Spiritus Sancti salvos nos facit Deus et operatur in
       nobis talem justitiam et purgationem a peccatis, ut qui in eo
       foedere et fiducia usque ad finem perseverat, non pereat, sed
       habeat vitam æternam.: [4267]1
     * II. Quod Deus neminem ad condemnationem condiderit, sed velit, ut
       omnes homines salvi fiant et ad agnitionem veritatis perveniant,
       propterea omnibus mandat, ut Filium suum Christum in Evangelio
       audiant, et per hunc auditum promittit virtutem et operationem
       Spiritus Sancti ad conversionem et salutem. : [4268]1
     * II. Quod humana Natura cum divina non in re et veritate, sed tantum
       nomine et verbis communionem habeat.: [4269]1
     * II. Quod in Coena tantum nuda signa sint, corpus autem Christi tam
       procul a pane, quam supremum coelum a terra. : [4270]1
     * II. Quod in Sacramento duæ res sint, quæ exhibentur et simul
       accipiuntur: una terrena, quæ est panis et vinum; et una coelestis,
       quæ est corpus et sanguis Christi.: [4271]1
     * III. Electos et regenitos non posse fidem et Spiritum Sanctum
       amittere, aut damnari, quamvis omnis generis grandia peccata et
       flagitia committant.: [4272]1
     * III. Non omnes, qui aqua baptizantur, consequi eo ipso gratiam
       Christi aut donum fidei sed tantum electos.: [4273]1
     * III. Omnes, qui in Christum Jesum baptizati sunt, in mortem ejus
       baptizati sunt, et per Baptismum cum ipso in mortem ejus consepulti
       sunt, et Christum induerunt.: [4274]1
     * III. Propter hanc personalem Unionem recte dicitur, atque in re et
       veritate ita se habet, quod Deus Homo, et Homo Deus sit, quod Maria
       Filium Dei genuerit, et quod Deus nos per proprium suum sanguinem
       redemerit.: [4275]1
     * III. Quod Christus illic præsens sit tantum virtute et operatione
       sua, et non corpore suo. Quemadmodum sol splendore et operatione
       sua in terris præsens et efficax est, corpus autem solare superius
       in coelo existit. : [4276]1
     * III. Quod Deo impossibile sit ex tota omnipotentia sua præstare, ut
       corpus Christi naturale simul et instantanee in pluribus, quam in
       unico loco sit.: [4277]1
     * III. Quod hæc Unio, Exhibitio et Sumptio fiat hic inferius in
       terris, non superius in coelis.: [4278]1
     * III. Quod multi homines propria culpa pereant: alii, qui Evangelium
       de Christo nolunt audire, alii, qui iterum excidunt gratia, sive
       per errores contra fundamentum, sive per peccata contra
       conscientiam.: [4279]1
     * IV. Baptismus est lavacrum illud regenerationis, propterea, quia in
       eo renascimur denuo et Spiritu Adoptionis obsignamur ex gratia
       (sive gratis).: [4280]1
     * IV. Corpus Christi esse typicum corpus, quod pane et vino tantam
       significetur et præfiguretur. : [4281]1
     * IV. Eos vero, qui electi non sunt, necessario damnari, nec posse
       pervenire ad salutem, etiamsi millies baptizarentur, et quotidie ad
       Eucharistiam accederent, præterea vitam tam sancte atque inculpate
       ducerent, quantum unquam fieri potest.: [4282]1
     * IV. Per hanc Unionem personalem, et quæ eam secuta est,
       exaltationem, Christus secundum carnem ad dexteram Dei collocatus
       est, et accepit omnem potestatem in coelo et in terra, factusque
       est particeps omnis divinæ majestatis, honoris, potentiæ et
       gloriæ.: [4283]1
     * IV. Quod Christus secundum humanam Naturam per exaltationem suam
       tantnm creata dona et finitam potentiam acceperit, non omnia sciat
       aut possit.: [4284]1
     * IV. Quod exhibeatur et accipiatur verum et naturale corpus Christi,
       quod in cruce pependit, et verus ac naturalis sanguis, qui ex
       Christi latere fluxit.: [4285]1
     * IV. Quod omnes peccatores poenitentiam agentes in gratiam
       recipiantur, et nemo excludatur. etsi peccata ejus rubeant ut
       sanguis; quandoquidem Dei misericordia major est, quam peccata
       totius mundi, et Deus omnium suorum operum miseretur. : [4286]1
     * IV. Regenerationem non fieri in, vel cum Baptismo, sed postea demum
       crescente aetate, imo et multis in senectute demum contingere. :
       [4287]1
     * Id apte dicitur auspicanti a verbo, ne adversetur, ne repugnet
       verbo.: [4288]1
     * Id autem, quod spectat ad numerum suffragiorum requisitum, ut
       quæstiones dogmaticæ solvantur, in quo quidem rei summa est
       totiusque Concilii cardo vertitur, ita grave est, ut nisi
       admitteretur, quod reverenter et enixe postulamus, conscientia
       nostra intolerabili pondere premeretur: timeremus, ne Concilii
       oecumenici character in dubium vocari posset; ne ansa hostibus
       proeberetur Sanctam Sedem et Concilium impetendi, sicque demum apud
       populum Christianum hujus Concilii auctoritas labefactaretur, quasi
       veritate et libertate caruerit: quod his turbatissimis temporibus
       tanta esset calamitas, ut pejor excogitari nulla possit.: [4289]1
     * Id extra controversiam positum habemus, totam in eo: [4290]1
     * Idem Christus palam est rediturus ut judicet vivos et mortuos,
       etc., juxta Symbolum Apostolorum.: [4291]1
     * Idem Christus palam est rediturus, ut judicet vivos et mortuos,
       etc., juxta Symbolum Apostolorum.: [4292]1
     * Idem descendit ad inferos, et vere resurrexit tertia die, deinde
       ascendit ad coelos, ut sedeat ad dexteram Patris, et perpetuo
       regnet et dominetur omnibus creaturis, sanctificet credentes in
       ipsum, misso in corda eorum Spiritu Sancto, qui regat, consoletur
       ac vivificet eos, ac defendat adversus diabolum et vim peccati.:
       [4293]1
     * Illorum etiam videri debet scrupulosa superstitio, qui Dei gratiam
       et Spiritum Sanctum tantopere cum sacramentorum elementis
       colligant, ut plane affirment, nullum Christianorum infantem
       salutem esse consecuturum, qui prius morte fuerit occupatus, quam
       ad Baptismum adduci potuerit; quod longe secus habere judicamus.:
       [4294]1
     * Illud Symbolum olim, teste Honorio, quotidie est decantatum, jam
       vero diebus Dominicis in totius coetus frequentia recitatur, ut
       sanctæ fidei confessio ea die apertius celebretur: [4295]1
     * In oecumenico hoc Concilio ea omnia accuratissime examine sunt
       perpendenda ac statuenda, quæ hisce præsertim asperrimis temporibus
       majorem Dei gloriam, et fidei integritatem, divinique cultus
       decorem, sempiternamque hominum salutem, et utriusque Cleri
       disciplinam ejusque salutarem solidamque culturam, atque
       ecclesiasticarum legum observantiam, morumque emendationem, et
       christianam juventutis institutionem, et communem omnium pacem et
       concordiam in primis respiciunt. Atque etiam intentissimo studio
       curandum est, ut, Deo bene juvante, omnia ab Ecclesia et civili
       societate amoveantur mala, ut miseri errantes ad rectum veritatis,
       justitiæ salutisque tramitem reducantur, ut vitiis erroribusque
       eliminatis, augusta nostra religio ejusque salutifera doctrina
       ubique terrarum reviviscat, et quotidie magis propagetur et
       dominetur, atque ita pietas, honestas, probitas, justitia, caritas
       omnesque Christianæ virtutes cum maxima humanæ societatis utilitate
       vigeant et efflorescant.: [4296]1
     * In autographo Whitakeri verba erant, "in iis qui semel ejus

       secutus, fidei Catholicæ probationes ex traditione potius quam ex
       Scripturarum interpretatione quærendas duxi; quæ interpretatio,
       juxta Tertullianum magis apta est ad veritatem obumbitandum quam
       demonstrandum.: [4313]1

       quidem hominem integrum creare. : [4314]1
     * Ita nunc obruor curis ac negotiis, mi Calvine! ut nihil possim

       successorem esse beati Petri principis Apostolorum, et verum
       Christi vicarium, totiusque ecclesiæ caput et omnium Christianorum
       patrem et doctorem existere.: [4317]1

     * Iterum quæro, unde factum est ut tot gentes una cum liberis eorum
       infantibus æternæ morti involveret lapsus Adæ absque remedio, nisi
       quia Deo ita visum est? Hic obmutescere oportet tam dicaces alioqui
       linguas. Decretum quidem horribile, fateor; infitiari tamen nemo
       poterit quin præsciverit Deus, quem exitum esset habiturus homo,
       antequam ipsum conderet, et ideo præsciverit, quia decreto suo sic
       ordinarat. In præscientiam Dei si quis hic invehatur, temere et
       inconsulte impingit. Quid enim, quæso, est cur reus agatur
       coelestis judex quia non ignoraverit quod futurum erat? In
       prædestinationem competit, si quid est vel justæ vel speciosæ
       querimoniæ. Nec absurdum videri debet quod dico, Deum non modo
       primi hominis casum, et in eo posterorum ruinam prævidisse, sed
       arbitrio quoque suo dispensasse. Ut enim ad ejus sapientiam
       pertinet, omnium quæ futura sunt esse præscium, sic ad potentiam,
       omnia manu sua regere ac moderari.: [4323]1
     * Jesu Christi gratia, principium efficax boni cujuscunque generis,
       necessaria est ad omne opus bonum; absque illa non solum nihil fit,
       sed nec fieri potest.: [4324]1

     * Justificamur ut nova et spirituali vita vivamus. . . . Ipsius opus
       sumus, conditi ad bona opera: [4329]1
     * Lapsus est enim primus homo, quia Dominus ita expedire censuerat;
       cur censuerit, nos latet. Certum tamen est non aliter censuisse,
       nisi quia videbat, nominis sui gloriam inde merito illustrari. Unde
       mentionem gloriæ Dei audis, illic justitiam cogita. Justum enim
       esse oportet quod laudem meretur. Cadit igitur homo, Dei
       providentia sic ordinante, sed suo vitio cadit. . . . Propria ergo
       malitia, quam acceptrat a Domino puram naturam corrupit; sua ruina
       totam posteritatem in exitium secum attraxit.: [4330]1

     * Majestatem divinam tempore carnis suæ in hoc seculo dissimulavit
       seu ea sese: [4339]1
     * Mandavimus iis, qui concionandi apud nos munere fungebantur, ut
       nihil aliud quam quæ sacris literis aut continentur, aut certe
       nituntur, e suggestu docerent. Videbatur namque nobis haud
       indignum, eo in illo tanto discrimine confugere, quo confugerunt
       olim et semper, non solum sanctissimi Patres, Episcopi, et
       Principes, sed quilibet etiam privati, nempe ad authoritatem
       Scripturæ arcanæ. Ad quam nobiliores Thessalonicensium auditum
       Christi Evangelium explorasse, divus Lucas cum laude illorum
       memorat, in qua Paulus summo studio versari suum Timotheum voluit,
       sine cuius authoritate, nulli Pontifices suis decretis obedientiam,
       nulli patres suis scriptis fidem, nulli denique Principes suis
       legibus authoritatem unquam postularunt, ex qua demum ducendas
       sacras conciones, et magnum Sacri Imperii concilium Nurembergæ,
       anno Christi M.D.XXIII. celebratum sancivit. Si enim verum divus
       Paulus testatus est, per divinam Scripturam hominem Dei penitus
       absolvi, atque ad omne opus bonum instrui, nihil poterit is
       veritatis Christianæ, nihil doctrinæ salutaris desiderare,
       Scripturam qui consulere religiose studeat.: [4340]1

     * Missale Romanum: [4345]1
     * Mittitur tibi Apologia nostra, quanquam verius Confessio est.:
       [4346]1
     * Nam communicationem idiomatum ex Scripturis petitam et ab universa
       vetustate in explicandis componendisque Scripturarum locis in
       speciem pugnantibus usurpatam, religiose et reverenter recipimus et
       usurpamus.: [4347]1

       pacis; quia quicunque illuc confugerit, cuiuscunque criminis
       obnoxius, subsidium invenit: [4352]1
     * Nec vero Augustanam Confessionem repudio, cui pridem volens ac
       libens subscript, sicut eam auctor ipse interpretatus est: [4353]1
     * Nec veteris nec novi Testamenti hominibus contingat æterna salus
       propter meritum operum Legis, sed tantum propter meritum Domini
       nostri Jesu Christi, per fidem. : [4354]1
     * Nemo potest esse mediator sui ipsius.: [4355]1
     * Neque mihi dubium est, quin a prima statim ecclesiæ origine,
       adeoque ab ipso Apostolorum seculo instar publicæ et omnium
       calculis receptæ confessionis obtinuerit: [4356]1
     * Nihil de fide, nihil de amore Dei, nihil de remissione peccatorum,
       nihil de gratia, nihil de justificatione, nihil de veris operibus
       disserunt; aut si certe disserunt, omnia calumniantur, omnia
       labefactant, omnia suis legibus, hoc est sophisticis coërcent. Vos
       rogo, quotquot hic adestis, ut has hæreses, has in Deum contumelias
       numquam æquo animo feratis.: [4357]1
     * Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum, seu actionem divinitus
       institutam: [4358]1
     * Nihil spatiosius Ecclesia Dei; quia omnes electi et justi omnium
       seculorum illam componunt: [4359]1
     * Non Placet: [4360]1

       mereatur improbitas adversarioram.: [4364]1
     * Non errat illa, quamdiu innititur petræ Christo et fundamento
       Prophetarum et Apostolorum. Nec mirum, si erret, quoties deserit
       illum, qui solus est veritas.: [4365]1
     * Non est autem sentiendum, quod iis bonis operibus, quæ per nos
       facimus, in judicio Dei, ubi agitur de expiatione peccatorum, et
       placatione divinæ iræ, ac merito æternæ salutis, confidendem sit.
       Omnia enim bona opera, quæ nos facimus, sunt imperfecta, nec
       possunt severitatem divini judicii ferre.: [4366]1
     * Non transscribimus diabolo Mariam conditione nascendi, sed ideo
       quia ipsa conditio solvitur gratia renascendi,: [4367]1

     * O Luthere, quam paucos tuæ præstantiæ imitatores, quam multas vero
       sanctæ: tuæ jactantiæ simias reliquisti!: [4374]1
     * O Philippe Melanchthon! Te enim appello, qui apud Deum cum Christo
       vivis, nosque illic expectas, donec tecum in beatam quietem
       colligamur. Dixisti centies, quum fessus laboribus et molestiis
       oppressus caput familiariter in sinum meum deponeres: Utinam,
       utinam moriar in hoc sinu. Ego vero millies postea optavi nobis
       contingere, ut simul essemus. Certe animosior fuisses ad obeunda
       certamina, et ad spernendam invidiam, falsasque criminationes pro
       nihilo ducendas fortior. Hoc quoque modo cohibita fuisset multorum
       improbitas, quibus ex tua mollitie, quam vocabant, crevit
       insultandi audacia.: [4375]1
     * O Philippe, o inquam Philippe noster, redi per immortalem Christum
       ad pristinum candorem, ad pristinam tuam sinceritatem! non
       languefacito ista tua formidine, pusillanimitate et inepta
       moderatione nostrorum animos tantopere! Non aperito hac ratione ad
       Papatus recurrentem impietatem ac Idolomanias fenestram ac januam!
       Non sis tantorum in Ecclesia offendiculorum autor! Ne sinas tua tam
       egregia scripta, dicta, facta, quibus mirifice de Ecclesia hactenus
       meritus es, isto condonationis, moderationis, novationis nævo ad
       eum modum deformari! Cogita, quantum animi ista nostra carnis ac
       rationis consilia et adversariis addant et nostris adimant.!
       Perpende, quam placari etiam istis condonationibus adversarii
       nostri non queant, qui totius Papatus doctrinam et omnes ex cequo
       impios cultus reposcunt et ex nostra levitate spem concipiunt se
       hac in re facile voti compotes futuros. Detestatur Dominus apud
       Jeremiam eos, qui manus pessimormn confortant, ut non convertatur
       unusquisque a malitia sua. Cur igitur in tam ardua causa non tales
       nos gerimus ut hujusmodi detestatio competere in nos haud possit?
       qua perversitate arundo huc illuc ventis agitata dici quam Johannis
       constantiam imitari malumus! . . . Proinde Te, o noster Philippe,
       iterum atque iterum per ilium ipsum Christum redemptorem nostrum et
       brevi futurum judicem rogamus, ut professionis tuæ memor talem te
       cum reliquis Vitebergensibus jam geras, qualem Te ab initio hujus
       causæ ad Electoris captivitatem usque gessisti, hoc est, ut ea
       sentias, dicas, scribas, agas, quæ Philippum, Christianum Doctorem
       decent, non aulicum Philosophum.: [4376]1
     * Obedientia nostra, hoc est, justitia bonæ conscientiæ seu operum,
       quæ Deus nobis præcipit, necessario sequi debet reconciliationem. .
       . . Si vis in vitam ingredi, serva mandata: [4377]1
     * Obiit auriga et currus Israel, qui rexit ecclesiam in hac ultima
       senecta mundi,: [4378]1
     * Obscuritas sancti verbi Dei non est laicis ratio dispensandi se
       ipsos ab ejus lectione.: [4379]1
     * Omnes Christianos etiam atque etiam hortamur et obsecramus, ut ad
       unicum Christi ovile redire festinent.: [4380]1
     * Omnes, omnes illum damnamus! damnamus!: [4381]1
     * Omnes, quos Deus vult salvare per Christum, salvantur
       infallibiliter.: [4382]1
     * Omnia necessario evenire Scripturæ docent. . . . Nec in externis
       nec in internis operibus ulla est libertas, sed eveniunt omnia
       juxta destinationem divinam. . . . Tollit omnem libertatem
       voluntatis nostræ prædestinatio divina.: [4383]1
     * Opera sequuntur justificatam, non præcedunt justificandum.: [4384]1

       [4386]1
     * Pati potius in pace excommunicationem et anathema injustum, quam
       prodere veritatem, est imitari sanctum Paulum; tantum abest, ut sit
       erigere se contra auctoritatem aut scindere unitatem.: [4387]1
     * Peccator non est liber, nisi ad malum, sine gratia Liberatoris.:
       [4388]1
     * Peccatum originale non proprie peccatum est, non enim est facinus
       contra legem. Morbus igitur est proprie et conditio.: [4389]1
     * Per decem minimum annos prandio abstinuit, ut nullum omnino cibum
       extra statam coenæ horam sumeret.: [4390]1

     * Prædicatio legis ad pænitentiam.: [4403]1
     * Præscientiam : [4404]1
     * Præsentia hæc assumtæ naturæ in Christo non est naturalis, vel
       essentialis, sed voluntaria et liberrima, dependens a voluntate et
       potentia Filii Dei, h. e. ubi se hmnana natura adesse velle certo
       verbo tradidit, promisit et asseveravit.: [4405]1
     * Præter apostolicas post Christi tempora chartas, Huic peperere
       libro sæcula nulla parem.: [4406]1
     * Præter superiorem manducationem spiritualem est et sacramentalis
       manducatio corporis Domini, qua fidelis non tantum spiritualiter et
       interne participat vero corpore et sanguine Domini, sed foris etiam
       accedendo ad mensam Domini accipit visibile corporis et sanguinis
       Domini sacramentum.: [4407]1
     * Præterea sedulo docemus, Deum non promiscue vim suam exserere in
       omnibus qui sacramenta recipiunt: sed tantum in electis. Nam
       quemadmodum non alios in fidem illuminat, quam quos præordinavit ad
       vitam, ita arcana Spiritus sui virtute efficit, ut percipiant
       electi quod offerunt sacramenta.: [4408]1
     * Præterea singula verba in ista Christi ad Petrum allocutione de

       accepissent, ut pro ipso legatione fungentes, in universum mundum
       proficiscerentur, atque omni creaturæ Evangelium prædicarent:
       Christianæ fidei formulam componendam censuerunt, ut scilicet id

     * Quando surgitis, quando vos ad somnum collocatis, reddite Symbolum
       vestrum; reddite Domino. . . . Ne dicatis, Dixi heri, dixi hodie,
       quotidie dico, teneo illud bene. Commemora fidem tuam: inspice te.
       Sit tanquam speculum tibi Symbolum tuum. Ibi te vide si credis
       omnia quæ te credere confiteris, et gaude quotidie in fide tua.:
       [4423]1
     * Quandoquidem omnia, quæ eveniunt, necessario juxta divinam
       prædestinationem eveniunt, nulla est voluntatis nostræ libertas.:
       [4424]1
     * Quemadmodum substantia solis producit radios, et a sole et radiis
       procedit lumen: ita Pater generat Filium seu Verbum ejus, et:

     * Qui ecclesiam non habet matrem, Deum non habet patrem,: [4428]1
     * Qui foris vera fide sacramentum percipit, idem ille non signum
       duntaxat percipit, sed re ipsa quoque, ut diximus, fruitur.:
       [4429]1
     * Qui non ducit vitam dignam filio Dei et membro Christi, cessat
       interius habere Deum pro Patre et Christum pro capite.: [4430]1

       quæ cunctas hereses interemit in universo mundo, quæque omnium
       nostrum amantissima Mater: [4435]1
     * Quod Christi corpus,: [4436]1

       integritatem relictam, ut possit sese, naturalibus suis viribus et
       bonis operibus, ad fidem et invocationem Dei convertere ac
       præparare, haud obscure pugnat cum Apostolica doctrina, et cum vero
       Ecclesiæ Catholicæ consensu.: [4437]1
     * Quod genus hoc pugnæ est? ubi victus gaudet uterque,: [4438]1
     * Quod hæc Ecclesia habeat jus interpretandæ Scripturæ.: [4439]1
     * Quod hæc Ecclesia habeat jus judicandi de omnibus doctrinis, juxta
       illud, Probate spiritus, num ex Deo sint.: [4440]1

     * Ratio Disciplinæ: [4442]1
     * Regula interpetrandi Scripturas nobis imposita, hæc est: eas contra
       unanimem Patrum consensum non interpetrari. Si unquam detur
       consensus iste unanimis dubitari possit. Eo tamen deficiente,
       regula ista videtur nobis legem imponere majorem, qui ad
       unanimitatem accedere videretur, patrum numerum, in suis Scripturæ
       interpretationibus sequendi.: [4443]1

       vocare, tantopere plurimis etiam exteris populis probatum, ut non
       modo vernaculis plurimis linguis, utpote Germanica, Anglica,
       Scotica, Belgica, Hispanica, sed etiam Hebraice ab Immanuele
       Tremellio Judæo Christiano, et Græce ab Henrico Stephano legatur

       IV. sub poenis in eis constitutionibus contentis, quas innovat:

     * Si Lutherum virum maximum, si Zwinglium civem Christianum nulli

       Calvinum jure vocaris : [4474]1
     * Si Lyra non lyrasset, Lutherus non saltasset.: [4475]1
     * Si enim corpus Christi ubique est, erit etiam ante usum in vane.:
       [4476]1
     * Si igitur ante conceptum sui sanctificari minime potuit, quoniam
       non erat; sed nec in ipso quidem conceptu, propter peccatum quod
       inerat: restat ut post conceptum in utero jam existens
       sanctificationem accepisse credatur, quæ excluso peccato sanctam
       fecerit nativitatem, non tamen et conceptionem: [4477]1
     * Si mihi concedatis, ut in alia loco vivam, respondebo illis
       indoctis sycophantis et vere et graviter, et dicam utilia
       ecclesiæ.: [4478]1
     * Si non jurabis non regnabis: [4479]1
     * Si nos servaremus : [4480]1
     * Si posterior non fuisset, prior non stetisset.: [4481]1
     * Si quid in hoc confessione desiderabitur, parati sumus latiorem
       informationem, Deo volente, juxta Scripturas exhibere.: [4482]1
     * Si quid vero, in hisce Doctrinæ Christianæ capitibus, dubitationis
       aut controversiæ de genuino eorum sensu exoriatur, profitemur
       porro, nos amplecti ceu interpretationem Scripturarum certam et
       indubitatam, Symbolum Nicænum et Constantinopolitanum, iisdem plane
       verbis, quibus in Synodi Tridentinæ Sessione tertia, tanquam
       Principium illud, in quo omnes, qui fidem Christi profitentur,
       necessario conveniunt, et Fundamentum firmum et unicum, contra quod
       portæ inferorum nunquam prævalebunt, proponitur.: [4483]1
     * Si quis autem huic Nostræ definitioni contradicere, quod Deus
       avertat, præsumpserit; anathema sit.: [4484]1
     * Si vel unicus ejusmodi error deprehenderetur, appareret omnes
       adductas probationes in nihilum redactum iri.: [4485]1
     * Sicut erravit Ecclesia Hierosolymitana, Alexandrina et Antiochena:
       ita et erravit Ecclesia Romana, non solum quoad agenda et
       cæremoniarum ritus, verum in his etiam quæ credenda sunt.: [4486]1
     * Sine gratia nihil amare possumus, nisi ad nostram condemnationem.:
       [4487]1
     * Solus : [4488]1
     * Somni pene nullius,: [4489]1
     * Spiritum Sanctum, paracletum, sanctificatorem fidei eorum qui
       credunt in Patrem et Filium et Spiritum Sanctum.: [4490]1
     * Spiritus Sanctus a Patre : [4491]1
     * Spiritus Sanctus, a Patre et Filio procedens, ejusdem est cum Patre
       et Filio essentiæ, majestatis, et gloriæ, verus ac æternus Deus.:
       [4492]1
     * Spiritus sui virtute Christus locorum distantiam superat ad vitam
       nobis e sua carne inspirandam: [4493]1
     * Statura fuit mediocri, colore subpallido et nigricante, oculis ad
       mortem usque limpidis, quique ingenii sagacitatem testarentur:
       cultu corporis neque culto neque sordido, sed qui singularem
       modestiam deceret: victu sic temperato, ut a sordibus et ab omni
       luxu longissime abesset: cibi parcissimi, ut qui multos annos semel
       quotidie cibum sumpserit, vintriculi imbecillitatem causatus: somni
       pæne nullius: memoriæ incredibilis, ut quos semel aspexisset multis
       post annis statim agnosceret, et inter dictandum sæpe aliquot horas
       interturbatus statim ad dictata nullo commonefaciente rediret, et
       eorum, quæ ipsum nosse muneris sui causa interesset, quantumvis
       multiplicibus et infinitis negotiis oppressus, nunquam tamen
       oblivisceretur. Judicii, quibuscunque de rebus consuleretur, tam
       puri et exacti, ut pæne vaticinari sæpe sit visus, nec aberasse
       meminerim, qui consilium ipsius esset sequutus. Facundiæ contemptor
       et verborum parcus, sed minime ineptus scriptor, et quo nullus ad
       hunc diem theologus (absit verbo invidia) purius, gravius,
       judiciosius denique scripsit, quum tamen tam multa scripserit, quam
       nemo vel nostra vel patrum memoria.: [4494]1
     * Subscripsimus omnes, qui in hoc coetu interfuimus, et hujus
       Academiæ sigillo publico obsignavimus.: [4495]1
     * Sufficit nobis ea duntaxat discere quæ ipse verbo suo nos docet,
       neque hos fines transilire fas esse ducimus.: [4496]1
     * Summo igitur gauaio,: [4497]1
     * Symbolum Græce et indicium dici potest et collatio, hoc est, quod
       plures in unum conferunt: [4498]1
     * Symbolum fidei et spei nostræ, quod ab apostolis traditum, non
       scribitur in charta et atramento, sed in tabulis cordis carnalibus:

     * Tantum propter: [4500]1
     * Tantum propter meritum Domini ac Servatoris nostri Jesu Christi,
       per fidem, non propter opera et merita nostra, justi coram Deo
       reputamur.: [4501]1
     * Tempus deplorabile, quo creditur honorari Deus persequendo
       veritatem ejusque discipulos! . . . Frequenter credimus sacrificare
       Deo impium, et sacrificamus diabolo Dei servum.: [4502]1
     * Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.: [4503]1
     * Tota antiquitas declarans hanc propositionem: Christus est ubique,
       sic declarat: Christus est ubique: [4504]1
     * Tota pulchra es, amica mea, et macula non est in te.: [4505]1
     * Totum scholarum publicarum regimen, in quibus juventus christianæ
       alicujus Reipublicæ instituitur, episcopalibus dumtaxat seminariis
       aliqua ratione exceptis, potest ac debet attribui auctoritati
       civili,: [4506]1
     * Trahit Deus hominem, : [4507]1
     * Tunc edita est a Calvino Christianæ doctrinæ quædam veluti formula,
       vixdum emergenti e papatus sordibus Genevensi Ecclesiæ accommodata.
       Addidit etiam Catechismum,: [4508]1
     * Ubicunque est Deitas, ibi etiam est humanitas Christi.: [4509]1
     * Una fides, unum Baptisma, unus Deus et Pater omnium, etc.: [4510]1
     * Unanimi quoque . . . consensu placuit, ut quicquid publica hæc
       transactio, in eaque decisio gravaminum ceteris Calholicis, et:
       [4511]1
     * Unde Augustinus et alii dicunt: Christi corpus est in certo loco. .
       . Cavendum est, ne ita astruamus divinitatem hominis Christi, ut
       veritatem corporis auferamus.: [4512]1
     * Unde enim scimus quid ei: [4513]1
     * Unus est vivus et verus Deus æternus, incorporeus impartibilis,:
       [4514]1
     * Ut citius imbibant venenum: [4515]1
     * Ut extra arcam Noë non erat ulla salus, pereunte mundo in diluvio,
       ita credimus, extra Christum, qui se electis in Ecclesia fruendum
       proebet, nullam esse salutem certam: et proinde docemus, vivere
       volentes non oportere separari a vera Christi Ecclesia.: [4516]1
     * Utile et necessarum est omni tempore, omni loco, et omni personarum
       generi, studere el cognoscere spiritum, pietatem et mysteria sacræ
       Scripturæ.: [4517]1
     * V. Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et Spiritu, non potest introire
       in regnum coelorum. Casus tamen necessitatis hoc ipso non
       intenditur.: [4518]1
     * V. Quod Christus secundum Humanitatem absens regnet, sicut Rex
       Hispaniæ novas Insulas regit. : [4519]1
     * V. Quod corpus et sanguis Christi non fide tantum spiritualiter,
       quod etiam extra Coenam fieri potest, sed cum pane et vino
       oraliter, modo tamen imperscrutabili et supernaturali, illic in
       Coena accipiantur, idque in pignus et certificationem
       resurrectionis nostrorum corporum ex mortuis.: [4520]1
     * V. Quod sola fide, quæ in coelum se elevet, et non ore, accipiatur.
       : [4521]1
     * V. Salutem non dependere a Baptismo, atque ideo Baptismum in causa
       necessitatis non permittendum esse in Ecclesia, sed in defectu
       ordinarii Ministri Ecclesiæ permittendum esse, ut infans sine
       Baptismo moriatur. : [4522]1
     * VI. Christianorum infantes jam ante Baptismum esse sanctos, ab
       utero matris, imo adhuc in utero materno constitutes esse in
       foedere vitae æternæ cæteroqui Sacrum Baptisma ipsis conferri non
       posse. : [4523]1
     * VI. Quicquid de carne nascitur, caro est, et natura sumus omnes
       filii iræ divinæ: quia ex semine peccaminoso sumus geniti, et in
       peccatis concipimur omnes.: [4524]1
     * VI. Quod damnabilis idololatria sit, si fiducia et fides cordis in
       Christum non solum secundum divinam, sed etiam secundum humanam
       ipsius Naturam collocetar, et honor adorationis ad utramque
       dirigatur.: [4525]1
     * VI. Quod oralis perceptio corporis et sanguinis Christi non solum
       fiat a dignis, verum etiam ab indignis, qui sine poenitentia et
       vera fide accedunt; eventu tamen diverso. A dignis enim percipitur
       ad salutem, ab indignis autem ad judicium.: [4526]1
     * VI. Quod soli digni illud accipiant, indigni autem, qui talem fidem
       evolantem sursum in coelos non habent, nihil præter panem et vinum
       accipiant. : [4527]1
     * Variata: [4528]1
     * Verbum Dei verum hominem esse factum.: [4529]1 [4530]2
     * Verius cogitatur Deus quam dicitur, verius est quam cogitatur:
       [4531]1
     * Vi contractus mere civilis potest inter Christianos constare veri
       nominis matrimonium; falsumque est, aut contractum matrimonii inter
       Christianos semper esse sacramentum, aut nullum esse contractum, si
       sacramentum excludatur.: [4532]1
     * Videtis,: [4533]1
     * Vincite! Cedo; nihil pugno de ritibus illis, et maxime opto, ut
       dulcis sit ecclesiarum concordia. Fateor etiam hac in re a me
       peccatum esse, et a Deo veniam peto, quod non procul fugi
       insidiosas illas deliberationes. Sed illa quæ mihi falsa a te et a
       Gallo objiciuntur, refutabo.: [4534]1
     * Virgo ipsa . . . est in iniquitatibus concepta, et in peccatis
       concepit eam mater ejus, et cum originali peccato nata est, quoniam
       et ipsa in Adam peccavit, in quo omnes peccaverunt.: [4535]1
     * Virgo regia falso non eget honore, veris cumalata honorum titulis.
       .  .  . Non est hoc Virginem honorare sed honori detraher.  .  .  .
       Præsumpta novitas mater temeritatis, soror superstitionis, filia
       levitatis.: [4536]1
     * Vix quatuor responderunt negative quoad definitionem, et ex hic
       ipsis tres brevi mutarunt sententiam.: [4537]1
     * Vocatio externa quæ per præconium Evangelicum fit, etiam vocantis
       Dei respectu, seria et sincera est. . . . Neque voluntas illa
       respectu eorum, qui vocationi non parent, inefficax est, quia
       semper Deus id, quod volens intendit, assequitur,: [4538]1
     * Voluntas, quam gratia non prævenit, nihil habet luminis, nisi ad
       aberrandum, ardoris, nisi ad se præcipitandum, virium nisi ad se
       vulnerandum; est capax omnis mali et incapax ad omne bonum.:

     * Zwinglius misit huc confessionem impressam typis. Dicas simpliciter

       veteres errores palam renovat. De ceremoniis loquitur valde
       helvetice, hoc est barbarissime, velle se omnes ceremonias esse

     * Bekenntnisse, an welchen sich das geistige Leben ganzer Völker

     * Beweis aus der heiligen Schrift dass die Sacramentirer nicht

     * Calvin's Lehrbuch der christlichen Religion ist ohne Frage das
       hervorragendste und bedeutendste Erzeugniss, welches die
       reformatorische Literatur des sechszehnten Jahrhunderts auf dem
       Gebiete der Dogmatik aufzuweisen hat. Schon ein oberflächlicher
       Vergleich lässt uns den gewaltigen Fortschritt erkennen, den es
       gegenüber den bisherigen Leistungen auf diesem Gebiete bezeichnet.
       Statt der unvollkommenen, nach der einen oder andern Seite
       unzulänglichen Versuche Melanchthon's, Zwingli's, Farel's erhalten
       wir aus Calvin's Hand das Kunstwerk eines, wenn auch nicht
       harmonisch in sich abgeschlossenen, so doch wohlgegliederten,
       durchgebildeten Systems, das in allen seinen Theilen die leitenden
       Grundgedanken widerspiegelt und von vollständiger Beherrschung des
       Stoffes zeugt. Es hatte eine unverkennbare Berechtigung, wenn man
       den Verfasser der Institution als den Aristoteles der Reformation
       bezeichnete. Die ausserordentliche Belesenheit in der biblischen
       und patristischen Literatur, wie sie schon in den früheren Ausgaben
       des Werkes hervortritt, setzt in Erstaunen. Die Methode ist
       lichtvoll und klar, der Gedankengang streng logisch, überall
       durchsichtig, die Eintheilung und Ordnung des Stoffes dem leitenden
       Grundgedanken entsprechend; die Darstellung schreitet ernst und
       gemessen vor und nimmt, obschon in den späteren Ausgaben mehr
       gelehrt als anziehend, mehr auf den Verstand als auf das Gemüth
       berechnet, doch zuweilen einen höheren Schwung an. Calvin's
       Institution enthält Abschnitte, die dem Schönsten, was von Pascal
       und Bossuet geschrieben worden ist, an die Seite gestellt werden
       können: Stellen, wie jene über die Erhabenheit der heiligen
       Schrift, über das Elend des gefallenen Menschen, über die Bedeutung
       des Gebetes, werden nie verfehlen, auf den Leser einen tiefen
       Eindruck zu machen. Auch von den katholischen Gegnern Calvin's sind
       diese Vorzüge anerkannt und manche Abschnitte seines Werkes sogar
       benutzt worden. Man begreift es vollkommen, wenn er selbst mit dem
       Gefühl der Befriedigung und des Stolzes auf sein Werk blickt und in
       seinen übrigen Schriften gern auf das "Lehrbuch" zurückverweist.:

     * Christliche, Widerholete, einmütige Bekenntnüs nachbenanter

     * Das Allgemeine Concil und seine Bedeutung für unsere Zeit,: [5069]1
     * Das Apostolicum ist hinsichtlich seiner jetzigen Form sowohl
       nachapostolisch, als selbst nachaugustinisch, aber hinsichtlich
       seines Inhalts ist es nicht nur voraugustinisch, sondern ganz und
       gar apostolisch--in diesen einfachen Satz lässt die Summe der
       einschlägigen kritisch patristischen Forschungsergebnisse sich
       kurzerhand zusammendrängen. Und die Wahrheit dieses Satzes, soweit
       er die Apostolicität des Inhalts behauptet, lässt sich bezüglich
       jedes einzelnen Gliedes oder Sätzchens, die am spätesten
       hinzugekommenen nicht ausgenommen, mit gleicher Sicherheit
       erhärten.: [5070]1
     * Das Ende ist die Einsetzung des Papstthums und Einstellung des
       Antichrists in den Tempel Christi, Stärkung der Gottlosen, dass sie
       über der Kirche Christi stolziren, Betrübung der Gottfürchtigen,
       item Schwächung, Einführung in Zweifel, Trennung und unzählige

       Verlauf,: [5075]1
     * Das eben ist seine Lehre, dass unser Erkennen nicht so weit reicht,
       und dass wir uns auch das Unbegreifliche und Unverständliche
       gefallen lassen müssen. . . . Er selbst spricht aus, dass ein
       Widerspruch für uns stehen bleibe, den wir nicht lösen können noch
       sollen.: [5076]1
     * Das ist um katholisch zu werden: [5077]1
     * Das letzte und das nächste Allgemeine Concil,: [5078]1
     * Das wage ich von meinen Dienern nicht zu fordern.: [5079]1
     * Dass Paulus in der Offenbarungsgeschichte Jesu Christi drei Stadien
       unterscheidet: das Stadium der Gottesgestalt, da der Logos beim
       Vater war; das Stadium der Knechtsgestalt, das mit der
       Selbstverleugnung Christi in der Menschwerdung begann und zur
       Erniedrigung am Kreuze fortging; das Stadium der Erhöhung, da im
       Namen Christi sich alle Knie beugen und ihn als Herrn bekennen.:
       [5080]1
     * Dass die Entäusserung: [5081]1
     * Dass die Propositio:: [5082]1
     * Der Gegensatz der melanchthonischen und der
       würtembergisch-brenzischen Christologie ist sonnenklar. Jene erbaut
       sich auf dem Gedanken, dass Gott wirklicher Mensch geworden ist,
       während diese sich um den Gedanken lagert, dass ein Mensch Gott
       geworden ist.: [5083]1
     * Der Glaube ist ein göttlich Werk in uns, das uns verwandelt und neu
       gebiert aus Gott und tödtet den alten Adam, macht uns ganz andere
       Menschen . . . und bringet den heiligen Geist mit sich. O! es ist
       ein lebendig, geschäftig, thätig, mächtig Ding um den Glauben, dass
       es unmöglich ist, dass er nicht ohne Unterlass sollte Gutes wirken;
       er fragt auch nicht, ob gute Werke zu thun sind, sondern ehe man
       fragt, hat er sie gethan, und ist immer im Thun. Weraber nicht
       solche Werke thut, der ist ein glaubloser Mensch. . . . Werke vom
       Glauben scheiden is so unmöglich als brennen und leuchten vom Feuer
       mag geschieden werden.: [5084]1
     * Der Grundgedanke, von dem der Gesetzgeber Genfs ausgeht, ist die
       Theokratie. Calvin will in Genf den Gottesstaat herstellen. Nur
       Einer ist ihm König und Herr in Staat und Kirche: Gott im Himmel.
       In seinem Namen herrscht jede irdische Gewalt. Gottes Herrscherruhm
       zu verkündigen, seine Majestät zu verherrlichen, seinen heiligen
       Willen zur Ausführung zu bringen und seine Bekenner zu heiligen,
       ist die gemeinsame Aufgabe von Staat und Kirche.: [5085]1
     * Der Katechismus, den Luther im Jahr: [5086]1
     * Der Papst und das Concil, von : [5087]1
     * Der altlestamentliche wie der neutestamentliche Bibelerklärer, der
       Lutheraner, wie der Unirte und Reformirte, der wissenschaftliche
       Exeget, wie der populäre Schriftausleger alle schöpften und
       schöpfen immer noch aus der Arbeit Calvins bei weitem das Meiste
       und Beste, was sie von Schrifterklärung aus dem
       Reformationszeitalter beibringen.: [5088]1
     * Der lose Pfaffe hat den Teufel nicht ausgetrieben: [5089]1
     * Der reformirte Lehrbegriff, consequent gegründet auf das
       Materialprincip schlechthiniger Abhängigkeit von Gott und von da
       aus das menschliche Thun beleuchtend, ohne dessen willensmässige
       Natur zu verkleinern, ist weniger durch seinen Determinismus
       anstössig geworden, als durch das dualistisch Particularistische
       der auf die Prädestination angewandten Weltansicht. Gerade dieses
       aber gehört der Weltansicht aller damaligen Confessionen gleich
       sehr an and folgt wirklich aus der Vorstellung, dass unser ewiges
       Loos beim irdischen Sterben entschieden sei, nur hienieden Erlöste
       selig werden, alle Andern aber verdammt bleiben. . . . Das Harte am
       reformirten Lehrbegriff ist der dualistische Particularismus, der
       aber allen Confessionen gemein durch die reformirte Consequenz nur
       heller in's Licht gestellt wird, wodurch allein, falls er irrig
       wäre, die Förderung zur Wahrheit angebahnt ist.: [5090]1
     * Der romanische Reformator zählte seine Anhänger in der romanischen,
       germanischen und slavischen Welt und zeigte sich überall, wo nicht
       das Lutherthum in dem deutschen Character eine Stütze fand, diesem
       überlegen.: [5091]1
     * Die Augustana ist in ihren Antithesen, sowohl nach der römischen
       wie nach der reformirten Seite hin, das mildeste, friedliebendste,
       gegnerischer seits am leichtesten zu ertragende aller
       evangelisch-lutherischen Symbole.: [5092]1
     * Die Brüdergemeinde stellt nie ein äusserlich formulirtes
       Bekenntniss nach aussen hin auf, das sie von anderen evangelischen
       Glaubensgenossen trennen könnte. Sie wird es und kann es nie thun,
       denn nicht Abschluss und Scheidung, sondern Union ist ihr Princip.
       Aber nur jene wahre und positive Union auf Grund der heiligen
       Schrift und der lebendigen Herzens-Erfahrung, die allein die Herzen
       vereinigt.: [5093]1
     * Die Entstehung and Fortbildung des Lutherthums,: [5094]1
     * Die Entstehung und Fortbildung des Lutherthums und die kirchlichen
       Bekenntniss-Schriften desselben von: [5095]1
     * Die Frömmigkeit ist in Herrnhut eine Manier geworden, aber viele
       stille oder gebrochene Herzen hatten hier eine Heimath, und der
       alte Christus in den Zeiten des Unglaubens ein Heiligthum.: [5096]1
     * Die Gerechtigkeit, die für Gott gilt, wider die neue alcumistische
       Theologia Osianders,: [5097]1

     * Die Macht der Röm. Päpste über Fürsten, Länder, Völker, Individuen:
       [5100]1
     * Die Rechte Gottes: [5101]1
     * Die Reformation war selbst Antinomismus, insofern sie mit dem
       werkheiligen auch das gesetzliche Princip, wenn es die Seligkeit
       des Menschen bewirken will, verwarf. Melanchthon hatte Gesetz und
       Evangelium wie Schreck- und Trostmittel einander entgegengestellt
       und nur auf das letzere die Rechtfertigung gebaut, während er doch
       unter dem Gesetz den bleibenden Inhalt des göttlichen Willens
       zusammenfasst.: [5102]1
     * Die Reformirten, gegen die er den Vers wandte: "Erhalt uns Herr bei
       deinem wort und steur' der: [5103]1
     * Die Unfehlbarkeit des Papstes und das Allgemeine Concil,: [5104]1
     * Die Vermittlungsversuche des I. Andreæ und Chemnitz erreichten in
       Betreff des eigentlichen Gegensatzes zwischen den Schwaben und
       Niederdeutschen keine innere Einigung, sondern nur eine Vereinigung
       van disharmonischen Sätzen von beiden Seiten her in einem Buch. Die
       Folge war daher nicht Eintracht, sondern vielseitige Zwietracht.:

       Kirche erhielt am: [5108]1
     * Diese Confession, zu der Bullinger zweimal Angesichts des Todes
       sich bekannte, erscheint als das reife Ergebniss seines
       Glaubenslebens, seiner reichen inneren und äusseren Erfahrung, als
       der Inbegriff seiner theologischen Ueberzeugung wie seiner
       kirchlichen Grundsätze, als die ächte, wahrhafte Entwicklung und
       Fortbildung seiner früheren Bekenntnisse, zumal der ersten
       helvetischen Confession: [5109]1
     * Diesen Katechismum oder christliche Lehre in solche kleine,
       schlechte, einfältige Form zu stellen, hat mich gezwungen und
       gedrungen die klägliche elende Noth, so ich neulich erfahren habe,
       da ich auch ein Visitator war. Hilf, lieber Gott, wie manchen
       Jammer habe ich gesehen, dass der gemeine Mann doch so gar nichts
       weiss von der christlichen Lehre, sonderlich auf den Dörfern! Und
       leider viel Pfarrherren ganz ungeschickt und untüchtig sind zu
       lehren; und sollen doch alle Christen heissen, getauft sein und der
       heiligen Sacramente geniessen; können weder Vaterunser, noch den
       Glauben, oder Zehn Gebote; leben dahin, wie das liebe Vieh und
       unvernünftige Säue; und nun das Evangelium kommen ist, dennoch fein
       gelernt haben, aller Freiheit meisterlich zu missbrauchen. O ihr
       Bischöfe, was wollt ihr doch Christo immer mehr antworten, dass ihr
       das Volk so schändlich habt lassen hingehen, und euer Amt nicht
       einen Augenblick je bewiesen? Dass euch alles Unglück fliehe!
       Verbietet einerlei Gestalt und treibet auf eure Menchengesetze,
       fraget aber derweil nichts danach, ob sie das Vaterunser, Glauben,
       Zehn Gebote oder einiges Gotteswort können. Ach und wehe über euren
       Hals ewiglich! Darum bitte ich um Gottes willen euch alle meine
       lieben Herren und Brüder, so Pfarrherren oder Prediger sind, wollet
       euch eures Amtes von Herzen annehmen, euch erbarmen über euer Volk,
       das euch befohlen ist, und uns helfen den Katechismus in die Leute,
       sonderlich in das junge Volk bringen; und welche es nicht besser
       vermögen, diese Tafeln und Formen vor sich nehmen, und dem Volke
       von Wort zu Wort fürbilden: [5110]1
     * Dort: [5111]1
     * Du sollst den Feiertag heiligen: [5112]1
     * Durch diese Artikel wollen wir keineswegs allen Kirchen eine
       einzige Glaubensregel vorschreiben. Denn wir erkennen keine andere
       Glaubensregel an als die heilige Schrift. Wer also mit dieser
       übereinstimmt, mit dem sind wir einstimmig, obgleich er anders von
       unserer Confession verschiedene Redensarten brauchte. Denn auf die
       Sache selbst und die Wahrheit, nicht auf die Worte soll man sehen.
       Wir stellen also jedem frei, diejeniqen Redensarten zu gebrauchen,
       welche er für seine Kirche am passendsten glaubt, und werden uns
       auch dergleichen Freiheit bedienen, gegen Verdrehung des wahren
       Sinnes dieser Confession uns aber zu vertheidigen wissen. Dieser
       Ansdrücke haben wir uns jetzt bedient, um unsere Ueberzeugung
       darzustellen.: [5113]1
     * Ebenso bestimmt, wie seine wahre Menschheit, tritt im Neuen
       Testament auch die wahre : [5114]1
     * Ein gut Unterricht und getreuer Rathschlag aus heil. göttlicher
       Schrift,: [5115]1
     * Eine Person ist, so giebt die Schrift um solcher persönlichen
       Einigkeit willen auch alles, was der Menschheit widerfährt, der
       Gottheit, und wiederum. Und ist auch also in der Wahrheit. Denn da
       musst du ja sagen: Die Person leidet, stirbt; nun ist die Person
       wahrhaftiger Gott: durum ist's recht geredet: Gottes Sohn leidet.:
       [5116]1
     * Entäusserung also gleich Menschwerdung ist. Darnach fordert dieses
       Lehrstück eine andere Fassung, als die alte : [5117]1
     * Entschuldigung: [5118]1
     * Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort: [5119]1
     * Es ist also gefasset, dass ich nicht weiss, ob seit der Apostel
       Zeit in der Kirche des Neuen Testamentes etwas Wichtigeres and
       Herrlicheres geschrieben sei: [5120]1
     * Es ist fast lächerlich,: [5121]1
     * Es ist gewisslich wahr, dass die Tugenden Glaube, Liebe, Hoffnung,
       und andere in uns sein müssen und zur Seligkeit nöthig seien.:
       [5122]1
     * Es ist unbestreitbar, dass die reformirte christologische
       Literatur, die um die Zeit der Concordienformel ihren Blüthepunkt
       erreicht, durch Geist, Scharfsinn, Gelehrsamkeit und philosophische
       Bildung der lutherischen Theologie vollkommen ebenbürtig, ja in
       manchen Beziehungen überlegen ist.: [5123]1
     * Es kann von niemandem in Abrede gestellt werden, dass die Pfälzer
       als Sieger aus diesem Streite hervorgegangen: [5124]1
     * Es luge ein jeglicher Fuchs seines Balges.: [5125]1
     * Es zeigt das Schwanken des Gemüths und den Zweifel an die
       Berechtigung der gethanen Schritte, dass die Brüder in ihren
       Schriften gleich nach der Wahl jede Differenz zwischen
       priesterlicher and bischöflicher Würde verwarfen, mil ängstlicher
       Gewissenhaftigkeit aber bei sich die letztere einführten.: [5126]1
     * Friss Vogel oder stirb: [5127]1
     * Genf war im Herbst: [5128]1
     * Gerade die Lehre von der Erwählung, der man so oft vorgeworfen hat,
       dass sie die sittliche Kraft lähme, dass sie zu Trägheit and
       Sorglosigheit hinführe, gerade diese Lehre ist es, aus welcher der
       Reformirte jene rücksichts- und zweifellose, bis zur Härte und
       Leidenschaftlichkeit durchgreifende praktische Energie schöpft, wie
       wir sie an den Helden dieses Glaubens, einem Zwingli, einem Calvin,
       einem Farel, einem Knox, einem Cromwell, bewundern, welche ihn vor
       den Zweifeln und Anfechtungen bewahrt, die dem weicheren, tiefer
       mit sich selbst beschäftigten Gemüth so viel zu schaffen machen,
       von denen selbst der grosse deutsche Glaubensheld Luther noch in
       späten Jahren heimgesucht wurde. Die wesentliche religiöse
       Bedeutung dieser Lehre, ihre Bedeutung für das innere Leben der
       Gläubigen, liegt nicht in der Ueberzeuzung von der Unbedingtheit
       des göttlichen Wirkens als solchen, sondern in dem Glauben an seine
       Unbedingtheit : [5129]1

       Bekenntnisses sichtbare Verwandtschaft geltend zu machen, war die
       Confession gedacht und abgefasst.: [5147]1
     * In halb Deutschland herumzureisen, und an jedem neuen Ort mit neuen
       Menschen zu unterhandlen--hier mit dem Ministerio einer
       Reichsstadt, und dort mit einer kleinen Synode von
       Superintendenten, welche die Geistlichkeit einer ganzen Grafschaft
       oder eines Fürstenthums repräsentiren--heute mit Flacianern und
       morgen mit Anhängern der Wittenbergischen Schule und Verehrern
       Melanchthons--jetzt mit den Hauptpersonen, die an dem gelehrten
       Streit den vorzüglichsten Antheil genommen, und jetzt mit den
       Schreiern, die bloss den Lärm vermehrt, und dazwischen hinein mit
       einem oder dem andern Stillen im Lande, die bisher im Verborgenen
       über den Streit geseufzt hatten--und allen diesen Menschen alles zu
       werden, um sie zu gewinnen--es gab wirklich kein Geschäft in der
       Welt, das für ihn so gemacht war, wie dieses, so wie es auch
       umgekehrt wenige Menschen gab, die für das Geschäft so gemacht
       waren, wie er. Nimmt man aber noch dies dazu, dass sich auch der
       gute, Andreæ selbst dazu für gemacht hielt, dass in die natürliche
       Thätigkeit seines Geistes auch zuweilen ein kleiner Windzug von
       Ehrgeiz und Eitelkeit hineinblies, dass er auch für den Reiz der
       bedeutenden Rolle, die er dabei spielen, und des Aufsehens, das er
       erregen würde, nicht unfühlbar war, ja dass selbst der Gedanke an

     * Kann Christus' Leib über Tisch sitzen and dennoch im Brot sein, so

       schlechter Christus bleiben, der nicht mehr, denn an einem
       einzelnen Orte zugleich eine göttliche and menschliche Person wäre,
       und an allen anderen Orten müsste er allein ein blosser
       abgesonderter Gott und göttliche Person sein ohne Menschseit. Nein,
       Geselle, wo du mir Gott hinsetzest, da must du mir die Menschheit
       mit hinsetzen. Die lassen sich nicht sondern und von einander

       Form. . . . Mel. war der Mann, welcher mit Objektivität, Feinheit,
       Klarheit, Milde zu schreiben verstand. Und wie nie hat er diese
       Gabe in diesem Falle verwerthet.: [5159]1
     * Müssen wir auch glauben, dass der Papst unfehlbar ist?: [5160]1
     * M. Flac. Illyricus war ein fanatischer Verehrer Luther's, der von
       allen Parteigenossen durch Kraft, Consequenz, Klarheit und
       Sicherheit seiner theologischen Speculation und durch Energie des
       Willens wie des Denkens hervorragend, kein Opfer und kein
       Mittel--auch nicht den schändlichsten Verrath am Vertrauen
       Melanchthon's--scheute, um sein klar erkanntes Ziel, nämlich die,
       Vernichtung Melanchthon's and der bisherigen Tradition des
       Protestantisimus zu erreichen und dem Bekenntniss der Kirche einen
       ganz anderen Charakter aufzuprägen als der war, in dem es sich
       bisher entwickelt hatte.: [5161]1
     * Man hat daraus eine Gleichgültigkeit gegen den historischen
       Christus und sein Werk erschliessen wollen, dass er : [5162]1
     * Melanchthon hat Luther's christologische Ansichten aus der Zeit des
       Abendmahlsstreites nie getheilt. Die Menschwerdung besteht ihm in
       der Aufnahme der menschlichen Natur in die: [5163]1
     * Melanchthon kam, ohne auf Calvin Rücksicht zu nehmen, ja ohne von
       dessen Lehre wissen zu können, auf selbständigem Wege zu derselben
       Ansicht, welche bei Calvin sich ausgebildet hatte: [5164]1
     * Mit Spener beginnt jener grosse Eroberungszug der reformirten
       Kirche gegen die lutherische, der seitdem verschiedene Namen, erst
       Frömmigkeit, dann Toleranz, dann Union, dann Conföderation auf sein
       Panier geschrieben hat.: [5165]1
     * Mitteldinge: [5166]1
     * Nach der Methodistischen Auffassung des Heilsverhältnisses Gottes
       und des Menschen hängt das Heil oder Nicht-Heil eines jeden
       Menschen lediglich von seinem eigenen freien Verhalten gegenüber
       den erleuchtenden, erneuernden und heiligenden Einwirkungen des
       heiligen Geistes ab. Verhält man sich gegenüber diesen Einwirkungen
       empfänglich, so wird man hier, und einst dort, selig werden;
       verschliesst man sein Herz gegen dieselben, so wird man hier, und
       auf ewig im Tode verbleiben. Mit dieser Grundanschauung hängen alle
       sonstigen Eigenthümlichkeiten des Methodismus, wie z. B. seine
       eigenthümliche Freiheitslehre, seine Betonung der Wirksamkeit des
       heiligen Geistes, seine Lehre von der christlichen Vollkommenheit,
       und dergleichen, eng zusammen. Seinem innersten Geist und Wesen

       wonach die Sehnsucht nur mit meinem Leben absterben wird. Nicht nur
       findet sich hier das vollkommene Institut einer vollkommenen
       Republik, sondern als eine besondere Zierde und Mittel der
       Disciplin eine Sittenzucht, nach welcher über die Sitten und selbst
       die geringsten Ueberschreitungen der Bürger wöchentlich
       Untersuchung angestellt wird, zuerst durch die Viertelsinspectoren,
       dann durch die Senioren, endlich durch den Magistrat, je nachdem
       der Frevel der Sache oder die Verhärtung und Verstockung der
       Schuldigen es erfordern. In Folge dessen sind denn alle Fluchworte,
       alles Würfel- und Kartenspiel, Ueppigkeit, Uebermuth, Zank, Hass,
       Betrug, Luxus, u.s.w., geschweige denn grössere Vergehungen, die
       fast unerhört sind, untersagt. Welche herrliche Zierde für die
       christliche Religion solche Sittenreinheit, vor der wir mil allen
       Thränen beweinen müssen, dass sie uns fehlt und fast ganz
       venachlässigt wird, und alle Gutgesinnten sich anstrengen, dass sie
       in's Leben gerufen werde! Mich, wofern mich die Verschiedenheit der
       Religion nicht abgehalten, hätte die sittliche Uebereinstimmung
       hier auf ewig gefesselt, und mit allem Eifer habe ich von da an
       getrachtet, dass etwas Aehnliches auch unserer Kirche zu Theil
       würde. Nicht geringer als die öffentliche Zucht war auch die
       häusliche meines Hausherrn Scarron ausgezeichnet durch stetige
       Gebetsübungen, Lectüre der heiligen Schrift, Gottesfurcht in Worten
       und Thaten, Masshalten in Speise und Kleidung, dass ich eine

     * C'est probablement d'après la copie de Junius que cette Confession

       Crespin ne diffère pas de celui du manuscrit authentique.: [5263]1
     * Calvin ne la sauve pas seulement, mais conquiert à cette petite
       ville une grandeur, une puissance morale immense. Il en fait la
       capitale de la Réforme, autant que la Réforme peut avoir une
       capitale, pour la moitié du monde protestante, avec une vaste
       influence, acceptée ou subie, sur l'autre moitié. Genève n'est rien
       par la population, par les armes, par le territoire: elle est tout
       par l'esprit. Un seul avantage matériel lui garantit tous ses
       avantages moraux: son admirable position, qui fait d'elle une
       petite France républicaine et protestante, indépendante de la
       monarchie catholique de France et à l'abri de l'absorption
       monarchique et catholique; la Suisse protestante, alliée necessaire
       de la royauté française contre l'empereur, couvre Genève par la
       politique vis-à-vis du roi et par l'épée contre la maison
       d'Autriche et de Savoie.: [5264]1

     * Du Concile général et de la paix religieuse,: [5271]1
     * Fidèlement attaché à la tradition de l'Église catholique, nous
       tenons, non-seulement qu'il est l'oeuvre des apôtres, mais encore
       qu'il fut composé par eux, alors que réunis à Jérusalem, ils
       allaient se disperser dans l'univers entier; et qu'ils volurent,
       avant de séparer, fixer une règle de foi vraiment uniforme et
       catholique, destinée à être livrée, partout la même, aux
       catéchumènes.: [5272]1
     * Fils respectueux et reconnaissants de Calvin, notre grand
       Réformateur, mais condamnant une erreur qui fut celle de son siècle
       et fermement attachés à la liberté de conscience selon les vrais
       principes de la Réformation et de l'Evangile nous avons élevé ce
       monument expiatoire, le 27 Octobre, 1903.: [5273]1
     * Il a mis le glaive en la main des magistrats pour réprimer les
       pechés commis non seulement contre la seconde table des
       commandements de Dieu, mais aussi contre la première.: [5274]1
     * L'infaillibilité et le Concile général,: [5275]1
     * L'un et l'autre expriment cette haute puissance qui les domine
       toutes, dont toutes les autres dérivent, qui gouverne et n'est pas
       gouvernée, qui juge et n'est pas jugée. Quand nous disons que
       l'Eglise est infaillible, nous ne demandons pour elle, il est bien
       essentiel de l'observer, aucun privilége particulier; nous
       demandons seulement qu'elle jouisse du droit commun à toutes les
       souverainetés possible qui toutes agissent néssairement comme
       infaillibles; car tout gouvernement est absolu; et du moment où
       l'on peut lui résister sous prétexte d'erreur ou d'injustice, il
       n'existe plus.' Du Pape,: [5276]1

     * Lettre sur le futur Concile OEcuménique,: [5283]1
     * Mon père m'avoit destiné à la Théologie; mais puis après, d'autant
       qu'il considéroit que la science des Loix communément enrichit ceux
       qui la suyvent, ceste espérance luy fait incontinent changer
       d'avis.: [5284]1
     * Nos sympathies personnelles sont avec la droite dans les trois
       grandes questions que le Synode a eu à résoudre: celle de
       l'autorité du Synode, celle de la déclaration de foi, celle enfin
       des conditions de foi et de doctrine auxquelles les pasteurs et les
       électeurs devront désormais souscrire. Nous estimons que par ces
       trois votes la majorité a accompli des actes nécessaires, et que
       si, par un abus de pouvoir que nous ne voulons pas prévoir, le
       gouvernement refusait de ratifier son oeuvre: [5285]1
     * Notre saint éternel depend de cette condition, que nous appellons
       la foy; cette foy depend de la grace de Dieu et de la puissance de
       son Esprit; cette grace, cette puissance de l'Esprit depend du
       conseil de l'election de Dieu, et ce conseil n'ayant autre
       fondement que sa volonté est constant et irrevocable, l'événement
       sursuit necessairement. Ce conseil depend de la libre volonté de
       Dieu.: [5286]1

       IX. a convoqué pour le 8 décembre prochain,: [5292]1

       le schéma; je ne sais pas ce qu'il contient.: [5293]1
     * Troisième: [5294]1
     * avec ce mysticisme enthousiaste, ce dédain pour les remontrances
       des savants et des sages, cette confiance impassible. Quel que soit
       le jugement de l'histoire, personne ne pourra nier que cette foi
       profonde ne lui ait créé dans le dix-neuvième siècle une
       personnalité d'une puissance et d'une majesté incomparables, dont
       l'éclat grandit encore un pontificat déjà si remarquable par une
       durée, des vertus et des malheurs vraiment exceptionnels.: [5295]1

       regarde l'exercise du pouvoir civil en matière de foi.: [5303]1
