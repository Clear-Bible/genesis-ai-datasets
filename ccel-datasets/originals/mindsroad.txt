THE MIND'S ROAD TO GOD

   by

Saint Bonaventura: 1221-1274

PREFACE

   This translation of St. Bonaventura's "Itinerarium Mentis ad Deum" is
   addressed to undergraduate students of the history of philosophy who
   may wish to read a work of a great medieval Franciscan thinker. I have
   used the Latin text of the Franciscan Fathers contained in "Tria
   Opuscula" (Quaracchi), fifth edition, 1938. Biblical quotations are
   taken from the Douay Bible, since that is a translation of the Vulgate,
   which, it goes without saying, St. Bonaventura used. In order to make
   the translation more readable, I have taken the liberty of breaking up
   a few of the longer sentences and once in a while have inserted
   explanatory words and phrases in square brackets. In two places,
   indicated in footnotes, I have made slight emendations to the text.
   Students who approach this work for the first time would do well to
   familiarize themselves with Giotto's painting of St. Francis receiving
   the stigmata, for the "Itinerarium" could almost be called a meditation
   upon the vision there depicted.

   My deepest thanks are given to the Reverend George Glanzman, S. J., who
   made a painstaking comparison of this translation with the Latin
   original and suggested several revisions which improved my first draft.
   I have accepted all of his suggestions gratefully but, of course, I
   alone am responsible for the version as it now appears. Any errors in
   the translation, footnotes, and introduction must be laid at my door.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON ST. BONAVENTURA

   St. Bonaventura, a native of Tuscany, was born Giovanni di Fidanza in
   1221. He entered the Franciscan order about 1242 and in the short space
   of fifteen years rose to be seventh general of that order. Professor of
   theology at the University of Paris, Bishop of Albano, and created a
   cardinal by Gregory X shortly before his death in 1274, he was widely
   venerated during his lifetime and is mentioned as a saint in Dante's
   Paradiso. He was canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV and a little over a
   century later declared a doctor of the church by Sixtus V. He has
   usually been known as the Seraphic Donor, probably because of his
   mysticism and constant preoccupation with the vision of the Seraph
   which is described in the Prologue to "The Mind's Road to God." In
   addition to this little treatise, his major works are the "Reductio
   Artium in Theologiam" ("Reduction of the Arts to Theology"), the
   "Biblia Pauperum" ("Bible of the Poor"), and the "Breviloquium."

INTRODUCTION

   There should be little need of apologizing for a new translation into
   English of Saint Bonaventura's "Itinerarium Mentis ad Deum," for it has
   been recognized by all serious historians of philosophy as one of the
   shorter masterpieces of medieval philosophy. It sets forth in very few
   pages a whole system of metaphysics; it illustrates a philosophical
   method; it typifies the thinking of one of the great monastic orders of
   the West; it stands at the beginning of Renaissance science as one of
   those documents in which the future can be seen in germ. Besides its
   importance as an outstanding work in metaphysics, a work comparable to
   Descartes' "Discourse on Method," Leibniz's Monadology, or Hume's
   "Enquiry" in its compactness and suggestiveness, it represents a strain
   of medieval thought which has been too much neglected since the
   publication of "Aeterni Patris," in 1879. That encyclical with its
   emphasis upon Thomism has given many people, both Catholic and
   non-Catholic, the impression that the philosophy of Saint Thomas
   Aquinas is the "official" philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church. The
   result of this miscomprehension has been disparagement of writings
   other than Thomistic. Yet even in the thirteenth century Catholic
   philosophers were far from being in agreement, either on matters of
   doctrine or method. One has only to mention such figures as Alexander
   of Hales, the master of Saint Bonaventura; Roger Bacon; and the various
   monks of Saint Victor, to realize that the confusion and disagreement
   which certain writers of today find in our own time were just as
   characteristic of a period to which they refer as one of universal
   concord.

   The metaphysical point of view of Saint Bonaventura can be traced back
   to Plotinus, if not to Philo. Fundamental to his whole system is that
   fusion of the three hierarchies of Neo-Platonism: the hierarchy of
   logical classes, that of values, and that of reality. Elementary
   students of logic are accustomed to the doctrine that individuals can
   be grouped into classes which belong to certain species; that these
   species are again susceptible to classification in certain genera; that
   these are capable of being grouped into still larger orders and
   families, until we come to the class which includes all other classes
   and which is usually called being. This hierarchy of classes in the
   textbooks of classical logic is called the Tree of Porphyry. In
   non-philosophic work we find the same sort of thing illustrated in the
   Linnaean classification of plants and animals. The higher up one goes
   in this hierarchy, the more inclusive are one's classes. Thus the class
   of vertebrates is more inclusive than the class of mammals, and the
   class of animals is more inclusive than the class of vertebrates.

   If we assume, as most classical writers did, that such a classification
   reproduces the structure of reality, that classes are ordained by God
   and are not simply convenient groupings made by man for his own
   purposes, then we can see in this order of beings a scale of creatures
   which might be thought of as a map of all things, a tree not only of
   life but of all existence. But an added assumption is usually
   introduced into the discussion at this point, the assumption of both
   Plotinus and Saint Bonaventura, that the more general a class, the more
   real and the better. This assumption may be argued, but one can at
   least imagine why someone contemplating this arrangement of classes
   within other classes, running from the least inclusive to the most
   inclusive, would maintain that there was logical priority in the more
   general. For before one can define, let us say, man as a rational
   animal, it would be necessary to know the definition of "animal"; and
   before one could define "animality," one would have to know the
   definition of "living matter." This logical order of priority and
   posteriority might be thought of as corresponding in some mysterious
   way-- and it has remained mysterious to this day--to some relationship
   in the order of reality. The problem was to discover precisely what
   this relationship was.

   Plotinus answered the question by the invention of a basic metaphor.
   The universe was subject to something which he called "emanation." The
   lower classes flowed out of the upper classes as light flowed from a
   candle. Such metaphors have been of the greatest influence in the
   history of thought, both philosophic and scientific. Thus we have had
   such figurative terms as "affinity" in chemistry, or the "life force"
   in biology, or the "life cycle of a nation" in history, terms which
   were taken literally by some people but which upon scrutiny turned out
   to be figures of speech. In Plotinus' case there is little doubt that
   he believed emanation to be literal truth; though when he came to
   explain how lower orders emanated from higher, he could do it only by
   means of a more elaborate figure of speech or by having recourse to
   what he thought of as a law of nature, namely, that all things produced
   something and that what they produced was always "lower" than they
   themselves. Thus, Being produced the kinds of Being, and each kind
   produced less inclusive kinds; and so on down to the smallest classes
   in which individual things were comprised.

   This hierarchy of Being appears throughout the work of Saint
   Bonaventura, though he did not derive it immediately from Plotinus. It
   had become a medieval commonplace which few were willing to question.
   And yet he could not accept the whole theory of emanation, since he was
   bound by his religious faith to believe in actual creation out of
   nothing. The God of Plotinus was The One from whom everything flowed
   like light; the God of Saint Bonaventura was the personal God of
   Genesis. His metaphysical problem was to accommodate one to the other.
   This accommodation appears most clearly in the fifth chapter of the
   "Itinerarium."

   The second hierarchy which was fused with the logical hierarchy was
   that of value. There is no purely logical reason why the general should
   be any better than the particular, though there are good traditional
   grounds for thinking so. Plato, Aristotle, the Neo-Platonists, and even
   the Stoics had a tendency to confuse goodness with the ideal or the
   general. In ancient Pagan thought, there was a standard belief that no
   particular was ever a perfect exemplification of its class--no triangle
   made of matter being a perfect geometrical triangle, no human being a
   perfectly rational animal, no work of art a perfect realization of the
   artist's idea. Arguing in this way, one could see that no species would
   ever perfectly exemplify its genus, no genus its higher order, and so
   on. Hence the process "downward" from Being was degeneration. When one
   stops to think that the Christian religion insisted upon man's nature
   as having been vitiated by sin--sin which, though committed by our
   primordial parents, was nevertheless inherited by us--one can also see
   why, to a Christian, the fusion of the logical and the value-hierarchy
   was natural enough. We still look in vain for the perfect
   exemplification of animal and vegetable species, though we are inclined
   to believe that the species is an ideal formed for intellectual
   purposes, and not to be expected to exist in anything other than
   scientific books and articles. But to a Christian thinker of the type
   of Saint Bonaventura, the species and genera were the ideas of God in
   accordance with which He had created the world. It is they which are
   responsible for the orderliness of the universe; they are sometimes
   called by the Stoic term, seminal reasons. In the nineteenth century,
   when men were as impressed by the regularity of scientific laws as they
   had been in the thirteenth, people like Lord Russell found a religious
   satisfaction in contemplating them, the only difference being that Lord
   Russell did not use the Stoic term; nor did he think of scientific laws
   as the ideas in the mind of God. If permanence and invariability are
   marks of goodness, then indeed the more general the law, or the more
   inclusive the idea, the better. And since the most general and
   inclusive term is without question the term "Being," it would follow
   that "Being" was the best of all things. In the sixth chapter of the
   "Itinerarium," in which Saint Bonaventura discusses "Good" as the name
   of God, the importance of this fusion appears most clearly.

   The third hierarchy, as we have said, was that of reality. In common
   speech we are accustomed to think of particular things in this material
   world of time and space as more real than ideas, or logical classes, or
   mathematical concepts, such as circles and triangles. We should, if
   untutored in the history of philosophy, think that a given man, George
   Washington or Abraham Lincoln, was more real than the idea of mankind
   though it is doubtful whether we should proceed to maintain that the
   idea of "rational animal" is more real than that of "animal." The
   fundamental question for a philosopher is what we mean by the adjective
   "real" and whether we should give it a meaning such that it may be used
   in the comparative and superlative degrees. Saint Bonaventura was far
   from being unique in thinking that this adjective was comparable;
   indeed such modern thinkers as Hegel and his followers seemed to have
   taken that for granted. In any event Saint Bonaventura did believe in
   its comparability, and he identified the hierarchy of reality with
   those of logic and value.

   This fusion of hierarchies lies behind the whole method of thinking
   which is illustrated by the "Itinerarium," and it must be accepted by a
   reader who wishes to study the work sympathetically. But along with
   this metaphysical matrix a certain philosophical method is to be found
   which is of particular importance in studying this work. That method is
   resident in a theory of knowledge which makes true knowledge a matter
   of inspection, of seeing. We all have to believe that certain ideas
   must be taken for granted, whether they are the postulates of a system
   of geometry which we accept merely for the purpose of deducing their
   consequences or whether they are the simple matters of perceptual fact
   which we are likely to call the truths of observation. Again, when we
   deduce a conclusion from a set of premises, as in a simple syllogism or
   a bit of arithmetical reasoning, how do we know that the conclusion is
   not merely logically entailed in the premises, but true also to fact?
   Cardinal Newman, in his "Grammar of Assent," distinguished between what
   he called "real assent" and "notional assent"--the former being the
   assent which we give to propositions of existence or, roughly, fact;
   the latter, that which we give to the logical conclusions. Thus the
   following syllogism is logically accurate, but no one would believe in
   the truth of its conclusion:

   1. All triangles are plane figures. 2. John Doe is a triangle. 3. John
   Doe is a plane figure.

   We should be obligated to maintain that the conclusion followed from
   the premises, but we would not give real assent to it nevertheless.
   Just what do we mean by real assent, and how does it arise?

   The most obvious case of real assent occurs in the acceptance of the
   truths of observation. If someone is asked why he thinks sugar is
   sweet, he will tell you that it is because he has tasted it. If someone
   asks why a person believes that the sky is blue, he will be told that
   the person has looked and seen. Sensory observation looks like simple
   and direct and incontrovertible knowledge. It is not quite so simple
   and direct and incontrovertible as used to be thought, but we are
   dealing with the common- sense point of view here, and from that it has
   all these traits. Throughout the "Itinerarium" Saint Bonaventura
   emphasizes that knowledge in the last analysis comes down to seeing, to
   contemplation, to a kind of experience in which we know certain things
   to be true without further argument or demonstration. On the lowest
   level, this occurs in sensory observation, on the highest in the mystic
   vision.

   Along with this insistence on direct experience as the source of all
   truth runs a practice which goes back at least to Philo-Judaeus in the
   Hebraic- Christian tradition: the practice of the allegorical method.
   In Philo, who was mainly interested in the Pentateuch, the allegorical
   method was employed in interpreting Scripture. It was believed by him
   that if every verse in the Bible was accepted literally, then we should
   have to believe things which were contrary to reason. Thus we should
   have to believe that God, Who is not in space, actually walked in the
   Garden of Eden; that He spoke as human beings speak with a physical
   voice; that He literally breathed into Adam the breath of life as we
   breathe our breath into things. [1] But to hold such beliefs is to deny
   the spirituality and ubiquity of God, and that is repugnant to our
   religious and philosophical theories. Consequently Philo maintained
   that these and similar texts must be interpreted allegorically, and he
   naturally believed that he had the key to the allegory. Similarly the
   "Itinerarium," which begins as a meditation upon the vision which Saint
   Francis had on Mount Alverna, continues as an interpretation in
   philosophical terms, not only of the vision itself, but also of certain
   passages in Exodus and Isaiah in which details of the vision are
   paralleled. The Seraph which Saint Francis saw, and which had three
   pairs of wings, has to be interpreted as a symbol of a philosophical
   and religious idea. The wings become stages in the process of the
   mind's elevation to God, and their position on the body of the Seraph
   indicates the heights of the stages. Furthermore, it will be seen that
   even the physical world itself becomes a sort of symbol of religious
   ideas. This was in keeping with many traditions which were common in
   the Middle Ages--ideas that appeared in the Bestiaries and Lapidaries,
   and which we retain in weakened form in some of our pseudoheraldic
   symbols, such as the Eagle, the Lion, and the Olive Branch; or the use
   of certain colors, such as blue for hope, white for purity, red for
   passion. Among these more popular symbols was that of the macrocosm and
   the microcosm, according to which a human being exactly mirrored the
   universe as a whole, so that one could pass from one to the other and
   find corresponding parts and functions. Much of this was undoubtedly
   fortified by Saint Francis' fashion of humanizing natural objects--the
   sun, the birds, the rain, and so on--in his talks and poems. Few, if
   any, of the saints seem to have felt such an intimate relationship with
   the physical world as the founder of the Order to which Saint
   Bonaventura belonged.

   The full effect of this appears in the first chapter of the
   "Itinerarium," in which we are told that God may be seen in His traces
   in the physical world. This is the basis of what sometimes is called
   natural theology; for if we can actually see the traces of God about us
   in the order of natural law, then we have a start toward knowledge of
   the divine mind which is sure. It is only a start, Saint Bonaventura
   maintains, but it is the proper start. It means that one does not have
   to be a great rationalist, an erudite theologian, a doctor, to know
   religious truths. One has only to look about one and observe that
   certain laws obtain; that there is order; that all things are "disposed
   in weight, number, and measure." This can be seen; and when it is seen,
   one has a reflection of the divine mind in one's sensory experience.
   One has only to contrast this with the method of Saint Thomas Aquinas
   in the "Summa Theologica," in which God's existence is proved by a
   series of rational arguments--where objections are analyzed,
   authorities are consulted and weighed, multiple distinctions are made,
   and the whole emphasis is upon reason rather than observation. Saint
   Bonaventura seems to have as his purpose a demonstration of God's
   existence and of His traits which is not irrational but nonrational.
   That is, he would be far from saying that his conclusions would not
   stand up under rational criticism, but would insist that his method, to
   use modern language, is empirical rather than rational. To take a
   trivial example from another field, we could prove that a person had
   committed a crime either by circumstantial evidence or by direct
   testimony. If we can produce two or three persons who actually saw him
   commit the crime, we do not feel that we must corroborate what they say
   by a rational demonstration that he could have committed it, that he
   had a motive for committing it, that he threatened to commit it, that
   no one else could have committed it, and so on. We like to think that a
   good case gives us both kinds of evidence, but frequently we have to be
   satisfied with one type or bits of both types. Saint Bonaventura might
   be compared to the man who insists on direct testimony; Saint Thomas to
   him who puts his trust exclusively in circumstantial evidence, though
   the comparison would be superficial. It would be superficial since both
   would agree that God's existence could be shown in both ways.

   The method of direct observation by which one is made certain of one's
   beliefs leads step by step to the mystic vision. The mystic, like the
   strict empiricist, has a kind of knowledge which is indisputable. No
   one can deny what the mystic sees any more than one can deny what the
   sensory observer sees. The philosopher who bases all knowledge upon the
   direct observation of colors, sounds, shapes, and so on, has knowledge
   which he readily admits is uncommunicable, in spite of the fact that
   most of us use words for our elementary sensations in the same ways.
   But whether John Doe, who is looking upon a patch of red, sees
   precisely what Richard Roe sees, could be doubted and has been doubted.
   For the psychological equipment, the sensory apparatus of the two men
   may and probably does contribute something to even the most simple
   sensory experiences. If Messrs. Doe and Roe are exactly alike in all
   relevant ways, then one may reasonably conclude that their sensations
   are exactly alike. But nevertheless Roe would not be having Doe's
   sensation, for each man is the terminus of causal events which diverge
   from a given point and which cease to be identical once they have
   entered the human body Thus a bell may be ringing and therefore giving
   off air waves. When these air waves enter the body of Roe, they are no
   longer the same waves which have entered the body of Doe for Roe's
   auditory nerves, no matter how similar to Doe's, are not existentially
   identical with them. If we distinguish between existential and
   qualitative identity, and we all do, then we may say that Doe and Roe
   have qualitatively identical but existentially nonidentical sensations.
   Until Roe can hear with Doe's ears and auditory nerves and auditory
   brain centers, he will never experience Doe's auditory sensations.
   Similarly with the mystic vision. If one man has such a vision, he is
   not made uneasy the fact that another does not have it. The other man
   has only to follow the discipline which will lead him to it. Saint
   Bonaventura traces the steps on this road, one by one, until he reaches
   his goal.

   The mysticism of Saint Bonaventura was peculiar in that it was based on
   a theory of knowledge in which all degrees of knowledge were similarly
   direct, immediate, and nonrational. One sees God's traces in the
   sensory world; one sees His image in the mind; one sees His goodness in
   human goodness; one sees His powers in the operations of our own
   powers--it is always a question of direct seeing. Thus we have the
   possibility of real, rather than notional, assent in all fields of
   knowledge. We are not forced to know about things; we can know them. We
   have, to use other familiar terms, direct acquaintance with, rather
   than descriptions of, them. In other words, there is never any real
   need for rational discourse, for erudition. The simplest man of good
   will can see God as clearly as the most learned scholar. That made a
   philosophy such as this a perfect instrument for the Christian, for
   throughout the Christian tradition ran a current of
   anti-intellectualism. Christianity was held to be a religion, not
   merely a body of abstract knowledge. It was an experience as well as a
   theory. A man of faith could have as certain knowledge of God as the
   man of learning. This did not discourage the Christian from attempting
   to build up rational systems which would demonstrate to the world of
   scholars what the religious man knew by faith. Far from it. But what
   Kant was to say of the relationship between concepts and precepts, the
   Christian could have said of that between faith and reason, or religion
   and philosophy: faith without reason is blind, reason without faith
   empty.

   The difficulty with the extremists who maintained that either one or
   the other faculty was sufficient was that faith and reason were both
   supposed to assert something. Whether you believed by faith or by
   reason, you believed in ideas which presumably made sense, could be
   stated in words, could be true or false. If you believed in one of
   these truths by faith, without reason, you were in the position of a
   man who had no knowledge of what he was believing nor why, nor even
   whether there was any good reason for believing in it rather than its
   contradictory. It was all very well for a man like Tertullian to
   maintain that there was more glory in believing something
   irrational--inept--than in believing something demonstrably true. Most
   Christian philosophers were anxious to put a sound rational
   underpinning beneath their beliefs. Similarly, if you had only rational
   knowledge, you were like a blind man who might be convinced that there
   were such things as colors, analogous to sounds and odors, but who had
   no direct acquaintance with them; or again like a man who had read an
   eloquent description of a great painting, but who had never seen it.
   Though all Christians were in the position of maintaining that there
   were some beliefs, those in the mysteries, which could not be
   rationally demonstrated, nevertheless they all, including Saint
   Bonaventura, pushed their rational demonstrations as far as they were
   able. Thus Saint Bonaventura goes so far as to attempt a dialectical
   proof of the dogma of the Trinity (Ch. VI), though he realizes that
   such a proof is not sufficient for religion.

   It is worth pointing out that Franciscan philosophy as a whole tended
   to put more emphasis upon the observation of the natural world than its
   great rival, Thomism, did. Even in the "Little Flowers" of Saint
   Francis, only in a remote sense of the word a philosophical work, there
   is a fondness for what we call Nature which led him at times close to
   heresy. Later there were Franciscans like Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, and
   their great friend and protector, Robert Grosseteste, whose interest in
   what we would call science, as distinct from philosophy, was almost
   their main interest. Indeed, one might without too much exaggeration
   maintain that the impetus to the study of the natural world through
   empirical methods came from the Franciscans. This appears in the early
   chapters of the "Itinerarium," where observational science becomes not
   simply the satisfaction of idle curiosity, but the fulfillment of a
   religious obligation. But it goes without saying that a man of science
   may discover truths which contradict what he has believed on faith and
   that a man of faith may look to science, not for everything which it is
   capable of revealing, but only for those things which corroborate his
   faith. The best illustration of this conflict is found in the use made
   of arithmetic by allegorists, as early as Philo. Few mathematicians
   today would play upon the curious properties of numbers- -virgin
   numbers, perfect numbers, superabundant numbers, numbers which are the
   sums of such numbers as three and four--to prove religious truths. Few
   men of religion would, I imagine, seek validation of their religious
   beliefs in the properties of numbers, finding it extraordinary that
   there are four Gospels, four points of the compass, four winds, four
   elements (earth, water, air, and fire), four seasons, four humors, four
   temperaments. But all men will usually feel uneasy in the presence of
   contradiction and will do their best to bring all their beliefs into
   harmony with one another. The question reduces to the motivation of
   knowledge, the question of why exploration is pushed into fields which
   previously have been terrae incognitae. And when one compares science
   as it was before the fourteenth century and that which it became after
   that date, one sees that only a strong emotional propulsion would have
   produced the change of interest. That propulsion, we are suggesting,
   came from the Franciscans.

   The student who has no acquaintance with the philosophy of Saint
   Bonaventura can do no better than to begin with the "Itinerarium." It
   is short and yet complete; it is typical of his manner of thinking; and
   it presents only the difficulties which any medieval philosophical text
   presents. There is no need to hack one's way through a jungle of
   authorities, quotations, refutations, distinctions, and textual
   exegeses. It is not a commentary on another man's book; it is a
   straightforward statement of a philosophical point of view. It
   illustrates the manner in which its author's contemporaries and
   predecessors utilized Biblical texts, and it also illustrates the
   knowledge of physics and psychology which was current in the thirteenth
   century. It is thus one of those representative documents which it
   behooves all students of intellectual history to know. It should be
   read with sympathy. One should accept its author's various assumptions,
   both methodological and doctrinal, and begin from there. There would be
   no point in trying to translate it in terms of the twentieth century,
   for the attempt would fail. But similarly one would not attempt to
   translate Dante's cosmology into modern terms nor justify Chartres
   Cathedral in terms of functional architecture as that is understood by
   modern engineers. This book is a kind of prose poem, with a dramatic
   development of its own as one rises from step to step toward a mystic
   vision of God. That would seem to be the best approach which the
   beginner could make to it.

   descends as from the Father of Light, by Whom are given all the best
   and perfect gifts [James 1:17], the eternal Father do I call upon
   through His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, that by the intercession of the
   most holy Virgin Mary, mother of God Himself and of our Lord, Jesus
   Christ, and of the blessed Francis, our father and leader, He may
   enlighten the eyes of our mind to guide our feet into the way of that
   peace "which surpasses all understanding" [Eph. 1:17; Luke 1:79; Phil.
   4:7], which peace our Lord Jesus Christ has announced and given to us;
   which lesson our father Francis always taught, in all of whose
   preaching was the annunciation of peace both in the beginning and in
   the end, wishing for peace in every greeting, yearning for ecstatic
   peace in every moment of contemplation, as a citizen of that Jerusalem
   of which that man of peace said, with those that hated peace he was
   peaceable [Ps. 119:7], "Pray ye for the things that are for the peace
   of Jerusalem" [Ps. 121:6]. For he knew that the throne of Solomon was
   nowise save in peace, since it is written, "His place is in peace and
   His abode in Sion" [Ps. 75:3].

   2. Since, then, following the example of the most blessed father
   Francis, I breathlessly sought this peace, I, a sinner, who have
   succeeded to the place of that most blessed father after his death, the
   seventh Minister General of the brothers, though in all ways
   unworthy--it happened that by the divine will in the thirty-third year
   after the death of that blessed man I ascended to Mount Alverna as to a
   quiet place, with the desire of seeking spiritual peace; and staying
   there, while I meditated on the ascent of the mind to God, amongst
   other things there occurred that miracle which happened in the same
   place to the blessed Francis himself, the vision namely of the winged
   Seraph in the likeness of the Crucified. While looking upon this
   vision, I immediately saw that it signified the suspension of our
   father himself in contemplation and the way by which he came to it.

   3. For by those six wings are rightly to be understood the six stages
   of illumination by which the soul, as if by steps or progressive
   movements, was disposed to pass into peace by ecstatic elevations of
   Christian wisdom. The way, however, is only through the most burning
   love of the Crucified, Who so transformed Paul, "caught up into the
   third heaven" [II Cor., 12, 2], into Christ, that he said, "With Christ
   I am nailed to the cross, yet I live, now not I, but Christ liveth in
   me" [Gal. 2:19]; who therefore so absorbed the mind of Francis that his
   soul was manifest in his flesh and he bore the most holy stigmata of
   the Passion in his body for two years before his death. Therefore the
   symbol of the six-winged Seraph signifies the six stages of
   illumination, which begin with God's creatures and lead up to God, to
   Whom no one can enter properly save through the Crucified. For he who
   does not enter by the door but otherwise, he is a thief and a robber
   [John 10:1]. But if anyone does enter by this door, he shall go in and
   go out and shall find pastures [John, 9]. Because of this John says in
   his Apocalypse [22, 14], "Blessed are they that wash their robes in the
   blood of the Lamb, that they may have a right to the Tree of Life and
   may enter in by the gates into the City"; as if he were to say that one
   cannot enter into the heavenly Jerusalem through contemplation unless
   one enter through the blood of the Lamb as through a gate. For one is
   not disposed to contemplation which leads to mental elevation unless
   one be with Daniel a man of desires [Dan. 9:23]. But desires are
   kindled in us in two ways: by the cry of prayer, which makes one groan
   with the murmuring of one's heart, and by a flash of apprehension by
   which the mind turns most directly and intensely to the rays of light
   [Ps. 37:9].

   4. Therefore to the cry of prayer through Christ crucified, by Whose
   blood we are purged of the filth of vice, do I first invite the reader,
   lest perchance he should believe that it suffices to read without
   unction, speculate without devotion, investigate without wonder,
   examine without exultation, work without piety, know without love,
   understand without humility, be zealous without divine grace, see
   without wisdom divinely inspired. Therefore to those predisposed by
   divine grace, to the humble and the pious, to those filled with
   compunction and devotion, anointed with the oil of gladness [Ps. 44:8],
   to the lovers of divine wisdom, inflamed with desire for it, to those
   wishing to give themselves over to praising God, to wondering over Him
   and to delighting in Him, do I propose the following reflections,
   hinting that little or nothing is the outer mirror unless the mirror of
   the mind be clear and polished.

   Bestir yourself then, O man of God, you who previously resisted the
   pricks of conscience, before you raise your eyes to the rays of wisdom
   shining in that mirror, lest by chance you fall into the lower pit of
   shadows from the contemplation of those rays.

   5. I have decided to divide my treatise into seven chapters, heading
   them with titles so that their contents may be the more easily
   understood. I ask therefore that one think rather of the intention of
   the writer than of his work, of the sense of the words rather than the
   rude speech, of truth rather than beauty, of the exercise of the
   affections rather than the erudition of the intellect. That such may
   come about, the progress of these thoughts must not be perused lightly,
   but should be meditated upon in greatest deliberation.

                    THE MENDICANT'S VISION IN THE WILDERNESS

CHAPTER ONE

   OF THE STAGES IN THE ASCENT TO GOD AND OF HIS REFLECTION IN HIS TRACES
   IN THE UNIVERSE [2]

   1. Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee. In his heart he hath
   disposed to ascend by steps, in the vale of tears, in the place which
   he hath set [Ps. 83:6]. Since beatitude is nothing else than the
   fruition of the highest good, and the highest good is above us, none
   can be made blessed unless he ascend above himself, not by the ascent
   of his body but by that of his heart. But we cannot be raised above
   ourselves except by a higher power raising us up. For howsoever the
   interior steps are disposed, nothing is accomplished unless it is
   accompanied by divine aid. Divine help, however, comes to those who
   seek it from their hearts humbly and devoutly; and this means to sigh
   for it in this vale of tears, aided only by fervent prayer. Thus prayer
   is the mother and source of ascent ("sursum- actionis") in God.
   Therefore Dionysius, in his book, "Mystical Theology" [ch. 1, 13,
   wishing to instruct us in mental elevation, prefaces his work by
   prayer. Therefore let us pray and say to the Lord our God, "Conduct me,
   O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth; let my heart rejoice
   that it may fear Thy name" [Ps. 85:11].

   2. By praying thus one is enlightened about the knowledge of the stages
   in the ascension to God. For since, relative to our life on earth, the
   world is itself a ladder for ascending to God, we find here certain
   traces [of His hand], certain images, some corporeal, some spiritual,
   some temporal, some aeviternal; consequently some outside us, some
   inside. That we may arrive at an understanding of the First Principle,
   which is most spiritual and eternal and above us, we ought to proceed
   through the traces which are corporeal and temporal and outside us, and
   this is to be led into the way of God. We ought next to enter into our
   minds, which are the eternal image of God, spiritual and internal; and
   this is to walk in the truth of God. We ought finally to pass over into
   that which is eternal, most spiritual, and above us, looking to the
   First Principle; and this is to rejoice in the knowledge of God and in
   the reverence of His majesty.

   3. Now this is the three days' journey into the wilderness [Ex. 3:18];
   this is the triple illumination of one day, first as the evening,
   second as the morning, third as noon; this signifies the threefold
   existence of things, as in matter, in [creative] intelligence, and in
   eternal art, wherefore it is said, "Be it made, He made it," and "it
   was so done" [Gen. 1]; and this also means the triple substance in
   Christ, Who is our ladder, namely, the corporeal, the spiritual, and
   the divine.

   4. Following this threefold progress, our mind has three principal
   aspects. One refers to the external body, wherefore it is called
   animality or sensuality; the second looks inward and into itself,
   wherefore it is called spirit; the third looks above itself, wherefore
   it is called mind. From all of which considerations it ought to be so
   disposed for ascending as a whole into God that it may love Him with
   all its mind, with all its heart, and with all its soul [Mark 12:30].
   And in this consists both the perfect observance of the Law and
   Christian wisdom.

   5. Since, however, all of the aforesaid modes are twofold--as when we
   consider God as the alpha and omega, or in so far as we happen to see
   God in one of the aforesaid modes as "through" a mirror and "in" a
   mirror, or as one of those considerations can be mixed with the other
   conjoined to it or may be considered alone in its purity--hence it is
   necessary that these three principal stages become sixfold, so that as
   God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh, so the
   microcosm by six successive stages of illumination is led in the most
   orderly fashion to the repose of contemplation. As a symbol of this we
   have the six steps to the throne of Solomon [III Kings 10:19]; the
   Seraphim whom Isaiah saw have six wings; after six days the Lord called
   Moses out of the midst of the cloud [Ex. 21:16]; and Christ after six
   days, as is said in Matthew [Matthew 17:1], brought His disciples up
   into a mountain and was transfigured before them.

   6. Therefore, according to the six stages of ascension into God, there
   are six stages of the soul's powers by which we mount from the depths
   to the heights, from the external to the internal, from the temporal to
   the eternal--to wit, sense, imagination, reason, intellect,
   intelligence, and the apex of the mind, the illumination of conscience
   ("Synteresis"). These stages are implanted in us by nature, deformed by
   sin, reformed by grace, to be purged by justice, exercised by
   knowledge, perfected by wisdom.

   7. Now at the Creation, man was made fit for the repose of
   contemplation, and therefore God placed him in a paradise of delight
   [Gen. 2:16]. But turning himself away from the true light to mutable
   goods, he was bent over by his own sin, and the whole human race by
   original sin, which doubly infected human nature, ignorance infecting
   man's mind and concupiscence his flesh. Hence man, blinded and bent,
   sits in the shadows and does not see the light of heaven unless grace
   with justice succor him from concupiscence, and knowledge with wisdom
   against ignorance. All of which is done through Jesus Christ, Who of
   God is made unto us wisdom and justice and sanctification and
   redemption [I Cor. 1:30]. He is the virtue and wisdom of God, the Word
   incarnate, the author of grace and truth--that is, He has infused the
   grace of charity, which, since it is from a pure heart and good
   conscience and unfeigned faith, rectifies the whole soul in the
   threefold way mentioned above. He has taught the knowledge of the truth
   according to the triple mode of theology--that is, the symbolic, the
   literal, and the mystical--so that by the symbolic we may make proper
   use of sensible things, by the literal we may properly use the
   intelligible, and by the mystical we may be carried aloft to
   supermental levels.

   8. Therefore he who wishes to ascend to God must, avoiding sin, which
   deforms nature, exercise the above-mentioned natural powers for
   regenerating grace, and do this through prayer. He must strive toward
   purifying justice, and this in intercourse; toward the illumination of
   knowledge, and this in meditation; toward the perfection of wisdom, and
   this in contemplation. Now just as no one comes to wisdom save through
   grace, justice, and knowledge, so none comes to contemplation save
   through penetrating meditation, holy conversation, and devout prayer.
   Just as grace is the foundation of the will's rectitude and of the
   enlightenment of clear and penetrating reason, so, first, we must pray;
   secondly, we must live holily; thirdly, we must strive toward the
   reflection of truth and, by our striving, mount step by step until we
   come to the high mountain where we shall see the God of gods in Sion
   [Ps. 83:8]

   9. Since, then, we must mount Jacob's ladder before descending it, let
   us place the first rung of the ascension in the depths, putting the
   whole sensible world before us as a mirror, by which ladder we shall
   mount up to God, the Supreme Creator, that we may be true Hebrews
   crossing from Egypt to the land promised to our fathers; let us be
   Christians crossing with Christ from this world over to the Father
   [John 13:1]; let us also be lovers of wisdom, which calls to us and
   says, "Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my
   fruits" [Ecclesiasticus 24:26]. For by the greatness of the beauty and
   of the creature, the Creator of them may be seen [Wisdom 13:5].

   10. There shine forth, however, the Creator's supreme power and wisdom
   and benevolence in created things, as the carnal sense reports trebly
   to the inner sense. For the carnal sense serves him who either
   understands rationally or believes faithfully or contemplates
   intellectually. Contemplating, it considers the actual existence of
   things; believing, it considers the habitual course of things;
   reasoning, it considers the potential excellence of things.

   11. In the first mode, the aspect of one contemplating, considering
   things in themselves, sees in them weight, number, and measure [Wisdom
   11:21]-- weight, which directs things to a certain location; [3]
   number, by which they are distinguished from one another; and measure,
   by which they are limited. And so one sees in them mode, species, and
   order; and also substance, power, and operation. From these one can
   rise as from the traces to understanding the power, wisdom, and immense
   goodness of the Creator.

   12. In the second mode, the aspect of a believer considering this
   world, one reaches its origin, course, and terminus. For by faith we
   believe that the ages are fashioned by the Word of Life [Hebr. 11:3];
   by faith we believe that the ages of the three laws--that is, the ages
   of the law of Nature, of Scripture, and of Grace--succeed each other
   and occur in most orderly fashion; by faith we believe that the world
   will be ended at the last judgment--taking heed of the power in the
   first, of the providence in the second, of the justice of the most high
   principle in the third.

   13. In the third mode, the aspect of one inquiring rationally, one sees
   that some things merely are; others, however, are and live; others,
   finally, are, live, and discern. And the first are lesser things, the
   second midway, and the third the best. Again, one sees that some are
   only corporeal, others partly corporeal and partly spiritual, from
   which it follows that some are entirely spiritual and are better and
   more worthy than either of the others. One sees, nonetheless, that some
   are mutable and corruptible, as earthly things; others mutable and
   incorruptible, as celestial things, from which it follows that some are
   immutable and incorruptible, as the supercelestial things.

   From these visible things, therefore, one mounts to considering the
   power and wisdom and goodness of God as being, living, and
   understanding; purely spiritual and incorruptible and immutable.

   14. This consideration, however, is extended according to the sevenfold
   condition of creatures, which is a sevenfold testimony to the divine
   power, wisdom, and goodness, as one considers the origin, magnitude,
   multitude, beauty, plenitude, operation, and order of all things. For
   the "origin" of things, according to their creation, distinction, and
   beauty, in the work of the six days indicates the divine power
   producing all things from nothing, wisdom distinguishing all things
   clearly, and goodness adorning all things generously. "Magnitude" of
   things, either according to the measure of their length, width, and
   depth, or according to the excellence of power spreading itself in
   length, breadth, and depth, as appears in the diffusion of light, or
   again according to the efficacy of its inner, continuous, and diffused
   operation, as appears in the operation of fire-- magnitude, I say,
   indicates manifestly the immensity of the power, wisdom, and goodness
   of the triune God, Who exists unlimited in all things through His
   power, presence, and essence. "Multitude" of things, according to the
   diversity of genus, species, and individuality, in substance, form, or
   figure, and efficacy beyond all human estimation, clearly indicates and
   shows the immensity of the aforesaid traits in God. "Beauty" of things,
   according to the variety of light, figure, and color in bodies simple
   and mixed and even composite, as in the celestial bodies, minerals,
   stones and metals, plants and animals, obviously proclaims the three
   mentioned traits. "Plenitude" of things--according to which matter is
   full of forms because of the seminal reasons; form is full of power
   because of its activity; power is full of effects because of its
   efficiency--declares the same manifestly. "Operation," multiplex
   inasmuch as it is natural, artificial, and moral, by its very variety
   shows the immensity of that power, art, and goodness which indeed are
   in all things the cause of their being, the principle of their
   intelligibility, and the order of their living. "Order," by reason of
   duration, situation, and influence, as prior and posterior, upper and
   lower, nobler and less noble, indicates clearly in the book of creation
   the primacy, sublimity, and dignity of the First Principle in relation
   to its infinite power. The order of the divine laws, precepts, and
   judgments in the Book of Scripture indicates the immensity of His
   wisdom. The order of the divine sacraments, rewards, and punishments in
   the body of the Church indicates the immensity of His goodness. Hence
   order leads us most obviously into the first and highest, most
   powerful, wisest, and best.

   15. He, therefore, who is not illumined by such great splendor of
   created things is blind; he who is not awakened by such great clamor is
   deaf; he who does not praise God because of all these effects is dumb;
   he who does not note the First Principle from such great signs is
   foolish. Open your eyes therefore, prick up your spiritual ears, open
   your lips, and apply your heart, that you may see your God in all
   creatures, may hear Him, praise Him, love and adore Him, magnify and
   honor Him, lest the whole world rise against you. For on this account
   the whole world will fight against the unwise [Prov. 5:21]; but to the
   wise will there be matter for pride, who with the Prophet can say,
   "Thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in Thy doings: and in the works
   of Thy hands I shall rejoice [Ps. 91:5]. . . . How great are Thy works,
   O Lord; Thou hast made all things in wisdom; the earth is filled with
   Thy riches" [Ps. 103:24].
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] have translated the Latin "speculatio," which appears over and over
   again in this work, in a variety of ways. St. Bonaventura plays upon
   its various shades of meaning--reflection, speculation,
   consideration--for he seems haunted by the basic metaphor of the
   universe's being a sort of mirror (speculum) in which God is to be
   seen. The Italian and French translators have the advantage of those of
   us who write English, for they have merely to transliterate the Latin
   word. We have a similar difficulty in the Latin word "vestigia," which
   I have translated traces. It will hardly do to write vestiges or
   footprints, and traces is not much better. St. Bonaventura simply means
   that by considering the work of art one will know the artist. This
   handiwork shows traces of his workmanship. But we are likely to think
   of traces as something which are left behind, whereas God is not to be
   thought of as having created the world and then left it alone, as
   Pascal said of Descartes' God.

     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER TWO

   OF THE REFLECTION OF GOD IN HIS TRACES IN THE SENSIBLE WORLD

   1. But since with respect to the mirror of sensible things it happens
   that God is contemplated not only through them, as by His traces, but
   also in them, in so far as He is in them by essence, potency, and
   presence; and to consider this is higher than the preceding; therefore
   a consideration of this sort holds next place as a second step in
   contemplation, by which we should be led to the contemplation of God in
   all creatures which enter into our minds through the bodily senses.

   2. Let it be noted then that this world, which is called the
   "macrocosm," enters our souls, which are called the "microcosm,"
   through the doors of the five senses, according to the apprehension,
   delectation, and judgment of sensible things themselves. This is
   apparent as follows: In the world some things are generating, some
   generated, some governing the former and the latter. The generating are
   simple bodies, celestial bodies, and the four elements. For from the
   elements, by virtue of the light which reconciles the contrariety of
   elements in mixtures, there can be generated and produced whatsoever
   things are generated and produced through the operation of a natural
   power. But the generated are bodies composed of the elements, like
   minerals, vegetables, sensible things, and human bodies. The rulers of
   the former and the latter are spiritual substances, either conjoined
   entirely, as are the animal souls; or conjoined though separable, as
   are the rational spirits; or entirely separated, as are the celestial
   spirits, which philosophers call "intelligences," but we "angels."
   These, according to the philosophers, move the celestial bodies; and
   thus there is attributed to them the administration of the universe by
   taking over from the First Cause, that is God, their active influence,
   which they pour out in accordance with the work of governing, which
   looks to the natural harmony of things. According to the theologians,
   however, there is attributed to them the rule of the universe in
   accordance with the power of the supreme God with respect to the work
   of reparation, wherefore they are called "ministering spirits," sent to
   minister to them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation [Hebr.
   1:14].

   3. Therefore, man, who is called a "microcosm," has five senses like
   five doors, through which enters into his soul the cognition of all
   that is in the sensible world. For through sight enter the transparent
   ("sublimia"), luminous, and other colored bodies; through touch the
   solid and terrestrial bodies; by the three intermediate senses the
   intermediates, as by taste the aqueous, by hearing the aerial, by odor
   the vaporous--all of which have something of a humid nature, something
   aerial, something fiery or warm, as appears in the smoke which is freed
   from incense.

   There enter then through these doors, not only simple bodies, but also
   composite, mixed from these. But since by sense we perceive not only
   these particular sensibles, which are light, sound, odor, savor, and
   the four primary qualities which touch apprehends, but also the common
   sensibles, which are number, magnitude, figure, rest, and motion, and
   since everything which is moved is moved by something, and some are
   self-moved and remain at rest, as the animals, it follows that when
   through these five senses we apprehend the motion of bodies, we are led
   to the cognition of spiritual movers, as through an effect we are led
   to a knowledge of its causes.

   4. As far as the three kinds of things are concerned, this whole
   sensible world enters into the human soul through "apprehension." The
   external sensibles, however, are what first enter the soul through the
   five doors of the senses. They enter, I say, not though their
   substance, but through their similitudes. These are first generated in
   the medium, and from the medium are generated in the organ and pass
   from the external organ into the internal, and from there into the
   apprehensive power. And thus the generation of the [sensible] species
   in the medium and from the medium into the organ and the reaction of
   the apprehensive power to it [the species] produce the apprehension of
   all those things which the soul apprehends from without.

   5. Upon this apprehension, if it be of the appropriate thing, there
   follows delight. Sense, however, takes delight in an object perceived
   through an abstracted similitude either by reason of its beauty, as in
   sight; or by reason of its agreeableness, as in odor and hearing; or by
   reason of wholesomeness, as in taste and touch, speaking with
   appropriation. [4] All delight, however, is by reason of proportion.
   But since a species is form, power, and operation, according to whether
   it is thought of as related to the principle from which it comes, to
   the medium through which it passes, or to the end for which it acts,
   therefore proportion may be considered in similitude, inasmuch as it is
   a species or form and thus is called "speciositas" [beauty], because
   beauty is nothing other than numerical equality or a certain relation
   of parts with agreeable color. Or else proportion may be considered as
   potency or power, and thus it is called "suavity," for active power
   does not exceed immoderately the powers of the recipient, since the
   senses are pained by extremes and delight in the mean. Or it may be
   considered, by thinking of species, as efficacy and impression, which
   is proportional when the agent by impression supplies what the
   recipient lacks; and this is to save and nourish it, which appears
   especially in taste and touch. And thus through delight the external
   pleasures enter into the soul by similitudes in a triple mode of
   delighting.

   6. After the delight of apprehension comes judgment. By this we not
   only judge whether something is white or black, for this pertains to a
   special sense, not only whether it is healthful or harmful, for this
   pertains to the inner sense, but also why something is delightful. And
   in this act the question is raised about the reasons for our delight
   which sense derives from the object. This happens when we ask why
   something is beautiful, pleasant, and wholesome. And it is discovered
   that the answer is equality of proportion. equality, however, is the
   same in the great and the small, and is not spread out through a
   thing's dimensions; nor does it change and pass away when there is
   alteration through change or motion. Therefore it abstracts from place,
   time, and motion, and thus is unchangeable, inimitable, without ends,
   and in all ways spiritual. Judgment is, therefore, an action which
   causes the sensible species, received sensibly through sense, to enter
   the intellective faculty by purification and abstraction. And thus the
   whole world can enter into the human soul through the doors of the
   senses by the three aforesaid operations.

   7. These all, however, are traces in which we can see the reflection of
   our God. For since the apprehended species is a likeness produced in
   the medium and then impressed upon the organ itself, and by means of
   that impression leads to its principle and source--that is to say, to
   the object of knowledge--manifestly it follows that the eternal light
   generates out of itself a likeness or coequal radiance which is
   consubstantial and coeternal. And He Who is the image and likeness of
   the invisible God [Col. 1:15] and "the brightness of His glory and the
   figure of His substance" [Hebr. 1:3], He Who is everywhere through His
   primal generation, as an object generates its likeness in the whole
   medium, is united by the grace of union to an individual of rational
   nature--as a species to a corporeal organ--so that by that union He may
   lead us back to the Father as to the primordial source and object. If
   then all knowable things can generate their likeness (species),
   obviously they proclaim that in them as in a mirror can be seen the
   eternal generation of the Word, the Image, and the Son, eternally
   emanating from God the Father.

   8. In this way the species, delighting us as beautiful, pleasant, and
   wholesome, implies that in that first species is the primal beauty,
   pleasure, and wholesomeness in which is the highest proportionality and
   equality to the generator. In this is power, not through imagination,
   but entering our minds through the truth of apprehension. Here is
   impression, salubrious and satisfying, and expelling all lack in the
   apprehending mind. If, then, delight is the conjunction of the
   harmonious, and the likeness of God alone is the most highly beautiful,
   pleasant, and wholesome, and if it is united in truth and in inwardness
   and in plenitude which employs our entire capacity, obviously it can be
   seen that in God alone is the original and true delight, and that we
   are led back to seeking it from all other delights.

   9. By a more excellent and immediate way are we led by judgment into
   seeing eternal truths more surely. For if judgment comes about through
   the reason's abstracting from place, time, and change, and therefore
   from dimension, succession, and transmutation, by the immutable,
   illimitable, and endless reason, and if there is nothing immutable,
   inimitable, and endless except the eternal, then all which is eternal
   is God or is in God. If, then, all things of which we have more certain
   judgments are judged by this mode of reasoning, it is clear that this
   is the reason of all things and the infallible rule and light of truth,
   in which all things shine forth infallibly, indestructibly,
   indubitably, irrefragably, unquestionably, unchangeably, boundlessly,
   endlessly, indivisibly, and intellectually. And therefore those laws by
   which we make certain judgments concerning all sensible things which
   come into our consideration--since they [the laws] are infallible and
   indubitable rules of the apprehending intellect--are indelibly stored
   up in the memory as if always present, are irrefragable and
   unquestionable rules of the judging intellect. And this is so because,
   as Augustine says [Lib. Arb., II, ch. 4], no one judges these things
   except by these rules. It must thus be true that they are incommutable
   and incorruptible since they are necessary, and boundless since they
   are inimitable, endless since eternal. Therefore they must be
   indivisible since intellectual and incorporeal, not made but uncreated,
   eternally existing in eternal art, by which, through which, and in
   accordance with which all things possessing form are formed. Neither,
   therefore, can we judge with certainty except through that which was
   not only the form producing all things but also the preserver of all
   and the distinguisher of all, as the being who preserves the form in
   all things, the directing rule by which our mind judges all things
   which enter into it through the senses.

   10. This observation is extended by a consideration of the seven
   different kinds of number by which, as if by seven steps, we ascend to
   God. Augustine shows this in his book "On the True Religion" and in the
   sixth book "On Music," wherein he assigns the differences of the
   numbers as they mount step by step from sensible things to the Maker of
   all things, so that God may be seen in all.

   For he says that numbers are in bodies and especially in sounds and
   words, and he calls these "sonorous." Some are abstracted from these
   and received into our senses, and these he calls "heard." Some proceed
   from the soul into the body, as appears in gestures and bodily
   movements, and these he calls "uttered." Some are in the pleasures of
   the senses which arise from attending to the species which have been
   received, and these he calls "sensual." Some are retained in the
   memory, and these he calls remembered. Some are the bases of our
   judgments about all these, and these he calls "judicial," which, as has
   been said above, necessarily transcend our minds because they are
   infallible and incontrovertible. By these there are imprinted on our
   minds the "artificial" numbers which Augustine does not include in this
   classification because they are connected with the judicial number from
   which flow the uttered numbers out of which are created the numerical
   forms of those things made by art. Hence, from the highest through the
   middles to the lowest, there is an ordered descent. Thence do we ascend
   step by step from the sonorous numbers by means of the uttered, the
   sensual, and the remembered.

   Since, therefore, all things are beautiful and in some way delightful,
   and beauty and delight do not exit apart from proportion, and
   proportion is primarily in number, it needs must be that all things are
   rhythmical ("numerosa"). And for this reason number is the outstanding
   exemplar in the mind of the Maker, and in things it is the outstanding
   trace leading to wisdom. Since this is most evident to all and closest
   to God, it leads most directly to God as if by the seven differentiae.
   It causes Him to be known in all corporeal and sensible thing while we
   apprehend the rhythmical, delight in rhythmical proportions, and though
   the laws of rhythmical proportions judge irrefragably.

   11. From these two initial steps by which we are led to seeing God in
   His traces, as if we had two wings falling to our feet, we can
   determine that all creatures of this sensible world lead the mind of
   the one contemplating and attaining wisdom to the eternal God; for they
   are shadows, echoes, and pictures, the traces, simulacra, and
   reflections of that First Principle most powerful, wisest, and best; of
   that light and plenitude; of that art productive, exemplifying, and
   ordering, given to us for looking upon God. They are signs divinely
   bestowed which, I say, are exemplars or rather exemplifications set
   before our yet untrained minds, limited to sensible things, so that
   through the sensibles which they see they may be carried forward to the
   intelligibles, which they do not see, as if by signs to the signified.

   12. The creatures of this sensible world signify the invisible things
   of God [Rom. 1:20], partly because God is of all creation the origin,
   exemplar, and end, and because every effect is the sign of its cause,
   the exemplification of the exemplar, and the way to the end to which it
   leads; partly from its proper representation; partly from prophetic
   prefiguration; partly from angelic operation; partly from further
   ordination. For every creature is by nature a sort of picture and
   likeness of that eternal wisdom, but especially that which in the book
   of Scripture is elevated by the spirit of prophecy to the prefiguration
   of spiritual things. But more does the eternal wisdom appear in those
   creatures in whose likeness God wished to appear in angelic ministry.
   And most specially does it appear in those which He wished to institute
   for the purpose of signifying which are not only signs according to
   their common name but also Sacraments.

   13. From all this it follows that the invisible things of God are
   clearly seen, from the creation of the world, being understood by the
   things that are made; so that those who are unwilling to give heed to
   them and to know God in them all, to bless Him and to love Him, are
   inexcusable [Rom. 1:20], while they are unwilling to be carried forth
   from the shadows into the wonderful light of God [I Cor. 15:57]. But
   thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord, Who has transported us
   out of darkness into His wonderful light, when through these lights
   given from without we are disposed to re- enter into the mirror of our
   mind, in which the divine lights shine [I Peter 2:9].

   ENDNOTES

   This may be a mistranslation. For St. Bonaventura may be talking about
   our perception of the heavenly bodies. Since, however, he is listing
   the three kinds of visible objects, one of which is clearly luminous,
   and since the heavenly bodies are luminous, he must he speaking of some
   kind of visible object which is not luminous. "Sublime" in classical
   Latin was used for the air, and this usage survives in the English
   verb, "sublimate," "to vaporize."

CHAPTER THREE

   OF THE REFLECTION OF GOD IN HIS IMAGE STAMPED UPON OUR NATURAL POWERS

   1. The two steps mentioned above, by leading us to God by means of His
   Traces, whereby He shines forth in all creatures, have led us to the
   point of entering into ourselves, that is, into our minds in which the
   divine image shines. Now in the third place, as we enter into
   ourselves, as if leaving the vestibule and coming into the sanctum,
   that is, the outer part of the tabernacle, we should strive to see God
   through a mirror. In this mirror the light of truth is shining before
   our minds as in a candelabrum, for in it gleams the resplendent image
   of the most blessed Trinity.

   Enter then into yourselves and see, for your mind loves itself most
   fervently. Nor could it love itself unless it knew itself. Nor would it
   know itself unless it remembered itself, for we receive nothing through
   intelligence which is not present to our memory. And from this be
   advised, not with the eye of the flesh but with that of reason, that
   your soul has a threefold power. Consider then the operations and the
   functions of these three powers, and you will be able to see God in
   yourselves as in an image, which is to see through a glass darkly [I
   Cor. 13:12].

   2. The operation of memory is retention and representation, not only of
   things present, corporeal, and temporal, but also of past and future
   things, simple and eternal. For memory retains the past by recalling
   it, the present by receiving it, the future by foreseeing it. It
   retains the simple, as the principles of continuous and discrete
   quantities--the point, the instant, the unit--without which it is
   impossible to remember or to think about those things whose source is
   in these. Nonetheless it retains the eternal principles and the axioms
   of the sciences and retains them eternally. For it can never so forget
   them while it uses reason that it will not approve of them when heard
   and assent to them, not as though it were perceiving them for the first
   time, but as if it were recognizing them as innate and familiar, as
   appears when someone says to another, ''One must either affirm or
   deny," or, "Every whole is greater than its part," or any other law
   which cannot be rationally contradicted.

   From the first actual retention of all temporal things, namely, of the
   past, present, and future, it has the likeness of eternity whose
   indivisible present extends to all times. From the second it appears
   that it is not only formed from without by images [phantasms], but also
   by receiving simple forms from above and retaining them in
   itself--forms which cannot enter through the doors of the senses and
   the images of sensible things. From the third it follows that it has an
   undying light present to itself in which it remembers unchangeable
   truths. And thus, through the operations of the memory, it appears that
   the soul itself is the image of God and His likeness, so present to
   itself and having Him present that it receives Him in actuality and is
   susceptible of receiving Him in potency, and that it can also
   participate in Him.

   3. The operation of the intellect is concerned with the meaning of
   terms, propositions, and inferences. The intellect however, understands
   the meaning of terms when it comprehends what anything is through its
   definition. But a definition must be made by higher terms and these by
   still higher, until one comes to the highest and most general, in
   ignorance of which the lower cannot be defined. Unless, therefore, it
   is known what is being-in-itself, the definition of no special
   substance can be fully known. For can being-in-itself be known unless
   it be known along with its conditions: the one, the true, the good.
   Since being, however, can be known as incomplete or complete, as
   imperfect or perfect, as potential or actual, as relative or absolute,
   as partial or total, as transient or permanent, as dependent or
   independent, as mixed with non-being or as pure, as contingent or
   necessary (per se), as posterior or prior, as mutable or immutable, as
   simple or composite; since privations and defects can be known only
   through affirmations in some positive sense, our intellect cannot reach
   the point of fully understanding any of the created beings unless it be
   favored by the understanding of the purest, most actual, most complete,
   and absolute Being, which is simply and eternally Being, and in which
   are the principles of all things in their purity. For how would the
   intellect know that a being is defective and incomplete if it had no
   knowledge of being free from all defect? And thus for all the aforesaid
   conditions.

   The intellect is said to comprehend truly the meaning of propositions
   when it knows with certitude that they are true. And to know this is
   simply to know, since error is impossible in comprehension of this
   sort. For it knows that such truth cannot be otherwise than it is. It
   knows, therefore, that such truth is unchangeable. But since our mind
   itself is changeable, it cannot see that truth shining forth
   unchangeably except by some light shining without change in any way;
   and it is impossible that such a light be a mutable creature. Therefore
   it knows in that light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into
   this world [John 1:9], which is true light and the Word which in the
   beginning was with God [John 1:1].

   Our intellect perceives truly the meaning of inference when it sees
   that a conclusion necessarily follows from its premises. This it sees
   not only in necessary terms but also in contingent. Thus if a man is
   running, a man is moving. It perceives, however, this necessary
   connection, not only in things which are, but also in things which are
   not. Thus if a man exists, it follows that if he is running, he is
   moved. And this is true even if the man is not existing. The necessity
   of this mode of inference comes not from the existence of the thing in
   matter, because that is contingent, nor from its existence in the soul
   because then it would be a fiction if it were not in the world of
   things. Therefore it comes from the archetype in eternal art according
   to which things have an aptitude and a comportment toward one another
   by reason of the representation of that eternal art. As Augustine says
   in his "On True Religion" [Ch. 39, 72], "The light of all who reason
   truly is kindled at that truth and strives to return to it." From which
   it is obvious that our intellect is conjoined with that eternal truth
   so that it cannot receive anything with certainty except under its
   guidance. Therefore you can see the truth through yourself, the truth
   that teaches you, if concupiscence and phantasms do not impede you and
   place themselves like clouds between you and the rays of truth.

   4. The operation of the power of choice is found in deliberation,
   judgment, and desire. Deliberation is found in inquiring what is
   better, this or that. But the better has no meaning except by its
   proximity to the best. But such proximity is measured by degrees of
   likeness. No one, therefore, can know whether this is better than that
   unless he knows that this is closer to the best. But no one knows that
   one of two things is more like another unless he knows the other. For I
   do not know that this man is like Peter unless I know or am acquainted
   with Peter. Therefore the idea of the good must be involved in every
   deliberation about the highest good.

   Certain judgment of the objects of deliberation comes about through
   some law. But none can judge with certainty through law unless he be
   certain that that law is right and that he ought not to judge it But
   the mind judges itself. Since, then, it cannot judge the law it employs
   in judgment, that law is higher than our minds, and through this higher
   law one makes judgments according to the degree with which it is
   impressed upon it. But there is nothing higher than the human mind
   except Him Who made it. Therefore our deliberative faculty in judging
   reaches upward to divine laws if it solves its problems completely.

   Now desire is of that which especially moves one. But that especially
   moves one which is especially loved. But happiness is loved above all.
   But happiness does not come about except through the best and ultimate
   end. Human desire, therefore, seeks nothing unless it be the highest
   good or something which leads to it or something which has some
   resemblance to it. So great is the force of the highest good that
   nothing can be loved except through desire for it by a creature which
   errs and is deceived when it takes truth's image and likeness for the
   truth.

   See then how close the soul is to God and how memory in its operations
   leads to eternity, intelligence to truth, the power of choice to the
   highest goodness.

   5. Following the order and origin and comportment of these powers, we
   are led to the most blessed Trinity itself. From memory arises
   intelligence as its offspring, for then do we know when a likeness
   which is in the memory leaps into the eye of the intellect, which is
   nothing other than a word. From memory and intelligence is breathed
   forth love, which is the tie between the two. These three--the
   generating mind, the word, and love--are in the soul as memory,
   intelligence, and will, which are consubstantial, coequal, and coeval,
   mutually immanent. If then God is perfect spirit, He has memory,
   intelligence, and will; and He has both the begotten Word and spirated
   Love. These are necessarily distinguished, since one is produced from
   the other--distinguished, not essentially or accidentally, but
   personally. When therefore the mind considers itself, it rises through
   itself as through a mirror to the contemplation of the Blessed
   Trinity-- Father, Word, and Love--three persons coeternal, coequal, and
   consubstantial; so that each one is in each of the others, though one
   is not the other, but all three are one God.

   6. This consideration which the soul has of its threefold and unified
   principle through the trinity of its powers, by which it is the image
   of God, is supported by the light of knowledge which perfects it and
   informs it, and represents in three ways the most blessed Trinity. For
   all philosophy is either natural or rational or moral. The first deals
   with the cause of being, and therefore leads to the power of the
   Father. The second deals with the principle of understanding, and
   therefore leads to the wisdom of the Word. The third deals with the
   order of living, and therefore leads to the goodness of the Holy
   Spirit.

   Again, the first is divided into metaphysics, mathematics, and physics.
   The first concerns the essences of things; the second, numbers and
   figures; the third, natures, powers, and extensive operations.
   Therefore the first to the First leads Principle, the Father; the
   second, to His image, the Son; the third, to the gift of the Holy
   Spirit.

   The second is divided into grammar, which gives us the power of
   expression; logic, which gives us skill in argumentation; rhetoric,
   which makes us skillful in persuasion or stirring the emotions. And
   this similarly images the mystery of the most blessed Trinity.

   The third is divided into individual, family, and political [problems].
   [5] And therefore the first images the First Principle, which has no
   birth; the second, the family relationship of the Son; the third, the
   liberality of the Holy Spirit.

   7. All these sciences have certain and infallible rules, like rays of
   light descending from the eternal law into our minds. And thus our
   minds, illumined and suffused by such great radiance, unless they be
   blind, can be led through themselves alone to the contemplation of that
   eternal light. The irradiation and consideration of this light holds
   the wise suspended in wonder; and, on the other hand, it leads into
   confusion the foolish, who do not believe that they may understand.
   Hence this prophecy is fulfilled: "Thou enlightenest wonderfully from
   the everlasting hills. All the foolish of heart were troubled" [Ps.
   75:5-6].

CHAPTER FOUR

   OF THE REFLECTION OF GOD IN HIS IMAGE REFORMED BY THE GIFTS OF GRACE

   1. But since not only by passing through ourselves but also within
   ourselves is it given to us to contemplate the First Principle, and
   this is greater than the preceding, therefore this mode of thought
   reaches to the fourth level of contemplation. It seems amazing,
   however, when it is clear that God is so near to our minds, that there
   are so few who see the First Principle in themselves. But the reason is
   close at hand. For the human mind, distracted by cares, does not enter
   into itself through memory; obscured by phantasms, it does not return
   into itself through intelligence; allured by concupiscence, it never
   returns to itself through the desire for inner sweetness and spiritual
   gladness. Thus, lying totally in this sensible world, it cannot return
   to itself as to the image of God.

   2. And since, when anyone lies fallen, he must remain there prostrate
   unless someone give a helping hand and he falls in order to rise again
   [Isaiah 24:20], our soul has not been able to be raised perfectly from
   the things of sense to an intuition of itself and of the eternal Truth
   in itself unless the Truth, having assumed human form in Christ, should
   make itself into a ladder, repairing the first ladder which was broken
   in Adam.

   Therefore, however much anyone is illuminated only by the light of
   nature and of acquired science, he cannot enter into himself that he
   may delight in the Lord in himself, unless Christ be his mediator, Who
   says, "I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved;
   and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures" [John 10:9].
   We do not, however, approach this door unless we believe in Him, hope
   in Him, and love Him. It is therefore necessary, if we wish to enter
   into the fruition of Truth, as into Paradise, that we enter through the
   faith, hope, and charity of the Mediator between God and man, Jesus
   Christ, Who is as the tree of life in the middle of Paradise.

   3. The image of our mind must therefore be clothed also in the three
   theological virtues by which the soul is purified, illuminated, and
   perfected; and thus the image is repaired and is made like the heavenly
   Jerusalem and part of the Church militant, which, according to the
   Apostle, is the child of the heavenly Jerusalem. For he says: "But that
   Jerusalem which is above is free, which is our mother" [Gal. 4:26].
   Therefore the soul which believes in, hopes in, and loves Jesus Christ,
   Who is the Word incarnate, uncreated, and spirated, that is, the way
   and the truth and the life, where by faith he believes in Christ as in
   the uncreated Word, which is the Word and the splendor of the Father,
   he recovers spiritual healing and vision: hearing to receive the
   lessons of Christ, vision to look upon the splendor of His light. When,
   however, he yearns with hope to receive the spirated Word, through
   desire and affection he recovers spiritual olfaction. When he embraces
   the incarnate Word in charity, as one receiving from Him delight and
   passing into Him through ecstatic love, he recovers taste and touch.
   When these senses are recovered, when he sees his spouse and hears,
   smells, tastes, and embraces Him, he can sing like the Bride a Canticle
   of Canticles, as was done on the occasion of this fourth stage of
   contemplation, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it [Apoc.
   2:17]. For it occurs in affective experience rather than in rational
   consideration. On this level, when the inner senses are renewed in
   order to perceive the highest beauty, to hear the highest harmony,
   smell the highest fragrance, taste the highest delicacy, apprehend the
   highest delights, the soul is disposed to mental elevation through
   devotion, wonder, and exultation, in accordance with those three
   exclamations which are in the Canticle of Canticles. Of these the first
   arises from the abundance of devotion, by which the soul becomes like a
   pillar of smoke of aromatic spices, of myrrh and frankincense [Cant.
   3:6]; the second, from the excellence of wonder, by which the soul
   becomes as the dawn, the moon, and the sun, like the series of
   illuminations which suspend the soul in wonder as it considers its
   spouse; the third, from the superabundance of exultation, by which the
   soul, overflowing with the sweetest delight, leans totally upon its
   beloved [Cant. 8:5].

   4. When this is accomplished, our spirit is made hierarchical to mount
   upward through its conformity to the heavenly Jerusalem, into which no
   one enters unless through grace it has descended into his heart, as
   John saw in his Apocalypse [21, 2]. But then it descends into one's
   heart when, by the reformation of the image through the theological
   virtues and through the delights of the spiritual senses and ecstatic
   elevation, our spirit has been made hierarchical, that is, purged,
   illuminated, and perfected. Likewise the soul is stamped by the
   following nine steps when it is disposed in an orderly way: perception,
   deliberation, self-impulsion, ordination, strengthening, command,
   reception, divine illumination, union, [6] which one by one correspond
   to the nine orders of angels, so that the first three stages correspond
   to nature in the human mind, the next three to industry, and the last
   three to grace. [7] With these acquired, the soul, entering into
   itself, enters into the heavenly Jerusalem, where, considering the
   orders of the angels, it sees God in them, Who living in them causes
   all their operations. Whence Bernard said to Eugenius that--

   "God in the seraphim loves as Charity, in the Cherubim He knows as
   Truth, in the Thrones He is seated as Equity, in the Dominations He
   dominates as Majesty, in the Principalities He rules as the First
   Principle, in the Powers He watches over us as Salvation, in the
   Virtues He operates as Virtue, in the Archangels He reveals as Light,
   in the Angels He aids as Piety." [8]

   From all of which God is seen to be all in all through the
   contemplation of Him in the minds in which He dwells through the gifts
   of His overflowing Charity.

   5. For this grade of contemplation there is especially and
   outstandingly added as a support the consideration of Holy Scripture
   divinely issued, as philosophy was added to the preceding. For Holy
   Scripture is principally concerned with the works of reparation.
   Wherefore it especially deals with faith, hope, and charity, by which
   the soul is reformed, and most of all with charity. Concerning this the
   Apostle says that the end of the Commandments is reached by a pure
   heart and a good conscience and an unfeigned faith [I Tim. 1:5]. This
   is the fulfillment of the Law, as he says. And our Saviour adds that
   all the Law and the Prophets depend upon these two Commandments: the
   love of God and of one's neighbor. Which two are united in the one
   spouse of the Church, Jesus Christ, Who is at once neighbor and God, at
   once brother and Lord, at once king and friend, at once Word uncreated
   and incarnate, our maker and remaker, the alpha and omega. He is the
   highest hierarch, purging and illuminating and perfecting His spouse,
   the whole Church and any holy soul.

   6. Of this hierarch and this ecclesiastical hierarchy is the entire
   Holy Scripture by which we are taught to be purified, illuminated, and
   perfected, and this according to the triple law handed down to us in
   it: the law of Nature, of Scripture, and of Grace; or rather according
   to the triple principal part of it: the Mosaic Law purifying, the
   prophetic revelation illuminating, and evangelical teaching perfecting;
   or above all, according to the triple spiritual meaning of it--the
   tropological which purifies us for an honest life, the allegorical
   which illuminates us for the clarity of understanding, the analogical
   which perfects us by mental elevation and the most delightful
   perceptions of wisdom--in accordance with the three aforesaid
   theological virtues and the spiritual senses reformed and the three
   above-mentioned stages of elevation and hierarchical acts of the mind,
   by which our mind retreats into itself so that it may look upon God in
   the brightness of the saints [Ps. 109:3] and in them, as in a chamber,
   it may sleep in peace and take its rest [Ps. 4:9] while the spouse
   adjures it that it stir not up till she pleases [Cant. 2:7].

   7. Now from these two middle steps, by which we proceed to contemplate
   God within ourselves as in the mirrors of created images--and this as
   with wings opened for flying which hold the middle place--we can
   understand that we are led into the divine by the powers of the
   rational soul itself placed therein by nature as far as their
   operations, habits, and knowledge are concerned, as appears from the
   third stage. For we are led by the powers of the soul reformed by
   virtues freely granted, by the spiritual senses, and by mental
   elevation, as appears from the fourth stage. We are nonetheless led
   through hierarchical operations, that is, by purgation, illumination,
   and perfection of human minds through the hierarchical revelations of
   the Holy Scriptures given to us, according to the Apostle, through the
   Angels in the hand of a mediator [Gal. 3:19]. And finally we are led by
   hierarchies and hierarchical orders which are found to be ordered in
   our minds in the likeness of the heavenly Jerusalem.

   8. Our mind, filled with all these intellectual illuminations, is
   inhabited by the divine wisdom as the house of God; become the
   daughter, the spouse, and the friend of God; made a member of Christ
   the head, the sister, and the fellow-heir; made nonetheless the temple
   of the Holy Spirit, founded by faith, elevated by hope, and dedicated
   to God by the sanctity of the mind and the body. All of this has been
   brought about by the most sincere love of Christ which is poured forth
   into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, Who is given to us [Rom. 5:5],
   without which Spirit we cannot know the secrets of God. For just as no
   one can know the things of a man except the spirit of a man that is in
   him, so the things also that are of God no man knoweth but the spirit
   of God [I Cor. 2:11] In charity then let us be rooted and founded, that
   we may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length of
   eternity, the breadth of liberality, the height of majesty and the
   depth of the wisdom which judges us [Eph. 3:17-18].

CHAPTER FIVE

   OF THE REFLECTION OF THE DIVINE UNITY IN ITS PRIMARY NAME WHICH IS
   BEING

   1. It happens that we may contemplate God not only outside of us but
   also within us and above us. [Thus we contemplate Him] outside through
   His traces, inside through His image, and above us through His light,
   which has signed upon our minds the light of eternal Truth, since the
   mind itself is immediately formed by Truth itself. Those who exercise
   themselves in the first manner have already entered into the atrium of
   the tabernacle; the second have entered into the sanctum; but the third
   have entered into the Holy of Holies with the High Priest, the Holy of
   Holies where above the ark are the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the
   propitiatory. By these modes we understand two ways or degrees of
   contemplation of the invisible and eternal things of God, of which one
   deals with God's essential attributes, the other with the properties of
   the Persons.

   2. The first way first and foremost signifies Him in Being itself,
   saying He Who Is is the primary name of God. The second signifies Him
   in His goodness, saying this [goodness] is the primary name of God. The
   former refers above all to the Old Testament, which preaches the unity
   of the divine essence, whence it was said to Moses, "I am Who I am."
   The second refers to the New Testament, which lays down the plurality
   of the Persons, by baptizing in the name of the Father and of the Son
   and of the Holy Spirit. Therefore our Master Christ, wishing to elevate
   the youth who had served the law to evangelical perfection, attributed
   the name of goodness principally and precisely to God. No one, He said,
   is good but God alone [Luke 18:19]. Damascenus ["De fide orthodox.," 1,
   9] therefore, following Moses, says that "He Who Is" is the primary
   name of God. Dionysius, following Christ, says that goodness is God's
   primary name.

   3. If you wish then to contemplate the invisible traits of God in so
   far as they belong to the unity of His essence, fix your gaze upon
   Being itself, and see that Being is most certain in itself; for it
   cannot be thought not to be, since the purest Being occurs only in full
   flight from Non-Being, just as nothingness is in full flight from
   Being. Therefore, just as the utterly nothing contains nought of Being
   nor of its conditions, so contrariwise Being itself contains no
   Non-Being, neither in actuality nor in potency, neither in matters of
   fact nor in our thinking. Since, however, Non-Being is the privation of
   Being, it cannot enter the intellect except through Being; Being,
   however, cannot enter through anything other than itself. For
   everything which is thought of is either thought of as Non- Being or as
   Being-in-potency or as Being-in-actuality. If, therefore, Non- Being is
   intelligible only through Being, and if Being-in-potency can be
   understood only through Being-in-actuality, and if Being is the name of
   that pure actuality of Being, Being then is what first enters the
   intellect, and that Being is pure actuality. But this is not particular
   Being, which is restricted Being, since that is mixed with
   potentiality. Nor is this analogous Being, for such has a minimum of
   actuality since it has only a minimum of being. It remains, therefore,
   that that Being is divine Being.

   4. Marvelous then is the blindness of the intellect which does not
   consider that which is its primary object and without which it can know
   nothing. But just as the eye intent upon the various differences of the
   colors does not see the light by which it sees the other things and, if
   it sees it, does not notice it, so the mind's eye, intent upon
   particular and universal beings, does not notice Being itself, which is
   beyond all genera, though that comes first before the mind and through
   it all other things. Wherefore it seems very true that just as the
   bat's eye behaves in the light, so the eye of the mind behaves before
   the most obvious things of nature. Because accustomed to the shadows of
   beings and the phantasms of the sensible world, when it looks upon the
   light of the highest Being, it seems to see nothing, not understanding
   that darkness itself is the fullest illumination of the mind [Ps.
   138:11], just as when the eye sees pure light it seems to itself to be
   seeing nothing.

   5. See then purest Being itself, if you can, and you will understand
   that it cannot be thought of as derivative from another. And thus
   necessarily that must be thought of as absolutely primal which can be
   derivative neither from nothing nor from anything. For what exists
   through itself if Being does not exist through itself and of itself?
   You will understand that, lacking Non-Being in every respect and
   therefore having no beginning nor end, it is eternal. You will
   understand also that it contains nothing in itself save Being itself,
   for it is in no way composite, but is most simple. You will understand
   that it has no potentialities within it, since every possible has in
   some way something of Non-Being, but Being is the highest actuality.
   You will understand that it has no defect, for it is most perfect.
   Finally, you will understand that it has no diversity, for it is One in
   the highest degree.

   Being, therefore, which is pure Being and most simply Being and
   absolutely Being, is Being primary, eternal, most simple, most actual,
   most perfect, and one to the highest degree.

   6. And these things are so certain that Being itself cannot be thought
   of by an intellect as opposed to these, and one of these traits implies
   the others. For since it is simply Being, therefore it is simply
   primary; because it is simply primary, therefore it is not made from
   another nor from itself, and therefore it is eternal. Likewise, since
   it is primary and eternal, and therefore not from others, it is
   therefore most simple. Furthermore, since it is primary, eternal, and
   most simple, therefore it contains no potentiality mixed with
   actuality, and therefore it is most actual. Likewise, since it is
   primary, eternal, most simple, most actual, it is most perfect. To such
   a Being nothing is lacking, nor can anything be added, Since it is
   primary, eternal, most simple, most actual, most perfect, it is
   therefore one to the highest degree. For what is predicated because of
   its utter superabundance is applicable to all things. For what is
   simply predicated because of superabundance cannot possibly be applied
   to anything but the one. [9] Wherefore, if God is the name of the
   primary, eternal, most simple, most actual, most perfect Being, it is
   impossible that He be thought of as not being nor as anything save One
   alone. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God." If you see this
   in the pure simplicity of your mind, you will somehow be infused with
   the illumination of eternal light.

   7. But you have ground for rising in wonder. For Being itself is first
   and last, is eternal and yet most present, is simplest and greatest, is
   most actual and immutable, is perfect and immense, is most highly one
   and yet all inclusive. If you wonder over these things with a pure
   mind, while you look further, you will be infused with a greater light,
   until you finally see that Being is last because it is first. For since
   it is first, it produces all things for its own sake alone; and
   therefore it must be the very end, the beginning and the consummation,
   the alpha and the omega. Therefore it is most present because it is
   eternal. For since it is eternal, it does not come from another; nor
   does it cease to be nor pass from one thing to another, and therefore
   has no past nor future but only present being. Therefore it is greatest
   because most simple. For since it is most simple in essence, therefore
   it is greatest in power; because power, the more greatly it is unified,
   the closer it is to the infinite. Therefore it is most immutable,
   because most actual. For that which is most actual is therefore pure
   act. And as such it acquires nothing new nor does it lose what it had,
   and therefore cannot be changed. Therefore it is most immense, because
   most perfect. For since it is most perfect, nothing can be thought of
   which is better, nobler, or more worthy. And on this account there is
   nothing greater. And every such thing is immense. Therefore it is
   all-inclusive ("omnimodal"), because it is one to the highest degree.
   For that which is one to the highest degree is the universal source of
   all multiplicity. And for this reason it is the universal efficient
   cause of all things, the exemplary and the final cause, as the cause of
   Being, the principle of intelligibility, the order of living. [10] And
   therefore it is all-inclusive, not as the essence of all things, but as
   the superexcellent and most universal and most sufficient cause of all
   essences, whose power, because most highly unified in essence, is
   therefore most highly infinite and most fertile in efficacy.

   8. Recapitulating, let us say: Because, then, Being is most pure and
   absolute, that which is Being simply is first and last and, therefore,
   the origin and the final cause of all. Because eternal and most
   present, therefore it encompasses and penetrates all duration, existing
   at once as their center and circumference. Because most simple and
   greatest, therefore it is entirely within and entirely without all
   things and, therefore, is an intelligible sphere whose center is
   everywhere and whose circumference nowhere. Because most actual and
   most immutable, then "remaining stable it causes the universe to move"
   [Boethius, Cons. III, met. 9]. Because most perfect and immense,
   therefore within all, though not included in them; beyond all, but not
   excluded from them; above all, but not transported beyond them; below
   all, and yet not cast down beneath them. Because most highly one and
   all-inclusive, therefore all in all, although all things are many and
   it is only one. And this is so since through most simple unity,
   clearest truth, and most sincere goodness there is in it all power, all
   exemplary causality, and all communicability. And therefore from it and
   by it and in it are all things. And this is so since it is omnipotent,
   omniscient, and all-good. And to see this perfectly is to be blessed.
   As was said to Moses, "I will show thee all good" [Exod. 33:19].

CHAPTER SIX

   OF THE REFLECTION OF THE MOST BLESSED TRINITY IN ITS NAME, WHICH IS
   GOOD

   1. After a consideration of the essential traits [of God] the eye of
   the intelligence must be raised to look upon the most Blessed Trinity,
   in order that the second Cherub may be placed next to the first. Just
   as Being is the root and name of the vision of the essential traits, so
   Good is the principal foundation of our contemplation of the divine
   emanations [of the Trinity].

   2. See then and pay heed, since the best which exists simply is that
   than which nothing better can be thought of. And this is such that it
   cannot be rightly thought not to be. For Being is in all ways better
   than Non-Being. This is such that it cannot rightly be thought of
   unless conceived of as both three and one. For the Good is said to be
   self-diffusive. The highest good is therefore the most self-diffusive.
   The greatest diffusion, however, can exist only if it is actual and
   intrinsic, substantial and hypostatic, natural and voluntary, free and
   necessary, lacking nothing and perfect. Unless, then, there be
   eternally in the highest good a production which is actual and
   consubstantial, and an hypostasis as noble as the producer through
   generation and spiration, so that it would be from the eternal
   principle eternally co-producing and would be beloved ("dilectus") in
   itself and co-loved ("condilectus"), generated, and spirated as are the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, in no way would it be the
   highest good, for it would not diffuse itself most highly. For temporal
   diffusion in creation is nothing else than central and punctiform with
   respect to the immensity of the eternal goodness. Whence also can some
   diffusion be conceived as greater than that--to wit, that in which the
   diffusive power communicates its whole substance and nature to another.
   Therefore the highest good would not exist if it could lack that
   characteristic either in existence or in thought.

   If then you can look with the mind's eye upon the purity of goodness,
   which is the pure actualization of the principle of Charity, pouring
   forth free and due love, and both mingled together, which is the
   fullest diffusion according to nature and will--the diffusion as Word,
   in which all things are expressed, and as Gift, in which all other
   gifts are given--you may see by the highest communicability of the Good
   that a Trinity of Father and Son and Holy Spirit is necessary. Because
   of the greatest goodness, it is necessary that there be in them the
   greatest communicability, and out of the greatest communicability the
   greatest consubstantiality, and from the greatest consubstantiality the
   greatest configurability, and from all these the greatest coequality;
   and therefore the greatest coeternity as well as, because of all the
   aforesaid, the greatest co-intimacy, by which one is in the other
   necessarily through the highest degree of mutual penetration and one
   operates with the other through the complete identity of substances and
   power and operation of the most Blessed Trinity itself.

   3. But when you contemplate these things, see that you do not think
   yourself able to understand the incomprehensible. For you have still in
   these six stages to consider what most strongly leads our mind's eye
   into the stupor of wonder. For there [in the Trinity] is the greatest
   communicability with individuality of the persons, the greatest
   consubstantiality with plurality of the hypostases, the greatest
   configurability with distinct personality, the greatest co-equality
   with order, the greatest co-eternity with emanation, the greatest
   mutual intimacy with mission. Who in the face of such great marvels
   would not start in wonder? But we understand with greatest certitude
   that all these exist in the most Blessed Trinity if we raise our eyes
   to the goodness that excels all goodness. For if there is the greatest
   communication and true diffusion, there is also true origin and true
   distinction. And because the whole and not the part is communicated,
   therefore it is itself given as a whole and not as a part. Therefore
   the one emanating and the one producing are distinguished by their
   properties, and yet arc essentially one. Since, then, they are
   distinguished by their properties, therefore they have personal
   properties and a plurality of hypostases and an emanation of origin and
   an order which is not of posteriority but of origin, and a mission not
   of local change but of free spiration, because of the authority of the
   producer which every sender has in respect to that which is sent.
   Because they are substantially one, therefore it must be true that
   there is unity in essence and in form, In dignity and in eternity, in
   existence and inimitability While therefore you consider these things
   one by one in themselves, you have a reason for contemplating the truth
   ; when you compare them with one another, you have the wherewithal to
   hover in highest wonder; and therefore, that your mind may ascend in
   wonder to wonderful contemplation these things should be considered all
   together.

   4. For these Cherubim signify this also, since they look at each other.
   Nor is this free from mystery, that they look toward each, their faces
   being turned toward the propitiatory [Exod. 25:20], that there may be
   verified what the Lord said in John, "Now this is the eternal life:
   That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, Whom thou
   hast sent" [John 17:3]. For we should wonder not only at the essential
   and personal traits of God in themselves, but also in comparison with
   the superwonderful union of God and man in the unity of Christ's
   person.

   5. For if you are the Cherub when you contemplate the essentials of God
   and you wonder because the divine Being is at once primary and last
   Being, eternal and most present most simple and greatest or unlimited,
   all everywhere and yet never bounded, most actual and never moved, most
   perfect and having nothing superfluous or lacking, and yet immense and
   infinite without bounds, one to the highest degree and yet
   all-inclusive as having all things in itself, as total power, total
   truth, total goodness, look to the propitiatory and wonder that in it
   the primal principle is joined to the last term, God joined with man
   formed on the sixth day, the eternal joined with temporal man, born in
   the fullness of time of a Virgin--the most simple joined with the most
   composite, the most actual with the most passive and mortal, the most
   perfect and immense with the little, the most highly unified and
   all-inclusive with the composite individual distinct from all else,
   namely, Jesus Christ

   6. If, however, you are the other Cherub when you contemplate the
   properties of the Persons, you will also wonder that communicability
   exists with individuality, consubstantiality with plurality,
   configurability with personality, co-equality with order, co-eternity
   with production, co- intimacy with mission, for the Son was sent by the
   Father, and the Holy Spirit by both, Who nevertheless is always with
   Them and never withdraws from Them. Look to the propitiatory and wonder
   because in Christ is a personal union with a trinity of substances and
   a duality of natures, an absolute agreement with a plurality of wills,
   a common speech between God and man with plurality of properties, an
   equal worship with plurality of ranks, an equal exaltation above all
   things with plurality of dignities, a condominium with plurality of
   powers

   7. In this consideration is the perfection of the mind's illumination,
   when, as if on the sixth day, it sees man made in the image of God. If
   then the image is an express likeness when our mind contemplates in
   Christ the Son of God, Who is the natural image of the invisible God,
   our humanity now wonderfully exalted, now ineffably united, by seeing
   at once in one Being the first and the last, the highest and the
   lowest, the circumference and the center, the alpha and the omega, the
   caused and the cause, the creator and the creature, the book written
   within and without, it [the mind] arrives at a perfect being in order
   that it may arrive with God at the perfection of His illuminations on
   the sixth level, as if on the sixth day; nor does anything more remain
   save the day of rest, on which, by the elevation of the mind, its
   insight rests from all work which He had done.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER SEVEN

   OF MENTAL AND MYSTICAL ELEVATION, IN WHICH REPOSE IS GIVEN TO THE
   INTELLECT WHEN THE AFFECTIONS PASS ENTIRELY INTO GOD THOUGH ELEVATION

   1. Now that these six considerations have been studied as the six steps
   of the true throne of Solomon by which one ascends to peace, where the
   truly peaceful man reposes in peace of mind as if in the inner
   Jerusalem; as if, again, on the six wings of the Cherub by which the
   mind of the truly contemplative man grows strong to rise again, filled
   with the illumination of supreme wisdom; as if, once again, during the
   first six days in which the mind has to be exercised that it may
   finally arrive at the Sabbath of rest after it has beheld God outside
   itself through His traces and in His traces, within itself by His image
   and in His image, above itself by the likeness of the divine light
   shining down upon us and in that light, in so far as is possible in
   this life and the exercise of our mind-- when, finally, on the sixth
   level we have come to the point of beholding in the first and highest
   principle and the Mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ, those things
   of which the likeness cannot in any wise be found in creatures and
   which exceed all the insight of the human intellect, there remains that
   by looking upon these things it [the mind] rise on high and pass beyond
   not only this sensible world but itself also. In this passage Christ is
   the way and the door, Christ is the stairway and the vehicle, like the
   propitiatory over the ark of God and the mystery which has been hidden
   from eternity [Eph 3:9].

   2. He who with full face looks to this propitiatory by looking upon Him
   suspended on the cross in faith, hope, and charity, in devotion,
   wonder, exultation, appreciation, praise, and jubilation, makes a
   passover--that is, the phase or passage [Exod. 12:11] with Him--that he
   may pass over the Red Sea by the staff of the cross from Egypt into the
   Desert, where he may taste the hidden manna and with Christ may rest in
   the tomb as if outwardly dead, yet knowing, as far as possible in our
   earthly condition, what was said on the cross to the thief cleaving to
   Christ: ''Today thou shalt be with me in Paradise."

   3. That was shown to the blessed Francis when, in the transport of
   contemplation on the high mountain--where I thought out these things
   which I have written--there appeared to him the Seraph with the six
   wings nailed to the cross, as I and several others have heard from the
   companion who was with him when he passed over into God through the
   transports of contemplation and became the example of perfect
   contemplation, just as previously he had been of action; as another
   Jacob is changed into Israel, so through him all truly spiritual men
   have been invited by God to passage of this kind and to mental
   transport by example rather than by word.

   4. In this passage, if it is perfect, all intellectual operations
   should be abandoned, and the whole height of our affection should be
   transferred and transformed into God. This, however, is mystical and
   most secret, which no man knoweth but he that hath received it [Apoc.
   2:17], nor does he receive it unless he desire it; nor does he desire
   it unless the fire of the Holy Spirit, Whom Christ sent to earth, has
   inflamed his marrow. And therefore the Apostle says that this mystic
   wisdom is revealed through the Holy Spirit.

   5. Since, therefore, nature is powerless in this matter and industry
   but slightly able, little should be given to inquiry but much to
   unction, little to the tongue but much to inner joy, little to the word
   and to writings and all to the gift of God, that is, to the Holy
   Spirit, little or nothing to creation and all to the creative essence,
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, saying with Dionysius to God the Trinity:

   "Trinity, superessential and superdivine and supergood guardian of
   Christian knowledge of God, direct thou us into the more-than-unknown
   and superluminous and most sublime summit of mystical eloquence, where
   new and absolute and unchangeable mysteries of theology are deeply
   hidden, according to the superluminous darkness of instructive
   silence--darkness which is supermanifest and superresplendent, and in
   which all is aglow, pouring out upon the invisible intellects the
   splendors of invisible goodness." [11] This to God. To the friend,
   however, to whom I address this book, let me say with the same
   Dionysius:

   "Thou then, my friend, if thou desirest mystic visions, with
   strengthened feet abandon thy senses and intellectual operations, and
   both sensible and invisible things, and both all nonbeing and being;
   and unknowingly restore thyself to unity as far as possible, unity of
   Him Who is above all essence and knowledge. And when thou hast
   transcended thyself and all things in immeasurable and absolute purity
   of mind, thou shalt ascend to the superessential rays of divine
   shadows, leaving all behind and freed from ties of all." [12]

   6. If you should ask how these things come about, question grace, not
   instruction; desire, not intellect; the cry of prayer, not pursuit of
   study; the spouse, not the teacher; God, not man; darkness, not
   clarity; not light, but the wholly flaming fire which will bear you
   aloft to God with fullest unction and burning affection. This fire is
   God, and the furnace of this fire leadeth to Jerusalem; and Christ the
   man kindles it in the fervor of His burning Passion, which he alone
   truly perceives who says, "My soul rather chooseth hanging and my bones
   death" [Job 7:15]. He who chooses this death can see God because this
   is indubitably true: "Man shall not see me and live" [Exod. 33:20]. Let
   us then die and pass over into darkness; let us impose silence on
   cares, concupiscence, and phantasms; let us pass over with the
   crucified Christ from this world to the Father [John 13:1], so that
   when the Father is shown to us we may say with Philip, "It is enough
   for us" [John 14:8]; let us hear with Paul, "My grace is sufficient for
   thee" [II Cor. 12:9]; let us exult with David, saying, "For Thee my
   flesh and my heart hath fainted away; Thou art the God of my heart, and
   the God that is my portion forever [Ps. 72, 26]. . . . Blessed be the
   Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting; and let all the
   people say: So be it, so be it" [Ps. 105:48]. AMEN.
