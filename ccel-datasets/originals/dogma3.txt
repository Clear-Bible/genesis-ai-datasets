EDITOR'S PREFACE.

   The first chapter in this volume forms the concluding chapter of the
   First Volume of the German Work. It answers to the Seventh Chapter of
   the Second Book of the first great division of the subject, which has
   for its aim to shew the origin of Ecclesiastical Dogma. The First Book
   treats of the Preparation for Dogma; the Second of the Laying of the
   Foundation. This Second Book begins with the second volume of the
   English Translation, and closes with the first chapter of the third
   volume now published. Thereafter commences the Second Part of the Work,
   which deals with the Development of Dogma. The numbering of the
   chapters here begins anew, running on from I. to VI.

   The Second Volume of the German Work commences with the Second Part,
   and tells the story of the Development of Dogma till the time of
   Augustine. Only a portion of it appears in this volume. The remainder
   will form the contents of the Fourth Volume. The author has prefixed to
   the volume two prefaces, one to the first, the other to the third
   Edition. These are here given.

   The Appendix on Manich√¶ism is the last of four which appear at the end
   of the first volume of the German Edition. The first three of these
   will be found at the end of the first volume of the English Edition.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION OF VOLUME II. OF THE GERMAN WORK.

   THE first half of the second part of the History of Dogma is here given
   apart and as the second volume, because it is complete in itself, and I
   shall be prevented from completing the work at once by other tasks.

   The account contained in the following pages would have been shorter,
   if I could have persuaded myself of the correctness of the opinion,
   that a single, all-determining thought obtained its true development in
   the History of Dogma from the fourth to the eighth century. This
   opinion dominates, apart from a few monographs, all writings on the
   History of Dogma, and gives a uniform impress to the accounts of
   Protestants and Catholics. I share it within certain limits; but these
   very limits, which I have endeavoured to define, [1] have not yet
   received due attention. In the fourth century the formula that was
   correct, when judged by the conception of redemption of the ancient
   Church, prevailed; but the Fathers, who finally secured its triumph,
   did not give it the exposition which it originally demanded. In the
   fifth century, or the seventh, on the contrary, a formula that,
   measured by the same standard, was incorrect, prevailed; yet it was
   associated with an exposition that to some extent compensated for the
   incorrectness. In both cases, however, the imperfections of the
   conclusion, which are explained from various circumstances, became of
   the highest importance. For in them we find the reason why the phantom
   Christ did not wholly oust the historical; and, in order to overcome
   them, men turned anew to Philosophy, especially to Aristotle. The
   orthodox Church owes two things to the incorrect form in which the
   Trinitarian and Christological Dogma was finally stated: (1) contact
   with the Gospel, and (2) renewed contact with ancient science, i.e.,
   scholasticism.

   The account of these conditions demanded a more minute discussion of
   the process of the History of Dogma, than is usual in the ordinary
   text-books. Dogma developed slowly and amid great obstacles. No single
   step should be overlooked in the description, and, in particular, the
   period between the fourth and fifth Councils is not less important than
   any other. Political relationships, at no point decisive by themselves,
   yet everywhere required, as well as western influences, careful
   attention. I should have discussed them still more thoroughly, if I had
   not been restrained by considerations of the extent of the book. I have
   included the state of affairs and developments in the West, so far as
   they were related to, and acted upon, those in the East. In the
   following Book I shall begin with Augustine. The scientific theological
   expositions of the Fathers have only been brought under review, where
   they appeared indispensable for the understanding of Dogma. In any case
   I was not afraid of doing too much here. I am convinced that a shorter
   description ought not to be offered to students of Theology, unless it
   were to be a mere guide. The history of Christian Dogma--perhaps the
   most complicated history of development which we can completely
   review--presents the investigator with the greatest difficulties; and
   yet it is, along with the study of the New Testament, and in the
   present position of Protestantism, the most important discipline for
   every one who seeks really to study Theology. The theologian who leaves
   the University without being thoroughly familiar with it, is, in the
   most critical questions, helplessly at the mercy of the authorities of
   the day. But the royal way to the understanding of the History of
   Dogma, opened up by F. Chr. Baur, and pursued by Thomasius, does not
   lead to the goal; for by it we become acquainted with the historical
   matter only in the abbreviated form required for the defence of the
   completed Dogma.

   The history of the development of Dogma does not offer the lofty
   interest, which attaches to that of its genesis. When we return from
   the most complicated and elaborate doctrinal formulas, from the
   mysticism of the Cultus and Christian Neoplatonism, from the worship of
   saints and ceremonial ritual of the seventh and eighth centuries, back
   to Origen and the third century, we are astonished to find that all we
   have mentioned was really in existence at the earlier date. Only it
   existed. then amid a mass of different material, and its footing was
   insecure In many respects the whole historical development of Dogma
   from the fourth century to John of Damascus and Theodore of Studion was
   simply a vast process of reduction, selection, and definition. In the
   East we are no longer called upon to deal in any quarter with new and
   original matter, but always rather with what is traditional,
   derivative, and, to an increasing extent, superstitious. Yet that to
   which centuries devoted earnest reflection, holding it to be sacred,
   will never lose its importance, as long as there still exists among us
   a remnant of the same conditions which belonged to those times. But who
   could deny that those conditions--in the Church and in learning --are
   still powerful among us? Therefore even the religious formulas are
   still in force which were created in the Byzantine age; nay, they are
   the dogmas kat' exoche'n in all Churches, so that the popular idiom is
   nowise wrong which with the word "dogma" primarily designates the
   doctrines of the Trinity and the divine humanity of Christ. The
   inquirer who follows the development of these dogmas after the fourth
   century, and who, owing to the want of originality and freshness in his
   material, loses pleasure in his work, is ever and again reanimated,
   when he considers that he has to deal with matters which have gained,
   and still exercise, an immense power over the feelings and minds of
   men. And how much it is still possible for us to learn, as free
   Evangelical Christians, especially after generations of scholars have
   dedicated to this history the most devoted industry, so that no one can
   enter into their labours without becoming their disciples!

   I know very well that it would be possible to treat the material
   reviewed in this book more universally than I have done. My chief
   purpose was to show how matters arose and were in their concrete
   manifestation. But the task of making dogma really intelligible in all
   its aspects within the limits of a History of Dogma, is after all as
   insoluble as any similar problem which isolates a single object from
   Universal History, and requires its investigation in and by itself.
   This limitation I need only recall. But something further has to be
   said. Dogmas, undoubtedly, admit of a process of refinement, which
   would bring them closer to our understanding and our feeling. But my
   powers are not equal to this lofty task, and even if I possessed the
   uncommon qualities of the psychologist and the religious philosopher, I
   should have hesitated about employing them in this book; for I did not
   wish to endanger the reliability of what I had to present by
   reflections, which must always remain more or less subjective. Thus I
   have limited myself to a few hints; these will only be found where the
   nature of the material itself induced me to seek for the far remote
   thought underlying the expression.

   I have throughout striven in this volume, to give such an account as
   would demand to be read connectedly; for a work on the history of
   dogma, which is used only for reference, has missed its highest aim. I
   have believed that I could not dispense with the addition of numerous
   notes, but the text of the book is so written that the reader, if he
   prefers it, may disregard them.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

   I HAVE subjected this volume to a thorough revision, and have sought to
   improve and strengthen it in not a few places. May this new edition
   also promote the study of a historical period whose products are still
   held by many among us to be incapable of reform.

CHAPTER I.

  THE DECISIVE SUCCESS OF THEOLOGICAL SPECULATION IN THE SPHERE OF THE RULE OF
  FAITH, OR, THE DEFINING OF THE NORM OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH DUE TO THE
  ADOPTION OF THE LOGOS CHRISTOLOGY. [3]
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Introduction.

   FROM the great work of Iren√¶us and the anti-gnostic writings of
   Tertullian, it would seem as if the doctrine of the Logos, or, the
   doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ as a distinct person, was at
   the end of the second century an undisputed tenet of Church orthodoxy,
   and formed a universally recognised portion of the baptismal confession
   interpreted anti-gnostically, i.e., of the rule of faith. [4] But
   certain as it is that the Logos Christology was in the second century
   not merely the property of a few Christian philosophers, [5] it is, on
   the other hand, as clear that it did not belong to the solid structure
   of the Catholic faith. It was not on the same footing as, e.g., the
   doctrines of God the Creator, the real body of Christ, the resurrection
   of the body, etc. The great conflicts which, after c. A.D. 170, were
   waged for more than a century within the Catholic Church rather show,
   that the doctrine only gradually found its way into the creed of the
   Church. [6] But a higher than merely Christological interest attaches
   to the gradual incorporation of the Logos doctrine in the rule of
   faith. The formula of the Logos, as it was almost universally
   understood, legitimised speculation, i.e., Neo-platonic philosophy,
   within the creed of the Church. [7] When Christ was designated the
   incarnate Logos of God, and when this was set up as His supreme
   characterisation, men were directed to think of the divine in Christ as
   the reason of God realised in the structure of the world and the
   history of mankind. This implied a definite philosophical view of God,
   of creation, and of the world, and the baptismal confession became a
   compendium of scientific dogmatics, i.e., of a system of doctrine
   entwined with the Metaphysics of Plato and the Stoics. But at the same
   time an urgent impulse necessarily made itself felt to define the
   contents and value of the Redeemer's life and work, not, primarily,
   from the point of view of the proclamation of the Gospel, and the hopes
   of a future state, but from that of the cosmic significance attaching
   to his divine nature concealed in the flesh. Insomuch, however, as such
   a view could only really reach and be intelligible to those who had
   been trained in philosophical speculations, the establishing of the
   Logos Christology within the rule of faith was equivalent for the great
   mass of Christians to the setting up of a mystery, which in the first
   place could only make an impression through its high-pitched formulas
   and the glamour of the incomprehensible. But as soon as a religion
   expresses the loftiest contents of its creed in formulas which must
   remain mysterious and unintelligible to the great mass of its
   adherents, those adherents come under guardians. In other words, the
   multitude must believe in the creed; at the same time they no longer
   derive from it directly the motives of their religious and moral life;
   and they are dependent on the theologians, who, as professors of the
   mysterious, alone understand and are capable of interpreting and
   practically applying the creed. The necessary consequence of this
   development was that the mysterious creed, being no longer in a
   position practically to control life, was superseded by the authority
   of the Church, the cultus, and prescribed duties, in determining the
   religious life of the laity; while the theologians, or the priests,
   appeared alone as the possessors of an independent faith and knowledge.
   But as soon as the laity were actuated by a desire for religious
   independence, which produced a reaction, and yet was not powerful
   enough to correct the conditions out of which this state of matters
   arose, there made its appearance only an expedient of a conservative
   sort, viz., the order of the monks. As this order did not tamper with
   the prevailing system of the Church, the Church could tolerate it, and
   could even use it as a valve, by which to provide an outlet for all
   religious subjectivity, and for the energies of a piety that renounced
   the world. The history of the Church shows us, or, at any rate, lets us
   divine, this situation at the transition from the 3rd to the 4th
   century. On the one hand, we see--at least in the East--that the
   Christian faith had become a theology, which was regarded, to all
   intents without question, as the revealed faith, and only capable of
   being represented and expounded by "teachers". On the other hand, we
   find a lay Christendom tied to the priest, the cultus, the sacraments,
   and a ceremonial penitence, and revering the creed as a mystery.
   Between these arose with elemental force the order of the monks,
   which--apart from a few phenomena--did not attack the ecclesiastical
   system, and which could not be suppressed by priests and theologians,
   because it strove to realise on earth the object to which they
   themselves had subordinated the whole of theology, because it, as it
   were, sought to soar on wings to the same height, to which the steps of
   the long ladders constructed by theology were meant to conduct. [8]

   Now the incorporation in the creed of philosophic (Platonic)
   speculation, i.e., the Hellenising of the traditional doctrines, was
   not the only condition, but it was certainly one of the most important
   of the conditions, that led to the rise of this threefold Christendom
   of clergy, laity, and monks, in the Church. That the Catholic Church
   was capable of accommodating these three orders in its midst is a proof
   of its power. That the combination forms up to the present day the
   signature of Catholic Churches is evidence, moreover, of the practical
   value attached by the Church to this unified differentiation. It, in
   fact, could not but best correspond to the different wants of men
   united to form a universal Church. So far as it was a consequence of
   the general conditions under which the Church existed in the third
   century, we must here leave its origin untouched, [9] but so far as it
   was due to the reception of philosophical speculation into the Church,
   its prior history must be presented. Yet it may not be superfluous to
   begin by noticing expressly, that the confidence with which first the
   Apologists identified the Logos of the philosophers and the Christ of
   faith, and the zeal with which the anti-gnostic Fathers then
   incorporated the Logos-Christ in the creed of believers, are also to be
   explained from a Christian interest. In their scientific conception of
   the world the Logos had a fixed place, and was held to be the "alter
   ego" of God, though at the same time he was also regarded as the
   representative of the Reason that operated in the Cosmos. Their
   conception of Christ as the appearance of the Logos in a personal form
   only proves that they sought to make the highest possible assertion
   concerning him, to justify worship being rendered him, and to
   demonstrate the absolute and unique nature of the contents of the
   Christian religion. The Christian religion was only in a position to
   gain the cultured, to conquer Gnosticism, and to thrust aside
   Polytheism in the Roman empire, because it had concluded an alliance
   with that intellectual potentate which already swayed the minds and
   hearts of the best men, the philosophic-religious ethics of the age.
   This alliance found expression in the formula: Christ is word and law
   (Christo`s lo'gos kai` no'mos). The philosophic Christology arose, so
   to speak, at the circumference of the Church, and thence moved
   gradually to the centre of the Christian faith. The same is true of
   theology generally; its most concise description is philosophic
   Christology. A complete fusion of the old faith and theology, one that
   tranquillised the minds of the devout, was not consummated till the
   fourth, strictly speaking, indeed, till the fifth century (Cyril of
   Alexandria). Valentinus, Origen, the Cappadocians mark the stages of
   the process. Valentinus was very speedily ejected as a heretic. Origen,
   in spite of the immense influence which he exerted, was in the end
   unable to retain his footing in the Church. The Cappadocians almost
   perfected the complete fusion of the traditional faith of the Church
   conceived as mystery and philosophy, by removing Origen's distinction
   between those who knew and those who believed (Gnostics and Pistics);
   meanwhile they retained much that was comparatively free and looked on
   with suspicion by the traditionalists. Cyril's theology first marked
   the complete agreement between faith and philosophy, authority and
   speculation, an agreement which finally, in the sixth century,
   suppressed every independent theology. But from the end of the second
   century up to the closing years of the third, the fundamental principle
   of philosophic theology had naturalised itself, in the very faith of
   the Church. This process in which, on the one hand, certain results of
   speculative theology became legitimised within the Church as
   revelations and mysteries, and on the other--as a sort of antidote--the
   freedom of theology was limited, is to be described in what follows.

   It has been shown above (Vol. I., p. 190 ff.) that about the middle of
   the second century there existed side by side in the Churches chiefly
   two conceptions of the person of Christ. In the Adoptian view Jesus was
   regarded as the man in whom divinity or the spirit of God dwelt, and
   who was finally exalted to godlike honour. In the Pneumatic conception,
   Jesus was looked upon as a heavenly spirit who assumed an earthly body.
   The latter was adopted in their speculations by the Apologists. The
   fixing of the apostolic tradition, which took place in opposition to
   the Gnostics, as also to the so-called Montanists, in the course of the
   second half of the second century, did not yet decide in favour of
   either view. [10] The Holy Scriptures could be appealed to in support
   of both. But those had decidedly the best of it, in the circumstances
   of the time, who recognised the incarnation of a special divine nature
   in Christ; and as certainly were the others in the right, in view of
   the Synoptic gospels, who saw in Jesus the man chosen to be his Son by
   God, and possessed of the Spirit. The former conception corresponded to
   the interpretation of the O. T. theophanies which had been accepted by
   the Alexandrians, and had proved so convincing in apologetic arguments;
   [11]  it could be supported by the testimony of a series of Apostolic
   writings, whose authority was absolute; [12] it protected the O. T.
   against Gnostic criticism. It, further, reduced the highest conception
   of the value of Christianity to a brief and convincing formula: "God
   became man in order that men might become gods;" and, finally,--which
   was not least--it could be brought, with little trouble, into line with
   the cosmological and theological tenets which had been borrowed from
   the religious philosophy of the age to serve as a foundation for a
   rational Christian theology. The adoption of the belief in the divine
   Logos to explain the genesis and history of the world at once decided
   the means by which also the divine dignity and sonship of the Redeemer
   were alone to be defined. [13] In this procedure the theologians
   themselves had no danger to fear to their monotheism, even if they made
   the Logos more than a product of the creative will of God. Neither
   Justin, Tatian, nor any of the Apologists or Fathers show the slightest
   anxiety on this point. For the infinite substance, resting behind the
   world,--and as such the deity was conceived--could display and unfold
   itself in different subjects. It could impart its own inexhaustible
   being to a variety of bearers, without thereby being emptied, or its
   unity being dissolved (monarchia kat' oikonomian, as the technical
   expression has it). [14] But, lastly, the theologians had no reason to
   fear for the "deity" of the Christ in whom the incarnation of that
   Logos was to be viewed. For the conception of the Logos was capable of
   the most manifold contents, and its dexterous treatment could be
   already supported by the most instructive precedents. This conception
   could be adapted to every change and accentuation of the religious
   interest, every deepening of speculation, as as to all the needs of the
   Cultus, nay, even to new results of Biblical exegesis. It revealed
   itself gradually to be a variable quantity of the most accommodating
   kind, capable of being at once determined by any new factor received
   into the theological ferment. It even admitted contents which stood in
   the most abrupt contradiction to the processes of thought out of which
   the conception itself had sprung, i.e., contents which almost
   completely concealed the cosmological genesis of the conception. But it
   was long before this point was reached. And as long as it was not, as
   long as the Logos was still employed as the formula under which was
   comprehended either the original idea of the world, or the rational law
   of the world, many did not entirely cease to mistrust the fitness of
   the conception to establish the divinity of Christ. For those, finally,
   could not but seek to perceive the full deity in the Redeemer, who
   reckoned on a deification of man. Athanasius first made this possible
   to them by his explanation of the Logos, but he at the same time began
   to empty the conception of its original cosmological contents. And the
   history of Christology from Athanasius to Augustine is the history of
   the displacing of the Logos conception by the other, destitute of all
   cosmical contents, of the Son,--the history of the substitution of the
   immanent and absolute trinity for the economic and relative. The
   complete divinity of the Son was thereby secured, but in the form of a
   complicated and artificial speculation, which neither could be
   maintained without reservation before the tribunal of the science of
   the day, nor could claim the support of an ancient tradition.

   But the first formulated opposition to the Logos Christology did not
   spring from anxiety for the complete divinity of Christ, or even from
   solicitude for monotheism; it was rather called forth by interest in
   the evangelical, the Synoptic, idea of Christ. With this was combined
   the attack on the use of Platonic philosophy in Christian doctrine. The
   first public and literary opponents of the Christian
   Logos-speculations, therefore, did not escape the reproach of
   depreciating, if not of destroying, the dignity of the Redeemer. It was
   only in the subsequent period, in a second phase of the controversy,
   that these opponents of the Logos Christology were able to fling back
   the reproach at its defenders. With the Monarchians the first subject
   of interest was the man Jesus; then came monotheism and the divine
   dignity of Christ. From this point, however, the whole theological
   interpretation of the two first articles of the rule of faith, was
   again gradually involved in controversy. In so far as they were
   understood to refute a crude docetism and the severance of Jesus and
   Christ they were confirmed. But did not the doctrine of a heavenly √¶on,
   rendered incarnate in the Redeemer, contain another remnant of the old
   Gnostic leaven? Did not the sending forth of the Logos (probole tou
   logou) to create the world recall the emanation of the √¶ons? Was not
   ditheism set up, if two divine beings were to be worshipped? Not only
   were the uncultured Christian laity driven to such criticisms, -- for
   what did they understand by the "economic mode of the existence of
   God"? -- but also all those theologians who refused to give any place
   to Platonic philosophy in Christian dogmatics. A conflict began which
   lasted for more than a century, in certain branches of it for almost
   two centuries. Who opened it, or first assumed the aggressive, we know
   not. The contest engages our deepest interest in different respects,
   and can be described from different points of view. We cannot regard
   it, indeed, directly as a fight waged by theology against a still
   enthusiastic conception of religion; for the literary opponents of the
   Logos Christology were no longer enthusiasts, but, rather, from the
   very beginning their declared enemies. Nor was it directly a war of the
   theologians against the laity, for it was not laymen, but only
   theologians who had adopted the creed of the laity, who opposed their
   brethren. [15] We must describe it as the strenuous effort of Stoic
   Platonism to obtain supremacy in the theology of the Church; the
   victory of Plato over Zeno and Aristotle in Christian science; the
   history of the displacement of the historical by the pre-existent
   Christ, of the Christ of reality by the Christ of thought, in
   dogmatics; finally, as the victorious attempt to substitute the mystery
   of the person of Christ for the person Himself, and, by means of a
   theological formula unintelligible to them, to put the laity with their
   Christian faith under guardians -- a state desired and indeed required
   by them to an increasing extent. When the Logos Christology obtained a
   complete victory, the traditional view of the Supreme deity as one
   person, and, along with this, every thought of the real and complete
   human personality of the Redeemer was in fact condemned as being
   intolerable in the Church. Its place was taken by "the nature" [of
   Christ], which without "the person" is simply a cipher. The defeated
   party had right on its side, but had not succeeded in making its
   Christology agree with its conception of the object and result of the
   Christian religion. This was the very reason of its defeat. A religion
   which promised its adherents that their nature would be rendered
   divine, could only be satisfied by a redeemer who in his own person had
   deified human nature. If, after the gradual fading away of
   eschatological hopes, the above prospect was held valid, then those
   were right who worked out this view of the Redeemer.

   In accordance with an expression coined by Tertullian, we understand by
   Monarchians the representatives of strict, not economic, monotheism in
   the ancient Church. In other words, they were theologians who held
   firmly by the dignity of Jesus as Redeemer, but at the same time would
   not give up the personal, the numerical, unity of God; and who
   therefore opposed the speculations which had led to the adoption of the
   duality or trinity of the godhead. [16] In order rightly to understand
   their position in the history of the genesis of the dogmatics of the
   Church, it is decisive, as will have been already clear from the above,
   that they only came to the front, after the anti-gnostic understanding
   of the baptismal confession had been substantially assured in the
   Church. It results from this that they are, generally speaking, to be
   criticised as men who appeared on the soil of Catholicism, and that
   therefore, apart from the points clearly in dispute, we must suppose
   agreement between them and their opponents. It is not superfluous to
   recall this expressly. The confusion to which the failure to note this
   presupposition has led and still continually leads may be seen, e.g.,
   in the relative section in Dorner's History of the development of the
   doctrine' of the Person of Christ, or in Krawutzcky's study on the
   origin of the Didache. [17] The so-called Dynamistic Monarchians have
   had especially to suffer from this criticism, their teaching being
   comfortably disposed of as "Ebionitic". However, imperative as it
   certainly is, in general, to describe the history of Monarchianism
   without reference to the ancient pre-Catholic controversies, and only
   to bring in the history of Montanism with great caution, still many
   facts observed in reference to the earliest bodies of Monarchians that
   come clearly before us, seem to prove that they bore features which
   must be characterised as pre-Catholic, but not un-Catholic. This is
   especially true of their attitude to certain books of the New
   Testament. Undoubtedly we have reason even here to complain of the
   scantiness and uncertainty of our historical material. The Church
   historians have attempted to bury or distort the true history of
   Monarchianism to as great an extent as they passed over and obscured
   that of the so-called Montanism. At a very early date, if not in the
   first stages of the controversy, they read Ebionitism and Gnosticism
   into the theses of their opponents; they attempted to discredit their
   theological works as products of a specific secularisation, or as
   travesties, of Christianity, and they sought to portray the Monarchians
   themselves as renegades who had abandoned the rule of faith and the
   Canon. By this kind of polemics they have made it difficult for after
   ages to decide, among other things, whether certain peculiarities of
   Monarchian bodies in dealing with the Canon of the N. T. writings
   spring from a period when there was as yet no N. T. Canon in the strict
   Catholic sense, or whether these characteristics are to be regarded as
   deviations from an already settled authority, and therefore
   innovations. Meanwhile, looking to the Catholicity of the whole
   character of Monarchian movements, and, further, to the fact that no
   opposition is recorded as having been made by them to the N. T. Canon
   after its essential contents and authority appear to have been
   established; considering, finally, that the Montanists, and even the
   Marcionites and Gnostics, were very early charged with attempts on the
   Catholic Canon, we need no longer doubt that the Monarchian deviations
   point exclusively to a time when no such Canon existed; and that other
   "heresies", to be met with in the older groups, are to be criticised on
   the understanding that the Church was becoming, but not yet become,
   Catholic. [18]

   The history of Monarchianism is no clearer than its rise in the form of
   particular theological tendencies. Here also we have before us, at the
   present day, only scanty fragments. We cannot always trace completely
   even the settled distinction between Dynamistic -- better, Adoptian --
   and Modalistic Monarchianism; [19] between the theory that made the
   power or Spirit of God dwell in the man Jesus, and the view that sees
   in Him the incarnation of the deity Himself. [20]

   Certainly the common element, so far as there was one, of the
   Monarchian movements, lay in the form of the conception of God, the
   distinguishing feature, in the idea of revelation. But all the
   phenomena under this head cannot be classified with certainty, apart
   from the fact that the most numerous and important "systems" exist in a
   very shaky tradition. A really reliable division of the Monarchianism
   that in all its forms rejected the idea of a physical fatherhood of
   God, and only saw the Son of God in the historical Jesus, is impossible
   on the strength of the authorities up till now known to us. Apart from
   a fragment or two we only possess accounts by opponents. The
   chronology, again, causes a special difficulty. Much labour has been
   spent upon it since the discovery of the Philosophumena; but most of
   the details have remained very uncertain. The dates of the Alogi,
   Artemas, Praxeas, Sabellius, the Antiochian Synods against Paul of
   Samosata, etc., have not yet been firmly settled. The concise remarks
   on the subject in what follows rest on independent labours. Finally, we
   are badly informed even as to the geographical range of the
   controversies. We may, however, suppose, with great probability, that
   at one time or other a conflict took place in all centres of
   Christianity in the Empire. But a connected history cannot be given.

   Adv. Prax. 2. In the rule of faith, De virg., vel. I, there is no
   statement as to the pre-existence of the Son of God.

   [5] See Vol. I., p. 192, Note (John's Gospel, Revelation, Ke'rugma
   Pe'trou, Ignatius, and esp. Celsus in Orig. II. 31, etc.).

   [6] The observation that Iren√¶us and Tertullian treat it as a fixed
   portion of the rule of faith is very instructive; for it shows that
   these theologians were ahead of the Church of their time. Here we have
   a point given, at which we can estimate the relation of what Iren√¶us
   maintained to be the creed of the Church, to the doctrine which was, as
   a matter of fact, generally held at the time in the Church. We may turn
   this insight to account for the history of the Canon and the
   constitution, where, unfortunately, an estimate of the statements of
   Iren√¶us is rendered difficult.

   [7] By Neo-platonic philosophy we, of course, do not here mean
   Neo-platonism, but the philosophy (in method and also in part, in
   results), developed before Neoplatonism by Philo, Valentinus, Numenius,
   and others.

   [8] See my lecture on Monachism, 3rd ed. 1886.

   [9] Yet see Vol. II., pp. 122-127.

   [10] The points, which, as regards Christ, belonged in the second half
   of the second century to ecclesiastical orthodoxy, are given in the
   clauses of the Roman baptismal confession to which alethos is added, in
   the precise elaboration of the idea of creation, in the heis placed
   alongside Christo`s Iesous, and in the identification of the Catholic
   institution of the Church with the Holy Church.

   [11] The Christian doctrine of the Son of God could be most easily
   rendered acceptable to cultured heathens by means of the Logos
   doctrine; see the memorable confession of Celsus placed by him in the
   lips of his "Jew" (II. 31); hos eige ho logos estin humin huios tou
   Theou, kai hemeis epainoumen; see also the preceeding: sophizontai hoi
   Christianoi en to legein ton huion tou Theou einai autologon.

   [12] The conviction of the harmony of the Apostles, or, of all
   Apostolic writings, could not but result in the Christology of the
   Synoptics and the Acts being interpreted in the light of John and Paul,
   or more accurately, in that of the philosophic Christology held to be
   attested by John and Paul. It has been up to the present day the usual
   fate of the Synoptics, and with them of the sayings of Jesus, to be
   understood, on account of their place in the Canon, in accordance with
   the caprices of the dogmatics prevalent at the time, Pauline and
   Johannine theology having assigned to it the role of mediator. The
   "lower" had to be explained by the "higher" (see even Clemens Alex.
   with his criticism of the "pneumatic", the spiritual, Fourth Gospel, as
   compared with the first three). In older times men transformed the
   sense right off; nowadays they speak of steps which lead to the higher
   teaching, and the dress the old illusion with a new scientific mantle.

   [13] But the substitution of the Logos for the, otherwise undefined,
   spiritual being (pneuma) in Christ presented another very great
   advantage. It brought to an end, though not at once (see Clemens
   Alex.), the speculations which reckoned the heavenly personality of
   Christ in some way or other in the number of the higher angels or
   conceived it as one √Üon among many. Through the definition of this
   "Spiritual Being" as Logos his transcendent and unique dignity was
   firmly outlined and assured. For the Logos was universally accepted as
   the Prius logically and temporally, and the causa not only of the
   world, but also of all powers, ideas, √¶ons, and angels. He, therefore,
   did not belong--at least in every respect--to their order.

   [14] Augustine first wrought to end this questionable monotheism, and
   endeavoured to treat seriously the monotheism of the living God. But
   his efforts only produced an impression in the West, and even there the
   attempt was weakened from the start by a faulty respect for the
   prevalent Christology, and was forced to entangle itself in absurd
   formulas. In the East the accommodating Substance-Monotheism of
   philosophy remained with its permission of a plurality of divine
   persons; and this doctrine was taught with such na√Øvety and simplicity,
   that the Cappadocians, e.g., proclaimed the Christian conception of God
   to be the just mean between the polytheism of the heathens and the
   monotheism of the Jews.

   [15] The Alogi opposed the Montanists and all prophecy; conversely the
   western representatives of the Logos Christology, Iren√¶us, Tertullian
   and Hippolytus were Chiliasts. But this feature makes no change in the
   fact that the incorporation of the Logos Christology and the fading
   away of eschatological apocalyptic hopes went hand in hand. Theologians
   were able to combine inconsistent beliefs for a time; but for the great
   mass of the laity in the East the mystery of the person of Christ took
   the place of the Christ who was to have set up his visible Kingdom of
   glory upon earth. See especially the refutation of the Chiliasts by
   Origen (peri arch. II. II) and Dionysius Alex. (Euseb. H. E. VII. 24,
   25). The continued embodiment in new visions of those eschatological
   hopes and apocalyptic fancies by the monks and laymen of later times,
   proved that the latter could not make the received mystery of dogma
   fruitful for their practical religion.

   [16] This definition is, in truth, too narrow; for at least a section,
   if not all, of the so-called Dynamistic Monarchians recognised, besides
   God, the Spirit as eternal Son of God, and accordingly assumed two
   Hypostases. But they did not see in Jesus an incarnation of this Holy
   Spirit, and they were therefore monarchian in their doctrine of Christ.
   Besides, so far as I know, the name of Monarchians was not applied in
   the ancient Church to these, but only to the theologians who taught
   that there was in Christ an incarnation of God the Father Himself. It
   was not extended to the earlier Dynamistic Monarchians, because, so far
   as we know, the question whether God consisted of one or more persons
   did not enter into the dispute with them. In a wider sense, the
   Monarchians could be taken also to include the Arians, and all those
   theologians, who, while they recognised the personal independence of a
   divine nature in Christ, yet held this nature to have been one created
   by God; in any case, the Arians were undoubtedly connected with Paul of
   Samosata through Lucian. However, it is not advisable to extend the
   conception so widely; for, firstly, we would thus get too far away from
   the old classification, and, secondly, it is not to be overlooked that,
   even in the case of the most thoroughgoing Arians, their Christology
   reacted on their doctrine of God, and their strict Monotheism was to
   some extent modified. Hence, both on historical and logical grounds, it
   is best for our purpose to understand by Monarchians those theologians
   exclusively who perceived in Jesus either a man filled, in a unique
   way, with the Spirit, or an incarnation of God the Father; with the
   reservation, that the former in certain of their groups regarded the
   Holy Spirit as a divine Hypostasis, and were accordingly no longer
   really Monarchians in the strict sense of the term. For the rest, the
   expression "Monarchians" is in so far inappropriate as their opponents
   would also have certainly maintained the "monarchia" of God. See
   Tertulli., Adv. Prax. 3 f.; Epiphan. H. 62. 3: ou polutheian
   eisegoumetha, alla monarchian keruttomen. They would even have cast
   back at the Monarchians the reproach that they were destroying the
   monarchy. "He monarchia tou Theou" was in the second century a standing
   title in the polemics of the theologians against polytheists and
   Gnostics -- see the passages collected from Justin, Tatian, Iren√¶us
   etc. by Coustant in his Ep. Dionysii adv. Sabell. (Routh, Reliq. Sacr√¶
   III., p. 385 f.). Tertullian has therefore by no means used the term
   "Monarchians" as if he were thus directly branding his opponents as
   heretical; he rather names them by their favourite catch-word in a
   spirit of irony (Adv. Prax. 10; "vanissimi Monarchiani"). The name was
   therefore not really synonymous with a form of heresy in the ancient
   Church, even if here and there it was applied to the opponents of the
   doctrine of the Trinity.

   [17] See Theol. Quartalschr. 1884, p. 547 ff. Krawutzcky holds the
   Didache to be at once Ebionitic and Theodotian.

   [18] It is very remarkable that Iren√¶us has given us no hint in his
   great work of a Monarchian controversy in the Church.

   [19] It was pointed out above, (Vol. I., p. 193) and will be argued
   more fully later on, that the different Christologies could pass into
   one another.

   [20] We have already noticed, Vol. I., p. 195, that we can only speak
   of a na√Øve Modalism in the earlier periods; Modalism first appeared as
   an exclusive doctrine at the close of the second century; see under.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. The Secession of Dynamistic Monarchianism or Adoptianism.

   (a). The so-called Alogi in Asia Minor. [21]

   Epiphanius [22] and Philastrius (H. 60) know, from the Syntagma of
   Hippolytus, of a party to which the latter had given the nickname of
   "Alogi". Hippolytus had recorded that its members rejected the Gospel
   and the Apocalypse of John, [23] attributing these books to Cerinthus,
   and had not recognised the Logos of God to whom the Holy Spirit had
   borne witness in the Gospel. Hippolytus, the most prolific of the
   opponents of the heretics, wrote, besides his Syntagma, a special work
   against these men in defence of the Johannine writings; [24] and he
   perhaps also attacked them in another work aimed at all Monarchians.
   [25] The character of the party can still be defined, in its main
   features, from the passages taken by Epiphanius from these writings,
   due regard being given to Iren√¶us III. 11, 9. The Christological
   problem seems not to have occupied a foremost place in the discussion,
   but rather, the elimination of all docetic leaven, and the attitude to
   prophecy. The non-descript, the Alogi, were a party of the radical,
   anti-montanist, opposition in Asia Minor, existing within the Church --
   so radical that they refused to recognise the Montanist communities as
   Christian. They wished to have all prophecy kept out of the Church; in
   this sense they were decided contemners of the Spirit (Iren. l.c.;
   Epiph. 51, ch. 35). This attitude led them to an historical criticism
   of the two Johannine books, the one of which contained Christ's
   announcement of the Paraclete, a passage which Montanus had made the
   most of for his own ends, while the other imparted prophetic
   revelations. They came to the conclusion, on internal grounds, that
   these books could not be genuine, that they were composed "in the name
   of John" (eis onoa Ioannou ch. 3, 18), and that by Cerinthus (ch. 3,
   4,); the books ought not therefore to be received in the Church (ch. 3:
   ouk axia auta phasin einai en ekklesia). The Gospel was charged with
   containing what was untrue; it contradicted the other Gospels, [26] and
   gave a quite different and, indeed, a notoriously false order of
   events; it was devoid of any sort of arrangement; it omitted important
   facts and inserted new ones which were inconsistent with the Synoptic
   Gospels; and it was docetic. [27] Against the Apocalypse it was
   alleged, above all, that its contents were often unintelligible, nay,
   absurd and untrue (ch. 32-34). They ridiculed the seven angels and
   seven trumpets, and the four angels by the Euphrates; and on Rev. II.
   18, they supposed that there was no Christian community in Thyatira at
   the time, and that accordingly the Epistle was fictitious. Moreover,
   the objections to the Gospel must also have included the charge (ch.
   18) that it favoured Docetism, seeing that it passed at once from the
   incarnation of the Logos to the work of the ministry of Christ. In this
   connection they attacked the expression "Logos" for the Son of God;
   [28] indeed, they scented Gnosticism in it, contrasted John I. with the
   beginning of Mark's Gospel, [29] and arrived at the result, that
   writings whose contents were partly docetic, partly sensuously Jewish
   and unworthy of God, must have been composed by Cerinthus, the
   gnosticising Judaist. In view of this fact it is extremely surprising
   to notice how mildly the party was criticised and treated by Iren√¶us as
   well as by Hippolytus. The former distinguishes them sharply from the
   declared heretics. He places them on a line with the Schismatics, who
   gave up communion with the Church on account of the hypocrites to be
   found in it. He approves of their decided opposition to all
   pseudo-prophetic nonsense, and he only complains that in their zeal
   against the bad they had also fought against the good, and had sought
   to eject all prophecy. In short, he feels that between them and the
   Montanists, whom likewise he did not look on as heretics, [30] he held
   the middle position maintained by the Church. And so with Hippolytus.
   The latter, apart from features which he could not but blame, confirms
   the conformity to the Church, claimed by the party itself (ch. 3), and
   conspicuous in their insistence on the harmony of the Scriptures
   (sumphoni'a ton biblon). [31] He nowhere sets them on a line with
   Cerinthus, Ebion, etc., and he has undoubtedly treated even their
   Christological views, on which Iren√¶us had communicated no information,
   more mildly, because he found so much in them of an anti-docetic,
   anti-montanistic nature, with which he could agree. But what was their
   teaching as to Christ? If Lipsius [32] were correct in his opinion that
   the Alogi only saw in Jesus a man naturally procreated, that they only
   pretended to hold by the current doctrine, then the attitude to them of
   Iren√¶us and Hippolytus would be incomprehensible. But our authority
   gives no support to such a view. It rather shows plainly that the Alogi
   recognised the first three Gospels, and consequently the miraculous
   birth from the Holy Ghost and the virgin. They placed, however, the
   chief emphasis on the human life of Jesus, on his birth, baptism, and
   temptation as told by the Synoptics, and for this very reason rejected
   the formula of the Logos, as well as the "birth from above", i.e., the
   eternal generation of Christ. The equipment of Christ at his baptism
   was to them, in view of Mark, ch. I., of crucial importance (see p. 16,
   Note 4) and thus they would assume, without themselves making use of
   the phrase "a mere man" "(psilo`s anthropos), an advancement (prokope)
   of the Christ, ordained at his baptism to be Son of God. [33]

   The earliest opponents known to us of the Logos Christology were men
   whose adherence to the position of the Church in Asia Minor was
   strongly marked. This attitude of theirs was exhibited in a decided
   antagonism both to the Gnosticism, say, of Cerinthus, and to
   "Kataphrygian" prophecy. In their hostility to the latter they
   anticipated the development of the Church by about a generation; while
   rejecting all prophecy and "gifts of the Spirit" (ch.35), they, in
   doing so, gave the clearest revelation of their Catholic character.
   Since they did not believe in an age of the Paraclete, nor entertain
   materialistic hopes about the future state, they could not reconcile
   themselves to the Johannine writings; and their attachment to the
   conception of Christ in the Synoptics led them to reject the Gospel of
   the Logos. An explicitly Church party could not have ventured to
   promulgate such views, if they had been confronted by a Canon already
   closed, and giving a fixed place to these Johannine books. The
   uncompromising criticism, both internal and external -- as in the
   hypothesis of the Cerinthian authorship -- to which these were
   subjected, proves that, when the party arose, no Catholic Canon existed
   as yet in Asia Minor, and that, accordingly, the movement was almost as
   ancient that of the Montanists, which it followed very closely. [34] On
   this understanding, the party had a legitimate place within the
   developing Catholic Church, and only so can we explain the criticism
   which their writings encountered in the period immediately succeeding.
   Meanwhile, the first express opposition with which we are acquainted to
   the Logos Christology was raised within the Church, by a party which,
   yet, must be conceived by us to have been in many respects specifically
   secularised. For the radical opposition to Montanism, and the open, and
   at the same time jesting, criticism on the Apocalypse, [35] can only be
   so regarded. Yet the preference of the Logos Christology to others is
   itself indeed, as Celsus teaches, a symptom of secularisation and
   innovation in the creed. The Alogi attacked it on this ground when they
   took it as promoting Gnosticism (Docetism). But they also tried to
   refute the Logos Doctrine and the Logos Gospel on historical grounds,
   by a reference to the Synoptic Gospels. The representatives of this
   movement were, as far as we know, the first to undertake within the
   Church a historical criticism, worth of the name, of the Christian
   Scriptures and the Church tradition. They first confronted John's
   Gospel with the Synoptics, and found numerous contradictions;
   Epiphanius, -- and probably, before him, Hippolytus, -- called them,
   therefore, word-hunters (lexitherountes H. 51, ch. 34). They and their
   opponents could retort on each other the charge of introducing
   innovations; but we cannot mistake the fact that the larger proportion
   of innovations is to be looked for on the side of the Alogi. How long
   the latter held their ground; how, when, and by whom they were expelled
   from the Church in Asia Minor, we do not know.

   (b). The Roman Adoptians. -- Theodotus the leather-worker and his
   party: Asclepiodotus, Hermophilus, Apollonides, Theodotus the
   money-changer, and also the Artemonites. [36]

   Towards the end of the episcopate of Eleutherus, or at the beginning of
   that of Victor (¬± 190) there came from Byzantium to Rome the
   leather-worker Theodotus, who afterwards was characterised as the
   "founder, leader, and father of the God-denying revolt", i.e., of
   Adoptianism. Hippolytus calls him a "rag" (apospasma) of the Alogi, and
   it is in fact not improbable that he came from the circle of those
   theologians of Asia Minor. Stress is laid on his unusual culture; "he
   was supreme in Greek culture, very learned in science" (en paideia
   Hellenike akros, polumathes tou logou); and he was, therefore, highly
   respected in his native city. All we know for certain of his history is
   that he was excommunicated by the Roman Bishop, Victor, on account of
   the Christology which he taught in Rome (Euseb. V. 28. 6: apekeruxe tes
   koinonias); his is, therefore, the first case of which we are certain,
   where a Christian who took his stand on the rule of faith was yet
   treated as a heretic. [37] As regards his teaching, the Philosophumena
   expressly testify to the orthodoxy of Theodotus in his theology and
   cosmology. [38] In reference to the Person of Christ he taught: that
   Jesus was a man, who, by a special decree of God, was born of a virgin
   through the operation of the Holy Spirit; but that we were not to see
   in him a heavenly being, who had assumed flesh in the virgin. After the
   piety of his life had been thoroughly tested, the Holy Ghost descended
   upon him in baptism; by this means he became Christ and received his
   equipment (dunameis) for his special vocation; and he demonstrated the
   righteousness, in virtue of which he excelled all men, and was, of
   necessity, their authority. Yet the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus
   was not sufficient to justify the contention that he was now "God".
   Some of the followers of Theodotus represented Jesus as having become
   God through the resurrection; others disputed even this. [39] This
   Christology, Theodotus and his party sought to prove from Scripture.
   Philaster says in general terms: "they use the chapters of Scripture
   which tell of Christ as man, but they avoid those which speak of him as
   God, reading and by no means understanding" (Utuntur capitulis
   scripturarum qu√¶ de Christo veluti de homine edocent, qu√¶ autem ut deo
   dicunt ea vero non accipiunt, legentes et nullo modo intellegentes).
   Epiphanius has, fortunately, preserved for us fragments of the biblical
   theological investigations of Theodotus, by the help of the Syntagma.
   These show that there was no longer any dispute as to the extent of the
   N. T. Canon; the Gospel of John is recognised, and in this respect also
   Theodotus is Catholic. The investigations are interesting, however,
   because they are worked out by the same prosaic methods of exegesis,
   adopted in the above discussed works of the Alogi. [40]

   Theodotus' form of teaching was, even in the life-time of its author,
   held in Rome to be intolerable, and that by men disposed to Modalism --
   e.g., the Bishop himself, see under -- as well as by the
   representatives of the Logos Christology. It is certain that he was
   excommunicated by Victor, accordingly before A.D. 199, on the charge of
   teaching that Christ was "mere man" (psilos anthropos). We do not know
   how large his following was in the city. We cannot put it at a high
   figure, since in that case the Bishop would not have ventured on
   excommunication. It must, however, have been large enough to allow of
   the experiment of forming an independent Church. This was attempted in
   the time of the Roman Bishop Zephyrine (199-218) by the most important
   of the disciples of Theodotus, viz., Theodotus the money changer, and a
   certain Asclepiodotus. It is extremely probable that both of these men
   were also Greeks. A native, Natalius the confessor, was induced, so we
   are told by the Little Labyrinth, to become Bishop of the party, at a
   salary of 150 denarii a month. The attempt failed. The oppressed Bishop
   soon deserted and returned into the bosom of the great Church. It was
   told that he had been persuaded by visions and finally by blows with
   which "holy angels" pursued him during the night. The above undertaking
   is interesting in itself, since it proves how great had already become
   the gulf between the Church and these Monarchians in Rome, about A.D.
   210; but still more instructive is the sketch given of the leaders of
   the party by the Little Labyrinth, a sketch that agrees excellently
   with the accounts given of the lexitherountes' in Asia, and of the
   exegetic labours of the older Theodotus. [41] The offence charged
   against the Theodotians was threefold: the grammatical and formal
   exegesis of Holy Scripture, the trenchant textual criticism, and the
   thorough-going study of Logic, Mathematics, and the empirical sciences.
   It would seem at a first glance as if these men were no longer as a
   rule interested in theology. But the opposite was the case. Their
   opponent had himself to testify that they pursued grammatical exegesis
   "in order to prove their godless tenets," textual criticism in order to
   correct the manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures, and philosophy "in
   order by the science of unbelievers to support their heretical
   conception." He had also to bear witness to the fact that these
   scholars had not tampered with the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures,
   or the extent of the Canon (V. 28. 18). [42] Their whole work,
   therefore, was in the service of their theology. But the method of this
   work, -- and we can infer it to have been also that of the Alogi and
   the older Theodotus -- conflicted with the dominant theological method.
   Instead of Plato and Zeno, the Adoptians revered the Empiricists;
   instead of the allegorical interpretation of Scripture, the grammatical
   was alone held to be valid; instead of simply accepting or capriciously
   trimming the traditional text, an attempt was made to discover the
   original. [43] How unique and valuable is this information! How
   instructive it is to observe that this method struck the disciple of
   the Apologists and Iren√¶us as strange, nay, even as heretical, that
   while he would have seen nothing to object to in the study of Plato, he
   was seized with horror at the idea of Aristotle, Euclid, and Galen,
   being put in the place of Plato! The difference was, indeed, not merely
   one of method. In the condition of the theology of the Church at that
   time, it could not be supposed that religious conviction was especially
   strong or ardent in men who depreciated the religious philosophy of the
   Greeks. For whence, if not from this source, or from Apocalyptics, did
   men then derive a distinctively pious enthusiasm? [44] It is also
   little to be wondered at that the attempt made by these scholars to
   found a Church in Rome, was so quickly wrecked. They were fated to
   remain officers without an army; for with grammar, textual criticism,
   and logic one could only throw discredit, in the communities, on the
   form of Christological doctrine which held the highest place and had
   been rendered venerable by long tradition. These scholars, therefore,
   although they regarded themselves as Catholic, stood outside the
   Church. [45] Of the works of these, the earliest exegetical scholars,
   nothing has come down to us. [46] They have gone without leaving any
   appreciable effect on the Church. Contrast the significance gained by
   the schools of Alexandria and Antioch! The latter, which rose about 60
   years later, took up again the work of this Roman school. It, too, came
   to stand outside the great Church; but it brought about one of the most
   important crises in the dogmatics of the Church, because in its
   philosophico-theological starting-point it was at one with orthodoxy.

   The methodical and exegetical examination of the Holy Scriptures
   confirmed the Theodotians in their conception of Christ as the man in
   whom in an especial manner the Spirit of God had operated, and had made
   them opponents of the Logos Christology. The author of the Little
   Labyrinth does not state wherein the doctrine of the younger Theodotus
   differed from that of the older. When he says that some of the
   Theodotians rejected the law and the prophets propha'sei cha'ritos, we
   may well suppose that they simply emphasised -- in a Pauline sense, or
   because of considerations drawn from a historical study of religion --
   the relativity of the authority of the O. T.; [47] for there is as
   little known of any rejection of the Catholic Canon on the part of the
   Theodotians, as of a departure from the rule of faith. Now Hippolytus
   has extracted from the exegetical works of the younger Theodotus one
   passage, the discussion of Hebr. V. 6, 10; VI. 20 f.; VII. 3, 17; and
   out of this he has made an important heresy. Later historians eagerly
   seized on this; they ascribed to the younger Theodotus, as
   distinguished from the older, a cultus of Melchizedek and invented a
   sect of Melchizedekians (= Theodotians). The moneychanger taught, it
   was said (Epiph. H. 55), that Melchizedek was a very great power, and
   more exalted than Christ, the latter being merely related to the former
   as the copy to the original. Melchizedek was the advocate of the
   heavenly powers before God, and the High Priest among men, [48] while
   Jesus as priest stood a degree lower. The origin of the former was
   completely concealed, because it was heavenly, but Jesus was born of
   Mary. To this Epiphanius adds that the party presented its oblations in
   the name of M. (eis onoma tou Melchisede'k); for he was the guide to
   God, the prince of righteousness, the true Son of God. It is apparent
   that the Theodotians cannot have taught this simply as it stands. The
   explanation is not far to seek. There was a wide-spread opinion in the
   whole ancient Church, that Melchizedek was a manifestation of the true
   Son of God; and to this view many speculations attached themselves,
   here and there in connection with a subordinationist Christology. [49]
   The Theodotians shared this conception. Immediately after the sentence
   given above Epiphanius has (55, c. 8): And Christ, they say, was chosen
   that he might call us from many ways to this one knowledge, having been
   anointed by God, and chosen, when he turned us from idols and showed us
   the way. And the Apostle having been sent by him revealed to us that
   Melchizedek is great and remains a priest for ever, and behold how
   great he is; and because the less is blessed by the greater, therefore
   he says that he as being greater blessed Abraham the patriarch; of whom
   we are initiated that we may obtain from him the blessing. [50]

   Now the Christological conception, formulated in the first half of this
   paragraph, was certainly not reported from an opponent. It is precisely
   that of the Shepherd, [51] and accordingly very ancient in the Roman
   Church. [52] From this, and by a reference to the controversial writing
   of Hippolytus (Epiph. l.c. ch. 9), the "heretical" cultus of
   Melchizedek is explained. These Theodotians maintained, as is also
   shown by their exegesis on 1 Cor. VIII. 6, [53] three points: First,
   that besides the Father the only divine being was the Holy Spirit, who
   was identical with the Son -- again simply the position of Hermas;
   secondly, that this Holy Spirit appeared to Abraham in the form of the
   King of Righteousness -- and this, as has been shown above, was no
   novel contention; thirdly, that Jesus was a man anointed with the power
   of the Holy Ghost. But, in that case, it was only logical, and in
   itself not uncatholic, to teach that offerings and worship were due, as
   to the true, eternal Son of God, to this King of Righteousness who had
   appeared to Abraham, and had blessed him and his real descendants,
   i.e., the Christians. And if, in comparison with this Son of God; the
   chosen and anointed servant of God, Jesus, appears inferior at first,
   precisely in so far as he is man, yet their position was no more
   unfavourable in this respect than that of Hermas. For Hermas also
   taught that Jesus, being only the adopted Son of God, was really not to
   be compared to the Holy Spirit, the Eternal Son; or, rather, he is
   related to the latter, to use a Theodotian expression, as the copy to
   the original. Yet there is undoubtedly a great distinction between the
   Theodotians and Hermas. They unmistakably used their speculations as to
   the eternal Son of God in order to rise to that Son from the man Jesus
   of history, and to transcend the historical in general as something
   subordinate. [54] There is not a word of this to be found in Hermas.
   Thus, the Theodotians sought, in a similar way to Origen, to rid
   themselves by speculation of what was merely historical, setting, like
   him, the eternal Son of God above the Crucified One. We have evidence
   of the correctness of this opinion in the observation that these
   speculations on Melchizedek were continued precisely in the school of
   Origen. We find them, and that with the same tendency to depreciate the
   historical Son of God, in Hieracas and the confederacy of Hieracite
   monks; [55] as also in the monks who held the views of Origen in Egypt
   in the fourth and fifth centuries.

   We have accordingly found that these theologians retained the ancient
   Roman Christology represented by Hermas; but that they edited it
   theologically and consequently changed its intention. If, at that time,
   the "Pastor" was still read in the Roman Church, while the Theodotian
   Christology was condemned, then its Christology must have been
   differently interpreted. In view of the peculiar character of the book,
   this would not be difficult. We may ask, however, whether the teaching
   of the Theodotians is really to be characterised as Monarchian, seeing
   that they assigned a special, and as it seems, an independent role to
   the Holy Spirit apart from God. Meanwhile, we can no longer determine
   how these theologians reconciled the separate substance (hypostasis) of
   the Holy Ghost, with the unity of the Person of God. But so much is
   certain, that in their Christology the Spirit was considered by them
   only as a power, and that, on the other hand, their rejection of the
   Logos Christology was not due to any repugnance to the idea of a second
   divine being. This is proved by their teaching as to the Holy Spirit
   and His appearance in the Old Testament. But then the difference
   between them and their opponents does not belong to the sphere of the
   doctrine of God; they are rather substantially at one on this subject
   with a theologian like Hippolytus. If that is so, however, their
   opponents were undoubtedly superior to them, while they themselves fell
   short of the traditional estimate of Christ. In other words, if there
   was an eternal Son of God, or any one of that nature, and if He
   appeared under the old covenant, then the traditional estimate of Jesus
   could not be maintained, once he was separated from that Son. [56] The
   formula of the man anointed with the Spirit was no longer sufficient to
   establish the transcendent greatness of the revelation of God in
   Christ, and it is only a natural consequence that the O. T. theophanies
   should appear in a brighter light. We see here why the old
   Christological conceptions passed away so quickly, comparatively
   speaking, and gave place so soon in the Churches to the complete and
   essential elevation of Jesus to the rank of deity, whenever theological
   reflection awoke to life. It was, above all, the distinctive method of
   viewing the Old Testament and its theophanies that led to this.

   In certain respects the attempt of the Theodotians presents itself as
   an innovation. They sought to raise a once accepted, but, so to speak,
   enthusiastic form of faith to the stage of theology and to defend it as
   the only right one; they expressly refused, or, at least, declared to
   be matter of controversy, the use of the title "God" (Theos) as applied
   to Jesus; they advanced beyond Jesus to an eternal, unchangeable Being
   (beside God). In this sense, in consequence of the new interest which
   the representatives of the above doctrine took in the old formula, it
   is to be regarded as novel. For we can hardly attribute to pre-catholic
   Christians like Hermas, a special interest in the essential humanity of
   Jesus. They certainly believed that they gave full expression in their
   formulas to the highest possible estimate of the Redeemer; they had no
   other idea. These theologians, on the other hand, defended a lower
   conception of Christ against a higher. Thus we may judge them on their
   own ground; for they let the idea of a heavenly Son of God stand, and
   did not carry out the complete revision of the prevailing doctrine that
   would have justified them in proving their Christological conception to
   be the one really legitimate and satisfactory. They indeed supported it
   by Scriptural proof, and in this certainly surpassed their opponents,
   but the proof did not cover the gaps in their dogmatic procedure. Since
   they took their stand on the regula fidei, it is unjust and at the same
   time unhistorical to call their form of doctrine "Ebionitic", or to
   dispose of them with the phrase that Christ was to them exclusively a
   mere man (psilos anthrotos). But if we consider the circumstances in
   which they appeared, and the excessive expectations that were pretty
   generally attached to the possession of faith -- above all, the
   prospect of the future deification of every believer -- we cannot avoid
   the impression, that a doctrine could not but be held to be
   destructive, which did not even elevate Christ to divine honours, or,
   at most, assigned him an apotheosis, like that imagined by the heathens
   for their emperors or an Antinous. Apocalyptic enthusiasm passed
   gradually into Neo-platonic mysticism. In this transition these
   scholars took no share. They rather sought to separate a part of the
   old conceptions, and to defend that with the scientific means of their
   opponents.

   Once more, 20 to 30 years later, the attempt was made in Rome by a
   certain Artemas to rejuvenate the old Christology. We are extremely ill
   informed as to this last phase of Roman Adoptianism; for the extracts
   taken by Eusebius from the Little Labyrinth, the work written against
   Artemas and his party, apply almost exclusively to the Theodotians. We
   learn, however, that the party appealed to the historical justification
   of their teaching in Rome, maintaining that Bishop Zephyrine had first
   falsified the true doctrine which they defended. [57] The relative
   correctness of this contention is indisputable, especially if we
   consider that Zephyrine had not disapproved of the formula, certainly
   novel, that "the Father had suffered". The author of the Little
   Labyrinth reminds them that Theodotus had been already excommunicated
   by Victor, and of this fact they themselves cannot have been ignorant.
   When, moreover, we observe the evident anxiety of the writer to impose
   Theodotus upon them as their spiritual father, we come to the
   conclusion that the party did not identify themselves with the
   Theodotians. What they regarded as the point of difference we do not
   know. It is alone certain that they also refused to call Christ "God";
   for the writer feels it necessary to justify the use of the title from
   tradition. [58] Artemas was still alive in Rome at the close of the 7th
   decade of the 3rd century, but he was completely severed from the great
   Church, and without any real influence. No notice is taken of him even
   in the letters of Cyprian. [59] Since Artemas was characterised as the
   "father" of Paul in the controversy with that Bishop (Euseb. H. E. VII.
   30. 16), he had afterwards attained a certain celebrity in the East,
   and had supplanted even Theodotus in the recollection of the Church. In
   the subsequent age, the phrase: "Ebion, Artemas, Paulus (or Photinus)"
   was stereotyped; this was afterwards supplemented with the name of
   Nestorius, and in that form the phrase became a constant feature in
   Byzantine dogmatics and polemics.

   (c). Traces of Adoptian Christology in the West after Artemas.

   Adoptian Christology -- Dynamistic Monarchianism -- apparently passed
   rapidly and almost entirely away in the West. The striking formula,
   settled by the Symbol, "Christus, homo et deus", and, above all, the
   conviction that Christ had appeared in the O. T., brought about the
   destruction of the party. Yet, here and there -- in connection,
   doubtless, with the reading of Hermas [60] -- the old faith, or the old
   formula, that the Holy Spirit is the eternal Son of God and at the same
   time the Christ-Spirit, held its ground, and, with it, conceptions
   which bordered on Adoptianism. Thus we read in the writing "De montibus
   Sina et Sion" [61] composed in vulgar Latin and attributed wrongly to
   Cyprian, ch. IV: "The body of the Lord was called Jesus by God the
   Father; the Holy Spirit that descended from heaven was called Christ by
   God the Father, i.e., anointed of the living God, the Spirit joined to
   the body Jesus Christ" (Caro dominica a deo patre Jesu vocita est;
   spiritus sanctus, qui de c√¶lo descendit, Christus, id est unctus dei
   vivi, a deo vocitus est, spiritus carni mixtus Jesus Christus). Compare
   ch. XIII.: the H. S., Son of God, sees Himself double, the Father sees
   Himself in the Son, the Son in the Father, each in each (Sanctus
   spiritus, dei filius, geminatum se videt, pater in filio et filius in
   patre utrosque se in se vident). There were accordingly only two
   hypostases, and the Redeemer is the flesh (caro), to which the
   pre-existent Holy Spirit, the eternal Son of God, the Christ,
   descended. Whether the author understood Christ as "forming a person"
   or as a power cannot be decided; probably, being no theologian, the
   question did not occur to him. [62] We do not hear that the doctrine of
   Photinus, who was himself a Greek, gained any considerable approval in
   the West. But we learn casually that even in the beginning of the 5th
   century a certain Marcus was expelled from Rome for holding the heresy
   of Photinus, and that he obtained a following in Dalmatia. Incomparably
   more instructive, however, is the account given by Augustine (Confess.
   VII. 19. [25]) of his own and his friend Alypius' Christological
   belief, at a time when both stood quite near the Catholic Church, and
   had been preparing to enter it. At that time Augustine's view of Christ
   was practically that of Photinus; and Alypius denied that Christ had a
   human soul; yet both had held their Christology to be Catholic, and
   only afterwards learned better. [63] Now let us remember that Augustine
   had enjoyed a Catholic education, and had been in constant intercourse
   with Catholics, and we see clearly that among the laity of the West
   very little was known of the Christological formulas, and very
   different doctrines of Christ were in fact current even at the close of
   the 4th century. [64]

   (d). The Ejection of the Adoptian Christology in the East, -- Beryll of
   Bostra, Paul of Samosata, etc.

   We can see from the writings of Origen that there were also many in the
   East who rejected the Logos Christology. Those were undoubtedly most
   numerous who identified the Father and the Son; but there were not
   wanting such as, while they made a distinction, attributed to the Soh a
   human nature only, [65] and accordingly taught like the Theodotians.
   Origen by no means treated them, as a rule, as declared heretics, but
   as misled, or "simple", Christian brethren who required friendly
   teaching. He himself, besides, had also inserted the Adoptian
   Christology into his complicated doctrine of Christ; for he had
   attached the greatest value to the tenet that Jesus should be held a
   real man who had been chosen by God, who in virtue of his free will,
   had steadfastly attested his excellence, and who, at last, had become
   perfectly fused with the Logos in disposition, will, and finally also
   in nature (see Vol. II., p. 369 f.). Origen laid such decided emphasis
   on this that his opponents afterwards classed him with Paul of Samosata
   and Artemas, [66] and Pamphilus required to point out "that Origen said
   that the Son of God was born of the very substance of God, i.e., was
   homoousios, which means, of the same substance with the Father, but
   that he was not a creature who became a son by adoption, but a true son
   by nature, generated by the Father Himself" (quod Origines filium dei
   de ipsa dei substantia natum dixerit, id est, homoousion, quod est,
   eiusdem cum patre substanti√¶, et non esse creaturam per adoptionem sed
   natura filium verum, ex ipso patre generatum). [67] &gt;So Origen in
   fact taught, and he was very far from seeing more in the Adoptian
   doctrine than a fragment of the complete Christology. He attempted to
   convince the Adoptians of their error, more correctly, of their
   questionable one-sidedness, [68] but he had seldom any other occasion
   to contend with them.

   Perhaps we should here include the action against Beryll of Bostra.
   This Arabian Bishop taught Monarchianism. His doctrine aroused a
   violent opposition. The Bishops of the province were deeply agitated
   and instituted many examinations and discussions. But they appear not
   to have come to any result. Origen was called in, and, as we are
   informed by Eusebius, who had himself examined the acts of the Synods,
   he succeeded in a disputation in amicably convincing the Bishop of his
   error. [69] This happened, according to the common view, in A.D. 244.
   We have to depend, for the teaching of Beryll, on one sentence in
   Eusebius, which has received very different interpretations. [70]
   Nitzsch says rightly, [71] that Eusebius missed in Beryll the
   recognition of the separate divine personality (hypostasis) in Christ
   and of his pre-existence, but not the recognition of his deity.
   However, this is not enough to class the Bishop with certainty among
   the Patripassians, since Eusebius' own Christological view, by which
   that of Beryll was here gauged, was very vague. Even the circumstance,
   that at the Synod of Bostra (according to Socrates) Christ was
   expressly decreed to have a human soul, is not decisive; for Origen
   might have carried the recognition of this dogma, which was of the
   highest importance to him, whatever the doctrine of Beryll had been.
   That the Bishop rather taught Dynamistic Monarchianism is supported,
   first, by the circumstance that this form of doctrine had, as we can
   prove, long persisted in Arabia and Syria; and, secondly, by the
   observation that Origen, in the fragment of his commentary on the Ep.
   of Titus (see above), has contrasted with the Patripassian belief [72]
   a kind of teaching which seems to coincide with that of Beryll.
   Primitive Dynamistic Monarchian conceptions must, however, be imputed
   also to those Egyptian Millenarians whom Dionysius of Alexandria
   opposed, and whom he considered it necessary to instruct "in the
   glorious and truly divine appearing of our Lord" (peri tes endoxou kai
   alethos entheou tou kuriou hemon epiphaneias [73]

   These were all, indeed, isolated and relatively unimportant phenomena;
   but they prove that even about the middle of the 3rd century the Logos
   Christology was not universally recognised in the East, and that the
   Monarchians were still treated indulgently. [74] Decisive action was
   first taken and Adoptianism was ranked in the East with Ebionitism as a
   heresy, in the case of the incumbent of the most exalted Bishopric in
   the East, Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch from 260, but perhaps a
   little earlier. He opposed the already dominant doctrine of the
   essential natural deity of Christ, and set up once more the old view of
   the human Person of the Redeemer. [75] That happened at a time when,
   through Alexandrian theology, the use of the categories logos (word),
   ousia (being), hupostasis (substance), enupostatos (subsisting),
   prosopon (person), perigraphe ousias (configuration of essence), etc.,
   had almost already become legitimised, and when in the widest circles
   the idea had taken root that the Person of Jesus Christ must be
   accorded a background peculiar to itself, and essentially divine.

   We do not know the circumstances in which Paul felt himself impelled to
   attack the form of doctrine taught by Alexandrian philosophy. Yet it is
   noticeable that it was not a province of the Roman Empire, but Antioch,
   then belonging to Palmyra, which was the scene of this movement. When
   we observe that Paul held a high political office in the kingdom of
   Zenobia, that close relations are said to have existed between him and
   the Queen, and that his fall implied the triumph of the Roman party in
   Antioch, then we may assume that a political conflict lay behind the
   theological, and that Paul's opponents belonged to the Roman party in
   Syria. It was not easy to get at the distinguished Metropolitan and
   experienced theologian, who was indeed portrayed by his enemies as an
   unspiritual ecclesiastical prince, vain preacher, ambitious man of the
   world, and wily Sophist. The provincial Synod, over which he presided,
   did not serve the purpose. But already, in the affair of Novatian,
   which had threatened to split up the East, the experiment had been
   tried A.D. 252 (253) of holding an Oriental general-council, and that
   with success. It was repeated. A great Synod -- we do not know who
   called it -- met in Antioch A.D. 264; Bishops from various parts of the
   East attended it, and, especially, Firmilian of Caesarea. The aged
   Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, excused his absence in a letter in
   which he did not take Paul's side. The first Synod came to an end
   without result, because, it is alleged, the accused had cunningly
   concealed his false doctrines. [76] A second was also unsuccessful.
   Firmilian himself gave up the idea of a condemnation "because Paul
   promised to change his opinions." It was only at a third Synod, between
   266 and 269, probably 268, at Antioch, Firmilian having died at Tarsus
   on his way thither, that excommunication was pronounced on the Bishop,
   and his successor Domnus was appointed. The number of the members of
   Synod is stated differently at 70, 80, and 180; and the argument
   against Paul was led by Malchion, a sophist of Antioch and head of a
   high school, as also a presbyter of the Church. He alone among them all
   was in a position to unmask that "wily and deceitful man." The Acts of
   the discussion together with a detailed epistle, were sent by the Synod
   to Rome, Alexandria, and all Catholic Churches. Paul, protected by
   Zenobia, remained four years longer in his office; the Church in
   Antioch split up: "there took place schisms among the people, revolts
   among the priests, confusion among the pastors" (egenonto schismata
   laon, akatastasiai hiereon, tarache poimenon). [77] In the year A.D.
   272 Antioch was at last taken by Aurelian, and the Emperor, to whom an
   appeal was brought, pronounced on the spot the famous judgment, that
   the Church building was to be handed to him with whom the Christian
   Bishops of Italy and of Rome corresponded by letter. This decision was
   of course founded on political grounds. [78]

   The teaching of Paul was characterised by the Fathers as a renewal of
   that of Artemas, but sometimes also as Neo-Jewish, Ebionitic,
   afterwards as Nestorian Monothelite, etc. It was follows. God was
   simply to be regarded as one person. Father, Son, and Spirit were the
   One God (hen pro'sopon). In God a Logos (Son) or a Sophia (Spirit) can
   be distinguished -- both can again according to Paul become identified
   -- but they are qualities. [79] God puts forth of Himself the Logos
   from Eternity, nay, He begets him, so that he can be called Son and can
   have being ascribed to him, but he remains an impersonal power. [80]
   Therefore it was absolutely impossible for him to assume a visible
   form. [81] This Logos operated in the prophets, to a still higher
   degree in Moses, then in many others, and most of all (mallon kai`
   diaphero'ntos) in the Son of David, born of the virgin by the Holy
   Ghost. The Redeemer was by the constitution of his nature a man, who
   arose in time by birth; he was accordingly "from beneath", but the
   Logos of God inspired him from above. [82] The union of the Logos with
   the man Jesus is to be represented as an indwelling [83] by means of an
   inspiration acting from without, [84] so that the Logos becomes that in
   Jesus which in the Christian is called by the Apostle "the inner man";
   but the union which is thus originated is a contact in knowledge and
   communion (sunapheia kata mathesin kai metousian) a coming together
   (suneleusis); there does not arise a being existent in a body (ousia
   ousiomene en somati), i.e., the Logos dwelt in Jesus not "in substance
   but in quality" (ousiodos, alla kata poioteta). [85] Therefore the
   Logos is to be steadily distinguished from Jesus; [86] he is greater
   than the latter. [87] Mary did not bear the Logos, but a man like us in
   his nature, and in his baptism it was not the Logos, but the man, who
   was anointed with the Spirit. [88] However, Jesus was, on the other
   hand, vouchsafed the divine grace in a special degree, [89] and his
   position was unique. [90] Moreover, the proof he gave of his moral
   perfection corresponded to his peculiar equipment. [91] The only unity
   between two persons, accordingly between God and Jesus, is that of the
   disposition and the will. [92] Such unity springs from love alone; but
   love can certainly produce a complete unity, and only that which is due
   to love  -- not that attained by "nature" -- is of worth. Jesus was
   like God in the unchangeableness of his love and his will, and became
   one with God, being not only without sin himself, but vanquishing, in
   conflict and labour, the sins of our ancestor. As he himself, however,
   advanced in the manifestation of goodness and continued in it, the
   Father furnished him with power and miracles, in which he made known
   his steadfast conformity to the will of God. So he became the Redeemer
   and Saviour of the human race, and at the same time entered into an
   eternally indissoluble union with God, because his love can never
   cease. Now he has obtained from God, as the reward of his love, the
   name which is above every name; God has committed to him the judgment,
   [93] and invested him with divine dignity, so that now we can call him
   "God [born] of the virgin". [94] So also we are entitled to speak of a
   pre-existence of Christ in the prior decree [95] and prophecy [96] of
   God, and to say that he became God through divine grace and his
   constant manifestation of goodness. [97] Paul undoubtedly perceived in
   the imparting of the Spirit at the baptism a special stage of the
   indwelling of the Logos in the man Jesus; indeed Jesus seems only to
   have been Christ from his baptism: "having been anointed with the Holy
   Spirit he was named Christ -- the anointed son of David is not
   different from wisdom" (to hagio pneumati christheis prosegoreuthe
   Christos -- ho ek Dabid christheis ouk allotrios esti tes sophias) The
   Bishop supported his doctrine by copious proofs from Scripture, [98]
   and he also attacked the opposite views. He sought to prove that the
   assumption that Jesus was by nature (phu'sei) Son of God, led to having
   two gods, [99] to the destruction of Monotheism; [100] he fought
   openly, with great energy, against the old expositors, i.e., the
   Alexandrians, [101] and he banished from divine service all Church
   psalms in which the essential divinity of Christ was expressed. [102]

   The teaching of Paul was certainly a development of the old doctrine of
   Hermas and Theodotus, and the Church Fathers had a right to judge it
   accordingly; but on the other hand we must not overlook the fact that
   Paul not only, as regards form, adapted himself more closely to the
   accepted terminology, but that he also gave to the ancient type of
   doctrine, already heterodox, a philosophical, an Aristotelian, basis,
   and treated it ethically and biblically. He undoubtedly learned much
   from Origen; but he recognised the worthlessness of the double
   personality construed by Origen, for he has deepened the exposition
   given by the latter of the personality of Christ, and seen that "what
   is attained by nature is void of merit" (ta kratoumena to logo tes
   phuseos ouk echei epainon). Paul's expositions of nature and will in
   the Persons, of the essence and power of love, of the divinity of
   Christ, only to be perceived in the work of His ministry, because
   exclusively contained in unity of will with God, are almost
   unparalleled in the whole dogmatic literature of the Oriental Churches
   in the first three centuries. For, when such passages do occur in
   Origen, they at once disappear again in metaphysics, and we do not know
   the arguments of the Alogi and the Theodotians. [103] It is, above all,
   the deliberate rejection of metaphysical speculation which
   distinguishes Paul; he substituted for it the study of history and the
   determination of worth on moral grounds alone, thus reversing Origen's
   maxim: ho soter ou kat' metousian, alla kat' ousian esti theos (the
   Saviour is God not by communion, but in essence). As he kept his
   dogmatic theology free from Platonism, his difference with his
   opponents began in his conception of God. The latter described the
   controversy very correctly, when they said that Paul "had betrayed the
   mystery of the Christian faith," [104] i.e., the mystic conception of
   God and Christ due to natural philosophy; or [105] when they complained
   of Paul's denial that the difficulty of maintaining the unity of deity,
   side by side with a plurality of persons, was got over simply by making
   the Father their source. What is that but to admit that Paul started in
   his idea of God, not from the substance, but from the person? He here
   represented the interests of theism as against the chaotic naturalism
   of Platonism And in appreciating the character of Jesus he refused to
   recognise its uniqueness and divinity in his "nature"; these he found
   only in his disposition and the direction of his will. Therefore while
   Christ as a person was never to him "mere man" (psilos anthropos), yet
   Christ's natural endowment he would not recognise as exceptional. But
   as Christ had been predestinated by God in a unique manner, so in
   conformity to the promises the Spirit and the grace of God rested on
   him exceptionally; and thus his work in his vocation and his life, with
   and in God, had been unique. This view left room for a human life, and
   if Paul has, ultimately, used the formula, that Christ had become God,
   his appeal to Philipp. II. 9 shows in what sense he understood the
   words.

   His opponents, indeed, charged him with sophistically and deceitfully
   concealing his true opinion behind phrases with an orthodox sound. It
   is possible, in view of the fact, e.g., that he called the impersonal
   Logos "Son", that there is some truth in this; but it is not probable.
   He was not understood, or rather he was misunderstood. Many theologians
   at the present day regard the theology of Hermas as positively Nicene,
   although it is hardly a whit more orthodox than that of Paul. If such a
   misunderstanding is possible to the scholars of to-day -- and Hermas
   was certainly no dissembler, -- why can Firmilian not have looked on
   Paul as orthodox for a time? He taught that there was an eternal Son of
   God, and that he dwelt in Jesus; he proclaimed the divinity of Christ,
   held there were two persons (God and Jesus), and with the Alexandrians
   rejected Sabellianism. On this very point, indeed, a sort of concession
   seems to have been made to him at the Synod. We know that the Synod
   expressly censured the term "homoousios", [106] and this was done,
   Athanasius conjectures, to meet an objection of Paul. He is said to
   have argued as follows: -- If Christ is not, as he taught, essentially
   human, then he is homoousios; with the Father. But if that be true then
   the Father is not the ultimate source of the deity, but Being (the
   ousia), and thus we have three ousiai; [107] in other words the
   divinity of the Father is itself derivative, and the Father is of
   identical origin with the Son, -- "they become brothers". This can have
   been an objection made by Paul. The Aristotelian conception of the
   ousia would correspond to his turn of thought, and so would the
   circumstance, that the possibility of a subordinate, natural, divinity
   on the part of the Son is left out of the question. The Synod again can
   very well have rejected homoousios in the interests of
   anti-sabellianism. [108] Yet it is just as possible that, as Hilarius
   says, the Synod condemned the term because Paul himself had declared
   God and the impersonal Logos (the Son) to be homoousios, i.e., "of the
   same substance, of one substance." [109] However that may be, whenever
   Paul's view was seen through, it was at once felt by the majority to be
   in the highest degree heretical. No one was yet quite clear as to what
   sort of thing this "naturally -- divine" element in Christ was. Even
   Origen had taught that he possessed a divinity to which prayer might
   not be offered. [110] But to deny the divine nature (physis) to the
   Redeemer, was universally held to be an attack on the Rule of Faith.
   [111] They correctly perceived the really weak point in Paul's
   Christology, his teaching, namely, that there were actually two Sons of
   God; [112] Hermas, however, had already preached this, and Paul was not
   in earnest about the "eternal Son". Yet this was only a secondary
   matter. The crucial difference had its root in the question as to the
   divine nature (physis) of the Redeemer.

   Now here it is of the highest interest to notice how far, in the minds
   of many Bishops in Palestine and Syria, the speculative interpretation
   of the Rule of Faith had taken the place of that rule itself. If we
   compare the letter of Hymen√¶us of Jerusalem and his five colleagues to
   Paul with the regula fidei -- not, say, that of Tertullian and Iren√¶us
   -- but the Rule of Faith with which Origen has headed his great work:
   peri archon then we are astonished at the advance in the times. The
   Bishops explain at the opening of their letter, [113] that they desired
   to expound," in writing, the faith which we received from the
   beginning, and possess, having been transmitted and kept in the
   Catholic Church, proclaimed up to our day by the successors of the
   blessed Apostles, who were both eye-witnesses and assistants of the
   Logos, from the law and prophets and the New Testament." (engraphon ten
   pistin hen ex arches parelabomen kai echomen paradotheisan kai
   teroumenen en te katholike kai hagia ekklesia, mechri tes semeron
   hemeras ek diadoches apo ton makarion apostolon, ohi kai autoptai kai
   huperetai gegonasi tou logou, katangellomenen, ek nomou kai propheton
   kai tes kaines diathekes.) But what they presented as "the faith" and
   furnished with proofs from Scripture, was the speculative theology,
   [114] In no other writing can we see the triumph in the sphere of
   religion of the theology of philosophy or of Origen, i.e., of
   Hellenism, so clearly, as in this letter, in which philosophical
   dogmatics are put forward as the faith itself. But further. At the end
   of the third century even the baptismal confessions were expanded in
   the East by the adoption of propositions borrowed from philosophical
   theology; [115] or, to put it in another way, -- baptismal confessions
   apparently now first formulated, were introduced in many Oriental
   communities, which also now contained the doctrine of the Logos. Since
   these statements were directed against Sabellianism as well as against
   "Ebionitism"; they will be discussed later on.

   With the deposition and removal of Paul the historian's interest in his
   case is at an end. It was henceforth no longer possible to gain a
   hearing, in the great forum of Church life, for a Christology which did
   not include the personal pre-existence of the Redeemer: no one was
   permitted henceforth to content himself with the elucidation of the
   divinely-human life of Jesus in his work. It was necessary to believe
   in the divine nature (physis) of the Redeemer. [116] The smaller and
   remote communities were compelled to imitate the attitude of the
   larger. Yet we know from the circular letter of Alexander of
   Alexandria, A.D. 321, [117] that the doctrine of Paul did not by any
   means pass away without leaving a trace. Lucian and his famous academy,
   the alma mater of Arianism, were inspired by the genius of Paul. [118]
   Lucian -- himself perhaps, a native of Samosata -- had, during the
   incumbency of three Bishops of Antioch, remained, like Theodotus and
   his party in Rome, at the head of a school outside of the great
   Catholic Church. [119] In his teaching, and in that of Arius, the
   foundation laid by Paul is unmistakable. [120] But Lucian has falsified
   the fundamental thought of Paul in yielding to the assumption of a
   Logos, though a very subordinate and created Logos, and in putting this
   in the place of the man Jesus, while his disciples, the Arians, have,
   in the view sketched by them of the person of Christ, been unable to
   retain the features Paul ascribed to it; though they also have
   emphasised the importance of the will in Christ. We must conclude,
   however, that Arianism, as a whole, is nothing but a compromise between
   the Adoptian and the Logos Christology, which proves that after the
   close of the 3rd century, no Christology was possible in the Church
   which failed to recognise the personal pre-existence of Christ.

   Photinus approximated to Paul of Samosata in the fourth century. Above
   all, however, the great theologians of Antioch occupied a position by
   no means remote from him; for the presupposition of the personal Logos
   Homousios in Christ, which they as Church theologians had to accept
   simply, could be combined much better with the thought of Paul, than
   the Arian assumption of a subordinate god, with attributes half-human,
   half-divine. So also the arguments of Theodore of Mopsuestia as to the
   relation of the Logos and the man Jesus, as to nature, will,
   disposition, etc., are here and there verbally identical with those of
   Paul; and his opponents, especially Leontius, [121] were not so far
   wrong in charging Theodore with teaching like Paul. [122] Paul was in
   fact condemned a second time in the great scholars of Antioch, and --
   strangely -- his name was once more mentioned, and for the third time,
   in the Monothelite controversy. In this case his statements as to the
   one will (mia thelesis sc. of God and Jesus) were shamefully misused,
   in order to show to the opposition that their doctrine had been already
   condemned in the person of the arch-heretic.

   We possess, however, another ancient source of information, of the
   beginning of the 4th century, the Acta Archelai. [123] This shows us
   that at the extreme eastern boundary of Christendom there persisted
   even among Catholic clerics, if we may use here the word Catholic,
   Christological conceptions which had remained unaffected by Alexandrian
   theology, and must be classed with Adoptianism. The author's exposition
   of Christ consists, so far as we can judge, in the doctrine of Paul of
   Samosata. [124] Here we are shown clearly that the Logos Christology
   had, at the beginning of the 4th century, not yet passed beyond the
   borders of the Christendom comprehended in the Roman Empire.

   [22] H√¶r.51; after him Augustine H.30, Pr√¶dest. H.30 etc. The statement
   of the Pr√¶dest. that a Bishop named Philo refuted the Alogi is
   worthless. Whether the choice of the name was due to the Alexandrian
   Jew is unknown.

   [23] Nothing is reported as to the Letters. Epiphanius is perhaps right
   in representing that they were also rejected (1.c. ch. 34); but perhaps
   they were not involved in the discussion.

   [24] See the list of writings on the statue of Hippolytus: uper tou
   kata ioan[n]en euangeliou kai apokalupseos; and Ebed Jesu, catal. 7
   (Assemani, Bibl. Orient. III. 1, 15): "Apologia pro apocalypsi et
   evangelio Johannis apostoli et evangelist√¶." Besides this Hippolytus
   wrote: "Capita adversus Caium," a Roman sympathiser with the Alogi. Of
   this writing a few fragments have been preserved (Gwynn, Hermathena
   VI., p. 397 f.; Harnack, Texte und Unters. VI. 3, p. 121 ff.; Zahn,
   Gesch. des N. T. Kanons, II., p. 973 ff.

   [25] It is certain that Epiphanius, besides the relative section of the
   Syntagma, also copied at least a second writing against the "Alogi",
   and it is probable that this likewise came from Hippolytus. The date of
   its composition can still be pretty accurately determined from Epiphan.
   H.31, ch. 33. It was written about A.D. 234; for Epiphanius' authority
   closes the period of the Apostles 93 years after the Ascension, and
   remarks that since that date 112 years had elapsed. Lipsius has
   obtained another result, but only by an emendation of the text which is
   unnecessary (see Quellen der √§ltesten Ketzergeschichte, p. 109 f.).
   Hippolytus treats his unnamed opponents as contemporaries; but a closer
   examination shows that he only knew them from their writings -- of
   which there were several (see ch. 33), and therefore knew nothing by
   personal observation of the conditions under which they appeared. A
   certain criterion of the age of these writings, and therefore of the
   party itself, is given by the fact that, at the time when the latter
   flourished, the only Church at Thyatira was, from their own testimony,
   Montanist, while the above-mentioned authority was already able to tell
   of a rising catholic Church, and of other Christian communities in that
   place. A Christian of Thyatira, by name Papylus, appears in the
   Martyrium Carpi et Papyli (see Harnack, Texte u. Unters. III. 3, 4).
   The date when this movement in Asia Minor flourished can be discovered
   more definitely, however, by a combination, proved by Zahn to be
   justified, of the statements of Hippolytus and Iren√¶us III. 11. 9.
   According to this, the party existed in Asia Minor, A.D. 170-180.

   [26] Epiph. LI., ch 4: phaskousi hoti ou sumphonei ta biblia tou
   Ioannou tois loipois apostolois, ch. 18: to euangelion to eis honoma
   Ioannou pseudetai . . . legousi to kata Ioannen euangelion, epeide me
   ta auta tois apostolois ephe, adiatheton einai.

   [27] Epiphanius has preserved for us in part the criticism of the Alogi
   on John I. II., and on the Johannine chronology (ch. 3, 4, 15, 18, 22,
   26, 28, 29). In their conception the Gospel of John precluded the human
   birth and development of Jesus.

   [28] Epiph. LI. 3, 28: ton logon tou Theou apoballontai ton dia Ioannen
   ketuchthenta.

   En to Iordane katelthe to tneuma 'ep' auton kai phone; Houtos estin ho
   huios ho agapetos, 'eph hon eudokesa.

   [30] This milder criticism -- and neither Montanists nor Alogi stand in
   Iren√¶us' catalogue of heretics -- naturally did not prevent the view
   that those "unhappy people" had got into an extremely bad position by
   their opposition to the prophetic activity of the Spirit in the Church,
   and had fallen into the unforgivable sin against the Holy Ghost.

   [31] In Epiph. LI., ch. 4: dokusi kai` autoi` ta isa hemin pisteu'ein.

   [32] Quellen, p. 102 f., 112.

   [33] It is not quite certain whether we may appeal to the words in
   Epiph. LI., ch. 18 (20): nomizontes apo Marias kai deuro Christon auton
   kaleisthai kai huion Theou, kai heinai men proteron psilon anthropon,
   kata prokopen de eilephenai ten tou Theou prosegorian.

   [34] As regards the problem of the origin and gradual reception of the
   Johannine writings, and especially of the Gospel, their use by
   Montanus, and their abrupt rejection by the Alogi, are of the greatest
   significance, especially when we bear in mind the Churchly character of
   the latter. The rise of such an opposition in the very region in which
   the Gospel undoubtedly first came to light; the application to the
   fourth of a standard derived from the Synoptic Gospels; the denial
   without scruple, of its apostolic origin; are facts which it seems to
   me have, at the present day, not been duly appreciated. We must not
   weaken their force by an appeal to the dogmatic character of the
   criticism practised by the Alogi; the attestation of the Gospel cannot
   have been convincing, if such a criticism was ventured on in the
   Church. But the Alogi distinctly denied to John and ascribed to
   Cerinthus the Apocalypse as well as the Gospel. Of Cerinthus we know
   far too little to be justified in sharing in the holy horror of the
   Church Fathers. But even if the above hypothesis is false, and it is in
   fact very probable that it is, yet the very fact that it could be set
   up by Churchmen is instructive enough; for it shows us, what we do not
   know from any other source, that the Johannine writings met with, and
   had to overcome, opposition in their birth-place.

   [35] The Roman Caius took over this criticism from them, as is shown by
   Hippolytus' Cap. adv. Caium. But, like Theodotus, to be mentioned
   presently, he rejected the view of the Alogi as regards John's Gospel.

   luth. Kirke. Ny Raekke, Bd. VIII., part 3, pp. 307-337. Authorities for
   the older Theodotus are; (1) the Syntagma of Hippolytus according to
   Epiph. H.54, Philaster H. 50. and Pseudo-Tertull. H. 28; (2) the
   Philosophumena VII. 35, X. 23, IX. 3, 12, X. 27; (3) the fragment of
   Hippolytus against No√´tus, ch. 3. 4) the fragments from the so-called
   Little Labyrinth (in Euseb. H. E. V. 28), which was perhaps by
   Hippolytus, and was written in the fourth decade of the third century,
   and after the Philosophumena. This work was directed against Roman
   Dynamistic Monarchians under the leadership of a certain Artemas, who
   are to be distinguished from the Theodotians. (For the age and author
   of the Little Labyrinth, and for its connection with the writings
   against the Alogi and against No√´tus; also for the appearance of
   Artemas, which is not to be dated before ¬± 235: see Caspari, Quellen
   l.c., and my art. "Monarchianismus", p. 186). Eusebius has confined his
   extracts from the Little Labyrinth to such as deal with the
   Theodotians. These extracts and Philos. Lib. X. are used by Theodoret
   (H. F. II. 4. 5); it is not probable that the latter had himself
   examined the Little Labyrinth. A writing of Theodotus seems to have
   been made use of in the Syntagma of Hippolytus. As regards the younger
   Theodotus, his name has been handed down by the Little Labyrinth, the
   Philosoph. (VII. 36) and Pseudo-Tertull. H. 29 (Theodoret H. F. II. 6).
   The Syntagma tells of a party of Melchizedekians, which is traced in
   the Philosoph. and by the Pseudo-Tertullian to the younger Theodotus,
   but neither the party nor its founder is named. Very mysterious in
   contents and origin is the piece, edited for the first time from
   Parisian MSS. by Caspari (see above): peri` Melchisedekianon kai`
   Theodotianon kai Athinganon. The only controversial writing known to us
   against Artemas (Artemon) is the Little Labyrinth. Unfortunately
   Eusebius has not excerpted the passages aimed at him. Artemas is,
   again, omitted in the Syntagma and in the Philosoph. For this reason
   Epiphanius, Pseudo-Tertull. and Philaster have no articles expressly
   dealing with him. He is, however, mentioned prominently in the edict of
   the last Synod of Antioch held to oppose Paul of Samosata (so also in
   the Ep. Alexandri in Theodoret H. E. I. 3 and in Pamphilus' Apology Pro
   Orig. in Routh, Reliq. S. IV. p. 367); therefore many later writers
   against the heretics have named him (Epiph. H. 65. 1, esp. Theodoret H.
   F. II. 6. etc.). Finally, let it be noticed that the statements in the
   Synodicon Pappi, and in the Pr√¶destinatus are worthless, and that the
   identification of the younger Theodotus with the Gnostic of the same
   name, extracts from whose works we possess, is inadmissable, not less
   so than the identification with Theodotus, the Montanist, of whom we
   are informed by Eusebius. In this we agree with Zahn (Forschungen III.,
   p. 123) against Neander and Dorner. As an authority for the Roman
   Monarchians, Novatian, De Trinitate, also falls to be considered.

   [37] It is significant that this took place in Rome. The Syntagma is
   further able to tell that Theodotus had denied Christ during the
   persecution in his native city before he came to Rome. See on this
   point my article on Monarchianism) p. 187.

   [38] VII. 35: phaskon ta peri men tes tou pantos arches sumphona ek
   merous tois tes alethous ekklesias, hupo tou Theou panta homologon
   gegonenai.

   [39] Philos. VII. 35: Theon de oudepote touton gegonenai thelousin epi
   te kathodo tou pneumatos, heteroi de meta ten ek nekron anastasin. The
   description in the text is substantially taken from the Philos., with
   whose account the contents of the Syntagma are not inconsistent. The
   statement that Theodotus denied the birth by the virgin is simply a
   calumny, first alleged by Epiphanius. The account of the Philos. seems
   unreliable, at most, on a single point, viz., where, interpreting
   Theodotus, it calls the Spirit which descended at the baptism "Christ"
   But possibly this too is correct, seeing that Hermas, and, later, the
   author of the Acta Archelai have also identified the Holy Spirit with
   the Son of God. (Compare also what Origen [peri` arch. pref.] has
   reported as Church tradition on the Holy Spirit.) In that case we would
   only have to substitute the "Son of God" for "Christ", and to suppose
   that Hippolytus chose the latter term in order to be able to
   characterise the teaching of Theodotus as Gnostic (Cerinthian). On the
   possibility that the Theodotians, however, really named the Holy Spirit
   "Christ", see later on.

   [40] Epiphanius mentions the appeal of the Theodotians to Deut. XVIII.
   15; Jer. XVII. 9; Isa. LIII. 2 f.; Mat. XII. 31; Luke I. 35; John VIII.
   40; Acts II. 22; 1 Tim. II. 5. They deduced from Mat. XII. 31, that the
   Holy Spirit held a higher place than the Son of Man. The treatment of
   the verses in Deut. and Luke is especially instructive. In the former
   Theodotus emphasised, not only the "prophe'ten hos eme'", and the "ek
   ton adelphon", but also the "egerei", and concluded referring the
   passage to the Resurrection: ho ek Theou egeiromenos Christos houtos
   ouk en Theos alla anthropos, epeide ex auton en, hos kai Mouses
   anthropos en -- accordingly the resuscitated Christ was not God. On
   Luke I. 35 he argued thus: "The Gospel itself says in reference to
   Mary: the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee'; but it does not say:
   the Spirit of the Lord will be in thy body', or, will enter into
   thee.'" -- Further, if we may trust Epiphanius, Theodotus sought to
   divide the sentence -- dio` kai` to` genno'menon ek sou hagion
   klethe'setai huio`s Theou -- , from the first half of the verse, as if
   the words "dio kai" did not exist, so that he obtained the meaning that
   the Sonship of Christ would only begin later, -- subsequent to the
   test. Perhaps, however, Theodotus entirely deleted "dio kai", just as
   he also read "pneuma kuriou" for "pneuma hagion" in order to avoid all
   ambiguity. And since Hippolytus urges against him that John I. 14 did
   not contain "to pneuma sarx egeneto", Theodotus must at least have
   interpreted the word "logos" in the sense of "ponuma"; and an ancient
   formula really ran: "Christos on men to proton pneuma egeneto sarx" (2
   Clem. IX. 5), where later "logos" was, indeed, inserted in place of
   "pneuma". See the Cod. Constantinop.

   [41] Euseb. (H. E. V. 28): "They falsified the Holy Scriptures without
   scruple, rejected the standards of the ancient faith, and misunderstood
   Christ. For they did not examine what the Scriptures said, but
   carefully considered what logical figure they could obtain from it that
   would prove their godless teaching. And if any one brought before them
   a passage from Holy Scripture, they asked whether a conjunctive or
   disjunctive figure could be made of it. They set aside the Holy
   Scriptures of God, and employ themselves, instead, with geometry, being
   men who are earthly, and talk of what is earthly, and know not what
   comes from above. Some of them, therefore, study the geometry of Euclid
   with the greatest devotion; Aristotle and Theophrastus are admired;
   Galen is even worshipped by some. But what need is there of words to
   show that men who misuse the sciences of the unbelievers to prove their
   heretical views, and falsify with their own godless cunning the plain
   faith of Scripture, do not even stand on the borders of the faith? They
   have therefore laid their hands so unscrupulously on the Holy
   Scriptures under the pretext that they had only amended it critically
   (diorthokenai). He who will can convince himself that this is no
   calumny. For, if one should collect the manuscripts of any one of them
   and compare them, he would find them differ in many passages. At least,
   the manuscripts of Asclepiodotus do not agree with those of Theodotus.
   But we can have examples of this to excess; for their scholars have
   noted with ambitious zeal all that any one of them has, as they say,
   critically amended, i.e., distorted (effaced?). Again, with these the
   manuscripts of Hermophilus do not agree; and those of Apollonides even
   differ from each other. For if we compare the manuscripts first
   restored by them (him?) with the later re-corrected copies, variations
   are found in many places. But some of them have not even found it worth
   the trouble to falsify the Holy Scriptures, but have simply rejected
   the Law and the Prophets, and have by this lawless and godless doctrine
   hurled themselves, under the pretext of grace, into the deepest abyss
   of perdition.

   [43] See V. 28. 4, 5.

   [44] The triumph of Neo-platonic philosophy and of the Logos
   Christology in Christian theology is, in this sense, to be considered
   an advance. That philosophy, indeed, in the third century, triumphed
   throughout the empire over its rivals, and therefore the exclusive
   alliance concluded with it by Christian tradition was one which, when
   it took place, could be said to have been inevitable. Suppose, however,
   that the theology of Sabellius or of Paul had established itself in the
   Church in the 3rd century, then a gulf would have been created between
   the Church and Hellenism that would have made it impossible for the
   religion of the Church to become that of the empire. Neo-platonic
   tradition was the final product of antiquity; it disposed, but as a
   living force, of the intellectual and moral capital of the past.

   [45] As "genuine" scholars -- and this is a very characteristic feature
   -- they took very great care that each should have the credit of his
   own amendments on the text.

   [46] The Syntagma knows of these; Epiph. H. 55. c. 1: pla'ttousin
   heautois kai` bi'blous epipla'stous,

   [47] Even the great anti-gnostic teachers had come to this view (see
   Vol. II., p. 304) without indeed drawing the consequences which the
   Theodotians may have deduced more certainly.

   [48] L.c. Dei hemas to Melchisedek prospherein, phasin, hina di' autou
   prosenechthe huper hemon, kai heuromen di' autou zoen.

   [49] See Clem. Alex. Strom. IV. 25. 161; Hierakas in Epiph. H. 55, c.
   5, H. 67, c. 3; Philast. H. 148. Epiph. has himself to confess (H. 55,
   c. 7), that even in his time the view to be taken of Melchizedek was
   still a subject of dispute among Catholic Christians: hoi men gar auton
   nomizousi phusei ton huion tou Theou en idea anthropou tote to Abraam
   pephenenai. Jerome Ep. 73 is important. The Egyptian hermit, Marcus,
   wrote, about A.D. 400, an independent work eis to`n Melchisede`k kata`
   Melchisedekeion, i.e., against those who saw in Melchizedek a
   manifestation of the true Son of God (see Photius, Biblioth. 200; Dict.
   of Christ. Biog. III. p. 827; Herzog's R. E., 2 Aufl. IX. p. 290); cf.
   the above described fragment, edited for the first time by Caspari;
   further Theodoret H. F. II. 6, Timotheus Presb. in Cotelier, Monum.
   Eccl. Gr√¶c√¶ III. p. 392 etc.

   [51] Cf. the striking agreement with Sim. V., especially ch. VI. 3:
   autos katharisas tas hamartias tou laou edeixen autois tas tribous tes
   zoes.

   [52] The theologico-philosophical impress which, as distinguished from
   Sim. V., marks the whole passage, is of course unmistakable. Notice
   what is said as to Paul, and the expression "mustai".

   [53] The Theodotians seem to have taken Christ in this verse to mean
   not Jesus, but the Holy Spirit, the eternal. Son of God, deleting the
   name Jesus (Epiph. H. 55, ch. 9). If that is so then the Philosophumena
   is right when it relates that the Theodotians had also given the name
   of Christ to the pre-existent Son of God, the Holy Ghost. Yet it is not
   certain whether we should regard the above quoted chapter of Epiphanius
   at all as reporting the Theodotian interpretation of 1 Cor. VIII. 6.

   [54] Epiph. H. 55, ch. 8: eis onoma de toutou tou Melchisedek he

   [55] See my art. in Herzog R. E., 2 Aufl. VI. p. 100 (Epiph. LV. 5;
   LXVII. 3).

   [56] Hermas did not do this, in so far as in the language of religion
   he speaks only of a Son of God (Simil. IX.).

   [57] Euseb. H. E. V. 28. 3: phasi gar tous men proterous hapantas kai
   autous tous apostolous, pareilephenai te kai dedidachenai tauta, ha nun
   houtoi legousi, kai teteresthai ten aletheian tou kerugmatos mechri ton

   parakecharachthai ten aletheian.

   [58] Euseb. H. E. V. 28. 4, 5.

   [59] We know that he still lived about 270 from tile document of the
   Synod of Antioch in the case of Paul of Samosata. We read there (Euseb.
   H. E. VII. 30. 17): "Paul may write letters to Artemas and the
   followers of A. are said to hold communion with him." We have probably
   to regard as Artemonites those unnamed persons, mentioned in Novatian
   De Trinitate, who explained Jesus to be a mere man (homo nudus et
   solitarius). Artemas is also named in Methodius Conviv. VIII. 10, Ed.
   Jahn, p. 37.

   [60] Even Tertullian used the Christological formula of Hermas when he
   was not engaged in Apologetics or in polemics against the Gnostics.

   [61] Hartel, Opp. Cypr. III., p. 104 sq.

   [62] Hilary's work "De trinitate" also shows (esp. X. 18 ff., 50 ff.)
   what different Christologies still existed in the West in the middle of
   the 4th century. There were some who maintained: "quod in eo ex virgine
   creando efficax dei sapientia et virtus exstiterit, et in nativitate
   eius divin√¶ prudenti√¶ et potestatis opus intellegatur, sitque in eo
   efficientia potius quam natura sapienti√¶.

   [63] Augustine, l.c. . . . Quia itaque vera scripta sunt (sc. the Holy
   Scriptures) totum hominem in Christo agnoscebam; non corpus tantum
   hominis, aut cum corpore sine mente animam, sed ipsum hominem, non
   persona veritatis, sed magna quadam nature√¶ human√¶ excellentia et
   perfectiore participatione sapienti√¶ pr√¶ferri c√¶teris arbitrabar.
   Alypius autem deum carne indutum ita putabat credi a Catholicis, ut
   pr√¶ter deum et carnem non esset in Christo anima, mentemque hominis non
   existimabat in eo pr√¶dicari . . . Sed postea h√¶reticorum
   Apollinaristarum hunc errorem esse cognoscens, catholic√¶ fidei
   coll√¶tatus et contemperatus est. Ego autem aliquanto posterius
   didicisse me fateor, in eo quod "verbum caro factum est" quomodo
   catholica veritas a Photini falsitate dirimatur.

   [64] In the Fragment, only preserved in Arabic, of a letter of Pope
   Innocent I. to Severianus, Bishop of Gabala (Mai, Spicile.g. Rom. III.,
   p. 702) we still read the warning: "Let no one believe that it was only
   at the time when the divine Word on earth came to receive baptism from
   John that this divine nature originated, when, i.e., John heard the
   voice of the Father from heaven. It was certainly not so, etc."

   [65] Orig. on John II. 2, Lomm. I., p. 92: Kai to pollous philotheous

   in Mai (Nov. Coll. VII. 1, p. 171) speaks of men who conceived Christ
   as being filled with divinity', but made no specific distinction
   between Him and the prophets, and worshipped a man with divine power
   after the manner of the heathens.

   carnalem substantialiter et proprie non exstiterit, sed quod homo natus
   patris solam in se habuerit deitatem, ne illos quidem sine periculo est
   ecclesi√¶ numero sociari." This passage, undoubtedly, need not
   necessarily be applied to Dynamistic Monarchians, any more than the
   description about to be quoted of the doctrine of Beryll. There may
   have existed a middle type between Dynamistic and Modalistic
   Monarchianism, according to which the humanity as well as the deitas
   patris in Jesus Christ was held to be personal.

   [70] L.c.: ton sotera kai kurion hemon me prouphestanai kat' idian
   ousias perigraphen pro tes eis anthropous epidemias, mede theoteta
   idian echein, all empoliteuomenen auto monen ten patriken. The word
   perigraphe is first found in the Excerpta Theodoti 19, where kata
   perigraphen is contrasted in the sense of personality with the kat'
   ousian (tou Theou)). The latter was accordingly felt to be Modalistic:
   kai ho logos sarx egeneto, ou kata ten parousian monon anthropos
   genomenos, alla kai en arche ho en tautoteti logos kata perigraphen kai
   ou kat' ousian genomenos, ho huios; cf., ch. 10, where perigraphesthai
   also expresses the personal existence, i.e., what was afterwards termed
   hupostasis. This word was not yet so used, so far as I know, in the 3rd
   century. In Origen perigraphe is likewise the expression for the
   strictly self-contained personality; see Comm. on John I. 42, Lomm. I.
   88: hosper oun dunameis Theou pleiones eisin, hon hekaste kata
   perigraphen, hon diapherei ho soter, houtos ho logos -- ei kai par'
   hemin ouk esti kata perigraphen ektos hemon -- noethesetai ho Christos
   k.t.l. In our passage and Pseudo-Hippol. c. Beron. 1, 4, it means
   simply "configuration".

   [73] Euseb. H. E. VII. 24, 5. By the Epiphany we have to understand the
   future appearing; but thorough-going Millenarians in the East, in the
   country districts, hardly recognised the doctrine of the Logos.

   [74] The uncertainty which still prevailed in the 3rd century in
   reference to Christology is seen whenever we take up works not written
   by learned theologians. Especially the circumstance that, according to
   the Creed and the Gospel, the Holy Ghost took part in the conception of
   Jesus, constantly prompted the most curious phrases regarding the
   personal divinity of Christ, and the assumptio carnis of the Logos,
   see, e.g., Orac. Sibyll. VI. V. 6, where Christ is called "Sweet God
   whom the Spirit, in the white plumage of the dove, begot."

   [78] The most important authorities for Paul's history and doctrine are
   the Acts of the Synod of Antioch held against him, i.e., the shorthand
   report of the discussion between Paul and Malchion, and the Synodal
   epistle. These still existed in the 6th century, but we now possess
   them only in a fragmentary form: in Euseb. H. E. VII. 27-30 (Jerome de
   vir. inl. 71); in Justinian's Tract. c. Monophys.; in the Contestatio
   ad Clerum C.P.; in the Acts of the Ephesian Council; in the writing
   against Nestor. and Eutych. by Leontius of Byzant.; and in the book of
   Petrus Diaconus, "De incarnat. ad Fulgentium": all in Routh l.c. where
   the places in which they are found are also stated. Not certainly
   genuine is the Synodal epistle of six Bishops to Paul, published by
   Turrianus (Routh, l.c., p. 289 sq.); yet its authenticity is supported
   by overwhelming reasons. Decidedly inauthentic is a letter of Dionysius
   of Alex. to Paul (Mansi, I., p. 1039 sq.), also a pretended Nicene
   Creed against him (Caspari, Quellen IV., p. 161 f.), and another found
   in the libel against Nestorius (Mansi, IV., p. 1010). Mai has published
   (Vet. Script. Nova Coll. VII., p. 68 sq.) five fragments of Paul's
   speeches: hoi pro's Sabinon lo'goi (not quite correctly printed in
   Routh, l.c., p. 328 sq.) which are of the highest value, and may be
   considered genuine, in spite of their standing in the very worst
   company, and of many doubts being roused by them which do not admit of
   being completely silenced. Vincentius mentions writings by Paul
   (Commonit. 35). In the second grade we have the testimony of the great
   Church Fathers of the 4th century, which rested partly on the Acts,
   partly on oral tradition: see, Athanas c. Apoll. II. 3, IX. 3; de
   Synod. Arim. et Seleuc. 26, 43-45, 51, 93; Orat. c. Arian. II., No. 43;
   Hilarius, De synod. ¬ß¬ß 81, 86, pp. 1196, 1200; Ephr√¶m Junior in
   Photius, Cod. 229; Gregor Nyss, Antirrhet. adv. Apoll., ¬ß 9, p. 141;
   Basilius, ep. 52 (formerly 300); Epiphan. H. 65 and Anaceph.; cf. also
   the 3 Antiochian formulas and the Form. Macrostich. (Hahn Biblioth. der
   Symbole, 2 Aufl. ¬ß¬ß 85, 89), as also the 19 Canon of the Council of
   Nic√¶a, according to which Paul's followers were to be re-baptised
   before reception into the Catholic Church. One or two notes also in
   Cramer Catena on S. John. pp. 235, 259 sq. Useful details are given by
   Innocentius I., ep. 22; by Marius Mercator, in the Suppl. Imp. Theodos.
   et Valentinian adv. Nestor. of the Deacon Basilius; by Theodorus of
   Raithu (see Routh, l.c., pp. 327 sq. 357); Fulgentius, etc. In the
   later opponents of the heretics from Philaster, and in resolutions of
   Synods from the 5th century, we find nothing new. Sozom. H. E. IV. 15
   and Theodoret H. F. II. 8 are still of importance. The Libellus
   Synodicus we must leave out of account.

   [91] Paul has even spoken of a diaphora tes kataskeues (sustaseos) tou
   Christou.

   [92] From this point we refer to the Logoi pros Sabinon of Paul. We
   give them here on account of their unique importance: (1) To hagio
   pneumati christheis prosegoreuthe Christos, paschon kata phusin,
   thaumatourgon kata charin; to gar atrepto tes gnomes homoiotheis to

   mian; ton pollon kai ten auten ergazetai thelesin dia mias kai tes
   autes phaneroumenen euaresteseos. Similar details are to be found in
   Theodorus of Mops.; but the genuineness of what is given here seems to
   me to be guaranteed by the fact that there is absolutely not a word of
   an ethical unification of the eternal Son of God (the Logos) with
   Jesus. It is God Himself Himself who is thus united with the latter.

   [93] Chre de gignoskein, we read in the Catena S. Joh., hoti ho men

   distinction between the Logos and Jesus: to`n lo'gon ape'steilen tois
   huiois Israe`l euangelizo'menos eire'nen dia` Iesou Christou They said
   that there was a distinction here like that in the O. T. between the

   [103] The three fragments of "Ebion" given by Mai, l.c., p. 68, and
   strangely held by Hilgenfeld to be genuine (Ketzergeschichte, p. 437
   f.), seem to me likewise to belong to Paul: at any rate they correspond
   to his doctrine: Ek tes peri propheton exegeseos (1) Kat' epangeleian

   [109] Dorner's view (l.c. I. p.513) is impossible because resting on a
   false interpretation of the word homoousios; Paul held the Father and
   Jesus to be homoousioi in so far as they were persons, and therefore
   the Synod condemned the term.

   [115] The propositions are undoubtedly as a rule phrased biblically,

   by the learned exegesis of the Alexandrian which certainly was
   extremely closely allied with philosophical speculation.

   [120] See esp. Athanas. c. Arian I. 5. "Arius says that there are two

   through this the Son arose and by participation in it he was simply
   named Word and Wisdom; for wisdom, he says, originated through wisdom
   according to the will of the wise God. Then he also says that there is
   another Word apart from the Son in God, and through participation
   therein the Son himself has been again named graciously Word and Son."
   This is the doctrine of Paul of Samos., taken over by Arius from
   Lucian. On the distinction see above.

   [123] We have to compare also the treatises of Aphraates, written
   shortly before the middle of the 4th century. He adheres to the
   designation of Christ as Logos according to John I. 1; but it is very
   striking that in our Persian author there is not even the slightest
   allusion in which one could perceive an echo of the Arian controversies
   (Bickell, Ausgew√§hlte Schriften der syr. Kirchenv√§ter 1874, p. 15). See
   tract 1, "On faith", and 17, "Proof that Christ is the Son of God."

   [124] On the origin of the Acta Archelai see my Texte und Unters. I. 3,
   137 ff. The principal passages are to be found in ch. 49 and 50. In
   these the Churchman disputes the view of Mani, that Jesus was a spirit,
   the eternal Son of God, perfect by nature. "Dic mihi, super quem
   spiritus sanctus sicut columba descendit? Si perfectus erat, si filius
   erat, si virtus erat, non poterat spiritus ingredi, sicut nec regnum
   potest ingredi intra regnum. Cuius autem ei c√¶litus emissa vox
   testimonium detulit dicens: Hic est filius meus dilectus, in quo bene
   complacui? Dic age nihil remoreris, quis ille est, qui parat h√¶c omnia,
   qui agit universa? Responde itane blasphemiam pro ratione impudenter
   allegas, et inferre conaris?" The following Christology is put in the
   lips of Mani: "Mihi pium videtur dicere, quod nihil eguerit filius dei
   in eo quod adventus eius procuratur ad terras, neque opus habuerit
   columba, neque baptismate, neque matre, neque fratribus." On the other
   hand Mani says in reference to the Church views: "Si enim hominem eum
   tantummodo ex Maria esse dicis et in baptismate spiritum percepisse,
   ergo per profectum filius videbitur et non per naturam. Si tamen tibi
   concedam dicere, secundum profectum esse filium quasi hominem factum,
   hominem vere esse opinaris, id est, qui caro et sanguis sit?" In what
   follows Archelaus says: "Quomodo poterit vera columba verum hominem
   ingredi atque in eo permanere, caro enim carnem ingredi non potest? sed
   magis si Iesum hominem verum confiteamur, eum vero, qui dicitur, sicut
   columba, Spiritum Sanctum, salva est nobis ratio in utraque. Spiritus
   enim secundum rectam rationem habitat in homine, et descendit et
   permanet et competenter hoc et factum est et fit semper . . . Descendit
   spiritus super hominem dignum se . . . Poterat dominus in c√¶lo positus
   facere qu√¶ voluerat, si spiritum eum esse et non hominem dices. Sed non
   ita est, quoniam exinanivit semetipsum formam servi accipiens. Dico
   autem de eo, qui ex Maria factus est homo. Quid enim? non poteramus et
   nos multo facilius et lautius ista narrare? sed absit, ut a veritate
   declinemus iota unum aut unum apicem. Est enim qui de Maria natus est
   filius, qui totum hoc quod magnum est, voluit perferre certamen Iesus.
   Hic est Christus dei, qui descendit super eum, qui de Maria est . . .
   Statim (post baptismum) in desertum a Spiritu ductus est Iesus, quem
   cum diabolus ignoraret, dicebat ei: Si filius est dei. Ignorabat autem
   propter quid genuisset filium dei (scil. Spiritus), qui pr√¶dicabat
   regnum c√¶lorum, quod erat habitaculum magnum, nec ab ullo alio parari
   potuisset; unde et affixus cruci cum resurrexisset ab inferis,
   assumptus est illuc, ubi Christus filius dei regnabat . . . Sicut enim
   Paracleti pondus nullus alius valuit sustinere nisi soli discipuli et
   Paulus beatus, ita etiam spiritum, qui de c√¶lis descenderat, per quem
   vox paterna testatur dicens: Hic est filius meus dilectus, nullus alius
   portare pr√¶valuit, nisi qui ex Maria natus est super omnes sanctos
   Iesus." It is noteworthy that the author (in ch. 37) ranks Sabellius as
   a heretic with Valentinus, Marcion, and Tatian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3. Expulsion of Modalistic Monarchianism.

   (a). The Modalistic Monarchians in Asia Minor and in the West: No√´tus,
   Epigonus, Cleomenes, Aeschines, Praxeas, Victorinus (Victor),
   Zephyrinus, Sabellius, Callistus. [125]

   The really dangerous opponent of the Logos Christology in the period
   between A.D. 180 and 300 was not Adoptianism, but the doctrine which
   saw the deity himself incarnate in Christ, and conceived Christ to be
   God in a human body, the Father become flesh. Against this view the
   great Doctors of the Church -- Tertullian, Origen, Novatian, but above
   all, Hippolytus -- had principally to fight. Its defenders were called
   by Tertullian "Monarchiani", and, not altogether correctly,
   "Patripassiani" which afterwards became the usual names in the West
   (see e.g., Cypr., Ep. 73. 4). In the East they were all designated,
   after the famous head of the school, "Sabelliani" from the second half
   of the third century; yet the name of "Patripassiani" was not quite
   unknown there also. [126] Hippolytus tells us in the Philosophumena,
   that at that time the Monarchian controversy agitated the whole Church,
   [127] and Tertullian and Origen testified, that in their day the
   "economic" trinity, and the technical application of the conception of
   the Logos to Christ, were regarded by the mass of Christians with
   suspicion. [128] Modalism, as we now know from the Philosoph., was for
   almost a generation the official theory in Rome. That it was not an
   absolute novelty can be proved; [129] but it is very probable, on the
   other hand, that a Modalistic doctrine, which sought to exclude every
   other, only existed from the end of the second century. It was in
   opposition to Gnosticism that the first effort was made to fix
   theologically the formulas of a na√Øve Modalism, and that these were
   used to confront the Logos Christology in order (1) to avert Ditheism,
   (2) to maintain the complete divinity of Christ, and (3) to prevent the
   attacks of Gnosticism. An attempt was also made, however, to prove
   Modalism by exegesis. That is equivalent to saying that this form of
   doctrine, which was embraced by the great majority of Christians, [130]
   was supported by scientific authorities, from the end of the second
   century. But it can be shown without difficulty, how hurtful any
   contact with theology could not fail to be to the na√Øve conception of
   the incarnation of the deity in Christ, and we may say that it was all
   over with it -- though of course the death-struggle lasted long -- when
   it found itself compelled to attack others or to defend itself. When it
   required to clothe itself in a cloak manufactured by a scientific
   theology, and to reflect on the idea of God, it belied its own nature,
   and lost its raison d'√™tre. What it still retained was completely
   distorted by its opponents. Hippolytus has in the Philosophumena
   represented the doctrine of No√´tus to have been borrowed from
   Heraclitus. That is, of course, an exaggeration. But once we grasp the
   whole problem "philosophically and scientifically" -- and it was so
   understood even by some scientific defenders of Monarchianism -- then
   it undoubtedly resembles strikingly the controversy regarding the idea
   of God between the genuine Stoics and the Platonists. As the latter set
   the transcendent, apathetic God of Plato above the logos-theos of
   Heraclitus and the Stoics, so Origen, e.g., has charged the Monarchians
   especially with stopping short at the God manifest, and at work, in the
   world, instead of advancing to the "ultimate" God, and thus
   apprehending the deity "economically". Nor can it surprise us that
   Modalistic Monarchianism, after some of its representatives had
   actually summoned science, i.e., the Stoa, to their assistance, moved
   in the direction of a pantheistic conception of God. But this does not
   seem to have happened at the outset, or to the extent assumed by the
   opponents of the school. Not to speak of its uncultured adherents, the
   earliest literary defenders of Modalism were markedly monotheistic, and
   had a real interest in Biblical Christianity. It marks the character of
   the opposition, however, that they at once scented the God of
   Heraclitus and Zeno -- a proof of how deeply they themselves were
   involved in Neo-platonic theology. [131] As it was in Asia Minor that
   Adoptianism first entered into conflict with the Logos Christology, so
   the Church of Asia Minor seems to have been the scene of the first
   Modalistic controversy, while in both cases natives of that country
   transferred the dispute to Rome.

   It is possible that No√´tus was not excommunicated till about A.D. 230,
   and, even if we cannot now discover his date more accurately, it seems
   to be certain that he first excited attention as a Monarchian, and
   probably in the last twenty years of the second century. This was
   perhaps in Smyrna, [132] his native place, perhaps in Ephesus. [133] He
   was excommunicated in Asia Minor, only after the whole controversy had,
   comparatively speaking, come to a close in Rome. [134] This explains
   why Hippolytus has mentioned him last in his great work against the
   Monarchians, while in the Philosoph. he describes him as the originator
   (IX. 6: archegon) of the heresy. [135] A disciple of his, Epigonus,
   came to Rome in the time of Zephyrinus, or shortly before (+ 200), and
   is said to have there diffused the teaching of his master, and to have
   formed a separate party of Patripassians. At first Cleomenes, the
   disciple of Epigonus, was regarded as the head of the sect, and then,
   from c. A.D. 215, Sabellius. Against these there appeared, in the Roman
   Church, especially the presbyter Hippolytus, who sought to prove that
   the doctrine promulgated by them was a revolutionary error. But the
   sympathies of the vast majority of the Roman Christians, so far as they
   could take any part in the dispute, were on the side of the
   Monarchians, and even among the clergy only a minority supported
   Hippolytus. The "uneducated" Bishop Zephyrine, advised by the prudent
   Callistus, was himself disposed, like Victor, his predecessor (see
   under), to the Modalistic views; but his main effort seems to have been
   to calm the contending parties, and at any cost to avoid a new schism
   in the Roman Church, already sadly split up. After his death the same
   policy was continued by Callistus (217-222), now raised to the
   Bishopric. But as the schools now attacked each other more violently,
   and an agreement was past hoping for, the Bishop determined to
   excommunicate both Sabellius and Hippolytus, the two heads of the
   contending factions. [136] The Christological formula, which Callistus
   himself composed, was meant to satisfy the less passionate adherents of
   both parties, and this it did, so far as we may conjecture. The small
   party of Hippolytus "the true Catholic Church", held its ground in Rome
   for only about fifteen years, that of Sabellius probably longer. The
   formula of Callistus was the bridge, on which the Roman Christians, who
   were originally favourable to Monarchianism, passed over to the
   recognition of the Logos Christology, following the trend of the times,
   and the science of the Church. This doctrine must have already been the
   dominant theory in Rome when Novatian wrote his work De Trinitate, and
   from that date it was never ousted thence. It had been established in
   the Capital by a politician, who, for his own part, and so far as he
   took any interest at all in dogmatics, had been more inclined to the
   Modalistic theory. [137]

   The scantiness of our sources for the history of Monarchianism in Rome,
   -- not to speak of other cities -- in spite of the discovery of the
   Philosophumena, is shown most clearly by the circumstance that
   Tertullian has not mentioned the names of No√´tus, Epigonus, Cleomenes,
   or Callistus; on the other hand, he has introduced a Roman Monarchian,
   Praxeas, whose name is not mentioned by Hippolytus in any of his
   numerous controversial writings. This fact has seemed so remarkable
   that very hazardous hypotheses have been set up to explain it. It has
   been thought that "Praxeas" is a nickname (= tradesman), and that by it
   we ought really to understand No√´tus, [138] Epigonus, [139] or
   Callistus. [140] The correct view is to be found in D√∂llinger [141] and
   Lipsius. [142] Praxeas [143] had come to Rome before Epigonus, at a
   date anterior to the earliest of Hippolytus' personal recollections,
   accordingly about contemporaneously with Theodotus, or a little
   earlier, while Victor was Bishop; according to Lipsius, and this is
   probable, even during the episcopate of Eleutherus. [144] He probably
   resided only a short time in Rome, where he met with no opposition; and
   he founded no school in the city. When, twenty years afterwards, the
   controversy was at its height in Rome and Carthage, and Tertullian
   found himself compelled to enter the lists against Patripassianism, the
   name of Praxeas was almost forgotten. Tertullian, however, laid hold of
   him because Praxeas had been the first to raise a discussion in
   Carthage also, and because he had an antipathy to Praxeas who was a
   decided anti-montanist. In his attack, Tertullian has, however,
   reviewed the historical circumstances of about the year A.D. 210, when
   his work Adv. Prax. was written; nay, he manifestly alludes to the
   Roman Monarchians, i.e., to Zephyrinus and those protected by him. This
   observation contains what truth there is in the hypothesis that Praxeas
   is only a name for another well-known Roman Monarchian.

   Praxeas was a confessor of Asia Minor, and the first to bring the
   dispute as to the Logos Christology to Rome. [145] At the same time he
   brought from his birth-place a resolute zeal against the new prophecy.
   We are here, again, reminded of the faction of Alogi of Asia Minor who
   combined with the rejection of the Logos Christology an aversion from
   Montanism; cf. also the Roman presbyter Caius. Not only did his efforts
   meet with no opposition in Rome, but Praxeas induced the Bishop, by
   giving him information as to the new prophets and their communities in
   Asia, to recall the litter√¶ pacis, which he had already sent them, and
   to aid in expelling the Paraclete. [146] If this Bishop was Eleutherus,
   and that is probable from Euseb. H. E. V. 4, then we have four Roman
   Bishops in succession who declared themselves in favour of the
   Modalistic Christology, viz., Eleutherus, Victor, Zephyrine, and
   Callistus; for we learn from PseudoTertullian that Victor took the part
   of Praxeas. [147] But it is also possible that Victor was the Bishop
   whom Tertullian (Adv. Prax.) was thinking of, and in that case
   Eleutherus has no place here. It is at all events certain that when
   Dynamistic Monarchianism was proscribed by Victor, it was expelled not
   by a defender of the Logos Christology, but in the interests of a
   Modalistic Christology. The labours of Praxeas did not yet bring about
   a controversy in Rome with the Logos Doctrine; he was merely the
   forerunner of Epigonus and Cleomenes there. From Rome he betook himself
   to Carthage, [148] and strove against the assumption of any distinction
   between God and Christ. But he was resisted by Tertullian, who, at that
   time, still belonged to the Catholic Church, and he was silenced, and
   even compelled to make a written recantation. With this ended the first
   phase of the dispute. [149] The name of Praxeas does not again occur.
   But it was only several years afterwards that the controversy became
   really acute in Rome and Carthage, and caused Tertullian to write his
   polemical work. [150] Of the final stages of Monarchianism in Carthage
   and Africa we know nothing certain. Yet see under.

   It is not possible, from the state of our sources, to give a complete
   and homogeneous description of the doctrine of the older Modalistic
   Monarchianism. But the sources are not alone to blame for this. As soon
   as the thought that God Himself was incarnate in Christ had to be
   construed theologically, very various attempts could not fail to
   result. These could lead, and so far did lead, on the one hand, to
   hazardous conceptions involving transformation, and, on the other,
   almost to the border of Adoptianism; for, as soon as the indwelling of
   the deity of the Father (deitas patris) in Jesus was not grasped in the
   strict sense as an incarnation, as soon as the element that in Jesus
   constituted his personality was not exclusively perceived in the deity
   of the Father, these Christians were treading the ground of the
   Artemonite heresy. Hippolytus also charged Callistus with wavering
   between Sabellius and Theodotus, [151] and in his work against No√´tus
   he alludes (ch. III.) to a certain affinity between the latter and the
   leather-worker. In the writings of Origen, moreover, several passages
   occur, regarding which it will always be uncertain whether they refer
   to Modalists or Adoptians. Nor can this astonish us, for Monarchians of
   all shades had a common interest in opposition to the Logos
   Christology: they represented the conception of the Person of Christ
   founded on the history of salvation, as against one based on the
   history of his nature.

   Among the different expositions of the doctrine of the older Modalists
   that of Hippolytus in his work against No√´tus shows us it in its
   simplest form. The Monarchians there described are introduced to us as
   those who taught that Christ is the Father himself, and that the Father
   was born, suffered and died. [152] If Christ is God, then he is
   certainly the Father, or he would not be God. If Christ, accordingly,
   truly suffered, then the God, who is God alone, suffered. [153] But
   they were not only influenced by a decided interest in Monotheism,
   [154] a cause which they held to have been injured by their opponents,
   [155] whom they called ditheists (di'theoi), but they fought in behalf
   of the complete deity of Jesus, which, in their opinion, could only be
   upheld by their doctrine. [156] In support of the latter they appealed,
   like the Theodotians, chiefly to the Holy Scriptures, and, indeed, to
   the Catholic Canon; thus they quoted Exod. III. 6, XX. 2f.; Isa. XLIV.
   6, XLV. 5, 14 f.; Baruch. III. 36; John. X. 30, XIV. 8f.; Rom. IX. 5.
   Even John's Gospel is recognised; but this is qualified by the most
   important piece of information which Hippolytus has given about their
   exposition of the Scriptures. They did not regard that book as
   justifying the introduction of a Logos, and the bestowal on him of the
   title Son of God. The prologue of the Gospel, as well as, in general,
   so many passages in the book, was to be understood allegorically. [157]
   The use of the category of the Logos was accordingly emphatically
   rejected in their theology. We do not learn any more about the No√´tians
   here. But in the Philosoph. Hippolytus has discussed their conception
   of God, and has presented it as follows: [158] They say that one and
   the same God was creator and Father of all things; that he in his
   goodness appeared to the righteous of olden times, although he is
   invisible; in other words, when he is not seen, he is invisible, but
   when he permits himself to be seen, he is visible; he is
   incomprehensible, when he wills not to be apprehended, comprehensible
   when he permits himself to be apprehended. So in the same way he is
   invincible and to be overcome, unbegotten and begotten, immortal and
   mortal." Hippolytus continues: "No√´tus says, So far, therefore, as the
   Father was not made, he is appropriately called Father; but in so far
   as he passively submitted to be born, he is by birth the Son, not of
   another, but of himself.'" In this way he meant to establish the
   Monarchia, and to say that he who was called Father and Son, was one
   and the same, not one proceeding from the other, but he himself from
   himself; he is distinguished in name as Father and Son, according to
   the change of dispensations; but it is one and the same who appeared in
   former times, and submitted to be born of the virgin, and walked as man
   among men. He confessed himself, on account of his birth, to be the Son
   to those who saw him, but he did not conceal the truth that he was the
   Father from those who were able to apprehend it. [159] Cleomenes and
   his party maintain that "he who was nailed to the cross, who committed
   his spirit to himself, who died and did not die, who raised himself on
   the third day and rested in the grave, who was pierced with the lance
   and fastened with nails, was the God and Father of all." The
   distinction between Father and Son was accordingly nominal; yet it was
   to this extent more than nominal, that the one God, in being born man,
   appeared as Son; it was real, so far, from the point of view of the
   history of salvation. In support of the identity of the "manifested"
   and the invisible, these Monarchians referred to the O. T. theophanies,
   with as good a right as, nay, with a better than, the defenders of the
   Logos Christology. Now as regards the idea of God, it has been said
   that "the element of finitude was here potentially placed in God
   himself," and that these Monarchians were influenced by Stoicism, etc.
   While the former statement is probably unwarranted, the Stoic
   influence, on the contrary, is not to be denied. [160] But the
   foundation to which we have to refer them consists of two ancient
   liturgical formulas, used by Ignatius, the author of the II. Ep. of
   Clement, and Melito, [161] whom we include, although he wrote a work
   "Concerning the creation and genesis of Christ" (peri ktiseos kai
   geneseos Christou). Further, even Ignatius, although he held Christ to
   have been pre-existent, knew only of one birth of the Son, namely, that
   of God from the virgin. [162] We have here to recognise the conception,
   according to which, God, in virtue of his own resolve to become finite,
   capable of suffering etc., can and did decide to be man, without giving
   up his divinity. It is the old, religious, and artless Modalism, which
   has here been raised, with means furnished by the Stoa, to a
   theological doctrine, and has become exclusive. But in the use of the
   formula "the Father has suffered," we have undoubtedly an element of
   novelty; for it cannot be indicated in the post-apostolic age. It is
   very questionable, however, whether it was ever roundly uttered by the
   theological defenders of Modalism. They probably merely said that "the
   Son, who suffered, is the same with the Father."

   We do not learn what conception these Monarchians formed of the human
   sarx (flesh) of Jesus, or what significance they attached to it. Even
   the Monarchian formulas, opposed by Tertullian in "Adv. Prax", and
   attributed to Callistus by Hippolytus, are already more complicated. We
   easily perceive that they were coined in a controversy in which the
   theological difficulties inherent in the Modalistic doctrine had become
   notorious. Tertullian's Monarchians still cling strongly to the perfect
   identity of the Father and Son; [163] they refuse to admit the Logos
   into their Christology; for the "word" is no substance, but merely a
   "sound"; [164] they are equally interested with the No√´tians in
   monotheism, [165] though not so evidently in the full divinity of
   Christ; like them they dread the return of Gnosticism; [166] they hold
   the same view as to the invisibility and visibility of God; [167] they
   appeal to the Holy Scriptures, sometimes to the same passages as the
   opponents of Hippolytus; [168] but they find themselves compelled to
   adapt their teaching to those proof-texts in which the Son is
   contrasted, as a distinctive subject, with the Father. This they did,
   not only by saying that God made himself Son by assuming a body, [169]
   or that the Son proceeded from himself [170] -- for with God nothing is
   impossible: [171] but they distinctly declared that the flesh changed
   the Father into the Son; or even that in the person of the Redeemer the
   body (the man, Jesus) was the Son, but that the Spirit (God, Christ)
   was the Father. [172] For this they appealed to Luke I. 35. They
   conceived the Holy Spirit to be identical with the power of the
   Almighty, i.e., with the Father himself, and they emphasised the fact
   that that which was born, accordingly the flesh, not the Spirit, was to
   be called Son of God. [173] The Spirit (God) was not capable of
   suffering, but since he entered into the flesh, he sympathised in the
   suffering. The Son suffered, [174] but the Father "sympathised" [175]
   -- this being a Stoic expression. Therefore Tertullian says (ch. 23),
   "Granting that we would thus say, as you assert, that there were two
   separate (gods), it was more tolerable to affirm two separate (gods)
   than one dissembling (turn-coat) god" [Ut sic divisos diceremus,
   quomodo iactitatis, tolerabilius erat, duos divisos quam unum deum
   versipellem pr√¶dicare].

   It is very evident that whenever the distinction between caro (filius)
   and spiritus (pater), between the flesh or Son and the Spirit or
   Father, is taken seriously, the doctrine approximates to the Artemonite
   idea. It is in fact changing its coat (versipellis). But it is obvious
   that even in this form it could not satisfy the defenders of the Logos
   Christology, for the personal identity between the Father and the
   Spirit or Christ is still retained. On the whole, every attempt made by
   Modalism to meet the demands of the Logos doctrine could not fail
   logically to lead to Dynamistic Monarchianism. We know definitely that
   the formulas of Zephyrine and Callistus arose out of attempts at a
   compromise, [176] though the charge of having two gods was raised
   against Hippolytus and his party. Zephyrine's thesis (IX. 11), "I know
   one God, Christ Jesus, and besides him no other born and suffering,"
   which he announced with the limiting clause, "the Father did not die,
   but the Son," [177] agrees with the doctrines of "Praxeas", but, as is
   clear from the Philos., is also to be understood as a formula of
   compromise. Callistus went still further. He found it advisable after
   the excommunication of Sabellius and Hippolytus, to receive the
   category of the Logos into the Christological formula meant to
   harmonise all parties, an act for which he was especially abused by
   Hippolytus, while Sabellius also accused him of apostasy. [178]
   According to Zephyrine: God is in himself an indivisible Pneuma, which
   fills all things, or, in other words, the Logos; as Logos he is
   nominally two, Father and Son. The Pneuma, become flesh in the virgin,
   is thus in essence not different from, but identical with, the Father
   (John XIV. 11). He who became manifest, i.e., the man, is the Son, but
   the Spirit, which entered into the Son, is the Father. "For the Father,
   who is in the Son, deified the flesh, after he had assumed it, and
   united it with himself, and established a unity of such a nature that
   now Father and Son are called one God, and that henceforth it is
   impossible that this single person can be divided into two; rather the
   thesis holds true that the Father suffered in sympathy with the Son" --
   not the Father suffered. [179]

   Hippolytus discovered in this formula a mixture of Sabellian and
   Theodotian ideas, and he was right. [180] The approximation to the
   Christology founded on the doctrine of substances (hypostases), and the
   departure from the older Monarchianism, are, in fact, only brought
   about by Callistus having also made use of a Theodotian idea. [181] He
   still kept aloof from the Platonic conception of God; nay, it sounds
   like a reminiscence of Stoicism, when, in order to obtain a rational
   basis for the incarnation, he refers to the Pneuma (Spirit) which fills
   the universe, the upper and under world. But the fact that his
   formulas, in spite of this, could render valuable service in Rome in
   harmonising different views, was not only due to their admission of the
   Logos conception. It was rather a result of the thought expressed in
   them, that God in becoming incarnate had deified the flesh, and that
   the Son, in so far as he represented the essentially deified sarx, was
   to be conceived as a second person, and yet as one really united with
   God. [182] At this point the ultimate Catholic interest in the
   Christology comes correctly to light, and this is an interest not
   clearly perceptible elsewhere in Monarchian theories. It was thus that
   men were gradually tranquillised in Rome, and only the few extremists
   of the Left and Right parties offered any resistance. Moreover, the
   formula was extraordinarily adapted, by its very vagueness, to set up
   among the believing people the religious Mystery, under whose
   protection the Logos Christology gradually made good its entrance.

   The latter was elaborated in opposition to Modalism by Tertullian,
   Hippolytus, and Novatian in the West. [183] While Adoptianism
   apparently played a very small part in the development of the Logos
   Christology in the Church, the Christological theses of Tertullian and
   the rest were completely dependent on the opposition to the Modalists.
   [184] This reveals itself especially in the strict subordination of the
   Son to the Father. It was only by such a subordination that it was
   possible to repel the charge, made by opponents, of teaching that there
   were two Gods. The philosophical conception of God implied in the Logos
   theory was now set up definitely as the doctrine of the Church, and was
   construed to mean that the unity of God was simply to be understood as
   a "unicum imperium", which God could cause to be administered by his
   chosen officials. Further, the attempt was made to prove that
   Monotheism was satisfactorily guarded by the Father remaining the sole
   First Cause. [185] But while the reproach was thus repelled of making
   Father and Son "brothers", an approach was made to the Gnostic doctrine
   of √Üons, and Tertullian himself felt, and was unable to avert, the
   danger of falling into the channel of the Gnostics. [186] His arguments
   in his writing Adv. Praxeas are not free from half concessions and
   uncertainties, while the whole tenor of the work contrasts strikingly
   with that of the anti-gnostic tractates. Tertullian finds himself time
   and again compelled in his work to pass from the offensive to the
   defensive, and the admissions that he makes show his uncertainty. Thus
   he concedes that we may not speak of two Lords or two Gods, that in
   certain circumstances the Son also can be called Almighty, or even
   Father, that the Son will in the end restore all things to the Father,
   and, as it would seem, will merge in the Father; finally, and
   especially, that the Son is not only not aliud a patre (different in
   substance from the Father), but even in some way not alius a patre
   [187] (different in person etc). Yet Tertullian and his comrades were
   by no means at a disadvantage in comparison with the Monarchians. They
   could appeal (1) to the Rule of Faith in which the personal distinction
   between the Father and Son was recognised; [188] (2) to the Holy
   Scriptures from which it was, in fact, easy to reduce the arguments of
   the Monarchians ad absurdum; [189] (3) to the distinction between
   Christians and Jews which consisted, of course, in the belief of the
   former in the Son; [190] and lastly, and this was the most important
   point, they could cite the Johannine writings, especially in support of
   the doctrine of the Logos. It was of the highest importance in the
   controversy that Christ could be shown to have been called the Logos in
   John's Gospel and the Apocalypse. [191] In view of the way in which the
   Scriptures were then used in the Church, these passages were fatal to
   Monarchianism. The attempts to interpret them symbolically [192] could
   not but fail in the end, as completely as those, e.g., of Callistus and
   Paul of Samasota, to combine the use of the expression "Logos" with a
   rejection of the apologetic conception of it based on Philo. Meanwhile
   Tertullian and Hippolytus did not, to all appearance, yet succeed in
   getting their form of doctrine approved in the Churches. The God of
   mystery of whom they taught was viewed as an unknown God, and their
   Christology did not correspond to the wants of men. The Logos was,
   indeed, to be held one in essence with God; but yet he was, by his
   being made the organ of the creation of the world, an inferior divine
   being, or rather at once inferior and not inferior. This conception,
   however, conflicted with tradition as embodied in worship, which taught
   men to see God Himself in Christ, quite as much as the attempt was
   opposed by doctrinal tradition, to derive the use of the name "Son of
   God" for Christ, not from His miraculous birth, but from a decree
   dating before the world. [193] For the rest, the older enemies of
   Monarchianism still maintained common ground with their opponents, in
   so far as God's evolving of Himself in several substances (Hypostases)
   was throughout affected by the history of the world (cosmos), and in
   this sense by the history of revelation. The difference between them
   and at least the later Monarchians was here only one of degree. The
   latter began at the incarnation (or at the theophanies of the O. T.),
   and from it dated a nominal plurality, the former made the "economic"
   self-unfolding of God originate immediately before the creation of the
   world. Here we have the cosmological interest coming once more to the
   front in the Church Fathers and displacing the historical, while it
   ostensibly raised the latter to a higher plane.

   Wherever the doctrine of the Logos planted itself in the third century
   the question, whether the divine being who appeared on earth was
   identical with the Deity, was answered in the negative. [194] In
   opposition to this Gnostic view, which was first to be corrected in the
   fourth century, the Monarchians maintained a very ancient and valuable
   position in clinging to the identity of the eternal Deity, with the
   Deity revealed on earth. But does not the dilemma that arises show that
   the speculation on both sides was as untenable as unevangelical? Either
   we preserve the identity, and in that case defend the thesis, at once
   absurd and inconsistent with the Gospel, that Christ was the Father
   himself; or with the Gospel we retain the distinction between Father
   and Son, but then announce a subordinate God after the fashion of a
   Gnostic polytheism. Certainly, as regards religion, a very great
   advance was arrived at, when Athanasius, by his exclusive formula of
   Logos homoousios (consubstantial Logos), negatived both Modalism and
   subordinationist Gnosticism, but the Hellenic foundation of the whole
   speculation was preserved, and for the rational observer a second rock
   of offence was merely piled upon a first. However, under the conditions
   of scientific speculation at the time, the formula was the saving
   clause by which men were once for all turned from Adoptianism, whose
   doctrine of a deification of Jesus could not fail, undoubtedly, to
   awaken the most questionable recollections.

   (b) The last stages of Modalism in the West, and the State of Theology.

   Our information is very defective concerning the destinies of
   Monarchianism in Rome and the West, after the close of the first thirty
   years of the third century; nor are we any better off in respect to the
   gradual acceptance of the Logos Christology. The excommunication of
   Sabellius by Callistus in Rome resulted at once in the Monarchians
   ceasing to find any followers in the West, and in the complete
   withdrawal soon afterwards of strict and aggressive Modalism. [195]
   Callistus himself has, besides, not left to posterity an altogether
   clean reputation as regards his Christology, although he had covered
   himself in the main point by his compromise formula. [196] Hippolytus'
   sect had ceased to exist about A.D. 250; nay, it is not altogether
   improbable that he himself made his peace with the great Church shortly
   before his death. [197] We can infer from Novatian's important work "De
   trinitate", that the following tenets were recognised in Rome about
   250: [198] (1) Christ did not first become God. (2) The Father did not
   suffer. (3) Christ pre-existed and is true God and man. [199] But it
   was not only in Rome that these tenets were established, but also in
   many provinces. If the Roman Bishop Dionysius could write in a work of
   his own against the Sabellians, that "Sabellius blasphemed, saying that
   the Son was himself Father", [200] then we must conclude that this
   doctrine was then held inadmissible in the West. Cyprian again has
   expressed himself as follows (Ep. 73. 4): "Patripassiani, Valentiniani,
   Appelletiani, Ophit√¶, Marcionit√¶ et cetere h√¶reticorum pestes" ( -- the
   other plagues of heretics), and we must decide that the strict
   Modalistic form of doctrine was then almost universally condemned in
   the West. Of the difficulties met with in the ejection of the heresy,
   or the means employed, we have no information. Nothing was changed in
   the traditional Creed -- a noteworthy and momentous difference from the
   oriental Churches! But we know of one case in which an important
   alteration was proposed. The Creed of the Church of Aquileia began, in
   the fourth century, with the words "I believe in God the Father
   omnipotent, invisible, and impassible" (Credo in deo patre omnipotente,
   invisibili et impassibili), and Rufinus, who has preserved it for us,
   tells [201] that the addition was made, at any rate as early as the
   third century, in order to exclude the Patripassians.

   But the exclusion of the strict Modalists involved neither their
   immediate end, nor the wholesale adoption of the teaching of Tertullian
   and Hippolytus, of the philosophical doctrine of the Logos. As regards
   the latter, the recognition of the name of Logos for Christ, side by
   side with other titles, did not at once involve the reception of the
   Logos doctrine, and the very fact, that no change was made in the
   Creed, shows how reluctant men were to give more than a necessary
   minimum of space to philosophical speculations. They were content with
   the formula, extracted from the Creed, "Jesus Christus, deus et homo",
   and with the combination of the Biblical predicates applied to Christ,
   predicates which also governed their conception of the Logos. In this
   respect the second Book of the Testimonies of Cyprian is of great
   importance. In the first six chapters the divinity of Christ is
   discussed, in terms of Holy Scripture, under the following headings.
   (1) Christum primogenitum esse et ipsum esse sapientiam dei, per quem
   omnia facta sunt; (2) quod sapientia dei Christus; (3) quod Christus
   idem sit et sermo dei; (4) quod Christus idem manus et brachium dei;
   (5) quod idem angelus et deus; (6) quod deus Christus. Then follows,
   after some sections on the appearing of Christ: (10) quod et homo et
   deus Christus. The later Nicene and Chalcedonian doctrine was the
   property of the Western Church from the third century, not in the form
   of a philosophically technical speculation, but in that of a
   categorical Creed-like expression of faith -- see Novatian's "De
   trinitate", in which the doctrine of the Logos falls into the
   background. Accordingly the statement of Socrates (H. E. III. 7) is not
   incredible, that the Western Churchman Hosius had already declared the
   distinction between ousi'a and hupo'stasis (substantia and persona)
   before the Council of Nic√¶a. [202] The West welcomed in the fourth
   century all statements which contained the complete divinity of Christ,
   without troubling itself much about arguments and proofs, and the
   controversy between the two Dionysii in the middle of the third century
   (see under), proves that a declared interest was kept up in the
   complete divinity of Christ, as an inheritance from the Monarchian
   period in Rome. [203] Nay, a latent Monarchian element really continued
   to exist in the Western Church; this we can still study in the poems of
   Commodian. [204] Commodian, again, was not yet acquainted with
   speculations regarding the "complete" humanity of Jesus; he is
   satisfied with the flesh of Christ being represented as a sheath, (V.
   224, "And suffers, as he willed, in our likeness"; [205] on the other
   hand, V. 280, "now the flesh was God, in which the virtue of God
   acted.") [206] But these are only symptoms of a Christian standpoint
   which was fundamentally different from that of oriental theologians,
   and which Commodian was by no means the only one to occupy. He,
   Lactantius, and Arnobius [207] are very different from each other.
   Commodian was a practical Churchman; Arnobius was an empiricist and in
   some form also a sceptic and decided opponent of Platonism; [208] while
   Lactantius was a disciple of Cicero and well acquainted besides with
   the speculations of Greek Christian theology. But they are all three
   closely connected in the contrast they present to the Greek theologians
   of the school of Origen; there is nothing mystical about them, they are
   not Neoplatonists. Lactantius has, indeed, expounded the doctrine of
   Christ, the incarnate Logos, as well as any Greek; as a professional
   teacher it was all known and familiar to him; [209] but as he nowhere
   encounters any problems in his Christology, as he discusses doctrines
   with very few theological or philosophical formulas, almost in a light
   tone, as if they were mere matters of course, we see that he had no
   interest of his own in them. He was rather interested in exactly the
   same questions as Arnobius and Commodian, who again showed no anxiety
   to go beyond the simplest Christological formulas  --   that Christ was
   God, that he had, however, also assumed flesh, or united himself with a
   man, since otherwise we could not have borne the deity: "And God was
   man, that he might possess us in the future" (Et fuit homo deus, ut nos
   in futuro haberet). [210] [211] The Christianity and theology which
   these Latins energetically supported against polytheism, were summed up
   in Monotheism, a powerfully elaborated morality, the hope of the
   Resurrection which was secured by the work of the God Christ who had
   crushed the demons, and in unadulterated Chiliasm. [212] Monotheism --
   in the sense of Cicero "De natura deorum" -- Moralism, and Chiliasm:
   these are the clearly perceived and firmly held points, and not only
   for Apologetic purposes, but also, as is proved especially by the
   second book of Commodian's "Instructiones", in independent and positive
   expositions. These Instructions are, along with the Carmen Apolog., of
   the highest importance for our estimate of Western Christianity in the
   period A.D. 250-315. We discover here, 100 years after the Gnostic
   fight, a Christianity that was affected, neither by the theology of the
   anti-gnostic Church Fathers, nor specially by that of the Alexandrians,
   one which the dogmatic contentions and conquests of the years 150-250
   have passed over, hardly leaving a trace. Almost all that is required
   to explain it by the historian who starts with the period of Justin is
   to be found in the slightly altered conditions of the Roman world of
   culture, and in the development of the Church system as a practical
   power, a political and social quantity. [213] Even in the use of
   Scripture this Christianity of the West reveals its conservatism. The
   Books of the O. T. and the Apocalypse are those still most in vogue.
   [214] Commodian does not stand alone, nor are the features to be
   observed in his "Instructiones" accidental. And we are not limited to
   the Apologists Arnobius and Lactantius for purposes of comparison. We
   learn much the same thing as to African Christianity from the works of
   Cyprian, or, even from the theological attitude of the Bishop himself,
   as we infer from Commodian's poems. And, on the other hand, Latin
   Church Fathers of the fourth century, e.g., Zeno and Hilary, show in
   their writings that we must not look for the theological interests of
   the West in the same quarter as those of the East. In fact the West did
   not, strictly speaking, possess a specifically Church "theology" at
   all. [215] It was only from the second half of the fourth century that
   the West was invaded by the Platonic theology which Hippolytus,
   Tertullian, and Novatian had cultivated, to all appearance without any
   thorough success. Some of its results were accepted, but the theology
   itself was not. Nor, in some ways, was it later on, when the Western
   structure of Monotheism, energetic practical morality, and conservative
   Chiliasm fell a prey to destruction. The mystical tendencies, or the
   perceptions that led to them, were themselves awanting. Yet there is no
   mistake, on the other hand, as we are taught by the Institutiones of
   Lactantius as well as the Tractates of Cyprian, that the rejection of
   Modalism and the recognition of Christ as the Logos forced upon the
   West the necessity of rising from faith to a philosophical and, in
   fact, a distinctively Neoplatonic dogmatic. It was simply a question of
   time when this departure should take place. The recognition of the
   Logos could not fail ultimately to produce everywhere a ferment which
   transformed the Rule of Faith into the compendium of a scientific
   religion. It is hardly possible to conjecture how long and where
   Monarchians maintained their ground as independent sects in the West.
   It is yet most probable that there were Patripassians in Rome in the
   fourth century. The Western Fathers and opponents of heretics from the
   middle of the fourth century speak not infrequently of Monarchians --
   Sabellians; but they, as a rule, have simply copied Greek sources, from
   which they have transferred the confusion that prevailed among the
   Greek representatives of Sabellianism, and to a still greater extent,
   we must admit, among the historians who were hostile to it. [216]

   (c) The Modalistic Monarchians in the East: Sabellianism and the
   History of Philosophical Christology and Theology after Origen. [217]

   After the close of the third century the name of "Sabellians" became
   the common title of Modalistic Monarchians in the East. In the West
   also the term was used here and there, in the same way, in the fourth
   and fifth centuries. In consequence of this the traditional account of
   the doctrines taught by Sabellius and his immediate disciples is very
   confused. Zahn has the credit of having shown that the propositions,
   especially, which were first published by Marcellus of Ancyra, were
   characterised by opponents as Sabellian because Monarchian, and in
   later times they have been imputed to the older theologian. But not
   only does the work of Marcellus pass under the name of Sabellius up to
   the present day, Monarchianism undoubtedly assumed very different forms
   in the East in the period between Hippolytus and Athanasius. It was
   steeped in philosophical speculation. Doctrines based on kenosis and
   transformation were developed. And the whole was provided by the
   historians with the same label. At the same time these writers went on
   drawing inferences, until they have described forms of doctrine which,
   in this connection, in all probability never existed at all.
   Accordingly, even after the most careful examination and sifting of the
   information handed down, it is now unfortunately impossible to write a
   history of Monarchianism from Sabellius to Marcellus; for the accounts
   are not only confused, but fragmentary and curt. It is quite as
   impossible to give a connected history of the Logos Christology from
   Origen to Arius and Athanasius, although the tradition is in this case
   somewhat fuller. But the orthodox of the fourth and fifth centuries
   found little to please them in the Logos doctrine of those earlier
   disciples of Origen, and consequently they transmitted a very
   insignificant part of their writings to posterity. This much is
   certain, however, that in the East the fight against Monarchianism in
   the second half of the third century was a violent one, and that even
   the development of the Logos Christology (of Origen) was directly and
   lastingly influenced by this opposition. [218] The circumstance, that
   "Sabelliansim" was almost the only name by which Monarchianism was
   known in the East, points, for the rest, to schisms having resulted
   only from, or, at any rate, after the appearance and labours of
   Sabellius in the East, therefore at the earliest since about 230-240.
   So long as Origen lived in Alexandria no schism took place in Egypt
   over the Christological question. [219]

   Sabellius, perhaps by birth a Lybian from Pentapolis, [220] seems after
   his excommunication to have remained at the head of a small community
   in Rome. He was still there, to all appearance, when Hippolytus wrote
   the Philosophumena. Nor do we know of his ever having left the city, --
   we are nowhere told that he did. Yet he must have, at least, set an
   important movement at work abroad from Rome as his centre, and have
   especially fostered relations with the East. When, in Pentapolis, about
   A.D. 260, and several years after the death of Origen, the Monarchian
   doctrine took hold of the Churches there (Dionys., l.c.)  -- Churches
   which, it is significant, were to some extent Latin in their culture --
   Sabellius can hardly have been alive, yet it was under his name that
   the heresy was promoted. [221] But it would seem as if this prominence
   was given to him for the first time about A.D. 260. Origen at least had
   not, so far as I know, mentioned the name of Sabellius in his
   discussions of Monarchianism. These date from as early as A.D. 215. At
   the time, Origen was in Rome, Zephyrine being still Bishop. From the
   relations which he then entered into with Hippolytus, it has been
   rightly concluded that he did not hold aloof from the contentions in
   Rome, and took the side of Hippolytus. This attitude of Origen's may
   not have been without influence on his condemnation afterwards in Rome
   by Pontian, 231 or 232. Origen's writings, moreover, contain many sharp
   censures on Bishops who, in order to glorify God, made the distinction
   between Father and Son merely nominal. And this again seems to have
   been said not without reference to the state of matters in Rome. The
   theology of Origen made him an especially energetic opponent of the
   Modalistic form of doctrine; for although the new principles set up by
   him -- that the Logos, looking to the content of his nature, possessed
   the complete deity, and that he from eternity was created from the
   being of the Father -- approached apparently a Monarchian mode of
   thought, yet they in fact repelled it more energetically then
   Tertullian and Hippolytus could possibly have done. He who followed the
   philosophical theology of Origen was proof against all Monarchianism.
   But it is important to notice that in all places where Origen comes to
   speak about Monarchians, he merely seems to know their doctrines in an
   extremely simple form, and without any speculative embroidery. They are
   always people who "deny that Father and Son are two Hypostases" (they
   say: hen ou monon ousia, alla kai hupokeimeo), who "fuse together"
   Father and Son (suncheein), who admit distinctions in God only in
   "conception" and "name", and not in "number", etc. Origen considers
   them therefore to be untheological creatures, mere "believers".
   Accordingly, he did not know the doctrine of Sabellius, and living in
   Syria and Palestine had even had no opportunity of learning it.

   That doctrine was undoubtedly closely allied, as Epiphanius has rightly
   seen (H. 62. 1), to the teaching of No√´tus; it was distinguished from
   the latter, however, both by a more careful theological elaboration,
   and by the place given to the Holy Ghost. [222] The opinion of Nitzsch
   and others, that we must distinguish between two stages in the theology
   of Sabellius, is unnecessary, whenever we eliminate the unreliable
   sources. The central proposition of Sabellius ran that Father, Son, and
   Holy Spirit were the same. Three names accordingly were attached to one
   and the same being. It was his interest in monotheism that influenced
   Sabellius. "What shall we say," urge his followers in Epiphanius (ch.
   2), "have we one God or three Gods?" (ti an eipomen, hena Theon echoen,
   e treis Theous); and Epiphanius (ch. 3) replies: "we do not propound
   polytheism" (ou polutheian eisegoumetha). Whether Sabellius himself
   used the comparison between the threefold nature of man and the sun
   remains a question (one nature, three energies: to photistikon light
   giving, to thalpon heat giving, to schema the form). [223] The one
   being was also called by Sabellius huiopator, [224] an expression which
   was certainly chosen to remove any misunderstanding, to make it
   impossible to suppose that two beings were in question. This huiopator
   (son-father) was in Sabellius the ultimate designation for God Himself,
   and not, say, merely for certain manifestations of a monas (unit)
   resting in the background. Sabellius, however, taught -- according to
   Epiphanius and Athanasius -- that God was not at the same time Father
   and Son; but that he had, rather, put forth his activity in three
   successive "energies"; first, in the Prosopon (= form of manifestation,
   figure; not = Hypostasis) of the Father as Creator and Lawgiver;
   secondly, in the Prosopon of the Son as Redeemer, beginning with the
   incarnation and ending at the ascension; finally, and up till the
   present hour, in the Prosopon of the Spirit as giver and sustainer of
   life. [225] We do not know whether Sabellius was able strictly to carry
   out the idea of the strict succession of the Prosopa, so that the one
   should form the boundary of the other. It is possible, indeed it is not
   improbable, that he could not fail to recognise in nature a continuous
   energy of God as Father. [226] It is self-evident that the Sabellians
   would approve of the Catholic Canon; that they did, is confirmed by
   Epiphanius. They are said to have appealed especially to passages like
   Deut. VI. 4, Exod. XX. 3, Isa. XLIV. 6 and John X. 38. [227] But
   Epiphanius remarks besides that the Sabellians derived their whole
   heresy and its strength from certain Apocrypha, especially the
   so-called Gospel of the Egyptians. [228] This note is instructive; for
   it not only recalls to our recollection a lost literature of the second
   century, especially the Gospel of the Egyptians, [229] but it also
   shows that the use of an uncanonical Gospel had long continued among
   Catholics in the Pentapolis, or at any rate in Egypt. [230] Finally, it
   confirms the view that the Christology of Sabellius cannot have been
   essentially different from the older, the so-called Patripassian
   doctrine. It is distinguished from the latter neither by the assumption
   of a transcendental Monas resting behind the Prosopa, nor by the
   introduction of the category of the Logos -- which was made use of by
   Callistus, but not by Sabellius; nor by a speculative theory, borrowed
   from the Stoa, of the Deity, self-contained, and again unfolding
   itself; nor, finally, by a doctrine of the Trinity constructed in any
   fashion or by the expression huiopator, which, as used by Sabellius,
   simply affirmed the single personality of God. As to the doctrine of
   the Trinity, a triad was distinctly out of the question in Sabellius.
   The only noteworthy and real differences are found in these three
   points; first, in the attempt to demonstrate the succession of the
   Prosopa; secondly, as observed above, in the reference to the Holy
   Spirit; thirdly, in formally placing the Father on a parallel line with
   the two other Prosopa. The attempt mentioned above may be regarded as a
   return to the strict form of Modalism, which it was possible to hold
   was impugned by formulas like the compassus est pater filio (the Father
   suffered in sympathy with the Son). In the reference to the Holy
   Spirit, Sabellius simply followed the new theology, which was beginning
   to take the Spirit more thoroughly into account. Most important is the
   third point mentioned. For in ranging the Prosopon and energy of the
   Father in a series with the two others, not only was cosmology
   introduced into the Modalistic doctrine as a parallel to soteriology,
   but the pre√´minence of the Father over the other Prosopa was departed
   from in principle, and thus, in a curious fashion, the way was prepared
   for the Athanasian, and still more for the Western and Augustinian
   Christology. Here, undoubtedly, we have the decisive advance marked by
   Sabellianism within Monarchianism. It led up to the exclusive
   homoou'sios (consubstantial); for it is probable that Sabellians
   employed this expression. [231] They could apply it with perfect right.
   Further, while up to this time no evident bond had connected cosmology
   and soteriology within Modalistic theology, Sabellius now made the
   histories of the world and salvation into a history of the God who
   revealed himself in them. In other words, this Monarchianism became
   commensurate in form with that theology which employed the conception
   of the Logos, and this fact may have constituted by no means the least
   part of the attractiveness which Sabellianism proved itself to possess
   in no small degree up to the beginning of the fourth century and even
   later. [232] However, it is not to be concealed that the teaching of
   Sabellius relative to the Prosopon of the Father is particularly
   obscure. The sentence attributed to him by Athanasius, [233] "as there
   are diversities of spiritual gifts, but the same spirit, so also the
   Father is the same, but unfolds himself in Son and Spirit" -- seems at
   the first glance to contradict the details given above. Yet the
   different gifts are certainly the Spirit himself, which so unfolds
   himself in them that he does not remain an element behind them, but is
   completely merged in them. In the same way the Father unfolds himself
   in the Prosopa. The witnesses to the succession of the Prosopa in
   Sabellius are too strong to allow us to infer from this passage that
   the Father still remained Father after the unfolding (platusmos) in the
   Son. But this passage shows that philosophical speculations could
   readily attach themselves to the simple theory of Sabellius. Marcellus
   rejected his doctrine which he knew accurately. What he missed in it
   was the recognition of the Logos; therefore the idea of God had also
   not been correctly apprehended by him. [234] But the form given to
   Monarchianism by Marcellus [235] won few friends for that type of
   doctrine. Alexandrian theologians, or Western scholars who came to
   their assistance, had already perfected the combination of Origen's
   doctrine of the Logos with the Monarchian Homoousios; in other words,
   they had turned the category used by Origen against the logos ktisma
   conception (the Logos-created) of Origen himself. The saving formula, ,
   the Logos of the same substance, not made" (logos homoousios ou
   poietheis), was already uttered, and, suspiciously like Monarchianism
   as it sounded at first, became for that very reason the means of making
   Monarchianism superfluous in the Church, and of putting an end to it.
   [236]

   But that only happened after great fights. One of these we know, the
   controversy of the two Dionysii, a prelude to the Arian conflict. [237]
   In the Pentapolis the Sabellian doctrine had, soon after the death of
   Origen, won a great following even among the Bishops, "so that the Son
   of God was no longer preached." Dionysius of Alexandria, therefore,
   composed various letters in which he tried to recall those who had been
   misled, and to refute Sabellianism. [238] In one of these, directed to
   Euphranor and Ammonius, he gave an extreme exposition of Origen's
   doctrine of the subordination of the Son. This letter seemed very
   questionable to some Christians -- probably in Alexandria, perhaps in
   Pentapolis. They lodged a complaint, soon after A.D. 260, against the
   Alexandrian Bishop with Dionysius in Rome. [239] The latter assembled a
   synod at Rome, which disapproved of the expressions used by the
   Alexandrian, and himself despatched to Alexandria a didactic letter
   against the Sabellians and their opponents, who inclined to
   subordinationism. In this letter the Bishop so far spared his colleague
   as not to mention his name; but he sent him a letter privately, calling
   for explanations. The Alexandrian Bishop sought to justify himself in a
   long document in four books (eleg chos kai apologia), maintained that
   his accusers had wickedly torn sentences from their context, and gave
   explanations which seem to have satisfied the Roman Bishop, and which
   Athanasius at any rate admitted to be thoroughly orthodox. But the
   letter of the Roman Bishop appears to have had no immediate influence
   on the further development in Alexandria (see under); the universal
   collapse of the Empire in the following decades permitted the
   Alexandrian theologians to continue their speculations, without needing
   to fear further immediate reproofs from Roman Bishops.

   Two facts give a special interest to the controversy of the Dionysii.
   First, in spite of the acceptance of the sacred Triad, the Romans
   adhered simply, without any speculative harmonising, to the unity of
   the Deity, and decided that Origen's doctrine of subordination was
   Tritheism. Secondly, no scruple was felt at Alexandria in carrying out
   the subordination of the Son to the Father until it involved
   separation, though it was well known that such a view was supported,
   not by the tradition of the Church, but by philosophy alone. The
   accusers of the Alexandrian Dionysius charged him with separating
   Father and Son; [240] denying the eternal existence of the Son; [241]
   naming the Father without the Son and vice vers√¢; [242] omitting to use
   the word homoousios; [243] and finally, with regarding the Son as a
   creature, related to the Father as the vine to the gardener, or the
   boat to the shipbuilder. [244] In these censures, which were not
   inaccurate, it is obvious that Dionysius, continuing the Neoplatonic
   speculations of his teacher, conceived the logos as portio and
   derivatio of the monas, thus, in order to meet Sabellianism, actually
   dividing him from the deity. Dionysius sought to excuse himself in his
   elenchos (Refutation), and emphasised exclusively the other side of
   Origen's doctrine, at the same time admitting that in his incriminated
   writing he had incidentally employed somewhat unsuitable similes. Now
   he said that the Father had always been Father, and that Christ had
   always existed as the Logos and wisdom and power of God; that the Son
   had his being from the Father, and that he was related to the Father as
   the rays are to the light. [245] He explained that while he had not
   used the word homoousios, because it did not occur in Holy Scripture,
   figures were to be found in his earlier writings which corresponded to
   it; thus the figure of parents and children, of seed or root and plant,
   and of source and stream. [246] The Father was the source of all good,
   the Son the outflow; the Father the mind (nous), the Son the word
   (logos) -- reminding us very forcibly of Neoplatonism -- or the
   emanating mind (nous propedon), while the nous itself remains "and is
   what it was" (kai estin hoios en). "But being sent he flew forth and is
   borne everywhere, and thus each is in each, the one being of the other,
   and they are one, being two' (Ho de exepte propemphtheis kai pheretai
   pantachou kai houtos estin hekateros en hekatero heteros on thaterou,
   kai hen eisin, ontes duo). [247] But he now went further: any
   separation between Father and Son was to be repudiated. "I say Father,
   and before I add the Son, I have already included and designated him in
   the Father." The same holds true of the Holy Spirit. Their very names
   always bind all three together inseparably. "How then do I who use
   these names think that these are divided and entirely separated from
   each other? (pos oun ho toutois chromenos tois onomasi memeristhai
   tauta kai aphoristhai pantelos allelon oiomai;). [248] In these words
   the retreat was sounded; for what the Roman Bishop rejected, but
   Alexandrian theology never ventured wholly to discard, was the
   "dividing" (merizesthai). [249] The reservation lies in the word
   "entirely" (pantelos). Dionysius added in conclusion: "Thus we unfold
   the unit into the triad without dividing it, and we sum up the triad
   again into the unit without diminishing it," (houto men hemeis eis te
   ten triada ten monada platunomen adiaireton, kai ten triada palin
   ameioton eis ten monada sunkephalaioumetha). In this he has
   accommodated himself to a mode of looking at things which he could only
   allege to be his own under a mental reservation, as in the case of the
   qualification "entirely" (pantelos). For the terms platunein and
   sunkephalaiousthai were not those current in the school of Origen, and
   admit of a different interpretation. Finally, Dionysius denied the
   charge of the "sycophants" that he made the Father the Creator of
   Christ. [250]

   The letter of Dionysius of Rome falls midway between these two
   manifestoes, which are so different, of the Alexandrian Bishop. We have
   to regret very deeply that Athanasius has only preserved one, though a
   comprehensive, fragment of this document. [251] It is extremely
   characteristic of the Roman Bishop, to begin with, that it seeks to
   settle the sound doctrine by representing it as the just mean between
   the false unitarian or Sabellian, and the false trinitarian or
   Alexandrian doctrine. [252] The second characteristic of the letter is
   that it regards the Alexandrian doctrine as teaching that there are
   three Gods, and draws a parallel between it and the Three principles of
   the Marcionites. This proves that the Roman Bishop did not trouble
   himself with the speculation of the Alexandrians, and simply confined
   himself to the result -- as he conceived it -- of three separate
   Hypostases. [253] Finally -- and this is the third characteristic
   feature -- the letter shows that Dionysius had nothing positive to say,
   further than that it was necessary to adhere to the ancient Creed,
   definitely interpreting it to mean that the three, Father, Son, and
   Spirit, were equally one. Absolutely no attempt is made to explain or
   to prove this paradox. [254] But here undoubtedly lies the strength of
   the Roman Bishop's position. When we compare his letter with that of
   Leo I. to Flavian and Agatho's to the Emperor, we are astonished at the
   close affinity of these Roman manifestoes. In form they are absolutely
   identical. The three Popes did not trouble themselves about proofs or
   arguments, but fixed their attention solely on the consequences, or
   what seemed to them consequences, of disputed doctrines. Starting with
   these deductions they refuted doctrines of the right and left, and
   simply fixed a middle theory, which existed merely in words, for it was
   self-contradictory. This they grounded formally on their ancient Creed
   without even attempting to argue out the connection: one God  --
   Father, Son and Spirit; one Person -- perfect God and perfect man; one
   Person  --   two wills. Their contentment with establishing a middle
   line, which possessed the attribute of that known in mathematics, is,
   however, a proof that they had not a positive, but merely a negative,
   religious interest in these speculations. Otherwise they would not have
   been satisfied with a definition it was impossible to grasp; for no
   religion lives in conceptions which cannot be represented and realised.
   Their religious interest centred in the God Jesus, who had assumed the
   substantia humana.

   The letter of the Roman Bishop produced only a passing impression in
   Alexandria. Its adoption would have meant the repudiation of science. A
   few years afterwards the great Synod of Antioch expressly rejected the
   term homoousios (consubstantial) as being liable to misconstruction.
   [255] The followers of Origen in his training school continued their
   master's work, and they were not molested in Alexandria itself, as it
   seems, up till about the close of the third century. If we review the
   great literary labours of Dionysius, of which we, unfortunately, only
   possess fragments, and observe his attitude in the questions debated in
   the Church in his time, we see how faithfully he followed in the track
   of Origen. The only difference lay in greater laxity in matters of
   discipline. [256] He proved, in his work "On Promises" (peri
   epangelion) that he possessed the zeal against all Chiliasm and the
   dexterity in critical exegesis which characterised the school of
   Origen; [257] and in his work "On Nature" (peri phuseos) he introduced,
   and endeavoured to carry out, a new task in the science of Christian
   theology, viz., the systematic refutation of Materialism, i.e., of the
   Atomic theory. [258] Of the later heads of the training school we know
   very little; but that little is enough to let us see that they
   faithfully preserved the theology of Origen. Pierius, who also led a
   life of strict asceticism, wrote learned commentaries and treatises.
   Photius [259] testifies that he taught piously concerning the Father
   and Son, "except that he speaks of two "beings" and two natures; using
   the words being and nature, as is plain from the context, in place of
   Hypostasis, and not as those who adhere to Arius" (plen hoti ousias duo
   kai phuseis duo legei; to tes ousias kai phuseos onomati, hos delon, ek
   te ton hepomenon kai proegoumenon tou choriou anti tes hupostaseos kai
   ouch hos hoi Areio prosanakeimenoi chromenos). This explanation is
   hardly trustworthy; Photius himself is compelled to add that Pierius
   held impious doctrines as to the Holy Ghost, and ranked him far below
   the Father and Son. Now since he further expressly testifies that
   Pierius, like Origen, held the pre-existence of souls, and explained
   some passages in the O. T. "economically", i.e., contested their
   literal meaning, it becomes obvious that Pierius had not parted company
   with Origen; [260] indeed, he was even called "Origen Junior". [261] He
   was the teacher of Pamphilus, and the latter inherited from him his
   unconditional devotion to Origen's theology. Pierius was followed, in
   Diocletian's time, by Theognostus at the Alexandrian school. This
   scholar composed a great dogmatic work in seven books called
   "Hypotyposes". It has been described for us by Photius, [262] whose
   account shows that it was planned on a strict system, and was
   distinguished from Origen's great work, in that the whole was not
   discussed in each part under reference to one main thought, but the
   system of doctrine was presented in a continuous and consecutive
   exposition. [263] Thus Theognostus invented that form of scientific,
   Church dogmatic which was to set a standard to posterity -- though it
   was indeed long before the Church took courage to erect a doctrinal
   structure of its own. Athanasius had nothing but praise for the work of
   Theognostus, and has quoted a passage from the second book which
   undoubtedly proves that Theognostus did full justice to the Homoousian
   side of Origen's Christology. [264] But even the Cappadocians remarked
   certain affinities between Arius and Theognostus, [265] and Photius
   informs us that he called the Son a "creature" (ktisma), and said such
   mean things about him that one might perhaps suppose that he was simply
   quoting, in order to refute, the opinions of other men. He also, like
   Origen, taught heterodox views as to the Holy Spirit, and the grounds
   on which he based the possibility of the incarnation were empty and
   worthless. As a matter of fact, Theognostus' exposition of the sin
   against the Holy Ghost shows that he attached himself most closely to
   Origen. For it is based on the well-known idea of the master that the
   Father embraced the largest, the Son, the medium, and the Holy Spirit
   the smallest sphere; that the sphere of the Son included all rational
   beings, inclusive of the imperfect, while that of the Spirit
   comprehended only the perfect (teleioumenoi), and that therefore the
   sin against the Holy Ghost, as the sin of the "perfect", could not be
   forgiven. [266] The only novelty is that Theognostus saw occasion
   expressly to attack the view "that the teaching of the Spirit was
   superior to that of the Son" (ten tou pneumatos didaskalian
   huperballein tes tou huiou didaches). Perhaps he did this to oppose
   another disciple of Origen, Hieracas, who applied himself to
   speculations concerning Melchizedek, as being the Holy Spirit, and
   emphasised the worship of the Spirit. [267] This Copt, who lived at the
   close of the third and in the first half of the fourth century, cannot
   be passed over, because, a scholar like Origen, [268] he on the one
   hand modified and refined on certain doctrines of his master, [269] and
   on the other hand, emphasised his practical principles, requiring
   celibacy as a Christian law. [270] Hieracas is for us the connecting
   link between Origen and the Coptic monks; the union of ascetics founded
   by him may mark the transition from the learned schools of theologians
   to the society of monks. But in his proposition that, as regards
   practice, the suppression of the sexual impulse was the decisive, and
   original, demand of the Logos Christ, Hieracas set up the great theme
   of the Church of the fourth and following century.

   In Alexandria the system of faith and the theology of Origen were fused
   more and more completely together, and it cannot be proved that the
   immediate disciples of Origen, the heads of the training-school,
   corrected their master. [271] The first to do this in Alexandria was
   Peter, Bishop and Martyr. [272] In his writings "Concerning divinity"
   (peri theotetos), "Concerning the sojourn of our Saviour" (peri tes
   soteros hemon epidemias), and especially in his books "Concerning (the
   fact) that the soul does not preexist, nor has entered this body after
   having sinned" (peri tou mede prouparchein ten psuchen mede amartesasan
   touto eis soma blethenai), he maintains against Origen the complete
   humanity of the Redeemer, the creation of our souls along with our
   bodies, and the historical character of the events narrated in Gen.
   III., and he characterises the doctrine of a pre-mundane fall as a
   "precept of Greek philosophy which is foreign and alien to those who
   desire to live piously in Christ" (mathema tes Hellenikes philosophias,
   xenes kai allotrias ouses ton en Christo eusebos thelonton zen). [273]
   This utterance proves that Peter had taken up a position definitely
   opposed to Origen; [274] but his own expositions show, on the other
   hand, that he only deprived Origen's doctrines of their extreme
   conclusions, while otherwise he maintained them, in so far as they did
   not come into direct conflict with the rule of faith. The corrections
   on Origen's system were therefore not undertaken silently even in
   Alexandria. A compromise took place between scientific theology, and
   the ancient antignostically determined Creed of the Church, or the
   letter of Holy Scripture, to which all the doctrines of Origen were
   sacrificed that contradicted the tenor of the sacred tradition. [275]
   But above all, the distinction made by him between the Christian
   science of the perfect and the faith of the simple was to be abolished.
   The former must be curtailed, the latter added to, and thus a product
   arrived at in a uniform faith which should be at the same time
   ecclesiastical and scientific. After theology had enjoyed a period of
   liberty, the four last decades of the third century, a reaction seems
   to have set in at the beginning of the fourth, or even at the end of
   the third century, in Alexandria. But the man had not yet risen who was
   to preserve theology from stagnation, or from being resolved into the
   ideas of the time. All the categories employed by the theologians of
   the fourth and fifth centuries were already current in theology, [276]
   but they had not yet received their definite impress and fixed value.
   [277] Even the Biblical texts which in those centuries were especially
   exploited pro and contra, had already been collected in the third.
   Dionysius of Alexandria had already given warning that the word
   homoousios did not occur in Holy Scripture, and this point of view
   seems, as a rule, to have been thoroughly decisive even in the third
   century. [278]

   We get an insight into the state of religious doctrine about the middle
   of the third century and afterwards from the works of Gregory, [279]
   the miracle-worker, who was one of the most eminent of Origen's
   disciples, and whose influence in the provinces of Asia Minor extended
   far into the fourth century. This scholar and Bishop who delivered the
   first Christian panegyric -- one on Origen -- and has in it given his
   autobiography, remained throughout his life an enthusiastic follower of
   Origen, and adhered, in what was essential, to his doctrine of the
   Trinity. [280] But Gregory felt compelled, in opposition to Christians
   whose conception of the Trinity was absolutely polytheistic, to
   emphasise the unity of the Godhead. He did this in his "Confession of
   faith", [281] and in a still greater degree, according to the testimony
   of Basilius, in his lost work dialexis pros Alianon (Debate with
   Ailianus), [282] which contained a proposition, afterwards appealed to
   by Sabellians, and somewhat to the following effect, viz., Father and
   Son are two in thought, but one in substance (pater kai huios epinoia
   men eisi duo, hupostasei de hen). Gregory, on the other hand, described
   the Logos as creature (ktisma) and created (poiema) -- so Basilius
   tells us, -- and this form of expression can probably be explained by
   the fact that he thought it necessary, in this way and aggressively
   (agonistikos), to emphasise, on the basis of Origen's idea of the
   Homoousia of the Son, the substantial unity of the deity, in opposition
   to a view of the divine Hypostases which approximated to polytheism. On
   the whole, however, we cannot avoid supposing, that at the time when
   theology was introduced into the faith -- a work in which Gregory
   especially took part, --   and in consequence the worst confusions set
   in, [283] the tendency to heathen Tritheism had grown, and theologians
   found themselves compelled to maintain the "preaching of the monarchy"
   (kerugma tes monarchias) to an increasing extent. This is proved by the
   correspondence of the Dionysii, the theology of Hieracas, and the
   attitude of Bishop Alexander of Alexandria; but we have also the
   evidence of Gregory. True, the genuineness of the writing ascribed to
   him, on the "essential identity" [284] (of the three Persons), is not
   yet decided, but it belongs, at all events, to the period before
   Athanasius. In this treatise the author seeks to establish the
   indivisibility and uniqueness of God, subject to the hypothesis of a
   certain hypostatic difference. In this he obviously approaches
   Monarchian ideas, yet without falling into them. Further, the very
   remarkable tractate, addressed to Theopompus, on the incapability and
   capability of suffering, [285] treats this very subject, without even
   hinting at a division between Father and Son in this connection; on the
   other hand, the author certainly does not call it in question. We can
   study in the works of Gregory, and in the two treatises [286] just
   mentioned, which bear his name, the state of theological stagnation,
   connected with the indeterminateness of all dogmatic ideas, and the
   danger, then imminent, of passing wholly over to the domain of abstract
   philosophy, and of relaxing the union of speculation with the exegesis
   of Holy Scripture. The problems are strictly confined to the sphere of
   Origen's theology; but that theology was so elastic that they
   threatened to run wild and become thoroughly secular. [287] If, e.g.,
   we review the Christological tenets of Eusebius of C√¶sarea, one of
   Origen's most enthusiastic followers, we are struck by their universal
   hollowness and emptiness, uncertainty and instability. While Monotheism
   is maintained with an immense stock of Bible texts and a display of all
   possible formulas, a created and subordinate God is, in fact,
   interposed between the deity and mankind.

   But there was also in the East a theology which, while it sought to
   make use of philosophy, at the same time tried to preserve in their
   realistic form the religious truths established in the fight with
   Gnosticism. There were theologians who, following in the footsteps of
   Iren√¶us and Hippolytus, by no means despised science, yet found the
   highest truth expressed in the tenets handed down by the Church; and
   who therefore, refusing the claim of philosophical Gnosis to re-edit
   the principles of faith, only permitted it to support, connect, and
   interpret them. These theologians were necessarily hostile to the
   science of religion cultivated in Alexandria, and enemies of its
   founder Origen. We do not know whether, during his life-time, Origen
   came into conflict in the East with opponents who met him in the spirit
   of an Iren√¶us. [288] From his own statements we must suppose that he
   only had to deal with untrained disputants. But in the second half of
   the third century, and at the beginning of the fourth, there were on
   the side of the Church antagonists of Origen's theology who were well
   versed in philosophical knowledge, and who not merely trumped his
   doctrine with their psile pistis (bare faith), but protected the
   principles transmitted by the Church from spiritualising and artificial
   interpretations, with all the weapons of science. [289] The most
   important among them, indeed really the only one of whom we have any
   very precise knowledge, besides Peter of Alexandria (see above), is
   Methodius. [290] But of the great number of treatises by this original
   and prolific author only one has been till now preserved complete in
   the original -- Conviv. decem virg., while we have the greater part of
   a second -- De resurr. [291] The rest has been preserved in the Slavic
   language, and only very lately been rendered accessible. The
   personality of Methodius himself, with his position in history, is
   obscure. [292] But what we do know is enough to show that he was able
   to combine the defence of the Rule of Faith as understood by Iren√¶us,
   Hippolytus, and Tertullian, [293] with the most thorough study of
   Plato's writings and the reverent appropriation of Plato's ideas.
   Indeed he lived in these. [294] Accordingly, he defended "the popular
   conception of the common faith of the Church" in an energetic
   counterblast to Origen, and rejected all his doctrines which contained
   an artificial version of traditional principles. [295] But on the other
   hand, he did not repudiate the basis on which Origen's speculation
   rested. He rather attempted with its presuppositions and method to
   arrive at a result in harmony with the common faith. There seems to be
   no doubt that he took the great work of Iren√¶us as his model; for the
   manner in which Methodius has endeavoured to overcome dualism and
   spiritualism, and to establish a speculative realism, recalls
   strikingly the undertaking of Iren√¶us. Like the latter, Methodius
   sought to demonstrate the eternal importance of the natural
   constitution in spirit and body of the creatures made by God; and he
   conceived salvation not as a disembodying, not in any sense as a
   division and separation, but as a transfiguration of the corporeal, and
   a union of what had been unnaturally divided. He rejected the pessimism
   with which Origen had, like the Gnostics, viewed the world as it is,
   the sustasis tou kosmou, making it, if a well-ordered and necessary
   prison, yet a prison after all. This he confronted with the optimistic
   conviction, that everything which God has created, and as he has
   created it, is capable of permanence and transfiguration. [296]
   Accordingly, he opposed Origen's doctrines of the pre-existence of
   souls, the nature and object of the world and of corporeality, the
   eternal duration of the world, a premundane Fall, the resurrection as a
   destruction of the body, etc. At the same time he certainly
   misrepresented them, as, e.g., Origen's doctrine of sin, p. 68 sq. Like
   Iren√¶us, Methodius introduced curious speculations as to Adam for the
   purpose of establishing realism, i.e., the maintenance of the literal
   truth of sacred history. Adam was to him the whole of natural humanity,
   and he assumed, going beyond Iren√¶us, that the Logos combined the first
   man created (protoplast) with himself. [297] This union was conceived
   as a complete incorporation: "God embraced and comprehended in man;"
   and, starting from this incorporation, the attempt was made to explain
   redemption in terms of a mystical realism. Salvation was not
   consummated in knowledge (Gnosis), but it came to light, already
   achieved for mankind, in the constitution of the God-man. [298] But for
   this very reason Methodius borders, just like Iren√¶us, on a mode of
   thought which sees in the incarnation the necessary completion of
   creation, and conceives the imperfection of the first Adam to have been
   natural. [299] Adam, i.e., mankind, was before Christ still in a
   plastic condition, capable of receiving any impression and liable to
   dissolution. Sin, which had exclusively an external source, had
   therefore an easy task; humanity was first consolidated in Christ. In
   this way freedom is retained, but we easily see that Origen's idea of
   sin was more profound than that of Methodius. [300] The fantastic
   realism of the latter's view is carried out in his speculations on the
   transference of salvation from Christ to individuals. The deep sleep of
   the Protoplast is paralleled in the second Adam by the sleep of death.
   Now as Eve was formed from, and was part of the being of sleeping Adam,
   so the Holy Spirit issued from Christ lying in the sleep of death, and
   was part of his being; [301] and from him the Church was fashioned.

   "The Apostle has excellently applied the history of Adam to Christ. So
   we will require to say with him that the Church is of the bone and
   flesh of Christ, since for her sake the Logos left the Heavenly Father,
   and came down that he might cleave to his spouse; and he fell asleep
   unconscious of suffering, dying voluntarily for her, that he might
   present the Church to himself glorious and faultless, after he had
   purified her by the bath; so that she might receive the spiritual and
   blessed seed, which he himself, instilling and implanting, scatters
   into the depths of the Spirit, whom the Church receives and,
   fashioning, develops like a spouse, that she may bear and rear virtue.
   For in this way the word is also excellently fulfilled Grow and
   increase'; since the Church increases daily in greatness, beauty, and
   extent; because the Logos dwells with her, and holds communion with
   her, and he even now descends to us, and in remembrance (Anamnesis) of
   his suffering (continually) dies to himself. For not otherwise could
   the Church continually conceive believers in her womb, and bear them
   anew through the bath of regeneration, unless Christ were repeatedly to
   die, emptying himself for the sake of each individual, in order to find
   acceptance by means of his sufferings continuing and completing
   themselves; unless, descending from heaven, and united with his spouse,
   the Church, he imparted from his own side a certain power, that all who
   are edified in him should attain growth, those, namely, who, born again
   through baptism, have received flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,
   i.e., of his holiness and glory. He, however, who calls bone and flesh
   wisdom and virtue, speaks truly; but the side is the Spirit of truth,
   the Paraclete, from whom the enlightened receiving their portion are
   born again, in a worthy manner, to immortality. But no one can
   participate in the Holy Spirit, and be accounted a member of Christ,
   unless the Logos has first descended upon him, and, falling asleep, has
   emptied' himself, that he, rising again and rejuvenated, along with him
   who fell asleep for his sake, and re-fashioned in his own person, may
   participate in the Holy Spirit. For the side (pleura) of the Logos is
   really the spirit of truth, the seven-formed of the prophet, from whom
   God, in accordance with the self-sacrifice of Christ, that is, the
   incarnation and suffering of Christ, takes away something, and fashions
   for him his spouse, in other words, souls fit for him and prepared like
   a bride." [302]

   Methodius accordingly, starts in his speculations from Adam and Eve as
   the real types of Christ and the Church; but he then varies this,
   holding that the individual soul rather must become the bride of
   Christ, and that for each the descent of the Logos from heaven and his
   death must be repeated -- mysteriously and in the heart of the
   believer.

   This variation became, and precisely through the instrumentality of
   Methodius, of eminent importance in the history of dogma. [303] We
   would not have had in the third century all the premises from which
   Catholic Christianity was developed in the following centuries, unless
   this speculation had been brought forward, or, been given a central
   place, by a Christian theologian of the earlier period. It marks
   nothing less than the tapering of the realistic doctrinal system of the
   Church into the subjectivity of monkish mysticism. For to Methodius,
   the history of the Logos-Christ, as maintained by faith, was only the
   general background of an inner history, which required to repeat itself
   in each believer: the Logos had to descend from heaven, suffer, die,
   and rise again for him. Nay, Methodius already formulated his view to
   the effect that every believer must, through participation in Christ,
   be born as a Christ. [304] The background was, however, not a matter of
   indifference, seeing that what took place in the individual must have
   first taken place in the Church. The Church, accordingly, was to be
   revered as mother, by the individual soul which was to become the bride
   of Christ. In a word: here we have the theological speculation of the
   future monachism of the Church, and we see why it could not but pair
   with the loftiest obedience, and greatest devotion to the Church.

   But the evidence that we have really here the fundamental features of
   the monkish mysticism of the Church, is contained in the correct
   perception of the final object of the work from which the above details
   are taken. The whole writing seeks to represent the state of virginity
   as the condition of Christlikeness (I. 5, p. 13). Everything is
   directed to this end; yet marriage is not forbidden, but is admitted to
   possess a mystery of its own. Unstained virginity is ranked high above
   the married state; towards it all Christians must strive; it is the
   perfectly Christian life itself. Yet Methodius succeeds in maintaining,
   beside it, marriage and sin-stained birth from the flesh (II. 1 sq.).
   He had already arrived at the position of Catholic monasticism; the
   body belonging to the soul that would be the bride of Christ must
   remain virgin. The proper result of the work of Christ is represented
   in the state of virginity of the believers who still walk upon earth,
   and it is the bloom of imperishableness:

   "Exceedingly great and wonderful and glorious is virginity, and to
   speak plainly, following Holy Scripture, this most noble and fair
   practice is alone the ripe result, the flower and first fruits of
   incorruption, and therefore the Lord promises to admit "those who have
   preserved their virginity into the kingdom of heaven . . . for we must
   understand that virginity, while walking "upon the earth, reaches the
   heavens":

   megale tis estin huperphuos kai thaumaste kai endoxos he parthenia, kai
   ei chre phaneros eipein epomenen tais hagiais graphais, to outhar tes
   aphtharsias kai to anthos kai he aparche autes touto to ariston kai
   kalliston epitedeuma monon tunchanei, kai dia tauta kai ho kurios eis
   ten basileian eiselasai ton ouranon tous apopartheneusantas sphas
   autous epangelletai . . . , parthenian gar bainein men epi ges,
   epipsauein de ton ouranon hegeteon (Conv. I. 1, p. 11).

   Methodius started from other premises than the school of Origen, and
   bitterly opposed the latter, but in the end he came to the same
   practical result -- witness the followers of Hieracas. Their
   speculations also led to the depreciation of the objective redemption,
   and to monachism. But the concrete forms were very different. In Origen
   himself and his earliest disciples the Church was by no means really
   the mother, or, if it were, it was in a wholly different sense from
   that of Methodius. Asceticism and in particular virginity were not in
   themselves valuable, an end in themselves, but means to the end.
   Finally, Gnosis (knowledge) was different from Pistis (faith), and the
   ideal was the perfect Gnostic, who is freed from all that is alien and
   fleeting, and lives in the eternal and abiding. Methodius' teaching was
   different. Pistis and Gnosis were related to each other as theme and
   exposition: there is only one truth, which is the same for all; but on
   the soil of the Church there is room for the state of virginity, which
   is the goal of the incarnation, though all may not yet reach it. The
   important and momentous achievement of Methodius [305] consisted in
   subordinating a realistic Church theology, which yet was not destitute
   of a speculative phase, and even made a moderate use of the allegorical
   method, to the practical object of securing virginity, a life in which
   God and Christ were imitated, (Conv. I. 5, p. 13: to imitate God is to
   escape from corruption [homoiosis Theo phthoras apophuge]; Christ is
   not only arch-shepherd and arch-prophet [archipoimen-archiporophetes],
   but also archetypal virgin [archiparthnos]). This doctrine, as well as
   the practical attitude of Hieracas, and many other features, as, e.g.,
   the considerably earlier Pseudo-Clementine epistles "De virginitate,"
   [306] prove that the great aspiration of the time in the East was
   towards monachism, and Methodius succeeded in uniting this with a
   Church theology. In spite of his polemic against Origen he did not
   despise those phases of the latter's theology, which were at all
   compatible with the traditional comprehension of religious doctrine.
   Thus he accepted the doctrine of the Logos implicitly in the form given
   to it by Origen's school, without, of course, entangling himself in the
   disputed terminology (see, e.g., De creat. 11, p. 102); so far as I
   know, he made no express defence of Chiliasm, in spite of the high
   value he put on the Apocalypse. He is even said by Socrates (H. E. VI.
   13) to have admired Origen, in one of his latest writings, "a sort of
   recantation" (hos ek palinodias). However that may be, the future
   belonged not to Origen, nor to the scientific religion that soared
   above faith, but to compromises, such as those, stamped with monachism,
   which Methodius concluded, to the combination of realistic and
   speculative elements, of the objectivity of the Church and the
   mysticism of the monks. [307] The great fight in the next decades was
   undoubtedly to be fought out between two forms of the doctrine of the
   Logos; the one, that of Lucian the martyr and his school, which had
   adopted elements distinctive of Adoptianism, and the other, professed
   by Alexander of Alexandria and the Western theologians, which with
   Sabellianism held fast the unity of the divine nature. But, in the case
   of the majority of Eastern Christians in the 4th century, the
   background or basis of these opposite views was formed, not by a
   theology purely Origenist, but by one of compromise, which had resulted
   from a combination of the former with the popular idea of the rules of
   faith, and which sought its goal, not in an absolute knowledge and the
   calm confidence of the pious sage, but in virginity, ecclesiasticism,
   and a mystical deification. Men like Methodius became of the highest
   consequence in the development of this theological genus, which,
   indeed, could not but gain the upper hand more and more, from the
   elemental force of factors existent in the Church. [308]

   But while as regards Origen's theology reservations may have gradually
   grown stronger and more numerous in the course of the next decades,
   theological speculation aimed in the East, from about 250-320, at a
   result than which nothing grander or more assured could be imagined. In
   the West the old, short, Creed was retained, and, except in one case,
   [309] the Christological conflicts did not induce men to change it. But
   in the leading Churches of the East, and during the given period, the
   Creeds were expanded by theological additions, [310] and thus
   exegetical and speculative theology was introduced into the Apostolic
   faith itself. [311] Thus, in the Catholic Churches of the East, this
   theology was for ever fused with the faith itself. A striking example
   has been already quoted; those six Bishops who wrote against Paul of
   Samosata in the seventh decade of the third century, submitted a Rule
   of Faith, which had been elaborated philosophically and theologically,
   as the faith handed down in the holy Catholic Church from the Apostles
   [312] But we possess numerous other proofs. Gregory of Nyssa tells us
   that from the days of Gregory Thaumaturgus till his own, the Creed of
   the latter formed the foundation of the instruction given to
   catechumens in Neo-C√¶sarea. But this Creed [313] was neither more nor
   less than a compendium of Origen's theology, [314] which, here, was
   thus introduced into the faith and instruction of the Church. Further,
   it is clear from the letter of Alexander of Alexandria to Alexander of
   Constantinople, that the Church of Alexandria possessed at that time a
   Creed which had been elaborated theologically. [315] After the Bishop
   has quoted extensive portions of it, which he describes as "the whole
   pious Apostolic doctrine" (pasa he apostolike eusebes doxa), he closes
   with the words "these things we teach and preach, that is the Apostolic
   dogmas of the Church" (tauta didaskomen, tauta keruttomen, tauta tes
   ekklesias ta apostolika dogmata) But these dogmas belong to Origen's
   theology. Finally, we perceive from the Nicene transactions, that many
   Churches then possessed Creeds, which contained the Biblical
   theological formulas of Origen. We may assert this decidedly of the
   Churches of C√¶sarea, Jerusalem, and Antioch. [316] The entire
   undertaking of the Fathers of the Nicene Council to set up a
   theological Creed to be observed by the whole Church, would have been
   impossible, had not the Churches, or at least the chief Churches, of
   the East already been accustomed to such Symbols. These Churches had
   thus passed, in the generations immediately preceding the Nicene,
   through a Creed-forming period, to which little attention has hitherto
   been paid. In its beginning and its course it is wholly obscure, but it
   laid the foundation for the development of theological dogmatics,
   peculiar to the Church, in the fourth and fifth centuries. It laid the
   foundation  -- for the following epoch was distinguished from this one
   by the fact that the precise definitions demanded by the doctrine of
   redemption, as contained within the frame-work of Origen's theology,
   were fixed and made exclusive. Thus the dangers were guarded against,
   which rose out of the circumstance, that the philosophical theory of
   God, and the idea of the Logos which belonged to it, had been received
   into the system of religion, i.e., the Neo-platonic method and circle
   of ideas had been legitimised, without the traditional tenets of the
   faith having been sufficiently protected against them. In the new
   Creeds of the period 260-325 we find the conditions to hand for a
   system of religion based on the philosophical doctrine of God, a system
   specifically belonging to the Church, completely expressed in fixed and
   technical terms, and scientific. We find the conditions ready -- but
   nothing more, or less. But it was also due to the Creeds that in after
   times every controversy of the schools necessarily became a conflict
   that moved and shook the Church to its very depths. The men, however,
   who in the fourth and fifth centuries made orthodox dogma, were
   undoubtedly influenced, to a greater degree than their predecessors of
   from A.D. 260-315, by specifically Church ideas; and their work, if we
   measure it by the mixture of ideas and methods which they received from
   tradition, was eminently a conservative reduction and securing of
   tradition, so far as that was still in their possession. It was really
   a new thing, a first step of immeasurable significance, when Athanasius
   staked his whole life on the recognition of a single attribute -- the
   consubstantiality -- of Christ, and rejected all others as being liable
   to pagan misinterpretation.

   At the beginning of the fourth century, Rules of Faith and theology
   were differently related to each other in the Churches of the East and
   West. In the latter, the phraseology of the primitive Creed was
   strictly adhered to, and a simple antignostic interpretation was
   thought sufficient, by means of formulas like "Father, Son, and Spirit:
   one God" -- "Jesus Christ, God and man" -- "Jesus Christ, the Logos,
   wisdom, and power of God" In the former, theological formulas were
   admitted into the Confession of Faith itself, which was thus shaped
   into a theological compendium ostensibly coming from the Apostles. But
   in both cases, the personal reality, and, with it, the pre-existence of
   the divinity manifested in Christ, were recognised by the vast
   majority; [317] they were included in the instruction given to
   Catechumens; they furnished the point of view from which men sought to
   understand the Person of Christ. And, accordingly, the accurate
   definition of the relation of the Deity to that other divine nature
   which appeared on earth necessarily became the chief problem of the
   future.

   on Hippolytus and the origin of the Philosophumena, as also on the
   authorities for the history of the early heretics, come in here. See
   also Caspari, Quellen III., vv. ll. The authorites are for No√´tus, the
   Syntagma of Hippolytus (Epiph., Philaster, Pseudo-Tertull.), and his
   great work against Monarchianism, of which the so-called Homilia
   Hippolutou eis ten hairesin Noetou tinos (Lagarde, Hippol. qu√¶
   feruntur, p. 43 sq.) may with extreme probability be held to be the
   conclusion. Both these works have been made use of by Epiph. H. 57.
   [When Epiph. (l.c. ch. 1) remarks that "No√´tus appeared ¬± 130 years
   ago", it is to be inferred that he fixed the date from his authority,
   the anti-monarchian work of Hippolytus. For the latter he must have had
   a date, which he believed he could simply transfer to the period of
   No√´tus, since No√´tus is described in the book as ou pro pollou chronou
   genomenos. But in that case his source was written about A.D. 230-240,
   i.e., almost at the same time as the so-called Little Labyrinth. It is
   also possible, however, that the above date refers to the
   excommunication of No√´tus. In that case the work which has recorded
   this event, can have been written at the earliest in the fourth decade
   of the fourth century]. Most of the later accounts refer to that of
   Epiph. An independent one is the section Philos. IX. 7 sq. (X. 27; on
   this Theodoret is dependent H. F. III. 3). For Epigonus and Cleomenes
   we have Philos. IX. 7, 10, 11, X. 27; Theodoret H. F. III. 3. For
   √Üschines: Pseudo-Tertull. 26; Philos. VIII. 19, X. 26; for Praxeas:
   Tertull. adv. Prax., Pseudo-Tertull. 30. The later Latin writers
   against heretics are at this point all dependent on Tertullian; yet see
   Optat., de schism. I. 9. Lipsius has tried to prove that Tertullian has
   used "Hippolytus against No√´tus" in his work adv. Prax.
   (Quellen-kritik, p. 43; Ketzergeschichte, p. 183 f.; Jahrbuch f√ºr
   deutsche Theologie, 1868, p. 704); but the attempt is not successful
   (see Ztschr. f. d. hist. Theol., 1874, p. 200 f.). For Victorinus we
   have Pseudo-Tertull. 30. For Zephyrinus and Callistus: Philos. IX. 11
   sq. Origen has also had Roman Monarchians in view in many of the
   arguments in his commentaries. On Origen's residence in Rome and his
   relations with Hippolytus, see Euseb. H. E. VI. 14; Jerome, De vir.

   nomizomenon. Origen has elsewhere distinguished four grades in
   religion: (1) those who worship idols, (2) those who worship angelic
   powers, (3) these to whom Christ is the entire God, (4) those whose
   thoughts rise to the unchangeable deity. Clement (Strom. VI. 10) had
   already related that there were Christians who, in their dread of
   heresy, demanded that everything should be abandoned as superfluous and
   alien, which did not tend directly to blessedness.

   [129] See above (Vol. I., p. 195) where reference is made, on the one
   hand, to the Modalism reflected in Gnostic and Enkratitic circles
   (Gosp. of the Egypt., and Acta Lenc., Simonians in Iren. I. 231); on
   the other, to the Church formulas phrased, or capable of being
   interpreted, modalistically (see II. Ep. of Clement, Ign. ad Ephes.,
   Melito [Syr. Fragments]; and in addition, passages which speak of God
   having suffered, died, etc.). It is instructive to notice that the
   development in Marcionite Churches and Montanist communities moved
   parallel to that in the great Church. Marcion himself, being no
   dogmatist, did not take any interest in the question of the relation of
   Christ to the higher God. Therefore it is not right to reckon him among
   the Modalists, as Neander has done (Gnost. Syxteme, p. 294,
   Kirchengesch. I. 2. p. 796). But it is certain that later Marcionites
   in the West taught Patripassianism (Ambros. de fide V. 13. 162, T. II.,
   p. 579; Ambrosiaster ad I. Cor. II. 2, T. II., App. p. 117).
   Marcionites and Sabellians were therefore at a later date not seldom
   classed together. Among the Montanists at Rome there were, about A.D.
   200, a Modalistic party and one that taught like Hippolytus; at the
   head of the former stood √Üschines, at the head of the latter Proculus.
   Of the followers of √Üschines, Hippolytus says (Philos. X. 26) that
   their doctrine was that of No√´tus: auton einai huion kai patera,
   horaton kai aoraton; genneton kai agenneton, thneton kai athanaton. It
   is rather an idle question whether Montanus himself and the prophetic
   women taught Modalism. They certainly used formulas which had a
   Modalistic sound; but they had also others which could afterwards be
   interpreted and could not but be interpreted "economically". In the
   Test. of the XII. Patriarchs many passages that, in the Jewish
   original, spoke of Jehovah's appearance among his people must now have
   received a Christian impress from their Christian editor. It is
   remarkable that, living in the third century, he did not scruple to do
   this, see Simeon 6: hoti ho kurios ho Theos megas tou Israel,
   phainomenos epi ges hos anthropos kai sozon en auto ton Adam . . . hoti
   ho Theos soma labon kai sunesthion anthropois esosen anthropous; Levi
   5, Jud. 22, Issachar. 7: echontes meth' heauton ton Theon tou ouranou,
   sumporeuomenon tois anthropois: Zebul. 9: hopsesthe Theon en schemati
   anthropou; Dan. 5; Naphth. 8: ophthesetai Theos katoikon en anthropois
   epi tes ges: Asher 7: heos hou ho hupsistos episkepsetai ten gen, kai
   autos elthon hos anthropos meta anthropon esthion kai pinon; Benjamin
   10. Very different Christologies, however, can be exemplified from the
   Testaments. It is not certain what sort of party Philaster (H. 51)
   meant (Lipsius Ketzergesch., p. 99 f.). In the third century Modalism
   assumed various forms, among which the conception of a formal
   transformation of God into man, and a real transition of the one into
   the other, is noteworthy. An exclusive Modalistic doctrine first
   existed in the Church after the fight with Gnosticism.

   [131] That the scientific defenders of Modalism adopted the Stoic
   method -- just as the Theodotians had the Aristotelian (see above) --
   is evident, and Hippolytus was therefore so far correct in connecting
   No√´tus with Heraclitas, i.e., with the father of the Stoa. To Hagemann
   belongs the merit (R√∂m. Kirche, pp. 354-371) of having demonstrated the
   traces of Stoic Logic and Metaphysics in the few and imperfectly
   transmitted tenets of the Modalists. (See here Hatch, The influence
   etc., p. 19 f. on the supaschein and the substantial unity of psuche
   and soma). We can still recognise, especially from Novatian's
   refutation, the syllogistic method of the Modalists, which rested on
   nominalist, i.e., Stoic, logic. See, e.g., the proposition: "Si unus
   deus Christus, Christus autem deus, pater est Christus, quia unus deus;
   si non pater sit Christus, dum et deus filius Christus, duo dii contra
   scripturas introducti videantur." But those utterances in which
   contradictory attributes, such as visible-invisible etc., are ascribed
   to God, could be excellently supported by the Stoic system of
   categories. That system distinguished idia (ousia, hupokeimenon) from
   sumbebekota, or more accurately (1) hupokeimena (substrata, subjects of
   judgment); (2) poia (qualitatives); (3) pos echonta (definite
   modifications) and (4) pros ti pos echonta (relative modifications).
   Nos. 2-4 form the qualities of the idea as a sunkechuomenon; but 2 and
   3 belong to the conceptual sphere of the subject itself, while 4
   embraces the variable relation of the subject to other subjects. The
   designations Father and Son, visible and invisible etc., must be
   conceived as such relative, accidental, attributes. The same subject
   can in one relation be Father, in another Son, or, according to
   circumstances, be visible or invisible. One sees that this logical
   method could be utilised excellently to prove the simple unreasoned
   propositions of the old Modalism. There are many traces to show that
   the system was applied in the schools of Epigonus and Cleomenes, and it
   is with schools we have here to deal. Thus, e.g., we have the
   accusation which, time and again, Origen made against the Monarchians,
   that they only assume one hupokeimenon, and combine Father and Son
   indiscriminately as modes in which it is manifested. (Hagemann refers
   to Orig. on Matt. XVI. 14: hoi suncheontes patros kai huiou ennoian;
   and on John X. 21: suncheomenoi en to peri patros kai huiou topo -- but
   suncheein is the Stoic term). The proposition is also Stoic that while
   the one hupokeimenon is capable of being divided (diarein), it is only
   subjectively, in our conceptions of it (te epinoia mone), so that
   merely onomata not differences kath' hupostasin, result. Further, the
   conception of the Logos as a mere sound is verbally that of the Stoics,
   who defined the phone (logos) as aer peplegmenos e to idion aistheton
   akoes. Tertullian adv. Prax.7; "quid est enim, dices, sermo nisi vox et
   sonus oris et sicut grammatici tradunt, a√´r offensus, intelligibilis
   auditu, ceterum vacuum nescio quid et inane et incorporale?" Hippolyt.,
   Philos. X. 33: Theos logon apogenna, ou logon hos phonen. Novatian, de
   trinit. 31: "sermo filius natus est, qui non in sono percussi a√´ris aut
   tono coact√¶ de visceribus vocis accipitur." The application of
   Nominalist Logic and Stoic Methaphysics to theology was discredited in
   the controversy with the Modalists under the names of "godless
   science", or "the science of the unbelievers", just as much as
   Aristotelian philosophy had been in the fight with the Adoptians.
   Therefore, even as early as about A.D. 250, one of the most rancorous
   charges levelled at Novatian by his enemies was that he was a follower
   of another, i.e., of the Stoic, philosophy (Cornelius ap. Euseb. H. E.
   VI. 43. 16; Cypr. Ep. 55. 24, 60. 3). Novatian incurred this reproach
   because he opposed the Monarchians with their own, i.e., the
   syllogistic, method, and because he had maintained, as was alleged,
   imitating the Stoics, "omnia peccata paria esse." Now if the philosophy
   of Adoptian scholars was Aristotelian, and that of Modalistic scholars
   was Stoic, so the philosophy of Tatian, Tertullian, Hippolytus, and
   Origen, in reference to the One and Many, and the real evolutions
   (merismos) of the one to the many is unmistakably Platonic. Hagemann
   (l.c. pp. 182-206) has shown the extent to which the expositions of
   Plotinus (or Porphyry) coincide in contents and form, method and
   expression -- see especially the conception of Hypostasis (substance)
   in Plotinus -- with those of the Christian theologians mentioned, among
   whom we have to include Valentinus. (See also Hipler in the √∂str.
   Vierteljahrsschr. f. Kath. Theol. 1869, p. 161 ff., quoted after
   L√∂sche, Ztschr. f. wiss. Theol. 1884, p. 259). When the Logos
   Christology triumphed completely in the Church at the end of the third
   century, Neoplatonism also triumphed over Aristotelianism and Stoicism
   in ecclesiastical science, and it was only in the West that
   theologians, like Arnobius, were tolerated who in their pursuit of
   Christian knowledge rejected Platonism.

   [132] Hippol. c. No√´t. I., Philos. IX. 7.

   [133] Epiph. l.c., ch. I.

   [134] According to Hippol. c. No√´t. I., he was not condemned after the
   first trial, but only at the close of a second, -- a proof of the
   uncertainty that still prevailed. It is impossible now to discover what
   ground there was for the statement that No√´tus gave himself out to be
   Moses, and his brother to be Aaron.

   [135] The fact that No√´tus was able to live for years in Asia Minor
   undisturbed, has evidently led Theodoret into the mistake that he was a
   later Monarchian who only appeared after Epigonus and Cleomenes. For
   the rest, Hippolytus used the name of No√´tus in his attack on him,
   simply as a symbol under which to oppose later Monarchians (see Ztschr.
   f. d. hist. Theol. 1874, p. 201); this is at once clear from ch. 2.

   [136] Philos. IX. 12: Houtos ho Kallistos meta ten tou Zephurinou
   teleuten nomizon tetuchekenai hou etherato, ton Sabellion apeosen hos
   me phronounta orthos, dedoikos eme kai nomizon houto dunasthai
   apotripsasthai ten pros tas ekklesias kategorian, hos me allotrios
   phronon. Hippolytus, whose treatment of Sabellius is respectful,
   compared with his attitude to Callistus, says nothing of his own
   excommunication; it is therefore possible that he and his small faction
   had already separated from Callistus, and for their part had put him
   under the ban. This cannot have happened under Zephyrine, as is shown
   directly by Philos. IX. 11, and all we can infer from ch. 7 is that the
   party of Hippolytus had ceased to recognise even Zephyrine as Bishop;
   so correctly D√∂llinger, l.c., p. 101 f., 223 f., a different view in
   Lipsius, Ketzergeschichte, p. 150. The situation was doubtless this:
   Epigonus and Cleomenes had founded a real school (didaskaleion) in the
   Roman Church, perhaps in opposition to that of the Theodotians, and
   this school was protected by the Roman bishops. (s. Philos. IX. 7:
   Zephurinos [to kerdei prospheromeno teithomenos] sunechorei tois
   prosiousi to Kleomenei matheteuesthai . . . Touton kata diadochen
   diemeine to didaskaleion kratunomenon kai epauxon dia to sunairesthai
   autois ton Sephurinon kai ton Kalliston). Hippolytus attacked the
   orthodoxy and Church character of the school, which possessed the
   sympathy of the Roman community, and he succeeded, after Sabellius had
   become its head, in getting Callistus to expel the new leader from the
   Church. But he himself was likewise excommunicated on account of his
   Christology, his "rigourism" and his passionate agitations. At the
   moment the community of Callistus was no longer to him a Catholic
   Church, but a didaskaleion (see Philos. IX. 12, p 458, 1; p. 462, 42).

   [137] The attempt has been made in the above to separate the historical
   kernel from the biassed description of Hippolytus in the Philos. His
   account is reproduced most correctly by Caspari (Quellen III., p. 325
   ff.). Hippolytus has not disguised the fact that the Bishops had the
   great mass of the Roman community on their side (IX. 11), but he has
   everywhere scented hypocrisy, intrigues and subserviency, where it is
   evident to the present day that the Bishops desired to protect the
   Church from the rabies theologorum. In so doing, they only did what
   their office demanded, and acted in the spirit of their predecessors,
   in whose days the acceptance of the brief and broad Church confession
   was alone decisive, while beyond that freedom ruled. It is also evident
   that Hippolytus considered Zephyrine and the rest a set of ignorant
   beings (idiotes), because they would not accede to the new science and
   the "economic" conception of God.

   [138] According to Pseudo-Tertull. 30, where in fact the name of
   Praxeas is substituted for No√´tus.

   [147] Pseudo-Tertull.: Praxeas quidem h√¶resim introduxit quam
   Victorinus corroborare curavit. This Victorinus is rightly held by most
   scholars to be Bishop Victor; (1) there is the name (on Victor =
   Victorinus, see Langen l c., p. 196; Caspari, Quellen III., p. 323, n.
   102); (2) the date; (3) the expression "curavit" which points to a high
   position, and is exactly paralleled by the sunai'resthai used by
   Hippolytus in referring to Zephyrine and Callistus (see p. 58, note 1);
   lastly, the fact that Victor's successors, as we know definitely, held
   Monarchian views. The excommunication of Theodotus by Victor proves
   nothing, of course, to the contrary; for the Monarchianism of this man
   was of quite a different type from that of Praxeas.

   [148] This is definitely to be inferred from the words of Tertullian
   (l.c.): "Fructicaverant aven√¶ Praxean√¶ hic quoque superseminat√¶
   dormientibus multis in simplicitate doctrin√¶"; see Caspari, l.c.;
   Hauck, Tertullian, p. 368; Langen, l.c., p. 199; on the other side

   Philos. IX. 11, fin. 12: demosia ho Kallistos hemin oneidizei eipein;
   ditheoi este. From c. No√´t. 11 it appears that the Monarchians opposed
   the doctrine of the Logos, because it led to the Gnostic doctrine of
   √Üons. Hippolytus had to reply: tis apophai'netai ple'thun Theon
   paraballome'nen kata` kairou's. He sought to show (ch. 14 sq.) that the
   muste'rion oikonomi'as, of the Trinity taught by him was something
   different from the doctrine of the √Üons.

   [156] Hippol. (c. No√´t. I.) makes his opponent say, ti oun kakon poio
   doxa'zon to`n Christo'n; see also ch. II. sq.; see again ch. IX. where
   Hippolytus says to his opponents that the Son must be revered in the
   way defined by God in Holy Scriptures.

   [159] We perceive very clearly here that we have before us not an
   unstudied, but a thought-out, and theological Modalism. As it was
   evident, in the speculations about Melchisedec of the Theodotians, that
   they, like Origen, desired to rise from the crucified Jesus to the
   eternal, godlike Son, so these Modalists held the conception, that the
   Father himself was to be perceived in Jesus, to be one which was only
   meant for those who could grasp it.

   [162] It is interesting to notice that in the Abyssinian Church of
   to-day there is a theological school which teaches a threefold birth of
   Christ, from the Father in eternity, from the virgin, and from the Holy
   Ghost at the Baptism; see Herzog, R. E., 2 Aufl., Bd. I., p. 70.

   pr√¶dicuntur." c. 19: "igitur si propterea eundem et patrem et filium
   credendum putaverunt, ut unum deum vindicent etc." c. 23: "ut sic duos
   divisos diceremus, quomodo iactitatis etc."

   [166] C. 8: "Hoc si qui putaverit me probolen aliquam introducer," says
   Tertullian "quod facit Valentinus, etc."

   [167] See C. 14. 15: "Hic ex diverso volet aliquis etiam filium
   invisibilem contendere, ut sermonem, ut spiritum . . . Nam et illud
   adiiciunt ad argumentationem, quod si filius tunc (Exod. 33) ad Moysen
   loquebatur, ipse faciem suam nemini visibilem pronuntiaret, quia scil.
   ipse invisibilis pater fuerit in filii nomine. Ac per hoc si eundem
   volunt accipi et visibilem et invisibilem, quomodo eundem patrem et
   filium . . . Ergo visibilis et invisibilis idem, et quia utrumque, ideo
   et ipse pater invisibilis, qua et filius, visibilis . . .
   Argumentantur, recte utrumque dictum, visibilem quidem in carne,
   invisibilem vero ante carnem, ut idem sit pater invisibilis ante
   carnem, qui et filius visibilis in carne."

   [168] Thus to Exod. XXXIII. (ch. 14), Rev. I. 18 (ch. 17), Isa XXIV. 24
   (ch. 19), esp. John X. 30; XIV. 9, 10 (ch. 20), Isa. XLV. 5 (ch. 20).
   They admit that in the Scriptures sometimes two, sometimes one, are
   spoken of; but they argued (ch 18): Ergo quia duos et unum invenimus,
   ideo ambo unus atque idem et filius et pater."

   [169] Ch. 10: "Ipse se sibi filium fecit."

   [170] Ch. 11: "Porro qui eundem patrem dicis et filium, eundem et
   protulisse ex semetipso facis."

   [171] To this verse the Monarchians, according to ch. 10, appealed, and
   they quoted as a parallel the birth from the virgin.

   [172] Ch. 27: "√Üque in una persona utrumque distinguunt, patrem et
   filium, discentes filium carnem esse, id est hominem, id est Iesum,
   patrem autem spiritum, id est deum, id est Christum." On this
   Tertullian remarks: "et qui unum eundemque contendunt patrem et filium,
   iam incipiunt dividere illos potius quam unare; talem monarchiam apud
   Valentinum fortasse didicerunt, duos facere Iesum et Christum."
   Tertullian, accordingly, tries to retort on his opponents the charge of
   dissolving the Monarchia; see even ch. 4. The attack on the assumption
   of a transformation of the divine into the human does not, for the
   rest, affect these Monarchians (ch. 27 ff.).

   [173] See ch. 26, 27: "propterea quod nascetur sanctum, vocabitur
   filius dei; caro itaque nata est, caro itaque erit filius dei."

   [174] Ch. 29: "mortuus est non ex divina, sed ex humana substantia."

   [175] L. c.: "Compassus est pater filio."

   apparently the very formula "Compassus est pater filio" that appeared
   unacceptable to the strict Monarchians.

   [180] Catholic theologians endeavour to give a Nicene interpretation to
   the theses of Callistus, and to make Hippolytus a ditheist; see
   Hagemann, l.c.; Kuhn, Theol. Quartalschrift, 1885, II.; Lehir, √âtudes
   bibliques, II., p. 383; de Rossi and various others.

   [181] This is also Zahn's view, Marcell., p. 214. The doctrine of
   Callistus is for the rest so obscure, -- and for this our informant
   does not seem to be alone to blame -- that, when we pass from it to the
   Logos Christology, we actually breathe freely, and we can understand
   how the latter simpler and compact doctrine finally triumphed over the
   laboured and tortuous theses of Callistus.

   [182] See the Christology of Origen.

   [183] See Vol. II., p. 256.

   [184] This can be clearly perceived by comparing the Christology of
   Tertullian and Hippolytus with that of Iren√¶us.

   [185] See Tertullian adv. Prax. 3; Hippol. c. No√´t. 11.

   [186] Adv. Prax. 8, 13. It is the same with Hippolytus; both have in
   their attacks on the Modalists taken Valentine, comparatively speaking,
   under their protection. This is once more a sign that the doctrine of
   the Church was modified Gnosticism.

   [187] Ch. 18, in other passages otherwise.

   [188] Tertull. adv. Prax. 2. Hippol. c. No√´t. I.

   [189] The Monarchian dispute was conducted on both sides by the aid of
   proofs drawn from exegesis. Tertullian, besides, in Adv. Prax.,
   appealed in support of the "economic" trinity to utterances of the
   Paraclete.

   [190] See ad. Prax. 21: "Ceterum Iudaic√¶ fidei ista res, sic unum deum
   credere, ut filium adnumerare ei nolis, et post filium spiritum. Quid
   enim erit inter nos et illos nisi differentia ista? Quod opus
   evangelii, si non exinde pater et filius et spiritus, tres crediti,
   unum deum sistunt?"

   [191] Pisteusomen, says Hippolyt. c. No√´t. 17 -- kata ten paradosin ton
   apostolon hoti Theos logos ap' ouranon katelthen, -- see already
   Tatian, Orat. 5 following Joh. I. 1: Theos en en arche, ten de archen
   logou dunamin pareilephamen.

   [192] See above, p. 63.

   [193] In the Symbolum the "gennethenta ek pneumatos hagiou" is to be
   understood as explaining ton huion tou Theou.

   [194] See Adv. Prax. 16.

   [195] On these grounds the doctrine of Sabellius will be described
   under, in the history of Eastern Modalism.

   [196] In forged Acts of Synod of the 6th century we read (Mansi,
   Concil. II., p. 621): "qui se Callistus ita docuit Sabellianum, ut
   arbitrio suo sumat unam personam esse trinitatis." The words which
   follow later, "in sua extollentia separabat trinitatem" have without
   reason seemed particularly difficult to D√∂llinger (l.c., p. 247) and
   Langen (l.c., p. 215). Sabellianism was often blamed with dismembering
   the Monas (see Zahn, Marcell. p. 211.)

   [197] See D√∂llinger, l.c., Hippolytus was under Maximinus banished
   along with the Roman Bishop Pontian to Sardinia. See the Catal. Liber.
   sub "Pontianus" (Lipsius, Chronologic, pp. 194, 275).

   [198] This writing shows, on the one hand, that Adoptians and Modalists
   still existed and were dangerous in Rome, and on the other, that they
   were not found within the Roman Church. On the significance of the
   writing see Vol. II., p. 313 f.

   [199] The Roman doctrine of Christ was then as follows: He has always
   been with the Father (sermo dei), but he first proceeded before the
   world from the substance of the Father (ex patre) for the purpose of
   creating the world. He was born into the flesh, and thus as filius dei
   and deus adopted a homo; thus he is also filius hominis. "Filius dei"
   and "filius hominis" are thus to be distinguished as two substances
   (substantia divina -- homo), but he is one person; for he has
   completely combined, united, and fused the two substances in himself.
   At the end of things, when he shall have subjected all to himself, he
   will subject himself again to the Father, and will return to and be
   merged in him. Of the Holy Spirit it is also true, that he is a person
   (Paraclete), and that he proceeds from the substance of the Father; but
   he receives from the Son his power and sphere of work, he is therefore
   less than the Son, as the latter is less than the Father. But all three
   persons are combined as indwellers in the same substance, and united by
   love and harmony. Thus there is only one God, from whom the two other
   persons proceed.

   Routh, Reliq. S. III., p. 373

   [201] Expos. Symboli Apost. ch. 19. The changes which can be shown to
   have been made on the first article of the Creed elsewhere in the West
   -- see especially the African additions -- belong probably at the
   earliest to the fourth century. Should they be older, however, they are
   all, it would seem, to be understood anti-gnostically; in other words,
   they contain nothing but explanations and comfirmatory additions. It is
   in itself incredible and incapable of proof that the Roman and after it
   the Western Churches should, at the beginning of the third century,
   have deleted, as Zahn holds, a hena which originally stood in the first
   article of the Creed, in order to confute the Monarchians.

   [202] See Vol. IV.

   [203] We, unfortunately, do not know on what grounds the Roman Bishop
   approved of the excommunication of Origen, or whether Origen's doctrine
   of subordination was regarded in Rome as heretical.

   [204] Here follow in the original illustrations which we relegate to
   this footnote. Compare Instruct. II. 1 (Heading): "De populo absconso
   sancto omnipotentis Christi dei vivi;" II. 1, p. 28. 22, ed. Ludwig):
   "omnipotens Christus descendit ad suos electos;" II. 23, p. 43, 11 sq.:
   "Unde deus clamat: Stulte, hac nocte vocaris." II. 39. 1, p. 52. Carmen
   apolog. 91 sq.: "Est deus omnipotens, unus, a semetipso creatus, quem
   infra reperies magnum et humilem ipsum. Is erat in verbo positus, sibi
   solo notatus, Qui pater et filius dicitur et spiritus sanctus;" 276:
   "Hic pater in filio venit, deus unus ubique." (See also the following
   verses according to the edition of Dombart): 285: "hic erat
   Omnipotens;" 334: "(ligno) deus pependit dominus;" 353: "deum talia
   passum, Ut enuntietur crucifixus conditor orbis;" 359 sq.: "Idcirco nec
   voluit se manifestare, quid esset, Sed filium dixit se missum fuisse a
   patre;" 398: "Pr√¶dictus est deus carnaliter nasci pro nobis;" 455:
   "quis deus est ille, quem nos crucifiximus;" 610: "ipsa spes tota, deo
   credere, qui ligno pependit;" 612: "Quod filius dixit, cum sit deus
   pristinus ipse;" 625: "hic erat venturus, commixtus sanguine nostro, ut
   videretur homo, sed deus in carne latebat . . . dominus ipse veniet."
   630, 764: "Unus est in c√¶lo deus dei, terr√¶ marisque, Quem Moyses
   docuit ligno pependisse pro nobis;" etc. etc. Commodian is usually
   assigned to the second half of the third century, but doubts have
   recently been expressed as to this date. Jacobi, Commodian u. d. alt

   Erkentnisslehre des Arnobius (Leipzig, 1878).

   [208] We recall the Theodotians of Rome.

   [209] See Instit. IV. 6-30. The doctrine of the Logos is naturally
   worked out in a subordinationist sense. Besides this, many other things
   occur which must have seemed very questionable to the Latin Fathers 60
   years afterwards: "Utinam," says Jerome, "tam nostra confirmare
   potuisset quam facile aliena destruxit."

   [210] Commod., Carmen apolog. 761.

   [211] See the Christological expositions, in part extremely
   questionable, of Arnobius I. 39, 42, 53, 60, 62, and elsewhere. A.
   demands that complete divinity should be predicated of Christ on
   account of the divine teaching of Christ (II. 60). In his own theology
   many other antique features crop up; he even defends the view that the
   supreme God need not be conceived as creator of this world and of men
   (see the remarkable chap. 46 of the second book, which recalls Marcion
   and Celsus). Many Church doctrines Arnobius cannot understand, and he
   admits them to be puzzles whose solution is known to God alone (see
   e.g., B. II. 74). Even in the doctrine of the soul, which to him is
   mortal and only has its life prolonged by receiving the doctrine
   brought by Christ, there is a curious mixture of antique empiricism and
   Christianity. If we measure him by the theology of the fourth century,
   Arnobius is heterodox on almost every page.

   [212] See the Carmen apolog. with its detailed discussions of the final
   Drama, Antichrist (Nero) etc.; Lactant IV. 12, VII. 21 sq.; Victorinus,
   Comm. on Revelation.

   [213] We can notice throughout in Commodian the influence of the
   institution of penance, that measuring-tape of the extent to which
   Church and World are entwined.

   [214] The oldest commentary preserved, in part, to us is that of
   Victorinus of Pettan on the Apocalypse.

   [215] The work of Arnobius is, in this respect, very instructive. This
   theologian did not incline as a theologian to Neoplatonism, at a time
   when, in the East, the use of any other philosophy in Christian
   dogmatics was ipso facto forbidden as heretical.

   [216] Epiphanius (H. 62. 1) tells us that there were Sabellians in Rome
   in his time. Since he was acquainted with no other province or
   community in the West we may perhaps believe him. This information
   seems to be confirmed by a discovery made in A.D. 1742 by Marangoni.
   "He found at the Marancia gate on the road leading to S. Paolo a stair
   closed in his time which, as the discoverer believed, led to a
   cubiculum of S. Callisto, and in which were painted Constantine's
   monogram in very large letters, and, secondly, Christ sitting on a
   globe, between Peter and Paul. On the cover, in a mosaic of green
   stones, stood the inscription "Qui et filius diceris et pater
   inveniris" (Kraus, Rom. sott. 2 Aufl., p. 550). De Rossi, Kraus, and
   Schultze (Katakomben, p. 34) suppose that we have here the discovery of
   a burial place of Modalistic Monarchians, and that, as the monogram
   proves, of the fourth century. The sepulchre has again disappeared, and
   we have to depend entirely on Marangoni's account, which contains no
   facsimile. It is not probable that a Sabellian burial-place lay in
   immediate proximity to Domitilla's catacomb in the fourth century, or
   that the grave-yard of any sect was preserved. If we can come to any
   decision at all, in view of the uncertainty of the whole information,
   it seems more credible that the inscription belongs to the third
   century, and that the monogram was added to deprive it of its heretical
   character. Whether Ambrosius and Ambrosiaster refer in the following
   quotations to Roman or say Western Monarchians living in their time is
   at least questionable. (Ambrosius, de fide V. 13. 162, Ed. Bened. II.
   p. 579 "Sabelliani et Marcionit√¶ dicunt, quod h√¶c futura sit Christi ad
   deum patrem subjectio, ut in patrem filius refundatur"; Ambrosiaster in
   Ep. ad Cor. II. 2, Ed. Bened. App. II., p. 117, "quia ipsum patrem sibi
   filium appellatum dicebant, ex quibus Marcion traxit errorem"). Optatus
   (I. 9) relates that in the African provinces not only the errors, but
   even the names, of Praxeas and Sabellius had passed away; in I. 10, IV.
   5, V. 1 he discusses the Patripassians briefly, but without giving
   anything new. Nor can we infer from Hilary (de trinitate VII. 39; ad
   Constant. II. 9) that there were still Monarchians in his time in the
   West. Augustine says (Ep. 118 c. II. [12] ed. Bened. II., p. 498)
   "dissensiones qu√¶stionesque Sabellianorum silentur." Secondhand
   information regarding them is to be found in Augustine, Tract. in Joh.
   (passim) and H√¶r. 41. (The remarks here on the relation of Sabellius to
   No√´tus are interesting. Augustine cannot see why orientals count
   Sabellianism a separate heresy from Monarchianism). Again we have
   similar notices in Aug. Pr√¶dest. H. 41 -- in H. 70 Priscillians and
   Sabellians are classed together; as already in Leo I -- , in Isidor, H.
   43, Gennadius, Eccl. Dogm. I. 4 ("Pentapolitana h√¶resis")
   Pseudo-hieron. H. 26 ("Unionita" etc., etc. In the Consult. Zacch. et
   Appollon. l. II. 11 sq. (Gallandi -T. IX., p. 231 sq) -- a book written
   about 430 -- a distinction is made between the Patripassians and
   Sabellians. The former are correctly described, the latter confounded
   with the Macedonians. Vigilius Dial. adv. Arian. (Bibl. Lugd. T.

   3, X. 21; in ep. ad Titum fragm. II; in Mt. XVI. 8, XVII. 14; c. Cels.
   VIII. 12, etc. For Sabellius, Philosoph. IX. is, in spite of its
   meagreness, of fundamental importance. Hippolytus introduces him in a
   way that shows plainly he was sufficiently well known at the time in
   the Roman Church not to need any more precise characterisation (see
   Caspari, Quellen III., p. 327.). Epiphanius (H. 62) has borrowed from
   good sources. If we still possessed them, the letters of Dionysius of
   Alex. would have been our most important original authorities on S. and
   his Libyan party. But we have only fragments, partly in Athanasius (de
   sententia Dionysii), partly in later writers -- the collection in Routh
   is not complete, Reliq S. III., pp. 371-403. All that Athanasius
   imparts, though fragmentary, is indispensable (espec. in the writings
   De synod.; de decret. synod. Nic. and c. Arian. IV. This discourse has
   from its careless use led to a misrepresentation of Sabellian teaching;
   yet see Rettberg, Marcell. Pr√¶f.; Kuhn, Kath. Dogmatik II. S. 344;
   Zahn, Marcell. S. 198 f.). A few important notices in Novatian, de
   trinit. 12 sq.; Method., Conviv. VIII. 10; Arius in ep. ad. Alex.

   Opp. ed. Montfaucon II., p. 37 sq.); Joh. Damascenus; Nicephorus Call.,
   H. E. VI. 25. For Monarchianism we have a few passages in Gregorius
   Thaumaturg. The theologians after Origen and before Arius will be cited
   under.

   [218] Emendations both to support and to refute Sabellianism were
   proposed in the valued works of the past; the N. T., as well as other
   writings belonging to primitive Christian literature, being tampered
   with. Compare Lightfoot's excursus on I. Clem. II., where Cod. A reads
   tou Theou while C and S have tou Christou, the latter an emendation
   opposed to Monarchianism or Monophysitism (St. Clement of Rome,
   Appendix, p. 400 sq.). The old formulas to haima, ta pathemata tou
   Theou and others came into disrepute after the third century.
   Athanasius himself disapproved of them (c. Apoll. II. 13. 141, I., p.
   758), and in the Monophysite controversy they were thoroughly
   distrusted. Thus in Ignatius (ad. Eph. I.) en haimati Theou and (ad.
   Rom. VI.) tou pathous tou Theou mou were corrected. On the other hand
   (II. Clem. IX.) the title of pneuma for Christ was changed into logos.
   In the N. T. there are not a few passages where the various readings
   show a Monarchian or anti-Monarchian, a monophysite or dyophysite
   leaning. The most important have been discussed by Ezra Abbot in
   several essays in the "Bibliotheca Sacra" and the "Unitarian Review".
   But we can trace certain various readings due to a Christological bias
   as far back as the second century: thus especially the famous ho
   monogenes huios for monogenes Theos John I. 18; on this see Hort., Two
   Dissertations I., on MONOGENES ThEOS in Scripture and Tradition, 1878;
   Abbot in the Unitarian Review, June 1875. Since the majority of the
   important various readings in the N. T. belong to the second and third
   century, a connected examination of them would be very important from
   the standpoint of the history of dogma. For dogmatic changes in the
   western texts, the remarkable passage in Ambrosiaster on Rom. V. 14
   falls especially to be noticed.

   [219] See Dionys. Alex. in Euseb. VII. 6. Dionysius speaks as if the
   appearance of Sabellian doctrine in his time in the Pentapolis were
   something new and unheard of.

   [220] This information, however, first appears in Basil, then in
   Philaster, Theodoret, and Nicephorus; possibly, therefore, it is due to
   the fact that Sabellius' teaching met with great success in Libya and
   Pentapolis.

   [221] Athanas de sententia Dionysii 5.

   [222] This appears also from our oldest witness, the letter of
   Dionysius, Eusebius H. E. VII. 6: peri tou nun kinethentos en te

   [232] There were still Sabellians in Neo-C√¶sarea in the time of
   Basilius; Epiphanius knows of them only in Mesopotamia (H. 62 c. 1).
   The author of the Acta Archelai (c. 37) also became acquainted with
   them there; he treats them like Valentinians, Marcionites, and
   followers of Tatian as heretics.

   [236] Sabellius seems to have been held a heretic all over the West
   about A.D. 300; see the Acta Archelai, Methodius etc.

   III., pp. 373-403. The main source is Athanasius de sentent, Dionysii,
   a defence of the Bishop, due to the appeal of the Arians to him; see
   also Basilius de spiritu, p. 29; Athan. de synod. 43-45.

   [238] Euseb., H. E. VII. 26. 1: Epi tautais tou Dionusiou pherontai kai
   allai pleious epistolai, hosper hai kata Sabelliou pros Ammona tes kata
   Bereniken ekklesias episkopon, kai he pros Telesphoron kai he pros

   Dionusio prosphonei. Dionysius had already called the attention of
   Sixtus II., the predecessor of the Roman Dionysius, to the revolt in
   the Pentapolis.

   [239] Hagemann maintains that they first turned to the Alexandrian
   Bishop himself, and that he wrote an explanatory letter, which,
   however, did not satisfy them; but this cannot be proved (Athanasius de
   sentent. Dion. 13 is against it). The standpoint of the accusers
   appears from their appeal to the Roman Bishop, from the fact that he
   made their cause his own, and from the testimony of Athanasius. who
   describes them as orthodox Churchmen (de sentent. Dion. 13) -- they
   were orthodox in the Roman sense. It is entirely wrong, with Dorner
   (Entwickelungsgesch. I., p. 748 f.) and Baur (Lehre v. d. Dreieinigkeit
   I., p. 313), to identify the accusers with those heretics, who,
   according to Dionysius' letter, taught there were three Gods; for the
   heretics meant were rather the Alexandrian theologians.

   passage in the letter to Euphranor ran (c. 4): poiema kai geneton einai
   ton huion tou Theou, mete de phusei idion, alla xenon kat' ousian auton
   einai tou patros, hosper estin ho georgos pros ten ampelon kai ho

   [245] L. c. 15.

   [246] L. c. 18.

   [247] L. C. 23. The expositions of nous and logos which were found both
   in the 2 and 4 books of Dionysius quite remind us of Porphyry: kai
   estin ho men hoion pater ho nous tou logou, on eph' eautou, ho de
   kathaper huios ho logos tou nou. pro ekeinou men adunaton, all' oude
   exothen pothen, sun ekeino genomenos, blastesas de ap' autou. houtos ho
   pater ho megistos kai katholou nous proton ton nhion logon hermenea kai
   angelon heautou echei.

   [248] L. c. 17.

   [249] We see from the passages quoted by Basilius that Dionysius
   adhered to the expression "treis hupostaseis," but discarded the
   "merismenas einai." while his accusers must have attacked the former
   expression also: Ei to treis einai tas upastaseis memerismenas einai
   legousi, treis eisi, kan me thelosin e ten theian triada pantelos
   aneletosan.. This accordingly is to be translated: "if they maintain
   that a separation is necessarily involved in the expression three
   Hypostases,' yet there are three -- whether they admit it or no -- or
   they must completely destroy the divine triad."

   [250] L.c. 20, 21. It is very noteworthy, that Dionysius has not even
   brought himself to use the expression homoousios in his elenchos. If he
   had Athanasius would have given it in his extracts. For the rest, the
   attempt of Athanasius to explain away the doubtful utterances of
   Dionysius, by referring them to the human nature of Christ, is a
   makeshift born of perplexity.

   [251] De decret. synod. Nic. 26 (see besides de sentent. Dion. 13).

   [252] The attack on the latter has alone been preserved by Athanasius
   along with the concluding argument; it is thus introduced: Hoti de
   poiema oude ktisma ho tou Theou logos, all' idion tes tou patros ousias

   According to Dionysius, then, some Alexandrian teachers taught "tropon
   tina" -- this is the only limitation -- a form of Tritheism. The whole
   effort of the Bishop was to prevent this. We recognise here the old
   Roman interest in the unity of God, as represented by Victor,
   Zephyrine, and Callistus, but Dionysius may also have remembered, that
   his predecessors, Pontian and Fabian, assented to the condemnation of
   Origen. Should we not connect the angry reproach, levelled at the
   Alexandrian teachers, that they were Tritheists, with the charge made
   by Callistus against Hippolytus, that he was a Ditheist; and may we not
   perhaps conclude that Origen himself was also accused of Tritheism in
   Rome?

   [254] The positive conclusion runs: Out' oun katamerizein chre eis
   treis theotetas ten thaumasten kai theian monada, oute poiesei koluein
   to axioma kai to huperballon megethos tou kuriou; alla pepisteukenai
   eis Theon patera pantokratora kai eis Christon Iesoun ton huion autou
   kai eis to hagion pneuma, henosthai de to Theo ton holon ton logon; ego
   gar, phesi. kai ho pater hen esmen. kai ego en to patri kai ho pater en
   emoi -- these are the old Monarchian proof-texts -- houto gar an kai he
   theia trias kai to hagion kerugma tes monarchias diasozoito. We see
   that Dionysius simply places the "holy preaching of the Monarchy" and
   the "Divine Triad" side by side: "stat pro ratione voluntas." Between
   this conclusion and the commencement of the fragment preserved by
   Athanasius given in the preceding note, we have a detailed attack on
   those who hold the Son to be a poiema like other creatures, "while the
   Holy Scriptures witness to his having an appropriate birth, but not to
   his being formed and created in some way." The attack on the en hote
   ouk en touches the fundamental position of the Alexandrian scholars as
   little as the opposition to three Gods; for Dionysius contents himself
   with arguing that God would have been without understanding, if the
   Logos had not always been with him; a thing which no Alexandrian
   doubted. The subtle distinction between Logos and Logos Dionysius
   leaves wholly out of account, and the explanation of the Roman Bishop
   on Proverbs VIII. 32 (kurios ektise me archen hodon autou): ektise
   entautha akousteon anti tou epestese tois up' autou gegonosin ergois,
   gegonosi de di' autou tou huiou, must merely have caused a
   compassionate smile among the theologians of Alexandria.

   [255] See above, page 45.

   [256] See the letter to Fabius of Antioch, and the attitude of
   Dionysius in the Novatian controversy, in which he sought at first to
   act as mediator precisely as he did in the dispute over the baptism of
   heretics (Euseb. H. E. VI. 41, 42, 44-46, VII. 2-9).

   [257] See the fragments in Euseb. H. E. VII. 24, 25. The criticism of
   the Apocalypse is a master-piece.

   [258] See Euseb. H. E. VII. 26, 2; the fragments of the work in Routh,
   Reliq. S. IV., p. 393 sq. On this, Roch, die Schrift des Alex.
   Bischofs, Dionysius d. Gr. √ºber die Natur (Leipzig 1882) and my account
   of this dissertation in the Th. L. Z. 1883, No. 2. Dionysius' work,
   apart from a few Biblical quotations which do not affect the arguments,
   might have been composed by a Neo-platonic philosopher. Very
   characteristic is the opening of the first fragment preserved by
   Eusebius. Poteron en esti sunaphes to pan, hos hemin te kai tois
   sophotatois Hellenon Platoni kai Puthagora kai tois apo tes Stoas kai
   Herakleito phainetai; there we have in a line the whole company of the
   saints with whom Epicurus and the Atomists were confronted. We notice
   that from and after Justin Epicurus and his followers were extremely
   abhorred by Christian theologians, and that in this abhorrence they
   felt themselves at one with Platonists, Pythagoreans, and Stoics. But
   Dionysius was the first Christian to take over from these philosophers
   the task of a systematic refutation.

   [259] Photius Cod. 119.

   [260] Routh, Reliq. S. III., pp. 425-435.

   [261] Jerome, de vir. 76 ; see also Euseb. H. E. VII. 32.

   [262] Cod. 106.

   [263] The first book dealt with the Father and Creator; the second,
   with the necessity that God should have a son, and the Son; the third,
   took up the Holy Ghost; the fourth, angels and demons; the fifth and
   sixth, the possibility and actuality of the Son's incarnation; the
   seventh, God's creative work. From the description by Photius it
   appears that Theognostus laid the chief stress on the refutation of two
   opinions, namely, that matter was eternal, and that the incarnation of
   the Logos was an impossibility. These are, however, the two theses with
   which the Neoplatonic theologians of the 4th and 5th centuries
   confronted Christian science, and in whose assertion the whole
   difference between Neo-platonism, and the dogmatic of Alexandrian
   churchmen at bottom consisted. It is very instructive to notice that
   even at the end of the 3rd century the antithesis thus fixed came
   clearly to the front. If Theognostus, for the rest, rejected the
   opinion that God created all things from a matter equally eternal with
   himself, this did not necessarily imply his abandonment of Origen's
   principle of the eternity of matter; yet it is at any rate possible
   that in this point he took a more guarded view of the master's
   doctrine.

   [264] The fragment given by Athanasius (de decr. Nic. syn. 25) runs as
   follows: Ouk exothen tis estin epheuretheisa he tou huiou ousia, oude
   ek me onton epeisechthe; alla ek tes tou patros ousias ephu, hos tou
   photos to apaugasma, hos hudatos atmis; oute gar to apaugasma oute he
   atmis auto to hudor estin e autos ho helios, oute allotrion; kai oute
   autos estin ho pater oute allotrios alla aporrhoia tes tou patros
   ousias, ou merismon hupomeinases tes tou patros ousias; hos gar menon
   ho helios ho autos ou meioutai tais ekcheomenais hup' autou augais,
   houtos oude he ousia tou patros alloiosin hupemeinen, eikona heautes
   echousa ton huion. Notice that the merismos is here negatived; but this
   negative must have been limited by other definitions. At all events we
   may perhaps regard Theognostus as midway between Pierius and Alexander
   of Alexandria.

   [265] See Gregory of Nyssa, c. Eunom. III. in Routh, l.c., p. 412; he
   proscribes the proposition of Theognostus: ton Theon boulomenon tode to
   pan kataskeuasai, proton ton huion hoion tina kanona tes demiourgias
   proupostesasthai. Stephanus Gobarus has expressly noted it as a scandal
   that Athanasius should nevertheless have praised Theognostus (in
   Photius, Cod. 282). Jerome did not admit him into his catalogue of
   authors, and it is remarkable that Eusebius has passed him over in
   silence; this may, however, have been accidental.

   [266] See Athanas. Ep. ad Serap. IV., ch. 11; Routh, l.c., pp. 407-422,
   where the fragments of Theognostus are collected.

   [267] See Epiph. H. 67. 3, 55. 5.

   [268] Epiphanius (H. 67) speaks in the highest terms of the knowledge,
   learning, and power of memory, possessed by Hieracas.

   [269] H. understood the resurrection in a purely spiritual sense, and
   repudiated the restitutio carnis. He would have nothing to do with a
   material Paradise; and Epiphanius indicates other heresies, which H.
   tried to support by a comprehensive scriptural proof. The most
   important point is that he disputed, on the ground of 2 Tim. II. 5, the
   salvation of children who died even when baptised; "for without
   knowledge no conflict, without conflict no reward." Epiphanius
   expressly certifies his orthodoxy in the doctrine of the Trinity; in
   fact. Arius rejected his Christology along with that of Valentinus,
   Mani, and Sabellius, in his letter to Alexander of Alex. (Epiph. H. 69.
   7). From his short description of it (oud hos Hierakas luchnon apo
   luchnou, e hos lampada eis duo -- these are figures already employed by
   Tatian) we can only, however, conclude that H. declared the ousia of
   the Son to be identical with that of the Father. He may have developed
   Origen's Christology in the direction of Athanasius.

   [270] See my Art. in Herzog's R. E. 2 Aufl. VI., p. 100 f. Hieracas
   recognised the essential difference between the O. and N. T. in the
   commandments as to agneia, enkrateia, and especially, celibacy. "What
   then did the Logos bring that was new?" or what is the novelty
   proclaimed and instituted by the Only-begotten? The fear of God? The
   law already contained that. Was it as to marriage? The Scriptures (=
   the O. T.) had already dealt with it. Or as to envy, greed, and
   unrighteousness? All that is already contained in the O. T. Hen de
   monon touto katorthosai elthe, to ten enkrateian keruxai en to kosmo
   kai heauto analexasthai hagneian kai enkrateian. Aneu de toutou me
   dunasthai zen (Epiph. H. 67, ch. 1). He appealed to 1 Cor. VII., Hebr.
   XII. 14, Math. XIX. 12, XXV. 21.

   [271] Procopius undoubtedly maintains (Comm. in Genes., ch. III., p.
   76, in Routh, Reliq. S. IV., p. 50) that Dionysius Alex., in his
   commentary on Ecclesiastes, contradicted the allegorical explanation of
   Gen. II., III; but we do not know in what the contradiction consisted.

   311.

   [273] See the fragments of Peter's writings in Routh, l.c., pp. 21-82,
   especially pp. 46-50. Vide also Pitra, Analecta Sacra IV., p. 187 sq.,

   [274] Decidedly spurious is the fragment of an Mustagogia alleged of
   Peter, in which occur the words: ti de eipo Heraklan kai Demetrion tous
   makkarious episkopous, hoious peirasmous hupestesan hupo tou manentos
   Origenous, kai autou schismata ballontos en te ekklesia, ta heos

   [275] We have unfortunately no more precise information as to Peter's
   attitude; we may determine it, however, by that of Methodius (see
   under).

   L√∂sche, Ztschr. f. wiss. Theol. 1884, S. 259) maintains that
   expressions occurred in the speculations of Numenius and Porphyry as to
   the nature of God, which only emerged in the Church in consequence of
   the Nicene Council. Those technical terms of religio-philosophical
   speculation, common to the Neoplatonists of the 3rd century, the
   Gnostics and Catholic theologians, require reexamination. One result of
   this will be perhaps the conclusion that the philosophy of Plotinus and
   Porphyry was not uninfluenced by the Christian system, Gnostic and
   Origenistic, which they opposed. We await details under this head from
   Dr. Carl Schmidt.

   [277] The meaning which was afterwards attached to the received
   categories was absolutely unthinkable, and corresponded perfectly to
   none of the definitions previously hit upon by the philosophical
   schools. But this only convinced men that Christianity was a revealed
   doctrine, which was distinguished from philosophical systems by
   mysterious ideas or categories.

   [278] But we have not yet ascertained the method followed in the
   earlier period of collecting the verdicts of the older Fathers, and of
   presenting them as precedents; yet it is noteworthy that Iren√¶us and
   Clement already delighted in appealing to the presbuteroi, which meant
   for them, however, citing the Apostles' disciples, and that Paul of
   Samosata was accused in the epistle of the Synod of Antioch, of
   despising the ancient interpreters of the Divine Word (Euseb. VII. 30).

   [279] See Caspari IV., p. 10 ff.; Ryssel, Gregorius Thaumaturgus, 1880.

   [280] See Caspari's (l.c.) conclusions as to Gregory's confession of
   faith, whose genuineness seems to me made out. Origen's doctrine of the
   Trinity appears clearly in the Panegyric. The fragment printed by
   Ryssel, p. 44 f., is not by Gr. Thaumaturgus.

   [283] It remained a matter of doubt in the East up to the beginning of
   the fourth century, whether one ought to speak of three Hypostases
   (essences, natures), or one.

   p. 196 sq., ed. Paris, 1840.

   [285] Ryssel, p. 71 f., 118 f. The genuineness of the tractate is not
   so certain as its origin in the 3rd century; yet see Loofs, l.c.

   [286] See also the Sermo de incarnatione attributed to Gregory (Pitra
   III., p. 144 sq., 395 sq.)

   [287] Origen himself always possessed in his unconditional adherence to
   the Bible a kind of corrective against the danger of passing entirely
   over to philosophy. Though thoroughly versed in philosophical science,
   he sought never to be more than a scriptural theologian, and urged his
   disciples -- witness his letter to Gregor. Thaum. -- to give up their
   philosophical studies, and devote themselves wholly to the Bible. No
   professedly philosophical expositions occur in Origen himself, so far
   as I know, like those transmitted by his disciples. For the latter the
   comprehensive chapter of Eusebius (H. E. VII. 32) is very instructive.
   Here we meet with Bishops who seem to have been scholars first and
   clerics afterwards. This Eusebius (¬ß 22) has to tell of one: logon men
   philosophon kai tes alles par' Hellesi paideias para tois pollois
   thaumastheis, ouch homoios ge nen peri ten theian pistin
   diatetheimenos.

   [288] It is unknown who was the kallion hemon presbutes kai` makaristos
   aner quoted by Epiph. (H. 64, ch. 8 and 67) as an opponent of Origen.

   [289] Besides these we have Eastern theologians, who, while they did
   not write against Origen, show no signs in their works of having been
   influenced by Alexandrian theology, but rather resemble in their
   attitude Iren√¶us and Hippolytus. Here we have especially to mention the
   author of five dialogues against the Gnostics, which, under the title
   "De recta in deum fide," bear the name of Adamantius; see the editio
   princeps by Wetstein, 1673, and the version of Rufinus discovered by
   Caspari (Kirchenhistorische Anecdota, 1883; also Th. L.-Z. 1884, No. 8)
   which shows that the Greek text is interpolated. The author, for whom
   we have perhaps to look in the circle of Methodius, has at any rate
   borrowed not a little from him (and also from the work of Theophilus
   against Marcion?). See Jahn, Methodii, Opp. I., p. 99, II. Nos. 474,
   542, 733-749, 771, 777. M√∂ller in Herzog's R. E., 2 Ed., IX., p. 725.
   Zahn, Ztschr. f. Kirchengesch., Vol. IX., p. 193 ff.: "Die Dialoge des
   Adamantius mit den Gnostikern." The dialogues were written ¬± 300,
   probably somewhere in East Asia Minor, or in West Syria, according to
   Zahn about 300-313 in Hellenic Syria, or Antioch. They are skilfully
   written and instructive; a very moderate use is made of philosophical
   theology. Perhaps the Ep. ad Diogn. also came from the circle of
   Methodius. Again, there is little philosophical theology to be
   discovered in the original edition of the first six books of the
   apostolic Constitutions, which belongs to the third century. See
   Lagarde in Bunsen's Analecta Ante-Nic√¶na T. II. The author still
   occupied the standpoint of Ignatius, or the old anti-gnostic teachers.
   The dogmatic theology, in the longer recension of the work, preserved
   in Greek, belongs entirely to the reviser who lived in or after the
   middle of the 4th century (so App. Const. II. 24, VI. 11, 14, 41 [Hahn,
   Biblioth. der Symbole, 2 Aufl., ¬ß¬ß 10, 11, 64]; see my edition of the
   Didache, p. 241 ff. That Aphraates and the author of the Acta Archelai
   were unaffected by Origen's theology will have been clear from what was
   said above, p. 50 f.

   [293] He was ranked in later times with Iren√¶us and Hippolytus (see
   Andreas C√¶s. in pr√¶f. in Apoc., p. 2.) and that as a witness to the
   inspiration of John's Apocalypse.

   [294] See Jahn, l.c.

   [295] See the long fragments of the writing de resurrectione which was
   directed against Origen, as also the work peri ton geneton. Methodius
   called Origen a "Centaur" (Opp. I. 100, 101), i.e., "Sophist," and
   compared his doctrine with the Hydra (I. 86). See the violent attack on
   the new-fashioned exegetes and teachers in De resurr. 8, 9 (Opp I. 67
   sq.) and 20, (p. 74), where the osta noeta and sarkas noetas of
   Origen's school are ridiculed; ch. 21, p. 75; 39, p. 83.

   [296] See the short argument against Origen, De resurr. 28, p. 78: Ei
   gar kreitton to me einai tou einai ton kosmon, dia ti to cheiron
   hereito poiesas ton kosmon ho Theos; all' ouden ho Theos mataios e
   cheiron epoiei. oukoun eis to einai kai menein ten ktisin ho Theos
   diekosmesato. Wisdom I. 14 and Rom. VIII. 19 follow. The fight waged by
   Methodius against Origen presents itself as a continuation of that
   conducted by Iren√¶us against the Gnostics. It dealt in part with the
   same problems, and used the same arguments and proofs. The extent to
   which Origen hellenised the Christian tradition was in the end as
   little tolerated in the Church as the latitude taken by the Gnostics.
   But while Gnosticism was completely ejected in two or three generations
   it took much longer to get rid of Origenism. Therefore, still more of
   Origen's theology passed into the "revealed" system of Church doctrine,
   than of the theology of the Gnostics.

   [297] See Conviv. III. 6 (p. 18 sq.): taute gar ton anthropon
   aneilephen ho logos, hopos de di' autou kataluse ten ep' olethro

   [298] Yet see, under, the new turn given to the speculation.

   [299] S. Conviv. III. 5: eti gar pelourgoumenon ton Adam, hos estin

   me palin tois tes phthoras expsthen epiklustheis hieumasin, tekedona
   gennesas diapese. Methodius, like Iren√¶us, gave much study to Paul's
   Epistles, because they were especially quoted by Origen and his school
   (see ch. 51 fin., p. 90); on the difficulties which he felt see De
   resurr. 26, p. 77; 38, p. 83.

   [300] The expositions of concupiscence, sin, and death, are
   distinguished very strongly from those of Origen. (For death as means
   of salvation see De resurr. 23, 49). They resemble the discussions of
   Iren√¶us, only Methodius maintains -- a sign of the times -- that
   sinlessness is impossible even to the Christian. See De resurr. 22 (I.,
   p. 75): zontos gar eti tou somatos pro tou tethnexesthai suzen ananke
   kai ten hamartian, endon tas rhizas autes en hemin apokruptousan, ei
   kai exothen tomais tais apo ton sophronismon kai ton noutheteseon

   amartiais ontes heuriskometha; oudeis gar houtos hamartias ektos einai
   heauton kauchesetai, hos mede kan enthumethenai to sunolon holos ten
   adikian. To this conception corresponds the view of Methodius that
   Christianity is a cultus of mysteries, in which consecration is
   unceasingly bestowed on the teleioumenoi. Methodius also referred Rom.
   VII. 18 f. to those born again.

   [301] The allegory receives another version Opp. I., p. 119: me pos ara
   hai treis hautai ton progonon kephalai pases tes anthropotetos
   homoousioi hupostaseis kat' eikona tina, hos kai Methodio dokei -- the
   passage occurs in Anastasius Sin. ap. Mai, Script. Vet. N. Coll. IX. p.
   619 -- tupikos gegonasi tes hagias kai homoousiou triados, tou men

   [302] Conviv. III. 8.

   [303] It was not altogether absent in earlier times, and on this see
   ch. V. ¬ß 2. As we have remarked above, individualism in this extreme
   form occurs also in Origen; see, e.g., "De orat." 17.: "He who has
   perceived the beauty of the bride whom the Son of God loves as
   bridegroom, namely, the soul."

   [304] Conviv. VIII. 8: Ego gar ton arsena (Apoc. XII. 1 f.) taute
   gennan eiresthai nomizo ten ekklesian, epeide tous charakteras kai ten

   pneumatos eis Christon bebaptismenon, sumballouses entautha ten en to
   logo tranosin auton kai metamorphosin tes ekklesias. Even Tertullian
   teaches (De pud. 22) that the martyr who does what Christ did, and
   lives in Christ, is Christ.

   [305] The theology of Methodius was in the Eastern Church, like
   Tertullian's in the West, a prophecy of the future. His method of
   combining tradition and speculation was not quite attained even by the
   Cappadocians in the 4th century. Men like Cyril of Alexandria were the
   first to resemble him. In Methodius we have already the final stage of
   Greek theology.

   [306] See Funk, Patr. App. Opp. II. pp. 1-27, and Harnack,
   Sitzungsberichte d. Preuss. Akad. d. Wissensch. 1891, p. 361 ff.

   [307] On the authority of Methodius in later times, see the Testimonia
   Veterum in Jahn, 1. c. I., p. 6 sq. The defence of Origen against
   Methodius by Pamphilus and Eusebius has unfortunately been preserved
   only to a very small extent. See Routh, Reliq. S. IV., p. 339 sq.

   [308] It is instructive to notice how Athanasius has silently and
   calmly shelved those doctrines of Origen which did not harmonise with
   the wording of the rule of faith, or allegorised facts whose artificial
   interpretation had ceased to be tolerated.

   [309] See above, p. 75.

   [310] It is possible, and indeed probable, that Creeds were then set up
   for the first time in many Churches. The history of the rise of Creeds
   -- further than the Baptismal formula -- in the East is wholly obscure.
   Of course there always were detailed Christological formulas, but the
   question is whether they were inserted into the Baptismal formula.

   [311] It has been already pointed out on p. 48, note 1, that the
   Biblical character of some of those additions cannot be used against
   their being regarded as theological and philosophical formulas. The
   theology of Origen -- witness his letter to Gregory -- was throughout
   exegetical and speculative; therefore the reception of certain Biblical
   predicates of Christ into the Creeds meant a desire to legitimise the
   speculation which clung to them as Apostolic. The Churches, however, by
   setting up theological Creeds only repeated a development in which they
   had been anticipated about 120 years before by the "Gnostics." The
   latter had theologically worked out Creeds as early as in the second
   century. Tertullian, it is true, says of the Valentinians (adv. Valent.
   I.) "communem fidem affirmant," i.e., they adapt themselves to the
   common faith; but he himself relates (De carne, 20; see Iren. I. 7, 2)
   that they preferred "dia Marias" to "ek Marias"; in other words, of
   these two prepositions, which were still used without question even in
   Justin's time, they, on theological grounds, admitted only the one. So
   also they said "Resurrection from the dead" instead of "of the body."
   Iren√¶us as well as Tertullian has spoken of the "blasphemous" regul√¶ of
   the Gnostics and Marcionites which were always being changed (Iren. I.
   21 5, III. 11 3, I. 31 3; II pr√¶f.; II. 19 8, III. 16, I. 5; Tertull.,
   De pr√¶scr. 42; Adv. Valent. 4; Adv. Marc. I. 1, IV. 5, IV. 17). We can
   still partly reconstruct these "Rules" from the Philosoph. and the
   Syntagma of Hippolytus (see esp. the regula of Apelles in Epiphan. H.
   XLIV. 2). They have mutatis mutandis the most striking similarity to
   the oriental confessions of faith published since the end of the third
   century; compare, e.g., the Creed, given under, of Gregorius
   Thaumaturgus with the Gnostic rules of faith which Hippolytus had
   before him in the Philosoph. There is, further, a striking affinity
   between them in the fact that the ancient Gnostics already appealed in
   support of their regul√¶ to secret tradition, be it of one of the
   Apostles or all, yet without renouncing the attestation of these rules
   by Holy Scripture through the spiritual (pneumatic) method of Exegesis.
   Precisely the same thing took place in the Eastern Churches of the next
   age. For the tenor and phrasing of the new Creeds which seemed to be
   necessary, the appeal to Holy Scripture was even here insufficient, and
   it was necessary to resort to special revelations, as in the case
   alluded to, p. 115, note 3, or to a paradosis agraphos of the Church.
   That the new theology and Christology had found their way into the
   psalms sung in the Church, can be seen from the Synodal document on
   Paul of Samosata (Euseb. VII. 30, 11), where it is said of the Bishop:
   psalmous tous men eis ton kurion hemon I. Chr. pausas hos de neoterous
   kai neoteron andron sungrammata; i.e., Paul set aside those Church
   songs which contained the philosophical or Alexandrian christology. In
   this respect also the Church followed the Gnostics: compare in the
   period immediately following, the songs of Arius, on the one hand, and
   the orthodox hymns on the other; for we know of Marcionite,
   Valentinian, and Bardesanian psalms and hymns. (See the close of the
   Muratorian Fragment, further my investigations in the Ztschr. f.
   wissensch. Theol., 1876, p. 109 ff.; Tertull., De Carne Chr. 17;
   Hippol., Philos. VI. 37; the psalms of Bardesanes in Ephraim; the
   Gnostic hymns in the Acts of John and Thomas, in the Pistis Sophi√¶,
   etc.). It is self-evident that these psalms contained the
   characteristic theology of the Gnostics; this also appears from the
   fragments that have been preserved, and is very clearly confirmed by
   Tertullian, who says of Alexander the Valentinian (1. c.): "sed remisso
   Alexandro cum suis syllogismis, etiam cum Psalmis Valentini, quos magna
   impudentia, quasi idonei alicuius auctoris interserit." The scholastic
   form of the Church was more and more complete in the East in the second
   half of the third century Alexandrian Catechists, had finally succeeded
   in partly insinuating its teaching into the Church. Where Valentine
   Basilides, etc., had absolutely failed, and Bardesanes partly
   succeeded, the School of Origen had been almost entirely successful. It
   is very characteristic that the ecclesiastical parties which opposed
   each other in the third century applied the term "school"
   (didaskaleion) as an opprobrious epithet to their antagonists. This
   term was meant to signify a communion which rested on a merely human,
   instead of a revealed doctrine. But the Church nearly approximated, in
   respect of doctrine, to the form of the philosophic schools, at the
   moment when her powerful organisation destroyed every analogy with
   them, and when the possession of the two Testaments marked her off
   definitely from them. Much might be said on "schola" and "ecclesia"; a
   good beginning has been made by Lange, Haus und Halle, 1885, p. 288 ff.
   See also v. Wilamowitz-M√∂llendorff, "Die rechtliche Stellung der
   Philosophenschulen," 1881.

   [312] See also the document in Eusebius, H. E. VIII. 30, 6, where it is
   said of Paul: apostas tou kanonos epi kibdela kai notha didagmata
   meteleluthen.

   [313] Caspari, l. c. IV., p. 10. 27. Hahn, ¬ß 114.

   [314] It runs: Heis Theos, pater logou zontos, sophias huphestoses kai
   dunameos kai charakteros aidiou, teleios teleiou gennetor, pater huiou
   monogenous, Heis kurios, monos ek monou, Theos ek Theou, charakter kai

   ouch huparchon, husteron de epeiselthon; oute gar enelipe pote huios
   patri oute huio pneuma, all' atreptos kai analloiotos he aute trias
   aei. It ought to be distinctly noticed that the genuineness of this
   Creed is, in spite of Caspari's brilliant defence, not raised above all
   doubt. But the external and internal evidence in support of its
   authenticity seem to me overwhelming. According to Gregory of Nyssa it
   was said to have been revealed to Gregory Thaumaturgus immediately
   before entering on his Bishopric, by the Virgin Mary and the Apostle
   John. If this legend is old, and there is nothing to show it is not,
   then we may regard it as proving that this confession of faith could
   only be introduced into the Church by the use of extraordinary means.
   The abstract, unbiblical character of the Creed is noteworthy; it is
   admirably suited to a follower of Origen like Gregory; but it is less
   suited to a post-Nicene Bishop. Origen himself would hardly have
   approved of so unbiblical a Creed. It points to a time in which there
   was imminent danger of theological speculation relaxing its connection
   with the Books of Revelation.

   [315] See Theodoret, H. E. I. 4; Hahn, l. c., ¬ß 65: Pisteuomen, hos te

   [316] The C√¶sarean Creed in Athanasius, Socrates, Theodoret and
   Gelasius, see. Hahn, ¬ß 116 and Hort, Two Dissertations, pp. 138, 139.
   It runs: Pisteuomen eis hena Theon patera pantokratora, ton ton

   theological character. On the Creeds of Antioch and Jerusalem, which
   are at any rate earlier then A.D. 325. see Hort, (l.c 73) and Hahn,
   ¬ß 63. We cannot appeal, as regards the phrasing, to the so-called Creed
   of Lucian (Hahn, ¬ß 115). Yet it is extremely probable that it is based
   on a Creed by Lucian.

   [317] See the interesting passage in Eusebius' letter to his Church, in
   which he (sophistically) so defends the rejection of the ouk en pro tou
   gennethenai, as to fall back upon the universally recognised
   pre-existence of Christ (Theodoret, H. E. I. 12).

BOOK I.

THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOGMA AS THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOD-MAN ON THE
BASIS OF NATURAL THEOLOGY.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

  HISTORICAL SITUATION. [318]

   The first main division of the history of dogma closed with the
   adoption of the Logos doctrine as the central dogma of the Church, and
   with the accompanying revision in the East of the old formulas of the
   faith under the influence of philosophical theology. The testament of
   primitive Christianity -- the Holy Scriptures -- and the testament of
   Antiquity -- Neoplatonic speculation -- were intimately and, as it
   seemed, inseparably connected in the great Churches of the East. The
   system of doctrine established by the Church in the third century
   corresponded to the Church whose structure appeared complete in the
   same period. As the political powers of the Roman Empire were conserved
   in the Catholic Church, so also were the spiritual forces of Antiquity
   in its faith. Both required to be invested with divine lustre in order
   to live through storms and amid universal ruin. [319] But Christianity
   was by no means completely Hellenised in Catholicism; that is proved,
   if we needed proof, by the attacks of Porphyry and Julian. Undoubtedly
   all the institutions and ideas felt to be necessary were included in
   the "Apostolic tradition" to an increasing extent. But since a place
   had been given in that tradition to the O. T. and the written memorials
   of primitive Christianity, these really furnished aids to the
   comprehension of the Gospel, which had certainly been obscured in the
   "Gnosis" as well as in the "New Law". The theology of Origen, in spite
   of some very earnest attacks upon it, was held in the East to be the
   pattern and the inexhaustible source of the theology of the Church, so
   far as a scientific system was desired. Even its opponents, like
   Methodius, could not escape its influence. From its rich store of
   formulas were more fully elaborated, in opposition to what was called
   Ebionitism and Sabellianism, those confessions which were employed in
   the cultus and instruction of the Church, and which, thus enriched,
   were then invested with some sort of Apostolic authority. [320] The
   West did not go. so far; yet it was perfectly defenceless against the
   "advances" made by the Church in the Eastern half of the Empire; for
   certain theological and Christological conceptions to which it also
   clung, made any counter-movement impossible, though many teachers,
   preachers, and apologists went ways of their own, and in their
   doctrines of Christ and salvation mixed up obsolete Christian
   traditions with the popular philosophy of the West. Looking to
   theological metaphysics as wrapped up in the official formulas of the
   Church, the difference was finally only one of degree. It showed itself
   among those less interested and scholarly, who were therefore
   conservative in their instincts and looked with distrust on the
   theology of Origen; they thought with perfect simplicity that their own
   formulas: "Father, Son, and Spirit; one God", "Christ, the Logos,
   wisdom, and power of God", "du√¶ substanti√¶, una persona", "Jesus
   Christ, God and man", constituted the "faith" which needed no
   explanation. The element of speculative philosophy was as a rule weak
   in the system of religion of the West. In place of it, the West of
   Tertullian possessed a series of juristic "plans" which were destined
   to have a great future.

   In spite of many far-reaching differences in their practical and
   theoretical interests, in spite of the development in ecclesiastical
   affairs, Christians in East and West felt that they belonged to one
   united Church. The Novatian and Samosatian controversies ultimately
   resulted in strengthening the consciousness of unity, [321] even though
   a not altogether insignificant part of Christendom cast itself adrift.
   These controversies showed plainly that the Western and Eastern
   communities held substantially the same position in the world, and that
   both required to use the same means to maintain it. Communities
   everywhere adopted the character of the Church of the world. Their
   union preserved all the features of a political society, and, at the
   same time, of a disciplinary institution, equipped with sacred
   sanctions and dreadful punishments, in which individual independence
   was lost. [322] Of course, in proportion as this confederacy of
   Christians adapted itself to civic, national, and political
   relationships, in order to maintain and strengthen itself, the
   integrity of the Church was most gravely imperilled, when these very
   relationships lost their last shreds of unity in the collapse of the
   Empire. Above all, the great cleavage between the Eastern and Western
   halves of the Empire could not fail to be prejudicial to the Church.
   But about the close of the third century the latter, in spite of
   discontent in its midst, held more firmly together than the Empire, and
   its unity was still maintained after the fourth century by great
   Emperors and influential theologians. [323]

   In addition to the episcopal constitution, uniformly and strictly
   carried out, the common basis of the Churches was due to the
   recognition of the same authorities and designs, the uniform
   appreciation of sacramental rites, and the strong tendency to
   asceticism for the sake of a future life. It was, at first, too stable
   for the different forces which threatened to shatter the Empire, and
   also, in consequence, beat upon the Imperial Church. But this basis was
   nevertheless insufficient. It can be easily shown that the elements
   composing it were as incapable of guaranteeing the unity, as of
   protecting the Christianity, of the Church, through a prolonged period.

   Among the authorities the two Testaments, combined by the evidence of
   prophecy and allegorical explanation, took the first, indeed, strictly
   speaking, a unique place. But not only was their extent not absolutely
   decided, but their interpretation was wholly uncertain. In addition to
   this, the scope to be left to the "Apostolic tradition", i.e., the
   illusion of "antiquity", and to the decision of episcopal synods, was
   by no means defined; for the sufficiency of Holy Scripture was placed,
   theoretically, beyond doubt. But where elementary wants, felt by the
   great majority, were to be satisfied, where a reassuring sanction was
   required for the advancing secularisation, men did not rack their
   brains, if no inconvenient monitors were in the way, to find precedents
   in Holy Scripture for what was novel. They went right back to the
   Apostles, and deduced from secret traditions what no tradition ever
   possessed. Huge spheres of ecclesiastical activity embracing new and
   extensive institutions -- the reception of national customs and of the
   practices of heathen sects -- were in this way placed under "Apostolic"
   sanction, without any controversy starting worth mention. This is true,
   e.g., of the ritual of worship and ecclesiastical discipline, "The
   sacred canons" or "the apostolic canons" constituted from the close of
   the third century, a court of appeal, which practically held the same
   rank as the sacred writings, and which, especially in the East, cast
   its protection to an increasing extent over national customs and
   traditional morals in the face of attacks of every kind. It is obvious
   that authorities so obtained were likely, in the end, to divide the
   Churches of the different nations.

   The crudest superstition was thus consecrated by "apostolic" decrees,
   or legitimised, after the event, from the O. T., [324] and from the
   middle of the third century it ascended from the lower strata of
   Christians to the upper, which had lost all spiritual stability. And
   now in the fourth century, when Church and State were fused into one,
   everything was assigned to the former which had ever, or anywhere been
   regarded as venerable or holy. As it had submitted to the Church, it
   demanded indulgent treatment. The religion of pure reason and of the
   strictest morality, the Christianity which the ancient apologists had
   once portrayed, had long changed into a religion of the most powerful
   rites, of mysterious means, and an external sanctity. The historical
   tradition of Christ and the founding of Christianity was turned into a
   romance, and this historical romance, which was interwoven with the
   religion, constantly received new chapters. The stream of the history
   of salvation ended in a waste swamp of countless and confused sacred
   tales, and in its course took in heathen fictions and the stories of
   gods and heroes. Every traditional holy rite became the centre of new
   sacred ceremonies, and every falling off in morality was covered by
   increasing the religious apparatus. The idea of forgiveness of sins was
   to many a cloak for frivolity and wickedness. Up to the middle of the
   third century, every Catholic Christian was, in all probability, a
   genuine monotheist. That can no longer be said of the generations who
   afterwards pressed into the Church. Polytheism had lost its name,
   indeed, but not its influence in the Church of the fourth century.
   Great masses preserved, in spite of their baptism, the piety to which
   they had been accustomed. Christian priests had to respect and adjust
   superstition, in order to keep the leadership in their hands, and
   theologians had no difficulty in finding, in the O. T. and in many
   views and usages of Christian antiquity, means of justifying what was
   most novel, alien, and absurd. Miracles were of everyday occurrence,
   and they were barbarous and detestable miracles, directed to meet the
   meanest instincts, and offensive to even moderately clear heads. [325]
   The Christian religion threatened to become a new paganism; [326]
   while, at the same time, making shipwreck of its own unity and common
   character. For even if priests and theologians were always to be in a
   position to keep the reins in their hands, dissolution threatened the
   one undivided Church which girt the Empire, if the local rites,
   customs, usages of men were consecrated as Christian in every province,
   and might establish themselves without any decided counterpoise.

   But where was such a counterpoise to be found? In the constitution?
   That was indeed a firm structure, binding Christendom strongly
   together; but even it presented sides on which the centrifugal forces,
   destructive of unity, found entrance. Love of rule and ambition were
   encouraged by the episcopal chair. And when the danger of dismemberment
   into independent bishoprics was met by a rigid metropolitan leadership,
   the way was opened up to that lofty ambition which desired the first
   place and the highest influence in the province, and which sought to
   domineer over the civil powers and to master neighbouring provinces.
   The Patriarchs and Metropolitans who -- to use an expression of
   Socrates -- played at being "hereditary lords" (Dynastai) no longer
   protected, but undermined the unity of the Church. The great Bishops of
   Rome and Alexandria, who sought to rule over the Church in order to
   preserve its unity and independence, entangled themselves in an
   ambitious policy, and produced division. The Emperors were really
   patrons of unity, and the supreme means at their disposal, the
   OEcumenical Synod, was their contrivance; in all cases it was a
   political institution, invented by the greatest of politicians, a
   two-edged sword which protected the endangered unity of the Church at
   the price of its independence.

   But was not the bond of unity, the common ground, to be found in the
   common ideal, in the certain hope of a future life, and in asceticism?
   This bond was assuredly a strong one. The Church would hardly have
   succeeded in following out the free path opened up to it by Constantine
   had it not had in its midst, besides its transcendent promises, a power
   to which all, Greek and barbarian, polytheist and monotheist, learned
   and unlearned required ultimately, if reluctantly, to bow. And that
   power was the asceticism which culminated in monachism. The ancient
   world had arrived, by all the routes of its complicated development, at
   the bitterest criticism of and disgust at its own existence; but in no
   other faith was religion itself as effectively combined with
   asceticism, in none did the latter come so powerfully to the front, yet
   in none did it submit itself so pliably to Church government, as in
   Catholicism. A religion comprehended in a mere sacramental communion
   could not have gained the allegiance of the more clear-sighted and
   earnest. One that imposed on all, as an inalienable duty, the perfect
   fulfilment of the positive moral law, could not have held its ground.
   One that commanded all alike to renounce the world would have closed
   the world against it. But a religion which graded its members as
   priests, monks, and laity, embraced a threefold piety of initiated,
   perfect, and novices, and succeeded in the hardest task of all, that of
   reconciling priest with monk, [327] and of admitting the layman to a
   share in the blessings of both, was superior to all others, and
   possessed in its organisation, generally established, a strong bond of
   association.

   Protestants at the present day can hardly form a conception of the hold
   which asceticism possessed over the mind in the fourth and fifth
   centuries, or of the manner in which it influenced imagination,
   thought, and the whole of life. At bottom only a single point was dealt
   with, abstinence from sexual relationships; everything else was
   secondary; for he who had renounced these, found nothing hard.
   Renunciation of the servile yoke of sin (servile peccati iugum
   discutere) was the watchword of Christians, and an extraordinary
   unanimity prevailed as to the meaning of this watchword, whether we
   turn to the Coptic porter or the learned Greek teacher, to the Bishop
   of Hippo, or Jerome, the Roman presbyter, or the biographer of Saint
   Martin. Virginity was the specifically Christian virtue, and the
   essence of all virtues: in this conviction the meaning of the
   evangelical law was summed up. [328] But not only did the evangelical
   law culminate in virginity, but to it also belonged all promises.
   Methodius' teaching that it prepared the soul to be the bride of
   Christ, was from the fourth century repeated by everyone. Virginity
   lies at the root of the figure of bridegoom (Christ) and bride (the
   soul) which is constantly recurring in the greatest teachers of East
   and West, and it is the key to the corresponding exposition of the Song
   of Songs, in which often appear a surprising religious individualism
   and an impassioned love of Christ. [329]

   But the ascetic ideal did not succeed in establishing itself,
   especially in the West, without severe conflicts, and it concealed
   within it dangers to the Church. Asceticism threatened to become an end
   in itself, and to depart from the historical foundation of the
   Christian religion. When the Church authorised the Christianity of the
   perfect', it really declared the great mass of its divine and apostolic
   institutions to be mere apparatus, meaningless to him who had resolved
   to renounce the world, and to prepare for eternity. Those settlers in
   Egypt, who sought to obtain redemption by torturing themselves, in the
   end imperilled religion not less than the great crowds who simply
   submitted to certain sacramental observances, and with the approval of
   the priests dragged into Christianity whatever pleased them. It was
   possible, and in fact the danger was imminent, for the ascetic ideal to
   lose any assured connection with Jesus Christ. Asceticism had also been
   proclaimed indeed by Greek science. But in that case the common
   character of religion disappeared; for a merely negative ideal of life,
   which at the same time was without a close dependence on history, could
   not form a lasting bond of connection among men.

   Our information is exceptionally bad, and not from accident, as to the
   internal state of the Church, at the time when Constantine chose it to
   be the support of the Empire. But what we know is enough to establish
   the fact that the internal solidity by no means corresponded to the
   external. We may with greater propriety affirm that the Churches of the
   East were in danger of relapsing into worldliness, and that not only in
   the form of worldly modes of action. [330] The peril went deeper.
   Theology, the power which, as matters then were, could alone give an
   energetic protection to the distinctive character of religion, was at
   the point of dissolving it and abandoning it to the world.

   We have already described in this volume the state of Eastern theology
   at the beginning of the fourth century. Conceptions of the faith which
   began and ended with the historical personality of Jesus Christ were
   equally condemned with the attempts, whether unstudied or
   philosophical, to identify the Person of Jesus with the Deity. [331]
   The realistic and eclectic theology of Irena√¶us had probably very few
   defenders in the West. The theology of the Apologists had triumphed,
   and all thinkers stood under the influence of Origen. But the genius of
   this great man was too powerful for the Epigoni. The importance of his
   system lay in a threefold direction: first, in the sharp distinction
   between Pistis and Gnosis, which he kept apart, and connected only by
   unity of aim; secondly, in the abundant material in his speculations,
   the conservatism that he showed in inweaving all that was valuable, and
   the balance which he knew how to preserve between the different factors
   of his system, relating them all to one' uniform aim; thirdly, in the
   Biblical impress which he gave his theology by strict adherence to the
   text of Holy Scripture. In all these respects the Epigoni introduced
   changes. The most important in its consequences was the mingling of
   Pistis and Gnosis, of faith and theology. Origen had not published his
   system, in which the faith of the Church was reconciled with science,
   as Church doctrine. To him the distinction between the faith of the
   Church and the science of faith remained fixed. But in the next period
   -- following the precedent of Methodius [332] and opposing Basil's
   principle  --   it was thought necessary to identify them. Reactionary
   and progressive tendencies met in these efforts. The Pistis (faith) was
   supplied with the formulas of Origen's theology, and Gnosis was to stop
   short at certain tenets of tradition, and to receive them without
   revision. The point was to find a new medium which should be at once
   tradition and speculation, Pistis and Gnosis. This endeavour was
   undoubtedly justified by an actual change accomplished before this and
   promoted by Origen himself, viz., the incorporation of the doctrine of
   the Logos in the faith of "the simple." These simple Christians already
   possessed a dogma which was shaped by exegesis and speculation, and
   confronted them as an external authority, a law of faith. This creation
   had forced its way from the circumference of the ecclesiastical system
   into its centre. Besides, the sharp distinction between a traditional
   doctrine of the Church and a science of religion contradicted the whole
   ecclesiastical tradition as established in the fight with Gnosticism.
   But the intermingling at first produced a kind of stagnation. It
   threat. ened to make faith lose its certainty, speculation its
   reasoning power, and the Church the unity of its confession. If we
   review the new religious formulas, which were brought into circulation
   about the year 300, and if we compare the theologies of the period --
   which unfortunately we only know in part -- the theologies, namely, of
   the Alexandrian teachers, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Lucian, Methodius,
   Hieracas etc., we see a wealth of forms which, if blood-relations, are
   extremely different. How could the unity of the Church continue under
   their sway? and if it continued, was it Christianity after all that
   furnished the common element?

   And this has brought us to the second point Origen had recognised the
   full significance of the historical Christ for the stage of Pistis;
   while he directed the Gnostic to the eternal Logos. Now uncertainties
   arose here also. The historical Christ threatened to fall entirely into
   the background. We can observe this in the works of two of the Epigoni,
   which have no affinity to each other. Gregory Thaumaturgus has in his
   famous Symbol dealt only with the Logos "apart from the flesh" (logos
   asarkos), [333] and Methodius intended to declare the loftiest truth
   when he demanded that Christ should be born in every man consciously'
   (noetos), and that each must become a Christ by participation in
   Christ. [334] Further, in Origen the cosmological and soteriological
   interests balanced each other. We recognise this in his formulas which
   relate to the Logos. But here also a displacement was introduced, one
   that favoured cosmology. The word Homoousios (consubstantial) was,
   indeed, retained by some, perhaps by many theologians; but as it was in
   itself ambiguous, so also it was no evidence of an interest in
   soteriology. The crowd of rhetorical and philosophical predicates
   heaped upon the Logos, did not serve to illustrate and establish the
   significance of the Logos as the principal factor in redemption; it was
   rather a term for the reason and order reigning in the universe, and
   for the spiritual forces with which humanity had been gifted. Men
   indeed held firmly, on all hands, to the incarnation; nay, it was
   regarded, as is proved by the great work of Theognostus, as being, next
   to the doctrine of the creation of matter, the feature that
   distinguished the speculation of the Church from that of the
   Neo-platonists. But the whole stress was laid on the question, what
   idea was to be formed of the constitution of the subject of which
   incarnation was predicated. A great school, that of Lucian of Antioch,
   distinguished, in the manner of Paul of Samosata, between wisdom
   proper, eternal, existent in God, and a created wisdom or Logos; and
   identified the latter alone with the incarnate Son -- wisdom arose
   through wisdom according to the will of the wise God'. But in drawing
   this line, not only was the incarnation of the Deity rendered
   impossible, but every form of His personal activity on earth. The
   theological interest in Christ threatened to resolve itself entirely
   into cosmology and morality, or, as in Methodius, to be deprived of its
   meaning by a mystical alloy.

   The liberty which theology enjoyed in the East up to the beginning of
   the fourth century, and the influence which it exerted on the Church in
   the same period, could not but produce complete confusion and loss of
   meaning. All the elements united by Origen in his vast system sought to
   establish them. selves independently. Even tritheistic tendencies were
   not wanting; but, above all, the idea of a subordinate God and
   semidivine beings began to be familiar. The idea of the subordinate God
   is indeed as old as the theology of the Christian Church; even the
   Apologists shared it, and Origen, with all caution, adopted and
   justified it in working out his doctrine of the Son. But in the earlier
   period the simplices et rudes (the simple and uncultured) were still
   startled at the suggestion; theologians provided the idea with strong
   safe-guards, and Origen himself, who in many points bordered on
   Polytheism, on the other hand restored the Logos to the being of God,
   and united Father and Son as closely as possible. But opposition to
   Sabellianism' evidently rendered a later age much more careless. And it
   is indubitable that the idea of the created God, the God who came into
   being, coalesced with ancient polytheistic inclinations. The claims of
   Monotheism were considered to be satisfied by the effort to protect the
   supreme Deity, as against Modalism,. from change and plurality; and the
   Logos and other beings entitled to worship were suffered calmly to
   spring up side by side with God; they could not, it was presumed,
   endanger Monotheism, because they belonged to the domain of the
   created. Add that theologians dealt in their speculations with a
   plethora of philosophical categories destitute of a fixed impress, or
   fixed value; [335] further, that this terminology, unsifted and
   uncontrolled, everywhere forced its way into the faith of the
   community, and we can form a conception of the danger which hovered
   over the Church. We find a Monotheism which did not exclude polytheism,
   a Logos-Christ, who, as a cosmological quantity, was of shifting nature
   and origin, ideas of the incarnation and redemption as designed to
   "enlighten" the human race, and to effect an incarnation of God in
   every individual soul. All this, too, was clothed in a rank growth of
   artificial philosophical expressions, identical with that used in
   contemporary science. And we may well ask whether such a theology was
   in a condition to protect even the scanty remains of the evangelic
   tradition, above all, at the moment when the partition between State
   and Church was torn down and the Church was brought face to face with
   its greatest task. A deism -- if the term may be allowed -- was at
   hand, surrounded by the shifting forms of a speculation which had
   neither a settled boundary nor an assured object. It almost seemed as
   if the special characteristics of the Christian religion were to be
   reduced to the evidence of antiquity and prophecy, what Porphyry called
   foreign fables'. Yet even Scriptural proof was no longer everywhere
   called for and given with the zeal so noticeable in Origen; although it
   was just the school of Lucian which neglected it least. But what could
   Scripture avail against the method? If a Bishop so capable and learned,
   and so well versed in tradition as Eusebius of Caesarea was satisfied
   in his Christology with the formulas we read there, if he could praise
   the religious edicts and manifestoes of his Emperor, though they
   substantially celebrated "God in nature", as brilliant specimens of his
   Christian conviction, we must conclude that the Logos doctrine settled
   in the Church was the strongest means of completely effacing the figure
   of the historical Christ, and of resolving everything into mist. [336]
   Even the rationalist, who in his study of the history of religions
   always follows with sympathy the progress to natural' religion, would
   require to restrain his sympathy here. For the pure religion of
   humanity could not have resulted from this development, but one that
   was wholly indefinite, and therefore capable of being influenced from
   any quarter, one in whose centre was throned that hollow and helpless
   figment of thought, the on, the prote ousia (being-primal being). And
   men would have gone on proclaiming this religion to be Christianity,
   simply because they possessed in Holy Scripture the means of proving
   it, and of dating it back to the beginning of the world as the
   universal religion. And they would have adopted sacred media, charms,
   and intermediary powers more and more boldly, because they were
   incapable of understanding and applying either to God or to Jesus
   Christ the tradition that God redeemed men through Jesus Christ.

   The Bishops and theologians in the East about A.D. 320, whose views
   were similar to those of Eusebius, had on their side the strongest
   power to be found in an ecclesiastical communion -- tradition: they
   were the conservatives. Conservative theology, the theology that took
   its stand on Origen, limited the idea of Deity to the primal being
   (prote ousia), inoperative and really incapable of being revealed,
   i.e., to the Father. It accordingly ignored the Logos and Christ in
   determining the conception of God. Further, it deduced, like the
   Neoplatonists, a second or third Ousia (being) from the first, and
   adorned the Logos created by the will of the Father with the loftiest,
   yet vacillating, predicates. It taught the incarnation of the Logos,
   and celebrated its result, yet once more in indefinite, in
   high-sounding and meaningless, Biblical phrases. Finally, it
   subordinated everything spiritual and moral to the thought of free-will
   and human independence. Any attempt at precision could not fail, on
   this domain, to be regarded as an innovation. Anything might establish
   itself as long as it did not claim to be exclusive. [337] There never
   did exist in the Church a general tendency to form new dogmas -- the
   terms new' and dogma' are mutually exclusive; least of all did it exist
   in the East; there was either indifference to philosophical
   speculation, or a desire that it should have liberty, or it was
   regarded with suspicion. For the rest, men reverenced in the cultus the
   mystery, i.e., the complex of formulas whose origin had already become
   obscure. [338]

   Nevertheless, there probably never was a time in the East when a
   reaction did not exist against the development of the Logos doctrine
   towards complete separation of the Son from the Father. [339] It sprang
   not only from Modalists, but also from disciples of Origen, and it
   celebrated at Nic√¶a an amazingly rapid triumph. In opposition to a
   school which had ventured too far forward, and had embroidered the
   doctrines of Paul of Samosata with questionable tenets of Origen, the
   term Homoousios, once banned at Antioch, was successfully elevated to
   the dignity of the watchword of faith.

   The importance of this rapid triumph for the history of dogma cannot be
   rated too highly. But procured as it was by the Emperor, the victory
   would have been resultless, had it not been for the man whose biography
   coincides with the history of dogma of the fourth century --
   Athanasius.

   The second division of the history of dogma, the account of its
   development, opens with Athanasius, but his conception of the faith
   also dominated following centuries. Augustine alone surpassed him in
   importance; for Augustine was an Origen and Athanasius in one  --   and
   he was still more. [340] However, the future course of history has yet
   to decide whether Athanasius' thought will not in the end live longer
   than the conceptions of Augustine. At the present day at least
   Augustine is given up sooner than Athanasius in the Churches.

   But it is really not permissible to compare these great men. Augustine
   was a loftier genius, a man of inexhaustible wealth of ideas and
   sentiment; Athanasius' greatness consisted in reduction, in the energy
   with which, from a multitude of divergent speculations claiming to rest
   on tradition, he gave exclusive validity to those in which the strength
   of religion then lay. Augustine opened up a new view of the highest
   blessings and of human nature in the Church, he scattered a thousand
   germs for the future; Athanasius, like every reformer, reduced, he
   first secured a sphere of its own to the Christian religion on the
   soil, already won, of Greek speculation, and he referred everything to
   the thought of redemption. Augustine invented a new speculation, and
   the fascinating language of the deepest religious feeling, beyond which
   changed times and manners seem unable to go; Athanasius was unable to
   put forward either gifts of speculation or of eloquence on behalf of
   the thought in which he lived. His strength arose out of his conviction
   and his office.

   Athanasius was a reformer, though not in the highest sense of the word.
   Behind and beside him existed a speculation which led on a shoreless
   sea, and the ship was in danger of losing its helm. [341] He grasped
   the rudder. We may compare the situation with that in which Luther
   found himself when confronting the medi√¶val Church and Scholasticism.
   It was not for a word, or a formula, [342] that he was concerned, but a
   crucial thought of his faith, the redemption and raising of humanity to
   divine life through the God-man. It was only from the certainty that
   the divinity manifest in Jesus Christ possessed the nature of the Deity
   (unity of being) and was for this reason alone in a position to raise
   us to divine life, that faith was to receive its strength, life its
   law, and theology its direction. But Athanasius in thus giving the
   chief place to faith in the God-man who alone delivers from death and
   sin, furnished practical piety, then almost exclusively to be found in
   monkish asceticism, with its loftiest motive. To speak briefly, this
   combined as closely as possible the Homoousios (consubstantial), which
   guaranteed the deification of human nature, with monkish asceticism,
   and raised the latter from its still under-ground or, at least,
   insecure realm to the public life of the Church. While fighting against
   the phrase the created Logos (logos-ktisma) as heathen and as a denial
   of the power of the Christian religion, he at the same time as
   strenuously opposed worldly pursuits. He subordinated Scripture,
   tradition, and theology to the thought that the Redeemer was God by
   nature, but he also strove to work out the Christian life which
   received its motive from close communion with the God-Christ, [343] and
   the prospect of being invested both the divine nature. If we would do
   justice to Athanasius, both these facts must be kept in mind. He became
   the father of Catholic orthodoxy and the patron of ecclesiastical
   monachism, and that he never would have been, had he not also set the
   practical ideal of the piety of the time on the candlestick'. [344]

   There is here nothing new in the common sense of the word; Athanasius
   had really on his side, the best part of the tradition of the Church,
   to which he also appealed. Iren√¶us had already given the central place
   to the object, nature, and accomplishment of redemption in the
   categories: Logos, incarnation, Godman, deification, and sons of God.
   Athanasius could refer to a series of ideas in Origen and other
   Alexandrian catechists in support of his distinctive treatment of the
   Logos doctrine. New alone was the fact, the energy and exclusiveness of
   his view and action at a time when everything threatened to undergo
   dissolution.

   Athanasius was no scientific theologian in the strict sense of the
   term; from theology he descended to piety, and found the exact word
   required. A man of authority, and attached to the tradition of his
   school, he was not in a position to disentangle the problem from the
   context in which the Apologists and Origen had set it. He was a
   disciple of Origen, but his attitude first to Marcellus, and then to
   the recent defenders of Homoou'sios, the Cappadocians, proves that he
   was as destitute of scientific interest in a philosophical theory of
   life, as of the obstinacy of theologians. He had to deal with that
   which transcended theology. He was the first to raise to honour in the
   Church in all its force the old maxim that we must think of Christ as
   God (hos peri theou), and therefore he paved the way for the new
   principle, that we must think of God as in Christ (hos en Christo).

   In this he stood aloof from the rational thought of his time. While
   admitting its premises, he added an element, which neutral speculation
   was incapable of assimilating completely. Nothing certainly was more
   unintelligible to it, than the assumption of an essential unity of the
   quiescent and the active Deity. Athanasius fixed a gulf between the
   Logos of the philosophers, and the Logos whose redeeming work he
   proclaimed. What he said of the latter, declaring the mystery strongly
   and simply, and by no means committing himself to new distinctions,
   could not but appear to the Greeks an offence and folly'. But he did
   not shrink from reproach; with firm hand, though in awkward lines, he
   marked off a sphere of its own for the Christian faith. [345]

   And this man respected science and its free development. We can observe
   this in his criticisms of Origen and the Alexandrian catechists.
   Undoubtedly it must have been important to him to obtain reliable
   witnesses (testes veritatis) for his doctrine, and the effort to do
   this explains frequently his practice of making the best of everything.
   But it does not entirely explain his conduct. Christian faith was in
   his view exhausted in faith in the God-man, the incarnation, and the
   redemption which constituted a divine nature; for this reason he
   permitted liberty in everything else. It would seem that he had no
   desire to abolish Origen's distinction between the Christian science of
   the perfect and the faith of the imperfect. He did not sit as a judge
   of heretics on Origen's doubtful tenets and correct them by the regula
   fidei, nor did he follow the course first taken by Bishop Peter, one of
   his predecessors, in Alexandria. [346] This is all the more remarkable,
   as for his own part he could hardly find a single point in the Gnostic
   heterodoxies of Origen with which he could agree.

   Athanasius did not see beyond the horizon of his own time. He
   attributed the highest efficacy to the mysteries of the cultus. He
   regarded them as the personal legacy of Christ, immediate emanations of
   his life as God-man, and as containing the means of applying salvation.
   If in succeeding centuries the religious interest attached itself more
   and more closely to ritual, that did not imply any contradiction of the
   conception of the great Alexandrian. He also laboured on behalf of the
   dogma which was to obtain its practical and effective presentation in
   the monks on the one hand, and in ritual on the other, until the
   transitory was exalted into the permanent.

   Athanasius' importance to posterity consisted in this, that he defined
   Christian faith exclusively as faith in redemption through the God-man
   who was identical in nature with God, and that thereby he restored to
   it fixed boundaries and specific contents. [347] Eastern Christendom
   has been able to add nothing up to the present day. Even in theory it
   has hit on no change, merely overloading the idea of Athanasius; but
   the Western Church also preserved this faith as fundamental. Following
   on the theology of the Apologists and Origen, it was the efficient
   means of preventing the complete Hellenising and secularisation of
   Christianity.

   The history of dogma in the East after the Nicene Council reveals two
   interlacing lines of development. First, the idea of the God-man from
   the point of view of the redemption and elevation of the human race to
   divine life, in other words, the faith of Athanasius, was elaborated on
   all sides. In this the history of dogma, in the strict sense of the
   term, exhausted itself, for dogma was faith in the God-man. But with
   this a second development was closely connected, one which dealt with
   the relations of dogma and theology. Here also one man can be named: it
   was the science that Origen had cultivated which formed the centre of
   interest. However, since his days the problem had become more
   complicated, for theological principles that penetrated deeply had been
   received into faith itself, and the great development up to the Council
   of Chalcedon, and still later, consisted in the incorporation of
   theological results and formulas in the general belief of the Church.
   The question, accordingly, was not merely whether a freer and more
   independent theology, like Origen's in spirit and method, could receive
   an acknowledged position and latitude in the Church; whether, in
   general, the phases of criticism and idealistic spiritualism, included
   in Origen's science, were to be tolerated. It was a much harder problem
   that arose, though one that from its nature was always half concealed.
   If the theological dogma, at the moment when it became a creed of the
   Church, received the value of an apostolic doctrine which had never
   been wanting in the Church, how were the theologians to be regarded who
   had really created it, and how were the most venerated men of the past
   to be looked upon who had either been wholly ignorant of the dogma, or
   had incidentally, or avowedly, contradicted it? The conclusion is
   clear. The former were to receive special honour as witnesses to, but
   not as creators of, the truth. The latter it was necessary to abandon,
   however real and constructive their labours may once have been, or
   their works were to be coloured, corrected, or even amended by the
   insertion of glosses. But how long will a theology receive room to work
   on dogma, if the work is again and again to be disguised and how long
   will theologians be found to continue the dangerous business? "Theology
   is the most thankless of sciences. It crushes its builders with the
   very stones which they have helped to erect." The relation of theology
   to dogma recalls the myth of Chronos. But here it is not the father who
   swallows his children, it is the creature that devours its creators up
   to the third and fourth generations. As, moreover, the age from the
   fourth to the sixth centuries is the classic period of all dogma, so in
   no other period does it so clearly exhibit to the historian its
   characteristic of demanding living sacrifices.

   Accordingly we observe two phenomena in these centuries. First, we have
   a continuous fight against the free theology of Origen, against the
   heterodoxies which it embraced, its critical phase, and its idealistic
   speculation. At any rate, more than two centuries elapsed before it was
   finally refused all right of citizenship in the Church, and at the same
   time Hellenike paideia Greek culture) was deprived of any greater
   influence on dogma, than what the latter required for its correct
   exposition and justification. [348] But, in the second place, a
   traditionalism arose which looked distrustfully on theology taking any
   share in the work of the Church at the time, which substituted
   authority for science, while it either exalted ancient teachers to
   heaven as saints, or hurled them down to hell as heretics. It was due
   to the secret logic of events that such a tendency gained strength and
   finally triumphed; for if even the most capable and independent
   theologians were compelled to live under the delusion that what was new
   in their teaching could never be true, or that the true could not
   possibly be new, it necessarily followed that fewer and fewer would be
   found to undertake their dangerous work. [349] Accordingly, after dogma
   had developed to a certain extent, held a certain number of conceptions
   capable of employing the intelligence, and was adapted to scholastic
   treatment, it became so sensitive that it ceased to tolerate a theology
   that would carry it further, even under all possible safe-guards. The
   theology that did independent work, that at no time professed to
   produce dogma, and therefore really had not existed, now came actually
   to an end. The date coincides with that at which Origen was condemned
   (the sixth century). The history of this process ran its course very
   gradually. On the other hand, there was no want of important actions in
   the history of the ejection of Origen's doctrine. We have here to
   mention the Origenist controversies', though we must not limit them, as
   has been customary, to a few decades. Along with them the opposition to
   the school of Antioch and its condemnation come before us. But we must
   not look at the victory of the creed of the Church over theological
   liberties merely from the point of view of a decline of science in the
   Church. We have rather to consider what a more liberal speculative and
   critical science had to offer at the time to the Church. In view of the
   way in which the pursuit of theology and the exposition of the faith
   were intertwined, there were gifts which the Church had to decline in
   order to maintain its tradition, i.e., the standard left to it of its
   Christianity. But the heterodoxies of the theologians presented neither
   an incentive to nor the means for a revision of the whole doctrine in
   its possession. Besides, the entire process of expelling the freer
   theology was carried out without crises worth mentioning, as if
   spontaneously. That is the strongest evidence of the weakness of the
   speculations and critical views which sought to hold their ground
   alongside the doctrine of the Church. The condition of affairs at the
   close, when we have (1) dogma (2) a theology of scholastic mysticism,
   and (3) antiquarian and formal science not confused with religion, was
   in many respects an improvement, and the value of the product received
   its strongest attestation in the duration of the system. Leaving out of
   account a few oscillations, that had been actually attained, which the
   conservatives', i.e., the great majority in all phases of violent
   dogmatic conflicts, had longed for, and had therefore always
   contemplated. A mysterious dogma had been arrived at, one elevated
   above the schools, which gave theologians liberty to be antiquarians,
   philologists, or philosophers; for what independent work was left in
   the pursuit of dogma was subject to the jurisdiction of these
   specialists, so far as it did not come under the review of the experts
   in mysteries and liturgies. But the great loss consisted in the fact
   that men no longer possessed a theological system complete in itself.
   Origen's was the only one that the Greek Church had produced. After its
   rejection there existed, besides dogma, a vast sum of incongruous
   fragments, bound artificially together by quotations from Scripture and
   tradition and from Aristotelian scholasticism. The great dogmatic work
   of John of Damascus only appears to be a logically connected system; it
   is in reality far from that.

   As regards the periods, the dividing lines are formed by the
   OEcumenical Synods, namely, the so-called 2nd, then the 4th, 5th, 6th
   and 7th. But we can also use the names of Theodosius I., Pope Leo I.,
   Justinian, and Pope Agatho. The unification of the Churches was
   rendered possible by the fact that they obtained a forum publicum (a
   public tribunal) in the universal Synods. [350] For the Creeds of the
   provincial Churches, which agreed only in the main points, and not even
   in all these, the Councils substituted a dogmatic confession whose
   proclamation, enactment, and extension excited the most violent
   conflicts. At the same time the confederation of the Churches became a
   reality through the imperial policy, which sought to come into touch
   with the strongest dogmatic currents, though not infrequently it
   supported trivialities. The last traces of independence possessed by
   individual communities were destroyed; along with unity, uniformity in
   doctrine, discipline, and worship was almost re-established, and the
   constitution of the Church, even in the higher ranks, was gradually so
   adapted to that of the empire that the hierarchical organisation and
   administration of the Church corresponded to the order of the State.
   But this re-arrangement required, in part, to be carried out by force
   (turannis of the Emperors and a few great Bishops), and speaking
   strictly, was a reality for only a few decades. It excited
   counter-movements; in opposition to it nationalistic feeling first
   really gained strength, especially in the East, and the great schisms
   of the national Churches there were also a consequence of the
   absolutist attempts at unification. [351] In the West the State
   collapsed under the storms of the tribal migration at the moment when,
   in the. East, the dismemberment of the imperial Church into national
   Churches began. The attempts of the East Roman emperors to recover the
   Western half of the realm, or at least parts of it, more than once
   thwarted the oriental policy imperatively required of them, and are
   also, from the complications to which they led, of great importance for
   the history of dogma. While the Emperors of Byzantium were involved in
   a double task, which constituted an insoluble dilemma, the Roman
   Bishops served themselves heirs to the West Roman kingdom. In the
   revolution in political and social affairs, Christians and Latins were
   compelled to postpone their separate interests and to attach themselves
   closely to the most powerful defender of the old institutions. The
   Germans, who apparently broke up the Empire, brought about the internal
   unity of all that was Catholic and Latin, and strengthened the position
   of ecclesiastical Rome. The East, on the contrary, which had been less
   endangered actually did break up. In the Western Catholic Church the
   ancient Roman Empire was preserved after a fashion with its order and
   culture. This Church had no longer beside it a state similar in
   character and closely related to itself and thus its Bishop could train
   the new peoples to his service, and soon undertook an independent
   policy against the Western schemes of the East Roman Emperors. The
   internal separation between East and West was complete, when neither
   understood the language of the other. Yet the West still took an active
   interest in the controversy of the Three Chapters', and at the same
   time obtained, in the translation of the Antiochene and Persian
   Instituta regularia divin√¶ legis, and in the great works translated at
   the instigation of Cassiodorus, valuable gifts from the East which
   stand comparison with those made by Hilary, Ambrose, Rufinus, and
   Jerome. Even in the seventh century Rome and the East were for a time
   engaged in a lively correspondence. But the rule of Byzantium over Rome
   was felt to be that of the foreigner, and conversely the Roman spirit
   was alien to the Orientals. Their relations were forced. Augustine
   hardly left a trace in the Eastern Church. That was its greatest
   calamity. Of course it was less disposed by its past to understand him
   than the Western Church, and it was at no time really inclined to
   accept instruction from its rival.

   The first period of the History of Dogma closes with the Synods of
   Constantinople (381-383). At them faith in the complete divinity of the
   Redeemer was finally settled as the creed of the Catholic Church, and
   his complete humanity was also expressly acknowledged. Next to
   Athanasius the chief part in the decision was taken by the Cappadocians
   on the one hand, and by the Roman Bishop and Ambrose on the other. It
   would not have been arrived at, however, so early, if it had not been
   carried through in Constantinople by a powerful ruler who came from the
   West. The theologians, so far as any took part in it, were men who were
   equipped with the full culture of the period, and were also devoted to
   the ideals of monastic piety. The Cappadocians were still relatively
   independent theologians, worthy disciples and admirers of Origen, using
   new forms to make the faith of Athanasius intelligible to contemporary
   thought, and thus establishing them, though with modifications, on a
   secure basis. Beside them stood Apollinaris of Laodicea, a man who
   anticipated the problems of the future, who was their equal in
   scholarship, and surpassed them in many respects in theology. But
   Arianism revealed its weakness by nothing more than its rapid decline
   after it ceased to possess the imperial favour. The impression made by
   it on the German nations, and its. prolonged popularity with them, must
   be described as an accident' in history. Catholicism was first made a
   reality by Theodosius I. -- the idea of a communion which should unite
   East and West in the same confession, beyond which no other form of
   confession was recognised.' But Ranke remarks rightly [352] that the
   Christian idea (of Nicene orthodoxy) gained the upper hand over
   Hellenistic and heretical systems, not from the doctrine alone, but
   from the course of events. The victory of the Nicene Council was also
   decided at the Tigris by the defeat of Julian, and at Adrianople by the
   death of Valens. In this first period the Christian Church was still in
   constant touch with Hellenism, and adopted from it whatever it could
   use. But the history of dogma can only give a very meagre view of these
   relations. Its boundaries gradually become altogether more restricted.
   In the first three centuries it can hardly be separated from the
   universal history of the Church; in those following the general life of
   the Church is less and less clearly reflected in it. He who desires to
   become acquainted with that life, must study the monachism, worship,
   ethics, and especially the theological science of the age. There is
   nothing in the history of dogma to require us to portray a figure like
   that of Synesius, and, if we define our task strictly, we can make
   little use of the rich epistolary literature of the time.

   The second period extends to the Council of Chalcedon (451). Its first
   and longer half covers the time in which the imperial Church, resting
   on the Nicene basis and directed by emperor, priest, and monk,
   established itself. But after a time of comparative peace, [353] the
   question again emerged as to the relation of the divine and human in
   the person of the Redeemer. The opposition between the school of
   Antioch and the new Alexandrian theology, which felt itself to be the
   sole teaching of the Church, culminated in this question, and the
   Alexandrian Bishop succeeded in making it the centre of ecclesiastical
   interest. The theologians of the school of Antioch still wrought in
   freedom; nay, even among their opponents there were to be found men who
   defined the faith by its aim, and were not overawed by traditionalism.
   Yet traditionalism grew more and more powerful. Under the leadership of
   Epiphanius the great reaction against Origen began, [354] and not only
   the Alexandrian Bishop, but the greatest scholar of the age took part
   in it. [355] To this was added another fact. The constitution of the
   Patriarchate began to reveal its effect in threatening the unity of the
   Church. The Cappadocian Churches of Asia Minor receded into the
   background simply because they possessed no patriarch of their own,
   dogmatics began to constitute an instrument of provincial
   ecclesiastical policy, and the dogmatic formula to be a mark of the
   diocese and nationality. In proportion as this took place, the state
   was compelled to intervene. Dogmatic questions became vital to it, and
   the appointment in the capital to the Patriarchate, which it had
   fostered, was now a political problem of the first rank; for the
   occupant of the chair stood at the head of the spiritual affairs of the
   empire. The great controversy was not settled at the two Synods of
   Ephesus (431, 449), but it was, ostensibly, at the Synod of Chalcedon
   (451) by means of a long formula. This formula was proposed and
   dictated by the West in the person of Bishop Leo and was approved by
   the Emperor; it was regarded in the West as the simple and unchanged
   creed of the Fathers, in the East as a compromise which was felt by
   some not to be sufficiently orthodox, and by others to require
   interpretation. Meanwhile the East hardly possessed as yet the
   rudiments of a theology capable of interpreting it. Therefore the
   formula of Chalcedon has not unjustifiably been called a national
   misfortune' for the Byzantine Empire. But even as regards the Church
   its advantages no more than balanced its disadvantages. During this
   period the monks obtained the mastery over the Church. Although their
   relations with the hierarchy were not infrequently strained, they added
   very greatly to its strength. The clergy would have been completely
   eclipsed in the world and the state, if they had not obtained a new
   support from the religiosi' and religiosity'. But while monachism
   became an important element in the Church, the prestige of the state
   declined in the minds of men; nothing was left to the Emperors but to
   adopt certain monkish fashions for themselves, and along with the state
   the life of social morality was depreciated in favour of religiosity'
   and a magical cultus. For monachism merely promotes itself and next to
   that a religion of idol-worship; it quits the field where a vigorous
   morality arises. On the other hand, however, the State was delivered at
   the close of this period from its most powerful opponent, the Bishop of
   Alexandria, though at much too high a cost.

   The third period extends up to the fifth OEcumenical Council
   (Constantinople A.D. 553). The disadvantages of the Chalcedonian
   formula made themselves felt in the first half of this century. Great
   ecclesiastical provinces were in revolt, and threatened to secede from
   the membership of the universal Church. Greek piety everywhere showed
   itself to have been unsettled by the decree of Chalcedon. Theology
   could not follow it; nay, it appeared to be stifled by the decision,
   while in Monophysitism life and movement prevailed. The perplexed
   Emperors were at their wits' end, and tried provisionally to recall, or
   at any rate to tone down, the formula, but in doing so they prejudiced
   the union with the West. This was changed under Justin I., but above
   all under Justinian I. As the reign of the latter was signalised
   politically by the restoration of the Byzantine supremacy, and the
   codification of its laws, it was ecclesiastically distinguished by the
   restoration and establishment of the constitution and dogmatics of the
   Church. The creed of Rome was recognised so far as its wording was
   concerned, but Rome itself was humbled; the Chalcedonian formula
   remained in force, but it was interpreted in terms of Cyril's teaching,
   and its future position was assured by the condemnation of the writings
   of the Antiochene schools on the one hand, and of Origen on the other.
   Thus was the theology of the past judged: solitudinem faciunt, pacem
   appellant'. The Justinian Church condemned the glorious Fathers, and
   the fifth OEcumenical Council blotted out the freer theological
   science. However, this measure was only possible because an orthodox
   Church theology had developed in the first half of the sixth century.
   [356] It presupposed the Chalcedonian formula, which had become more
   venerable by age, and explained it by means of the philosophy of
   Aristotle, which had then come once more to the front, in order to
   reconcile it with the spirit of Cyril's theology, and to make it in
   some measure comprehensible. Here we have the rise of ecclesiastical
   scholasticism which now took its place beside the mystical Neo-platonic
   theology that had been most comprehensively stated by the
   Pseudo-areopagite, and which corrected and defined it, uniting with and
   balancing it. The effect of this development was extremely significant.
   Men now began for the first time to feel themselves at home on the
   ground of the Chalcedonian formula; piety also was reconciled to it.
   Productive dogmatic work ceased entirely; its place was taken by the
   mystical theology of scholasticism based on the inheritance from
   antiquity and the enumeration of authorities. Justinian in reality
   closed not only the school of Athens, but also that of Origen, the
   schools, i.e., of productive theological science and criticism. [357]
   Henceforth theology only existed as a servant to the tradition of
   Justinian and Chalcedon. It was served in turn by the dialectic of
   Aristotle on the one hand, and the Neo-platonic mysticism of the
   Areopagite on the other. It did important work in the way of
   elaboration and adaptation; we are not warranted in passing a sweeping
   verdict of stultification and sleep; [358] but it made no further
   change in the creed of the Church and was bound hand and foot. [359]

   As regards the history of dogma the fourth period possesses no real
   independence. The dogmatic activity which characterised it was
   exclusively political; but since it created a new formula, we may here
   assume a special period. It ends with the sixth OEcumenical Council
   (A.D. 680). Justinian's policy of conquest was in the highest degree
   unstable, and went far beyond the resources of the Empire'. Whether his
   dogmatic policy was correct, which maintained union with the West at
   the cost of losing a large section of the Oriental Churches, is a
   question which may be debated. But whether an open and consistently
   monophysite policy was then still possible in Constantinople is very
   doubtful. Egypt, Syria, and Armenia were lost, not only to the state,
   but also to Greek language and culture. In order to keep them, or win
   them back from the Persians and Arabians, an energetic Emperor resolved
   to publish a monophysite rallying cry without prejudicing the wording
   of the Chalcedonian Creed. Monothelitism on the basis of the doctrine
   of the two natures is in itself no artificial creation; it is founded
   on the old consideration rising out of the doctrine of redemption; but
   at that time it had its origin in policy. Yet this still-born child of
   politics set the Eastern Church in an uproar for more than two
   generations. To prevent the loss not only of the East but of Italy
   also, the Emperor required the help of the Roman Bishop. Justinian's
   success in curbing the latter's authority had only continued for a
   little under his successors. The pontificate of Gregory I. still
   exerted an influence, and, at the sixth Council, Agatho, repairing the
   fault of one of his predecessors, dictated the formula, as Leo had done
   at Chalcedon. This bore the impress of the West, and did not correspond
   perfectly to the eastern conception. It further became manifest at the
   Council that, when it was a question of defining dogma, theology had
   been completely transformed into a rehearsal of authorities. Next to
   the older synodal decisions, the decisive precedent was formed by the
   immense, and frequently forged, collection of the dicta patrum.

   After the sixth Council, orthodoxy and Monophysitism were definitively
   separated, though attempts were not wanting to harmonise them in the
   following centuries, in keeping with the monophysite tendencies, never
   wholly destroyed, of eastern orthodoxy. The mystery was firmly
   established, and obtained further definition; for the doctrine taught
   by John of Damascus of the enhypostasis of the human nature in the
   Logos) had been accepted, even in the age of Justinian, to be the
   correct interpretation of the doctrine of the two natures. The movement
   of thought in the Church passed accordingly to a new sphere; or, more
   correctly, the old absorbing interest of the Church in the mysteries of
   the cultus [360] now came to light undisguised, because the pursuit of
   theology, converted as it was into scholasticism, had become the
   business of scholars and experts in the mysteries, and it was only
   temporarily that a controversy springing out of it agitated the Church.
   Dogma, designed by the Nicene and Chalcedonian Creeds to be looked at
   and treated formally, henceforth revealed this its character
   thoroughly. The philosophy appropriate to it was found, or invented --
   that compound of Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism, with which no one
   could dispense who desired to unfold or comment on dogma orthodoxly.
   [361] He who passed over the philosophy of the Church stood in danger
   of becoming a heretic. [362] But dogmatics, undoubtedly the foundation,
   did not dominate the Church as a living power. The conception of the
   natures of Christ found its continuation in that of the sacraments and
   sacramental things by which men became participators in Christ. The
   perceived (aistheton) thereby obtained side by side with the conceived
   (noeton) an ever loftier, and independent significance. Symbolism was
   more and more expunged; the mystery became more and more sensuous. But,
   in proportion as the latter was made operative in the cultus, the
   cultus itself was regarded, in all its setting and performance, in the
   light of the divino-human. [363] All its sensuous side, which was
   presented for his benefit to the worshipper, was regarded as deified
   and as promoting deification. Now in so far as the believer derived his
   life entirely from this cultus, a ritual system, to which the character
   of the divino-human attached, took the place of the God-man, Christ.
   Piety threatened to be submerged in a contemplation of wonders, the
   spiritual in the sensuous, and theology, in so far as not identified
   with scholasticism and polemics, in a science of mysteries. [364] From
   this point of view we can understand the worship of images and the
   reaction of iconoclasm which opened the fifth period. But this
   explanation is not complete; another factor co√∂perated. This was the
   relation of Church and State which was also involved in the controversy
   about images. There always were discords between them; but these became
   more and more acute when the priesthood fell completely under the sway
   of the monks. Even from the fifth century the practice had begun of
   transferring monks to episcopal chairs, and it had almost become the
   rule in the following centuries. But the monks both strove zealously to
   make the Church independent and claimed sovereignty among the people,
   and as a rule, though interested on behalf of the nations, they also
   cherished a strong hostility to the State: in other words they
   endangered the settlement of Church and State established in the fifth
   and sixth centuries. Their most powerful instrument was the sensuous
   cultus which had captivated the people, but which undoubtedly,
   barbarous and mechanical as it was with all its appliances and amulets,
   was yet connected with the ideal forces still to be credited to the
   age, with science, art, and especially piety. Here we have the
   miserable dilemma of the period, and of the Church; the worship of
   images was barbarous, but iconoclasm threatened to introduce an
   increased degree of barbarism. For the enlightened' (Aufkl√§rung) were
   at the disposal of an iron military despotism, and despised science,
   art, and religion.

   The Church of Byzantium was at that time engaged in a life and death
   struggle. Its existence was really at stake, and with it the existence
   of the old form of society and culture, in opposition to forces which
   as yet had no positive policy, but at first merely ruled by brute
   force. The priestly caste was arrayed against the military, the hosts
   of shaven monks against the standing army, which from the fourth
   century had played a great r√¥le, but now sought to be master in the
   state. These fearful fights ended in the restoration of the status quo
   ante, in so far as dogma and cultus were concerned, and the old order
   seemed all the more sacred after the attacks that had been made upon
   it. But on the political side, the state supported by the army carried
   off the victory -- and this was not without consequences for the system
   and life of the Church. The monks were given a free hand in dogma, but
   their activity as ecclesiastical politicians was checked. The Emperor
   remained chief priest, in spite of some patriarchs who, until after the
   eleventh century, attempted to maintain an independent and equal
   position side by side with him. With the support of his army he
   resisted them. The independence of the Church was gone, in so far as it
   sought to rise above the level of an institution devoted to ritual and
   worship. Its activity was completely restricted to the mysteries and
   the preparation for death. It became an institution of the state,
   impressing it only by the unchangeableness of its doctrine and
   ceremonies. To the new peoples to whom this Church came, the Slavs, it
   was far more than to the Greeks an unchangeable, heavenly creation. A
   thousand years have passed away since the Slavs were hellenised; and
   they have not yet ventured, like the Germans, to think and feel freely
   and at their ease in the Church, although they recognise in it a main
   defence of their national characteristics against the West. From the
   West these Greek Slavs' were spiritually separated, after Augustine's
   ideas were admitted there. The external cleavage, though only complete
   in the eleventh century, began immediately after the image controversy.
   The states in the territory of the Greek Church still really stand
   under a military dictatorship: where this has fallen, as in the kingdom
   of Greece, a final stage has not yet been reached. States like the
   former support an ecclesiastical department, but no Church.

   The path into which Athanasius led the Church has not been abandoned;
   but the other forces of life completely restricted it. Orthodox dogma
   corresponds on the whole to the conception of Athanasius; but the
   balance which he held between the religious creed and the cultus has
   been disturbed to the disadvantage of the former. The creed still shows
   life when it is called in question, or when the nation it serves
   requires a flag. In other cases it lives in the science of scholastic
   mysticism, which has already become by degrees stereotyped and sacred,
   and in its presentation in public worship. Theology also is bound to
   the latter; it has thus received a standard of which Athanasius knew
   nothing. [365]

   Our sources are the works of the Church Fathers and the Acts of
   Councils (Mansi). We still want a history of Greek ecclesiastical
   literature after Eusebius, capable of satisfying the most reasonable
   demands. Of more recent works on the subject that of Fessler is the
   best (Instit. Patrologi√¶, 1850-52), Alzog's is the most familiar, and
   Nirschl's the newest.

   [325] Compare the criticism by Julian and his friends of the Christian
   religion and the worship paid to saints and relics, or read the
   writings in which Sulpicius Severus attempts to recommend Christianity
   to the refined society of Aquitania. We can study in the works of the
   historians Socrates and Sozomen the attitude of cultured Catholic
   Christians, after the complete triumph of the Church over paganism.
   Even Sozomen cannot be regarded as having reached the stage of the "dry
   tree," and yet into what a superstition the Christian faith is
   transformed in his pages! We see how paganism thrust itself into
   worship, in -- to quote a well-known instance -- August. Confess. VI. 2
   ff. Let us, above all, remember that from the beginning of the fourth
   century special chapels and churches were built to the different
   saints. The saints took the place of the local deities; their festivals
   of the old provincial services of the gods. We have just begun to
   investigate the transformation of heathen tales of gods and heroes into
   legends of the saints, and ancient light literature has contributed its
   quota in works of travel and adventure by land and sea. These
   researches promise, if instituted critically and soberly, to give
   interesting results; yet I doubt if the state of our materials will
   admit of confident conclusions. Besides the worship of the saints, the
   cultus of the Emperor threatened in the fourth century to intrude
   itself into the Church. Philostorgius relates (H. E. II. 17) that
   Christians presented offerings to the picture of Constantine, and
   honoured it with lanterns and incense; they also seem to have offered
   vota to him that they might be protected from calamities.

   [326] Besides the worship of saints, martyrs, and relics, we have to
   notice the new forms of faith in demons. It would be impossible to
   believe more sincerely in demons than Christians did in the second
   century. But that age was yet ignorant of the fantastic tricks with
   them, which almost turned Christendom into a society of deceived
   deceivers. (The expression was first applied to Christians by Plotinus:
   see Vita Plot. by Porphyrius 16: exepaton kai autoi epatemenoi). When
   we reflect that the Vita Antonii was written by an Athanasius, nothing
   can again surprise us. Spiritualism with all its absurdity, which we
   are once more conversant with in the nineteenth century, had long been
   familiar in heathen circles, and then, as now, it was connected with
   religious ideas on the one hand, and physical experiments and
   speculations on the other. It forced its way into the Church, in spite
   of all protests, from the third, still more, however, from the fourth
   century, after it had long been wide-spread in "Gnostic circles." As a
   religious phenomenon it signified a renaissance of the lowest forms of
   religion. But even the most enlightened minds could not keep clear of
   it. Augustine proves this.

   [327] The order of the monks had to pass through crises and conflicts
   before it was able to establish itself side by side with, and to
   influence a secularised priesthood; we possess the key to this struggle
   in the East in the writings of the forger who composed the Apostolic
   constitutions and the longer recension of the Ignatian Epistles; in the
   West in the works, written from the opposite standpoint, of Sulpicius,
   as also in those of Jerome, Augustine, and the Gallican authors of the
   fifth century. Compare Hauck, K.-Gesch. Deutschlands, I., p. 49 ff. The
   order of the monks was imported into the West. It was not till about
   the middle of the fifth century that its opponents, inside and outside
   the ranks of the clergy, were silenced. For a time -- at the end of the
   fourth century -- it was in danger of being included in the
   condemnation of the Ascetics who held dualistic views.

   [328] The Fathers of the fourth century could not proceed so
   consistently as Hieracas (see Vol. III., p. 98, n. 5) since they had to
   sanction the "lower" morality in the Church. The Eustathians who
   condemned marriage -- see the decrees of the Synod of Gangra in Hefele,
   Concil. Gesch., I. 2, p. 777 ff. -- were therefore opposed. But the
   numerous tractates "De virginitate" show how near the great Fathers of
   the Church came to the Eustathian view. We can hardly point to one who
   did not write on the subject. And the same thing is, above all, proved
   by Jerome's polemic against Jovinian, in spite of its limitation, in
   the Ep. (48) ad Pammachium. For the rest, Augustine did not differ from
   Jerome. His Confessions are pervaded by the thought that he alone can
   enjoy peace with God who renounces all sexual intercourse. Like
   Hieracas, Ambrose celebrated virginity as the real novelty in Christian
   morality; see De virginibus, I. 3 sq.: "Since the Lord wrapped himself
   in a bodily form, and consummated the marriage of deity with humanity,
   without the shadow of a stain, he has infused poor frail men with
   heavenly life over the whole globe. That is the race which the angels
   symbolised when they came to serve the Lord in the wilderness . . .
   That is the heavenly host which on that holy Christmas the exulting
   choirs of angels promised to the earth. We have the testimony of
   antiquity therefore from the beginning of time, but complete submission
   only since the word became flesh. This virtue is, in fact, our
   exclusive possession. The heathens had it not; it is not practised by
   the still uncivilised barbarians; there are no other living creatures
   among whom it is to be found. We breathe the same air as they do, we
   share in all the conditions of an earthly life, we are not
   distinguished from them in birth, and so we only escape from the
   miseries of a nature otherwise similar to theirs through the virgin
   chastity, which, apparently extolled by the heathens, is yet, even if
   placed under the patronage of religion, outraged by them, which is
   persecuted by the barbarians, and is known to no other creatures."
   Compare with this Chrysostom's tractate on the state of virginity. Much
   thought was given after the middle of the fourth century to the
   relation of priest and monk, especially by those who wished to be monks
   and had to be priests. The virgin state (of the monks) was held by the
   earnest to be the easier and safer, the priestly condition the more
   perilous and responsible; yet in many respects it was regarded as also
   loftier, because the priest consummated the holy sacrifice and had to
   wield authority (Chrysostom de sacerdotio, esp. VI. 6-8 and III. 4-6,
   VI. 4). But the danger to which priests and bishops were subject of
   becoming worldly, was felt, not only by men like Gregory of Nasianzus
   and Chrysostom, but by countless earnest-minded Christians. A
   combination of the priestly (episcopal) office and professional
   asceticism was therefore early attempted and carried out.

   [329] See Vols. II., p. 294, III., p. 109. The allegory of the soul of
   the Gnostic as the bride received its first lofty treatment in the
   Valentinian school. Thence Origen got it. The sources drawn upon by
   later writers were Origen's homilies and commentary on the Song of
   Songs (Lommatzsch. XIV., p. 233 sq.): the prologue of the latter in
   Rufinus begins with the words: "Epithalamium libellus hic, id est,
   nuptiale carmen, dramatis in modum mihi videtur a Salomone conscriptus,
   quem cecinit instar nubentis spons√¶, et erga sponsum suum, qui est
   sermo dei, coelesti amore flagrantis. Adamavit enim eum, sive anima,
   qu√¶ ad imaginem eius facta est, sive ecclesia." Jerome, who has
   translated the book, says that Origen surpassed himself in it.
   Methodius' writing "Convivium" in which the same thought often occurs,
   was also much read. The purest and most attractive form of the
   conception in the East appears in Gregory of Nyssa; see e.g., his
   homilies on the Song of Songs, and his description of the life of
   Macrina (Ed. Oehler, 1858, p. 172 sq.); we read p. 210 sq.: Dia touto
   moi dokei ton theion ekeinon kai katharon erota tou aoratou numphiou.
   hon enkekrummenon eichen en tois tes psuches aporretois trephomenon,
   endelon poiein tote tois parousi kai demosieuein ten en kardia
   diathesin, to epeigesthai pros ton pothoumenon, hos an dia tachous sun
   auto genoito ton desmon eklutheisa tou somatos. Besides Gregory we have
   to mention Macarius with his "Spiritual Homilies" (Migne T. XXXIV.; see
   Floss, Macarii Aegypt. epp. etc., 1850, German translation by Jocham,
   Kempten, 1878); compare especially the 15th homily which contains
   already the figure, repeated a hundred times afterwards, of the soul as
   the poor maiden who possesses nothing but her own body and whom the
   heavenly bridegroom loves. If she worthily cherishes chastity and love
   for him, then she becomes mistress of all the treasures of her Lord,
   and her transfigured body itself shares in his divinity. Further, Hom.
   IV., ch. 6 sq., 14 sq. Compare also Ep. 2. "A soul which has cast aside
   the ignominy of its outward form, which is no longer ruled by shameful
   thoughts or violated by evil desires, has manifestly become a partner
   of the heavenly bridegroom; for henceforth it has only one requirement.
   Stung by love to him it demands and, to speak boldly, longs for the
   immediate fulfilment of a spiritual and mysterious union that it may
   enter the indissoluble embrace of communion in sanctification." See
   Cyril Catech. III., ch. 16; kai genoito pantas humas amomos to noeto
   numphio parastantas k.t.l. Before this: he gar proteron doule psuche
   nun adelphidoun auton ton despoten epegrapsato, hos ten anupokriton
   apodechomenos proairesin epiphonesei; Idou ei kale he plesion mou, idou
   ei kale; odontes sou hos agelai ton kekarmenon (Cantic. 4, 1) dia ten
   eusuneideton homologian. We can point to very few Greek Fathers in whom
   the figure does not occur. All the greater is the contrast presented by
   the depreciatory verdict of Theodore of Mopsuestia on the Song of Songs
   (Kihn, Theodor v. M. 1880, p. 69 f.). It may be expressly noticed,
   besides, that Clement of Alex. as well as Methodius and Macarius had
   already transferred the figure of the bride to the married woman.
   Indeed, Macarius was conscious that he was acting boldly in doing so.
   Western nuns and monks were distinguished by lavishing those sexual
   feelings which were forbidden them on Christ (and Mary). Ambrose
   especially taught the West the conception of the soul as the bride of
   Christ; while Augustine was, apart from a few passages, more reserved,
   and Jerome wanted strength in sentiment and language. Not only in
   Ambrose's tractate "De Isaac et anima", really a commentary on the Song
   of Songs, but in innumerable passages in his works -- even when it is
   least expected, as in the consolatory discourse on Valentinian's death
   (ch. 59 sq.) -- the idea of a special tie between the virgin soul and
   Christ comes to the front. But Ambrose gave it a colouring of his own
   due to the deep sentiment of a great man, and his peculiar faculty of
   giving a warm expression to his personal love of Christ (see also
   Prudentius); compare passages like De poenit. II. 8. We cannot
   appreciate too highly the important influence exerted on after times,
   and first on Augustine, by Ambrose's expression of his personal
   religion. The light that dawned in Augustine's confessions already
   shone from the works of Ambrose, and it was the latter, not the former,
   who conducted western piety to the specific love of Christ. On the
   mysticism of Macarius, who was in many respects allied to these western
   Christians, compare also the details in F√∂rster (in the Jahrb. f.
   deutsche Theol. 1873, p. 439 f.). Bigg (the Christian Platonists of
   Alex., p. 188 f.) has very rightly seen that Origen's homilies on the
   Song of Songs were at the root of Christian mysticism: "This book gave
   welcome expression to what after the triumph of Athanasius was the
   dominant feeling, and redeemed in some degree the name of its author,
   damaged by his supposed inclination to Arianism. And thus Origen, the
   first pioneer in so many fields of Christian thought, the father in one
   of his many aspects of the English Latitudinarians, became also the
   spiritual ancestor of Bernard, the Victorines, and the author of the De
   Imitatione, of Tauler, and Molinos and Mme. de Guyon."

   [330] Church history has at this point in its investigations to collect
   the numerous data which prove how deeply members of the Church had
   become involved in heathen polytheistic morals, usages, customs, and
   conceptions, how strong reliance on sacred witchcraft, amulets, and
   sacramental vehicles had grown, and how far stability and peace of
   heart and mind had been lost. For the latter we can especially compare
   Eusebius (H. E. VIII. 1), (further the epitaph of Damasus on Euseb. the
   Roman Bishop, in Duchesne, Le liber Pontificalis, Tom. I., 1885, p.
   167); of a later date, Cyril, Catech. 15, ch. 7. As regards syncretism,
   see the work on the Egyptian mysteries (ed. Parthey).

   [331] See the short disclaimers in the fourth Catechism of Cyril of
   Jerusalem, (ch. 7. 8): Ouch, hos tines enomisan, ho huios meta to
   pathos stephanotheis hosper hupo tou Theou dia ten hupomonen elabe ton
   en dexia thronon, all' aph' houper estin echei to basilikon axioma
   . . . Mete apallotrioses tou patros ton huion, mete sunaloiphen
   ergasamenos huiopatrian pisteuses.. Further, the 11th Catechism. So
   also Athanasius steadily disavows the heresy of the Adoptians as well
   as of the Sabellians.

   [332] See Vol. III, p. 103.

   aidiou..

   [334] See Vol. III., p. 110.

   [335] See Vol. III, p. 102.

   [336] On Eusebius' Christology see Dorner, Lehre v. d. Person Christi,
   I. (1845) p. 792 ff. Lee, on the Theophan. 1843, Preliminary Dissert.
   The Christology of Euseb. is that of the ancient apologists,
   approximating in its terms to Neoplatonic speculations and richer in
   its phases on account of the many antitheses. In spite of his
   dependence on Origen, Euseb. was chary of receiving all the ideas and
   predicates which the former applied to the Son and to which orthodoxy
   afterwards appealed. That is of consequence. Euseb. was more convinced
   than Origen that the idea of deity was completely exhausted in that of
   the strictly one and unchangeable on the prote ousia; he separated the
   deuteros Theos much further from God than the Apologists; see Zahn,
   Marcell., p. 37 f.

   [337] Gwatkin says very justly in Studies of Arianism (1882), p. 52:
   "In fact Christendom as a whole was neither Arian nor Nicene. If the
   East was not Nicene, neither was it Arian, but conservative: and if the
   West was not Arian, neither was it Nicene, but conservative also.
   Conservatism, however, had different meanings in East and West." In the
   East it was considered conservative to uphold the formulas of Origen
   strengthened against Sabellianism. On the doctrine of the Logos and
   Christ in Origen Bigg says very truly (The Christian Platonists of
   Alex., p. 182): "What struck later ages as the novelty and audacity of
   Origen's doctrine was in truth its archaism and conservatism."

   [338] When theology is engaged in forming dogmas, it has never, as is
   really self-evident, enjoyed the sympathy of any large section in the
   Church. There is nothing to support the contention that the Christian
   Church passed through a period -- from Origen up to the Synod of
   Chalcedon or A.D. 431 -- during which there prevailed universally, or
   even to a great extent, a supreme interest in the abstract form of the
   contents of Religion, and an effort, with all the means at hand, to
   expound it as exactly as possible. The great mass of Bishops, monks,
   and laity, were then wholly occupied in satisfying themselves with what
   had been given. This was the highest demand of the Catholic religion
   itself, which presupposed the "Apostolic" as its foundation, which
   called everything else "heresy" (neoterismos), and as an institution
   for worship) did not permit changes. Undoubtedly, the period from
   Origen, or say, from Athanasius up to the Ephesian Council, appears
   unique in the history of the Church. But that was an episode enacted in
   opposition to the great body of Christians, and the theological leaders
   themselves, in proportion to their piety, conceived their task to be
   compulsory, dangerous, and ensnaring them in guilt. To prove the former
   read Socrates' Church History (see my discussion in Herzog R. E., Vol.
   XIV. p. 408 ff.). This man was, on the one hand, orthodox at every
   point, on the other, an enthusiastic partisan of Hellenike paideia,
   full of veneration for the great Origen and his science, which he held
   was to be fostered continually. But the production of dogma by
   scientific theology was repugnant to him in every sense, i.e., he
   accused and execrated dogmatic controversies as much in the interest of
   a dogma fixed once for all as in that of science. The Nicene Symbol
   belonged sufficiently to the past to be accepted by him as holy and
   apostolical; but beyond this every new formula seemed to Socrates,
   pernicious, the controversies sometimes fights in the dark
   (nyktomachies), sometimes an outflow of deceptive sophistry and
   ambitious rivalry: siope proskuneistho to arreton, i.e., the mystery of
   the trinity. Had Socrates lived 100 years earlier, he would not have
   been a Nicene, but a Eusebian Christian. He therefore passes very
   liberal judgments on, and can make excuses for, the latest "heretics",
   i.e., theologians who have been recently refuted by the Church. In this
   he stood by no means alone. Others, even at a later date, went still
   further. Compare Evagrius (H. E. I. 11) whose argument recalls Orig. c.
   Cels. III. 12. Dogma has been created by the small number of
   theologians who sought for precise notions, in the endeavour to make
   clear the characteristic meaning of the Christian religion (Athanasius,
   Apollinaris, Cyril). That these notions, separated from their
   underlying thought, fell into the hands of ambitious ecclesiastical
   politicians, that the latter excited the fanaticism of the ignorant in
   their support, and that the final decision was often due to motives
   which had nothing to do with the case, is admittedly undeniable. But
   the theologians are not therefore to blame, who opposed in the Church a
   lazy contentment with mystery, or an unlimited pursuit of scientific
   speculation. Their effort to make clear the essence of Christianity, as
   they understood it, and at the same time to provide a logike latreia,
   was rather, next to the zealous order of monks with whom they were
   intimately connected, the sole great feature in the epoch. They set
   themselves to stem the vis inerti√¶ of the pious, and with the highest
   success. When indolence in the end held the field, an important result
   had at any rate been attained. The period from Athanasius till about
   the middle of the fifth century was in many respects the brilliant
   epoch of theology in the Church. Not even the age of Scholasticism can
   compare with it. That the work of the theologians became faith
   according to the Church -- a thing Origen never thought of -- involved
   its strength and weakness alike. The fanaticism of the masses for
   dogmatic and philosophical catch-words -- see the amusing narrative of
   Gregory of Nyssa, Opp. ed. Paris, 1638, T. III. p. 466 -- affords no
   information as to the measure of their comprehension; for the dogmatic
   catch-word is merely a fetish in wide circles.

   [339] Origen's doctrine of subordination was felt in the West simply to
   constitute ditheism; see Vol. III., p. 89 ff.

   [340] See Ranke, Weltgeschichte Vol. IV. 1, p. 307: "Augustine's system
   is, if I mistake not, the second that arose in the Church; it set aside
   the peculiar characteristics of the first, that of Origen, and then
   made good its position." We can only admit that it held its ground in a
   modified sense. In fact we see here a parallel of the highest
   significance in the history of the world. The Church has produced two
   fundamental systems, Origen's and Augustine's. But the history of
   theology in the East is the history of the setting aside of Origen's
   system, and the same is to be said of the Augustinian in the Catholic
   West. Only the procedure in the East was more thorough-going and open
   than in the West. In the former Origen was condemned, in the latter
   Augustine was constantly celebrated as the greatest Doctor ecclesi√¶. In
   both cases, however, the rejection of the theological system caused the
   loss of a coherent and uniform Christian conception of the world.

   [341] It might seem as if we ought to grant the same credit to Arius of
   having reduced and given fixity to vacillating and divergent
   speculations. But apart from the contents and value of his doctrine,
   Arius was always disposed to make concessions, and as semi-opponents
   defended him, so he unhesitatingly accepted half friends for complete
   allies. This very fact proves, however, that he would never have
   succeeded in clearing up the position.

   [342] Athanasius always made a sparing use of the catch-word Homoousios
   in his works. The formula was not sacred to him, but only the cause
   which he apprehended and established under cover of the formula. His
   conduct at the Synod of Alexandria shows that he laid no stress on
   words. For his theology he needed no Creed. The existence of one in the
   Nicene was valuable to him, but he was far from worshipping Symbols.
   While many of his friends sought support in the authority of the
   formula, he sought and found it solely in the cause.

   [343] Bigg (l. c., p. 188) has very rightly called attention to the
   high value attached by orthodox Fathers after Athanasius' triumph to
   the Song of Songs in Origen's exposition.

   [344] See the Vita Anton. of Athanasius and Gregory of Naz., Orat. 21.
   It is noteworthy that Paul of Samosata and the Eusebians were worldly
   Christians. On the other hand, the puritanism of Arius is, of course,
   famous.

   [345] The Cappadocians, theologians who reconciled the faith of
   Athanasius with the current philosophy, and apprehended it abstractly,
   did not retain his teaching pure and simple. This is especially shown
   by their doubtful contention that the Christian idea of God was the
   true mean between the Jewish and Greek. They boldly characterised the
   plurality of Hypostases, e.g., as a phase of truth preserved in Greek
   polytheism. Athanasius, therefore, did not take unmixed pleasure in
   their work. Cf. the logos katechetikos of Gregory of Nyssa (ch. 4, ed.
   Oehler): "Jewish dogma is refuted by adoption of the Word, and by faith
   in the Spirit, but the illusion of the Greeks (Ellenizontes) in
   worshipping a multiplicity of Gods is dispelled by the (doctrine of
   the) unity of nature which destroys the extravagant opinion of a
   (divine) plurality. We must, in turn, retain the unity of being from
   the Jewish type of faith, and only the distinction of personal (divine)
   existences. from the Greek; and by this means godless conceptions are
   met on the left and right in correspondingly salutary ways. For the
   trinity is a corrective for those who err as to unity, just as the
   doctrine of the unity (of God) is for those who have made shipwreck by
   belief in plurality."

   "Western Church architecture " (Stuttgart, 1884), Dehio works out the
   idea that the classical period of ancient Christian architecture, the
   fourth century, was distinguished not by the multiplicity of ideas and
   forms of construction, but rather by the simplification or reduction of
   the forms. The Church, confronted by the number of models in ancient
   architecture, laid hold of one of them, the Basilica, and transmitted
   it alone to the Middle Ages. That, however, meant not a loss, but an
   advance. "The genius of Christianity contributed nothing new to the
   architectural creations of Rome and Alexandria. The great revolution it
   evoked lay in another direction. It consisted in the reduction of the
   multiplicity of styles to one dominant and sole form, not so much by a
   metamorphosis of artistic feeling, as by making religion once more the
   central motive of life. It thus assigned to the future architecture of
   the Middle Ages conditions analogous to those which governed the
   beginnings of Greek art; and thus the birth of Gothic art was possible
   at the climax of the Middle Ages -- for the second time in history, a
   true organic style, like that of the Greek temple." This observation is
   extremely instructive to the historian of dogma. The thought of
   Athanasius corresponds in theology to the meaning of the Basilica in
   the history of architecture in the fourth century. Both were happy
   simplifications from a wealth of ideas -- reductions which concealed
   full and varied contents.

   [348] The prestige of Origen in the Church was still in the first half
   of the fifth century almost absolute and incomparable in wide circles.
   As we have above remarked, the Church history of Socrates is in this
   respect particularly instructive. The belittlers and enemies of this
   man were vain and ambitious obscurantists, hero-levelling fellows;
   against them -- Methodius, Eustathius, Apollinaris, and Theophilus --
   he appealed to the testimony of Athanasius on behalf of Origen's
   orthodoxy (VI. 13). Even the view that Origen's works and utterances
   required to be sifted, appeared to him folly (VI. 17). He defended
   everything that the master wrote. It was incomprehensible to him how
   the Arians could study and value Origen, without becoming orthodox
   (VII. 6) -- to the Arians the opposite was incomprehensible -- and he
   declares with absolute conviction that Porphyry and Julian would not
   have written what they did if they had read the great teacher (III.
   23). Further, Origen was once more quoted in the Monophysite
   controversies. Apart from special uses of it, his name represented a
   great cause, namely, no less than the right of science, Hellenike
   paideia, in the Church, a right contested by traditionalism in
   conjunction with the monks.

   [349] It was pointed out above, p. 138, note I, that even orthodox
   theological leaders were not comfortable in their (dogmatic work, so
   that the position from the middle of the sixth century, the sovereign
   rule of traditionalism, was really the goal desired from the beginning.
   The works of all prominent theologians testify to this. Some deplored
   the fact that the mystery could not be worshipped in silence, that they
   were compelled to speak; and the rest say explicitly, that the truth of
   their propositions lay in their negations alone. Hilary expresses
   himself perhaps most strongly (De trinit. II. 2): "Compellimur
   h√¶reticorum et blasphemantium vitiis illicita agere, ardua scandere,
   ineffabilia eloqui, inconcessa pr√¶sumere. Et cum sola fide explorari,
   qu√¶ pr√¶cepta sunt, oporteret, adorare scilicet patrem et venerari cum
   eo filium, sancto spiritu abundare, cogimur sermonis nostri humilitatem
   ad ea, qu√¶ inenarrabilia sunt extendere et in vitium vitio coarctamur
   alieno, ut, qu√¶ contineri religione mentium oportuisset, nunc in
   periculum humani eloquii proferantur."

   [350] But for Constantine the Nicene Council would not have been
   carried through, and but for the Emperor's uniform creeds would not
   been arrived at. They were Athanasius' best coadjutors. Nay, even the
   Emperors hostile to him helped him; for they used every effort to unite
   the Church on the basis of a fixed confession. It is therefore absurd
   to abuse the State Church, and yet to regard the establishment of the
   orthodox creed as a gain.

   [351] See Hatch, The Councils and the Unity of the Church, in his
   Social Constitution of the Christian Churches, p. 172 ff.; he has given
   an excellent account of the share of the State in this unity and its
   limitations; compare also my Analekten, p. 253 ff. In the process by
   which Christendom was united externally and ecclesiastically, we can
   distinguish in the East three, and in the West four, epochs. The first
   three were common to the Churches of both East and West. The first was
   characterised by the recognition of the apostolic rule of faith in
   opposition to the erroneous creeds of heretical associations, after a
   common ideal and a common hope had united Christians up to the middle
   of the second century. The kanon tes pisteos became the basis of
   adelphotes. The second epoch, in which organisation became already of
   supreme importance, was represented in the theory of the episcopal
   office, and in the creation of the metropolitan constitution. While
   this was struggling to establish itself amid violent crises, the State
   of Constantine brought about the third epoch, in which the Church, by
   becoming completely political, was united, and thus arrived at an
   external and uniform unity, so that in it the essential nature of the
   Empire was continued. The Church became the most solid organisation in
   the Empire, because it rested on the imperial order of the ancient
   kingdom. It got no further than this organisation in the East; indeed,
   several great provincial Churches soon separated from it; for the
   creation of Constantine concealed germs of dissolution; see Zahn,
   Konstantin d. Gr. 1876, p. 31 f. In the West, on the contrary, the
   Roman Bishop began to engage in those enterprises which, favoured by
   circumstances, succeeded in the course of centuries in substituting a
   new and distinctively ecclesiastical unity for that created by the
   state.

   [352] Weltgeschichte IV. 1, p. 305 f.

   [353] On these decades, which are to be described as in many respects
   the most prosperous period of the Byzantine Church, see Herzog R. E.,
   Vol. XIV., p. 403 ff. Heathenism was then first completely overthrown,
   and the heretics, even finally the Novatians, were hard pressed. The
   regime of Chrysostom seems to have been especially signalised by the
   suppression of heretics in the patriarchate of Constantinople; see the
   account of Socrates. We know of other Bishops who were active in
   extirpating heresy in the first half of the fifth century, a work in
   which Theodoret took part. The reigns of Gratian and Theodosius, on the
   one hand, the indefatigable labours of Epiphanius on the other, laid
   the foundation. Their programme was carried out from the end of the
   fourth century. But from about the middle of the fifth century, when
   the last traces of the ancient Gnostics, Novatians and Manich√¶ans were
   substantially removed, great schisms began to take place on the basis
   of the Chalcedonian decree.

   [354] See before this Demetrius, Peter, Methodius, Eustathius,
   Marcellus, and Apollinaris.

   [355] "Babylon is fallen, fallen," -- with these words of triumph did
   Jerome accompany the overthrow of Chrysostom in the Origenist
   controversy (Ep. 88).

   [356] See Loofs, Leontius von Byzanz in the "Texten und Unters. z.
   alt-christl. Literaturgesch.," Vol. III., parts 1 and 2, p. 37 ff., 303
   ff.

   [357] The closing of the school of Athens has been disputed. It was
   certainly not a great, formal action; see Krummacher, Gesch. d. Byzant.
   Litt., p. 4.

   [358] See the works of Gass and Gelzer, especially the latter's
   interesting lecture: "Die politische und kirchliche Stellung von
   Byzanz.

   [359] Noteworthy, but not surprising, is the parallel capable of being
   drawn between the history of theology and that of (heathen) philosophy
   during the whole period from Origen to Justinian. The history of Greek
   philosophy finds its limits in the middle of the fifth century, and
   again in the age of Justinian; the same is true of the science of the
   Church. In the general history of science Plato comes to be supplanted
   by Aristotle from the close of the fifth century; in dogmatics the
   influence of the Stagirite makes itself felt to an increased extent
   from the same date. Justinian's epoch-making measures, the codification
   of the law, the closing of the school of Athens, and the restoration of
   the Byzantine Church and Empire, point to an inner connection. This has
   not escaped Ranke. On account of the importance of the matter I give
   here his excellent discussion (Vol. IV. 2, p. 20 ff.): "Justinian
   closed the school of Athens . . . An event of importance for the whole
   continued development of the human race; any further development in a
   direct line on the basis laid in classical antiquity was rendered
   impossible to the Greek spirit, while to Roman genius such an advance
   was left open and was only now rendered truly possible for after ages
   by means of the law-books. The philosophical spirit perished in the
   contentions of religious parties; the legal found a mode of expression
   which, as it were, concentrated it. The close of Greek philosophy
   recalls its beginning; nearly a thousand years had elapsed during which
   the greatest transformations in the history of the world had taken
   place. May I be permitted to add a general reflection, as to which I
   merely desire that it may not be rejected by the general feeling of
   scholars. The Christian religion had risen upon earth in the conflict
   of religious opinions waged by nations, and had then in opposition to
   these developed into a Church. Christian theology which set itself to
   appropriate the mysterious and to come to terms with the intellect had
   grown up in constant contact, sometimes of a friendly, more often of a
   hostile kind, with Greek philosophy. That was the business of those
   centuries. Then appeared the great Christian theologians from Origen
   onwards; as we said in passing, they passed through, without exception,
   Greek or closely related Latin schools, and framed their doctrines
   accordingly. Greek philosophy had produced nothing comparable to them;
   it had, as regards public life, been thrust into the background and now
   it had perished. But it is striking that the great Christian
   theologians also came to an end. Never again do we find in later times
   men like Athanasius, the Gregories of Cappadocia, Chrysostom, Ambrose
   and Augustine. I mean that along with Greek philosophy the original
   development of Christian theology also came to a stand-still. The
   energy of the Church doctors, or the importance of the Church
   assemblies in these centuries cannot be parallelled by analogous
   phenomena belonging to later times. Different as they are in themselves
   we find a certain resemblance in the state of Roman law and of
   Christian theology. The old Roman jurisprudence now appeared as
   universally valid law in a redaction which while historical was yet
   swayed by the conditions of the day. At the same time, limits were set
   by the triumph of orthodoxy, especially of the dogmas declared in the
   Chalcedonian resolutions, to all the internal divisions of theology in
   which the divergent opinions were also defended with ability and
   thoroughness . . . Justinian who reinstated orthodoxy, and gave the
   force of law to juridical conceptions, takes a high place in the
   rivalry of the centuries. Yet, while he raised his government to such a
   pinnacle of authority, he felt the ground shake momentarily under his
   feet." Greek science and the monkish view of the world, leagued as they
   were, dominated the spiritual life of the Church before as well as
   after the Justinian age; they were at bottom indeed far from being
   opposed, but possessed a common root. But how differently it was
   possible to combine them, what variations they were capable of! If we
   compare, e.g., Gregory of Nyssa with John of Damascus it is easy to see
   that the former still really thinks independently, while the latter
   confines himself to editing what is given. It is above all clear that
   the critical elements of theology had been lost. They only held their
   ground in the vagaries of mystical speculation; in all ages they are
   most readily tolerated there.

   [360] It is said of Polycarp in his Vita per Pionium (s√¶c. IV.):
   hermeneusai te hikanos musteria, ha tois pollois en apokrupha, houto
   phaneros auta exetitheto, hoste tous akouontas marturein, hoti ou monon
   akouousin alla kai horosin auta. That was accordingly the supreme
   thing; to be able also to see the mystery, the Christian possession of
   salvation.

   [361] The fight between Platonism and Aristotelianism was accordingly
   acute among theologians in the following centuries; they often indeed
   made heretics of one another. Up till now we only know these disputes
   in part; they are important for the later conflicts in the West, but
   they do not belong to the history of dogma.

   [362] Even to-day simple-minded Catholic historians of dogma exist who
   frankly admit that he becomes necessarily a heretic who does not, e.g.,
   use the conceptions "nature" and "person" correctly; and they even
   derive heresy from this starting-point. Thus Bertram (Theodoreti, Ep.
   Cyrensis, doctrina christologica, 1883) writes of Theodore of
   Mopsuestia: "Manifesto declarat, simile vel idem esse perfectam naturam
   et perfectam personam . . . Natur√¶ vox designat, quid sit aliqua res,
   vel essentiam vel quidditatem; hypostasis vero modum metaphysicum
   existendi monstrat. Ex quo patet, ad notionem perfect√¶ natur√¶ modum
   illum perfectum existendi non requiri. Hac in re erravit Mopsuestenus,
   et h√¶resis perniciosa ex hoc errore nata est. What a quid pro quo! The
   ignorance of the terminology, which was yet first created ad hoc, in
   order to escape Scylla and Charybdis, is held to be the real ground of
   the origin of the heresy. Such a view of things, which is as old as
   scholasticism, undoubtedly needed mysticism as its counterpoise, in
   order not to perish wholly from the religious sphere. Atzberger (Die
   Logoslehre d. h. Athan., 1880) has expressed himself still more
   unsophisticatedly, and therefore more instructively, on the relation of
   philosophy and dogma (p. 8, 29). But see also Hagemann (R√∂m Kirche, p.
   361): "The Patripassians arrived at their doctrines of God, his
   attributes, his creation, and incarnation, because they took their
   stand on Stoic logic and with it cherished the most extreme nominalism,
   and because they absolutely rejected the objective existence of ideas."

   [363] For the history of the development of the Greek liturgy after the
   fourth century. Swainson's The Greek Liturgies, chiefly from original
   authorities (London 1884), is the standard work. For the doctrine of
   the mysteries cf. Steitz' Abhandlungen in the Lehrbb. f. deutsche
   Theol. 1864 ff.

   [364] If we collect the fourth-century evidence of crude sensuous
   superstition intimately combined with Christian piety, we might believe
   that it could go no further. And yet it did go further from century to
   century, as anyone can easily convince himself by reading the tales of
   saints and relics, among which those of the oriental monophysites are
   the worst. But apart from this increase, we have to call attention to
   the fact that this barbarous superstition ascended into higher and more
   influential circles and was systematically cultivated by the monks,
   while the corrective of a more rational theology grew ever weaker.
   Theology became more defenceless, because it had to adapt itself to
   sacred ceremony. The worst gift bequeathed by moribund antiquity to the
   Church was the ritual of magic and the monstrous number of great and
   little aids in need and means of atonement. It is not the case that
   this state of matters was produced by the inrush of barbarian peoples;
   on the contrary, the decomposition of ancient culture and religion
   takes the first place in the process, and even the Neo-platonic
   philosophers are not free from blame. In view of this circumstance it
   is natural to conclude that the reformation of Athanasius bore little
   fruit, that it only checked for a time the polytheistic under-current,
   and, in a word, that the Church could not have got into a worse state
   than, in spite of Athanasius, it did, as regards the worship of Mary,
   angels, saints, martyrs, images and relics, and the trickery practised
   with amulets. But even if we were to go further and suggest that the
   later development of dogma itself, as e.g., in the worship of Mary and
   images, directly promoted religious materialism, yet we cannot rate too
   highly the salutary importance of this dogma. For it kept the worship
   of saints, images and the rest at the stage of a christianity of the
   second order, invested with doubtful authority, and it prevented the
   monks from cutting themselves wholly adrift from the religio publica.
   Finally, it is to be pointed out that superstition has brought with it
   at all times ideas and conceptions extremely questionable from the
   point of view of dogmatics, ideas which seem to be affected by no
   amount of censure. Overbeck (G√∂tt. Gel.-Auz. 1883, no. 28, p. 870) has
   rightly described it as a phenomenon requiring explanation that the
   gnat-straining centuries which followed Nic√¶a, could have swallowed
   such camels as, e.g., delighted the readers of the Acts of Thomas (even
   in the Catholic edition) or of the numerous Apocalypses (see the
   edition of the Apoc. Apocal. by Tischendorf and James, Apocrypha
   anecdota, 1893).

   [365] It is very characteristic as regards this, that while Cyril of
   Jerusalem described the Christian religion as mathema ton dogmaton kai
   praxeis agathai, Photius defined it as mathesis kai mustagogia. From
   the fourth century interest was more and more transferred from the
   regulation of the whole life by religion, to its external consecration
   through the mysteries. The distinctions are indeed only gradual, but
   the descent was very significant. The Greek Church ultimately gave up
   the regulation of moral social life, and therewith renounced the power
   to determine private morality so far as the latter was not dominated by
   fear of death. The ultimate reason of this is to be sought in the order
   of the monks and the constitution of the Gr√¶co-Slavic states.

CHAPTER II.

  THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTION OF SALVATION AND GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE DOCTRINAL
  SYSTEM.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I. The dogmatic conflicts in the East from the fourth up to the seventh
   century have this in common, that they centred almost entirely in
   Christology in the narrower sense, as well as in the incarnation of the
   Deity. Since men of all parties were meanwhile conscious that they were
   contending for the essence of Christianity, it follows that the
   conception of the salvation offered in the Christian religion is to be
   deduced from the formulas over which they fought, and which then made
   good their ground. This conclusion is, however, made further certain
   from the fact that the oriental Church took no interest in dogma, apart
   from those formulas, at least in the time of these conflicts. [366]
   Anything else, therefore, outside of the formulas, which was either
   fixed as matter of course, or maintained in ambiguous propositions in
   opposition to Manich√¶ism, Fatalism, and Epicureanism, did not possess
   the value of a dogmatic declaration in the strict sense. Remembering
   this, there can be no doubt that the essence of the Christian religion,
   and therefore the contents of its creed, are summed up in the following
   proposition. The salvation presented in Christianity consists in the
   redemption of the human race from the state of mortality and the sin
   involved in it, that men might attain divine life, i.e., the
   everlasting contemplation of God, this redemption having already been
   consummated in the incarnation of the Son of God, and being conferred
   on men by their close union with him: Christianity is the religion
   which delivers from death and leads to the contemplation of God. [367]
   This proposition can be more precisely defined as follows: the highest
   blessing bestowed in Christianity is adoption into the divine sonship,
   which is assured to the believer, and is completed in participation in
   the divine nature, or more accurately, in the deification of man
   through the gift of immortality. This gift includes the perfect
   knowledge and the lasting vision of God, in a blessedness void of
   suffering, but it does not do away with the interval between Christ and
   the believer. [368] From this it follows: (1) that redemption, as seen
   in its final effect, was conceived to be the abrogation of the natural
   state by a miraculous transformation of our nature; that accordingly
   (2) the supreme good was definitely distinguished from the morally
   good; and that (3) an atonement was not included in it. For atonement
   can only be thought of where the division between God and man is
   regarded as an opposition of the will. But it further follows from this
   that this theology, in agreement with the apologetic and old Catholic
   doctrine, admitted no independent object to our present life. The work
   of the Christian consisted wholly in preparing for death (to ergon tou
   Christianou ouden allo estin e meletan apothneskein In the present
   there only existed a preliminary possession of salvation. This was
   represented (1) in the knowledge of God and of the accomplished
   incarnation of the Son of God, and therewith in the certain hope of
   being deified; (2) in power over demons; (3) in the call to salvation
   and perfect acquaintance with the conditions of its reception; (4) in
   certain communications of divine Grace which supported believers in
   fulfilling those conditions--the forgiveness of sin in baptism, the
   power of certain holy rites, and holy vehicles, the example of the
   God-man etc.; and (5) in participation in the mysteries--worship and
   the Lord's supper--and in the enjoyment of the consecration they
   imparted, as also, for ascetics, in a foretaste of the future
   liberation from the senses and deification. [369]

   The certainty of faith in the future deification, however, because its
   possibility and reality, rested exclusively on the fact of the
   incarnation of the Son of God. The divine had already appeared on earth
   and had united itself inseparably with human nature.

   This conception formed the universal foundation for the development of
   dogmas in the fourth to the seventh century, though all might not
   equally understand it or see its consequences clearly. Only thus can we
   comprehend how the Church could perceive, define, and establish the
   nature of salvation in the constitution of the incarnate Son of God.
   Faith simply embraces the correct perception of the nature of the
   incarnate Logos, because this perception of faith includes the assured
   hope of a change of human nature analogous to the divinity of Jesus
   Christ, and therewith everything worth striving for. We become divine
   through him, because for our sake he became man'. But the dogmatic
   formulas corresponding to this conception only established their
   position after severe fights; they never arrived at a perfectly exact
   expression; and they never obtained the exclusive supremacy which they
   demanded.

   The reasons for this delay, inexactness, and failure to obtain
   supremacy are numerous and various. The most important deserve to be
   emphasised.

   Firstly, every new formula, however necessary it might appear, had the
   spirit of the Catholic Church against it, simply because it was new; it
   could only gain acceptance by deceiving as to its character of novelty,
   and as long as the attempt to do so was unsuccessful, it was regarded
   by the pious with suspicion. [370] Secondly, the ability of the
   Catholic Fathers really to explain their faith, and to deduce dogmatic
   consequences, was extremely slight. Grown up in the schools of
   philosophy and rhetoric, they never clearly felt it to be their duty to
   give an abstract account of their faith, however they might understand
   it. Far from describing the system of doctrine as a statement of the
   nature and contents of Christian piety, and from evolving the latter
   from its distinctive conditions, they found it difficult even to make a
   simple inference from their conception of salvation to the person of
   Christ and vice versa. Their reasoning was always being disturbed by
   apologetic or other considerations foreign to it. Energetic men, to
   whom the matter of religion should be all in all, were accordingly
   required, if an advance were to take place in the work of formulating
   it. But such men have been extremely rare. There have been few in all
   periods of the history of dogma who clearly perceived and duly
   appreciated the final interests which moved themselves. This is true of
   the ancient Church, though then matters were a little better than in
   later centuries. Thirdly, the formulas required conflicted with every
   kind of philosophy; they amounted to an offence to the thought of the
   schools. This circumstance undoubtedly might afterwards prove an
   advantage; it was possible to show the divinity and sacredness of the
   formulas by referring to their inscrutability and therefore to the
   mystery that surrounded them. But as long as the formula was still new,
   this confirmation encountered doubts, and even afterwards, in spite of
   the mystery', it was impossible to do without a philosophy which should
   interpret it, and should restore confidence, as to the contradictions,
   by new combinations of categories. Now, as long as no such philosophy
   was created, faith was not satisfied, and the formula was not
   guaranteed permanence. Fourthly, it was of the highest importance that
   by almost all the Fathers their conception of the salvation procured by
   the God-man (deification) was appended to, or bolstered up by, the
   system of natural theology'. But under this system knowledge and virtue
   were the highest blessings, and God was exclusively the judge who
   rewarded the good and punished the wicked. Now, it was undoubtedly
   possible so to combine these two lines of thought that neither was
   prejudiced, and we will see that such a combination alone corresponded
   to the ideas of those Christians, and was actually brought about. But
   it was impossible to prevent natural theology from intruding more and
   more into dogmatics, and from interfering with the success of the
   mystical doctrine of redemption--for so we may well name it. Men were
   not in a position to strike at the roots of those views of Christian
   salvation which did not definitely conceive the latter to be
   distinctive, and which therefore did not sufficiently differentiate it
   from virtue and the natural knowledge of God.

   Fifthly, the complete acceptance of the mystical doctrine of redemption
   was imperilled from another side, and this menace also could never be
   completely averted. The picture of the life of Jesus contained in the
   Gospels, in spite of all the arts of exegesis, contradicted in a way it
   was impossible to disregard the Christological formulas called for by
   the doctrine. The life even influenced the form given to the dogma of
   the incarnation and its consequences [371] to an extent which, from the
   standpoint of the theory of redemption, was questionable; and it
   subsequently always accompanied the dogmatic formulas, keeping alive in
   the Church the remnant of a conception of the Redeemer's personality
   which did not agree with them. The Church indeed never lost
   recollection of the human individuality of Jesus in its simple
   loftiness, its heart-winning love, and its holy earnestness; it never
   forgot the revelation of God in humanity. Scripture reading and, in
   part also, preaching preserved the memory, and with and by it thought
   was ever again led to the simplest and highest of facts, the love of
   God which is loftier than all reason, the rendering of service to our
   neighbour, sincere humility, and patience. But as the gospel prevented
   dogma from obtaining an exclusive supremacy, so also Pauline theology,
   and kindred views found in Holy Scripture, exerted an important
   influence, which maintained its ground side by side with the dogma, and
   often very strongly decided its exposition. That the work of Christ
   consisted in what he achieved, culminating in his sacrificial death,
   and signifying the overcoming and removal of guilt; that salvation
   accordingly consisted in the forgiveness, justification and adoption of
   men, are ideas absolutely wanting in none of the Church Fathers, and
   very prominent in a few, while in the majority they find their way into
   the exposition of the dogma of redemption. They do not agree with the
   latter, nay, in this combination can hardly be held to have deepened
   the conception in any point; for they rather menaced the finality of
   the fundamental dogmatic thought in which men lived. In fact they
   wrought mischief, i.e., they led to moral laxity, as in all cases where
   they are only allowed a secondary authority. But their existence must
   be expressly stated if our view is to be complete. New Testament
   reminiscences and thoughts and in general Biblical theological ideas of
   the most varied kind, always accompanied and impinged on dogma growing
   or full-grown. [372] They helped to delay its reduction into formulas,
   and prevented the mystical doctrine of redemption and its corresponding
   dogmas obtaining a completely exclusive supremacy in the Eastern
   Churches.

   Sixthly and finally, the scheme of Christology, distinctive of the
   West, forced on the Church by the policy of the emperors, brought a
   disturbing and confusing influence into the Eastern history of dogma.
   The Eastern Church, left to itself, could only, if it had simply given
   expression to its own idea of redemption, have raised to a dogma the
   one nature, made flesh, of God, the Logos (mia phusis theou logou
   sesarkomene), and must have left the paradox standing that the humanity
   of Christ was consubstantial (homoousios) with ours, and was yet from
   the beginning not only without sin, but free from any kind of
   corruption (phthora). This dogma was condemned as heretical in the
   process, as we know, of forming an exclusive authoritative doctrine,
   and another was set up in its place which it required the most
   elaborate efforts of theologians to connect closely with the idea of
   redemption. Conversely, as regards the doctrine of the Trinity in the
   fourth century, while the correct formula--correct, i.e., when gauged
   by the conception of redemption--triumphed, yet the considerations
   springing from natural theology and science were here so strong that
   the Eastern Church could only reconcile itself to the doctrine by the
   aid of a complicated theology, which in this case, however, was really
   heterodox, because it weakened the meaning of the formula. In the
   fourth century the correct formula triumphed, but the triumph was
   procured by a theology really heterodox; in the fifth and up to the
   seventh an incorrect formula, if gauged by the idea of redemption,
   became supreme, but theology was able to treat it orthodoxly. In view
   of these incongruities one is almost tempted to believe in the cunning
   of the idea'; for this development alone made possible, or demanded,
   the application of the whole apparatus of Platonic and Aristotelian
   philosophy to dogma. Neither the conception of the homoousios
   (consubstantial) as given by Athanasius, nor the strictly Monophysite
   form of the incarnation dogma, would have conjured philosophy anew to
   its aid, and to a greater extent than was contained in the dogma
   itself. This happened and could not but happen, because men would not
   understand omoousios as tautousios (of the same substance); and because
   they were forced to fit the two natures into their system. Dogmatics
   (the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation) became the high
   school of Philosophy. By them the Middle Ages received all that they
   ever did of philosophical thought. And these facts were due to the
   circumstance that the idea of redemption was not expressed purely and
   absolutely in dogma, that rather in the doctrine of the Trinity, as
   well as in the Christology, the formula overlapped its support, or the
   support the formula, and therefore necessarily called for endless
   exertions. Where would Plato and Aristotle have been in the Church or
   the Middle Ages if the East had honoured Athanasius and Julian of
   Halicarnassus as the sole authoritative Fathers of the Church, and how
   nearly was this the case with both! How much the East owes to the
   interference of the West, and yet, on the other hand, how greatly did
   the same West disturb it! But it is to be described as a gain from
   another point of view, that the correct formulas--those which
   corresponded to the Greek idea of redemption--did not establish their
   position. The evangelical conception of Christ was preserved to a
   greater degree in the Byzantine and Nestorian Church, based on the
   doctrine of the two natures, than in the Monophysite Churches. The
   latter only prove that the consistent development of the materialistic
   idea of redemption reduces Christianity to barbarism. The Arabians
   taught Aristotle to the Nestorians and not to the Monophysites. But
   those Churches also show that the Christ who possessed one incarnate
   nature--that phantom--reduced the historical Christ almost to the
   vanishing point. All the features of the man Christ of history, which
   the Byzantine and Nestorian Church still kept alive in their
   communities, are so many evidences that the old idea of redemption was
   forced to submit to limitations.

   But in spite of this the dogma of the God-man which sprang from the
   doctrine of redemption assumed a unique and predominant position and
   alone constituted dogma in the strict sense. Theology = the doctrine of
   the Trinity, Economy = the idea and realisation of the Incarnation. The
   course of development also shows by its inner logic, which indeed, as
   already pointed out, was not so stringent as more recent scholars would
   have us believe, that it was in this dogma that the strongest interest
   was taken. After Athanasius had proved the necessity and realisation of
   redemption through the incarnation of the Son of God, the
   consubstantiality (Homoousia) of the Son of God with God himself was
   first established. Then the fact was emphasised that the Incarnate was
   constituted similarly with man, and finally, the unity of deity and
   humanity in the incarnate Son of God was settled. The historian of
   dogma has here simply to follow the course of history. It is in this
   connection by no means clear how besides this the work of the God-man
   is to be treated. As regards the work of Christ we can only deal with
   conceptions' which are not firmly allied to the dogma. But we have to
   remark finally, that not only in theory was the dogma planned
   eschatologically, i.e., with a view to the future life, but that also
   in practice faith in the imminent approach of the end of the world
   still influenced the pious. In a few Fathers this faith undoubtedly
   held a subordinate place; but yet it formed the rule, and the storms
   caused by the invasion of the tribes as well as the political
   revolutions constantly gave it strength.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [366] Very instructive in this respect is the Church History of
   Socrates. A man's orthodoxy is completely decided for him by his
   attitude to the dogma of the Trinity (see H. E. III. 7, VI. 13, VII. 6,
   11). The Cappadocians and the theologians after Socrates held similar
   views; see Gregory of Naz. Orat. XXVII. 10: "Philosophise about the
   world and worlds, matter, the soul, rational beings, good and bad
   alike, about resurrection, judgment, and retribution, and the
   sufferings of Christ. For if on these points you hit on the truth it is
   not without service, but if you fail, you can suffer no harm" (cf.
   Ullmann, Gregory of Naz., 1867, p. 217 f.). We have also to consider
   here the contents of the oriental symbols, creed-decalogues etc. The
   interest taken to an increasing extent from the fifth century in the
   tenets levelled against Origen was biblical and traditional. It only
   became dogmatic at a time when in theology and Christology the
   influence of "antiquity" had taken the place of that of dogma. On the
   place and importance of the doctrine of the Trinity in Gregory, see
   Ullman, p. 232 ff.

   [367] I share fully the view of Kattenbusch ( Confessionskunde I., p.
   296) that the dogma was not merely supported by one idea, and that in
   the Greek Church of to-day the idea of redemption held by the ancient
   Church no longer rules directly; but this view does not contradict the
   exposition given in the text.

   [368] The fact that the idea of deification was the ultimate and
   supreme thought is not a discovery of recent times, but it is only in
   recent times that it has been appreciated in all its importance. After
   Theophilus, Iren√¶us, Hippolytus, and Origen, it is found in all the
   Fathers of the ancient Church, and that in a primary position, We have
   it in Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Apollinaris, Ephraem Syrus,
   Epiphanius, and others, as also in Cyril, Sophronius, and late Greek
   and Russian theologians. In proof of it Psalm LXXXII. 6 is very often
   quoted -- "I said ye are gods and all sons of the most High." Just as
   often are theopoiesis and athanasia expressly combined. Some Fathers
   feel the boldness of the formula; but that is very rare. I select
   merely a few from my collection of passages: Athanas. de incarn. 54:
   "Autos enenthropesen, hina hemeis theopoiethomen, kai autos ephanerosen
   heauton dia somatos, hina hemeis tou aoratou patros ennoian labomen,
   kai autos hupemeinen ten par' anthropou hubrin, hina hemeis athanasian
   kleronomesomen, cf. Ep. ad Serap. I. 24, Orat. c. Arian. I. 38, 39, and
   often; Vita Antonii, c. 74, Ephraem, Comment. in Diatess., init. (ed.
   Moesinger, p. 1): "Quare dominus noster carnem induit? Ut ipsa caro
   victori√¶ gaudia gustaret et dona grati√¶ explorata et cognita haberet.
   Si deus sine carne vicisset, qu√¶ ei tribuerentur laudes? Secundo, ut
   dominus noster manifestum faceret, se initio creationis nequaquam ex
   invidia prohibuisse, quominus homo fieret deus, quia maius est, quod
   dominus noster in homine humiliabatur, quam quod in eo, dum magnus et
   gloriosus erat, habitabat. Hinc illud: Ego dixi, dii estis'." Gregory
   of Nyss., Colloq. cum Macrina (ed. Oehler, p. 170): Ton oun toiouton
   tais dia tou puros iatreiais ekkatharthenton te kai aphagnisthenton,
   hekaston ton pros to kreitton nooumenon anteiseleusetai, he aphtharsia,
   he zoe, he time, he charis, he doxa, he dunamis, kai ei ti allo
   toiouton auto te to Theo epitheoreisthai eikazomen. Gregory of Naz.,
   Orat. 40, c. 45 (Decalogus fidei, ed Caspari, Alte und Neue Quellen,
   1879, p. 21): pisteue ton huion tou Theou . . . tosouton anthropon dia
   se, hoson su gine di' ekeinon Theos. So also Orat. I. 5: "We become
   like Christ, since Christ also became like us; we become gods on his
   account, since he also became man for our sake." On the other hand,
   compare Orat. XLII. 17: meth' hemon to ktisma, ton ou Theon; ei ktisma
   de, ou Theos, and XXXIX. 17: "How should he not be God, to insert in
   passing a bold deduction, by whom thou also dost become God?"
   Apollinaris Laod., Kata meros pistis (ed. Lagarde, p. 110): phamen
   anthropon gegenesthai ton tou Theou logon, hina ten homoiosin tou
   epouraniou labomen kai theopoiethomen. Macar., hom. 39.
   Pseudo-hippolytus, Theophan. (ed. Lagarde, p. 41, 21): ei oun athanatos
   gegonen ho anthropos, estai kai theos. Dionys. Areopag., s√¶pissime,
   e.g., de c√¶lesti hierar. c. 1: he hemon analogos theosis. Sophronius,
   Christmas Sermon (ed. Usener, Rhein. Mus. f√ºr Philologie, 1886, p.
   505): theothomen theiais metabolais kai mimesesin. Leo, Patriarch of
   Russia ( Pawlow, p. 126): etheothemen Theou te metalepsei. Gennadius,
   Confess. (ed. Kimmel, p. 10): "dixit deus: Induam me carne . . . et
   erit omnis homo tamquam deus non secundum naturam sed secundum
   participationem." We have, however, to notice that this deification, as
   understood by the Greek Church, did not by any means signify roundly
   "Becoming like God". The Greeks in the main did not connect any clear
   conception with the thought of the possession of salvation (felicity)
   further than the idea of imperishableness; and this very fact was their
   characteristic feature. It is the ineffable, the transcendent which may
   therefore be described as the theia phusis, because it is enjoyed for
   ever. The interval between Christ -- who was born, and did not become,
   Son of God -- and the sons by adoption is always very strongly
   emphasised; compare (the precise expositions in Augustine, De remiss.
   pace. II. 24) and above all, Athanasius' third discourse against the
   Arians; further, Cyril Catech. II., ch. 4-7 and 19. Yet the theosis of
   Mary forms a kind of exception. The idea of deification is also found
   in Western writers, especially Augustine. But if I am not deceived
   Augustine himself brought it to an edifying end.

   [369] Athanasius (Ep. encycl. ad episc. √Ügypt. et Lib. ch. I.) mentions
   as the gifts of grace already possessed by Christians: (1) the type of
   the heavenly mode of life, (2) power over demons, (3) adoption to be
   sons, (4) and what is exalted and rises high above every gift--the
   knowledge of the Father and the Word himself and the grant of the Holy
   Spirit. This list is not quite complete.

   [370] See above, p. 137, f.

   [371] In the introductory fourth Catechism in which Cyril summarises
   the, main points of the faith, he says (ch. IX.): pisteue de hoti
   houtos ho monogenes huios tou Theou dia tas hamartias hemon ex ouranon
   katelthen epi tes ges. (ch. X.): houtos estaurothe huper ton hamartion
   hemon. Nothing is said of the abolition of death. So also in the
   Homilies of Chrysostom who generally tried to follow Paul, sin comes to
   the front. The saying "Let us not fear death, but only sin," is often
   repeated with variations by Chrysostom. Alexander of Alex. also in his
   letter to Alexander (Theodoret H. E. I. 4) gives as the only ground of
   the incarnation of the Son of God, that he came eis athetesin
   hamartias, but he is unable to carry out the thought.

   [372] The contradictions and inconsistencies were not felt if it was
   possible to support the separate propositions by an appeal to Holy
   Scripture: see on this Vol. II., p. 331, n. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   II. In relation to the blessing of salvation man is receptive and
   passive. He receives it in this world in the hope of his faith, and
   enjoys it in the other as a transcendently glorious gift of grace. God
   alone can grant it, and no human effort can deserve it. As we have
   already noticed, this religious blessing of salvation is wholly
   different from moral goodness; for moral goodness cannot be presented,
   but must be gained by our own actions. On the other hand, Christianity
   as a religion cannot take up a neutral attitude to moral goodness, but
   must rather embrace the loftiest morality. That was also the universal
   conviction of the Greek Church and its theologians. The problem which
   thus arose was solved without noteworthy vacillations, and in the sense
   of the theology of the apologists and Origen. It was assumed that
   freedom in the moral sphere corresponded to receptivity in the domain
   of religion and the blessings of salvation conferred by it; and that
   God attached the grant of the religious blessing of salvation to the
   achievement of a perfectly moral life, whose law, though not new, had
   first found expression in the Christian religion as something perfect
   and capable of being easily recognised. The scheme of nature and grace
   current in the West since Augustine, was not entirely unknown in the
   East, so far as words were concerned. [373] But the latter already
   found "grace" in "nature", i.e., in the inalienable natural disposition
   to freedom, and, on the other hand, conceived "grace" to be the
   communication of a higher nature. Hence the above scheme was not
   adapted to express Greek thought. Christianity was rather, on the one
   hand, the perfect law of goodness, and, on the other, a promise and
   sure pledge of immortality. [374] It was therefore holy living and
   correct faith. The convictions that God himself is the good; that he is
   the creator of the inalienable reason and freedom of man; that the
   perfect morality of man represents the only form of his similarity to
   God attainable in the sphere of the temporal and created; that the
   supreme law of goodness, hitherto obscured, has been once more revealed
   to men in the Christian religion, and that in the most impressive way
   imaginable--by the deity in a human form; finally, that the religious
   blessing of salvation procured by Christ contains the strongest motive
   to practise morality, [375] while it also includes mysterious forces
   which promote it: these convictions, according to the conception of
   Greek theologians, bound religion and morality together as closely as
   possible, and, since only the good man could receive salvation,
   guaranteed the character of Christianity as the moral religion. The
   monk Sophronius (seventh century) says in his Christmas Sermon:
   "Therefore the Son of God assumed human poverty, that he might make us
   gods by grace; and the divine father David sings in his psalms . . . I
   said, ye are gods and all sons of the highest. God is in us; let us
   become gods by divine transformations and imitations" (Dia touto ho
   huios tou Theou anthropinen ptocheian enduetai ina theous hemas
   apergasetai chariti. kai tauta melodon ho theopator Dabid . . . . Ego
   eipa; Theoi este kai huioi hupsistou pantes. Theos en hemin; theothomen
   theiais metabolais kai mimesesin). [376] In the last phrase the Greek
   fundamental thought is put into a classic form. Only we must not take
   "metabolais" and "mimesesin" to be equivalent. The former signifies the
   actual process, the latter its condition and form; not the sufficient
   reason, as is proved by "chariti." [377] There is, however, a form of
   morality which does not appear to be merely subordinate to religious
   faith and hope, but which anticipates the future blessings, or puts man
   into the condition of being able to receive them immediately. This is
   negative morality, or asceticism. It corresponds in a true sense to the
   characteristic of the religious gift of salvation; it is also therefore
   no longer a mere adjunct to the latter, but it is the adequate and
   essential disposition for the reception of salvation. But in so far as
   ecstasy, intuition, and the power of working miracles can be combined
   with it, it forms the anticipation of the future state. The ultimate
   rule of this conception of Christianity may accordingly be compressed,
   perhaps, into the saying: "Dost thou desire the supreme good,
   incorruption (aphtharsia), then divest thyself of all that is
   perishable." Side by side with this we have the more general rule "Dost
   thou desire the supreme good, then first be good and nourish the new
   nature implanted in thee in Baptism by the Eucharist and the other
   mysterious gifts." The extent to which all this was connected with
   Christ is shown by the saying of Clemens Alex. (Protrept. I. 7)--a
   saying which retained its force in after times: "Appearing as a teacher
   he taught the good life, in order that afterwards as God he might grant
   everlasting life" (to eu zen edidaxen epiphaneis hos didaskalos, hina
   to aei zen husteron hos Theos choregese).

   This whole conception of the importance of morality needed, however, no
   doctrinal and specific description, any more than the nature of
   morality and the principles of natural theology in general. All that
   was already settled in its fundamental lines; man knew it by his own
   reason; it formed the self-evident presupposition of the doctrine of
   redemption. The very freedom used by the Church Fathers in dealing with
   details shows that here they were treating matters generally recognised
   and only called in question by Manich√¶ans, Fatalists, etc., and that it
   was therefore unnecessary to have recourse to revelation. In describing
   the dogma of the Greek Fathers, therefore, we have to consider their
   views of the nature of salvation, [378] of God as the Good and the
   Giver of salvation, of the state and duties of man, etc., on the one
   hand, as a kind of a priori presuppositions of the doctrine of
   redemption; but, on the other, as individual conceptions, framed partly
   from contemporary philosophy, and partly from the Bible. They certainly
   have a right to a place in a description of the complete view taken by
   the ancient Church of Christianity; but as certainly they cannot be
   called dogmas; for dogmas are as essentially different from
   self-evident presuppositions as from fluctuating conceptions. Our only
   reason for discussing them in the history of dogma is that we may guard
   dogma from misunderstanding and correctly mark off the space due to it.
   [379] The Greek conception of Christianity has, like an ellipse, two
   centres: the doctrine of liberty, which embraces the whole of rational
   theology, Stoic and Platonic, and the doctrine of the actual
   redemption, which is supranatural. Supranatural as it was it admitted a
   relationship to natural theology, just as, conversely, freedom was
   regarded as a gift of divine grace. We find, indeed, that the two
   centres were first brought into the greatest possible proximity by the
   negative morality. Therefore from this point also the achievements of
   positive morality necessarily appear as a minimum to which the shadow
   of essential imperfection always clings.

   It follows from the above exposition that the doctrines of God, the
   world, and man--with freedom and sin, are to be prefixed, as
   presuppositions and conceptions, to dogma, i.e., the doctrines of the
   godman, while they are only to be discussed in so far as such
   discussion is required for the comprehension of dogma. But this does
   not complete the list of our tasks; the whole presentment of dogma must
   be prefaced by a chapter treating of the sources of our knowledge and
   our authorities, i.e., Scripture, tradition, and the Church. So also we
   must at the close examine the mysterious application of redemption--the
   mysteries--and all that is connected with it.The following arrangement
   of our material, in which a systematic exposition forms the basis of
   the historical, because the foundations of our view have not changed
   since the time of Origen, will thus be appropriate.

   Supplement 1.--The Greek conception of Christianity appears undoubtedly
   to be exceedingly compact and clear, as long as we do not look too
   deeply into the heart of it. The freeing of dogmatics of all matters
   which do not fall within the scope of the doctrine of redemption is
   very remarkable. But these advantages are purchased, first, by
   abandoning any attempt to establish an inner unity between the supreme
   notions of "moral good" and "blessedness" (imperishableness); secondly,
   by the depreciation of positive morality in favour of asceticism;
   thirdly, by completely caricaturing the historical Christ. But the
   knowledge of the Christian faith possessed by the Fathers up to the
   middle of the fifth century was still far from being in the desolate
   state in which theology makes no resolute attempt to deduce the
   consequences of a doctrine, while it does not venture to abandon it,
   but contents itself with perceiving "a profound element of truth" in
   any or every theologoumenon brought to it by tradition. The idea of the
   Greek Fathers, to which everything was subordinate, that Christianity
   is the religion which delivers from perishableness and death, was
   derived from the ancient Catholic Church. It presents itself as a
   specific limitation of primitive Christian hopes under the influence of
   views held by the ancients. It is possible to express it in a grand and
   awe-inspiring form, and this the Greek Fathers understood. Further,
   where misery, mortality, and finitude are felt to be the heaviest
   burdens laid upon men, the supreme good can be nothing but endless,
   blessed rest. In so far as the Greek Fathers perceived and firmly
   believed in this gift being conferred by the Christian religion, while
   they connected its bestowal with Jesus Christ, they assigned to
   Christianity the highest conceivable significance, and to its founder
   the highest conceivable dignity, within their range of vision. But the
   mood which looked on Christianity from this point of view and regarded
   it as consolatory, was that of the fall and ruin of the ancient world,
   which no longer possessed the power to turn earnestly to an energetic
   life. Without premising this the dogmatic developments are not
   intelligible. But we cannot retain the formulas of the Greek faith
   without self-deception, if we change or refuse to admit the validity of
   its premises. But if we are ready honestly to retain them, then let us
   clearly understand to what Orthodoxy and Monophysitism came in the
   East. After they had piled one monstrosity on the top of the other,
   they were--to use a strong figure of Goethe's--almost choked in chewing
   the cud of moral and religious absurdities. Originally their doctrine
   was good for nothing in the world but for dying; afterwards they became
   deadly sick on this very doctrine.

   Supplement 2.--If the conception of the supreme good may be regarded as
   a revised version, made by Greek philosophy, of the ancient Christian
   hopes of the future, yet this philosophy always rejected the idea of
   the incarnation of God, and therefore could not, in its definition of
   the supreme good, attain the certainty which was given in the Christian
   conception. In the fourth and fifth centuries, however, there were even
   Christian theologians--Synesius, for example--who would not admit the
   incarnation of God without revision, and yet held by the thought of
   deification; who accordingly approached, not rationalistic, but rather
   pantheistic views. At any rate, faith in the incarnation of God, along
   with the idea of creation, formed the dividing line between Greek
   philosophy and the dogmatics of the Church. "For what," says
   Athanasius, de incarn. 41, "is absurd or ridiculous in our teaching,
   except merely our saying that the Logos was made manifest in a human
   body?" (ti gar atopon, e ti chleues par' hemin axion, e pantos hoti ton
   logon en somati pephanerosthai legomen;). [380] On the other hand, the
   Christian says (Cyril, Catech. 4, ch. 9): "If the incarnation was a
   dream, then salvation is also a dream." (Ei phantasma en he
   enanthropesis, phantasma kai he soteria). That is the confession which
   in the Greek Church was the equivalent of 1 Cor. XV. 17 f.

   Supplement 3.--In order to learn the classical form of Greek piety, the
   strongest root of dogma, it is necessary to study the literature of
   asceticism. For it seldom comes clearly to light in the dogmatic,
   apologetic, and polemical works, with the exception of the writings of
   Athanasius, and in the homiletic literature, apart from Chrysostom, it
   is always greatly disguised by rhetoric. But a distinction must be made
   even in ascetic literature. The descriptions of the piety of monkish
   heroes lose themselves as a rule in extravagance and eccentricity, and
   are not typical because the writers set out to prove the already
   supramundane character of those heroes. We have especially to examine
   numerous writings on "the resurrection," "virginity," "perfection," and
   similar subjects, and also the practical homilies. We obtain perhaps
   the clearest and truest impression of the piety of the Greek Church
   from reading the biography of sister Macrina, by Gregory of Nyssa
   (Oehler, Biblioth. d. KVV. I. 1, 1858, p. 172 ff.). The dying prayer
   put in her lips (p. 213 f.) is given here because it expresses
   inimitably the hopes and consolation of Greek Christianity, yet without
   omitting the characteristic warmth of feeling which belonged to its
   very essence.

   "Her prayer was such that one could not doubt that she was with God,
   and heard his voice. She said: Thou, Lord, hast for us destroyed the
   fear of death. Thou hast made the end of this earthly life the
   beginning of the true life. Thou makest our bodies rest for a time in
   sleep, and dost awaken them again with the last trumpet. Thou givest
   our clay, which Thou didst fashion with Thy hands, to the earth to keep
   it, and Thou takest again what Thou didst give, and dost transform into
   imperishableness and beauty that which was mortal and unseemly. Thou
   hast snatched us from the curse and sin, having Thyself become both for
   us. Thou hast crushed the heads of the dragon, which had grasped man
   with its jaw in the abyss of disobedience. Thou hast paved the way of
   the resurrection for us, having shattered the gate of Hades, and
   destroyed him who had the power of death. Thou has given those who fear
   Thee the image of Thy holy cross for a sign for the destruction of the
   adversary and the safety of our life. Eternal God, to Whom I was
   dedicated from the womb, Whom my soul has loved with all its power, to
   Whom I have consecrated my flesh and my soul from my youth and till
   now! Place Thou an angel of light by my side to lead me to the place of
   quickening where is the source of rest in the bosom of the Holy
   Fathers. Oh Thou who didst break the flaming sword, and didst restore
   to Paradise the man crucified with Thee who begged Thy mercy. Remember
   me, too, in Thy kingdom, because I also am crucified with Thee,
   piercing my flesh with nails from fear of Thee, and fainting in dread
   of Thy judgments! May the awful abyss not divide me from Thine elect,
   nor the calumniator block my way; may my sin not be found before Thine
   eyes, if I, having failed through the weakness of our nature, should
   have sinned in word, or deed, or thought! Thou who hast power on earth
   to forgive sins, grant me forgiveness, that I may be quickened, and
   when I put off my body may I be found by Thee without stain in my soul,
   so that my soul, spotless and blameless, may be received into Thy hands
   like a sacrifice before Thy presence."

   Supplement 4.--For centuries after the great work of Theognostus, which
   we only know very imperfectly, no complete system of scientific
   theology was written in the East. The idea of a system was in itself a
   philosophical one, and for its execution all that was in existence were
   examples whose authority was already shaken. Platonism only contributed
   to form a heterodox system. Aristotelianism with its formal logic,
   which triumphed over all difficulties, first succeeded in creating an
   orthodox system. Systematic works, in the period up to Johannes
   Damascenus, fall into the following lists.

   (1) On the incarnation of the Logos--or Son of God. In these works the
   central question of Greek dogma is discussed. The title varies, or is
   more precise, according to the standpoint of each: "On the two
   natures", "On not confounding the natures", etc. Under this head come
   also the polemical, dogmatic tractates--against Arius, Marcellus,
   Eunomius, Apollinaris, Nestorius, etc.--as well as dogmatic
   monographs--on the Holy Ghost, the Trinity, etc. We have to notice
   finally the Expositiones veritatis at the close of the writings against
   the heretics, like those found, after the precedent of Hippolytus, in,
   e.g., Epiphanius and Theodoret.

   (2) Exposition of Christian doctrines in catechetical form. Here
   Cyril's catechisms are especially important. [381] The catechism was
   always bound by the Symbol, but the Symbol necessitated the treatment
   of the main points of Jesus' history as points of doctrine, and the
   expiscation of their exact value for faith. Thus dogma gained an
   important supplement from the exposition of the Symbol. The decalogue
   of the creed by Gregory of Nazianzus also falls to be mentioned here.
   In the great catechism of Gregory of Nyssa catechetic treatment is
   combined with apologetic. Instructions how to pursue theological
   science came from the Antiochene school and thence penetrated into the
   West--Junilius--where Augustine had already written his work De
   doctrina Christiana. So far as I know, the older Byzantine Church
   possessed no such instructions.

   (3) Apologetic works in reference to heathens and Jews. In these,
   natural theology--the monotheistic faith and doctrine of freedom--is
   unfolded, and the Christian view of history, as well as the proof of
   its antiquity, presented in opposition to polytheism and ceremonial
   religions; so in several works by Eusebius, Apollinaris, Cyril of
   Alexandria, etc.

   (4) Monographs on the work of the six days, on the human soul, the
   body, the immortality of the soul, etc. In these, also, natural
   theology is developed and the scientific cosmology and psychology in
   the oldest sources of the Bible stated.

   (5) Monographs on virginity, monachism, perfection, the virtues, the
   resurrection. Here the ultimate and supreme practical interests of
   piety and faith find expression.

   (6) Monographs on the mysteries, cultus and priesthood. These are not
   numerous in the earlier period--yet instruction in the sacraments and
   their ritual was regularly attached to the training in the Symbol; see
   the Catechisms of Cyril which form a guide to the mysteries Their
   number, however, increased from the sixth century.

   Copious, often intentionally elaborated, dogmatic material, finally, is
   also contained in scientific commentaries on the Biblical books and in
   the Homilies.

   The right use for the history of dogma of these different kinds of
   sources is an art of method for which rules can hardly be given. The
   rhetorical, exegetical, philosophical, and strictly dogmatic
   expositions must be recognised as such and distinguished. At the same
   time we have to remember that this was an age of rhetoric which did not
   shrink from artifices and untruths of every kind. Jerome admits that in
   the works of the most celebrated Fathers one must always distinguish
   between what they wrote argumentatively (dialektikos), and what they
   set down as truth. Basilius also (Ep. 210) was at once prepared to
   explain a. heterodox passage in Gregory Thaumaturgus, by supposing that
   he had been speaking not dogmatically (dogmatikos), but for the sake of
   argument (agonistikos). So also Athanasius excuses Origen on the ground
   that he wrote much for the sake of practice and investigation (De
   decretis synod. Nic.27, cf. ad Serap. IV. 9); and while completely
   defending the Christology of Dionysius Alex., he remarks that the
   latter in many details spoke from policy (kat' oikonomian). The same
   stock excuse was seized upon by the Fathers at Sardica in the case of
   Marcellus. According to this, how often must the great writers of the
   fourth and fifth centuries themselves have written for the sake of
   argument (agonistikos)! Moreover, Gregory of Nazianzus speaks of a
   necessary and salutary oikonomethenai ten aletheian, i.e., of the
   politic and prudent disguise and the gradual communication of the
   truth; and he appeals in support of this to God himself who only
   revealed the truth at the fitting time, oikonomikos (Orat. 41. 6, Ep.
   26). Cyrus declares, in the monothelite controversy, that one must
   assume kat' oikonomian a not altogether correct dogma, in order to
   attain something of importance.

   Some, however, went much farther in this matter. As they did not hold
   themselves bound to stick to the truth in dealing with an opponent, and
   thus had forgotten the command of the gospel, so they went on in
   theology to impute untruthfulness to the Apostles, citing the dispute
   between Paul and Peter, and to Christ (he concealed his omniscience,
   etc.). They even charged God with falsehood in dealing with his enemy,
   the devil, as is proved by the views held by Origen, Gregory of Nyssa,
   and most of the later Fathers, of redemption from the power of the
   devil. But if God himself deceived his enemy by stratagem (pia fraus),
   then so also might men. Under such circumstances it cannot be wondered
   at that forgeries were the order of the day. And this was the case. We
   read even in the second century of numerous falsifications and
   interpolations made under their very eyes on the works of still living
   authors. Think of the grievances of the Church Fathers against the
   Gnostics, and the complaints of Dionysius of Corinth and Iren√¶us. But
   what did these often na√Øve and subjectively innocent falsifications
   signify compared with that spirit of lying which was powerfully at work
   even in official compositions in the third and fourth centuries? Read
   Rufinus' De adulterat. libr. Origenis, and weigh Rufinus' principles in
   translating the works of Origen. And the same spirit prevailed in the
   Church in the fifth and sixth centuries; see a collection of the means
   employed to deceive in my altchrist. Litt.-Gesch. I., p. xlii ff. In
   these centuries no one continued to put any trust in a documentary
   authority, a record of proceedings, or protocol. The letters by Bishops
   of this period throng with complaints of forgeries; the defeated party
   at a Synod almost regularly raises the charge that the acts of Synod
   are falsified; Cyril and the great letter-writers complain that their
   letters are circulated in a corrupt form; the epistles of dead
   Fathers--e.g., that of Athanasius to Epictetus--were falsified, and
   foreign matter was inserted into them; the followers of Apollinaris and
   Monophysites, e.g., systematically corrupted the tradition. See the
   investigations of Caspari and Dr√§seke. Conversely, the simplest method
   of defending an ancient Church Father who was cited by the opposition,
   or on whose orthodoxy suspicion was cast, was to say that the hereties
   had corrected his works to suit themselves and had sown weeds among his
   wheat. The official literature of the Nestorian and Monophysite
   controversy is a swamp of mendacity and knavery, above which only a few
   spots rise on which it is possible to find a firm footing. Gregory I.
   (Ep. VI. 14) at once recalls in a given case the forging of the acts of
   the Ephesian Synod. What was not published as Nicene in later times,
   and to some extent very soon! Much indeed was even then dismissed as
   mendacity and deceit, much has been laid bare by the scholars of the
   seventeenth century. But if one considers the verdicts, anxieties, and
   assertions of suspicion of contemporaries of those conflicts, he cannot
   avoid the fear that present-day historians are still much too confiding
   in dealing with this whole literature. The uncertainties which remain
   in the study precisely of the most important alterations of the history
   of dogma, and of the Church of the Byzantine period, necessarily awaken
   the suspicion that we are almost throughout more or less helpless in
   face of the systematically corrupted tradition. All the same I would
   not recommend so bold a handling of the sources as that formerly
   practised by the Jesuits, and to-day by Vincenzi (Ketzertaufstreit,
   Acten des 5 Concils, Honoriusfrage).

   Supplement 5.--The form assumed by the substance of the faith in the
   Greek Church shows very clearly the characteristic point of view.
   First, namely, it was conceived--though, so far as I know, seldom--as
   law; indeed Gregory of Nazianzus sketched a decalogue of faith. This
   form must not be misunderstood. The faith appears as law only in so far
   as its contents constitute a revealed ordinance of God to which man has
   to submit; we must not let it suggest to us a parallel to the moral
   law. Secondly, however, the creed is regarded in its formulas as a
   mystery to be kept secret. Men were initiated into the faith as they
   were initiated into the sacred rites. [382] Secrecy was, according to
   ancient ideas, the necessary nimbus of all consecration. The
   conceptions of the creed as law and as mystery have this in common,
   that in them the content of the faith appears as something strictly
   objective, something given from without. [383] But in so far as the
   authority of any formula whatever conflicts with original Christianity
   as much as this secrecy, the dependence of the Greek Church on the
   practice of the ancient mysteries and schools of philosophy is here
   manifest.

   Supplement 6.--Ideas of the realisation of the supreme good in the
   world beyond had to attach themselves to the phrases of the creed known
   in the Symbols, and were not permitted to disregard the numerous and
   diversified statements of Holy Scripture. The motley and manifold
   conceptions which resulted were owing to harmonising with primitive
   Christian eschatology on the one hand, and Origen's doctrine of the
   consummation on the other, subject to due regard for the sacred
   writings. Origen's doctrine was more and more regarded as heretical
   from the end of the fourth century, while previously recognised
   theologians, like Gregory of Nyssa, had reproduced it in all its main
   points. Its rejection marks the first decisive victory of
   traditionalism--itself indeed impregnated with speculation--over
   spiritualising speculation. In the fifth century, there were counted as
   heretical, (1) the doctrine of apokatastasis (universalism) and the
   possibility of redemption for the devil; [384] (2) the doctrine of the
   complete annihilation of evil; (3) the conception of the penalties of
   hell as tortures of conscience; (4) the spiritualising version of the
   resuscitation of the body; and (5) the idea of the continued creation
   of new worlds. On the other hand, the doctrines of Christ's reign on
   earth for a thousand years, and the double resurrection, etc., were in
   the East in part shelved, in part absolutely characterised as Jewish
   heresies. [385] The return of Christ, which was still described as
   imminent, though for many theologians it had lost its essential
   significance, the judgment of the world, the resurrection of the body,
   [386] the eternal misery (thanatos en athanasia--undying death) of the
   wicked, were maintained, and even the conception of a transfiguration
   of heaven and this earth was not everywhere rejected. Retained
   accordingly were only those points enumerated in the symbols, and
   therefore no longer to be passed over. To these were added the
   expectation of Antichrist, which, however, only emerged, as a rule,
   during exceptional distress, as in the times of Arian emperors, Julian,
   barbarous nations, Mohammed, etc., and by no means now belonged to the
   solid substance of theological eschatology; (yet see Cyril, Catech. 15,
   ch. 11 f., the pseudo-hippolytan work peri sunteleias, and the late
   apocalypses of from the fourth to the seventh century). Blessedness was
   regarded as a state of freedom from suffering, of the perfect
   knowledge, and the intuitive and entrancing enjoyment, of God. Yet the
   majority recognised different degrees and stages of blessedness, a
   conception in which we perceive the moralist encroach upon the ground
   of religion, [387] since it put a high value on special earthly
   achievements, such as asceticism and martyrdom. As regards the blessed
   dead, it was supposed in wide circles that their souls waited in Hades,
   a subterranean place, for the return of Christ; [388] there Christ had
   also preached the gospel to the good who had died before him. [389] Not
   a few Fathers of the fourth century maintained, following Origen, that
   the souls of the pious at once enter Paradise, or come to Christ, [390]
   and this opinion gained ground more and more. It was universal in
   regard to saints and martyrs. Besides, the conceptions of the
   intermediate state, like everything else in this connection, were
   altogether vague, since Greek theologians were only interested
   ultimately in the hope of deification. [391] In the West, on the
   contrary, the entire primitive Christian eschatology was upheld pretty
   nearly intact during the fourth century, and even the idea of Nero
   returning as Antichrist had numerous supporters. The reason of this
   lies in the fact that Neoplatonic speculation, and speculation
   generally, obtained at first no footing here, and the specific import
   of Christianity at the same time was still always expressed in the
   dramatically conceived eschatology. But the distinction between West
   and East goes at this point much deeper. Strongly eschatological as was
   the aim of the whole dogmatics of the East, it cannot be overlooked
   that the heart of the matter--the thought of the judgement--had been
   torn away from the eschatology since Origen. This thought which
   expresses the fearful responsibility of every soul to the God of
   holiness, and without which the forgiveness of sins must remain an
   enigma and an empty word, dominated the gospel, and determined ancient
   Christianity. But "scientific" theology had shelved it. [392] The name
   is not wanting in Origen's system, but the thing had disappeared. In
   spite of all the emphasis laid on freedom, nothing exists but a cosmic
   process, in which the many issues from the one, in order to return into
   the one. In such a scheme the Judgment has been deprived of its
   meaning. In subsequent times apokatastasis--universalism--was indeed
   condemned in the East, and Origen's system was rejected; but any one
   who studies closely Greek Byzantine dogmatics will see how profound was
   the attachment to this most important point in Origenism and
   Neoplatonism. The problems to which the creed gave birth in the fourth
   to the seventh century, and which men laboured to solve, discountenance
   any effective reference to the judgment. Again and again we have
   deification as a hyperphysical and therefore physical process, but
   dogmatics tell us little of the tenet that it is appointed unto man to
   die and after that the judgment. For this reason also the strict
   connection with morality was lost, and therefore in some regions even
   Islam was a deliverer. It was different in the West. What has been
   named the "Chiliasm" of the West, possessed its essential significance
   in the prospect of the judgment. If we compare West and East in the
   Middle Ages--the theologians, not the laity--no impression is stronger
   than that the former knew the fear of the judge to which the latter had
   become indifferent. It was the restless element in the life of faith of
   the West; it sustained the thought of forgiveness of sins; it
   accordingly made the reformation of Catholicism possible. And any
   reformation, if it should ever take place in the Greek Church, will
   begin by restoring the conviction of the responsibility of every
   individual soul, emphasising the judgment, and thus gaining the fixed
   point from which to cast down the walls of dogmatics.

   [373] It occurs, e.g., in the Homilies of Macarius. If elsewhere he
   speaks of charis, it is as a rule the substantial grace imparted in the
   sacraments (baptism) that is meant. The beginning of Cyril's first
   Catechism is very instructive: Kaines diathekes mathetai kai Christou
   musterion koinonoi, nun men te klesei, met' oligon de kai te chariti,
   kardian heautois poiesate kainen kai pneuma kainon, hina euphrosunes
   hupothesis genesthe tois ouranois.

   [374] See Cyril, Catech. 4, c. 2: Ho tes theosebeias tropos ek duo
   touton sunesteke, dogmaton eusebon kai praxeon agathon. Kai oute ta
   dogmata choris ergon agathon euprosdekta to Theo, oute ta me met'
   eusebon dogmaton erga teloumena prosdechetai ho Theos . . . megiston
   toinun ktema esti to ton dogmaton matheema.

   [375] Cyril begins his 18th Catechism with the words "The root of every
   good action is the hope of the resurrection. For the expectation of
   obtaining a corresponding reward is a spur to incite the soul to
   practise good works." The way to morality is made easy by removal of
   the fear of death.

   [376] Ed. Usener, l. c. Once more we have to compare Cyril of
   Jerusalem. After he has limited the "creed" to the ten sections of the
   Symbol he continues: meta de ten gnosin tes semnes kai endoxou tautes
   kai panagias pisteos kai seauton gnothi loipon hostis ei. Accordingly,
   faith is that given from without, divine. Moral self-knowledge and
   self-discipline are independent of it.

   [377] The Greek Fathers speak not infrequently of the new birth in
   connection with N. T. passages and it is to be admitted that some
   succeed in reproducing the thought satisfactorily, but only--so far as
   I know--when they adhere closely to the sacred texts. At all events we
   must not let ourselves be misled by the mere title. This is shown most
   clearly by the closing chapters of Gregory of Nyssa's Orat. catechet.
   (ch. 33 sq.). By regeneration Gregory understands the mysterious birth
   in us of the divine nature, which is implanted by baptism. As the
   natural man is born of moist seed, so the new undying man is born of
   water at the invocation of the Holy Trinity. The new immortal nature is
   thus begun in germ by baptism and is nourished by the Eucharist. That
   this conception has nothing in common with the new birth of the New
   Test., since it has a physical process in view, needs no proof.
   According to Cyril, regeneration only takes place after man has
   voluntarily left the service of sin (see Catech. I., ch. 2).

   [378] The fundamental conception of the nature of the blessing secured
   by salvation is yet not wholly unknown to rational theology, since the
   latter supposed, though with some uncertainty, that it could perceive a
   divine element in the original constitution of men (see, e.g., Gregory
   of Nyssa). Even for the doctrine of the Trinity recourse was had here
   and there to reason and the philosophers. But we must go still farther.
   If the doctrine of redemption has been characterised above as mystical,
   this does not exclude the fact that faith confers redemption in so far
   as it confers a knowledge which in and by itself includes liberation.
   As long as men dealt independently with dogma, this conception was by
   no means wanting; indeed it was really the hidden mystery in dogma
   which was clearly expressed by Clement and Origen, but only dimly
   shadowed by later teachers. From this point, however, faith and ethics
   were intimately combined; for ethics was also intellectual. No later
   writer has stated and known the thought so clearly expressed by Clement
   of Alex. (Strom. IV. 23, 149): Dioper ho Demokrito eu legei "hos he
   phusis te kai didache paraplesion esti" . . . kai gar he didache
   metarruthmizei ton anthropon, metarruthmizousa de phusiopoiei kai
   dienenken ouden e phusei plasthenai toionde e chrono kai mathesei
   metatupothenai; ampho de ho kurios pareschetai, to men kata ten
   demiourgian, to de kata ek tes diathekes anaktisin te kai ananeosin.
   The whole matter gradually became really mystical, i.e., indescribable
   and inconceivable in every sense in the Fathers; the intellectual phase
   and intention almost disappeared. Conversely, the reality of the
   blessing in salvation was thought of from the beginning as something
   supernatural, surprising, and bestowed from without.

   [379] One might be disposed to assume that the dogmatic of the ancient
   Church also contained articuli puri et mixti, but this designation
   would be misleading. In the opinion of the Fathers, the gospel must
   have made everything, clear; conversely, there is hardly anything in
   the dogmatics which able philosophers had not foreshadowed. The
   realisation was the mystery. Socrates says (H. E. III. 16): Polloi ton
   par' Hellesi philosophesanton ou makran tou gnonai ton Theon egenonto,
   kai gar kai pros tous apronoesian eisagontas, hoite Epikourious, e
   allos eristikous, meta tes logikes epistemes gennaios apentesan, ten
   amathian auton anatrepontes, kai dia touton ton logon chreiodeis men
   tois ten eusebeian agaposi katestesan; ou men tes kephales tou logou
   ekratesan, tou me gnonai to apokruptomenon apo ton geneon kai apo ton
   aionon kata Christon musterion; Socrates had already in view violent
   opponents of the intrusion of Ellenike paideia into theology; but the
   dispute so passionately conducted never really weakened the confidence
   placed in natural theology. The actual position is correctly described
   in Eusebius' phrase (H. E. IV. 7, 14): he kath' hemas epi theiois te
   kai philosophois dogmasi didaskalia.

   [380] Compare Gregory Nyss., Orat. catech. 5: To men einai logon Theou
   kai pneuma dia te ton koinon ennoion ho Hellen kai dia ton graphikon ho
   Ioudaios isos ouk antilexei, ten de kata ton anthropon oikonomian tou
   Theou logou kata to ison hekateros auton apodokimasei hos apithanon te
   kai aprepe peri Theou legesthai.

   [381] The plan of Cyril's catechisms is very instructive. First, there
   is in the preface an inquiry as to the aim and nature of the
   instruction. It begins with the words Ede makariotetos osae pros humas.
   Compare also ch. VI: Blepe moi peliken soi axian ho Iesous charizetai
   . . . me nomises hoti mikron pragma lambaneis; anthropos on oiktros,
   Theou lambaneis prosegorian . . . touto problepon ho Psalmodos elegen
   ek prosopou tou Theou, epeide mellousin anthropoi Theou prosegorian
   lambanein; Ego eipa, theoi este kai huioi hupsistou pantes, c. 12: ean
   se katechoumenos exetase, ti eirekasin hoi didaskontes, meden lege to
   exo; musterion gar soi paradidomen kai elpida mellontos aionos; tereson
   to musterion to misthapodote. Then follow three Catechisms which impart
   information concerning sin, baptism, and penitence in general, and are
   meant to awaken the right disposition. In the fourth a sketch is given
   of the system of faith according to the Symbol. Ten systems are
   distinguished, whose numbering, however, can no longer be established
   with certainty. The exposition contained in Catechisms 5-18 do not
   agree with the sketch, seeing that to the latter is appended a didactic
   section on the soul, the body, food, and clothing, a section which is
   wanting in the exposition; the latter rather in the last catechism
   deals with the Church, which is not mentioned in the sketch. The whole
   is concluded by five catechisms which explain the secret rites of the
   mysteries to the baptised. The decalogue of the faith by Gregory
   contains, in the first commandment, the doctrine of the Trinity; in the
   second, the creation out of nothing and the providence of God; in the
   third, the origin of evil from freedom, not from an evil matter or God;
   in the fourth, the doctrine of the incarnation and constitution of the
   Redeemer; in the fifth, the crucifixion and burial; in the sixth, the
   resurrection and ascension; in the seventh, the return of Christ in
   glory to act as judge; in the eight and ninth, the general resurrection
   and retributive judgment; the tenth runs: Dekaton ergazou to agathon
   epi touto to themelio ton dogmaton, epeide pistis choris ergon nekra,
   hos erga dicha pisteos.

   [382] See the investigations into the so-called Arcan-Disciplin, by
   Rothe, Th. Harnack, Bonwetsch, and Von Zezschwitz.

   [383] Constantine delighted in applying the name "law" to the whole of
   the Christian religion. This is western (nostra lex = nostra religio);
   it is rare in the East. On the other hand, the whole Bible was not
   infrequently "the law" in the one Church as well as in the other.

   [384] Gregory of Nyssa still defended it, appealing to 1 Cor. XV. 28;
   see the second half of his writing peri psuches kai anastaseos, and
   Orat. catech. 8, 35. So also--for a time--Jerome and the older
   Antiochenes; even in the fifth century it had numerous defenders in
   both East and West. It was definitively condemned with the condemnation
   of Origen under Justinian. See under, ch. XI.

   [385] The last important theological representative of Chiliasm in the
   East was Apollinaris of Laodicea; see Epiph. H. 77, ch. 37, Jerome de
   vir. inl. 18. Jerome labours to prove (Ep.129) that the terra
   promissionis was not Palestine, but a heavenly place. The Apocalypse
   was, as a rule, not included in the Canon in the East (in older times).
   With this state of matters is contrasted very strongly the fact that in
   the lower ranks of priests, monks, and laity apocalypses continued to
   be eagerly read, and new ones were ever being produced on the basis of
   the old.

   [386] The doctrine of the resurrection of man in spirit and body still
   always formed a main point in Apologetic evidences, and was, as
   formerly, proved from the omnipotence of God, from various analogical
   inferences, and from the essential importance of the body for human
   personality. The Cappadocians and some later Greek theologians still
   held, though in a much weakened form, to the spiritualistic version of
   the doctrine attempted by Origen. But, following Methodius, Epiphanius
   (H. 64, ch. 12 ff.) especially insisted that there was the most perfect
   identity between the resurrection body and our material body, and this
   faith, enforced in the West by Jerome, soon established itself as alone
   orthodox. There now arose many problems concerning the limbs and
   members of the future body, and even Augustine seriously considered
   these. He experimented on the flesh of a peacock, and confirmed his
   faith in the resurrection by the discovery of its preservation from
   decay.

   [387] The assumption of various degrees of blessedness (and damnation)
   must have been almost universal; for the divergent opinion of Jovinian
   was felt to be heretical; see Jerome adv. Jovin. I. 3, II. 18-34. Still
   it excited more real interest in the West than in the East (Augustine,
   De civitate, XXII., ch. 30). As regards the idea of future existence,
   some Fathers supposed that men would positively become angels, others
   that they would be like the angels.

   [388] The different conceptions as to the relations of Hades, Hell,
   Paradise, the bosom of Abraham, etc., do not come in here. According to
   Gregory of Nyssa, Hades is not to be held a place, but an invisible and
   incorporeal state of the life of the soul.

   [389] This old theologoumenon (see Vol. I., p. 203) occurs in western
   and eastern theologians. Those who would have become Christians if they
   had lived later, i.e., after Christ's appearance, were redeemed. The
   phrase descendit ad inferna came into the Symbols from the fourth
   century. We find it in the West first, in the Symbol of Aquileia, in
   the East in the formula of the fourth Synod at Sirmium (359 eis ta
   katachthonia katelthonta). It is at least questionable whether it was
   already in the Jerusalemite Symbol at the same date. Compare Hahn,
   Bibliothek d. Symbole, 2 Aufl. ¬ß¬ß 24, 27, 34, 36, 37, 39-41, 43, 45,
   46-60, 93, 94, 96, 108; Caspari, Ueber das Jerus. Taufbekenntniss in
   Cyrillus' Katechesen, with an excursus: Hat das Jerus. Taufbekenntniss
   den descensus ad inferos enthalten, in the norweg. Theol. Ztschr. Vol.
   I.

   [390] With this it could be and, as a rule, was understood that their
   felicity up to the last judgment was only preliminary. Two interests
   met here: those of a spiritualising religion and of primitive Christian
   eschatology; see Vol. I., p. 129 f. The latter required that
   blessedness should be attached to the return of Christ and the last
   judgment; the former demanded that it should be complete as soon as the
   believing soul had parted from the mortal body. Therefore, in spite of
   Jerome's polemic against Vigilantius and Augustine's against Pelagius,
   no fixed Church doctrine could be arrived at here, however much piety
   desired an absolute decision. See for details Petavius and Schwane D.
   Gesch. d. patrist Zeit, p. 749 ff.

   [391] Clement and Origen had assumed a purgatory in the shape of a
   cleansing fire (see Vol. II., p. 377, n. 5); the Greek Fathers,
   however, have, so far as I know, dropped the idea, with the exception
   of Gregory of Nyssa (peri` psuches kai` anasta'seos, Oehler, Vol. I.,
   p. 98 f.). From Origen and Gregory the conception passed to Ambrose who
   established it in the West, after the way had been prepared for it by
   Tertullian. The Scriptural proof was 1 Cor. III. 13 f.; compare
   Augustine De civitate dei, XXI. 23 sq. Enchir. 68 sq. (ignis
   purgatorius).

   [392] It still lived in the popular views of Christianity held by the
   Orientals.

CHAPTER III.

  SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE AND AUTHORITIES; OR, SCRIPTURE, TRADITION, AND THE
  CHURCH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The extent and authority of the Catholic authorities were already
   substantially fixed at the beginning of the fourth century, though
   their mutual relations and the manner of using them in detail were not.
   [393] Among the parties which contended over the correct definition of
   the dogma of redemption, they had to a certain degree become
   undoubtedly subjects of controversy. The great opposition between a
   more liberal theology and pure traditionalism was based upon a
   difference in the way of looking at the authorities. But this
   opposition never culminated in a clear contrast of principles.
   Consequently, theologians had no occasion to frame a special doctrine
   of the Church and the authorities--Scripture and tradition. The need
   was not, as in the case of the dogma of redemption, so pressing as to
   lead men to adopt the perilous and obnoxious course of formulating laws
   of faith anew. The petty skirmishes, however, with more or less obscure
   theologians and reformers, who point-blank objected to this or that
   portion of the traditional basis, did not come before the great
   tribunal of the Church, and the conflict with Manich√¶ans, Paulicians,
   Euchites, and Bogomilians, has left no trace in the history of dogma.
   [394]

   Still, changes took place in the period between Eusebius and Johannes
   Damascenus. They followed simply the altered requirements of the
   Church. They gave utterance to the increased traditionalism. Necessity
   became a virtue, i.e., every new point which was felt to be needed in
   order to preserve the unity of the Church, or to adapt its institutions
   to the taste of the time, was inserted in the list of authorities. This
   method was in vogue even in the third century. It was now only further
   and further extended. But it is hard to fix its results, since at that
   time there was no fixity and there could be none, from the nature of
   the principle that the state of the Church at any time was to be
   declared as in every respect the traditional one. [395]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [393] See the account given in Vol. II., pp. 18-127, and elsewhere.

   [394] The opposition to the Eustathians and Andians (see the Acts of
   the Synod of Gangra and Epiph. H.70) does not belong to this section;
   for it arose from a different conception of the obligatoriness of the
   monk's life on Christians. On the contrary, it is noteworthy that
   A√´rius, once a friend of Eustathius (Epiph. H.75) not only maintained
   the original identity of bishops and presbyters--that had also been
   done, and supported from the N. T., by Jerome and the theologians of
   Antioch--but he made the question an articulus stantis et cadentis
   ecclesi√¶. We cannot now determine what motive influenced him. The
   attack of Marcellus of Ancyra on the foundations of the prevalent
   theology, and his argument that the dogma was essentially anthropines
   boules te kai gnomes, are of incomparably greater significance in
   principle. But his arguments were not understood, and produced no
   effect. Meanwhile, the basis of the whole structure of the Catholic
   Church in the East was at no time left unassailed. The Church has never
   embraced everything which was, and might be, named Christian. After the
   Marcionites and the older sects had retired from the stage, or had
   fused with the Manich√¶ans, Paulicians, Euchites, and Bogomilians, etc.,
   came upon the scene. These Churches contested the Catholic foundations
   as the Marcionites and Manich√¶ans had done; they accepted neither the
   Catholic Canon, nor the hierarchical order and tradition. They
   succeeded, in part, in creating lasting, comprehensive, and exclusive
   systems, and afforded work to Byzantine theologians and politicians for
   centuries. But important as it is to assert their existence, they have
   no place in the history of dogma; for at no time had they any influence
   whatever on the formation of dogma in the East; they have left no
   effect on the Church. Therefore general Church history has alone to
   deal with them.

   [395] The view held of the apostolate of the twelve first fully reached
   its Catholic level in the fourth and fifth centuries. The Apostles were
   (1) missionaries who had traversed the whole world and performed
   unheard of miracles, (2) the rulers of the Churches, (3) teachers and
   law-givers in succession to Christ, having given in speech and writing
   to the least detail all the regulations necessary to the Church for
   faith and morals, (4) the authors of the order of worship, the liturgy,
   (5) heroic ascetics and fathers of monachism, (6) though hesitatingly,
   the mediators of salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. Holy Scripture. [396]

   To the two Testaments a unique authority was ascribed. They were the
   Holy Scriptures kat' exochen; every doctrine had to be proved out of
   them, in other words, opinions that held something necessary to faith
   which did not occur in Scripture, had no absolute validity. Any one who
   declared that he took his stand on Scripture alone did not assume an
   uncatholic attitude. This view of the Holy Scriptures presupposed that
   their extent was strictly defined, and placed beyond all doubt. But
   this supposition was for centuries contradicted by the actual facts,
   which, however, were concealed, partly because men neither would nor
   dared look at them, partly because they really did not see them. The
   theologians of Antioch, and especially Theodore, criticised on internal
   and external grounds the contents of the Canon, as these were gradually
   being fixed; but in doing so even they were guided by an ecclesiastical
   tradition. Their criticism still had its supporters in the sixth
   century, and its influence extended not only to Persia, but even,
   through Junilius, to the West. But neither the spirit of the criticism
   nor its results ever made any impression whatever on the great Church.
   [397]

   As regards the O. T., the oldest and most revered of the Greek Fathers
   followed Melito and Origen, and only recognised the 22-24 books of the
   Hebrew Canon, [398] according to the others in the Alexandrian Canon
   only a secondary validity, or none at all. While there was some
   hesitation about the Book of Esther, and that not only in Antioch, this
   decision obtained in the Greek Churches, though divergences were not
   wanting in provincial communities. But it was always in danger of being
   disregarded, for the sacred books were continually transcribed from the
   LXX.; and so, as a rule, those writings, excluded in theory, were
   copied along with the others. The legend of the genesis of the LXX.,
   again, was always highly valued, and it seemed to imply the sacredness
   of the whole translation. Yet it was only in consequence of the
   attempts at union with the Roman Church in the Middle Ages, and still
   more after the ill-fated enterprise of Cyrillus Lucaris (17th century),
   that the Greek Church was persuaded to give up the Hebrew and adopt the
   Alexandrian and Roman Canon. But a binding, official declaration never
   followed; the passiveness and thoughtlessness with which it changed, or
   upturned its position in so important a question, is extraordinarily
   characteristic of the modern Gr√¶co-Slavic Church. The question is not
   even yet decided, and there are distinguished Russian theologians, who
   regard the books of the Hebrew Canon as being alone strictly canonical.
   They are, however, growing ever fewer. [399] In the Western Church a
   state of complete uncertainty still prevailed in the fourth century as
   to the extent of the O. T. But the Latin Bible, complete copies of
   which may not have been very common, was a translation of the LXX. This
   fact was more potent than the historical views which found their way
   into the West from the East, in a disjointed form, and for whose
   triumph Jerome had laboured. Augustine, who was ignorant of Biblical
   criticism, held to the current Latin collection (see, e.g., his list in
   De doct. christ. II., 8), and at the Synods of Hippo, A.D. 393 (can.
   36), and Carthage, A.D. 397 (can. 47), the Alexandrian Canon was
   adopted. The decision that the Roman Church was to be asked for a
   confirmation of this conclusion does not seem to have been carried out.
   From that date the Hebrew Canon was departed from in the West, though
   the view of Athanasius, conveyed to it by Rufinus, and the decision of
   Jerome, exerted a quiet influence, and even apart from this some
   uncertainty--e.g., in the case of 4 Esra, the Pastor of Hermas,
   etc.,--still remained. [400] Cassiodorus seems to have taken a very
   important part in finally shaping the Latin Bible. But we cannot by any
   means describe the attitude of the West as uncritical. It only avoided
   the inconsistency into which scholars had fallen in extolling the LXX.
   as a divinely composed and authentic work, while they ranked the Hebrew
   Bible above it.

   As regards the N. T., the Alexandrian Church accepted the Western
   collection in the time of Origen, and in the course of the third
   century most of the others, though not yet all, [401] seem to have
   followed its example. In so far as any reflection was given to their
   historical characteristics, the Scriptures were regarded as
   Apostolic-catholic, and were acknowledged to contain the real sources
   of evidence for Christian doctrine. But the principle of apostolicity
   could not be strictly carried out. In many national Churches apostolic
   writings were known and revered which were not found in the Western
   collection, and conversely, it was not always possible to perceive the
   Apostolic origin and Catholic recognition of a received book. Origen
   already therefore adopted the idea, consonant to the spirit of
   antiquity, that the collection embraced those books about whose title a
   general agreement had prevailed from the earliest times. Canonicity was
   decided by unanimous testimony. But even this principle did not meet
   the whole case; Origen himself violated it in forming the group of
   seven Catholic Epistles. Yet it became the established rule, and put an
   end to any consideration of the question based on criticism of the
   facts. Eusebius, who was a very important authority, and who--if we are
   to understand the passage so--had been commissioned by the Emperor to
   prepare standard Bibles, followed the view of Origen; yet in the case
   of one book, the Apocalypse, he expressed his dislike in a way that ran
   counter to the principle of the Canon. The three, or four, categories,
   in which he required to arrange the books, show that men were
   struggling with a difficulty not to be solved in this way, which could
   only be solved by time with its power to hallow all inconsistencies.
   [402] If we collected statistically all the Eastern information we
   possess concerning the extent of the N. T. from the date of Eusebius up
   to the destruction of Constantinople--direct and indirect statements by
   Church Fathers, Synodal decisions, Bible manuscripts and indices from
   the Churches of various provinces, and especially Syria--we would be
   forced to the conclusion that complete confusion and uncertainty
   prevailed. [403] But this view would be erroneous. We have to multiply
   by hundreds the lists which enumerate 26 (27) books, i.e., the
   Acknowledged and the Disputed melioris not√¶ of Eusebius.--Athanasius'
   Festival Epistle, A.D. 367, was of paramount importance in settling the
   complete equality of these two classes in the Patriarchates of
   Alexandria and Constantinople and in the West.--On the other hand,
   apart from the Syrian Churches, [404] the lists which diverge from the
   above owe their existence either to a badly applied scholarship, or to
   individual reminiscences, in rare cases to a divergent usage on the
   part of provincial Churches. From the end of the fourth century real
   unanimity prevailed, in the main, as to the contents of the N. T. and
   the authorship of the separate books, in Constantinople, Asia Minor,
   Alexandria, and the West. Apart from doubts of long standing, yet
   ineffectual and isolated, about the Catholic Epistles (and Philemon?),
   the one exception was John's Revelation, for which Eusebius' verdict
   was momentous. [405] But even in this case attempts to come to a
   decision were given up: the book was shelved, and reemerged, from the
   circles in which it had maintained its ground, without exciting any
   controversy worth mentioning. The disquieting distinction between
   Acknowledged and Disputed books, abolished by Athanasius, was but very
   seldom of any consequence in practice; but scholars still recalled it
   here and there. When the collection was limited to 26 (27) books, the
   reading of others in the Church was, from the end of the fourth
   century, more strictly prohibited. But even at the beginning of the
   fifth, men in a position to know, like Jerome and Sozomen, can tell us
   that the prohibition was here and there unknown or disregarded. Some
   primitive Christian writings were thus in use in the Churches down to
   the fifth century and later; but the Monophysite Churches preserved, as
   a monkish protest against the spiritualism of Origen, Jewish
   Apocalypses revised by Christians and belonging to the earliest period,
   and the barbarism into which they fell spread a protective covering
   over these writings. [406]

   The details are obscure of the way in which the Western Church obtained
   the Epistle of James, second Peter, and third John. The Epistle to the
   Hebrews, not unknown to it from the first, it received in the fourth
   century as a Pauline composition, from the East, through the famous
   intermediaries. Those same men did away with all uncertainty at the
   close of the fourth century on the ground of the decisions given by
   Eusebius and Athanasius. The 27 books, i.e., the Canon of Athanasius,
   were alone recognised at the Synods of Hippo and Carthage (397), and
   this result was confirmed by Augustine's authority (see, e.g., De
   doctr. christ. II. 8) without any general declaration having been made.
   [407] But the sharper the line drawn between the collection and all
   other writings, the more suspicious must those have appeared whose
   title could lead, or had once admittedly led, to a claim for
   recognition as Catholic and Apostolic. The category of "apocryphal" in
   which they had formerly been placed, solely in order to mark the
   alleged or real absence of general testimony in their favour, now
   obtained more and more an additional meaning; they were of unknown
   origin, or fabricated', and this was often supplemented by the charge
   of being heretical'. But however great the gulf between the canonical
   and uncanonical books, it is impossible to conceal the fact that the
   Church never published a general decision, excluding all doubt, on the
   extent of the Canon in ancient times. The Canon of Augustine was
   adopted by Pope Innocent I. (Ep. 6, ch. 7, ad Exsuperium).

   With the complete elaboration of the conception of canonical books,
   every other description applied to them gave way to the idea of their
   divinity. [408] What could any predicate signify compared with the
   conviction that they had been composed by the Holy Ghost himself?
   Therefore the categories of canonical and inspired writings coincided,
   nay, inspiration in its highest sense was limited to the canonical
   books. The belief in inspiration was necessarily attended by the duty
   of pneumatic or allegorical exegesis. This sacred art was then
   practised by all, who were able thus to disregard the results of any
   other kind of exposition. The problems which pneumatic exegesis,
   praised even by cultured Hellenists, [409] had to solve, were mainly
   the following. It had (1) to demonstrate the agreement between the two
   Testaments, in other words; to christianise the O. T. completely, to
   discover prophecy everywhere, to get rid of the literal meaning where
   it was obnoxious, and to repel Jewish claims; [410] (2) to harmonise
   the statements of Holy Scripture with the prevailing dogmatics; (3) to
   furnish every text with a profound meaning, one valuable for the time.
   Exegesis became a kind of black art, and Augustine was not the only man
   who was delivered from Manich√¶an, by Biblical, Alchemy.

   But while these tasks were generally fixed, a sure and unvarying method
   was still wanting. [411] Even the principles of Origen were not
   strictly retained. [412] On the other hand, the historical antiquarian
   interest, which he had awakened, in Holy Scripture, continued to exert
   its influence. It not only lasted up to the fifth century, [413] but it
   also exerted a critical and restrictive influence on pneumatic exegesis
   [414] This was the case among the scholars of Antioch. Diodorus and
   Theodore tried, following the precedent set by Lucian and Dorotheus, to
   form an inner connection between the pneumatic and the
   grammatico-historical exegesis. It cannot be held that this gave rise
   to a more rational method, or one more tenable from the critical
   standpoint. Yet in detail they followed sound principles. These again
   had been already pared down by Chrysostom and Theodoret in favour of
   the dominant method, but they lasted in the Nestorian Church and its
   schools as long as science existed there at all, and their influence
   extended into the West through Junilius. [415]

   The West received through Hilary, Ambrose, Jerome, and Rufinus, the
   erudite pneumatic method of the Greeks, as practised especially by the
   Cappadocians. Before this, and for a few decades afterwards, the
   exegesis of the West was mainly characterised by absence of system;
   along with reverence for the letter we find all sorts of allegorical
   explanations, and in turn a predilection for a dramatic close to
   earthly history. Jerome was far from having fixed exegetic principles,
   since he allegorised against his better knowledge wherever the orthodox
   confession required it. In his time Tychonius, a Donatist, drew up for
   the interpretation of Holy Scripture seven rules which were to remove
   all difficulties (Augustine, De doctr. christ. III. 30 sq.). [416]
   These were adopted by Augustine in his work On Christian Science',
   which, subject as it is to the errors of the age, is a glorious
   memorial of the great Bishop's love of truth, and evangelical feeling.
   Of evangelical feeling, in so far as Augustine, in opposition to all
   biblicism, declared the study of Holy Scripture to be merely the path
   towards love; he who possessed love, no longer needed the Scripture, he
   lived with Christ and God; accordingly he had ceased to require
   separate saving truths', for he lived in truth and love. [417]

   But this thought of the book does not give its prevailing colour; this
   is furnished, on the contrary, by the other ideas that Scripture is the
   only way by which to come to God and Christ, that it is to be
   interpreted by the rule of faith, that obscure passages are to be
   explained by clear ones, and that the literal meaning, where offensive,
   must yield to the deeper sense. The numerous hermeneutic rules set up
   by Augustine, [418] which are so many expedients and very like Origen's
   methodic principles, determined the nature of exegesis in later periods
   in the West. In connection with whatever else was derived from the
   East, the view that there was a triple and fourfold meaning in
   Scripture became a fixed doctrine. [419] The little book by Junilius
   which contained the Antiochene system of hermeneutics as handed down at
   Nisibis, although much read, made few changes. But it was exceedingly
   significant that Augustine, in spite of his view that it was only a
   means, had placed the Bible on such a pinnacle that all theologians who
   afterwards took their stand upon it alone as against tradition, were
   able to appeal to him. As a matter of fact Scripture held quite a
   different place in the Church life of the West from that in the East:
   it came more into the foreground. That also is to be explained, above
   all, by the influence of Augustine, [420] and the deficiency of the
   West in speculative ability. [421]

   As the Church had never published a general decree, exclusive of all
   doubt, on the extent of Scripture, it had also failed to publish one
   concerning its characteristics. Freedom from error was generally
   deduced from inspiration, and it was, as a rule, referred to the very
   words. But on the other hand, an attempt was made here and there to
   leave room for the individuality and historical limitation of the
   authors; minor inconsistencies were not wholly denied (see even Aug.,
   De consensu evang.); and exegesis was often practised as if the strict
   dogma of inspiration did not exist. [422] A clear idea of the
   sufficiency of Scripture was certainly not reached; it was maintained
   in general phrases, and was violated in generalities and in details.
   [423] Finally, as regards the relation of the two Testaments to each
   other, three views existed side by side. The Old Testament was a
   Christian book as well as the New: it was throughout the record of
   prophecy: it contained the true creed under certain limitations and
   imperfections, and led and still leads educationally to Christ. These
   points of view were adopted alternately as the occasion required. It
   was recognised that the Jewish nation had possessed a covenant with
   God, yet the consequences of this were far from being admitted. The
   same method of employing the Bible was still upheld in apologetic
   arguments as was followed by the Apologists of the second century.
   [424] For the rest, even Cyril of Alexandria still brought "heathen
   prophecy" to bear in this matter, while in other respects--speaking
   generally--the assumption of heathen prophets' and inspired
   philosophers excited suspicion.

   [396] See histories of the Canon by Holtzmann, Schmiedel (in Ersch and
   Gruber "Kanon"); Weiss, Westcott, and especially Zahn. Overbeck, Z.
   Gesch. des Kanons, 1880. The controversy with the Jews as to the
   possession and exposition of the O. T. still continued in the Byzantine
   period; see on this McGiffert, Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew,
   entitled Antibole Papiskou kai Philonos k.t.l. . . . together with a
   discussion of Christian polemics against the Jews. New York, 1889.

   [397] On the attitude of Theodore and his disciples to the Canon, see
   the thorough investigations of Kihn (Theodorus von Mopsuestia und
   Junilius Africanus, 1880). Theodore rejected from the O. T., Job, the
   Song of Songs, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Esther, and the
   inscriptions of the Psalms; see Leontius Byz. Contra Nestor. et Eutych.
   L. III., ch. 13-17, Migne T. 86, p. 1365 sq. The fifth Synod expressly
   condemned Theodore's criticism and interpretation of Job and the Song
   of Songs, as well as his idea of inspiration in reference to Solomon's
   writings, and his exposition of some of the Psalms. On Theodore's
   prestige in Nisibis, see Kihn, p. 333 f.; on Junilius' dependence on
   him, l. c., 350-382. For the dependence of the Nestorian Canon on
   Theodore's, see Noeldeke in the G√∂tt. Gel. Anz. 1868, St. 46, p. 1826
   and Kihn, l. c., 336.

   [398] Authoritative were especially the views of Athanasius, Cyril of
   Jerus. and Gregory of Nazianzus, who reckoned only 22 Books; see also
   the sixtieth Canon of the Council of Laodicea (363? inauthentic?).

   [399] See Gass, Symbolik der griechischen Kirche, p. 97 ff.; Strack,
   Kanon des A. T. in Prot. R.-E., Vol. VII. 2, p. 412 ff. The reader is
   referred to this article and to Introductions to the O. T. for details.
   Kattenbusch, Confessionskunde I., p. 292.

   [400] Gregory I. (Moral XIX. 13) thought it necessary to excuse himself
   for arguing from Maccabees.

   [401] Thus Syrian Churches still used Tatian's Diatessaron in the
   fourth century; and in a few circles among them there were retained in
   the Canon, the apocryphal correspondence of the Corinthians and Paul,
   the two Epp. of Clement, nay, even the Ep. of Clement de virginitate.
   On the other hand, some books were wanting. Not a few apocryphal
   writings held an undefined rank in the Syrian Patriarchate. In a word,
   the old Roman Canon, expanded in the course of the third century in
   Alexandria, did not get the length of being acknowledged in vast
   territories of the East proper. In spite of the association of the
   Apostolic Epistles with the Gospels, the higher rank peculiar to the
   latter was not done away with as late as the fourth century. Alexander
   of Alexandria (in Theodoret H. E. I. 4) describes the contents of Holy
   Scripture briefly as Law, Prophets, and Gospels.'

   [402] On the efforts of Eusebius to fix the extent of the N. T., see
   Texte und Untersuch. zur altchristl. Litteratur-Geschichte, Vol. II. 1,
   2, p. 5 ff.

   [403] Almost everything which was esteemed in quite different
   circumstances in the earliest period, is to be again found somewhere or
   other in the Byzantine age. Most instructive is the history of
   Clement's Epistles and Hermas. Conversely, the old doubts also remain
   and even new ones emerge (Philemon, see Jerome in his preface to the
   Epistle).

   [404] The N. T. had a peculiar history in the Syrian Churches, which
   has not yet been written; see Nestle, Syrische Bibel√ºbersetzungen' in
   the Prot. R.-E. Vol. XV.; B√§thgen's work on the Syrus Cureton. 1885,
   and my das N. T. um das Jahr 200' ( 1888). It is more than questionable
   whether Theodore of Mopsuestia did any independent criticism on the
   extent of the N. T. He, probably, simply adhered to the Canon of his
   Church, which then of the Catholic Epistles only admitted 1 Peter and 1
   John, and rejected the Apocalypse; see Kihn, l. c., 65 ff. and the
   Canon of Chrysostom. While the whole Church was substantially agreed
   about the extent of the N. T., from the end of the fourth century, wide
   districts in the Patriarchate of Antioch retained their separate
   traditions. Only we must not forget that the vast majority even of
   these had accepted the Roman Canon of undisputed books in the second
   half of the third century. But the agreement went no further; for from
   the fourth century they would take no more instruction from Alexandria.

   [405] For the rest, Weiss has rightly shown (Einleitung in das N. T.,
   p. 98) that the extent to which the Apocalypse was rejected, has been
   somewhat exaggerated. Extremely noteworthy is the view of Didymus on 2
   Peter (Enarrat. in epp. cathol.): "Non est ignorandum pr√¶sentem
   epistolam esse falsatam, qu√¶ licet publicetur non tamen in canone est."

   [406] In the Byzantine Church also Apocalypses continued to be read,
   and new ones were constantly being produced.

   [407] See also under this head the verdict, freer because dependent on
   Theodore, which Junilius passed on the Catholic Epistles. Critical
   investigations have not yet arrived at a final result regarding the
   Decretum Gelasii. Augustine himself has not failed, besides, to notice
   the doubts that existed in his time; see Retractat. II. 4, 2. In his De
   pecc. mer. I. 27, he still leaves the Ep. to the Hebrews unassigned. In
   De doctr. christ. II. 8, he writes: "In canonicis autem scripturis
   ecclesiarum catholicarum quam plurimum auctoritatem sequatur, inter
   quas sane ill√¶ sint, qu√¶ apostolicas sedes habere et epistolas accipere
   meruerunt." Accordingly, this principle still holds. "Tenebit igitur
   hunc modum in scripturis canonicis, ut eas qu√¶ ab omnibus accipiuntur
   ecclesiis catholicis, pr√¶ponat eis quas qu√¶dam non accipiunt; in iis
   vero qu√¶ non accipiuntur ab omnibus, pr√¶ponat eas, quas plures
   gravioresque accipiunt eis, quas pauciores minorisque auctoritatis
   ecclesi√¶ tenent. Si autem alias invenerit a pluribus, alias a
   gravioribus haberi, quamquam hoc facile inveniri non possit, √¶qualis
   tamen auctoritatis eas habendas puto." Since the older copies of the
   Bible continued to be transcribed, uniformity had not been secured. It
   is true we no longer possess western Bibles whose contents are limited
   to the earliest Roman Canon--Gospels, Acts, 13 Pauline Ep., 1 and 2
   John, 1 Peter, Jude, Revelation--but we have them with an Ep. to the
   Laodiceans, the Pastor (though in the O. T.), and even with the
   apocryphal correspondence of the Corinthians and Paul.

   [408] The conception that the canonical books were solemnly set apart,
   occurs first in Athanasius; the Alexandrians, however, including
   Origen, had the idea and even the word before him (Orig. Prolog. in
   Cantic.). Athanasius writes in his Festival Ep. ta kanonizomena kai
   paradothenta pisteuthenta te theia einai biblia.

   [409] The Neoplatonic opponents of the Church were not quite honest,
   they were rather talking dialektikos, when they objected to the
   allegorical method of interpreting Holy Scripture. They treated their
   own sacred writings in exactly the same way.

   [410] Sozomen says (H. E. V.22) that the Jews were more readily seduced
   to heathenism, because they only interpreted Holy Scripture pros
   rheton, and not pros theorian.

   [411] Thus Arians and Orthodox sometimes appealed to the same texts.
   But the impossibility of drawing up a rule deciding how far the letter
   of Scripture was authoritative, caused more anxiety. Had God a human
   form, eyes, or voice; was Paradise situated on the earth; did the dead
   rise with all their bodily members, even with their hair, etc.?--to all
   these and a hundred similar questions there was no sure answer, and
   consequently disputes arose between adherents of one and the same
   confession. All had to allegorise, and, in turn, all had to take
   certain texts literally. But what a difference existed between an
   Epiphanius and a Gregory of Nyssa, and how many shades of belief there
   were between the crude anthropomorphists and the spiritualists! The
   latter, as a rule, had reason to dread the arguments, and frequently
   the fists, of the former; they could not but be anxious about their own
   orthodoxy, for the old regula was on the side of their opponents, and
   the most absurd opinion had the prejudice that it was the most pious in
   its favour. Ultimately, in the course of the fifth century, a sort of
   common sense established itself, which could be taken as forming, with
   regard to the anthropomorphists, a middle line between the exegetic
   methods of Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria, and which had been
   anticipated by a few Fathers of the fourth century. Yet not many
   concessions were made to the anthropomorphists. Even Antiochians like
   Theodore had become suspected of an anthropomorphism incompatible with
   the honour of God (see Johannes Philoponus, De creat. mundi, I. 22. in
   Gallandi XII., p. 496). He who did not rise from the turpitudo litter√¶
   ad decorem intelligenti√¶ spiritalis (Jerome ad Amos. 2) might come
   under suspicion of heresy. But, on the other hand, the Cappadocians
   themselves opposed those who allegorised "too much", and thus
   approximated too closely to heathen philosophers; and after a part of
   Origen's expositions had passed into the traditional possessions of the
   Church, the rest was declared heretical. Even before this Epiphanius
   had written (H. 61, ch. 6): Panta ta theia rhemata ouk allegorias
   deitai, alla hos echei, echei, theorias de deitai kai aistheseos.
   Origen's thorough-going principle that "God can say and do nothing,
   which is not good and just", by which he criticised and occasionally
   set aside the letter of Scripture, was too bold for the Epigoni with
   their faith in authority. God had done what Scripture said of him, and
   what God did was good. This principle not only ruined all lucid
   science, but also deprived the Church of the intrinsic completeness of
   her creed. Yet we must not minimise the result of the compromise made
   in the fourth and fifth centuries, between the literal, allegorical,
   and typical methods of interpreting Scripture; for it has held its
   ground up to the present day in a way really identical in all Churches,
   and it seems to possess no small power to convince.

   [412] For Origen's principles see Vol. II., p. 346.

   [413] Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome are links in a chain of scholarly
   tradition and work. The succession, however, marked a descent not only
   in point of time. The attitude of Jerome and the conflicts in which he
   was involved show at the same time that the age no longer tolerated
   independent scholarship in historical criticism. Therefore it ceased
   after Jerome; such work was confined to registering antiquarian
   notices, even doubtful ones, which were accepted without reflection,
   since, having entered into the stock of tradition, they no longer
   roused criticism.

   [414] Besides, when driven by necessity, i.e., when brought face to
   face with inconvenient passages of Scripture, a way was found out of
   the difficulty in the demand that the historical occasion of the text
   must be carefully weighed. Thus Athanasius writes (Orat. c. Arian. I.
   54), when setting himself to refute the Scriptural proofs of the
   Arians, and finding that he is in considerable straits: dei de, hos epi
   pases theias graphes prosekei poiein kai anankaion estin, houto kai
   entautha, kath' hon eipen ho apostolos kairon kai to prosopon kai to
   pragma, dioper egrapse, pistos eklambanein, hina me para tauta e kai
   par' heteron ti touton agnoon ho anagignoskon exo tes alethines
   dianoias genetai. The same contention was often upheld in earlier times
   by Tertullian when driven into a corner by the exegesis of the
   Marcionites (see De pr√¶scr. adv. Marc. II.-V.). The exegetical
   "principle" of the Fathers gradually became the complexus oppositorum;
   i.e., when the literal meaning was disturbing, then it was, in the
   words of Gregory of Nazianzus, (Orat. XXXI. 3): enduma tes asebeias
   estin he philia tou grammatos: or men spoke of the turpitudo litterr√¶,
   the Jewish understanding of Scripture, the necessity of considering
   historical circumstances or the like. But if "advanced" theologians
   produced suspected allegorical explanations, then the cry was raised
   hos echei, echei, Holy Scripture is not to be understood according to
   Plato, etc.

   [415] The distinction between Alexandrian--Origenistic--and Antiochene
   exegesis does not consist in the representatives of the latter having
   rejected wholesale the spiritual meaning. They rather recognised it,
   but they tried to determine it typically from the literal meaning.
   While the Alexandrians avowedly set aside the literal meaning in many
   passages, and attached the pneumatic sense to texts by some sort of
   device, the Antiochenes started from the literal meaning, seeking to
   discover it by all the means of a sound exegesis, and then showed that
   the narrative concerned was a skia ton mellonton, a type created by
   God, which had been fulfilled by Jesus Christ. They set up definite
   rules for the discovery of the literal meaning as well as for that of
   the typical and allegorical sense (theoria, not allegoria), which lay
   not in the words, but the realities, persons, and events designated by
   the words. The rules are strikingly like those of the Federal
   theologians--Cocceius--and the school of Hofmann; the method of the
   author of the Hebrews furnished their model. This procedure had various
   results. First, the method of Philo and Origen followed by the
   Alexandrians was strenuously opposed both in independent treatises, and
   in connection with exegesis. Secondly, an effort was made to give the
   literal meaning in all cases its due; thus Diodorus says in the Catena
   of Nicephorus (Leipz. 1772, I. p. 524): tou allegorikou to historikon
   pleiston hoson protimomen. Thirdly, a real covenant was accordingly
   recognised between God and the Jewish people, and that nation was
   accorded its significant place in the history of salvation: the
   "history of salvation" which thus originated differed essentially from
   that of Iren√¶us (see Vol. II., p. 305). Fourthly and finally, the
   number of directly Messianic passages in the O. T. became
   extraordinarily limited; while, according to pneumatic exegesis,
   everything in the O. T. was in a sense directly Messianic, i.e.,
   Christian, the Antiochenes only retained a few such passages. The
   horizon of O. T. authors was more correctly defined. Theodore decidedly
   disputed the presence of anything in the O. T. about the Son of God or
   the Trinity. Further, the Antiochenes distinguished grades of
   inspiration, namely, the spirit of prophecy, and that of wisdom, and
   they placed the former far above the latter. Although the advance of
   this exegesis on the Alexandrian is obvious, yet it is seriously
   defective in completeness and consistency in method. First, the
   Antiochenes, in spite of their polemic against the older
   expositors--Hippolytus, Origen, Eusebius, Apollinaris, Didymus, and
   Jerome--could not altogether divest themselves of the old principle of
   the authoritative interpretation of Scripture; "they regarded the old
   traditional doctrine, the exposition given by the Fathers, and the
   definitions of Synods, as the standard and touch-stone of agreement
   with the creed of the Church, and they made of this rule what use they
   pleased"; from this source their attitude became somewhat uncertain.
   Secondly, they only rarely succeeded in criticising the literal meaning
   historically; where they did, they employed rationalistic
   interpretations, and accordingly their procedure approximated to
   Origen's. speculative exegesis, yet without following any fixed
   principle. Thirdly, their typological exegesis also often bordered very
   closely on the allegorical, and since they assumed a double sense in
   Scripture, they did not remove, but only disguised, the fundamental
   error of current exegesis. Fourthly, they could not make clear the
   difference between the O. T. and the N. T., because, in spite of their
   assumption of different degrees of inspiration, they placed the O. T.
   prophets on a level with the Apostles; see Theodore, Comment. on Neh.
   I. in Migne, T. LXVI., p. 402: tes autes tou hagiou pneumatos charitos
   hoi te palai meteichon kai hoi to tes kaines diathekes huperetoumenos
   musterio. Finally, by assuming directly Messianic passages in the O. T.
   they gave up their own position, and placed themselves at the mercy of
   their opponents. See later for the history of the school of Antioch,
   especially its relation to Aristotle. Diestel, Gesch. des A. T. in der
   christl. Kirche, p. 126 ff. Fritzsche, de Theod. Mops. vita et
   scriptis, Halae, 1836. Above all, the works of Kihn, Die Bedeutung der
   Antioch. Schule a. d. exeget. Gebiete (1866), and Theodor von
   Mopsuestia und Junilius als Exegeten (1880), where the older literature
   is given. Swete, Theodori ep. Mops. in epp. Pauli Comment. Cambridge,
   1880, 1881.

   [416] These rules are of material importance (for theology). The first
   treats of the Lord and his body: i.e., we must and may apply the truth
   concerning the Lord to the Church, and vice versa, since they form one
   person; only in this way do we frequently get a correct sense. The
   second deals with the bi-partite body of the Lord: we must carefully
   consider whether the true or the empirical Church is meant. The third
   takes up the promises and the law, i.e., the spirit and letter; the
   fourth treats of genus and species: we must observe the extent to which
   texts apply; the fifth, of the dates: we must harmonise contradictory
   dates by a fixed method, and understand certain stereotyped numbers as
   symbolical. The sixth discusses repetition: i.e., we have frequently to
   refrain from assuming a chronological order, where such an order
   appears to exist, and the seventh deals with the devil and his body,
   i.e., the devil and the godless, many things referring to the latter
   which are said of the devil and vice versa--see the first rule.

   [417] The thought wavers between that of Origen, who also elevates
   himself above the historical Christ, and the genuinely evangelical idea
   that the Christian must stop short at "means of salvation"; see De
   doctr. I. 34: "Nulla res in via (ad deum) tenere nos debet, quando nec
   ipse dominus, in quantum via nostra esse dignatus est, tenere nos
   voluerit, sed transire; ne rebus temporalibus, quamvis ab illo pro
   salute nostra susceptis et gestis, h√¶reamus infirmiter, sed per eas
   potius curramus alacriter etc." In ch. 35 love is held up as the
   exclusive goal: ch. 36 teaches that no one has understood Scripture who
   has not been led by it to love God and his neighbour; but if he has
   been led to this love, then he loses nothing by failing to hit on the
   correct sense of detached texts: in that case he is deceived, but
   without guilt: "Quisquis in scripturis (I. 37) aliud sentit quam ille
   qui scripsit, illis non mentientibus fallitur; sed tamen, ut dicere
   coeperam, si ea sententia fallitur, qua √¶dificet caritatem, qu√¶ finis
   pr√¶cepti est, ita fallitur ac si quisquam errore deserens viam, eo
   tamen per agrum pergat, quo etiam via illa perducit." Augustine says
   indeed (l. c.): "titubabit fides, si divinarum scripturarum vacillat
   auctoritas," but, on the other hand (I. 39): "Homo, fide, spe et
   caritate subnixus eaque inconcusse retinens, non indiget scipturis nisi
   ad alios instruendos. Itaque multi per h√¶c tria etiam in solitudine
   sine codicibus vivunt . . . Quibus tamen quasi machinis tanta fidei,
   spei et caritatis in eis surrexit instructio, ut perfectum aliquid
   tenentes, ea qu√¶ sunt ex parte non qu√¶rant; perfectum sane, quantum in
   hac vita potest." This forcible way of assigning a practical purpose to
   the reading of Scripture and the understanding at the root of it, viz.,
   that it was the whole that was of importance, is the opposite of the
   conception that Scripture embraces innumerable mysteries; but an
   affinity exists far down between them, inasmuch as Augustine seems to
   reserve to the monks the state in which Scripture is not required, and
   he borders on the belief of Origen (I. 34) that the Christ of history
   belongs to the past for him who lives in love. The whole conception is
   first found, besides, in the description by the Valentinian school of
   the perfect Gnostic; see Excerpta ex Theodoto, ch. 27: pou de eti
   graphes kai matheseos katorthoma te psuche ekeine te kathara genomene,
   hopou kai axioutai prosopon pros prosopon Theon horan; besides
   Augustine expressly argued against those who supposed they could
   dispense with Scripture from the start, and appealed to an inner
   revelation (see the Pr√¶fat. to De doctr. christ.). He puts it beyond
   doubt that he who uses Scripture must bow to its authority even where
   he does not understand it.

   [418] See the second and especially the third book of the work quoted.
   The second contains a short and precise review of all branches of
   knowledge which are collectively perceived to spring from heathenism,
   and it states which may and must be used by the Christian, and to what
   extent. The third book contains the hermeneutics proper.

   [419] See Eucherius of Lyons, liber formularum spiritalis intelligenti√¶
   ad Veranium filium, in Migne, Ser. lat. T. 50, p. 727. In later times
   the mnemonic formula was composed:


   Littera gesta docet, quid credas allegoria,

   Moralis quid agas, quo tendas anagogia.

   [420] The work "On Christian Science" points to Scripture as its sole
   object, and does not discuss tradition at all. However, the latter
   receives its due inasmuch as Augustine regards the propositions of the
   rule of faith--based on the Symbol--as the matters, which constituted
   the essential contents of Scripture. In this definition we find. the
   reason why dogmatics never ceased to waver between Scripture and the
   rule of faith. Yet we know that Augustine was by no means the first to
   hold this view. Even the writer of the Muratorian fragment and Iren√¶us
   knew no better.

   [421] Origen taught that Christian science was the science of
   Scripture; Augustine stands upon his shoulders. But afterwards, in the
   East, the interest in dogmatic formulas became uppermost, while in the
   West, the Bible remained pre-eminently the direct source of knowledge
   of the faith.

   [422] Even the men of Antioch, by whom, Chrysostom not excepted, human
   elements were aknowledged to exist in the Bible, maintained the
   inspiration of other passages quoad litteram, just like Origen and the
   Cappadocians. Augustine accepted this freedom from error in its
   strictest sense; see Ep. 82. 3 (ad Hieron.): "Ego fateor caritati tu√¶,
   solis eis scriptuaram libris, qui iam canonici appellantur, didici hunc
   timorem honoremque deferre, ut nullum eorum auctorem scribendo aliquid
   errasse firmissime credam. Ac si aliquid in eis offendero litteris,
   quod videatur contrarium veritati, nihil aliud quam vel mendosum esse
   codicem, vel interpretem non assecutum esse quod dictum est, vel me
   minime intellexisse non ambigam." In his work De consensu evang., which
   is particularly instructive as regards his whole attitude to Holy Writ,
   he declares that the Apostles' writings make up sufficiently for the
   absence of any by our Lord; for the Apostles were the Lord's hands, and
   had written what he commanded. It is extremely surprising that this
   being the view taken of the Bible--and even the translation of the LXX.
   was held to be inspired--yet no one ever ex professo reflected on how
   the Canon was formed. No miracle was assumed. Even Augustine quite
   naively stated, sancti et docti homines had formed the N. T. (c.
   Faustum XXII. 79). Here the authority of the Church comes in.

   [423] The early Catholic Fathers had already maintained the sufficiency
   of Holy Scripture, as well as the necessity of proving everything out
   of it; see for the latter point Orig. in Jerem., Hom. I. c. 7 (Lomm.
   XV. p. 115): Marturas dei labein tas graphas. Amarturoi gar hai
   epibolai hemon kai hai exegeseis apistoi eisin. Cyril of Jerusalem has
   expressed himself similarly (Cat. 4, 17: Dei gar peri ton theion kai
   agion tes pisteos musterion mede to tuchon aneu ton theion
   paradidosthai graphon; kai me haplos pithanotesi kai logon kataskeuais
   parapheresthai. Mede emoi to tauta soi legonti, haplos pisteuses; ean
   ten apodeixin ton katangellomenon apo ton theion me labes graphon; He
   soteria gar haute tes pisteos hemon ouk ex heuresilogias, alla ex
   apodeixeos ton theion esti graphon); cf. Athanasius (Orat. adv. gentes
   init.: Autarkeis men eisin hai hagiai kai theopneustoi graphai pros ten
   tes aletheias apangelian). So also the Antiochenes, moreover Augustine
   De doctr. II. 9: "In iis qu√¶ aperte in scriptura posita sunt,
   inveniuntur illa omnia, qu√¶ continent fidem moresque vivendi, spem
   scilicet et caritatem." Vincent., Commonit. 2.

   [424] All the more did the use made of the O. T. for the constitution
   of the Church differ from the apologetic view. Very many of the
   regulations of the O. T. ceremonial law came once more to be highly
   valued by the Church, not as spiritually understood, but as directly
   applied to ecclesiastical institutions of every sort.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. Tradition.

   The authority of Holy Scripture frequently appears in the Fathers as
   something wholly abstract and despotic. It contained, in fact, a latent
   tendency to assert its independence of the conditions out of which it
   had arisen. But the revolution which was characterised by the isolation
   of the Bible, its deliverance from the authority of ecclesiastical
   tradition, and the annihilation of the latter, only took place in the
   sixteenth century, and even then it was, we know, not completely
   successful. In ecclesiastical antiquity, on the contrary, the bond was
   by no means severed which connected Scripture with the maternal
   organism of the Church. The Church, its doctrine, institutions, and
   constitution, were held, in and by themselves, to constitute the source
   of knowledge and the authoritative guarantee of truth. As the holy,
   Apostolic, and Catholic institution, it possessed nothing whatever
   untrue or capable of amendment either in its foundations or its
   development. Everything in it, rather, was apostolic, and the guidance
   of the Church by the Holy Ghost had preserved this apostolic fabric
   from any change. This thought was necessarily emphasised more and more
   strongly in consequence of the development undergone by Church affairs
   in the fourth and following centuries. Since at the same time, however,
   the independent authority and the sufficiency of the Bible were also
   emphasised, there arose difficulties, in part even manifest
   inconsistencies, which were never removed. [425] But they were not
   clearly felt, because men always possessed the power, when confronted
   by inconvenient monitors, to carry through ultimately, whether in the
   form of dogma, or in that of order, whatever was required. In face of
   traditions become obsolete an appeal was made to other traditions, or
   to the Bible; where written testimony was uncertain or awanting,
   recourse was had to tradition; i.e., that was declared to be tradition
   which was not to be justified under another title. Hence it is already
   clear that tradition never was and never could be systematised and
   catalogued, that an authentic declaration never was and never could be
   published as to its extent and scope. There was no single deliverance
   on the application of tradition, which would not, if consistently
   carried out, have thrown the Church into confusion. If Augustine
   therefore (De bapt. c. Donat. II.3, 4) declared--certainly against his
   better knowledge--that canonical Scripture was contained within fixed
   limits of its own' (scriptura canonica certis suis terminis
   continetur), yet it never occurred to him or any one else to maintain
   as much about tradition. The latter was in antiquity a wholly elastic
   category, as we see when we look at its use in individual cases; in
   summa it was, however, an extremely rigid and clear notion: meaning
   simply that the Church was determined, in spite of all changes, to
   regard itself as the unchangeable creation of the Apostles. It derived
   its claim to this view partly from the divine promises, partly from the
   organisation instituted for it, yet without alleging confidently any
   empirical factor within the Church which should be the bearer of its
   infallibility. [426] The most important consequences of this view held
   by the Church regarding itself have been already stated in the second
   volume; but others came to be added in the post-Constantinian period.

   A. The creed of the Church was always held to be the most important
   part of its tradition. The anti-gnostic formulas which the creed had
   preserved passed over in the East, along with theorems, half biblical
   half speculative, and here and there with purely philosophical or
   polemical discussions, into the Symbols. [427] These Symbols, which had
   been adopted for use in the Church, were regarded as apostolic
   testimonies. Their phrasing was not considered in the East to be due to
   the Apostles, but the honour paid them was justified from the Apostles'
   preaching. [428] These Symbols of the provincial Churches were
   supplanted in the period between the first and third (fourth)
   OEcumenical Councils by the Nicene, or soon thereafter by the so-called
   Constantinopolitan Symbol. [429] This confession [430] had already been
   held at Chalcedon to be the creed pure and simple, and it never lost
   this place of honour. If it had already been constantly assumed that
   the doctrine of the Church was the theme, or the matter, constituting
   the real contents of Scripture, then this assumption was now definitely
   transferred to the Nicene or the Constantinopolitan Symbol. All
   subsequent dogmatic conclusions were accordingly regarded solely as
   explanations of this Symbol, [431] which was not maintained, however,
   to be of Apostolic origin--in its language. Tradition, in the strictest
   sense of the term, consisted in the contents of the Symbol for the time
   being. Cyril says of this (Cat. V. 12): In these few paragraphs the
   whole dogma of the faith (is) comprised' (en oligois tois stichois to
   pan dogma tes pisteos perilambano'menon). As the Church had obtained in
   the Nicene Creed a complete and uniform Symbol, the view was
   transferred to it. There were two sides meanwhile to the relations of
   Scripture and Symbol. You might not believe the contents of the Symbol
   unless you could convince yourself of their truth from Scripture; [432]
   but on the other hand, your interpretation of Scripture had to be
   regulated by the creed laid down in the Symbol. [433] In the West a
   unique dignity was retained by the old Roman Symbol (or its parallel
   forms in the provincial Churches) which was regarded as being composed
   of twelve articles. From the fourth century at least it was held to be
   the Apostolic Creed in the strict sense of the term. [434] Its brevity
   and simplicity long preserved the Roman Church from extravagant
   theological speculations, but they could not barricade it against the
   theological development of the East. An industrious attempt was made,
   or at least professed, to derive the decision of dogmatic questions, as
   they emerged, from this Apostolic Symbol, and to rest upon it the whole
   of the ever increasing material of dogmatics. [435] It was only after
   the beginning of the fifth century that the Constantinopolitan Symbol
   supplanted the apostolic in Church use in Rome and the West, [436] yet
   without the latter losing its prestige. This was of course transferred
   in part to the new Symbol, but the old remained, though latent, in
   force. [437] The twelve articles the Apostolic Symbol, to be explained
   by the Constantinopolitan, constituted in the West the ecclesiastical
   tradition kat' exochen. Justinian's legislation confirmed this
   conception, though, indeed, that was not needed. [438]

   B. At the beginning of the fourth century there already entered into
   the composition of the Church, not only its creed, but a cultus fixed
   in its main features; there were further disciplinary and ceremonial
   provisions--still differing, indeed, in part in the various provincial
   Churches [439] --and finally, a settled constitution. It was only in a
   very late period that the notion of apostolicity was applied, in the
   strict sense, to the whole of these elements; [440] but not only did
   the foundations of these ordinances come to be characterised as
   apostolic, but as a rule, and to an increasing extent, everything which
   there was a desire to assure of permanence. Different methods were
   adopted, however, of establishing the apostolic character of these
   institutions. First, it was maintained that regulations observed by the
   whole Church required no proof that they were Apostolic. [441]
   Secondly, advantage was taken in the East, of the numerous legends of
   the Apostles current in the Churches; they began to be used in
   connection with the government and cultus of the Churches in such a way
   that definite detailed regulations were attributed to the Apostles,
   individually or collectively, whenever they were required for the
   discipline or cultus of the time. [442] Thirdly, men began in the
   fourth century--not uninfluenced by Clement and Origen--to introduce
   the notion of a paradosis agarphos (unwritten tradition), in whose
   wholly undefined contents were even included dogmatic theories which it
   was not everyone's business to understand; yet it dealt extremely
   seldom with the trinitarian and Christological catchwords. This idea of
   an unwritten tradition' crept in in a very real sense; for it
   conflicted with more than one main point in the fundamental positions
   of the Church. But it attained high honour, and its existence
   absolutely became a dogma. But because it really made all else
   unnecessary and was a dangerous dras tic expediet, it was not defined,
   nor was its extent ever determined. And it did not banish Scriptural
   proof or the appeal to familiar and demonstrable tradition. The
   existence was maintained of a tradition which dispensed with all
   criteria--and that was what the paradosis agraphos was; but a prudent
   use was made of it. Unwritten tradition was preferentially applied to
   the development of ritual and the sacramental performance of the
   mysteries, while the secret truths of the creed were based exclusively
   on Scripture and the Councils. [443] But this distinction was not
   sufficient, nor was it firmly held to be unalterable.

   C. All conceptions of the authority of tradition, of which many
   Fathers--e.g., Cyprian--described Scripture to be the main element,
   [444] were based ultimately on the conviction that the Church had been
   invested with authority through its connection with the Holy Spirit
   himself. [445] At this point two problems arose, which, though hardly
   ever clearly formulated, were yet felt, and which attempts were made to
   solve. I.--By whom and when did the Church speak? II.--How were
   novelties to be explained in the Church, especially in the sphere of
   doctrine, if the authority of the Church had its root exclusively in
   its apostolic character, that is, its ability to preserve the legacy of
   the Apostles?

   As to I. It was a settled doctrine from the third century, that the
   representation of the Church was vested in the Episcopate, though the
   strict conception of the latter, as first taught by Cyprian, that it
   was the main support of the Church, was for a long time not universally
   held. [446] We find, meanwhile, even, e.g., from the plan of Eusebius'
   Church History, that the Bishops, the successors of the Apostles, were
   regarded as guarantors of the legitimacy of the Church. The conception
   never emerged that the Bishop was infallible as an individual; [447]
   but a certain inspiration was already--though not without differences
   of opinion--attributed to the provincial Synods. [448] Constantine was
   the first to form the idea of a universal Synod, [449] and he also
   supposed such a body to be under the special guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, and therefore incapable of error. [450] In the course of the
   fourth century the idea that the Nicene Synod possessed an infallible
   authority became slowly established; [451] it was transferred in the
   following centuries to the OEcumenical Synods generally, yet so that
   one--the second--was only subsequently stamped as OEcumenical. [452]
   From the sixth century there gradually ceased to be any doubt that the
   resolutions of OEcumenical Synods possessed an absolute authority.
   [453] Whoever rebelled against them refused to admit that the Synods in
   question were regular, but did not dispute the authority of regular
   Synods in general. After the seventh Synod it was a settled principle
   in the orthodox Church of the East that Scripture and the decisions of
   the seven OEcumenical Councils formed the sources of the knowledge of
   Christian truth. [454] They were characterised simply as the tradition,
   nay, men spoke, and not infrequently speak and act up to the present
   day, as if the Church possessed and required no other sources of
   knowledge or authorities. As a rule, the paradosis agraphos is not
   included when Holy Scripture and the seven Councils are spoken of.

   This apparently simple, consistent development, seemingly corresponding
   to all requirements, did not, however, solve all difficulties, either
   after it had come to an end, or still less during its course. But it
   had further to reckon with authorities, some of which were of long
   standing, while others emerged in the contemporary organisation of the
   Church. What position was to be taken up in doctrinal controversies in
   which an OEcumenical Synod had not pronounced its decision? Must there
   not be forthcoming in the Church at any moment a clear testimony to the
   truth, solving all doubtful questions, and giving forth no uncertain
   sound? What importance was due to the occupants of the great episcopal
   chairs, the Bishops of the apostolic communities, and especially of
   Rome? Decisions were not reached in all these questions, but a certain
   common sense arose. First, the Church speaks also by a unanimous
   testimony, audible from the earliest days, and this testimony never has
   been and never for a moment is, lacking. What has been always,
   everywhere, and by all, believed is inerrant tradition, even if it has
   not been solemnly and formally attested, or laid down in primitive
   authorities. This leads to a procedure similar to that followed by
   Eusebius in settling the N. T., viz., that the antiquity, unanimous
   attestation, and catholicity of a doctrine are to be expiscated in
   order that it may be certified a doctrine of the Church. The notion of
   antiquity' had now been extended and shifted with the advance of the
   Church. In the fourth century all the teachers held orthodox before
   Origen had been regarded as ancient, or vicini apostolorum (neighbours
   of the Apostles); the latter predicate especially had gradually been
   extended to the beginning of the third century: men like Iren√¶us,
   Apollinaris of Hierapolis and Hippolytus even were called gnorimoi ton
   apostolon (friends of the Apostles). [455] Then the whole period of the
   martyrs came to be considered sacred as the ancient time. But the
   Church was compelled to recognise to an increasing extent, that not
   much was to be gained for its purposes from its theological witnesses'
   before Athanasius, from those before as well as after Origen. Their
   names were still held in sacred memory--with the exception of those who
   seemed too greatly compromised, or had even fallen into bad odour with
   their own contemporaries; but their works disappeared more and more, or
   gave place to forgeries. Accordingly, from the fifth century,
   Athanasius and orthodox teachers of similar views of the fourth
   century, appeared as the "Fathers" proper. [456] When controversies
   arose, and soon even at Synods, the votes of these men were counted.
   Doctrines were looked on as armed with the testimony of antiquity, when
   they could be supported from the Fathers from Athanasius to Cyril. Nor
   were forgeries wanting here. The disciples of Apollinaris of Laodicea
   practised these frauds to a vast extent, in order to rediscover their
   master's teaching in antiquity; they were afterwards imitated by
   others. In any case, the tribunal of the Fathers' remained an uncertain
   one; great as was the scope assigned to it, its place and value were
   not dogmatically detailed. It was not even really decided what relation
   the inspiration of the Councils held to the consensus patrum, [457]
   (see under). Such a consensus had often enough to be first restored;
   this was done by exegesis, or even by fabrications, because it was
   necessary to presuppose it. References of an opposite character
   remained of no effect; but when needs must a want of accuracy
   (akribeia) and detached errors were admitted in the case of individual
   Fathers, without the general conception being modified by these
   concessions. The Fathers were just read backwards--so to speak--i.e.,
   from the standpoint of the dogma of the time being, and their
   undeveloped or divergent doctrines were interpreted in accordance with
   the principle of making the best of everything. [458]

   Secondly, a peculiar reverence was inherited from the past for
   Apostolic Churches or their bishops, entwined with the evidence based
   on history and dogmatics. Although the theory of Cyprian, which allowed
   no special importance to the Bishops of Apostolic communities within
   the general authority of the Episcopate, had weakened this prestige, it
   still held its ground. Augustine still recalled it in the question of
   the extent of the Holy Scriptures. [459] But there now grew up, in
   consequence of the Metropolitan and Patriarchate form of government, a
   new aristocracy among the Bishops, which received its importance from
   the size and influence of the episcopal cities. Rome, Alexandria--the
   founding of whose Church by Mark was undisputed about A.D. 300--and
   Antioch were not affected by the rivalry involved in this new
   principle; for in these cases the special connection with the Apostles
   coincided with the greatness of the city. But the political factor
   prevailed so strongly that the Chairs of Corinth, Thessalonica, etc.,
   and finally, even that of Ephesus, [460] lost all peculiar
   prestige--only that of Jerusalem, in spite of the political
   insignificance of the city, was ranked with those more distinguished
   [461] --but Constantinople was added to the list of the outstanding
   episcopates. In the East this was frankly justified by the political
   position of the city; [462] but this justification was so far
   insufficient as the chair, by its co-ordination with the Apostolic
   sees, participated in the attributes which the latter possessed in
   virtue of their apostolic character. [463] Such attributes continued to
   be ascribed to those chairs without it being stated, however, in what
   they really consisted. They were nothing tangible, and yet they were
   held to exist. [464] But even in the view of Orientals they belonged in
   a pre√´minent degree to Rome. The works of the only western author
   before Jerome who was also read in the East--i.e., Cyprian--could not
   fail to heighten the prestige of Rome. [465] But that was already great
   enough in itself. As the ancient capital of the Empire, as the city of
   the two chief Apostles, of the Cathedra Petri, as the only apostolic
   community of the West, that which had done more for the whole Church
   than any other, Rome even in the East enjoyed a unique prestige. [466]
   But as early as the fourth century, and certainly from the fifth
   onwards, Rome. meant the Roman Bishop, with whose spiritual dignity
   were fused the memories of the ancient city that had ruled the world.
   These memories overhung the place, after the Emperor had left, and the
   most of them clung to the Bishop. In the momentous Arian conflict the
   great Eastern sees, except Alexandria, became compromised or
   dishonoured; the orthodox Orientals sought and found their support in
   Rome. [467] The Emperor in Constantinople who brought the great
   controversy to an end was a Western, full of veneration for Rome. The
   promotion which he afterwards assigned to Constantinople was no
   equivalent--at first, at least,--for the advance in political power
   secured to Rome by the Arian controversy. [468] The role of observer
   and arbiter, which the Roman Bishop was able to play in the
   Christological controversies, made it possible for him to maintain for
   a time the lofty position he had won. [469] (On the aspirations of the
   Alexandrian Bishops, Athanasius, Peter, etc., and the successful
   opposition to them by Leo, see chap. IX.) There can be no doubt that
   even in the eyes of the Orientals there attached to the Roman Bishop a
   special something, which was wanting to all the rest, a nimbus which
   conferred upon him a peculiar authority. [470] Yet this nimbus was not
   sufficiently bright and luminous to bestow upon its possessor an
   unimpeachable authority; it was rather so nebulous that it was possible
   to disregard it without running counter to the spirit of the universal
   Church. And it gradually became fainter. The more completely, after the
   middle of the fifth century, the internal relations of West and East
   ceased, and the more strongly the distinctively Byzantine spirit could
   assert itself in the diminished Church of the East, so the more rapidly
   declined the prestige of the Roman Bishop. Constantinople put an end to
   it in its own midst, when the Roman Bishop set up claims which in the
   fourth and fifth centuries had been palliated by actual circumstances
   and the necessities of the time, but which 500 years afterwards could
   not fail to be felt as the intrusion of an alien spirit. [471] Yet, in
   spite of this, the idea of the unity of the Church still held its
   ground for a long time. After Synods ceased to be held, the influence
   of the great Patriarchates throughout the whole Church in the East
   increased [472] --though, indeed, the orthodox Patriarchs of
   Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, had lost their real importance; and
   theoretically the dignity of the Roman Bishop as primus inter pares,
   though not unassailed, was embraced in that of the great Eastern sees.
   But it was never made clear how far the Patriarchs in their collective
   capacity really constituted an authority in dogma: there is not even an
   explicit statement that they did form such an authority. There was an
   uncertainty of opinion as to their position alongside of and in the
   OEcumenical Synods. [473] Here also there was an absence of fixed
   definitions. The Church as it is, with its graduated orders, crowned by
   the Patriarchs, constituted the tradition and the authority. But the
   authority of no factor in this system possessed, when isolated, any
   significance whatever. It might not assert itself at the expense of the
   rest. Its dignity was founded on its being a part of antiquity.

   As to II. This at once involves the answer to the second question (see
   p. 214). The assumption that the Councils were inspired did not imply
   any power on their part to deliver new revelations to the Church. On
   the contrary, they proved their peculiar possession of the Holy Spirit
   by their unfailing testimony to the ancient doctrinal tradition. [474]
   But in that case the new formulas created by the Councils could not but
   cause offence. How far they did is shown by the history of the dogmatic
   controversies. Above all, the unbiblical catch-word consubstantial'
   (Homoousios), for a time directly rejected by the Church, only won
   acceptance under great difficulties, even among those who had little or
   no objection to the cause it represented. These formulas had to be
   proved in some way or other to have been anciently held. For Homoousios
   it was of the highest importance that a Council had made it an
   accomplished fact. As the word gradually made good its ground, the
   Council lay far enough in the past to be itself regarded as belonging
   to antiquity. The evidence was got by reasoning in a circle; the
   authority of the Council supported the word which was anything but old,
   but the authority of any Council was dependent on its rejection of all
   innovations. Numerous passages in the Fathers furnished material in
   confirmation of the later formulas--which were never, so far as I know,
   bluntly deduced from unwritten tradition (paradosis agraphos); but a
   strong preference was shown for understanding them as a repetition of
   the Nicene Symbol, the explication being disregarded, just as Iren√¶us
   in his time had passed off the Symbol unfolded in an antignostic sense,
   the regula fidei, for the Symbol itself, i.e., for the ancient
   repository of the truth. In spite of all novelties, it was thus
   contended that novelties were not forthcoming in the Church. Nay, even
   the power of the Councils to unfold doctrines authoritatively was not
   plainly asserted in the East; on the other hand, a Western, Vincentius
   of Lerinum, did maintain it, and essayed to furnish a theory on the
   subject. After the uncertainties of the Greeks over the conception of
   tradition, we really breathe freely when we study the attempt of this
   man to introduce light and certainty into the question. However, even
   in the East, the younger generation now and then gave the older Fathers
   the benefit of looking at their words as having been uttered at a time
   when dogma was not yet explained, or sharply formulated. Strictly
   speaking, this expedient was not tenable on Greek ground. Only a very
   sparing use therefore was made of it there, [475] while the Catholic
   West employs it to a great extent up to the present day. [476]

   The conception of tradition is accordingly quite obscure. The
   hierarchical element does not in theory play the leading part in it.
   The apostolical succession has in theory had no such thorough-going
   importance even in the West for the proof of tradition as one would
   expect. After the time of the Councils the authority of the Bishops as
   bearers of tradition was wholly spent on that proof. Yet even that is
   perhaps saying too much. Everything was really obscure. So far,
   however, as the Greek Church has not changed since John of Damascus,
   the Greek has at present a perfectly definite sense of the foundation
   of religion. Besides Holy Scripture, tradition is the source of
   knowledge of, the authority for, the truth; and tradition is the Church
   itself, not, as in the West, governed by Rome, as a sovereign, living
   power, but in its immovable, thousand-year-old doctrines and orders.
   Even Scripture is to be explained by the tradition which transmits it,
   although Scripture is itself to some extent the caput et origo
   traditionis. But tradition still really presents itself in two forms as
   it did among the earliest Alexandrians: there is a perfectly official
   form--now that of the Councils, and one more profound and
   indefinite--corresponding to the scientific tradition' (paradosis
   gnostike) of the ancient Alexandrians.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [425] The Orientals, especially the Antiochenes, but Cyril of Jerus.
   also, adhered more exclusively to Scripture; the Alexandrians, and even
   the Cappadocians relied more strongly on tradition. Yet the differences
   are only in degree. At any rate, the difference comes out more strongly
   on a comparison of Theodoret and Cyril of Alexandria.

   [426] Reuter's excellent explanation of Augustine's position (Ztschrft.
   f√ºr K.-Gesch. Vol. VIII., pp. 181 f., 186 f.) was then true of very
   wide circles: "The Episcopate, and the Roman sedes apostolica, the
   whole relatively co√∂rdinated sedes apostolic√¶, the relative and the
   absolute plenary councils were held to be representations of the
   (infallible) Church; but not one of these factors, not all of them
   combined, formed the (infallible) representation of the (infallible)
   Church. The latter possessed no indubitably sure institution or organs,
   indubitably representative of it." The decrees of councils were only
   placed on a complete equality with Scripture in the East, after
   councils had ceased to be held, and when the latter therefore were
   seen, like Scripture, in a nimbus of hoary antiquity.

   [427] See Vol. II., p. 20 f. and III., pp. 48 ff., 111 ff.

   [428] The Symbol of Gregory Thaumaturgus was derived from a special
   revelation; see Vol. III., p. 115.

   [429] There were two symbol-constructing periods in the East before a
   universal Confession was framed. The former of these embraced A.D.
   250-325, the second, A.D. 325 up to the beginning or the middle of the
   fifth century. In the latter period the attempt was made, either to
   transform the Nicene Creed into a baptismal Confession, or to displace
   it by parallel formulas; sometimes the leading words of the Nicene
   Symbol were inserted in those of the provincial Churches. See on the
   history of this, the part played by the Bishops of Asia Minor in these
   developments, and the history of the so-called Constantinop. Symbol, my
   art. "Konstantinop. Symbol" in Herzog R.-E. 21 Vol. VIII.; Caspari's
   works, Hort's investigations, Two Dissertations, Cambridge, 1876, and
   Kattenbusch, Confessionskunde I., p. 252 ff.

   [430] It was originally the Baptismal Confession of the Church of
   Jerusalem, revised soon after the middle of the fourth century, and
   furnished with a regula fidei concerning the Holy Spirit; it came thus
   to be honoured first through the authority of Epiphanius, and then
   through the energy of the Bishop of Constantinople, which also led to
   its supplanting the Nicene Symbol.

   [431] Monophysites and orthodox believers always professed to be able
   to read their Christological formulas word for word in the Symbol. The
   Greek Church maintains to the present day that the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan Symbol contains everything we require to
   believe.

   [432] So, above all, Cyril and the Antiochenes.

   [433] No hesitation prevailed in the Church on this point; yet Synods
   simply forbade certain expositions of Scriptural texts as heretical.
   The Church alone furnished the gubernaculum interpretationis (see
   Vincent., Commonit. 2, 41) and that in its concise guide to faith, the
   Symbol. After the Constantinopolitan Symbol had been placed on an
   inaccessible height, we no longer find the blunt assertion that the
   creed is compiled from the Holy Scriptures. But this contention was
   also historically false. (For it see Cyril, Cat. V. 12): ou gar hos
   edoxen anthropois sunetethe ta tes Pisteos; all' ek pases graphes ta
   kairiotata sullechthenta mian anapleroi ten tes Pisteos didaskalian.
   "Canon" was originally the rule of faith; the Scripture had in truth
   intervened, yet so that its authority had a support placed still
   further back, namely, the O. T. and the Lord's sayings.

   [434] See my art. "Apostolisches Symbol" in Herzog R.-E. 2 B. I. The
   opinion that the Apostles had composed the Symbol jointly (Rufinus)
   cannot be traced earlier than the middle of the fourth century, but it
   may be much older. Yet we must not date it too soon; for if the
   Churches of the western provinces had received the Symbol with this
   legend attached, they would hardly have ventured to propose changes on
   it. It was certainly not extolled even in Rome in the third century, so
   exuberantly as it was afterwards by Ambrose.

   [435] This point falls to be discussed in the next book. Augustine had
   to rest his distinctive theology on the Symbol, though the latter was
   only imperfectly adapted for the purpose.

   [436] See my art. on the Constantinop. Symbol, 1. c.

   [437] The history of the Apostolic Symbol between the fifth and sixth
   centuries urgently requires investigation.

   [438] Justinian's law-book is headed by the art. "De summa trinitate et
   de fide catholica et ut nemo de ea publice contendere audeat"; but see
   also the famous decree of the Emperors, Gratian, Valentinian and
   Theodosius, A.D. 380, with which the law-book begins.

   [439] See, e.g., Socrates, H. E. V. 22.

   [440] When this occurred a very exact distinction had already been made
   between faith and disciplinary law. Apostolic faith was something
   different from and higher than apostolic laws {diataxeis, nomoi,
   kanones ekklesiastikoi dia ton apostolon}. This corrected the equality
   apparently attributed to the two branches of tradition by the common
   predicate "apostolic."

   [441] See August., De bapt. c. Donat. II. 7, 12: "Multa, qu√¶ non
   inveniuntur in litteris apostolorum neque in conciliis posteriorum, et
   tamen quia per universam custodiuntur ecclesiam, non nisi ab ipsis
   tradita et commendata creduatur." IV. 24. 31: "Quod universa tenet
   ecclesia, nec conciliis institutum sed semper retentum est, non nisi
   auctoritate apostolica traditum rectissime creditur." V. 23. 31:
   "Multa, qu√¶ universa tenet ecclesia et ob hoc ab apostolis pr√¶cepta
   bene creduntur, quamquam scripta non reperiantur."

   [442] The Apologists had exhibited Christianity as the worship of God
   in Spirit and in truth, and as an alliance regulated by equality and
   fraternity. But there had gradually developed a complicated cultus
   round the mysteries, and a comprehensive and detailed code of
   discipline had become necessary. For both of these appeal was made to
   an increasing extent to apostolic authority. Compare the Apostolic
   Constitutions, the kanones ekklesastikoi', the Apostolic Canons, in
   general the mass of material, partly published, partly discussed, by
   Bickell, Pitra, and Lagarde; further, the designation of the Liturgies
   of the provincial Churches as by Mark, James, etc. The history, still
   partly unwritten, of these Eastern forgeries under apostolic names is
   closely connected with the general history of the legends of the
   Apostles (see Lipsius, Die apokryphen Apostelgesch.). The O. T.
   commandments were again introduced into the Church by means of
   apostolic fictions, until the ancient awe of Moses, the law-giver, was
   surmounted. After apostolic commandments of this sort had been allowed
   to spring up luxuriantly for a time, the Church had no little trouble
   to exorcise the spirits it had conjured. A sifting process began from
   the sixth century--at least in the Byzantine Church--to which, e.g.,
   the Constitutions fell a victim. In the law books of the Monophysite
   and Nestorian Churches, much more comprehensive matter had been
   preserved, under apostolic names, as possessed of the value of law. Yet
   it did not receive the same honour as the Holy Scriptures. In order to
   realise the possibility of such an unabashed invention of regulations
   cloaked with the authority and name of the Apostles, we must remember
   that, from the second century, writings bearing on discipline were in
   existence, called didachai or diataxeis ton apostolon, and that these,
   having no individual impress, were thoroughly adapted for constant
   remodelling and expansion.

   [443] The assumption of a secret apostolic tradition--that is, the
   paradosis agraphos--first appeared among the Gnostics, i.e., among the
   first theologians, who had to legitimise as apostolic a world of
   notions alien to primitive Christianity. It then was found quite
   logically among the Alexandrians, and from them passed to Eusebius, who
   not only accepted it (H. E. II. 1, 4), but also vindicated it against
   Marcellus (lib. I. c. 1): ekklesias tas apo ton theion graphon
   marturias ex agraphou paradoseos sphragizomenes. But the Cappadocians
   first established it in their conflict with the Eunomians and
   Pneumatomachoi, yet the bold use made of it by them in defence of the
   dogma of the Trinity, was not afterwards parallelled. Basil (De spiritu
   sancto, 27) referred the orthodox doctrine of the Holy Ghost to the
   unwritten tradition, placing the latter on an equality with the public
   tradition; but he endeavoured at the same time to retain the old
   Alexandrian distinction between kerugma and dogma, dogma being meant to
   embrace the theological formulation of the faith (ton en te ekklesia
   pephulagmenon dogmaton kai kerugmaton ta men ek tes engraphou
   didaskalias echomen, ta de ek tes ton apostolon paradoseos diadothenta
   hemin en musterio paredexametha aper amphotera ten auten ischun echei
   pros ten eusebeian . . . allo gar dogma, kai allo kerugma, ta men gar
   dogmata siopatai, ta de kerugmata demosieuetai). The latter distinction
   was opposed to the tendency of the age, and remained without effect.
   (With that which Basil named dogma, the mustike paradosis was
   identical, of which Pamphilus and Eusebius speak, and by the aid of
   which they defended the orthodoxy of Origen; see Socrates III. 7.) But
   it is important that in order to prove the existence of a paradosis
   agraphos, Basil appeals merely to matters of ritual--signs of the
   Cross, prayers of consecration, and baptismal rites. To these the
   unwritten tradition was in later times almost exclusively applied.
   Gregory of Nazianzus advanced in a different direction from Basil: he
   admitted to his opponents (Orat. 37) that tradition was defective in
   reference to the doctrine of the Spirit, but he believed he could
   assume a progressive development of the truth of revelation. But, as
   far as I know, he only once expressed himself so imprudently, and he
   found absolutely no imitators. His attempt only proves the difficulty
   caused by the defence of the dogma of the Trinity in the fourth
   century. In Cyril of Jerusalem (see his view so divergent from that of
   the Cappadocians, Cat. 16, ch. 2) and the older Antiochenes the
   paradosis agraphos does not occur, but it does in Epiphanius (H. 61,
   ch. 6: dei kai paradosei kechresthai. ou gar panta apo tes theias
   graphes dunatai lambanesthai; dio ta men en graphais, ta de en
   paradosesin paredokan hoi hagioi apostoloi). It is also found in
   Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and others down to John of Damascus,
   who says plainly (De fide orthod. IV. ch. 12): agraphos estin he
   paradosis haute ton apostolon, polla gar agraphos hemin paredosan (see
   details in Langen, Joh. von Damaskus, 1879, p. 271 ff.). So also the
   Greek Church of to-day teaches: dioreitai to theion rhema eis te to
   grapton kai agraphon (see Gass, Symbolik der griech. Kirche, p. 107
   ff.) Quotations are especially taken from Pauline texts in which
   paradoseis occur, and thus a sort of Scriptural proof is led in support
   of what does not occur in Scripture. The unwritten tradition is hardly
   again applied to the creed, since it was thought to be sufficiently
   supported by Scripture and the Symbol. In the West, Augustine was in
   the same doubtful position, with regard to certain theses which he
   defended against Donatists and Pelagians, as the Cappadocians were in
   reference to the orthodox doctrine of the Holy Ghost. Hence he derived,
   e.g., the doctrine of original sin, which could not be otherwise proved
   out of tradition, from the rite of exorcism, declaring this to have
   been an apostolic tradition; (see c. Julian. VI. 5, 11): "Sed etsi
   nulla ratione indagetur, nullo sermone explicetur, verum tamen est quod
   antiquitus veraci fide catholica pr√¶dicatur et creditur per ecclesiam
   totam; qu√¶ filios fidelium nec exorcizaret, nec exsufflaret, si non eos
   de potestate tenebrarum et a principe mortis erueret, etc.). So also he
   appealed against the Donatists in the controversy as to Baptism by
   Heretics (against Cyprian's authority) to the unwritten testimony of
   the whole Church (see note 6, p. 211).

   [444] Cyprian calls Scripture "divin√¶ traditionis caput et origo"
   (Ep.74, ch. 10). This designation is not common.

   [445] The universal conviction is expressed in the famous sentence of
   Augustine (C. ep. Manich. 6) which he has given in various forms in the
   Confessions and elsewhere: Ego vero evangelio non crederem, nisi me
   catholic√¶ ecclesi√¶ commoveret auctoritas. Even Cyril of Jerusalem, who
   has emphasised most strongly the authority of Scripture, could not pass
   over that of the Church (Cat. IV., ch. 33).

   [446] In his studies on Augustine, Reuter has shown that Augustine fell
   short of Cyprian (see his theses in the Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch., Vol.
   VIII., p. 184, and the relative discussions in Vol. VII.). In the East
   the compiler of Apostolic Constitutions took substantially the view of
   the Episcopate held by Ignatius, but not by Iren√¶us and Cyprian. Even
   Chrysostom's work, peri hierosunes, tends in the same direction as the
   Constitutions. It is very remarkable that Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat.
   XVIII., ch. 27) makes no mention of the hierarchy, but only of the
   Apostles, prophets, teachers and other office-bearers enumerated in the
   well-known passage in the Ep. to the Corinthians. That is a memorable
   archaism; yet see even Vincentius, Commonit. 40. He also says very
   little about Bishops, and nothing at all about. the apostolic
   succession.

   [447] On the contrary, the fallibility of individual bishops was always
   admitted from Iren√¶us down (III. 3, 1): "Valde perfectos et
   irreprehensibiles in omnibus eos volebant esse (apostoli), quos et
   successores relinquebant, suum ipsorum locum magisterii tradentes,
   quibus emendate agentibus fieret magna utilitas, lapsis autem summa
   calamitas."

   [448] Cyprian (Ep. LVII., ch. 5) introduces the decree of the
   provincial Council of Carthage with the words, "Placuit nobis spiritu
   sancto suggerente." Acts XV. 28 certainly influenced this phrase. On
   the other hand, we must not allow it too much weight, for Cyprian often
   appeals to instructions given to him personally by the Holy Ghost. See
   also the Votum of Bishop Lucius of Ausafa, No. 73 of the sentent.
   episcoporum LXXXVII. at the Carthaginian Council: "Secundum motum animi
   mei et spiritus sancti." The Synod of Arles, A.D. 314, also used the
   formula, "Placuit ergo, pr√¶sente spiritu sancto et angelis eius" (see
   Mansi, Collect. Concil. II. p. 469, and Hefele, Conciliengesch. I. 2,
   p. 204); and Constantine wished to have its decision regarded as
   "c√¶leste iudicium": this judgment by priests was to have the same
   honour as if it had been pronounced by the Lord himself (Mansi, 1.c. p.
   478). For the rest, we may here recall the fact that he hiera sunodos
   had long been a technical term in common use among the Greeks (see also
   "holy senate" in Justin). On the origin of the ecclesiastical Synods
   see Sohm's excellent discussions in Kirchenrecht. I. p. 247 ff.

   [449] This is now almost universally admitted; yet the idea was
   introduced by the great Oriental Synods in the cases of Novatian and
   Paul of Samosata, as well as by the Synod of Arles already indeed
   summoned by Constantine. The latter has been looked on in the West as a
   General Council for more than a century, and can also be regarded as
   such in many respects. On the Councils see Hatch's fine lecture in his
   book "The Social Constitution of Christian Churches," p. 172 f.

   [450] See Constantine's letter to the Bishops after the Council of
   Nic√¶a (in Theodoret H. E. I. 9 fin): "Whatever is determined in the
   holy assemblies of the Bishops, may be attributed to the divine will."
   Further, Socrates H. E. I. 9, who contrasts the recognition by the
   Emperor of the divine character of the Synod, with the aspersions of
   Sabinus the Macedonian.

   [451] The orthodox party made use of the advantage presented by the
   decision of a Synod which none could refuse to recognise as a wholly
   extraordinary event. On the other hand, nothing but such an event could
   atone for the unusual forms given to the creed, and thus attest a new
   theory. For in spite of everything which it had been hitherto possible
   to relate of Synods being under divine leadership, it was a novelty to
   raise the decision of a Synod to the level of an authority above
   discussion. Of such a thing even Bishop Julius of Rome, e.g., knew
   nothing. And it was all the more startling when the decision was
   supported neither by the letter of Scripture, nor a clear tradition,
   nor even an analogy of any sort. But this very fact promoted the
   assumption of an absolute authority,--though not yet in the case of
   Athanasius (see Gwatkin, Stud. of Arianism, p. 50); a virtue was made
   of necessity. With the first victory over Arianism, the view arose that
   the dogma of the Trinity was a certain truth because it had been
   affirmed at Nic√¶a by 318 Bishops inspired by the Holy Ghost--thus the
   Cappadocians, Cyril of Alex. etc. It is, however, extremely
   paradoxical, that even up to the middle of the fourth century the
   Eusebians laid greater stress on the authority of Synodical decisions
   than the orthodox party. In order to get the West to accept the
   deposition of Athanasius, they continued to appeal to their Antiochene
   Synod, and declared its decisions to be irreversible. Although their
   tactics compelled them also to admit the validity of the Nicene Creed,
   they did so in the hope that after the removal of Athanasius they would
   be able to carry an interpretation of it suitable to their own views.

   [452] The latter fact is admitted also by Hefele (1. c. Vol. I., p. 3).
   Besides, nothing could be more incorrect than the opinion that the
   distinction between OEcumenical and other Synods, as regards dogmatics,
   was established soon after the Nicene Council. The greatest variety of
   opinion prevailed till past the middle of the fifth century as to what
   Synods were OEcumenical and might be ranked along with the Nicene.
   Gregory of Nazianzus we know, e.g., to have spoken very contemptuously
   of the Constantinopolitan Synod, and, indeed, of Synods in general.
   Conversely, a certain authority was still ascribed to Provincial Synods
   in dogmatic questions. Further, there is a passage in Augustine which
   infers not only a relatively binding authority on the part of
   Provincial Councils, but also uncertainty as to the absolute authority
   of General Councils. The passage is extraordinarily characteristic of
   the unsteadiness of the whole structure of tradition. Meanwhile Reuter
   (Zeitschr. f. K.-Gesch. VIII. p. 167, 173, 176, 186) has rightly
   decided that we must keep steadily in view the special circumstances
   under which Augustine has here written; De bap. c. Donat. II. 3, 4:
   "Quis nesciat sanctam scripturam canonicam tam veteris quam novi
   testamenti certis suis terminis contineri, eamque omnibus posterioribus
   episcoporum litteris ita pr√¶poni, ut de illa omnino dubitari et
   disceptari non possit, utrum verum vel utrum rectum sit, quidquid in ea
   scriptum esse constiterit: episcoporum autem litteras qu√¶ post
   confirmatum canonem vel script√¶ sunt vel scribuntur, et per sermonem
   forte sapientiorem cuiuslibet in ea re peritioris, et per aliorum
   episcoporum graviorem auctoritatem doctioremque prudentiam et per
   concilia licere reprehendi, si quid in eis forte a veritate deviatum
   est: et ipsa concilia qu√¶ per singulas regiones vel provincias fiunt,
   plenariorum conciliorum auctoritati qu√¶ fiunt ex universo orbe
   Christiano, sine ullis ambagibus cedere: ipsaque plenaria s√¶pe priora
   posterioribus emendari, cum aliquo experimento rerum aperitur quod
   clausum erat, et cognoscitur quod latebat." Emendari can only mean here
   actual emendation--not merely explanation, as Catholic historians of
   dogma have to assume. It is also worthy of note, that Augustine
   assigned OEcumenical rank to several Synods--e.g., that of Arles--which
   afterwards were not held to be OEcumenical. On the other hand, it is
   instructive that he himself did not, like the Orientals, regard the
   Nicene decree as the foundation of the doctrine of the Trinity; see
   Reuter's arguments on the relation of the work "De trinitate" to the
   Nicene Symbol, (Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. V. p. 375 ff.). The Council of
   Chalcedon first put an end to dubiety as to the number, and the
   authority, of OEcumenical Councils in the East (even at the Robber
   Synod, A.D. 449, only two had been recognised). Up till then the Nicene
   stood alone on an inaccessible height; moreover, in after times the
   uniqueness of this Council was still remembered, though others were
   added beside it. For the rest, Roman Bishops spoke very depreciatorily
   of, or even refused to recognise, many canons of later councils; so Leo
   I. of the third of Constantinople (Ep. 106 [al. 80]), to say nothing of
   the twenty-eighth of Chalcedon. But Leo did not recognise the second
   Council as legitimate. Even Felix III. and Gelasius knew only of three
   OEcumenical Councils. General Synods Leo I. declared to be inspired
   (see Ep. 114, 2, to the Bishops assembled at Chalcedon); but it is more
   than questionable whether he therefore held all their resolutions to be
   absolutely irreversible.

   [453] After the Council of Chalcedon, it was, above all, Justinian's
   legislation which confirmed and popularised, even in the West, the view
   that there had been four OEumenical Councils: see his edict on the
   Three Chapters, 131: Hoi hupo ton tessaron sunodon, ton en Nikaia kai
   Konstantinoupolei, en Epheso kai en Chalkedoni tithentes horoi nomon
   taxin echetosan kai ta dogmata auton hos hai theopneustoi timasthosan
   graphai, Accordingly, this development was inaugurated by Constantine
   and closed by Justinian. After him Gregory I. (Ep. L. I. 25) wrote:
   "Sicut sancti evangelii quattuor libros, sic quattuor concilia
   suscipere et venerari me fateor." But this very utterance proves that
   the West only slowly accepted this whole development; for Gregory
   leaves out of account the fifth OEcumenical Council held meanwhile.
   Again, the attitude of the North African Church in the sixth century
   proves that there the dubiety felt by Augustine had not yet been wholly
   overcome. But the attempts of the papal theologian Vincenzi to dispute
   the independent authority of the councils generally--even for the above
   date--are thoroughly biassed, and carried out with the most daring
   indifference to historical fact. See his "In St. Gregorii Nyss. et
   Origenis scripta et doctrinam nova defensio", 5 T., 1865 f. and "De
   processione spiritus s. ex patre et filio", 1878.

   [454] This is taught without any variation by the later so-called
   Symbols of the Greek Church and the most distinguished theologians up
   to the present day; see, e.g., Damalas, He orthodoxos pistis, Athens,
   1877, p. 3 ff.; oudeis pisteuei eis mian ekklesian ho me homologon hoti
   tas ekprosopousas tauten oikoumenikas sunodous to pneuma to agion
   hodegei eis pasan aletheian. kai hoti he ekklesia haute den dunatai na
   e alle para ten epokodomemenen epi tes mones henopoiou arches ton
   oikoumenikon sunodon; dioti he arche ton merikon hupochreotikon
   homologion, hen kathierosan hai loipai ekklesiai, estin he meter tes
   diaireseos . . . he promnemoneutheisa anagnorisis ton hepta
   oikoumenikon sunodon esti gegonos historikon, medemian pleon
   ekklesiastiken anapselaphesin epidechomenon. According to present Greek
   ideas, the whole period of the Councils belongs to the classical
   antiquity of the Church; this period has long run its course.

   [455] See as to this the introduction to my History of Ancient
   Christian Literature up to Eusebius, Vol. I. 1893.

   [456] Athanasius was not indeed so frequently quoted as one would
   believe. His works have been comparatively eclipsed by those of the
   Cappadocians, and the final statement arrived at in the East, A.D. 381,
   of the dogma of the Trinity was more favourable to them than to
   Athanasius. The Synod of Constantinople, A.D. 383, (see in loco)
   furnishes the first example of the authority of the Fathers being made
   decisive, and of the Scriptures themselves being ignored. But the
   attempt miscarried at the time.

   [457] To the "teachers" the predicate "Theopneustos" was also applied.
   Thus Athanasius writes (De incarn. verbi 56): Hai graphai men gar dia
   theologon andron para Theou elalethesan kai egraphesan. hemeis de para
   ton autais entunchanonton theopneuston didaskalon, ohi kai martures tes
   Christou theotetos gegonasi, mathontes metadidomen kai te se
   philomathia. Similarly, though very rhetorically, Arius in his Thalia
   (Athanas. Orat. c. Arian I. 5): kata pistin eklekton Theou, suneton
   Theou, paidon hagion, urthotomon, agion Theou pneuma labonton, tade
   emathon egoge hupo ton sophies metechonton, asteion, theodidakton, kata
   panta sophon te.

   [458] It would take us too far to give detailed instances of the points
   discussed under this head. We only emphasise the following. (1) The
   attestation of a doctrine by the Councils was often set side by side
   with that given by the "Fathers", the "ancient" or "holy doctors", in
   such a way that the former seemed often to be merely a special case of
   the latter. And this was quite natural. The Church possessed no
   continuous testimony in the Councils; from its distinctive character,
   however, it required one. And this could only be furnished by the
   unbroken chorus of orthodox doctors. Even taken historically this court
   of appeal was the older. Iren√¶us and especially Clemens Alex. had
   already referred to deceased presbyters as authoritative teachers; and
   Eusebius' conception of Church History embraced the idea--see preface
   and outline--that side by side with the successio episcoporum there
   stood a series of witnesses who, in uninterrupted succession, had
   declared the true doctrine orally and in writing. (2) No definitions
   were arrived at of the manner in which the authority of the Bishops was
   related to that of the doctors. It was possible to shut one's eyes to
   this question, because in most cases the teachers were also bishops. As
   a rule, the Greeks spoke not of bishops, but the ancient doctors, when
   appealing to the witnesses to the truth. It was otherwise with the
   majority of the Latins after Cyprian (see p. 214). (3) As the usual
   procedure at the Councils was to set up no doctrinal tenet unless it
   was believed to have the support of the doctors, and as the claim was
   made that this course should always be adopted, the idea that the
   Councils were inspired was already abolished, and they were
   subordinated to the continuous testimony of the Church (see under). (4)
   The practice of consulting authorities began at the Ephesian Council;
   it played a more prominent part in every succeeding Synod. Athanasius
   and the Arians had undoubtedly disputed before this over passages in
   the Fathers, but their disputes were of slight importance compared with
   those that took place afterwards. (5) The notion of ecclesiastical
   antiquity gradually became more and more comprehensive; meanwhile the
   real ancient period of Christianity became more obscure, and bit by bit
   came to be forgotten. After the seventh the whole period of the
   Councils was looked on as the classical antiquity of the Church. If
   even in the fourth, nay, up to the middle of the fifth century,
   Councils were held to be an innovation, their absence was now
   considered a characteristic of the age of the Epigoni; indeed they were
   thought to be unnecessary, because everything was already settled. (6)
   The opinion held by faith that the "Fathers" had decided every disputed
   point beforehand, was a strong challenge to produce forgeries, and
   resulted in objective and and subjective falsehood. Caspari (Alte und
   neue Quellen, etc., 1879) has shown that the followers of Apollinaris
   were the first to forge on a large scale; but the Acts of Councils, and
   the examination of writings circulated under the names of celebrated
   Fathers, show that they had numerous imitators in the ranks of all
   parties. The practice of compiling collections of extracts, which was
   so much favoured after the middle of the fifth century, was, besides,
   especially adapted to conceal forgeries or inaccuracies. (7) But the
   limits, authority, and character of the Court of Appeal of the
   "Fathers" were never determined. It was taught that the orthodox
   Fathers agreed in all matters, nay, this theory was treated as a dogma.
   Stephen Gobarus' attempt (Photius, Cod.232) to demonstrate the
   contradictions of the Fathers was felt to be profane, just as Eusebius
   had condemned as unchurchmanlike the attitude of Marcellus of Ancyra,
   who had censured the consultation, without independent examination, of
   the "wisest" Fathers. But even John of Damascus had to admit that
   Fathers--otherwise orthodox--held divergent opinions on single points
   (De imag. I. 25), and Photius actually was more than once compelled, in
   the course of his learned studies, to notice mistakes committed by them
   (see his Bibliotheca). Therefore the question was never decided who
   constituted the orthodox Fathers. It became the custom to prefer
   (Athanasius), Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom, Cyril, and afterwards
   also John of Damascus. In the fourth century the orthodox were much
   troubled by the fact that the Synod of Antioch (A.D. 268) rejected,
   while that of Nic√¶a accepted, the term Homoousios. The treatment of
   this difficulty in Athanasius, "De synod." 43 sq., shows that no one
   had hit on the idea that the later decision made the earlier obsolete.
   It was rather held on the contrary: hoi prolabontes aphanizousin tous
   meta tauta genoemnous. Therefore Athanasius sought and found evidences
   of the word Homoousios before the Samosatian controversy. Ultimately,
   however, he had to adopt a different treatment of the whole question,
   i.e., to show that Homoousios had only been rejected at Antioch as
   against Paul, in order not to admit a contradiction in the chorus of
   the Fathers. The same difficulty was caused about the middle of the
   fifth century by the term "duo phuseis;", for it was hard to find an
   instance of that in antiquity. Of Eutyches the following expression is
   recorded (Mansi VI., p. 700): to ek duo phuseon henotheison kath'
   hupostasin gegennesthai ton kurion hemon Iesoun Christon mete
   memathekenai en tais ekthesesi ton hagion pateron mete katadechesthai,
   ei tuchoi ti auto toiouto para tinos hupanaginoskesthai, dia to tas
   theias graphas ameinonas einai tes ton pateron didaskalias. He
   afterwards disowned this expression as being distorted, his advocate
   corrected it in his name thus: "The Fathers have spoken in different
   ways, and I accept everything they say, but not as a rule of faith"
   (eis kanona de pisteos). That is very instructive. The words excited
   the greatest consternation in the assembly in which they were uttered,
   and the speaker felt himself compelled at once to excuse them on the
   ground of a momentary confusion.

   [459] See above, Note 1, p. 198, and compare "De peccator. mer. et
   remiss." I., 50. Here the auctoritas ecclesiarum orientalium is
   mentioned (in reference to the Ep. to the Hebrews), and to Augustine
   this auctoritas was exalted, because Christianity had come from the
   Apostolic Churches, from the communities to which John and Paul had
   written, above all, from Jerusalem (unde ipsum evangelium coepit
   pr√¶dicari). The fact that the Donatists had been separated from
   Apostolic Churches proved to him that they were wrong; see especially
   the Liber ad Donat. post collat. c. 4, c. 29; also Ep. 52, c. 3 and c.
   Lib. Petil. l. II., c. 51 (Reuter in the Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. V., p.
   361 ff.). Optatus had already held the same view as Augustine; see the
   important details "De schism. Donat." II., 6, VI., 3. But even after
   the middle of the sixth century a Roman Pope, Pelagius I., singled out
   the fact in praise of Augustine, that he, "mindful of the divine
   teaching which founded the Church on the Apostolic Chairs, taught that
   those were schismatics who seceded from the doctrine and communion of
   these Apostolic Chairs" (Mansi, Concil. IX., p. 716). Pelagius even
   declared that when doubts as to the faith arose it was necessary to
   conform to the Apostolic Chairs (l. c. p. 732). This form of expression
   is all the more remarkable since the Roman Bishops of the fifth century
   spoke, as a rule, as if the designation sedes apostolica belonged
   peculiarly to their Chair.

   [460] At the transition from the fourth to the fifth century; see
   Hefele II., pp. 77 ff., 495 f., 528 ff.

   [461] See the 7th Canon of Nic√¶a, and in addition, Hefele's details,
   Vol. I., p. 403 f.; II., p. 213, Jerusalem was first raised to a
   Patriarchate at Chalcedon, see Hefele II., pp. 477, 502. Jerusalem
   became once more the holy city' in the fourth century; see Epiphanius
   and others.

   [462] See the 3rd Canon of Constantinople, Hefele, II., p. 17 f. and
   the 28th of Chalcedon, Hefele, II., p. 527 f.; to throno tes
   presbuteras Rhomes dia to basileuein ten polin ekeinen, hoi pateres

   Constantinople was factitiously promoted to the place of Ephesus by
   reason of this unexampled act of legitimation. At the Robber Synod,
   nevertheless, it still held the fifth place. As regards the historical
   interpretation of the sixth Canon of Nic√¶a and the third of
   Constantinople, I agree substantially with the excellent arguments of
   Kattenbusch (l. c. I., p. 81 ff.); only it must be still more strongly
   emphasised that the Canons of A.D. 381 bore a clearly marked hostility
   to Alexandria. Even then it was considered necessary to suppress the
   authority of the Alexandrian Church, which was on the point of
   developing into the premier Church of the East.

   [463] An energetic protest was admittedly raised, especially by Leo I.
   and his successors. Leo at the same time also advocated the rights of
   the Apostolic Churches in general (Ep. 106). We cannot here follow out
   the controversy, although it reflects the revivification of the
   Byzantine Church and State, and the attitude of the Roman Bishops,
   which was purely ecclesiastical, though it did rest on fictions: see
   Hefele II., pp. 408, 539 ff., 549 ff., and Sohm l. c. I., pp. 377-440.
   It was not until the fourth Lateran Synod (Can. 5), when a Latin
   Patriachate existed at Constantinople (1215), that Rome recognised the
   28th Canon of Chalcedon.

   [464] Although all Bishops were held to be successors of the Apostles,
   yet Leo I. singles out very distinctly those who had inherited the
   chairs of the Apostles; see his letter to the Emperor Marcian (Ep.
   104).

   [465] Not only Eusebius, but also Theodore of Mopsuestia had read
   Cyprian's Epistles. At the Council of Ephesus evidence taken from him
   was read; see Vincent, Commonit. 42. Of the Westerns, after Cyprian,
   Ambrose was especially esteemed in the East. Augustine also possessed a
   certain authority.

   [466] See Vol. II., p. 149 f.

   [467] On the authority of the Roman Bishop in the fourth century, see
   Hauck, Der r√∂mische Bischop in 4 Jahrh., 1881; Rade, Damasus, 1881;
   Langen, Gesch. der r√∂mischen Kirche, 2 Vol., 1881, 1885; Sohm, l. c. In
   what follows we only discuss Rome's prestige in the East. Even Hefele
   (l. c. I., p. 8) admits that the first eight Synods were not appointed
   and convoked by the Roman Bishops. His arguments as to the presidency
   at the Synods are, however, biassed (pp. 29-44). It was at Chalcedon
   that the legates of the Roman Bishop first occupied a special position.
   The sixth Canon of Nic√¶a, when correctly interpreted, gives no
   preference to Rome, but refers merely to the fact that it was the
   ecclesiastical metropolis for the Churches of several provinces. It is
   credible that Julius I. uttered the principle (Socrates H. E. II. 17):
   me dein para gnomen tou episkopou Rhomes kanonizein tas ekklesias. The
   peculiar authority of the Roman Chair showed itself in the fourth
   century in the following facts. First, Constantine transferred to the
   Roman Bishop the duty of presiding over the commission to examine the
   case of the Donatists. Secondly, the oppressed adherents of the Nicene
   Symbol in the East turned to him for protection (see even Langen, l. c.
   I., p. 425 f.). Thirdly, we have the request of the Eusebians that
   Julius should decide the dogmatic question; it is true that very
   soon--when they foresaw their defeat in Rome--they changed their tone.
   They still conceded a peculiar dignity to Rome; it does not seem to me
   possible to translate philotimian (Sozom. III. 8) with Langen by
   "ambition." Yet they pointed out that Rome had received its
   Christianity from the East, and that it was as little entitled to
   review the decision of a dogmatic question given in the East, as the
   Oriental Bishops would have been to take up the Novatian affair after
   Rome had spoken. (The letter is to be reconstructed from Sozom. III. 8,
   and Athanas. apolog. c. Arian. 25-35.) Fourthly, we have evidence of
   Rome's position also in Julius' epistle to the Orientals (Athanas. l.
   c.); fifthly, in Canons 3 and 5 of the Synod of Sardica; and sixthly,
   in the request of the Antiochenes, or Jerome, to Damasus, for a
   decision in the Antiochene schism (Ep. 16).

   [468] Damasus' policy did not at once succeed in raising the prestige
   of the Roman Chair in the East (see Rade, l. c., p, 137 f.), but the
   manner in which Theodosius I. at first decided the Arian controversy
   there, did. "Cunctos populos, quos clementi√¶ nostr√¶ regit
   temperamentum, in tali volumus religione versari, quam divinum Petrum
   atostolum tradidisse Romanis religio usque ad nunc ab ipso insinuata
   declarat," etc. Besides, the new style adopted by Damasus in his letter
   to the Oriental Bishops (Theodoret H. E. V. 10) was not without effect
   in the East. He calls them my "sons" instead of my "brethren," and he
   no longer speaks, like other Bishops, as commissioned by the
   Synod--though the question at issue was a decision of the Synod--or as
   representing the Western Church. On the contrary, he addresses them in
   virtue of the authority of his "Apostolic Chair," which he connects
   solely with Peter and without any reference to Paul. "The first rank is
   due to the Holy Church, in which the Holy Apostle had his seat, and
   taught how we should fitly guide the helm which we have undertaken to
   control." Rade has, besides, here rightly conjectured (p. 136) that
   Jerome had a share in this letter, which did a great deal to raise the
   influence of the Roman Chair in the East.

   [469] From and after Siricius I., the Roman Bishops maintained that it
   was their province to care for all Churches (Constant., p. 659. Ep. 6,
   ch. 1). On the relation of Leo I. to the East, and to the fourth
   Council, see Langen, l. c. II., pp. 10 f., 50 ff. The phrase "our
   fatherly solicitude" occurs frequently even in the letters of his
   predecessors to the East. The appeal of Cyril to Coelestine is very
   important in its bearing on the dignity of the Roman Chair; compare the
   language of the Roman legate at the Council of Ephesus (Mansi III., p.
   1279 sq.).

   [470] In the work "Der Papst und das Concil von Janus" (1869), p. 93,
   we find this passage. "In the writings of the doctors of the Greek
   Church, Eusebius, Athanasius, Basil the Great, the two Gregorys, and
   Epiphanius, not a word is to be found of peculiar prerogatives being
   assigned to a Roman Bishop. Chrysostom, the most prolific of the Greek
   Fathers, is absolutely silent on the point, and so also are the two
   Cyrils. Basil (Opp. ed. Bened. III. 301, Ep. 239 and 214) has expressed
   his contempt for the writings of the Popes in the strongest terms [in
   the affairs of Marcellus): these proud and conceited westerns, who
   would only fortify heresy'; even if their letters descended from
   heaven, he would not accept them." It is true that, seeing the now
   wide-spread view of the apostolic succession of all Bishops, the
   prestige of the Roman Bishop is hardly perceptible in the East at the
   beginning of the fourth century, and that he had to fight, i.e., to
   wrest for himself the position which had formerly belonged to the Roman
   Church. Therefore the testimonies to a special dignity being possessed
   by the Roman Bishops in the East in the fourth century are in fact
   comparatively scanty, But they are not wanting--see, e.g., Greg. Naz.,
   Carmen de vita sua T. II., p. 9, and Chrysostom, Ep. ad Innocent
   I.--and from A.D. 380 this dignity bulked more largely in the eyes of
   Orientals, though indeed, without receiving a definite and fixed
   meaning. Very characteristic in this respect are the Church Histories
   of Socrates and Sozomen, who on this point are free from partiality,
   and reflect the universal opinion. But it does not occur to them to
   doubt that the Roman Bishop had a special authority and a unique
   relation to the whole Church (see, e.g., Socrat. II. 8, 15, 17; Soz.
   III. 8; also Theodoret's letter to Leo I.). Instructive here are the
   collections of Leo Allatius and in the Innsbrucker Theol. Ztschr.,
   1877, p. 662 f.; see also three treatises by the Abb√© Martin: "Saint
   Pierre, sa venue et son martyre √† Rome," in the Rev. des quest.
   historiq., 1873 (principally from oriental sources); "S. Pierre et S.
   Paul dans l'√©glise Nestorienne," Paris, 1875; "S. Pierre et le
   Rationalisme devant les √©glises orientales," Amiens, 1876. These
   discussions, though in part uncritical, are very full of matter. Matt.
   XVI. 18, John XXI. 18, were undoubtedly never referred in the East to
   the primacy of Rome (see Janus, p. 97). Still in any case it is saying
   too little--even for the period about the year A.D. 380--to remark as
   Rade does (l. c., p. 137). To the Orientals the Bishop of Rome was like
   the rest, only, thanks to his situation, the natural representative of
   the Churches of the western half of the Empire, acting, as it were, as
   correspondent in the name of the Christians of the West.

   [471] The prestige of the Roman Bishop in the East was accordingly on
   the increase from the beginning of the fourth till the middle of the
   fifth century, remained at its height till about the time of Justinian,
   when, however, it lost its practical importance, and then, apart from
   the events about A.D. 680 and the next decades, slowly declined, yet
   without ever being wholly destroyed. The Roman Chair was now held to be
   schismatic; if not that, it would still have been the first.
   Undoubtedly there was a strong inclination in later times to oppose it
   by advancing the see of Jerusalem, the seat of James, but it was not
   possible to gain any confidence in the claim of the latter to the first
   place. See on the criticism of the papacy by the Greeks, Pichler,
   Gesch. der kirchl. Trennung zwischen Or. u. Occ., 1864; Hergenr√∂ther,
   Photius, 3 Vols. 1867 ff.; Gass, Symbolik, p. 216 ff.; Kattenbusch, l.
   c., pp. 79-124. It was a settled doctrine of the Church in the East,
   that the Church has no visible head.

   [472] The terms turannis and dunasteia are first used, so far as I
   know, in reference to Antioch, i.e., against Paul of Samos. (Eus. H. E.
   VII. 30), after Origen had already complained of the ambition of the
   Great Bishops. Socrates has expressed himself very frankly about this
   matter.

   [473] The importance of the four Patriarchs--of Constantinople,
   Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem--was celebrated here and there in
   lofty expressions; it was especially prominent in the later Symbols,
   so-called, of the Greek Church (see Gass, l. c., p. 222 f.). Their
   presence or that of their representative was even held to be absolutely
   necessary at an OEcumenical Synod; but not only was the extent of their
   authority never defined, but the essential equality of all Bishops was
   steadily maintained in the East; and the latest development of the
   Greek Church, i.e., its disruption into perfectly independent National
   Churches, has thrown overboard the whole Constitution of the
   Patriarchate', which in all ages was more a matter of assertion than
   reality. The Bishop of Alexandria, undoubtedly, nearly succeeded in
   becoming in the fifth century supreme Bishop of the East, but Leo and
   Pulcheria overthrew him. Kattenbusch (l. c. p. 357 ff.) furnishes
   further details as to the "five Patriarchs as symbolical figures." Has
   the Patriarchate of Rome come to an end in the view of the Greek
   Church? In the abstract, no; in the concrete, yes.

   [474] See above, p. 215 f. Augustine gives utterance to a very
   remarkable statement in De bapt. c. Donat. II., 4, 5: "Quomodo potuit
   ista res (the baptism by heretics), tantis altercationum nebulis
   involuta, ad plenarii concilii luculentam illustrationem
   confirmationemque perduci, nisi primo diutius per orbis terrarum
   regiones multis hinc atque hinc disputationibus et collationibus
   episcoporum pertractata constaret?" Accordingly, only a matter which
   had already become ripe for decision through frequent deliberations
   could be submitted to and decided by a Council.

   [475] The more common way of putting it in the East was that the writer
   in question had failed in the necessary "Akribeia" (exactness), i.e.,
   he could, and should, have done it better (see, above all, the views of
   Photius). But it was rarely admitted that the Church at the time
   referred to did not yet possess complete akribeia in dogma. But we have
   further to notice here that a distinction was still drawn both in East
   and West between questions of faith, in the strict sense of the term,
   and theological doctrines, and that unity in the former was alone
   demanded. But as this distinction was in itself obscure, since in fact
   questions of faith had been transformed into theological and scientific
   ones, so in the East it became more and more restricted, though it was
   never wholly effaced. Augustine, besides, still laid great stress on
   this distinction, and accepted a whole group of theological doctrines
   in which differences did not endanger unity; the passages are given in
   Reuter, Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. V., p. 363 ff. But if "faith" is itself a
   doctrine, where does it cease and the doctrine begin? Besides the
   excuse of want of accuracy, which, indeed, involves censure, that
   haplousteron gegraphenai was asserted. It involved no fault. Thus
   Athanasius writes (De Synod. 45) of the Fathers who in A.D. 268
   rejected the term Homoou'sios at Antioch: peri tes tou huiou theotetos
   haplousteron graphontes ou kategenonto peri tes tou homousiou
   akribeias. Precisely in the same way the Homoiousians at Nice excused
   the Nicene Fathers. Unique, so far as I know, is the statement of
   Gregory of Naz. (Orat. 31. 28), which is only explicable from the still
   wholly confused state of the doctrine of the Holy Ghost in his time.
   "As the O. T. declared the Father clearly, but the Son more vaguely, so
   the N. T. has revealed the Son, but only suggested the divinity of the
   Spirit" [compare the contentions of the Montanists]. "Now, however, the
   Spirit reigns among us, and makes himself more clearly known to us; for
   it was not advisable to proclaim the divinity of the Son, so long as
   that of the Father was not recognised, or to impose upon the former--if
   we may use such a bold expression--that of the Spirit, while it (viz.,
   the divinity of the Son) was not accepted." We may in this passage
   study the distinction between Gregory the theologian and Athanasius.

   [476] So, above all, Augustine, who excused Cyprian in this way, and
   further, set up the general rule that as long as no unequivocal
   decisions had been given in a question, the bond of unity was to be
   maintained among the dissentient Bishops (De bapt. c. Donat. II. 4, 5).
   Augustine thus admitted that ecclesiastical tradition did not at every
   moment solve all questions pending in the Church. The Donatist and
   Pelagian controversy roused Western theologians to reflect on
   tradition. One fruit of this reflection was the Commonitorium of
   Vincentius of Lerinum, unique, because it deals professedly with the
   question of tradition. The arguments are decisive of Western views, but
   the book did not extend its influence into the East; there the ideas
   about tradition remained characteristically indefinite. A short
   analysis of the Commonitorium is necessary. Let it be noticed that it
   is ultimately aimed at Augustine's doctrine of grace and
   predestination, but that a large part of the rules are taken from that
   theologian. After a preface, in which Vincentius remarks that he is
   only sketching out what he had received from the past, he sets side by
   side the two foundations of the faith, the divine law (Holy Scripture)
   and the tradition of the Catholic Church (1). The former is sufficient
   by itself, but it requires the latter for its correct explanation (2).
   The latter embraces what had been believed everywhere, at all times,
   and by all--or, at least, by almost all priests and doctors (3).
   Accordingly, the following criteria were to be applied: (a) When a
   section of the Church renounced the communion of the Catholic faith,
   the Christian followed the great communion; (b) when a heresy
   threatened danger to the whole Church, he held by antiquity, "which,
   certainly, could not now be seduced"; (c) when he came upon heresy in
   antiquity itself, in a few men, or in a city or province, he followed
   the decision of a General Council; (d) if no such Council had spoken,
   he examined and compared the orthodox doctors and retained what--not
   two, or three--but all, had alike taught clearly, frequently, and
   persistently, in one and the same sense (4). These rules are
   illustrated by reference to the dangers, which had threatened the
   Church from Donatism, Arianism, and the Anabaptists (5-10). At this
   point, however, it is conceded that orthodox teachers might have and
   had fallen into error on one point; nevertheless they were blessed, but
   hell received the Epigoni, who, in order to start a heresy, took hold
   of the writings of one or other of the ancients (as the Donatists did
   of Cyprian's) which were composed in obscure language, and which, owing
   to the obscurity prevailing in them, seemed to coincide with their
   teaching, so that the views brought forward by these heretics bore not
   to have been maintained for the first time and exclusively by them.
   Such people were like Ham in uncovering the shame of their father (11).
   After this excursus the author adduces proofs from Paul Epistles, that
   changes in the creed, in short, any kind of innovation, constituted the
   worst evil (12-14). In order to prove and tempt his own, God had
   permitted teachers belonging to the Church, and therefore not foisted
   in from without, to essay the setting up of new tenets in the Church;
   examples are taken from Nestorius, Photinus, and Apollinaris; their
   heresy is described, and contrasted with the true faith (15-22). But
   the greatest temptation of the Church was due to the innovations of
   Origen, who was so famous (23), and of the no less distinguished
   Tertullian (24). Here follows a detailed practical application; those
   who have been seduced by the great heretics should unlearn to their
   salvation, what they have learned to their destruction; they must
   apprehend as much of the doctrine of the Church as can be grasped by
   the mind, and believe what they cannot understand; all novelty is
   wickedness and folly; in making innovations ignorance cloaks itself
   under the scientific spirit', imbecility under enlightenment', darkness
   under light'. The pure science of the worship of God is only given in
   the Catholic, ancient, and harmonious tradition (25-27). Antiquity is
   really the thorough-going criterion of the truth. This is followed by
   the second part, which contains the most original matter. It opens with
   the question whether there is any progress in the Church of Christ in
   religion. This is answered in the affirmative; the progress is very
   great'; but it consists in deepening, not in altering. It is organic
   growth of knowledge both on the part of individuals and the Church
   (28). In order to illustrate this, use is made figuratively of the
   growth of the child and plants; religion is fortified with years,
   expanded with time, and developed more subtly with age; yet everything
   remains really what it was, no innovation takes place, for a single
   novelty would destroy everything (29-31). The Church is intent only on
   clearness, light, a more subtle differentiation and invigoration of
   doctrine. What then did it ever seek to attain by the decrees of
   Councils, except that simple belief should become more definite, supine
   preaching be rendered more urgent, and that a wholly indolent conduct
   of affairs should give place to a correspondingly anxious performance
   of duty? "Hoc inquam semper neque quidquam pr√¶terea, h√¶reticorum
   novitatibus excitata [that then is admitted], conciliorum suorum
   decretis catholica perfecit ecclesia, nisi ut quod prius a majoribus
   sola traditione susceperat, hoc deinde posteris etiam per scriptur√¶
   chirographum consignaret, magnam rerum summam paucis litteris
   comprehendendo et plerumque propter intelligenti√¶ lucem non novum fidei
   sensum nov√¶ appellationis proprietate signando" (32). As compared with
   this admission, the author attacks all the more vigorously the wicked
   verbal innovations' practised by all heretics (33, 34). But it was
   still more necessary to be on one's guard when heretics appealed to
   Scripture--as e.g., the Arians did to predicates taken from the Bible
   against the term Homoousios--for they were the real wolves in sheeps'
   clothing, sons of the devil, for the devil also quoted the Bible
   (35-37). All that was necessary to meet their exposition and obtain the
   correct sense, was simply to apply the criteria given in ch. 4. (38).
   The last of these was the search for the concordant views of many and
   great teachers, when a Council had not yet decided the question
   concerned. Then follows a particular instruction which betrays very
   clearly the uncertainty of that citerion. It was to be applied, not to
   every unimportant question, but only, at least for the most part only,
   in the case of the rule of faith; it was, further, only to be used when
   heresies had just arisen, "before they had time to falsify the
   standards of the ancient creed, before they could by a wider diffusion
   of the poison adulterate the writings of the forefathers. Heresies
   already circulated and deeply rooted were not to be attacked in this
   way, because in the long lapse of time they had had sufficient
   opportunity to purloin the truth" (!!). Christians must try to refute
   these ancient heresies by the authority of Scripture alone--accordingly
   the principle of tradition is declared insolvent; or they must simply
   be avoided as having been already condemned. But even the principle of
   the consensus of the teachers is to be used with the greatest caution;
   it is strictly guarded; it is only of weight when, as it were, a whole
   Council of doctors can be cited (39). But in that case no one is
   entitled to disregard it, for the ancient doctors are the prophets and
   teachers' ranked by Paul next to the Apostles, and described by him as
   presented to the Church by God. He who despises them despises God. We
   must cling to the agreement of the holy Churches, which are holy
   because they continue in the communion of the faith (40). In the
   so-called second Commonitorium (ch. 41-43) there is first a
   recapitulation in which the sufficiency of Scripture as source of truth
   is once more emphasised. It is then shown that, at the Council of
   Ephesus held three years before, no novelty was proposed, but decisions
   were based on the sayings of the Fathers. The Fathers are named singly
   whose works were publicly read there (42). Vincentius therefore
   considered that the authority of the Council consisted wholly in its
   strict adherence to the testimony of tradition. In the last chapter
   statements follow to the same effect by the two last Roman Bishops. The
   authority of the Roman Chair is appended that nothing may seem wanting
   to completeness'. Perhaps the most notable feature in the whole of
   Vincentius' exposition is that the Bishops as such--apart from the
   Council--play absolutely no part, and that, in particular, no reference
   is made to their Apostolic succession as sharing in the proof of
   doctrine. The ancient "teachers" are the court of appeal. We see that
   Cyprian's influence was not so far-reaching, even in the West, as one
   should have supposed. The proof of tradition was not really based on
   the hierarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3. The Church. [477]

   Cyril of Jerusalem in his Catechisms portrays the Church to his
   disciples as a spiritual communion. But in explaining the predicate
   catholic' [478] he completely identifies this spiritual communion with
   the empirical Church. It is called Ekklesia, because it summons all men
   together, and unites them with one another. This it does at God's
   command; for after God had rejected the first community as the
   synagogue of the wicked', because they had crucified the Saviour, he
   built out of the heathen a second Church, on which his favour rests;
   that is the Church. of the living God, pillar and foundation of the
   truth. To it alone belong the predicates one, holy, and catholic; the
   communities of the Marcionites, Manich√¶ans, and other heretics. are
   societies of godlessness. The Church, which was formerly barren, is the
   mother of us all; she is the Bride of Christ. In this second Church God
   has appointed Apostles, Prophets, and teachers, and miraculous gifts of
   every kind; he has adorned it with all virtues, proved it to be
   unconquerable in persecution, and made it an object of veneration even
   to kings, since its boundaries are wider than those of any secular
   kingdom. It is called Catholic because it extends over the whole globe,
   teaches all necessary dogmas to men universally and unceasingly,
   comprehends and leads to the true worship of God all men without
   respect of class, is able to cure all sins in soul and body, and
   possesses in its midst all virtues and all conceivable gifts of grace.
   [479]

   These utterances of Cyril concerning the Church contain the
   quintessence of all that has ever been said of it by the Greeks. [480]
   They have adorned it with all conceivable attributes, applying to it
   all the O. T. passages descriptive of the people of Israel. [481] They
   glorified it as the communion of faith and virtue, and as a rule clung
   to this description of it in their catechetical and homiletical
   teaching. [482] Indeed, their position was here so far archaic, that
   they either did not mention the organisation of the Church at all,
   or--what was even more significant--they named in this connection the
   Apostles, Prophets, teachers and the rest, in brief, the possessors and
   gifts of the Spirit (see above in Cyril). We find the same teaching
   even in John of Damascus, who in his great work on dogma has given no
   place at all to the Church, [483] and in the later so-called Symbols of
   the Greek Church. [484] The difficult question, which Origen first
   discussed, and which Augustine considered so thoroughly in his fight
   with Donatism--the question about the Church as corpus verum (the true
   body) and corpus permixtum (the mixed body)--was hardly touched on in
   the East. [485] When we read Greek statements as to the
   Church--statements, besides, which are altogether few in number--we not
   infrequently believe that we are living in the second century, nay,
   before the Gnostic controversy. We must not perceive in this attitude
   of the Greek Fathers any sign of exceptional maturity. It was
   prescribed to them, on the one hand, by natural theology, on the other,
   by the narrowness of their view of the task of the Church. Redemption
   through Christ applied in intention to the whole human race, which
   meanwhile was always simply conceived as the sum of all individuals. In
   its result, it was limited by the liberty of man to resist salvation
   through sin. The Church was really, therefore, nothing but the sum of
   all individual believers in heaven and upon earth. The view that the
   Church was the mother of believers, a divine creation, the body of
   Christ, was not properly carried out in dogma. Even the thought that
   Christ had so assumed human nature that all it experienced in him
   benefited mankind, was only applied--not to the Church--but to mankind
   as it existed, and the Eucharist itself did not help the Church to a
   special place in dogmatics. [486] In spite of the belief in one holy
   Catholic Church' (pisteuein eis mian hagian katholiken ekklesian) the
   Church was no dogmatic conception in the strict sense of the term. It
   did not form a link in the chain of the doctrines of redemption. And
   that is not surprising. Seeing the form given to the blessing of
   salvation, a religious conception of the Church could not be obtained.
   All was contained in the factors, God, mankind, Christ, the mysteries,
   and the individual.

   But occasion was given to draw up definitions of the Church by (1) the
   O. T. and the spurious Jewish Church, (2) heresy and the actual
   organisation of the Church, (3) the administration of the mysteries,
   (4) and the fight against the Roman claims to the primacy. As regards
   the first point, all that was necessary had been said in the second and
   third centuries; there was nothing to add; it was repeated with greater
   or less animosity to Judaism, whose history appeared sometimes as the
   mysterious type of the Church, sometimes as its antitype. As to the
   second and third, there was no doubt that the Church was the true
   teacher of the truth [487] and the legitimate administrator of the
   mysteries. [488] It transmitted the mathesis (learning) and it
   possessed the mysteries. Therefore--and of this there was no doubt--it
   was essential to her to have the organisation, which was crowned by
   Bishops and Councils, and priests who should present the sacrifices and
   judge in God's stead. Bishops and Councils we have spoken of above, the
   priests and their duties will be discussed in Chap. X. [489] It is
   remarkable, however, that the latter is brought more to the front than
   the former. The Pseudo-areopagite was not the first to make his view of
   the Church depend essentially on the mysteries, and to regard the
   hierarchy primarily as performers of the sacred rites; he only
   completed what Ignatius, Clement, the first draft of the Apostolic
   Constitutions, Chrysostom de sacerdotio, [490] and many others had
   developed before or contemporaneously with him. The Church had been
   entrusted to the Bishops, because they constituted the living
   representation of God on earth, the vicars of Christ, participators in
   the activity of the Holy Spirit, and therefore the source of all
   sacraments. They were much less thought of as successors of the
   Apostles; the Church was the legacy not of the Apostles, but of Christ,
   and the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. [491]

   In the polemic against the Roman claims to supremacy, the view was
   strongly emphasised that Christ is the foundation and sole head of the
   Church, and this principle was opposed even to an exaggerated estimate
   of the Apostles in general and Peter in particular.

   "He who secedes from the Church, withdraws himself at the same time
   from the influences of the Holy Spirit, and it is not easy to find a
   wise man among the heretics"; [492] but on what points the unity of the
   Church was based has not been made clear. It first appears as if faith
   and virtue were sufficient, but participation in the mysteries of the
   Church, and submission to its organisation and tradition were added:
   indeed these in practice took the first place. Yet the organisation of
   the Church was not really carried higher than the Bishops, in spite of
   all the empty words used about the Patriarchs: the Church was orthodox
   and perfect, because it offered a security in its episcopal and
   priestly constitution that it was the ancient institution founded by
   Christ. In this conviction--we can hardly call it a doctrine--the
   Church became more and more narrow; it made itself a holy piece of
   antiquity. [493]

   But after the close of the fifth century it ceased to be the one
   Church. Tradition, which had been created to maintain the unity of the
   Church, served in the end to split it up, because national and local
   traditions, views, and customs had been received into it to an
   increasing extent. The great cleavage into Catholic and Novatian
   Catholic was not yet determined, or supported by national
   considerations. The division into Gr√¶co-Roman Catholicism and Germanic
   Arianism did owe its duration to opposite national tendencies. On the
   other hand, the disruption of the Eastern Church into the Byzantine
   (Roman) and the Oriental (Nestorian-Syrian, Jacobitish-Syrian, Coptic,
   and Armenian) rested entirely on national antitheses, and, preserved
   mainly by the monks who, in spite of all their renunciation of the
   world, have always adopted a National Church attitude, has continued up
   to the present day. Now, after the schism had further taken place
   between the Byzantine (Neo-Roman) and the Roman branches, the Church
   was divided into three (four) great territories distinguished by their
   nationality: the Germano-Roman West (Rome), the countries on the √Ügean
   sea (Constantinople), and the East split into Nestorianism and
   Monophysitism. Each had its own peculiar traditions and authorities.
   The Orientals, though rent asunder and quarrelling with each other,
   felt that they formed a unity compared with the two other sections,
   i.e., the "Romans," and could, in reply to the "bragging of the
   Romans," point to a hundred marks which revealed the superiority of
   their Churches. They regarded their land as the cradle of the human
   race, their Church as the primitive home of religion; and if Jerusalem
   was no longer in their possession, yet they still had the ancient site
   of Paradise. [494] The Neo-Romans boasted of their Patriarchate, their
   unchanged faith, and their nation, which took no part in the
   crucifixion of Christ, in which the Romans and Barbarians had made
   common cause. The Romans, finally, had the chiefs of the Apostles,
   Peter and Paul, and the Pope, Peter's successor, with the secular power
   committed to him by Christ and Constantine. The common foundation of
   these Churches was not solid enough to resist the elements that were
   dissolving it. Nationality was stronger than religion.

   [477] Compare the statements of Kattenbusch, l. c., p. 330 ff. The East
   never arrived at a definite theory of the nature and features of the
   Church.

   [478] On this attribute see Vol. II., p, 75. n. 1. From the middle of
   the fourth century the clause "kai [eis] mian agian katholiken
   ekklesian" must have stood in the Symbols of by far the most of the
   provincial Churches in the East. The eis is to be referred also to the
   Church.

   [479] Cyril, Cat. XVIII., ch. 22-27

   [480] For Western doctrines of the Church see the next book. But they
   are not so different in theory from those of the East as some suppose.

   [481] The Greeks spoke not infrequently of the "state" or "city" of
   God; Origen had already used the term, and it is common in Eusebius. On
   the other hand, the fine combination "Christ and the Church (as bride)"
   or "the Church as the body of Christ", which had been at a very early
   date reduced to the level of a homiletical or rhetorical view, was
   either thrust into the background, or superseded by the phrase "Christ
   and the individual soul." At a later date, the proposition, that Christ
   is the head of the Church, was often asserted against the Latins; but
   it was not very effective; for, seeing that the Greeks granted that the
   Church was a visible body in the common sense of the term, their thesis
   that this visible Church had none but an invisible head was beset with
   difficulties. Besides, Origen had been attacked as early as about A.D.
   300, because he had explained Adam and Eve as referring to Christ and
   the Church (Socrates H. E. III. 7), though this allegory was supported
   by a very ancient tradition. Tychonius repeated it.

   [482] There are very numerous instances of this, and most of all in the
   influential Chrysostom. Epiphanius' contention in the Expos. fid.
   cathol., ch. 3 is worthy of notice: Ho Theos, ho epi panton, hemin
   Theos huparchei tois ek tes hagias ekklesias gennetheisin. This Jewish
   Christian regarded the Church as Israel, and its God as the God of
   Israel; see what follows.

   [483] Langen, Joh. Damascenus, p. 299 f.

   [484] Gass, l. c., p. 205 f.

   [485] It is treated in the later Symbols; see Gass, p. 206 f.

   [486] Cyril of Alexandria frequently connects the Church with the
   incarnation and the Eucharist; but even he has not gone beyond the
   homiletic and edifying point of view.

   [487] Religious truth, however, really embraced all philosophy, see
   Anastasius Sin., Vi√¶ dux (Migne, Patrol., Vol. 89, p. 76 sq.):
   Horthodoxia estin apseudes peri Theou kai ktiseos hupolepsis e ennoia
   peri panton alethes, e doxa ton onton kathaper eisin.

   [488] Damalas has given a very pregnant summary of the old Patristic
   conception He orthodoxos pistis (1877) p. 3: he de pistis haute eis ten
   mian hagian katholiken kai apostoliken ekklesian esti pepoithesis, hoti
   haute estin ho phoreus tes theias charitos tes endeiknumenes eis duo
   tina, proton hoti haute estin ho alathastos didaskalos tes
   christianikes aletheias kai deuteron ho gnesios ton musterion
   oikonomos.

   [489] See Kattenbusch, l. c., pp. 346 ff., 357 ff., 393 ff.

   [490] See Vol. III. 4-6, VI. 4; also the Homily on the day of his
   ordination as priest, Montfaucon I., p. 436 sq.

   [491] Of course the Church was conscious of being, and called itself
   "apostolic." But it is perhaps not a mere accident that this predicate
   is not so stereotyped in the Symbols and other official manifestoes as
   the rest--unity, holiness and catholicity. The otherwise substantially
   identical expositions by the Greek Fathers of the word "catholic" have
   been collected by S√∂der, Der Begriff der Katholicit√§t der Kirche und
   des Glaubens (1881), pp. 95 ff., 110 ff., 113 f., 115 f. "Catholic" was
   equivalent to orthodox even before Eusebius, as is shown by the
   interpolations of the word into the Martyrium Polycarpi. That this word
   was interpolated I have tried to prove in "The Expositor," 1885, Dec.,
   p. 410 sq. It may be in place here to remark generally that the
   copyists are least to be trusted in the case of such predicates as were
   current at a later date--e.g., as regards words like "bearer of God"
   "Homoousios", "Catholic" etc. The Monophysites especially made great
   efforts to introduce their catch-words into older writers. Even to-day
   the Armenians are not to be trusted.

   [492] Heretics and Schismatics were more and more identified; see the
   so-called 6th Canon of Constantinople, A.D. 381 (it really dates from
   A.D. 382): hairetikous legomen tous te palai tes ekklesias
   apokeruchthentas kai tous meta tauta huph' hemon anathematisthentas.
   pros de toutois kai tous ten pistin men ten hugie prospoioumenous
   homologein, aposchisantas de kai antisunagontas tois kanonikois hemon
   episkopois.

   [493] The question whether the holiness of Christians was founded on
   being members in the Church--initiation into it--or depended on
   personal virtue was not decided in the East, but it was never even
   definitely put. The cause of this vagueness existed ultimately in the
   obscurity which prevailed among the Greeks in reference to the relation
   of natural theology and dogma in general; see on this the following
   chapters.

   [494] See, e.g., Elias of Nisibis, Proof of the truth of the faith (Ed.
   by Horst, 1886, p. 112 ff.).

   A.--Presuppositions of the Doctrine of Redemption, or Natural Theology.

   "Natural Theology" did not pass through any very thoroughgoing
   development in the Greek Church; but it reveals differences, according
   as Aristotelianism or Neoplatonism prevailed. By Natural Theology we
   are to understand the complex of conceptions that, according to the
   view then held, formed the self-evident and certain contents of the
   human mind, which was only held to be more or less darkened (see Chap.
   II.). These conceptions, however, arose in fact historically, and
   corresponded to the degree of culture at which the ancient world had
   arrived, especially through the work of the Greek Philosophers. We can
   divide them appropriately into doctrines concerning God and concerning
   man. But changes also took place in proportion to the growing influence
   exerted on these conceptions by the words of the Bible literally
   understood. Nevertheless the fundamental features remained in force;
   yet they were displaced and confused by foreign material during the
   period from Origen to John of Damascus.

   A.--PRESUPPOSITION OF DOCTRINE OF REDEMPTION OR NATURAL THEOLOGY.

CHAPTER IV.

  PRESUPPOSITIONS AND CONCEPTIONS REGARDING GOD, THE CREATOR, AS DISPENSER OF
  SALVATION.

   ¬ß 1. The Doctrine of God. Its Method.

   The main features of the doctrine of God were those familiar from the
   theology of the Apologists, as they were partly fixed and partly
   supplemented by the fight with Gnosticism. Speculations on the Deity as
   a Trinity (trias) modified but little the general doctrine of God (yet
   see attempts in Augustine, De trinitate); for the unity, simplicity,
   indivisibility, and unchangeableness of God were at the same time
   maintained most definitely: in other words, the Father alone was almost
   always. regarded as root of the Deity" (rhiza tes theotetos), where the
   Deity, in its essential being, was described in comparison with the
   world. The ultimate reason of this was that theology counted on a
   general intelligence for its general doctrine of God, and therefore had
   recourse to natural religion and theology, i.e., to the results of
   Greek philosophy. It was, indeed admitted by many Fathers (see esp.
   Athanasius, De incarn.) that men could know the Deity from creation
   only dimly, if at all; and that therefore the manifestation of God in
   Christ alone made it possible to recognise the nature of God as the
   undivided, spiritual and good Lord of the World. But, in fact, it was
   only a question of more or less as regards the natural knowledge of the
   spiritual and good God, the Creator. Other Fathers, especially those
   influenced by Aristotle, declared the knowledge of God in its whole
   extent to be innate (see Arnobius), or, a knowledge to be constantly
   tested by the observation of nature. No difference is here caused by
   the fact that some Fathers have described the existence of God and his
   distinctive nature as capable of proof, others, as incapable; for the
   latter only rejected the proof in so far as God could not be discovered
   by means of deduction from a prius. The psychological, cosmological,
   [495] and natural theological proofs were not despised by them in
   meeting Atheism, Polytheism, Manich√¶ism, etc. We already find in
   Augustine suggestions of an ontological proof. [496] All these
   evidences were, indeed, given subject to the proviso, that all
   knowledge of God must be traced back to God himself, that it became
   indistinct in proportion to man's alienation from God, and that the
   revelation of Scripture first rendered everything clear and certain.

   Further, it was expressly contended that God, as the infinite one, was,
   strictly speaking, incapable of being known, because his nature could
   not be described by any predicate. But this inscrutability, so far as
   represented in the avowal "whatever the creature is, that God is not,"
   was held--and with this the Neoplatonists were agreed--to be the
   valuable and true knowledge (Athan. ad monach. 2: "even if it is not
   possible to comprehend what God is, it is possible to say what he is
   not:" kai ei me dunaton katalabesthai ti esti Theos, alla dunaton
   eipein, ti ouk estin. [497] The revelation through the Logos only went
   beyond this in that it established this knowledge regarding the
   infinite Spirit and his inexpressible nature, and made it possible to
   perceive him in his likeness. [498] The Fathers influenced by
   Neoplatonism, however, assumed further that the contemplative ascetic,
   who was on the way to deification, could gain a direct vision of God in
   all his splendour, a conception which the Areopagite has combined with
   a scholastic theory of the knowableness of God by negation, eminence,
   causality. [499]

   ¬ß 2. The Doctrine of God's Nature and Attributes.

   The Being of God was immortal substance and was primarily defined--as
   already results from the method of knowing God--by affirming that he
   was without beginning or end, that he was a spirit and the supreme
   First Cause, all which predicates were proved in connection with the
   proofs of his existence. The deity is the pneumatic On which, because
   it is not the world, is supramundane, simply governing the world, the
   one, indivisible, imperishable, unchangeable, supremely good and
   impassive being, to which, in the strict sense, a real existence alone
   belongs: the Fathers influenced by Aristotelianism emphasised
   especially the spiritual power which determined its own aims and the
   causality of the deity. God is the intelligible reality and infinite
   reason. So far as it is maintained of this being (secundum hominem)
   that he is good, the predicate affirms nothing but that he is perfect,
   i.e., is completely self-sufficient and possesses blessedness in
   himself and therefore is not envious--see esp. Athanasius adv. pagan.,
   also the Catechisms of Cyril. But the goodness of the Deity was also
   established from the fact of the revelation of God, first from
   creation, and here meant that God, since he is the gracious one, willed
   that creatures should participate in his blessedness, and carried out
   his intention under all circumstances.

   Augustine broke through this natural conception of the goodness of God;
   for he understands by the Deity as summum bonum the power of love which
   takes hold of man, and leads him from worldliness and selfishness to
   peace and felicity. But even in Augustine this idea is intimately
   connected with the natural view.

   As regards the divine attributes, the Fathers sought, while speaking of
   such, to keep clear of the idea of a plurality in God, or conceptions
   of anything accidental. It is only for human thought that the absolute,
   perfect, homogeneous Being has attributes assigned to him, as varied
   representations of him in relation to the finite. The elevation above
   time and space presented itself as eternity and omnipresence; the
   latter attribute at the same time was the root of omniscience and
   omnipotence. Omnipotence was limited by the Fathers by two thoughts: it
   was circumscribed by the good will of God, and it left scope for human
   liberty. [500] Origen's thesis of the limitation of omniscience found
   no supporters in later times.

   From the goodness (perfection) of God [501] all conceivable ethical
   qualities were deduced. But they did not obtain their due significance,
   because the abstract idea that God was the requiter, i.e., rewarded the
   good and punished the wicked, formed, in spite of all Neoplatonic
   philosophy, the foundation of the whole conceptions of God, in so far
   as ethics were taken into account at all. This view, however, which was
   considered the "natural" one, readily became indifferent to the thought
   that men as God's creatures are dependent on him, that they are meant
   to form an inner unity, and that their life is conducted to a definite
   goal; in other words, it endangered the religious view of Christianity.
   It gave man complete independence in presence of God, and broke mankind
   up into a group of disconnected individuals. It descended from Judaism
   and the ancient world--the gods are just, because they reward and
   punish, the two facts being conceived in co√∂rdination. This view,
   further, was entitled to its place within the narrow horizon of the
   citizens of ancient communities, [502] but while it could not be
   omitted from Christianity, it required to be subordinated to a higher
   thought. Accordingly, significant tendencies to correct the prevalent
   system of thought were not wanting on the part of the Fathers. Origen
   had already tried to regard the righteousness of God as a form of his
   loving discipline; the conception that suffering is always bound up
   with penal justice, had undoubtedly something to do with this attempt.
   The continued fight with dualism--Manich√¶ism--constantly made it
   necessary to demonstrate that power, goodness, wisdom, and justice were
   combined in the Deity. [503] But in almost all the Fathers the
   attributes of goodness and justice stood asunder. We can see the reason
   of this in the fact that up to Augustine no serious effort was made to
   understand the goodness of God as moral holiness, and this failure was
   in turn due to the characteristic method of obtaining a knowledge of
   God, the attempt to rise to the Deity from the notion of the finite by
   means of sublimations. [504] The theory of God was beset at this most
   important point with uncertainties, nay, inconsistencies. He was at
   once the impassive Being (On) and the judge who requited actions [505]
   --the latter conception, further, not only including the co√∂rdination
   of goodness and justice, but also the superiority of the former to the
   latter. The Alexandrians had grasped at the expedient, following Philo,
   [506] of representing God as absolutely benevolent, but the Logos as
   the Just; this, however, was to confess despair of solving the problem,
   showing once more very clearly that men could not think without
   compunction (affectiones human√¶) of the (penal) justice of which at
   most the Logos was capable; and it is interesting as a counterpart to
   the opposite idea adopted in later times. [507] But we see even here,
   why the doctrine of redemption could not become one of atonement in the
   ancient Church. If the distinctive form in which redemption was
   accomplished was to be justified, and its intrinsic necessity to be
   proved, then there must not only exist, but speculation must be founded
   on, the conviction that God's saving purpose transcended the thought of
   requital, and that he was morally holy. But that is out of the question
   where the Fathers are concerned. [508]

   ¬ß 3. The Cosmology.

   The Cosmological and allied anthropological problems were treated by
   the Fathers--who formally used Gen. I.-III. as their text--with the
   whole apparatus of contemporary philosophy, in this way satisfying
   their scientific craving for a rational conception of the world. The
   systems are therefore very different in details; but on the whole they
   existed peaceably side by side, showing that the differences
   presupposed a measure of agreement, sufficient for the solidarity of
   the doctrinal structure.

   These differences were slightest in the Cosmology proper. The task set
   the theologians of the fourth century was to bring Origen's cosmology
   more into harmony with the demands of the rule of faith, to adapt it
   more closely to the account given in Gen. I., and to defeat the
   Manich√¶an Cosmology. After the last decades of the fourth century, the
   slow course of development was hastened by violent opposition to
   Origen's cosmology, and the view of the Church, held before Origen, was
   substantially restored, though now as a scientific theory. [509] Yet
   the conception of an upper world of spirits, related to the present
   world as its ideal and type, continued to exist, and ever threw its
   shadow on the latter. [510] On the other hand, the Trinitarian
   conflicts led to a precise distinction being drawn between creating,
   making, begetting, and emanating, and thus the notion of creation out
   of nothing now first received its strict impress. But Neoplatonic ideas
   of the origin of the world lasted till after the beginning of the fifth
   century, even in the case of some Bishops, and side by side with it the
   Manich√¶an conception of the world spread secretly and found adherents
   among the clergy themselves up to the middle of it. The following
   proposition may be regarded as containing the quintessence of the
   orthodox Fathers from the fifth century, and at the same time as the
   presupposition that gave scope to all their further speculations. It
   can be stated thus: God from eternity bore in his own mind the idea of
   the world. In free self-determination he, in order to prove his
   goodness, created by the Logos, who embraces all ideas, this world,
   which has had a beginning and will have an end, in six days out of
   nothing, in accordance with the pattern of an upper world created by
   him.

   The justification of divine providence and the production of Theodicies
   were called for by Manich√¶ism and fatalism on the one hand, and the
   great political catastrophes and calamities on the other. It was taught
   that God constantly remained close to his creation, preserving and
   governing it. With this, rational beings were looked upon in their
   numerical sum total as the peculiar objects of divine providence.
   Providence was also defended in opposition to the loose and unstable
   form in which earlier and contemporary monotheistic philosophers had
   avowed it; it was recognised in principle to be a power protecting also
   the individual creature. Yet here Christian theologians themselves did
   not arrive at complete certainty. It was admitted that providence was
   above human freedom in so far as it was maintained that neither that
   freedom nor the evil proceeding from it could hinder the divine
   intentions. But the belief in providence was not definitely connected
   with redemption by Christ or with the Church, for it was considered a
   selfevident presupposition of redemption and a piece of Natural
   Theology. Therefore it was also destitute of any strict object. The
   uncertainty of the ancient world as to the extent and method of
   providence had left its influence, [511] and empirical reflections on
   the objectlessness of certain institutions, or phenomena in the
   world--e.g., of vermin--could not be defeated by a view which had
   itself a naturalistic basis. Yet in proportion as the sure and real
   knowledge of God was only derived from the Christian religion, it was
   also recognised that faith in providence was first made certain through
   Christ, and that Christians were under the particular providence of
   God. [512] The problem of the theodicy was solved (1) by proving that
   the freedom of the creature was something appropriate and good, the
   possibility of wickedness and evil, however, being necessarily combined
   with it; (2) by denying to wickedness any reality in the higher sense
   of the term, since wickedness as it was separated from God, the
   principle of all being, was held to be not--being; [513] (3) by
   defending the mala poen√¶ or evil's fitting means of purification; and
   finally, (4) by representing temporal sufferings as indifferent to the
   soul. Some older Fathers, e.g., Lactantius, emphasised, besides, even
   the necessity of wickedness in the interest of moralism: without it
   virtue would be impossible. [514] But such opinions died out in the
   fight with Manich√¶ism. [515]

   In reference to the heavenly spirits which belonged to, and indeed
   formed, the upper world, the recognised Fathers were convinced of the
   following points. (1) They were created by God (see the Symb. Nic.).
   (2) They were endowed with freedom, but had no material bodies
   (engutata tou asomatou). (3) They had passed through a crisis after
   which a section had remained true to the good, while another had
   revolted. (4) The good spirits were instruments of the divine
   government of the world, their activity being useful and beneficial to
   men, even entering into the sacramental system by which grace was
   imparted. (5) The reality of wickedness in the world was to be
   attributed to the bad spirits, and especially to their head, the devil;
   they exercised an almost unbounded power on earth, not being able
   indeed to compel man, but only to induce him, to sin; they could also
   be scared away without fail by the name of Christ, the sign of the
   cross, and the Sacraments. [516] As regards the relation of the good
   angels to men, their superiority to men--in the present condition of
   the latter--was emphasised, but it was also taught on the other hand,
   that man after he was made perfect would be at least equal to them. The
   former position gave rise to a sort of angel-worship, which
   nevertheless in earlier times was no proper part of religion. The Synod
   of Laodicea, about A.D. 360, declared it in its thirty-fifth Canon to
   be idolatry. [517] And it was kept in check by the idea that Christ's
   work possessed also a mysterious significance for the upper world. But
   the polytheistic cravings of man constantly influenced religious ideas,
   and as the Deity was farther and farther removed from ordinary
   Christian people by speculation, there gradually arose, along with the
   thought of the intercession of the angels, [518] a worshipping of them,
   which was indeed only settled ecclesiastically at the seventh
   OEcumenical Synod (A.D. 787). There it was defined as adoration
   (proskunesis) in distinction from service (latreia). [519] Even Gregory
   I. had assigned the service of angels to the pre-christian stage of
   religion. The points of doctrine which we have above grouped together
   became the bases of a great number of very different conceptions, which
   grew up in opposition to Origen's doctrine, or under its influence, or
   in dependence on exegesis (esp. of Gen. VI.), or, lastly, as a result
   of reminiscences of Greek folk-lore and philosophy. Men speculated on
   the date of the creation of angels, and the method by which they were
   created, on their spirituality or higher corporeality, their
   functions--as guardian angels and genii, the manner in which the wicked
   angels fell, [520] the orders and divisions of angels, and much else.
   Here also the doctrine of Origen, which culminated in the restoration
   of the revolted spirits, was in the end expressly disowned. On the
   other hand, the Neoplatonic conception of spirits and their orders, or
   the Gnostic idea of the √Üons as interpreters of the divine, was more
   and more legitimised in the Church doctrine of angels, and was combined
   by the Areopagite with the mystic system of the illumination of the
   world, and the communication of the divine to the creaturely. It was a
   very old idea--see Hebrews and First Clement--that Christ was in Heaven
   the High Priest and head (prostates) of believers in the presence of
   God. Clement of Alex. had already worked out this conception, following
   Philo's model, to the effect that Christ, in conjunction with the
   angelic powers subject to him, conveyed to men the energies of the
   heavenly sphere; that he ever offered himself for men to the Father as
   a sacrifice without fire (thuma apuron); that the Holy Spirit along
   with the angels kept the heavenly and the earthly Church in constant
   contact. In short, the thought of a graded hierarchy in heaven, with
   heavenly sacrifices, intercessions, etc., as it also occurs among the
   Valentinians, lay on the confines of the Alexandrian's speculation.
   These thoughts are more fully matured in Origen: the sacrifice of
   Christ applied also to the celestials, and the upper world, brought
   into harmony, contributed to the redemption of the lower. They were
   confirmed by the Neoplatonic philosophy of religion. On the other hand,
   Ignatius conceived the governing body of the Church on earth as a
   hierarchy which represented the heavenly order, and put it in
   operation. The two ideas--the Son, the Holy Ghost and the angelic hosts
   on the one hand, and the earthly priesthood, on the other--only needed
   to be combined, and a new stage of ecclesiastical theosophy was
   reached. The Pseudo-areopagite was the first to gain it--after, indeed,
   it had been already suggested clearly enough by Clement of Alex.; see
   Strom. VI. 13, 107, and other passages. Clement makes three dwellings
   in heaven correspond on one side to the divisions of angels, and,
   again, to the threefold hierarchy on earth. On the spread of this form
   of theosophy among the Syrian Monophysite monks, see Frothingham,
   Stephen bar Sudaili, 1886.

   This whole conception was after all, indeed, nothing but a timid
   expression of the thought that the plan of creation itself, extending
   down from the deity to man, included the means of redemption, and that,
   as alienation from the deity was due to the existence of graduated
   creations, so, at the same time was the restoration to God. This
   conception, which contrasts abruptly with that of the Old Testament and
   Christianity, was compatible in principle neither with the idea of the
   creation, nor with the one historical redemption that took place once
   for all. It was Gnostic and Neoplatonic, i.e., pagan. This its
   character was simply disguised by the retention of the creation so far
   as words went, and by the substitution for the √Üons of Jesus Christ,
   the Holy Ghost, and angelic powers with Biblical names; and, further,
   of sacraments, sacrifices, and priests, whose existence and operations
   were derived from the work of Christ.

   The root of this whole conception is ultimately found in the notion
   that the Logos, who was identified with the Son of God, continued to be
   conceived as the abode and bearer of all the ideas from which the world
   was evolved. Even Athanasius was not in a position thoroughly to
   correct this view,--see Atzberger, Die Logoslehre des heiligen
   Athanasius, 1880, p. 138 ff. Consequently, even the most clear-sighted
   of the Fathers were helpless against speculations which deduced
   redemption from the Cosmology. And thus a new Church Theosophy arose. A
   fantastic pantheism was introduced which had been created by the
   barbarous theosophy of expiring antiquity. It harmonised excellently
   with the religious barbarism which satisfied itself in the crudest and
   most daring myths and legends; nay, it kindled into fresh life with it.
   The living God, apart from whom the Soul possesses nothing, and the
   fervour of the saint threatened meanwhile to disappear. And side by
   side, nay, in cordial agreement, with these fantastic speculations,
   there existed a prosaic worship of the letter.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [495] The influence of Aristotle is first conspicuous in Diodore of
   Tarsus, who reproduced independently the cosmological proof of
   Aristotle (see Photius, Biblioth. 223). From the sixth century it is
   evident in the majority of the Fathers, and especially John of
   Damascus. See De fide orthod. I. 3 (12): Everything perceptible by the
   senses, as also the higher world of spirits, is subject to change;
   therefore it must have had a beginning, and been created. There must
   accordingly exist a being who created it, and that is God. Two other
   proofs are found in John of Dam.

   [496] Augustine's line of argument was first to demonstrate rules of
   human thought, which accordingly transcended it. These rules--logical
   and ethical--he stated to be truths, their sum being the truth. This
   truth was a living power, accordingly it existed. Thus the way to the
   existence of God was given; see esp. De lib. arbitr. II. 3-15, but the
   thought is also suggested elsewhere in his writings, e.g., the
   Confessions.

   [497] In this the great majority of the Fathers were agreed. Augustine
   describes (De doctr. I. 6) the impossibility of declaring God, in a way
   that coincides word for word with the tenets of the Basilidians
   (Hippol., Philos. VII. 20). Augustine writes: "Diximusne aliquid et
   sonuimus aliquid dignum deo? Immo vero nihil me aliud quam dicere
   voluisse sentio; si autem dixi, non hoc est quod dicere volui. Hoc unde
   scio, pisi quia deus ineffabilis est, quod autem a me dictum est, si
   ineffabile esset, dictum non esset? Ac per hoc ne ineffabilis quidem
   dicendus est deus, quia et hoc cum dicitur, aliquid dicitur. Et fit
   nescio qu√¶ pugna verborum, quoniam si illud est ineffabile, quod dici
   non potest, non est ineffabile, quod vel ineffabile dici potest."
   Basilides: Esti gar, phesin, ekeino ouch haplos arreton, ho onomazetai;
   arreton goun auto kaloumen, ekeino de oude arreton; kai gar to oud'
   arreton ouk arreton onomazetai, alla esti, phesin, uperano pantos
   onomatos onomazomenou.. Men were therefore at the point already reached
   by Basilides' followers in the second century. Even Catechumens were
   taught this; see Cyril, Cat. VI., ch. 2: ou to ti esti Theos
   exegoumetha . . . en tois peri Theou megale gnosis to ten agnosian
   homologein. Similar teaching is very frequent in Plotinus. In the Vita
   Plot. of Porphyry, ch. 23, the supreme God is thus defined: ho Theos ho
   mete morphen mete tina idean echon, huper de noun kai pan to noeton
   hidrumenos.

   [498] The Dogmatics of John of Damascus begin with John I. 18, Matt.
   XI. 17, and 1 Cor. II. 11.

   [499] The striking contention of some disciples of Lucian (according to
   Philostorgius), and the most extreme Arians, Eunomius and A√´tius, but
   not Arius himself, that men could know the nature of God as well as God
   himself did, and as well as they knew themselves, is most closely
   connected with their Christology and their Aristotelianism. When the
   orthodox Fathers argued that the indescribable God could only be
   perceived in the Logos and through his work, and that God therefore
   would have been unknowable had not the Logos been his image, possessed
   of a like nature, those Arians had to meet the objection by emphasising
   even in the course of the christological controversy, the possibility
   of knowing God directly. In taking up this position they had of course
   to leave the nature of God out of the question, and to confine
   themselves to his will, as it had been clearly manifested in creation,
   and the preaching of the truth by the Logos. But this to them was no
   limitation; for they only attached importance in the first place to the
   knowledge of the divine will, and secondly to the renewed submission of
   men to the sovereignty of the divine will: (not to participation in the
   divine nature. unless in so far as that was already involved in the
   original equipment of man; see Socrates IV. 7; Epiph. H. LXXVI. 4, and
   the counter-observations of the Cappadocians). Their expositions are
   exceded by the Areopagite's completely Neoplatonic theology, from
   which, meanwhile, Augustine in one of his lines of thought was not far
   removed. The Areopagite already adopted the position that ruled for
   more than a thousand years, in which the contention that God--by reason
   of his splendour--was absolutely unknowable, was balanced by the
   mystical assumption of a sensuous, suprasensuous knowableness in virtue
   of the fusion of the mind of God with the mind of man. To him also we
   trace back the theology of affirmation and negation (kataphatic and
   apophatic)--the thing had, indeed, been very long in existence--i.e.,
   the method of making statements about God via eminenti√¶ and via
   negationis; see his Letters, the work, De divinis nominibus, and the
   beginning of the tractate, De mystica theologia. The importance of John
   of Damascus consists for posterity in his having united the Neoplatonic
   and Aristotelian elements in his doctrine of God; see De fide orthod.
   I. 1-4.

   [500] Along with all fatalism and astrology the Greek Fathers also
   unanimously rejected the idea that God's prescience acted as fate and
   was the first cause of human actions, or that prophecy controlled the
   course of events. It was rather taught that prescience was consequent
   to the event perceived beforehand. But Augustine was not perfectly
   satisfied with this idea. He deepened it through the thought that the
   sum of all that happened was before God in an eternal now.

   [501] But of this the saying of Gregory of Nyssa is true (peri psuch.
   k. anastas; Oehler, p. 92): Pantos agathou epekeina he theia phusis, to
   de agathon agatho philon pantos, dia touto heauten blepousa kai ho
   echei thelei kai ho thelei echei ouden ton exothen eis heauton
   dechomene. Exo de autes ouden, hoti me he kakia mone, hetis, kan
   paradoxon e, en to me einai to einai echei. ou gar alle tis esti kakias
   genesis, ei me he tou ontos steresis. To de kurios on he tou agathou
   phusis estin; ho oun en to honti ouk estin, en to me einai pantos
   estin.

   [502] See Leopold Schmidt, Die Ethik der alten Griechen, 2 Vols., 1882;
   further, Ritschl in the Th. L. Z. 1883, Col. 6 f.

   [503] These four attributes Gregory of Nyssa has particularised and
   sought to harmonise in his great Catechism.

   [504] This method, however, was by no means despised by Augustine
   himself.

   [505] The doctrine of God came in this form to the theologians of the
   middle ages. The nuances and inconsistencies of scholastic theology
   were caused by the necessity of alternating between the two ideas of
   God as the intelligible On and the Requiter. Some emphasised the one,
   others the other, more strongly. In certain doctrines only the former,
   in others only the latter conception, could be used.

   [506] See Bigg, The Christian Platonists of Alex. (1886), p. 12 f.

   [507] In this view--in the Middle Ages--God appears rather as the
   strictly Just, Christ as the "good"; but the idea of goodness had
   changed.

   [508] In the lower ranks of the communities, and among a few Oriental
   sects (Audians), anthropomorphic conceptions of God, the belief that he
   had a human shape, a body etc., held their ground. But they were
   retained also in some circles of monks (e.g., those of the Scetian
   Desert), and even by a few Bishops. From the close of the fourth
   century, with the hostility to Origen's spiritualism was combined
   active resistance to this opposite view (Sozom. VIII. 11). The Stoic
   notion of God's corporeality had scarcely a defender after Tertullian;
   for Lactantius' view of the "figura" and "affectus" of God is not
   Stoic, but belongs to popular realism. In general, much that was
   anthropomorphic was retained in Western theology along with the
   realistic eschatology, and that by theologians who cherished a
   colourless eclectic moralism. Very instructive is Augustine's
   confession (Confess. V. fin.; VI. 3) that it was the sermons of Ambrose
   that first delivered him from the prejudice that the Catholic Church
   taught that the Deity was fashioned like man. If we reflect how much
   Augustine had mingled with Catholic Christians before his conversion,
   and how much he had heard of the Church, we cannot suppose he was the
   only one guilty of this prejudice. We need only recall the "apocryphal"
   writings of the Byzantine age, which were read to an extraordinary
   extent, to see how strong were anthropomorphism and the conceptions of
   a magic God.

   [509] See Justinian's edict against Origen, and the fifth Synod of
   Constantinople, Hefele, Concil. Gesch. II. 21 p. 780-797; at an earlier
   date, the attacks of Theophilus and Jerome on Origen.

   [510] Origen held that the present world was only a place of punishment
   and purification. This view, which approximated very closely to the old
   Gnostic idea, was rejected; but the conception remained of an upper
   world of spirits, of which our world was the materialised copy. Where
   this conception was potent, a considerable part of the feeling which
   possessed Origen (after Plato) as he looked at our world must have
   endured. It was never wanting among the orthodox Fathers, and the
   Greeks of to-day have not lost it. "The world is a whole, but divided
   into two spheres of which the higher is the necessary prius and type of
   the lower": that is still the Greek view (see Gass, Symbolik, p. 143
   f.). "God first and by his mere thought evoked out of non-existence all
   heavenly powers to exhibit his glory, and this intelligible world
   (kosmos noeros) is the expression of undisturbed harmony and obedient
   service." Man belongs to both worlds. The conception, as expounded by
   the Areopagite and established by John of Damascus (De fide orthod. II
   2-12), that the world was created in successive stages, has not the
   importance of a dogma, but it has that of a wide-spread theologoumenon.
   It is Neoplatonic and Gnostic, and its publication and recognition show
   that the dissatisfaction felt by Origen with the account of the
   creation in Gen. I. was constantly shared by others. Men felt a living
   interest, not in the way plants, fishes, and birds came into being, but
   in the emanation of the spiritual from the Deity at the head of
   creation down to man. Therefore we have the kosmos noeros, the
   intelligible world, whose most characteristic feature consisted in its
   (3) gradations (diakosmeseis), which again fell into (three) orders,
   down to archangels and angels. (See Dionys. De divina hierarch. 6 sq.,
   and John of Damascus, l.c., ch. III: pasa he theologia tas ouranious
   ousias ennea kekleke. tautas ho Theios hierotelestes eis treis
   aphorizei triadikas diakosmeseis, Seraphim, Cherubim, thrones,
   dominions, powers, forces, principalities, archangels, and angels. We
   find a step in this direction as early as the App. Constit. VII. 35).
   In the creation, the system of spiritual powers was built from above
   downwards; while in sanctification by the mysteries, it was necessary
   to ascend the same series. The significant point was the union of the
   conception of creation with the system of the cultus, or, better, the
   scheme which embodied the idea of creation in accordance with the line
   of progress laid down for asceticism and sanctification. This was
   retained by Greek theology in spite of all its disavowal of Origen,
   Neoplatonism, and Gnosticism. But even in the region of the material,
   incomparably greater interest was taken in warmth, cold, moisture,
   drought, in fire, air, earth, and water, in the four vital humours,
   than in the childish elements which the O. T. narrative of creation
   takes into account. Yet the whole was included under the title of the
   work of the six days', and the allegories of Origen were, in theory,
   rejected. The exegesis of Gen. I. became the doctoral problem proper
   among the Greek Fathers. The most important wrote works on the
   Hexa√´meron; among them that of Johannes Philoponus is scientific. ally
   the most advanced (peri kosmopoiias); it is dependent, not on
   Platonism, but on Aristotle, though it also opposes the latter.

   [511] For this reason a startling casuistry is to be noticed here and
   there, and exceptions are laid down.

   [512] Degrees of providence were generally distinguished.

   [513] After Origen this Platonic proposition enjoyed the widest
   circulation: see esp. Athanasius and the Cappadocians; but the
   Antiochians held no other view. Augustine made use of it in a peculiar
   and characteristic way.

   [514] Lactant. Instit. div. II., ch. 8, 12; V., ch. 7.

   [515] See Vol. V ., for the extent and form in which Augustine held
   such views.

   [516] No doubt existed of the necessity of believing in heavenly
   spiritual beings. Origen counted this belief a doctrine of the Church
   (De princip. pr√¶f. 10). The points numbered in the text may be regarded
   as the quintessence of what obtained generally. But such an agreement
   only made its appearance in the sixth century. Until then this point
   was a centre of contention between a form of Biblical "realism," and
   the Origenistic, i.e., the Greek philosophical, view as to the world of
   spirits. The treatment of the question by the Areopagite, and its
   approval by the Church, constituted a triumph of Neoplatonic mysticism
   over Biblicism. But that tendencies which went still farther in this
   direction had not been wholly destroyed, was shown by the Hesychastic
   controversy of the fourteenth century, or the assumption of an
   uncreated divine light, which was not the nature of God, but a specific
   energy, different from himself, and which could be seen. (See
   Engelhardt in Illgen's Ztschr., 1838, Part I., p. 68 ff.; Gass, Die
   Mystik des Nik. Kabasilas, 1849, p. 1. ff., and in Herzog's R.-E., 2nd
   Ed.). The Logos, accordingly, no longer satisfied, or rather, as
   Scholasticism had placed the Logos under an embargo, piety sought for a
   new mediator. He was to accomplish what the Logos no longer did: he was
   to be a visible revelation of God, himself and yet not himself; for God
   himself was simply quiescent being; accordingly he himself was
   conceived and realised in the form of an energy that could be traced.
   The theory of the Areopagite was, however, not satisfactory in this
   respect; for while the spirits might doctrinally be regarded as created
   beings, they were perceived as divine forces, emanations, rays of the
   perfect light, conceivable by degrees by man, and bridging him nearer
   to the deity. We have here a great difference from the western
   conception; in the East the Platonic and Gnostic doctrine of √Üons had
   never been entirely abolished. In the West, while the gradation of
   angelic powers had been accepted, the pious impulse from which it
   originated had not.

   [517] There undoubtedly existed, even in the earliest time, a view
   which conjoined the angels with God, and thus made them also objects of
   worship, or, included them in the fides, quoe creditur. We may here
   perhaps recall even 1 Tim. V. 21: diamarturomai enopion tou Theou kai
   Christou Iesou kai ton eklekton angelon. We can at any rate refer to
   Justin., Apol I. 6: (We worship God) kai ton par' autou huion . . . kai
   ton ton allon hepomenon kai exomoioumenon hagathon angelon straton.
   Athenag. Suppl. 10, 24.

   [518] This thought is undoubtedly extremely ancient, but at the earlier
   date it only existed in the outer circle of the faith.

   [519] It had long--as early as the fourth century--been on the way; see
   the miraculous oratories of St. Michael; Sozom. II. 3, Theodoret on
   Coloss. T. III., p. 355 ff.

   [520] On the devil, "the prince of the ranks encircling the earth," see
   the exposition by John of Dam., De fide orthod. II. 4. The devil and
   the demons of their own free will turned away unnaturally from God.

CHAPTER V.

  PRESUPPOSITIONS AND CONCEPTIONS REGARDING MAN AS THE RECIPIENT OF SALVATION.

   ¬ß 1. Introductory.

   According to the ideas of the Fathers, the doctrines of the condition
   and destiny of man belonged to Natural Theology. This appears from the
   fact that, starting from their Cosmology, they all strove to ascertain,
   from the original state of man, the nature of Christian redemption, in
   other words, the state of perfection. At the same time the reservation
   held good, that we should receive more than we could think or expect,
   and, in fact, that which was expected, and was deduced from the
   religious and ethical value which man had come to put upon himself in
   the course of history, was only carried back into his original state.
   The following propositions contain everything that can be stated as
   embodying a common conviction and common presupposition of all further
   conceptions, which in this matter turned out very different, in
   accordance with the speculative and empirical studies of the Fathers,
   and the object of their investigations for the time. Man made in the
   image of God is a free self-determining being. He was endowed with
   reason by God, that he might decide for the good, and enjoy
   immortality. He has fallen short of this destiny by having voluntarily
   yielded and continuing to yield himself--under temptation, but not
   under compulsion--to sin, yet without having lost the possibility and
   power of a virtuous life, or the capacity for immortality. The
   possibility was strengthened and immortality restored and offered by
   the Christian revelation which came to the aid of the darkened reason
   with complete knowledge of God. Accordingly, knowledge decides between
   good and evil. Strictly taken, the will is morally nothing. On this
   basis very different views were possible. It was asked, first, what was
   original endowment, and what destiny, in the case of man; secondly, in
   connection with this, how much was to be claimed as human nature, and
   how much as a gift of grace originally bestowed; and thirdly, in
   keeping with the above, how far and how deep the consequences of sin
   extended. The question was put, in the fourth place, whether bare
   freedom constituted man's character, or whether it did not correspond
   to his nature to be good. Fifthly, the philosophical question as to the
   constitution of man was here introduced and answered in various ways
   [dichotomically, trichotomically, the extent and scope of the flesh
   (sarx) in human nature, in its relation to the spirit (pneuma) and to
   sin]. Sixthly, the relation of the creaturely spirit (pneuma) to the
   divine, in other words, the origin of the human spirit, was discussed.
   Seventhly, lastly, and above all, men possessed two sources of
   knowledge: the account in Genesis with a realistic exposition, which
   seemed to pour scorn on all "spiritual" conceptions, but had
   nevertheless to be respected; and the relative section from Origen's
   theology, which was felt to an increasing extent to be intolerable to
   the Church, and which yet expressed the scientific, religious
   conviction of the Fathers, in so far as their thought was scientific.
   Under such circumstances different conceptions, compromises of all
   sorts, necessarily arose; but hardly anywhere was an advance made in
   the end on the views already presented by Iren√¶us. In the latest
   results, as they are to be found in the Dogmatics of John of Damascus,
   there is much that is more realistic than in Iren√¶us, but on the whole
   a type of doctrine is obtained which is more inadequate and confused,
   and less valuable. In what follows we intend to enter in detail only
   into the most important points.

   ¬ß 2. The Anthropology.

   Since the end of the creation of the world was held to consist in the
   creation of rational beings, who could exhibit the image of God and
   share in his blessedness, it followed that the power of free
   self-determination and the capacity for immortality belonged to the
   notion of man, and that they were therefore regarded as inalienable.
   All the doctors of the Church, however, comprehended, in the idea of
   innate freedom, the conceptions of the rational and moral plan of man's
   nature as a whole, and they defined this natural disposition to be the
   power to know God's will accurately, to follow it, and thus to rise
   above nature. While it was left in doubt whether this whole natural
   plan implied that man possessed bare freedom or freedom directed to the
   good, it certainly characterised man as a spiritual being, and for that
   very reason as an image of God. Being such, man was independent as
   regards God. In other words, the fact that he was an "image" did not
   directly establish a lasting dependence on God, nor did it find
   expression in such a dependence. On the contrary, it established his
   freedom in relation to God, so that man, being independent, was now
   only subject to the law of God, i.e., to that dispensation in virtue of
   which he was either rewarded or punished according as he behaved. The
   connection with God was thus exhausted in the noble constitution of man
   fixed once for all, but was supremely valued and acutely felt as a gift
   of divine grace, in the comparison with irrational animals. Meanwhile,
   the Fathers differed from one another. Some--like Athanasius, see even
   Tatian--assigned to human nature, in the strictest sense of the term,
   only the creaturely and sensuous state of being, in respect of which
   man is perishable, and they described everything else as a gift of
   divine grace inherent in human nature. Others embraced in this nature
   the moral capacity, endowment of reason, and knowledge of God;--so the
   majority; and very strenuously John of Damascus who repeatedly
   characterises the good as the natural: see De fide orthod. II. 30, III.
   14. The third class, finally, included even immortality, as a
   possession and not merely as a destiny, among the natural attributes of
   the human soul. These distinctions, which, however, are not
   particularly important for dogmatics, since all ultimately held nature
   to be a gift of grace, and the gift of grace to be a natural provision,
   were due partly to the different psychological conceptions of the
   Fathers, partly to the standpoint from which they investigated the
   problems; they might--as e.g., Athanasius--start from the doctrine of
   redemption or depend on moral, or empirical philosophical
   considerations. In psychology, the only point settled was that the
   fundamental form of human nature was twofold, spiritual and corporeal.
   This conception existed even where the soul itself was represented as
   something corporeal, or as only "as nearly as possible incorporeal"
   (engutata tou asomatou). Very many Greek Fathers, however, followed the
   view of Plato and Origen, according to which man consists of spirit,
   body, and soul--the soul uniting the other two. Consistently carried
   out, this opinion constantly led them back to the conception of Origen
   (Philo) that the spirit in man alone constituted his true nature, that
   it had its own, even a pretemporal, history, that in itself it belonged
   to the supernatural and divine sphere, and that the body was only a
   prison which had to be stripped off before the spirit could present
   itself in its true being. In order to escape these consequences, which
   were already discredited in the controversy with Neoplatonism and
   Manich√¶ism, different methods were adopted. Among these occurred that
   already alluded to above, the conception of the spirit solely as a
   "superadded gift" (donum superadditum), a religious principle, to be
   found exclusively in the pious. But this expedient was seldom chosen;
   the whole question, so important and crucial, was rather stifled in a
   hundred questions of detail, tortured out of, or read into, the account
   in Genesis. The ever increasing restriction of the allegorical and
   spiritualising method of interpreting Gen. I. ff., led the Fathers
   nolens-volens to opinions remote from their scientific thought on
   religion The only passage in that account, moreover, which seemed to
   support the spiritualistic conception--"God breathed his own breath
   into man"--proved too much, and had therefore to be let alone. [521]
   Origen's idea, that the body was a prison of the soul, was contrasted
   with the other, also ancient, that man was rather a microcosm, having
   received parts from the two created worlds, the upper and under. [522]
   But this conception, the only one which contained a coherent theory of
   equal value formally with the doctrine of Origen, could not fail to
   remain a mere theory, for the ethics corresponding to it, or its
   ethical ideal, were not supported by the final aims of the dominant
   theology. When anthropological questions or the Biblical narrative were
   not directly taken into account, it becomes everywhere obvious, that
   the old Platonic antithesis of spirit and body was regarded by the
   Fathers as the antithesis between that which was precious and that
   which was to be mortified, and that the earthly and creaturely in man
   was felt to be a hampering barrier which was to be surmounted.
   Monachism and the eschatological prospect of deification are examples
   which show how thoroughly practical ideas and hopes were determined by
   the dualistic view, though its point had been blunted by the tenet of
   the resurrection of the body. Meanwhile the theoretical doctrines as to
   the nature of man continued to be beset by a profound inconsistency,
   and ultimately, in consequence of Biblicism, became aimless and barren.
   [523]

   Supplement.--The different psychological views of the Fathers are
   reflected in the various theories as to the origin of individual souls.
   The oldest of these was the traducian theory of Tertullian, which was
   also represented by a few Greeks--Gregory of Nyssa, Anastasius Sinaita.
   According to it the soul was begotten along with the body. Its extreme
   opposite was Origen's idea of pre-existence which had still many
   adherents in the fourth century, but fell more and more into discredit,
   until, finally, it was expressly condemned at the Synod of
   Constantinople, A. D. 553. According to this doctrine, all souls were
   created at once by God along with the upper world, and fell
   successively into the lower world, and into their bodies. The middle
   view--an expedient of perplexity--was the creatian which gradually
   gained ground all through the fourth century, and can be characterised
   as the most wide-spread, at least in the West, from the beginning of
   the fifth. It taught that God was ever creating souls and planting them
   in the embryos. The East contented itself with disowning Origen's
   theory. Augustine, the greatest theologian of the West, was unable to
   come to any fixed view regarding the origin of the soul.

   The different views of the Fathers are further reflected in the
   different conceptions of the image of God in man. Religious and moral
   speculation were to be harmonised at this point; for the former was,
   indeed, never wholly wanting. Apart from such theologians as saw the
   image of God, somehow or other, even in the human figure, almost all
   were convinced that it consisted in reason and freedom. But with this
   it was impossible to remain perfectly satisfied, since man was still
   able to break away from God, so as in fact to become unlike him, and to
   die. On the other hand, theologians were certain that goodness and
   moral purity never could be innate. In order to solve the problem,
   different methods were adopted. Some abandoned the premise that the
   possession of the divine image was inalienable, and maintained that as
   it resided in the spirit that had been bestowed it could be completely
   lost through sinful sensuousness. The spirit returned to God, and the
   man relapsed to the level of the beasts. But this solution seemed
   unsatisfactory, because it was necessary, in spite of it, to retain the
   freedom that still, under all circumstances, existed to choose the
   good. Accordingly, it was impossible to treat this theory with any real
   seriousness. Others saw the possession of the Divine image, resting on
   reason and freedom, in the destiny of man to virtue and immortality,
   yet without stating what change in that case was actually made by
   falling short of this destiny. The third section, finally,
   distinguished, after the example of Origen, between "image" (eikon) and
   "likeness" (homoiosis) and saw the former in the inalienable spiritual
   plan of man, the latter in moral similarity to God, which was, indeed,
   one always to be gained on the basis of natural endowments. The Fathers
   were unwilling, as this review shows, to rest content with the thought
   that the inalienable spiritual natural endowment of man constituted the
   divine image, but they found no means of getting beyond it. Their
   conception of moral goodness as the product of human freedom hindered
   them. All the more strongly did they emphasise and praise, as a kind of
   set-off, the goodness of God as Creator revealed in the natural
   constitution of man.

   The different views of the Fathers are finally reflected in their
   conception of the primitive state. Christianity restores man to his
   state of ideal perfection. This state must, however, have already
   existed in some form at the beginning, since God's creation is perfect,
   and Genesis teaches, that man when created was good, and in a condition
   of blessedness (Paradise). On the other hand, it could not have been
   perfect, since man's perfection could not be attained except through
   freedom. The problem resolves itself into a complete contradiction,
   which, indeed, was already clearly to be found in Iren√¶us: the original
   condition of man must coincide with the state of perfection, and yet it
   must only have been preliminary. The Fathers tried various ways of
   solving this crucial and insoluble difficulty, in which again the
   empirical and moral philosophical conception combined with a religious
   one. An attempt was made by very many Fathers to limit somewhat the
   blessedness of the Paradisaical state, or to give a form to their
   conceptions of it different in quality--fanciful and material--from
   that of their ideas of the final perfection; accordingly, it was
   explained--by Gregory of Nyssa--that God himself, looking to the Fall,
   had not ordained the Paradisaical state to be perfect. By some, again,
   the inconsistencies were glossed over, while others determined,
   following Origen, wholly to abandon the historical interpretation of
   the state in Paradise, and to construct independently a primitive state
   for themselves. The last method had the advantage, in combination with
   the assumption of the preexistence of souls, that it could transfer all
   men mystically into the original state. However, this radical solution
   conflicted too strongly with the letter of revelation, and the spirit
   of the Church tradition. It was rejected, and thus the problem remained
   in its obscurity. Therefore men contented themselves more and more with
   disregarding the main question: they set down incongruities side by
   side, and extracted separate points from the account in Genesis. To the
   latter belonged especially those which were believed to recommend
   virginity and asceticism, and to prove that these formed the mode of
   life (habitus) which corresponded to the true nature of man. Nor were
   opinions wanting that characterised asceticism as a salutary means of
   correcting the deterioration of the human state. "Asceticism and its
   toils were not invented to procure the virtue that comes from without,
   but to remove superinduced and unnatural vileness, just as we restore
   the natural brightness of iron by carefully removing the rust, which is
   not natural, but has come to it through negligence" (John of Damascus,
   De fide orth. III. 14).

   The principles of ethics were, as a rule, discussed in connection with
   the original state of man. But even in reference to the blessedness
   enjoyed in that state no clear conception was reached; for if man's
   distinctive nature was based on bare freedom, what sort of blessedness
   could there be for him? What could be bestowed on him which he did not
   possess already, or which, if bestowed, did not once more call in
   question the original possession? What could fall to his lot except an
   arbitrarily chosen reward? Again, as regards ethics, nothing certain
   could be established. While negative morality, asceticism, was
   conceived, as a rule, to be the natural and destined condition of man,
   yet an effort was made to construct an ideal of positive morality, in
   which the virtues of philosophy appeared in a rather superficial
   connection with those of religion. [524] Negative and positive morality
   each looked up, after all, to a different supreme good, in the one case
   immortality, in the other the loftiest virtue. Therefore they could not
   be combined. The assumption of works of supererogation, which the
   Christian could accomplish while remaining in the world, formed the
   bridge between the two ethical ideals, but one which it must be
   admitted, contributed to flight from the one sphere to the other,
   rather than their connection. All attacks on the theory that ascetic
   achievements were especially valuable and meritorious were regarded as
   the outcome of moral laxity, and it is certain that in many cases they
   actually were.

   ¬ß 3. Ethics. Sin.

   It was recognised by all the Fathers that the human race had turned
   from the good and thus degenerated from its origin, i.e.,--according to
   the view of the majority--from Adam. This universality of sin was
   throughout explained, not from an innate wicked power in man impelling
   him necessarily to sin, nor from matter in itself, still less from
   complicity on the part of the Deity. [525] Nor, on the other hand, was
   it as a rule ascribed to a direct inheritance of Adam's sin, for
   inherited sin is a contradiction in itself; Adam was the type, but not
   the ancestor, of sinners. The true explanation was found in the misuse
   of freedom, caused by the seductions of wicked demons, and the
   transmission of wicked customs. Along with this, the majority
   undoubtedly cherished the secret idea, which was not surmounted, that
   the incentive to revolt from God [526] came to a certain extent
   necessarily from the sensuous nature and creaturely infirmity of man,
   and resulted from his composite constitution, and his liability to
   death, whether that was acquired naturally or by transgression, or
   inherited. Decay and death were especially held to constitute an
   inducement to and cause of continuance in sin. With natural
   sensuousness the fate of death was conjoined. Both drove man from God.
   But in spite of this view the assumption was retained of unaltered
   freedom. If on the one hand stress was laid on sensuousness being a
   natural endowment of man, the unnaturalness of wickedness was
   emphasised on the other, and thus bare freedom received a closer
   relation to goodness, which, of course, was conceived as repressed by
   sin. The good was the natural, but, again, in view of man's
   sensuousness, unnatural evil was also natural to him. The essence of
   sin, since wickedness was held to be something purely negative, was
   universally seen in alienation from God, being and goodness; but all
   that this meant positively was that man had subordinated his will to
   his sensuousness, and thereby lost the feeling, desire, and knowledge
   of the divine. The consequences of sin were held to be the following:
   First, by the majority, the universal mortality which had prevailed
   from Adam, or the loss of the true life; [527] secondly, the
   obscuration of the knowledge of God, and with it of religion in
   general. This darkening made it possible for the demons to seduce man
   from the true God, to gain him to their own service, and the idolatry
   of the creature, in the form of polytheism, and so even to exercise an
   almost complete dominion over him, and the earth associated with
   humanity. A third consequence of sin was found in a certain weakening
   of freedom, which, though still existing, yet only in rare cases
   succeeded, without new divine influences, in reaching a morally good,
   perfect life.

   Supplement.--The view taken by Iren√¶us and Tertullian of the
   fundamental importance of the first Fall for the whole future race, was
   imperilled by Origen's theory of a fall on the part of spirits in their
   pre√´xistent state. It once more gradually won acceptance as an
   authoritative Biblical doctrine, but it never obtained the same
   certainty, clearness, or importance among the Greek Fathers as among
   the Latin (i.e., after Ambrose); see Book II. of our description. The
   explanation which the theory of original sin furnished for the
   phenomenon of universal sinfulness was in form similar to Origen's, but
   was inferior to it in intelligibility, and was never unreservedly
   accepted by the Orientals. The later Greeks indeed, doubtless under the
   influence of the West, recognised original sin, but this only resulted
   in a contradiction; for the thought that each man was born in puris
   naturalibus, was, while no longer strictly formulated, never actually
   condemned. The old dilemma remained, that each man sinned either from a
   necessity of his nature or in virtue of his freedom; and the former
   opinion was at all times held in the East to be Manich√¶an. Inherited
   death, due to Adam, was taught as a rule; yet even in this matter
   certain views were never wholly obliterated which are only intelligible
   if death was regarded as something natural. From the point of view of
   the doctrine of redemption especially, it could seem more pertinent to
   hold death to be the natural destiny of man, from which, however,
   redemption delivered him. Accordingly, after Origen's theory had been
   abandoned on account of its want of Biblical support, all that was got
   in exchange for it was a contradiction: death was something natural and
   again unnatural. We cannot wonder at this contradiction; in the same
   way, no one really held the immortality assigned to the primitive state
   to be something indisputably natural, but neither was it regarded as
   absolutely supernatural.

   ¬ß 4. The Fall and Original Sin. Doctrine of Redemption.

   This is the place to define more precisely the influence which this
   Natural Theology gained on Dogmatics, i.e., on the conceptions of
   redemption through Jesus Christ. In so doing we must keep firmly in
   mind, that, in spite of this influence, the feeling remained uppermost
   that redemption was something superlatively exalted, something
   unmerited, a pure gift of God to humanity. This feeling was, however,
   more and more encouraged also by the fact that the simple tenets of
   Natural Theology fell into confusion and became less impressive through
   the enjoined and ever increasing attention to Biblical texts
   realistically interpreted, and the necessity of repelling the system of
   Origen. To this was added the constantly growing reluctance to reflect
   independently at all, as well as the grand impressions made by the
   divine dispensation which culminated in the incarnation of the Son of
   God, and was brought to view in the mysteries.

   In the first place, the conviction of the lofty and, at bottom,
   inalienable dignity of man roused the idea that man receives through
   redemption that which corresponds to his nature. If adoption to the
   sonship of God and participation in the divine nature appeared on the
   one hand as a gift above all reason and expectation, yet it was looked
   at on the other as corresponding to the nature of man already fixed in
   his creation. For man is God's image, and exalted as he is above the
   lower animals by his constitution, rises as a spiritual being into the
   heavenly sphere.

   Secondly, the last word that Natural Theology has to say of man is that
   he is a free and rational being, introduced into the opposition of good
   and evil. Such a being has really to do with God only in his capacity
   of creator and rewarder. All other points of contact must necessarily
   always resolve into that. Again, for such a being there can only exist
   one good, that is knowledge, which includes virtue, and besides this
   certain rewards alone find a place; for his nature requires that he
   should be independent in all his movements, nay, these only possess any
   value through such independence. The Deity stands at the beginning and
   the close of the history of free men as the power that creates and
   rewards. But the intervening space is not occupied by the Deity himself
   in order to govern man, and to preserve his allegiance. On the
   contrary, man has to deal solely with divine knowledge and rules in
   accordance with which his freedom is meant to evince itself; for this
   freedom, while in itself a liberty of choice, was given to him that he
   might achieve, in a zealous pursuit of virtue based on rational
   knowledge, the moral perfection possessed by the Deity Himself.

   This whole view, which is familiar to us from the Apologists, was never
   completely lost by the Greek Fathers. Its first consequence was that
   henceforth the whole of religion could be,--as already in the case of
   the Apologists--and was, looked at from the point of view of knowledge
   and law. It appeared as a morality based on pure knowledge of God and
   the world, one to which nothing could be added. Along with freedom, the
   natural moral law was implanted in man, that is, the sure consciousness
   of the rules, by which he had to prove what was in him. The rules
   corresponded ultimately to the laws of the universe set in operation
   and maintained by God as supreme First Cause. This natural law, when it
   had been obscured in the mind of man, was repeated in the Decalogue by
   an external legislation, and, on account of the hard-heartedness of the
   Jews, was supplemented with burdens, temporary commandments and it was
   finally reduced by Jesus Christ to the simplest of formulas, set in
   operation by the impressive preaching of rewards and punishments, and
   perfectly fulfilled by Jesus. He revealed the perfect knowledge of God,
   and restored the natural moral law--these two statements being really
   identical, for in both God appears as the supreme cause. [528] In this
   statement we have already mentioned the second consequence of the
   speculation: all grace can only possess the character of a support, of
   a rectification of knowledge. The whole of the operations of God's
   grace are in the end, crutches offered to feeble man. In offering them,
   God reveals a goodness which, after what he has already done in
   creation, is without any fixed limit. Grace is therefore not absolutely
   necessary for every man. [529] God, again, by no means reveals himself
   in it even as the blessing which man requires, but he simply imparts
   complete knowledge, and thus explains, and strengthens the motives for
   observing, the rules of conduct which man had long possessed. But in
   the third place, it follows from the speculation, that sin is nothing
   but the transgression, induced by imperfect knowledge, of those rules,
   whose observance does not exhibit man's dependence on God, but his
   independence and freedom. Sin subjects man to the judgment of God.
   Punishment is the gravest result of sin. But God would not be just, if
   he were not an indulgent judge. His goodness which supports man, has
   its counterpart in the indulgence which overlooks the time of ignorance
   of the individual, and leaves unpunished the sins of men whenever they
   feel penitent. [530] Since it is impossible in this whole question that
   there can be any suggestion of a restoration of man to that communion
   with God which he had forsaken, since on the contrary, the sole point
   was that man, to whom it was always possible to return, should not be
   impeded while striving and yet stumbling, the view was, in fact,
   inevitable that God remits punishment to every penitent. God would not
   appear just, but harsh and unloving, if he did not accept sincere
   penitence as an equivalent for transgressions. It was accordingly
   agreed that, although men are sinners, they become just in the sight of
   God through virtue and penitence, and redemption to eternal life
   through Christ can only benefit such as have acquired this
   righteousness through their independent efforts. The sacraments
   initiated men into this effort to obtain virtue, and they had also an
   indescribable influence upon it. But personal fulfilment of the law was
   still something thoroughly independent. Finally, it followed from this
   moral view, that it was impossible to gain a clear idea of the state of
   perfection. A state of freedom and a perfect virtue based on perfect
   knowledge cannot be raised higher than they are, and that which is
   given to reward the latter can never be intrinsically connected with
   it. The complete vacuity of the conceptions held of the final state,
   apart from the effect of the hope of an ever increasing knowledge,
   i.e., vision of God, was accordingly also the natural consequence of
   the conviction that man, because he is free, is dependent on no one,
   and that he is always at the goal when he fulfils the law of God.

   Thirdly, the rationalistic exposition of the doctrine of God and
   creation could not fail to impel apologists to expound the
   reasonableness of the doctrines of the Trinity, the resurrection of the
   body, etc. As a matter of fact the attempt was even made to prove the
   existence of a general agreement, a "common sense", as to the doctrine
   of the Trinity, and references were especially made to heathen
   philosophers, though, on the other hand, when it seemed expedient, the
   Greeks were denied any knowledge of the Trinity. Such references were
   all the more natural, since Neoplatonic philosophers, and at an earlier
   date Numenius, had constructed a kind of trinity. Cyril, again, in his
   Catechisms, supported the resurrection of the body to a very large
   extent on rational grounds, and others followed his example. For the
   extent to which even the doctrine of the Incarnation was included in
   Natural Theology, see following chapter.

   Fourthly, from all this it followed, that man could ultimately receive
   nothing from history which he could not, nay, had not to, wrest for
   himself. But the Logos in the flesh (logos ensarkos) belonged to
   history. Accordingly, it was impossible wholly to get rid of the view
   that there was a standpoint for which the historical Christ, since he
   was merely the edifying teacher, meant nothing. This view was, as we
   know, expressed perfectly plainly by Origen (see Vol. II., p. 342, n.
   1); and in this he by no means stood alone. It was not only repeated by
   half-heathen theologians, like Synesius, but it runs like a hidden
   thread through the conceptions of all Greek theologians, as long as
   they continued to think independently. It is the negative complement of
   the idea that the knowledge accompanied by virtue, which transcends all
   that is visible, and therefore all that is historical, includes
   blessedness in itself, and moreover, that it can be achieved from our
   own resources through a direct afflatus divinus. But still further:
   even in Augustine this view was not wholly surmounted. The man, who
   perceived the Deity, and had gained faith, love, and hope, stood beside
   the throne of God, and was with the Father of light and his essential
   Word; the historical Christ lay beneath him. [531] Further, even
   opponents of Origen, like Methodius and his successors, the mystics,
   had arrived at the same conception (see Vol. III., p. 110). For the
   ascetic mystic history passed away along with the world; he might cast
   aside all crutches, traversing independently the long, mysterious path
   from the extreme outside to the inmost recess of the spiritual. At the
   end of this path there stood, not Jesus Christ, but the unembodied
   Logos (logos asarkos), since he was pure truth and pure life. An
   incarnate Christ (ensarkos) was born in each who traversed this path.
   He in whom Christ was born, however, no longer needed the historical
   Christ. [532]

   Rationalism, or Christianity as the moral law which is freely
   fulfilled, and mysticism are regarded as opposites, and so they are
   before the tribunal of philosophy. But before that of positive religion
   they are not, they are rather akin, at least in the form in which they
   confront us in antiquity. [533] Mysticism of course embraces germs
   which when unfolded will resist rationalism. But at first it is nothing
   but rationalism applied to a sphere above reason (ratio). The admission
   that there was such a sphere formed the difference. It was mysticism as
   much as rationalistic moralism which secretly formed an opposition to
   the Christianity proclaimed by Jesus Christ to be the way and the truth
   for all men and for every grade. The most vital piety of the Greek
   Fathers, and the strenuous effort to make themselves at home in
   religion, insured them at least against losing the historical Christ.

   But it was only a danger that here threatened. We may not say more. The
   Deity had come down to earth, God had become man, and that in the
   historical Jesus--faith in this stupendous fact, "the newest of the
   new, nay, the only new thing under the sun," limited all rationalism.
   It imperatively demanded the investigation, on the one hand, of the
   ground and cause, on the other, of the fruit and blessing, of this
   divine dispensation. It was necessary to find the relation of the
   latter to the mystery and horror of death. It was indeed impossible to
   make the "naturalness" of death credible; for all nature, higher and
   lower, rebelled against it. And the consciousness of a capacity for
   perfect knowledge and goodness underlay in practical life the sense of
   incapacity. Hence the conviction that man must be redeemed, and through
   Jesus Christ is redeemed. The doctrines of innate freedom, the law, and
   the independent achievement of virtue were not abandoned; but they were
   counterbalanced by faith in the necessity and reality of redemption.
   And this combination, unsatisfactory as it seems to us, was yet capable
   of forming men of Christian character. Such men were never wanting in
   any century of the older Greek Church after Athanasius and Chrysostom,
   although their theology lacked the confession of the Psalmist: "It is
   good for me to cleave to God" (Mihi adh√¶rere deo bonum est). [534]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Instead of multiplying details we may here give the views on freedom,
   sin, and grace, of four eminent Greek Fathers, Athanasius, Gregory of
   Nyssa, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and John of Damascus.

   (1) Athanasius.--The conceptions formed by Athanasius of the original
   state of man, of sin and grace, show especially his inability to
   distinguish between nature and grace. In his work "De incarnatione"
   [535] he strove to prove that the incarnation was a necessity on the
   part of God. Therefore he emphasises strongly the destiny of man, and
   distinguishes it sharply from his empirical condition; for this destiny
   sets God a task which he must carry out under all circumstances, if his
   goodness (agathotes) is to remain in force. Therefore, in many of the
   arguments of this work, human nature appears as the creaturely and
   sensuous constitution, while everything else, including the endowment
   of reason, takes the form of a donum superadditum, potentially given in
   the original state, and binding on God himself, a gift of grace, which
   was meant to rise to complete knowledge of God through the free moral
   development of man.--for that was the goal. [Athanasius uses very
   different expressions for this in his writings: phantasia peri Theou
   (power of conceiving God), gnosis (knowledge) katanoesis (perception)
   katalepsis (comprehension) theoria ton theion (theory of divine things)
   theoria ton noeton (--of the intelligible) theoria peri tou Theou
   (science of God) ennoia tes eis patera gnoseos (concept of knowledge as
   to the Father)]. The change which took place in man through sin, or
   through death, is accordingly conceived as a loss of the divine. God is
   at the same time supremely interested in preventing man, once destined
   to obtain perfect divine knowledge, from becoming a prey to his lower
   nature, and being destroyed. [536]

   But even in the De incarn., and to a still greater extent in his later
   anti-Arian writings, Athanasius defends the idea that the rational
   spirit (psuche logike--Athanasius being a dichotomist) belongs to man's
   constitution, is immortal, and at bottom also inalienable. This psuche
   logike can gradually recognise the Logos and God from creation; it is,
   accordingly, not only an inalienable religious talent, but also an
   inalienable religious factor. Its power extends so far that there have
   been holy men in all ages (c. gent. 2; c. Arian. III: 33: polloi gar
   oun hagioi gegonasi katharoi pases hamartias). The reconciliation of
   the two contradictory statements,' that the higher endowment appears
   first as grace, then as nature, is to be found in the following points.
   (1) The psuche logike is only rational (logical) because it
   participates in the Logos, is his image, possesses a shadow of him (De
   incarn. 3), and retains its power only when steadfastly connected with
   him. For this reason it can be termed, although a natural provision, an
   "external" (c. Arian. II. 68: "Adam was outside before his
   transgression, having received grace and not having had it adapted to
   his body"; ho Adam pro tes parabaseos exothen hen, labon ten charin kai
   me stnermosmenen echon auten to somati.). (2) It is only in the
   apologetic arguments of the treatise De incarn. that Adam's fall and
   its consequence appear as forming a tremendous cleavage, and the state
   before and after the fall as a contrast. That was not the
   characteristic view of Athanasius, [537] as is shown by other arguments
   in the same writing, and the rest of the tractates. He contemplates not
   a loss once for all, but a gradual enfeeblement. Mankind has more and
   more lost, from generation to generation, the consciousness of God,
   i.e., through the darkening of his mind. That which above all burdened
   humanity, however, was not sin, but the sentence of death pronounced by
   God on the sinner--see next chapter. The faculties for knowing God, and
   thus for attaining the goal, remained, but there was no corresponding
   power actually to reach the goal. A Catholic investigator has expressed
   this as follows: [538] "Sinful man gradually lost, according to
   Athanasius, what was supernatural in his prerogatives, and retained
   only what was natural. Supernatural were moral goodness on the one
   hand, the correct consciousness and due use of rationality and
   immortality on the other; while rationality and immortality generally
   were natural." The intrusion here of the modern Catholic categories of
   "natural and "supernatural" is incorrect; for the spiritual nature of
   man was held by all the Fathers to be supernatural. But the idea is
   correct. But we must go further. The difference here is exclusively
   quantitative; it is only qualitative from the fact that what remains of
   higher powers is as a rule of less than its initial value, i.e., is no
   longer capable of reaching the goal. The same Catholic scholar is
   therefore perfectly correct, when--expressing himself with due
   caution--he finds (p. 159 f.) that Athanasius "does not seem to treat"
   the punishment of sin--better, sin--"with sufficient gravity". "He
   teaches, indeed, that the spiritual gifts of man were lost through sin,
   but he conceives this ruin as gradual in time and degree, depending on
   the extent to which men had turned from the contemplation of the
   spiritual and to the sensuous"; i.e., Athanasius simply follows an
   empirical and natural line of thought, in virtue of which he finds in
   mankind very different grades of moral and intellectual position. That
   this was a consequence of human freedom constituted a sufficient
   explanation in itself and freed the Deity of all blame. But it did not
   explain the universality of death, and left out of account Gen.
   I.--III. The above empirical view, which ultimately, indeed, cast a
   certain shadow on the Deity, and these chapters of the Bible compelled
   him to secure, somehow or other, a historical beginning for the present
   condition and therewith an original state of man. But the relations of
   the present to that beginning are really exhausted in the continuance
   of the once pronounced sentence of death; [539] and the primitive
   state, which is clearly enough described (c. gentes 2, De incarn. 3, 4)
   as a destiny--Adam himself having not yet attained what his endowments
   fitted him for, continued in this sense; nay, it ultimately embraced
   the idea that God was under the necessity of bringing the sentence of
   death to an end.

   However, Athanasius did arrive at positive conclusions as to the
   specific grace bestowed in the Christian redemption, in his polemic
   against the Arians. It is not to be wondered at that the discussion of
   grace in connection with creation and the natural endowments of man
   only resulted, on the premises stated by the Fathers, in tautologies.
   But against the Arians, where Athanasius was not interested in
   cosmology, he shows that we have received from grace what was by nature
   peculiar to the Son, and he definitely distinguishes between grace in
   creation and in redemption. Deut. XXXII. 6, 7, 18, where it is said
   that God created and begot men, he interprets as follows: "By creating,
   Moses describes the natural state of men, for they are works and beings
   made; by begetting, he lets us see the love of God to them after their
   creation" (c. Arian. II. 58). Similarly on John I. 12, 13: "John makes
   use of the words to become' because they are called sons, not by
   nature, but by adoption; but he has employed the word begotten',
   because they in any case have received the name of son . . . The
   goodness of God consists in this, that he afterwards becomes, by grace,
   the father of those whose creator he already is. He becomes their
   father, however, when--as the Apostle says--the men who have been
   created receive into their hearts the Spirit of his Son, which calls,
   Abba, Father.' But the latter consist of all who have received the Word
   and have obtained power from him to become children of God. For since
   by nature they are creatures, they can only become sons by receiving
   the spirit of the natural and true Son. In order that this may happen
   the Word became flesh, that men might be made capable of receiving the
   Deity. This conception can also be found in the Prophet Malachi, who
   says: Did not one God create you? Have you not all one Father?' For
   here again he says in the first place created', and in the second
   father', in order similarly to show that we are first, and by nature,
   creatures, but afterwards are adopted as sons, God the creator becoming
   also our father," etc. (c. Arian. II. 59). These expositions are
   certainly worth noting, but we must not overestimate them; for in the
   same discourses against the Arians they are modified to the effect that
   our sonship depends on the Logos dwelling in us, i.e., it receives a
   cosmological basis (see c. Arian. III. 10). In some passages it indeed
   looks as if the Logos only dwelt in us in consequence of the
   incarnation (see above and l. c. IV. 22); but it is quite clear in
   others that Athanasius thought of an indwelling before the incarnation,
   an indwelling wholly independent of it. With the recollection that
   there were sons of God in the O. T., Athanasius proves that the Logos
   was eternal. Accordingly, it is with him as with Clement of Alexandria:
   when the Fathers are not dealing with apologetic theology, and
   disregard the O. T., they are able to comprehend and describe the grace
   due to the historical Christ in its specific significance; but when
   they reason connectedly everything ultimately resolves into the natural
   endowment fixed once for all.

   (2) Gregory of Nyssa.--Gregory's theories also appear to be hampered by
   a contradiction because they are sketched from two different points of
   view. On the one hand he regards the nature of man in spirit and body
   as constituting his true being. To him, as opposed to Origen, the whole
   earthly world is good, a mirror of divine wisdom and power, a place
   meant to be pervaded by the divine. Before this could be possible "it
   was necessary that a union should be effected between its essential
   elements and the higher spiritual and divine nature, whereby first the
   divine shone as through a glass into the earthly world, after which the
   earthly, elevated with the divine, could be freed from liability to
   decay, and be transfigured. This central significance, this part of
   constituting a bond between two worlds in themselves opposed, was
   assigned to man, who stood at the head of the ascending scale of
   earthly creatures, which he comprehended like a microcosm, while he
   also as logikon zoon (a rational being) projected into the invisible
   world, in virtue of his nature made in the image of God, i.e.,
   spiritual and moral, and, especially, ethically free. This nature of
   man, besides, being created, possessed nothing of itself, but only like
   the sun-loving eye turned ever of its own accord to the eternal light,
   living on it, and interpreting it to the earthly world to which it
   essentially belonged." [540] But on the other hand, though Gregory
   rejected Origen's theories of the pre-existence of souls, the
   pre-temporal fall, and the world as a place of punishment (peri
   kataskeues anthropon, ch. 28, 29), regarding them as Hellenic dogmas
   and therefore mythological, yet he was dominated by the fundamental
   thought which led Origen to the above view. The spiritual and the
   earthly and sensuous resisted each other. If man was, as Scripture
   says, created in the image of God, [541] then he was a spiritual being,
   and his being so constituted his nature (see l.c. ch. 16-18). Man was a
   self-determining, but, because created, a changeable spirit, meant to
   share in all the blessings of God. So far as he had a sensuous side,
   and was mortal, he was not an image of God. Gregory now laid stress on
   man (homo)--as he conceived it, humanity--having been first created,
   and then having been fashioned into male and female. He concluded from
   this that the earthly and sensuous side of man was epigennematike, a
   subsequent creation, that, accordingly, the spiritual in man was
   conceptually the primary, and his sensuous and bodily nature the
   secondary, part of him. [542] He further concluded that man was
   originally designed to live a sexless life like the angels, that God
   would have multiplied men as he did the angels by his power "in a noble
   fashion" (peri katask., 17), and that the proper and natural
   dwelling-place of men was the pure and incorporeal future state.

   But near as he was to consequences drawn by Origen, [543] Gregory
   rejected them. The destiny of man sketched above was an ideal one. In
   other words, God, looking to the Fall, at once created and added the
   earthly and sensuous nature of man; nay, this was not merely due to the
   Fall, but, as is shown by the first line of thought given above, the
   earthly nature of man had also, since it was possessed by divine
   energies and transfigured, a lasting significance. But the Paradisaical
   state in which men lived before the Fall, was not the highest; for the
   body was not transfigured, though it had not yet been stained by sexual
   intercourse. The highest state, in so far as it was brought about by
   the resurrection (eis to archaion tes phuseos hemon apokatastasis), was
   that which notionally preceded the life in Paradise, but had never till
   now been concretely realised. It was life in its incorporeal abode
   after the fashion of the angels. [544] The incarnation of God had
   procured this state for all who, in virtue of their freedom, led a holy
   life, i.e., who lived as man did in Paradise before the Fall; for that
   was possible to man even when on earth. In all this we must remember
   that Gregory's hold on the traditional dependence on Gen. I.-III. was
   very loose: he does not speak of Adam, but always of us. All men had
   the same freedom as Adam. [545] All souls really passed through Adam's
   history. Above all, no transference of sin took place, although Gregory
   is a Traducian (see peri kat. anthr. ch. 29); every man sinned, because
   in virtue of his freedom he could sin, and by his sensuous nature
   (pathe) was induced to sin. By this means a state of depravity and
   death was introduced--sin also being death--from which man in fact
   could not deliver himself. Nothing but the union of God with humanity
   procured redemption. Redemption was, in harmony with the speculations
   as to Adam, strictly objective, and the question as to its
   appropriation was therefore, at bottom, no question. A new condition
   was revealed for all men without any co-operation on their part, but it
   became real only to those who led a holy life, i.e., who abstained
   entirely from sin.

   (3) Theodore.--Even in Iren√¶us [546] two inconsistent conceptions of
   the result of redemption stood side by side. It was held, on the one
   hand, to restore man to the original state from which he had fallen,
   and, on the other, to raise him from the primitive natural state of
   childhood to a higher stage. The majority of the Greek Fathers were not
   in a position to decide bluntly for either of these ideas; yet the
   former, under the influence of Origen, prevailed. It was only in the
   school of Antioch that it was really rejected, that the other view was
   emphatically avowed, and thus the most decided attitude adopted of
   opposition to Origen's theology. [547] The view of the Antiochenes was
   teleological--but there was an entire absence of any religious view of
   sin. In this respect it was directly opposed to Augustine's system.

   According to Theodore, [548] God's plan included from the beginning two
   epochs ("Katastaseis"), the present and future states of the world. The
   former was characterised by changeableness, temptation, and mortality,
   the latter by perfection, immutability, and immortality. The new age
   only began with the resurrection of the dead, its original
   starting-point being the incarnation of the Son of God. Further, there
   was a spiritual and a sensuous. Man was composed of both, the body
   having been created first, and the soul having then been breathed into
   it. This is the opposite of Gregory of Nyssa's view. Man was the
   connecting link between the two spheres; he was designed to reveal the
   image of God in this world. "Like a king, who, after building a great
   city and adorning it with works of every kind, causes, when the whole
   is completed, a fine statue of himself to be erected, in which all the
   inhabitants may gratefully revere the constructor, so the Creator of
   the world, after he had elaborated his work, finally produced man to be
   his own image, and all creatures find in him their centre, and thus
   contribute to the due glorification of God." Now although man is
   equipped with all the powers of reason and of will, yet, from the very
   nature of his Present condition, he is changeable, is defeated in the
   conflict, and is mortal. Not till the new principle of life was
   imparted by means of Christ could the changeable nature be raised to
   immutability. Till then, accordingly, man was exposed to temptation,
   and as a being made up of spirit and body was necessarily mortal. The
   threat of death in Paradise did not mean that death was the consequence
   of sin--it was rather natural; but it was designed to inspire man with
   as great a hatred of sin, as if the latter were punished by death.
   Death, natural in itself, was a divine means of education, and
   accordingly salutary. "God knew that mortality would be beneficial to
   Adam, for if they had been invested with immortality, men, when they
   sinned, would have been exposed to eternal destruction." But even the
   permission of sin was salutary, and formed part of the divine plan of
   education. God gave a command, and thereby elicited sin, in order that
   he might, like a loving Father, teach man his freedom of choice and
   weakness. "Man was to learn that while he was in a state of moral
   changeableness, he would not be capable of sustaining an immortal
   existence. Therefore death was announced to him as the penalty of
   disobedience, although mortality was from the beginning an attribute of
   human nature." [549] No sin without a command, but also no knowledge of
   good and evil, of the possession of spiritual faculties, finally, no
   conflict. Accordingly, God gave the command in order to raise Adam
   above the stage of childhood, and it necessarily provoked conflict and
   defeat.

   Adam is, however, to be thought of here, not as the ancestor, but as
   the type, of the human race. The law was given with the same object to
   all his descendants, to teach them to distinguish between good and
   evil, and to know their own powers and weakness. In the history of Adam
   we become acquainted with our own natural disposition. "In keeping with
   this we are under the necessity in our present life of rendering
   obedience to laws by which our natural power of making distinctions is
   awakened, we, meanwhile, being taught from what we ought to abstain and
   what to do, that the principles of reason may be active in us. Only
   when we find ourselves in the future state (Katastasis) will we be able
   with slight effort to perform what we recognise as good. Without law,
   therefore, we would have had no distinction between good and evil, and
   no knowledge of sin, and like irrational animals we would have done
   whatever occurred to us." In this state knowledge and fighting are
   required to obtain the victory, but we are constantly hampered by the
   body, the source of temptations. Christ first gave us redemption from
   death, an immortal nature, which, therefore, will obtain the victory
   without effort (on Rom. V. 18).

   Theodore was able to explain away the Pauline passages which support a
   transmission of the death worked by sin, just as he ignored the life of
   the first man in Paradise before the Fall. All men died because of
   their own sinful actions; but even this was meant figuratively. They
   died because of their natural constitution, in which sin was latent. He
   opposed Augustine's and Jerome's doctrine of original sin in an
   independent work, fragments of which have been preserved by Marius
   Mercator. "Adam was created mortal whether he sinned or not. For God
   did not say, Ye will be mortal,' but Ye will die.'" Theodore quoted Ps.
   CIII. 15, and Rome. II. 6. Against original sin he appealed to the case
   of saints like Noah, Abraham, and Moses. If God had passed sentence of
   death on all as the punishment of sin, he would not have made Enoch
   immortal. Accordingly, Baptism did not, according to Theodore, remove
   inherited sin, but initiated the believer into sinless discipleship of
   Christ, and at the same time blotted out the sins he had himself
   committed. In the former sense it had its use even for children; for
   Baptism, like all grace emanating from the incarnation, raised man to a
   new stage, elevated him above his present nature, and prepared him for
   the future state (Katastasis). This is most strongly emphasised by
   Theodore, and here his teaching is distinguished from the doctrines of
   Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum, [550] who subordinated redemption
   through Christ completely to the rationalistic theory. That Theodore
   did not do. While he was thoroughly convinced, with Pelagius, that in
   the present state everything turned on men's own actions which rested
   on knowledge, freedom, effort, and heroic fighting, yet he was equally
   certain on the other hand, that human nature did not attain
   immutability, immortality, and sinlessness through this conflict--it
   was merely a condition--but only through redemption. For this reason
   Christ came. He did not restore, but produced a new, a higher state. He
   did not heal, but transfigured. [551]

   Theodore's doctrine of man was strictly rationalistic and Aristotelian;
   it surpassed the theories of all the rest of the Greek Fathers in
   intelligibility and consistency. But for that very reason it did not
   correspond to all the ideas and desires embraced in the tradition of
   the Church.

   (4) John of Damascus.--The doctrines taught by this dogmatist became
   final in the Greek Church, the later Symbols being substantially at one
   with them, [552] because he combined the conceptions of the
   Cappadocians with the Antiochene tradition, in the modified form
   assumed by the latter in Chrysostom, and at the same time did justice
   to the constantly increasing tendency to refrain as much as possible
   from allegorising Gen. I. ff. Briefly, John taught as follows: [553] --

   Since God, "overflowing with goodness", was not satisfied with the
   contemplation of himself, but desired to have some one to whom he could
   do good, he created the universe, angels, and men. Even the angels were
   immortal, not by nature, but by grace; for everything which has a
   beginning has necessarily an end. But immortality being a gift became
   natural to spiritual beings, and therefore also to men. Men were
   created by God from nature, visible and invisible, in his own image, to
   be kings and rulers of the whole earth. Before their creation God had
   prepared Paradise for them to be as it were a royal castle, "set by his
   hands in Eden, a store-house of all joy and delight, situated to the
   East, and higher than the whole earth, but tempered and illumined by
   the finest and purest air, planted with ever blossoming flowers, filled
   with perfume, full of light, surpassing every idea of earthly grace and
   beauty, a truly divine place." [554] But it was only with his body that
   man was supposed to live in this material Paradise; he inhabited with
   his spirit at the same time the "spiritual" Paradise, which is
   indicated by the tree of life. [555] Of the tree of knowledge he was
   not at first to eat; for knowledge, while good for the perfect, is bad
   for the imperfect. The result of knowledge in the case of the imperfect
   was to make man, instead of devoting himself to the contemplation and
   praise of God, think of himself: Adam, immediately after eating,
   noticed that he was naked. "God intended that we should be free from
   desire and care, and occupied solely with luxuriating in the
   contemplation of himself." The eating "of all the trees" denoted the
   knowledge of God from the works of nature. In created man--the union of
   visible and invisible nature--the image of God consisted in power of
   thought and freedom of will, likeness to him in similarity in virtue,
   so far as that was possible. Soul and body (as against Origen) were
   created together. Man was originally innocent, upright, and adorned
   with all virtues; [556] his being so was a gift of grace; but so also
   was the fact that he was spiritual. He was spiritual that he might
   endure and praise his benefactor; corporeal, that he might be
   disciplined by suffering and the recollection of suffering; he was too
   proud of his greatness. Man was created a being who ruled in this
   present life, and was transferred to another. [557] He was finally to
   be made divine by submission to God: his deification consisting in
   participation in the divine glory, not in a transformation into the
   divine essence.

   Actually, i.e., according to the logical development of the system, the
   innocence of primitive man consisted in his power to be innocent, and,
   with the support of divine grace, to abide by and advance in goodness.
   A necessary converse of this was the power to revolt; "for it is no
   virtue which is done under compulsion". Man, "that little world",
   retained, however, along with his spiritual attributes, those of
   irrational nature; even in his soul there was an irrational part, which
   was partly capable of submitting to the rational, but was partly
   independent of it (the vital functions). The former embraced the
   desires, some of which were within limits permitted, while the others
   were not. But, the vital functions apart, over all was placed free
   will. It is in our power to choose, and man decides on his own actions.
   His origin alone is God's affair. "But error was produced by our
   wickedness for our punishment and benefit For God did not make death,
   nor did he delight in the ruin of the living; on the contrary, death
   was due to man, i.e., to Adam's transgression, and so also were the
   other penalties." [558] It was not right to attribute everything to
   divine providence; "for that which is in our power is not the affair of
   providence, but of our own free will." God, certainly, in virtue of his
   omniscience, knows everything from all eternity; he therefore assists
   by his grace those who, he knows, will avail themselves of it. They
   alone are also predestinated; their decision to be and do good is known
   to God. Those are damned to whom all the supports of grace are in vain.
   [559] With all this it remains true that all virtue comes from God; for
   by him it was implanted in nature, and by his support alone it is
   maintained. Accordingly, we have once more the principle that nature,
   rational and free, is a gift of grace; to be natural is to be virtuous,
   and conversion is the return from the unnatural. [560]

   Man was created male. Woman was formed merely because God foresaw the
   Fall, and in order that the race might be preserved in spite of death.
   [561] Man did not allow reason to triumph; he mistook the path of
   honour, and preferred his lusts. Consequently, instead of living for
   ever, he fell a prey to death and became subject to tribulation and a
   miserable life. For it was not good that he should enjoy immortality
   untempted and unproved, lest he should share the pride and condemnation
   of the devil. "Accordingly, man was first to attest himself, and, made
   perfect by observance of the commandment when tempted, was then to
   obtain immortality as the reward of virtue. For, placed between God and
   matter, he was to acquire steadfastness in goodness, after he had
   abandoned his natural relation to things, and become habitually united
   to God." But, seduced by the devil who enviously grudged man the
   possession which he had himself lost, man turned to matter, and so,
   severed from God, his First Cause, became subject to suffering, and
   mortal, and required sexual intercourse. (The fig-leaves denote the
   tribulations of life, and the skins the mortal body). Death, come into
   the world through sin, henceforth, like a hideous wild beast, made
   havoc of human life, although the liberty to choose good as well as
   evil was never destroyed. [562] But God did not leave himself without a
   witness, and at last sent his own Son, who was to strengthen nature,
   and to renew and show and teach by his action the way of virtue which
   led from destruction to eternal life. The union of Deity with humanity
   was "the newest of the new, the only new thing under the sun." [563] It
   applied, moreover, to the whole of human nature in order to bestow
   salvation on the whole. [564] This union resulted in the restitutio to
   the original state, which was perfect in so far as man, though not yet
   tested, was adorned with virtues. Christ participated in the worst part
   of our nature in order, by and in himself, to restore the form of the
   image and likeness, and to teach us further by virtuous conduct, which
   by his aid he made light for us. Then he overcame death, becoming the
   first-fruits of our resurrection, and renewing the worn-out and
   cast-off vessel. [565]

   It has been pointed out above (p. 240) that natural theology underwent
   no development in the Greek Church. We must premise, however, that the
   course of the history of philosophy is of greater moment for the
   development of the system, or for systematic monographs. Without
   anticipating we may here make the following remark. The Fathers of
   orthodox dogma in the fourth and fifth centuries were Platonists.
   Aristotelianism always led in this period to a heterodox form of
   dogma--Lucian, the Arians, the Antiochenes, etc. But a theological
   system constructed by the aid of Platonism could not fail at that time
   to become equally heterodox. After Platonism had done its work on
   dogma, and certain notions and conceptions were generally fixed, an
   orthodox system could only be created by means of Aristotelianism. Any
   further use of Platonism led to questionable propositions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [521] Augustine's exposition in Ep. CCV. 19, was ultimately the opinion
   of most of the Greek Fathers, so far as they were not completely
   devoted to Neoplatonism. "Vis etiam per me scire, utrum dei flatus ille
   in Adam idem ipse sit anima. Breviter respondeo, aut ipse est aut ipso
   anima facta est. Sed si ipse est, factus est . . . In hac enim
   quaestione maxime cavendum est, ne anima non a deo facta natura, sed
   ipsius dei substantia tamquam unigenitus filius, quod est verbum eius,
   aut aliqua eius particula esse credatur, tamquam illa natura atque
   substantia, qua deus est quidquid est, commutabilis esse possit: quod
   esse animam nemo non sentit, qui se animam habere sentit." But the
   thought which underlay the last saying of the dying Plotinus (Porphyr.,
   Vita Plot., ch. 2): peiromai to en hemin theion anagein pros to en to
   panti theion was not entirely surmounted by many Greek Fathers.

   [522] Therefore the great controversy lasting for centuries, whether
   the skins with which God clothed Adam and Eve were real skins, or
   bodies. He who agreed with Origen taught the latter; he who looked on
   man as a microcosm, the former. Yet here also there were composite
   forms: e.g., the skin meant only the fleshly body.

   [523] Scriptural proofs in support of the pre-existence of souls were
   not wanting: see John IX. 2. Jerome held to the doctrine for a time.
   Even Augustine was uncertain, and up to the time of Gregory the Great
   its flat rejection had not been determined on in the West (see Ep. VII.
   53).

   [524] See here even the Latins. Ambrosius learned the combination, as
   carried out by him in his De officiis, from the Cappadocians; see also
   the remarkable opening of his work De poenit. I. 1: "If the final and
   supreme aim of all virtue is to minister as far as possible to the
   spiritual benefit of our fellow-man, we may characterise benevolent
   moderation as one of the finest virtues." For the popular conceptions
   of Greek Christians, see Socr. H. E. III. 16, in connection with Rom.
   I. On the other hand, Augustine attempted to derive the philosophic
   virtues from man's dependence on God, from love; see, above all, the
   splendid exposition, Ep. CLV., ch. 12.

   [525] Even the subtle way in which Origen justified evil as an element
   in the best possible world (see Vol. II., p. 343 f.) was seldom
   repeated. Yet see Augustine, De ordine II. 11 sq. (one of his oldest
   writings): "mala in ordinem redacta faciunt decorem universi."

   [526] Sin was described as something negative not only by Augustine,
   but by all thinking Greeks before him. Their conception was undoubtedly
   based on a philosophical view that God was not only the originator of
   being, but really the sole being. On the other hand, a distinction was
   made between the eternal being and the creaturely, which came from God.

   [527] The Antiochenes thought differently (see under), and so did the
   author of the App. Const., who is exceedingly lax in his views; see,
   e.g., V. 7, p. 132 (Ed. Lagarde). The latter regards death as an
   original divine institution, which makes it possible for God to punish
   or reward. The resurrection was due to the rational soul from God.

   [528] We perceive the Greek conception most clearly from the law in
   Apost. Const. VI. 19-24. The section begins with the words: gnontes gar
   Theon dia Iesou Christou kai ten sumpasan autou oikonomian archethen
   gegenemenen, hoti dedoke nomon haploun eis boetheian tou phusikou
   katharon, soterion, hagion, en ho kai to idion onoma enkatetheto. The
   Decalogue is meant; it was given to the nation before its revolt, and
   God had no intention of adding sacrificial regulations, but tolerated
   sacrifices. After the revolt (of the golden calf) he himself, however,
   gave the ceremonial law: "He bound the people with irremovable fetters,
   and imposed heavy burdens and a hard yoke upon them, that they might
   abandon idolatry and turn again to that law which God had implanted by
   nature in all men" (ch. XX.). These "branding irons, lancets, and
   medicines" were, however, only for the sick. Christians who voluntarily
   believed in one God were delivered by him, above all, from the
   sacrificial service. Christ has fulfilled (kurosas) the law, but
   removed the additions, "if not all, yet the more irksome"; this is the
   opposite of Tertullian's opinion. He restored man's right of
   self-determination, and in doing so confirmed the natural law (ton
   phusikon nomon ebebaiosen). More rigorous conditions are only apparent.
   Just vengeance is even yet permitted, toleration is only better: ou ta
   phusika pathe ekkoptein enomothetesen alla ten touton ametrian (This is
   not the usual Greek view, but a conception peculiar to this lax
   author). But Christ himself abolished what had been "added" solely by
   fulfilling it first in his life and death, or by transforming the
   ceremonies into spiritual rites. The respect which Iren√¶us, as
   distinguished from the older teachers, had already entertained for the
   ceremonial law is shown even more clearly here.

   [529] Yet see what is said below on Macarius.

   [530] Forgiveness of sins was a conception which in this connection
   could hardly be carried out by the Fathers. The passing over of the
   time of ignorance and the acceptance of the reparation involved in
   penitence constituted forgiveness. Hardly another teacher from and
   after the fourth century, has expressed it so clearly as Clemens Alex.:
   ton progegenemenon Theos didosin aphesin, ton de epionton autos
   hekastos heauto (Quis div. salv. 40, cf. Strom. II. 14, 58, and
   elsewhere); but the statement as to Christ in P√¶dag. I. 3, 7: ta men
   hamartemata hos Theos aphieis, eis de to me examartanein paidagogon hos
   anthropos, formed a part of the fundamental view of the following age.
   We cannot wonder at this. Between mechanical expiations and penitence
   there is in fact no third term, as soon as the forgiveness of sins is
   applied to individual cases. Only where faith in forgiveness is the
   faith itself, is it more than a word, and yet not magical.

   [531] Augustine, De doctr. I. 34.

   [532] See even Augustine, on John, tract. 21, n. 8: "Gratulemur et
   gratias agamus non solum nos Christianos factos esse, sed Christum
   . . . admiramini gaudete: Christus facti sumus."

   [533] Bigg (The Christian Platonists of Alex., 1886, p. 51 f.) has also
   correctly perceived this; he is speaking of the attitude of Clement and
   of the Alexandrians generally: "On one side Rationalist, on another
   Mystic." "Though there is in them a strong vein of Common Sense or
   Rationalism, they were not less sensible of the mystic supernatural
   side of the religious life than Irenaeus. The difference is that with
   them the mystical grows out of the rational."

   [534] The text is indeed quoted by Macarius (Ep. I. fin) as the sum of
   all knowledge. But even to this theologian, who came nearest Western
   thought in some paraenetic remarks, and frequently drew the sharpest
   contrast between nature and grace (see Hom. I. 10, IV. 7-9), the
   "cleaving to God" meant nothing but the independent decision for God.
   The following passage (Hom. IV. 5) proves how remote Macarius was from
   Augustine: "How should God treat a man who, in the exercise of free
   will, devotes himself to the world, lets himself be seduced by its
   pleasures, or revels in dissipations? God only sends his help to him
   who renounces worldly pleasures, and preserves himself completely from
   the snares and traps of the sensuous world," etc. Here we see that the
   contrast between nature and grace was not so seriously meant. The same
   is the case with "law and gospel." No Greek Father was able to regard
   these as contrasted in the same way as we see them in the writings of
   Paul and Augustine.

   consist in the bodily. The latter is at most a copy of the "image," see
   peri katask. anthrop. 8, 12. But the "image" itself implies that it can
   only really be completely produced by free self-determination on the
   part of man. "If any compulsion obtained, the image would not be
   realised." (Catech. mag. 5).

   [542] We have, however, to make a distinction here. As a creaturely
   spirit man necessarily has a body, just as every picture has a material
   foundation, and every mirror a back. This body, therefore, belonged,
   according to Gregory, to the notion of man's nature; it was the
   phenomenon of the soul as the latter was the noumenon of the body. But
   Gregory distinguishes this body from the sensuous and sexually
   differentiated one.

   [543] Gregory borders very closely upon them, not only in peri katask.,
   but also in other writings. The fall does not, indeed, take the form of
   an event in the experience of individual men actually to be found in a
   pre-existent state, but of a kind of "intelligible collective deed of
   all humanity."

   [544] See peri katask. anthrop. 16-18.

   [545] Gregory here carries his speculation still further: God did not
   first create a single man, but the whole race in a previously fixed
   number; these collectively composed only one nature. They were really
   one man, divided into a multiplicity. Adam--that means all (peri
   katask. 16, 17, 22). In God's prescience the whole of humanity was
   comprised in the first preparation.

   [546] See Vol. II., p. 267 ff.

   [547] It is instructive that Marcellus also thinks of a glory presented
   through redemption, which is huper anthropon.

   [548] See Kihn, Theodor von Mops., p. 171 ff. Also the examples partly

   man's free will takes the first step, which is then seconded by God
   with his power, in the appropriation of the good; see his notes on Rom.

   [554] Accordingly we have here a recrudescence to some extent of what
   the older Greek Fathers called "Judaism" or "earthly conceptions," cf.
   Peter's Apocalypse.

   [555] Two traditional, inconsistent ideas are combined here; John was
   not quite clear as to the tree of life. He gives different explanations
   of it in De fide II. 11 and IV. 11.

   [556] This is strongly emphasised by John (II. 12, IV. 4); but he has
   carefully avoided stating how God could on his part adorn men with
   virtues. It cannot be proved that this is to be attributed to the
   influence of the West. Such an assumption is not necessary, for we also
   find in the older Greek Fathers rhetorical glorifications of the
   primitive state which do not harmonise with the system of doctrine.

   [557] These are the two states (katastaseis) of the Antiochenes.

   [558] The significance of Adam's fall for his posterity is recognised
   (II. 28), but it is noteworthy, only cursorily. John has no separate
   chapter on the Fall in his great work. Even II. 30, only discusses it
   under a more general heading.

   B.--THE DOCTRINE OF REDEMPTION IN THE PERSON OF THE GOD-MAN IN ITS
   HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT.

CHAPTER VI.

  THE DOCTRINE OF THE NECESSITY AND REALITY OF REDEMPTION THROUGH THE
  INCARNATION OF THE SON OF GOD.

   Natural theology was so wide in its scope as understood by the Greek
   Church, that, as indications in the preceding chapter will have already
   shown, only a historical fact absolutely unparallelled could make
   headway against it. The Greek Fathers knew of such a fact--"the newest
   of the new, yea, the only new thing under the sun"; it was the
   Incarnation of the Son of God. It alone balanced the whole system of
   natural theology, so far as it was balanced, and exerted a decisive
   influence upon it. But the incarnation could only be attached with
   complete perspicuity to that point in the natural system which seemed
   the more irrational, the more highly the value of human nature was
   rated--this point of contact being death. The dreadful paradox of death
   was destroyed by the most paradoxical fact conceivable the incarnation
   of the Deity.

   This at once implied that the fact could not but be capable of a
   subsequent explanation, nay, even of a kind of a priori deduction. But
   its glory, as an expression of the unfathomable goodness of God, was
   not thereby to be diminished. The necessity of redemption, whether that
   consisted in the restoration or the perfection of the human race, was
   based by the Fathers, as a rule, on the actual state of wretchedness of
   mankind under the dominion of death and sin. So far, however, as this
   condition was compared with the original state or destiny of man,
   redemption was already thought of as intrinsically necessary, and was
   no longer merely regarded as a postulate of man's need of salvation. In
   this connection the Fathers often lost sight of the capacity left to
   man of being and doing good. In innumerable passages they speak of the
   helplessness and irredeemableness of mankind, using expressions which
   could without difficulty be inserted in Augustine's doctrine of sin.
   But just as often a phrase occurs which betrays the fact that the whole
   view is nevertheless quite different; in other words, that the outward
   condition characterised by feebleness and death, and the sensuousness
   of corruptible human nature are thought of as the source of all evil
   and all sin. This state is accompanied by a darkening of knowledge
   which could not fail to subject man to the influence of the demons and
   lead him into idolatry.

   The divine act of grace in Christ applied to death, the demonic rule,
   sin, and error. In Homilies, Biblical commentaries, and devotional
   writings, these points of view interchange, or are apparently regarded
   as equivalent. [566] But since natural theology formed the background
   of their conceptions, the absolute necessity of the form assumed by the
   act of grace in the incarnation could be demonstrated neither in
   relation to sin nor to error. The whole question turned here on
   support, example, and illumination, or, if this line was crossed,
   theology ceased to be systematic and consistent. The importance of
   Athanasius and the Cappadocians consisted in the strenuous emphasis
   laid by them on the impressive connection existing between the
   incarnation and the restoration of the human race to the divine life,
   and in their consequent escape to some extent from the rationalistic
   scheme of doctrine; for the reference of the incarnation to sin did not
   carry the Greeks beyond it. The above combination had been made in the
   Church long before this (see Iren√¶us), but in the theology of Origen it
   had been subordinated to, and obscured by, complicated presuppositions.

   Athanasius wrote a treatise "Concerning the incarnation of the Logos"
   (peri enanthropeseos tou logou), an early writing whose value is so
   great because it dates before the outbreak of the Arian controversy.
   [567] In this work he went a step further: for he strove to prove that
   the redemption was a necessity on the part of God. He based this
   necessity on the goodness (agathotes) of God. This goodness, i.e.,
   God's consistency and honour, involved as they were in his goodness,
   were necessarily expressed in the maintenance and execution of decrees
   once formed by him. His decrees, however, consisted, on the one hand,
   in his appointment of rational creatures to share in the divine life,
   and, on the other, in the sentence of death on transgressions. Both of
   these had to be established. God's intention could not be allowed to
   suffer shipwreck through the wickedness of the devil and the sad choice
   of humanity. If it were, God would seem weak, and it would have been
   better if he had never created man at all. Then the transgression
   occurred. "What was God now to do? Ought he to have demanded penitence
   on the part of man? For one could have deemed that worthy of God and
   said, that as men had become mortal through the transgression, they
   should in like manner recover immortality through repentance (change of
   mind). But repentance (in itself) did not retain the true knowledge as
   regards God; God accordingly would in his turn have shown himself
   untruthful, if death had not compelled men; [568] nor did repentance
   deliver from the physical, but only put an end to sins. Therefore, if
   the transgression had alone existed, and not its consequence,
   mortality, repentance would have been all very well. But when, the
   transgression having occurred, men were fettered to the mortality that
   had become natural to them, and were robbed of the grace which
   corresponded to their creation in the divine image, what else should
   have happened? Or what was needed for this grace and renewal except
   (the coming of) him who also in the beginning made all things of
   nothing, the Logos of God? For it was his part once more to restore the
   corruptible to incorruption." [569]

   Athanasius shows that the Logos who originally created all things from
   nothing required to assume a body and thus to secure the restoration of
   man from corruptibility to incorruption (aphtharsia). How this happened
   Athanasius discusses in various, to some extent inconsistent, lines of
   thought, in which he speaks especially of a removal of men's guilt
   through the death of Christ, as well as of an exhaustion of the
   sentence of death in the sacrifice of his body presented by the Logos.
   From these premises it follows that Athanasius had the death of Christ
   in view, whenever he thought of the incarnation of the Logos. "The
   Logos could not suffer ten tou thanatou kratesin (the power of death'
   in mankind), and therefore took up the fight with death. He assumed a
   body and so became mortal. This body he surrendered to death on behalf
   of all. His body could not be really overcome, kept', by death. In it
   all died, and for this very reason the law of death (nomos tou
   Thanatou) is now abrogated; its power was exhausted on the body of the
   Lord (kuriakon soma); it had no further claim on his fellow-men (kata
   ton homoion anthropon) . . . The body assumed by the Logos came to
   share in the universal meaning of the Logos. The resurrection of the
   body and of the Logos guaranteed the general resurrection and
   incorruption (aphtharsia)." [570] Here follows the place assigned to
   the sacrifice. It presented that which was due (opheilomenon) to God in
   place of death. But the pervading and prominent thought of Athanasius
   is that the incarnation itself involved the Christian's passage from
   the fate of death to incorruption (aphtharsia), since the physical
   union of the human with the divine nature in the midst of mankind
   raised the latter to the region of divine rest and blessedness. [571]
   The result of the incarnation consisted accordingly, first, in the
   eradication of corruption (phthora)--by the existence of the divine in
   its midst, but, finally, by the death of Christ, in which the
   truthfulness of God was justified--and in the corresponding
   transformation into incorruptibility--renewal, or completion of the
   divine image by participation in the nature, free from all suffering,
   of the Deity. [572] But, secondly, the incarnation also resulted, as
   indeed had been long before held by the Apologists, in the restoration
   of the correct knowledge of God, which embraced the power of living
   rightly, through the incarnate Logos. But while Athanasius kept firmly
   in view this restoration of the knowledge of God through the Logos, he
   was not thinking merely of the new law, i.e., the preaching of Christ;
   he held it to have been given in the contemplation of the Person of
   Christ. In his work, that of a man, God came down to us. The dullest
   eye was now in a position to perceive the one true God--viz., in
   Christ--and to escape from the error of demon-worship. This thought is
   very significant; it had already been expressed by Clement and Origen,
   having received a deeper meaning from the latter, though he had not yet
   given it so central a place in his system. Athanasius expressly notes
   that creation was not sufficient to let us perceive the Creator and
   Father; we needed a man to live and work among us before we could see
   clearly and certainly the God and Father of all. [573]

   When Athanasius placed the knowledge of God side by side with the
   deliverance from death, the transition was obtained from the fact of
   redemption to the doctrine of the appropriation, and to the explanation
   of the particular result, of the work of love done by the Logos. This
   only benefited those who voluntarily appropriated the divine knowledge
   made accessible by the incarnate Logos, and who regulated their conduct
   by the standards and with the power thus given them. [574] In any case
   the transformation of the corruptible into the incorruptible (the
   Theopoiesis) remained under this conception the ultimate and proper
   result of the work of the Logos, being ranked higher than the other,
   the knowledge of God. [575] But here we find the greatest difference
   between Athanasius and like-minded theologians on the one hand, and
   Arius, the Eusebians, etc., on the other. The elements contained in
   their views are the same; but the order is different. For these
   "conservative" theologians saw the work of the Logos primarily in the
   communication of the true and complete knowledge which should be
   followed by a state of perfection. But Athanasius made everything tend
   to this consummation as the restoration and the communication of the
   divine nature. Accordingly, it was to him a vital theological question
   how the incorruptible was constituted which was represented in the
   Logos, and what kind of union it had formed with the corruptible. But
   while he put the question he was sure of the answer. His opponents,
   however, could not at all share in his interest in this point, since
   their interest in Christ as the supreme teacher did not lead them
   directly to define more precisely the kind of heavenly manifestation
   which he represented even for them. When they did give such
   definitions, they were influenced by theoretical, or exegetical
   considerations, or were engaged in refuting the propositions of their
   opponents by setting up others.

   The Trinitarian and Christological problems which had occupied the
   ancient Church for more than three centuries here rise before us. That
   their decision was so long delayed, and only slowly found a more
   general acceptance, was not merely due to outward circumstances, such
   as the absence of a clearly marked tradition, the letter of the Bible,
   or the politics of Bishops and Emperors. It was, on the contrary, owing
   chiefly to the fact that large circles in the Church felt the need of
   subordinating even the doctrine of redemption to rational theology, or
   of keeping it within the framework of moralism. The opposite
   conviction, that nature was transformed through the incarnate Logos,
   resulted here and there in a chaotic pantheism; [576] but that was the
   least danger. The gravest hindrance to the acceptance of the view of
   Athanasius consisted in the paradoxical tenets which arose regarding
   the Deity and Jesus Christ. Here his opponents found their strength;
   they were more strongly supported by the letter of Scripture and
   tradition, as well as by reason.

   Supplement I.--No subsequent Greek theologian answered the question,
   why God became man, so decidedly and clearly as Athanasius. But all
   Fathers of unimpeached orthodoxy followed in his footsteps, and at the
   same time showed that his doctrinal ideas could only be held on the
   basis of Platonism. This is at once clear in the case of Gregory of
   Nyssa, who in some points strengthened the expositions given by
   Athanasius. Yet his model was Methodius rather than Athanasius. [577]

   Gregory sought, in the first place, to give a more elaborate defence of
   the method of redemption--by means of the incarnation,--but in doing so
   he obscured Athanasius' simple combination of the incarnation and its
   effect. According to Gregory, God is boundless might, but his might was
   never divorced from goodness, wisdom, and righteousness. He next shows
   in detail (Catech. magn. 17-26) against Jews and heathens --as Anselm
   did afterwards--that the incarnation was the best form of redemption,
   because the above four fundamental attributes of God came clearly to
   light in it. Especially interesting in these arguments is the emphasis
   laid on God's treatment of those who had passed over to his enemies,
   his respect for their freedom in everything, and his redemption of men
   without wronging the devil, their master, who possessed a certain claim
   upon them. This account of the matter indeed had strictly an apologetic
   purpose. [578] In the second place, Gregory, while following
   Athanasius, still more strongly identified the state from which God has
   delivered us with death. The state of sin was death. He taught, with
   the Neoplatonists, that God alone was Being. Therefore all revolt from
   God to the sensuous, i.e., to not-being, was death. Natural death was
   not the only death; it might rather mean deliverance from the bonds of
   the body become brutal (l. c., ch. 8). Sensuousness was death. In the
   third place, although he also saw the redemption in the act of
   incarnation, Gregory held that it was not perfected until the
   resurrection of Jesus. That is, he was more thoroughly influenced than
   Athanasius by the conviction that the actual redemption presupposed
   renunciation of the body. We are first redeemed, when we share in the
   resurrection which the human nature assumed by Christ experienced
   through the resurrection (l. c., ch. 16). The mystery of the
   incarnation only becomes clear in this resurrection. The Deity assumed
   human nature, in order by this union to exhaust, until it had wholly
   disappeared, that which was liable to death in this nature, viz., evil.
   This result was only perfected in the resurrection of the human nature
   of Christ; for in it that nature was first shown completely purified
   and rendered capable of being possessed of eternal life. [579] In the
   fourth place, Gregory was able to demonstrate the application of the
   incarnation more definitely than Athanasius could with his figure of
   the king and the city. But he does so by the aid of a thoroughly
   Platonic idea which is only slightly suggested in Athanasius, and is
   not really covered by a Biblical reference (to the two Adams; see
   Iren√¶us). Christ did not assume the human nature of an individual
   person, but human nature. Accordingly, all that was human was
   intertwined with the Deity; the whole of human nature became divine by
   intermixture with the Divine. Gregory conceives this as a strictly
   physical process: the leaven of the Deity has pervaded the whole dough
   of humanity, through and in Christ; for Christ united with himself the
   whole of human nature with all its characteristics. [580] This
   conception, which was based on the Platonic universal notion
   "humanity", differed from that of Origen; but it also led to the
   doctrine of Apokatastasis (universalism), which Gregory adopted.
   Meanwhile, in order to counterbalance this whole "mystical", i.e.,
   physical, conception, he emphasised the personal and spontaneous
   fulfilment of the law as a condition, in the same way as the later
   Antiochenes. The perfect fulfilment of the law was, however, according
   to Gregory, only possible to ascetics. [581]

   In the fifth place, Gregory set the sacraments in the closest relation
   to the incarnation, recognising (l. c., ch. 33-40) Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper as the only means by which mortal man was renewed and
   became immortal. It undoubtedly appears superfluous to a rigorous
   thinker to require that something special should happen to the
   individual when all mankind has been deified in the humanity assumed by
   Christ. But the form given to his ideas by Gregory was in keeping with
   the thought of his time, when mysterious rites were held to portray and
   represent that which was inconceivable. Sixthly, and lastly, Gregory
   gave a turn to the thought of the incarnation in which justice was done
   to the boldest conception of Origen, and "the newest of the new" was
   subordinated to a cosmological and more general view. Origen had
   already, following the Gnostics, taught--in connection with Philipp.
   II. 10 and other texts--that the incarnation and sacrificial death of
   Christ had an importance that went beyond mankind. The work of Christ
   extended to wherever there were spiritual creatures; wherever there was
   alienation from God, there was restoration through Christ. He offered
   himself to the Father for angels and √¶ons (see Valentine). To all
   orders of spiritual beings he appeared in their own shape. He restored
   harmony to the whole universe. Nay, Christ's blood was not only shed on
   earth at Jerusalem "for sin" (pro peccato); but also "for a gift on the
   high altar which is in the heavens" (pro munere in superno altari quod
   est in coelis). [582] Gregory took up this thought. The reconciliation
   and restitution extend to all rational creation. [583] Christ came down
   to all spiritual creatures, tures, and adopted the forms in which they
   lived, in order to bring them into harmony with God: ou monon en
   anthropois anthropos ginetai, alla kata to akolouthon pantos kai en
   angelois ginomenos pros ten ekeinon phusin heauton sunkatagei. [584]
   This thought, far from enriching the work of the historical Christ,
   served only, as in the case of the Gnostics, to dissipate it. And, in
   fact, it was only as an apologist of Catholic Christianity that Gregory
   held closely to the historical personality of Christ. When he
   philosophised and took his own way, he said little or nothing of the
   Christ of history. [585] It is almost with him as with Origen. He also
   reveals a supreme view of the world, according to which that which
   alienates the Kosmos from God forms part of its plan as much as that
   which restores it to him, the Kosmos being, from its creation, full of
   God, and, because it is, existing in God. The incarnation is only a
   particular instance of the universal presence of the divine in
   creation. Gregory contributed to transmit to posterity the pantheistic
   conception, which be himself never thought out abstractly, or apart
   from history. A real affinity existed between him and the pantheistic
   Monophysites, the Areopagite, and Scotus Erigena, and even modern
   "liberal" theology of the Hegelian shade may appeal to him. In the
   "Great Catechism" (ch. XXV.), which was meant to defend the historical
   act of the incarnation, he has an argument which is in this respect
   extremely significant. [586] "The assumption of our nature by the deity
   should, however, excite no well-founded surprise on the part of those
   who view things (ta onta) with any breadth of mind, (not too
   mikropsuchos). For who is so weak in mind as not to believe when he
   looks at the universe that the divine is in everything, pervading and
   embracing it, and dwelling in it? For everything depends on the
   existent, and it is impossible that there should be anything not having
   its existence in that which is. Now, if all is in it and it in all, why
   do they take offence at the dispensation of the mystery taught by the
   incarnation of God, of him who, we are convinced, is not even now
   outside of mankind? For if the form of the divine presence is not now
   the same, yet we are as much agreed that God is among us to-day as that
   he was in the world then. Now he is united with us as the one who
   embraces nature in his being, but then he had united himself with our
   being, that our nature, snatched from death, and delivered from the
   tyranny of the Adversary, might become divine through intermixture with
   the divine. For his return from death was for the mortal race the
   beginning of return to eternal life." The pantheistic theory of
   redemption appeared in after times in two forms. In one of these the
   work of the historical Christ was regarded as a particular instance, or
   symbol, of the universal, purifying and sanctifying operations
   continuously carried out through sanctifying media--the sacraments--by
   the Logos in combination with, as in their turn on behalf of, the
   graded orders of supersensuous creatures; this was the view of
   Dionysius the Areopagite. The other form of the theory included in the
   very idea of the incarnation the union of the Logos with those
   individual believing souls in whom he was well pleased. The latter
   conception which was already prominent in Methodius is especially
   marked in Macarius. In Homily IV. e.g., (ch. 8, 9), his first words
   lead us to expect an exposition of the one historical incarnation.
   Instead of that we read: "Thus in his love the infinite, inscrutable
   God humbled himself and assumed the members of our bodily nature . . .
   and transformed in love and benevolence to men he incorporates and
   unites himself with the holy and faithful souls in whom he is well
   pleased, etc." In each a Christ is born. [587]

   The thought that Christ assumed the general concept of humanity occurs,
   though mingled with distinctive ideas, in Hilary, who was dependent on
   Gregory. [588] We find it also in Basil, [589] Ephr√¶m, [590]
   Apollinaris, [591] Cyril of Alexandria, etc. Throughout these writers
   the conception is clearly marked that in Christ our nature is
   sanctified and rendered divine, that what it has experienced benefits
   us, as a matter of course, in our individual capacity, and that we in a
   very real way have risen with Christ.

   Even in the Antiochenes passages occur which are thus to be
   interpreted--exegesis led them to this view; [592] but they exist, so
   far as I know, even in Chrysostom, [593] and they are so phrased in
   general as to show that according to them this suffering and dying with
   Christ, as an independent fact, was not merely a supplementary
   condition of the actual union with Christ, but the only form in which
   it was accomplished. In them the general concept of humanity does not
   occur; accordingly, the humanity of Christ is conceived much more
   concretely. He is really a fighting, striving man who reaches victory
   through free-will. [594] As this man himself is united morally with the
   deity, the moral element must never be left out of account in our union
   with him. But in so far as the incarnation of Christ produces a new
   state (Katastasis), one not included in the plan of humanity, it
   undoubtedly results in our glorification, a state not involved in the
   moral element per se.

   When we come to John of Damascus we no longer find any definitive
   conception of the incarnation. The clear intention assigned to it by
   Athanasius has escaped him; even of the ideas of Gregory of Nyssa only
   a part, and that the apologetic part, are reproduced (De fide Orth.
   III. 1, 6). At this point also the attempt to unite the Aristotelian
   tradition of the school of Antioch with the Alexandrian only led to a
   combination of fragments. Yet the sentence, "Christ did not come to
   this or that one, but to our common nature", [595] never wholly became
   a dead letter in the Greek Church. But everything taught in that Church
   as to the incarnation is already to be found either developed, or in
   germ, in Iren√¶us; not the simple exposition of Athanasius, but a
   mixture of the thought of the historical with that of the mystical
   redemption, is to be traced in the majority of the Fathers. It is the
   Christ in us, the cosmical Christ, as we already saw in Methodius.

   Supplement II.--Those Fathers, and they were in the majority, who found
   the cause of the incarnation in the intention of God to rehabilitate
   the human race, knew of no necessity for the incarnation apart from the
   entrance of sin. While they almost all explained that what Christ
   conferred was more and greater than what man had lost, yet they did not
   use this idea in their speculations, and they attached as a rule no
   special significance to it. But even Iren√¶us had also looked at the
   incarnation as the final and supreme means of the divine economy by
   which God gradually brought the original creation, at first necessarily
   imperfect, to completion. [596] Where this idea occurred, it also
   involved the other, that Christ would have come even if there had been
   no sin. Accordingly, those Fathers who laid no special stress on sin,
   seeing it appeared to them to be more or less natural, and who
   conceived redemption rather as a perfecting than restitution,
   maintained the necessity of the incarnation even apart from sin: so
   Theodore of Mopsuestia, Pelagius and others. [597] The incarnation was
   regarded by them as forming the basis of the life in which man is
   raised above his nature and common virtue, that is, the ascetic and
   angelic life. Clement of Alex., starting from quite different premises,
   expressed the same thought. Abstinence from evil was the perfection
   that had been attained even by Greeks and Jews; on the other hand, the
   perfect Gnostic, only possible after the complete revelation of the
   Logos, found perfection in the ascetic life of intuition, a life
   resting on faith, hope, and love. [598] Therefore in order to institute
   this life, the complete revelation of the Logos was required; it was
   unnecessary to bring sin into the question. However, the proposition
   that Christ would have come even if Adam had not sinned was, so far as
   I know, bluntly asserted by no Greek theologian; the combination of
   Adam and Christ in the Bible stood in the way.

   Supplement III.--On the ground of Biblical texts like Matt. XXV. 24,
   Eph. I. 3-5, 11, II. Tim. I. 8-10, the Greeks have also spoken (e.g.,
   Athan. c. Arian. II. 75-77) of an election of believers in Christ
   before the foundation of the world, and of the decree of redemption
   framed by God, with reference already to sin, before the creation.
   Athanasius even says that our future eternal life in Christ is
   conditioned by the fact that our life was founded on Christ even before
   time was. But the idea of predestination, like the thought that Christ
   is the head of his Church, is confined to the lines of a Biblical
   doctrine, which for that very reason is true. Neither the doctrine of
   the work of Christ, nor of the appropriation of his work, is influenced
   by those conceptions. As a rule, however, the idea of predestination
   takes the form that God having foreseen men's attainments in virtue
   elected them. This version is especially clear in the school of
   Antioch, and even enters into their Christology; but it is the opposite
   of what Paul meant.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [566] Perhaps the most comprehensive passage is Eusebius, Demonstr. ev.
   IV. 12. But it also shows how far Eusebius still was from the
   thorough-going view of Athanasius: Tes oikonomias ou mian aitian alla
   kai pleious heuroi an tis ethelesas zetein, proten men gar ho logos
   didaskei, hina kai nekron kai zonton kurieuse; deuteran de hopos tas

   [567] Draescke has attempted to show in a full discussion (Athanasiana
   i. d. Stud. u. Krit., 1893, pp. 251-315 that the writings "Against the
   Greeks" and the "Incarnation of the Logos" belong, not to Athanasius,
   but to Eusebius of Emesa, and were written A.D. 350. But after a close
   examination of his numerous arguments I find none of them convincing,
   and I am rather confirmed in my belief that no important objection can
   be raised against the authenticity of the two tractates. An accurate
   analysis of "De incarn." is given by Kattenbusch, l. c. I., p. 297 ff.

   [568] This sentence does not seem to me quite clear; the meaning is
   probably: since repentance does not convey the true knowledge of God,
   but death resulted from loss of the latter, God would have broken his
   word if he had abolished death in consequence of mere repentance.

   [569] De incarn. 7: Ti oun edei kai peri toutou genesthai e poiesai ton

   [570] Kattenbusch, p. 298.

   [571] L. c., ch. IX.: Hosper megalou basileos eiselthontos eis tina
   polin megalen, kai oikesantos eis mian ton en aute oikion, pantos he
   toiaute polis times polles kataxioutai, kai ouketi tis echthros auten

   anthropon para ton echthron epiboule pepautai, kai he tou thanatou
   hephanistai phthora he palai kat' auton ischuousa. Kattenbusch is right
   in considering Ritschl (l. c., I., p. 10, 11) to have gone too far in
   his assertion that "Athanasius' interpretation of the death and
   resurrection of Christ is a particular instance of the main thought
   that the Logos of God guarantees all redemptive work, using the human
   body in which he dwells as the means." Athanasius certainly did not
   regard the death and resurrection as merely particular instances. They
   formed the object of the incarnation; not that they were added or
   supplementary to it; they were bound up with it.

   [572] Yet the view of Athanasius was not simply naturalistic;
   incorruptibleness rather included the elements of goodness, love, and
   wisdom; a renewal affecting the inner nature of man was also involved.
   But it was not possible for Athanasius to expound this systematically;
   therefore Schultz seems to me to have asserted too much (Gottheit
   Christi, p. 80).

   [573] The chief passages occur l. c., XIV-XVI., chap. XIV. fin: One
   might suppose that the fitting way to know God was to recover our
   knowledge of him from the works of creation. It is not so, for men are
   no longer capable of directing their gaze upward; they look down.
   "Therefore, when he seeks to benefit men, he takes up his dwelling
   among us as man, and assumes a body like the human one, and instructs
   men within their own lower sphere, i.e., through the works of the body,
   that those who would not perceive him from his care for all and his
   rule might at least from the works of the body itself know the Logos of
   God in the body, and through him the Father." C. 15: Epeide hoi
   anthropoi apostraphentes ten pros ton Thaeon theorian. kai hos en butho
   buthisthentes kato tous ophthalmous echontes, en genesei kai tois
   aisthetois ton Theon anezetoun, anthropous thnetous kai daimonas
   heautois theous anatupoumenoi; toutou heneka ho philanthropos kai
   koinos panton soter, ho tou Theou logos, lambanei heauto soma kai hos

   Theon, aph' hon ho kurios ergazetai dia ton tou somatos ergon, ap'
   auton noesosi ten aletheian, kai di' autou ton patera logisontai. The
   sequel shows, indeed, that Athanasius thought above all of Jesus'
   miraculous works. He has summarised his whole conception of the result
   of redemption in the pregnant sentence (ch. XVI.): Amphotera gar
   ephilanthropeueto ho soter dia tes enanthropeseos, hoti kai ton
   thanaton ex hemon hephanize kai anekainizen hemas; kai hoti aphanes on
   kai aoratos dia ton ergon enephaine kai egnorizen heauton einai ton
   logon tou patros, ton tou pantos hegemona kai basilea. Origen had
   already laid stress on the perception of God in Christ, and set it
   above philosophical knowledge (analytic, synthetic, and analogical,
   against Alcinous, Maximus of Tyre, and Celsus): see c. Cels. VII. 42,
   44; De princip. I. 1. For Clement see Protrept. I. 8: ho logos ho tou
   Theou anthropos genomenos, hina de kai su para anthropou mathes, pe
   pote ara anthropos genetai Theos.

   [574] Parallel with this view and intertwined with it we undoubtedly
   have the other, that eternal life is mystically appropriated by means
   of sacred rites and the holy food. In this conception, which is
   extremely ancient, Christianity seems degraded to the level of the
   nature-religions of the East or the Gr√¶co-oriental mysteries (see
   Schultz, Gottheit Christi, p. 69). But as even the earliest
   Alexandrians (also Ignatius) constantly resolved the naturalistic view
   into a spiritual and moral one, so also hardly any one of the
   theologians of the following centuries can be named who would have
   purely and simply defended the former.

   [575] See esp. Orat. c. Arian. II. 67-70, where the final designs of
   Athanasius' Christianity are revealed. It is at the same time to be
   noted that while redemption meant restoration, it was the transference
   into a still higher grace. We experience all that was done to the body
   of Christ. We are baptised, as Christ was in Jordan, we next received
   the Holy Spirit, and so also our flesh has died, and been renewed,
   sanctified and raised to eternal life in his resurrection. Accordingly,
   Athanasius sums up at the close of his work, ch. 54: Autos gar
   enenthropesen, hina hemeis theopoiethomen; kai autos ephanerosen
   heauton dia somatos. hina hemeis tou aoratou patros ennoian labomen;
   kai autos hupemeine ten par' anthropon hubrin, hina hemeis athanasian
   kleronomesomen. eblapteto men gar autos ouden, apathes kai aphthartos
   kai autologos on kai Theos; tous de paschontas anthropous, di' ohus kai
   tauta hupemeinen, en te heautou apatheia eterei kai diesoze.

   [576] Not in Athanasius himself--Kattenbusch says rightly (p. 299): The
   theopoiesis is for A. an enhancement of human life physically and
   morally; his idea of it does not look forward to man being
   pantheistically merged in God, but to the renewal of man after his
   original type.

   [577] See Vol. III., p. 104 ff.

   [578] The Apologetic argument also includes the treatment of the
   question, why the redemption was not accomplished sooner. Apologists
   from Justin to Eusebius and Athanasius had put it and attempted to
   answer it. Gregory also got rid of it by referring to the physician who
   waits till illness has fully developed before he interferes (Catech.
   magn., ch. 29 ff.).

   [579] L. c., ch. 16. For, since our nature in its regular course
   changed also in him into the separation of body and soul, he reunited
   that which had been divided by his divine power as if by a kind of
   cement, and rejoined in an indissoluble union the severed parts (comp.
   Iren√¶us and Methodius). And that was the resurrection, viz., the return
   after dissolution and division of the allies to an indissoluble union,
   both being so bound together, that man's original state of grace was
   recalled, and we return to eternal life, after the evil mingled with
   our nature has been removed by our dissolution (!); just as it happens
   with liquids, which, the vessel being broken, escape and are lost,
   because there is nothing now to hold them. But as death began in one
   man and from him passed to the whole of nature and the human race, in
   the same way the beginning of the resurrection extended through one man
   to the whole of humanity."

   [580] See conclusion of the preceding note, and Herrmann, Gregorii
   Nyss. sententias de salute adipis., p. 16 ff. Underlying all the
   arguments of the: "Great Catechism" we have the thought that the
   incarnation was an actus medicinalis which is to be thought of as
   strictly natural, and that extends to all mankind. See Dorner
   (Entwick.-Gesch. d. L. v. d. Person Christi, I., p. 958 f.), who,
   besides, regards Gregory's whole conception as strictly ethical.

   [581] See Herrmann, l. c., p. 2 sq.

   hand, Didymus (De trinit. II. 7, ed. Mingarelli, p. 200): ho Theos
   logos ou dia tous hamartesantas angelous angelos; alla dia tous en
   hamartia anthropous anthropos atreptos, asunchutos, anamartetos,
   aphrastos. Yet in other places he has expressed himself like Origen.
   The latter was attacked by Jerome and Theophilus on account of this
   doctrine. The Synod of Constantinople condemned it.

   [585] Compare the whole dialogue with Macrina on the soul and the
   resurrection, where the historical Christ is quite overlooked.

   [586] To Athanasius also it was not unknown; see De incarn.41: ton
   kosmon soma mega phasin einai hoi ton Hellenon philosophoi kai
   aletheuousi legontes. Horomen gar auton kai ta toutou mere tais
   aisthesesi hupopiptonta. Ei toinun en to kosmo somati onti ho tou Theou
   logos esti, kai en holois kai tois kata meros auton pasin epibebeke. ti
   thaumaston e ti atopon ei kai en anthropo phamen auton epibebekenai
   k.t.l., c. 42.

   [587] A third form of the pantheistic conception of the incarnation can
   be perceived in the thesis, that the humanity of Christ was heavenly;
   in other words, that the Logos had always borne humanity in himself, so
   that his body was not of later origin than his divinity. This Gnostic
   view, which, however, is not necessarily pantheistic, had supporters,
   e.g., in Corinth in the time of Athanasius, who himself opposed it.
   (Ep. ad Epictetum Corinth.: see Epiphan.. p. 77, c. Dimoeritas). They
   said that the body born of Mary was homoousion te tou logou theoteti,
   sunaidion auto dia pantos gegenesthai, epeide ek tes ousias tes Sophias
   suneste. They taught, accordingly, that humanity itself sprang from the
   Logos; he had for the purpose of his manifestation formed for himself
   by metamorphosis a body capable of suffering. He had, therefore, on one
   side of his being given up his immutability, departed from his own
   nature (ellage tes idias phuseos) and transformed himself into a
   sensuous man. The point of interest here was the perfect unity of
   Christ. Those whom Hilary opposed (De trinit. X. 15 sq.) did not
   maintain the heavenly and eternal humanity of the Logos. On the other
   hand, this thesis occurs in Apollinaris, in whom, however, it is not to
   be explained pantheistically, although pantheistic inferences can
   hardly be averted. The heavenly humanity of Christ is also opposed by
   Basil in Ep. ad Sozopol. (65); it re-emerged in the circles of the most
   extreme Monophysites; but it was at the same time openly affirmed there
   by Stephen Bar Sudaili: "everything is of one nature with God"; "all
   nature is consubstantial with the divine essence" (Assem., Biblioth.
   II, 30, 291); see Dorner, l. c., II., p. 162 f., and Frothingham,
   Stephen Bar Sudaili (1886) who has printed, p. 28 sq., the letter of
   Xenaias which warns against the heresy "that assimilates the creation
   to God." Finally, a kind of subtilised form of this phenomenon is found
   in the old-catholic conception, that the Son of God came down to men
   immediately after the Fall, that he repeatedly dwelt among them, and
   thus accustomed himself to his future manifestation (see Iren√¶us'
   conception, Vol. II., p. 236). In the later Fathers, when they were not
   writing, apologetically, this old conception does not, so far as I
   know, occur often, or, it is very strictly distinguished from the
   incarnation; see, e.g., Athan., Orat. III. 30.

   [588] See, e.g., Hilary, Tract. in Ps. LI, ch. 16: "Ut et filius
   hominis esset filius dei, naturam in se univers√¶ carnis assumpsit, per
   quam effectus vera vitis genus in se univers√¶ propaginis tenet." Ps.
   LIV. ch. 9: "Universitatis nostr√¶ caro est factus." Other passages are

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI.

  THE IDEAS OF REDEMPTION FROM THE DEVIL, AND OF ATONEMENT THROUGH THE WORK OF
  THE GOD-MAN.

   ¬ß 1. Christ's Death as Ransom and Sacrifice.

   The Greek Fathers did not go beyond, nor could they give a more
   consistent form to, the views on this subject already expounded by
   Iren√¶us and Origen. [599] The fact of the incarnation was so closely
   and exclusively connected, at least in the East, with the conception of
   the result of redemption, that everything else had to yield in
   importance to the latter. Of course at all times and in all directions
   the attempt was made, after the example of Iren√¶us and the indications
   of Holy Scripture, to insert the facts of Jesus' history in the work of
   redemption. This can be seen especially in Athanasius and the two
   Cyrils--"Whatever happened to his humanity has happened to us." Again,
   the death of Christ was frequently recalled when the forgiveness of
   sins was taken into account; but it is difficult here to draw the line
   between exegesis, rhetoric, and dogmatics. As a rule, we obtain the
   impression that theology could have dispensed with all the facts of
   Christ's life. [600] On the other hand, the death of Christ always
   appeared so tragic and wonderful an event, that men were compelled to
   attribute a special saving value to it. But just as it was not
   represented in art up to the fifth century, so the majority of the
   Greeks really regarded it, along with Christ's whole passion, as a
   sacred mystery, and that not only in the intellectual sense. Here
   thought yielded to emotion, and imposed silence on itself. Goethe said
   towards the close of his life, "We draw a veil over the sufferings of
   Christ simply because we revere them so deeply; we hold it to be
   reprehensible presumption to play and trifle with and embellish those
   profound mysteries in which the divine depths of suffering lie hidden,
   never to rest until even the noblest seems mean and tasteless." That
   exactly represents the Greek feeling. It also gives the key to the
   saying of Gregory of Nazianzus (Orat. XXVII. 10) that the appreciation
   of the sufferings of Christ was one of those points on which it was
   possible to make a mistake with impunity (cf. Iren. I. 10). By this he
   meant, not only that the specific result of the passion was uncertain,
   but also that it was inexpressible. [601] It was reserved for the
   Middle Ages and our modern times to cast off all modesty and reverence
   here.

   Yet a few theologians and exegetes could not refrain from speculating
   about the death of Christ, though they did not yet use frivolous
   arithmetical sums. The death of Christ was, in the first place,
   connected, following Rom. VIII. 3, with the condemnation of
   sin--death--in the flesh (katakrinein ten hamartian (ton thanaton) en
   te sarki). That constituted the strongest connection of Ensarkosis
   (embodiment in the flesh), death, resurrection, and redemption, reached
   within the Greek Church. In Christ's final agony the Ensarkosis first
   came to some extent to its end, for by death the flesh was purified
   from sin and mortality, and was presented in Christ's resurrection
   pure, holy, and incorruptible. This thought was worked out in various
   ways by Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Cyril of Jerusalem, as well
   as, especially, by Apollinaris. [602] But in later times the conception
   of the complete hypostatic union forbade the vanquishing of corruption
   (phthra) and death being dated a moment later than the assumption of
   human nature. Therefore it was held that Christ had even at the
   incarnation destroyed corruption and death (the penalty of sin) from
   the flesh; but his death was wholly voluntary and economic.

   In the second place Iren√¶us had already, in a connected argument,
   emphasised the necessity of tracing the incarnation of the Logos and
   his passion to the goodness and righteousness of God, and he further
   insisted that Christ had delivered us not from a state of infirmity,
   but from the power of the devil, redeeming those estranged from God,
   and unnaturally imprisoned, not by force, but with due regard to
   justice. Origen, however, was the first to explain the passion and
   death of Christ with logical precision under the points of view of
   ransom and sacrifice. With regard to the former he was the first to set
   up the theory that the devil had acquired a legal claim on men, and
   therefore to regard the death of Christ (or his soul) as a ransom paid
   to the devil. This Marcionite doctrine of price and barter was already
   supplemented by Origen with the assumption of an act of deceit on the
   part of God. It was, in spite of an energetic protest, taken up by his
   disciples, and afterwards carried out still more offensively. It occurs
   in Gregory of Nyssa who (Catech. 15-27), in dealing with the notion of
   God, treats it broadly and repulsively. We find it in Ambrose, who
   speaks of the pia fraus, in Augustine and Leo I. It assumes its worst
   form in Gregory I.: the humanity of Christ was the bait; the fish, the
   devil, snapped at it, and was left hanging on the invisible hook,
   Christ's divinity. It proves that the Fathers had gradually lost any
   fixed conception of the holiness and righteousness of God; but on the
   other hand, it expresses the belief that the devil's power will not
   first be broken by the future appearing of Christ, but has been already
   shattered by his death. In this sense it is the epitaph of the old
   dogmatics which turned on eschatology. [603] For the rest, Gregory of
   Nazianus [604] and John of Damascus felt scruples about admitting God
   and the devil to have been partners in a legal transaction.

   With reference to the sacrifice of Christ, Origen was of epoch-making
   importance. On the one hand, he started from Rom. III. 25 and similar
   texts, on the other, he was strongly influenced by the Gr√¶co-oriental
   expiatory mysteries, and was the first to introduce into the Church,
   following the precedent set by the Gnostics, a theology of sacrifice or
   propitiation based on the death of Christ. He thereby enriched, but at
   the same time confused, Greek theology. He taught that all sins
   required a holy and pure sacrifice in order to be atoned for, in other
   words, to be forgiven by God; this sacrifice was the body of Christ,
   presented to the Father. This thought which, as expounded, approximates
   to the idea of a vicarious suffering of punishment, was adopted by
   Athanasius who combined it with the other ideas that God's veracity
   required the threat of death to be carried out, and that death
   accordingly was accepted by Christ on behalf of all, and by him was
   destroyed. [605] The idea that only the sacrificial death of God could
   vanquish death which was decreed by him, and thus conciliate God,
   occurs also in other Greek Fathers of the fourth century. [606]
   Following the estimate formed of the infinite value of the final
   passion of the God-man, [607] we constantly find in them also traces,
   sometimes more, sometimes less, distinct, of the thought of
   substitution in connection with satisfaction; but it remains obscure,
   [608] nay, it is frequently again withdrawn. In other words, it was
   sometimes twisted, as already in Iren√¶us, into the idea of example pure
   and simple. Thus the Antiochene school especially, who held his death
   to have been a natural event, considered that Christ's final passion
   influenced our freely-formed resolutions, but this version is not
   entirely wanting in any Greek Father. Others, e.g., Gregory of
   Nazianzus, explained that God did not demand the sacrifice--or
   ransom--but received it di' oikonomian. [609] In this case, as much as
   in earlier times, di' oikonomian meant "that the Scriptures might be
   fulfilled"; that is, it was tantamount to abandoning a direct
   explanation of the fact itself. In any case Cyril of Alexandria shows
   most clearly the vicarious idea of the passion and death of the God-man
   in connection with the whole Christological conception. [610] Eusebius'
   method of formulating the idea comes nearest Paul's, but it is only a
   paraphrase; [611] and the inability of theologians to recognise, expose
   and dispute the differences in their divergent conceptions is the
   strongest proof that they were not clearly aware of the bearing and
   weight of their own propositions.

   ¬ß 2. Christ as man the Mediator.

   The West, which had a scheme of its own in Christology, (see below)
   also possessed characteristic features in its conception of the work of
   Christ. [612] Here, as in almost all departments of activity in the
   Latin Church, it was of the highest moment that Tertullian, the jurist,
   and Cyprian, the ecclesiastical ruler, were the first Latin
   theologians. Disinclined for philosophical and strictly religious
   speculation, and dominated by a prosaic but powerful moralism, the
   Latins were possessed from the first of an impulse to carry religion
   into the legal sphere. The sacred authorities, or the Symbol, were
   regarded as the "law" (lex) of God; divine service was the place where
   the censure of God was pronounced; the deity was thought of as judge.
   Father, Son, and Spirit were held to be "person√¶" who possessed a
   common property ("substantia" not "natura"). Christ as the "persona"
   who controlled a two-fold "property," one inherited from his Father
   (his divinity) and one from his mother (his humanity). Christ required
   to be obedient to God, and--as Tertullian first said [613] and Cyprian
   repeated--had to satisfy God (deo satisfacere). [614] In this phrase
   everything was comprised: man--the Christian--was to give God that
   which he owed him, i.e., he was to satisfy God's legal claims. After
   this came the "promereri deum", i.e., rendering services to God,
   gaining God's favour by our merits. But in Tertullian and Cyprian
   "satisfacere deo" meant more precisely to atone for wrongs inflicted on
   God by acts of penitence, and to appease him (placare deum, satisfacere
   deo per hostias: Arnobius). Further "promereri" was applied above all
   to bona opera, works (fasting) and alms-giving (Cypr., De oper. et
   eleemos.). Even from the middle of the third century an ecclesiastical
   system was drawn out in the Latin West of works to be rendered to God
   (order of penance); [615] and this system gradually took in, like a
   net, all man's relations to God. It was throughout governed by the idea
   that the magnitude of transgressions and that of the works rendered to
   God, the penitential offerings, were to have a strictly legal relation,
   and, similarly, that what a man's merits entitled him to from God had a
   fixed and regulated value. It is not the case, as has been supposed,
   that this idea first arose in the Church in the Romano-German period,
   and is therefore to be described as a result of German criminal law. On
   the contrary, the idea of satisfactiones and merita already belonged in
   its entirety to the Roman age, and during it was strictly worked out.
   From the days of Tertullian and Cyprian the Latins were familiar with
   the notion that the Christian had to propitiate God, that cries of
   pain, sufferings, and deprivations were means, sacrificial means, of
   expiation, that God took strict account of the quantity of the
   atonement, and that, where there was no guilt to be blotted out, those
   very means were represented as merits. All those trivial definitions,
   which betray a low state of legal and moral views, and which one would
   gladly attribute to barbarous nations, had become the property of the
   Church before the incursion of the Germans; and Anselm's principle,
   "Every sin must be followed either by satisfaction or punishment",
   [616] can be already shown in Sulpicius Severus, [617] and corresponds
   to the thought of Cyprian and his successors. [618]

   But Cyprian also applied the "satisfacere deo" to Christ himself. As in
   the Middle Ages the most questionable consequences of the theory and
   practice of penance reacted on the conception of Christ's work, so from
   the time of Cyprian the latter was influenced by the view taken of
   human acts of penitence. His suffering and death constituted a
   sacrifice presented by Christ to God in order to propitiate him. This
   thought, started by Cyprian, was never afterwards lost sight of in the
   West. The angry God whom it was necessary to propitiate and of whom the
   Greeks knew so little, became more and more familiar in the West.
   Jewish and Pauline traditions here joined with those of Roman law.
   Hilary is especially clear in combining the sacrifice of Christ with
   the removal of guilt and of punishment. [619] This combination was
   repeated by Ambrose, [620] Augustine, and the great popes of antiquity;
   [621] least certainly, perhaps, by Augustine, who being a Neoplatonic
   philosopher and profound Christian thinker, was also familiar with
   other and more productive points of view. [622] The distinctive nature,
   however, of this Latin view of the work of Christ, as the propitiation
   of an angry God by a sacrificial death, was characteristically
   expressed in the firmly established thought that Christ performed it as
   man, therefore, by means, not of his divine, but of his human
   attributes. [623] The Latins were shut up to this conclusion. Their
   views regarding the work of Christ had been influenced by the works of
   penance enjoined by the Church, and on the other hand, the latter owed
   their value to the voluntary acceptance of suffering. Again,
   "sacrifices" in general were something human--God does not render, but
   receives sacrifices. Finally, mankind was in God's debt. From all this
   it necessarily followed that Christ in presenting himself as a
   sacrifice did so as man. But with this conclusion the Latins severed
   themselves from the supreme and final interests of Greek piety--for
   this rather required that the deity should have assumed with human
   nature all the "passiones" of the latter and made them its own. If the
   rigid Greek conception, which, indeed, in after times was full of gaps
   and inconsistencies, represented Christ's sufferings as a whole to be
   not voluntary, but the complete acceptance of the Ensarkosis (life in
   the flesh), yet God is always the subject. [624] On the whole,
   therefore, the conception of sacrifice is really alien in the view of
   the Greeks to the strict theory of Christ's significance. It found its
   way in through exegesis and the mysteries, and threatened the
   compactness of the dogmatic conception, according to which everything
   that Christ did was summed up in the complete assumptio carnis
   (assumption of the flesh). Nor was the alien view able to shake the
   fundamental conception that the God-Logos was the subject in all that
   pertained to Christ. Among the Latins, on the other hand, the idea of
   the atoning sacrifice plus substitution is genuine, and has no general
   theory against it; for they never were able to rise perfectly to the
   contemplation of Christ's work as the assumptio carnis, an expression
   of the loftiest piety among the Greeks. Those of the latter who, like
   the Antiochenes, either did not share or only imperfectly shared the
   realistic idea of redemption, referred, it is worth remarking, the work
   of Christ, like the Latins, to the human side of his personality. [625]

   Great as are the distinctions here--the West did not possess in
   antiquity a definite dogmatic theory as to the atoning work of Christ.
   Greek views exerted their influence; [626] and, besides, Western
   Christians were not yet disposed, with a very few exceptions, to
   trouble themselves with thoughts that had no bearing on practical life.

   [599] See Vol. II., pp. 286 ff., 365 ff.

   [600] The two Cappadocians doubted, not without reserve, the necessity
   of Christ's death. G. of Nazianzus says that the divine Logos could
   also have redeemed us thelemati monon, and G. of Nyssa (Orat. cat. 17)
   thought that the method of redemption was to be considered as arbitrary
   as the remedies of physicians. In other places, indeed, they expressed
   themselves differently, and Athanasius connected the death of Christ
   closely with the incarnation (see above).

   [601] See the great importance laid already by Justin on the Cross, an
   importance which it still has for the piety of the Greek Church.

   [602] Apollinaris who was the strictest dogmatist of the fourth
   century, substantially limited the significance of Christ's death, so
   far as I know, to this effect.

   [603] Iren√¶us held that men were God's debtors, but in the power
   (unjustly) of the devil. Origen held a different view. The devil had a
   claim on men, and Christ paid him his soul as the price, but the devil
   could not keep it. The devil acted unjustly to Christ, he was not
   entitled to take possession of one who was sinless; see passages given
   in M√ºnscher, p. 428 ff. Leo I, following Ambrose, gives the deception
   theory in a crude form.

   [604] See Ullman, Gregor, p. 318 f.

   [605] De incarnat. 9: Suoidon gar ho logos, hoti allos ouk an lutheie

   the vicarious endurance of punishment, and of a sacrifice, meet here;
   indeed, generally speaking, it was difficult to keep them apart.
   Athanasius throughout lays greater stress on the former; Origen, as a
   Hellenist, on the latter; see Athan., l. c., 6-10, but esp. Ch. XX:
   hopheileto pantas apothanein . . . huper panton ten thusian anepheren,

   [606] See esp. Cyril, Catech. XIII. 33, but also the Cappadocians; cf.
   Ullmann, l. c., p. 316 ff.

   [607] Even Cyril of Jerusalem says, l. c.: ou tosaute en ton hamartolon
   he anomia, hose tou huperapothneskontos he dikaiosune. ou tosouton
   hemartomen, hoson edikaiopragnsen ho ten psuchen huper hemon tetheikos.
   Similarly Chrysostom in the Ep. ad Rom., Hom. 10, T. X., p. 121. But
   the idea is emotional, and not the starting-point of a philosophical
   theory. It is different with the Westerns.

   [608] The expiation of our guilt is more infrequently thought of than
   the taking over of sin's punishment; that is guilt is only indirectly
   referred to.

   [609] See Ullmann, l. c., p. 319.

   [610] The idea of sacrifice falls into the background, which was only
   to be expected in the case of this energetic spokesman of genuine Greek
   Christian theology. Substitution passed naturally into, or rather grew
   out of, the idea of mystical mediation. Because all human nature was
   purified and transfigured really and physically in Christ, he could,
   regarded as an individual, be conceived as substitute or antilutron;
   see Cyril on John I. 29 and Gal. III. 13. Meanwhile Cyril also says
   that Christ outweighed all in merit. For the rest, he does not venture
   to affirm that Christ became a curse, but explains that he endured what
   one burdened with a curse must suffer. Compare also the exposition in
   the Orat. de recta fide ad reginas (Mansi IV., p. 809). The points of
   voluntariness and substitution were emphasised more strongly by
   orthodox theologians after Cyril, in order not to compromise the
   perfectly hypostatic deification--from the moment of the
   incarnation--of Christ's human nature.

   Comp. Wirth, Der verdienstbegriff bei Tertullian, 1892.

   [613] See Vol. II., p. 294.

   [614] This notion was afterwards one of the most common in the West.

   [615] It occurs already in Tertullian; but we do not yet perceive its
   full extent in the Church in his time; it has not even the full
   significance that it possesses in Cyprian.

   [616] Necesse est ut omne peccatum satisfactio aut poena sequatur.

   [617] See Sulp. Sev., Dial. II. 10: Fornicatio deputetur ad poenam,
   nisi satisfactione purgetur.

   [618] For fuller details see a later Vol.

   [619] On Ps. LIII. 12: "passio suscepta voluntarie est, officio ipsa
   satisfactura poenali"; Ch. 13: "maledictorum se obtulit morti, ut
   maledictionem legis solveret, hostiam se ipsum voluntarie offerendo."
   Along with this Hilary has the mystical realistic theory of the Greeks.

   [620] A few passages are given in F√∂rster, Ambrosius, pp. 136 ff., 297
   f. The "redimere a culpa" is for Ambrose the decisive point. In his
   work De incarn. dom. he is never tired of answering the question as to
   the motive of the incarnation with the phrase: "ut caro, qu√¶
   peccaverat, redimeretur," frequently adding "a culpa" He also uses very
   often the word "offerre" (applied to the death of Christ). In Ps.
   XLVIII., exp. 17, we read: "qu√¶ major misericordia quam quod pro
   nostris flagitiis se pr√¶buit immolandum, ut sanguine suo mundum
   levaret, cuius peccatum nullo alio modo potuisset aboleri." See
   Deutsch, Des Ambrosius Lehre von der S√ºnde und S√ºndentilgung, 1867.

   [621] There are many striking passages in Leo I. in which death is
   described as an expiatory sacrifice which blots out guilt. See,
   further, Gregory I., Moral. XVII. 46: "delenda erat culpa, sed nisi per
   sacrificium deleri non poterat. Qu√¶rendum erat sacrificium, sed quale
   sacrificium poterat pro absolvendis hominibus inveniri? Neque etenim
   iustum fuit, ut pro rationali homine brutorum animalium victim√¶
   c√¶derentur . . . Ergo requirendus erat homo . . . qui pro hominibus
   offerri debuisset, ut pro rationali creatura rationalis hostia
   mactaretur. Sed quid quod homo sine peccato inveniri non poterat, et
   oblata pro nobis hostia quando nos a peccato inundate potuisset, si
   ipsa hostia peccati contagio non careret? Ergo ut rationalis esset
   hostia, homo fuerat offerendus: ut vero a peccatis mundaret hominem,
   homo et sine peccato. Sed quis esset sine peccato homo, si ex peccati
   commixtione descenderet. Proinde venit propter nos in uterum virginis
   filius dei, ibi pro nobis factus est homo. Sumpta est ab illo natura,
   non culpa. Fecit pro nobis sacrificium, corpus suum exhibuit pro
   peccatoribus, victimam sine peccato, qu√¶ et humanitate mori et iustitia
   mundare potuisset."

   [622] Whatever occurs in Ambrose is to be found also in Augustine; for
   the latter has not, so far as I know, omitted to use a single thought
   of the former; he only adds something new.

   [623] See Ambrose, De fide III. 5: "Idem igitur sacerdos, idem et
   hostia, et sacerdotium tamen et sacrificium human√¶ condicionis officium
   est. Nam et agnus ad immolandum ductus est et sacerdos erat secundum
   ordinem Melchisedech." This thought recalls Cyprian, although Ambrose
   has hardly taken it from him; Cypr. Ep. LXIII. 14: "Christus Iesus
   dominus et deus noster ipse est summus sacerdos dei patris et
   sacrificium patri se ipsum obtulit." The same idea is repeated in
   contents and form, but rendered more profound, by Augustine (Confess.
   X. 68, 69, see Ritschl, l. c., I., p. 38): "In quantum enim homo, in
   tantum mediator; in quantum autem verbum, non medius, quia √¶qualis deo
   . . . pro nobis deo victor et victor et victima, et ideo victor quia
   victima; pro nobis deo sacerdos et sacrificium; et ideo sacerdos quia
   sacrificium;" see De civit. dei IX. 15: "Nec tamen ab hoc mediator est,
   quia verbum, maxime quippe immortale et maxime beatum verbum longe est
   a mortalibus miseris; sed mediator per quod homo." Accordingly, not
   only was that which Christ presented in sacrifice human-- Ambrose, De
   incarn. VI.: "ex nobis accepit quod proprium offeret pro nobis . . .
   sacrificium de nostro obtulit"; but Christ as priest and mediator was
   man. He had to represent man, and that again only a man could do. Very
   pregnant is the sentence of Ambrose (in Luc. exp. IV. 7) "ut quia solvi
   non queunt divina decreta, persona magis quam sententia mutaretur."
   That is the genuine idea of substitution. Ambrose does not even shrink
   from saying "quia peccata nostra suscepit, peccatum dictus est" (Expos.
   in Ps. CXIX., X. 14).

   [624] The subtle distinction between East and West is accordingly to be
   defined as follows. Both held that the human nature of Christ suffered,
   for the divine was incapable of suffering; but the East taught that the
   deity suffered through the human nature which he had made his own, the
   West that the man suffered and presented his human nature as a
   sacrifice in death; the latter, however, obtained an infinite value,
   for the deity was associated with it. From this we have two
   consequences. First, the idea of substitution could take root on Greek
   ground only superficially, and in an indefinite form; for the dying
   God-man really represented no one, but rather received all really into
   the plenitude of his divinity; it was different in the West. Secondly,
   the method of computing the value of Christ's mortal agony could
   similarly find no footing in the East; for the deity was the subject of
   the transaction, and precluded all questioning and computing. The
   striking utterances of Orientals as to the supreme value of Christ's
   work are really therefore only rhetorical (see above). If, on the other
   hand, the means of atonement under discussion, and the substitution are
   human, the question, of course, arises what value these possess, or
   what value is lent them by the divinity that is behind this sacrifice
   and this priest. We must take the statements of the Latin Fathers more
   literally. Ambrose confesses "Felix ruina qu√¶ reparatur in melius" and
   "Amplius nobis profuit culpa quam nocuit: in quo redemptio quidem
   nostra divinum munus invenit. Facta est mihi culpa mea merces
   redemptionis, per quam mihi Christus advenit . . . Fructuosior culpa
   quam innocentia; innocentia arrogantem me fecerat--and here indeed the
   paradox becomes nonsensical--culpa subjectum reddidit." (Numerous
   passages are given in Deutsch, l. c., see also F√∂rster, l. c., pp. 136,
   297). Augustine often repeats and varies this thought, and other
   Western writers reproduce it from him. "Felix culpa qu√¶ tantum et talem
   meruit habere redemptorem." Lastly, Leo L preaches (Serm. LXI. 3):
   "validius donum factum est libertatis, quam debitum servitutis."
   Sayings like these, apart from the special pleading in which Western
   writers have always delighted since Tertullian, are to be taken much
   more seriously than if they had come from the East. And in fact
   momentous speculations were certainly instituted by them.

   [625] An affinity exists between the theology of the Antiochenes and
   Latins--esp. pre-Augustinian; but it is greater to a superficial than
   to a more exact observer. The Antiochene conception always had the
   Alexandrian for a foil; it never emancipated itself sufficiently from
   the latter to set up a perfectly compact counter-theology; it was in a
   sense Greek piety and Greek theology watered down. The Latins did not
   possess this foil. Their theology must not be gauged by Origen and
   Neoplatonism as if they furnished its starting-point.

   [626] So from Hilary down to Augustine. The most important of the
   Western Fathers accepted the Greek idea of the purchase from the devil,
   although it flatly contradicted their own doctrine of the atonement;
   and this proves how uncertain they were. The grotesque conception of
   the role played by the devil at the death of Christ, had nevertheless
   something good about it. It reminded men that every knave is a stupid
   devil, and that the devil is always a stupid knave.
     __________________________________________________________________

APPENDIX ON MANICH√ÜISM.

   Three great religious systems confronted each other in Western Asia and
   Southern Europe from the close of the third century: Neoplatonism,
   Catholicism and Manich√¶ism. All three may be characterised as the final
   results of a history, lasting for more than a thousand years, of the
   religious development of the civilised peoples from Persia to Italy. In
   all three the old national and particular character of religions was
   laid aside; they were world-religions of the most universal tendency,
   and making demands which in their consequences transformed the whole of
   human life, public and private. For the national cultus they
   substituted a system which aspired to be theology, theory of the
   universe and science of history, and at the same time embraced a
   definite ethics, and a ritual of divine service. Formally, therefore,
   the three religions were alike, and they were also similar in that each
   had appropriated the elements of different older religions. Further,
   they showed their similarity in bringing to the front the ideas of
   revelation, redemption, ascetic virtue, and immortality. But
   Neoplatonism was natural religion spiritualised, the polytheism of
   Greece transfigured by Oriental influences and developed into
   pantheism. Catholicism was the monotheistic world-religion based on the
   O. T. and the Gospel, but constructed by the aid of Hellenic
   speculation and ethics. Manich√¶ism was the dualistic world-religion
   resting on Chald√¶ism, [627] but interspersed with Christian, Parsi, and
   perhaps Buddhist thoughts. To Manich√¶ism the Hellenic element was
   wanting, to Catholicism the Chaldee and Persian. These three
   world-religions developed in the course of two centuries (c. A.D.
   50-250), Catholicism coming first and Manich√¶ism last. Catholicism and
   Manich√¶ism were superior to Neoplatonism for the very reason that the
   latter possessed no founder; it, therefore, developed no elemental
   force, and never lost the character of being an artificial creation.
   Attempts which were made to invent a founder for it naturally failed.
   But, even apart from the contents of its religion, Catholicism was
   superior to Manich√¶ism, because its founder was venerated not merely as
   the bearer of revelation, but as the Redeemer in person and the Son of
   God. The fight waged by Catholicism with Neoplatonism had been already
   decided about the middle of the fourth century, although the latter
   continued to hold its ground in the Greek Empire for almost two
   centuries longer. As against Manich√¶ism the Catholic Church was certain
   of victory from the beginning; for at the moment when Manich√¶ism
   disputed its supremacy, it became the privileged State Church. But its
   opponent did not suffer itself to be annihilated; it lasted till far
   into the Middle Ages in East and West, though in various modifications
   and forms.

   Authorities--(a) Oriental.

   1. Mohammedan.--Among our sources for the history of Manich√¶ism the
   Oriental are the most important; of these the Mohammedan, though
   comparatively late, are distinguished by the excellence of the
   tradition and their impartiality, and must be given the first place,
   since in them old Manich√¶an writings are employed, and we possess no
   other originals of this sort belonging to the third century, except a
   few short and rather unimportant fragments. At the head stands
   Abulfaragius, Fihrist (c. 980), see the edition by Fl√ºgel and the work
   of the latter: "Mani, seine Lehre und seine Schriften," 1862; further,
   Shahrast√¢ni , Kit√¢b al-milal wan-nuhal (12th century), see edition by
   Cureton and German translation by Haarbr√ºcker, 1851; some notes and
   extracts in Tabari (10th century), al-Birun√Æ (11th century), Ibn
   al-Murtada (see Kessler, Mani, I., p. 346 ff.), and other Arabian and
   Persian historians.

   2. Christian.--Of Eastern Christians we learn most from Ephraem Syrus
   (+373) in various writings, and in a tractate on the subject edited by
   Overbeck; from Esn√Æk, the Armenian (see Zeitschr. f. d. hist. Theol.,
   1840, II.; Langlois, Collection, etc., II., p. 395 sq.), who wrote in
   the fifth century against Marcion and Mani; and from the Alexandrian
   Patriarch Eutychius (+916) who composed a chronicle (ed. by Pococke,
   1628). Besides this, separate pieces of information occur in Aphraates
   (4th century), Barhebraeus (Arab. and Syr. 13th century) and others.

   (b) Greek and Latin.

   The earliest mention of the Manich√¶ans in the Roman or Greek empire
   occurs in an edict of Diocletian (see H√§nel, Cod. Gregor. tit. XV.),
   which is held by some not to be genuine, and by others is dated A.D.
   287, 290, 296, or 308 (so Mason, The Persec. of Dioclet., p. 275 sq.).
   Eusebius gives a brief account (H. E. VII. 31). The main authority,
   however, for Greek and Roman writers was the Acta Archelai, which
   though not what they pretended to be, namely, an account of a
   disputation between Mani and Bishop Archelaus of Cascar in Mesopotamia,
   yet contain much that is reliable, esp as to the doctrine of Mani, and
   also embrace Manich√¶an fragments. The Acts, which for the rest consist
   of various documents, originated at the beginning of the fourth century
   (in Edessa?). Jerome maintains (De vir. inl.72) that they were
   originally composed in Syria (so also Kessler); but N√∂ldeke (Ztschr. d.
   deutsch. morgenl. Gesellsch. vol. 43, p. 537 ff.) and Rahlfs have
   disproved Kessler's arguments (G√∂tt. Gel. Anz., 1889, No. 23). They
   have made it very probable that the Acts, while they may have been
   based on Syrian sources, were originally written in Greek. They were
   soon afterwards translated into Latin. We only possess this version
   (Edited by Zacagni, 1698; Routh, Reliq. S. Vol. V., 1848); of the Greek
   version small fragments have been preserved (see on the Acta Archelai
   the discussions by Zittwitz in the Zeitschr. f. die histor. Theol.,
   1873, and the Dissertation by Oblasinski. Acta disp. Arch. et Manetis,
   1874. In the form in which we now have them, they are a compilation
   largely edited on the pattern of the Clementine Homilies). The Acta
   were made use of by Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech. VI.), Epiphanius (H√¶r.
   66) and very many others. All Greek and Latin students of heresy have
   put the Manich√¶ans in their catalogues; but they only rarely give any
   original information about them (see Theodoret Haer. fab. I. 26).

   Important matter occurs in the decrees of Councils from the fourth
   century (see Mansi, Acta Concil., and Hefele, Conciliengeschichte,
   Vols. I.--III.), and in the controversial writings of Titus of Bostra
   (4th century, in Syriac after a MS. of A.D. 411) pros Manichaious
   (edit. by de Lagarde, 1859), and Alexander of Lycopolis, Logos pros tas
   Manichaiou doxas (edit. by Combefis.). Of Byzantines, John of Damascus
   (De h√¶res and Dial.) and Photius (cod. 179 Biblioth.) deserve special
   mention; see also the Manich√¶an form of oath in Tollii insignia itiner.
   ital. p. 126 sq., and in Cotelier, P. P. App. Opp. I. p. 543; further,
   Rahlfs, 1.c. The controversy with the Paulicians and Bogomilians, who
   were frequently identified with the Manich√¶ans, renewed the interest in
   the latter. In the West the works of Augustine are the great repository
   for our knowledge of the Manich√¶ans:--"Contra epistolam Manich√¶i, quam
   vocant fundamenti", "Contra Faustum Manich√¶um", "Contra Fortunatum",
   "Contra Adimantum", "Contra Secundinum", "De actis cum Felice
   Manich√¶o", "De genesi c. Manich√¶os", "De natura boni", "De duabus
   animabus", "De utilitate credendi", "De moribus eccl. Cathol. et de
   moribus Manich√¶orum", "De vera religione", "De h√¶res." But the more
   complete the view of Manich√¶ism to be obtained from these writings, the
   more cautious we must be in our generalisations; for the Manich√¶ism of
   the West undoubtedly received Christian elements which were wanting in
   its original and oriental form.

   Mani's Life.

   Mani (Manes; Manes, Manichaios, Manich√¶us--the name has not yet been
   explained; it is not even known whether it is of Persian or Semitic
   origin) is said, as the Acta Archelai inform us, to have been
   originally called "Cubricus". Nothing reliable was ever known as to his
   life in the Romano-Greek empire; for the account in the Acta Archelai
   is wholly biassed and untrustworthy. Even if criticism succeeded in
   pointing out the sources from which it was derived, in discovering the
   tendencies that were at work, and in thus sifting out portions that
   were tenable, yet it could only do so by depending on the comparatively
   trustworthy Oriental Mohammedan tradition. We must therefore examine
   the latter alone. According to it, Mani was a Persian of distinguished
   birth belonging to Mardin. The date of his birth is uncertain; Kessler
   holds the statement in B√Ærun√Æ to be reliable, that he was born in anno
   527 of the era of the Babylonian astronomers, i.e., A.D. 215-216. He
   received a careful education from his father F√¢t√†k (Patekios) at
   Ctesiphon. Since the father afterwards adhered to the confession of the
   "Moghtasilah", the Baptists, in southern Babylonia, the son was also
   brought up in their religious doctrines and practices. The Baptists
   (see the Fihrist) were probably not unconnected with the Elkesaites and
   Hemerobaptists, and were in any case allied to the Mand√¶ans. It is not
   improbable that this Babylonian sect had adopted Christian elements.
   The boy accordingly became early acquainted with very different forms
   of religion. If even a small proportion of the narratives about his
   father rest on truth--the greater number being certainly only Manich√¶an
   legends--he had already introduced his son into the religious medley,
   out of which the Manich√¶an system arose. Manich√¶an tradition tells us
   that Mani received revelations, and took up a critical attitude towards
   religious instruction, even when a boy. But it is all the less
   trustworthy, as it also relates that he was forbidden to ventilate
   publicly his new religious knowledge. It was only when he was from 25
   to 30 years of age that he began to preach his new religion at the
   court of the Persian king, Sapores I.--on the day, it is stated, of the
   king's coronation, A.D. 241-242. A Persian tradition says that he was
   previously a Christian presbyter, but this, in any case, is wrong. Mani
   did not remain long in Persia, but undertook long journeys for the
   purpose of spreading his religion, and he also sent out disciples.
   According to the Acta Archelai, his missionary activity extended into
   the West, into the territory of the Christian Church; but it is certain
   from Oriental sources that his work was rather carried on in
   Transoxania, Western China, and southwards into India. His labours met
   with success there as well as in Persia. Like Mohammed after him, and
   the founder of the Elkesaites before him, he proclaimed himself the
   last and greatest of the prophets, whose revelation of God surpassed
   all that had been given till then, the latter being allowed only a
   relative value. He instituted the absolute religion. In the last years
   of the reign of Sapores I. (c. A.D. 270) Mani returned to the Persian
   capital, and gained adherents even at the court. Naturally, however,
   the ruling priestly caste of the Magi, on whom the king was compelled
   to lean, were hostile to him, and after a few successes Mani was taken
   prisoner and driven into exile. The successor of Sapores, Hormuz
   (272-273), seems to have been favourable to him, but Bahr√¢m I.
   abandoned him to the fanaticism of the Magi, and had him crucified at
   the capital, A.D. 276-277. His dead body was skinned; and his adherents
   were dreadfully persecuted by Bahr√¢m.

   Mani's Writings.

   Mani himself composed very many writings and epistles, of which a large
   proportion were still known to the Mohammedan historians, but which are
   now all lost. The later heads of the Manich√¶an Churches also wrote
   religious tractates, so that the ancient Manich√¶an literature must have
   been very extensive. According to the Fihrist, Mani made use of the
   Persian and Syriac languages; he invented, however, like the Oriental
   Marcionites before him, an alphabet of his own which the Fihrist has
   transmitted to us. In this alphabet the sacred works of the Manich√¶ans
   were afterwards written. The Fihrist enumerates seven principal works
   by Mani, six in Syriac and one in Persian; as to some of them we
   possess statements also in Titus of Bostra, Epiphanius, Augustine, and
   Photius, as well as in the oath-formula and the Acta Archelai. We have
   (1) The Book of mysteries: see Acta Archelai; it contained discussions
   with the Christian sects which were spreading in the East, especially
   the Marcionites and Bardesanians, as well as with their conception of
   the Old and New Testaments. (2) The Book of Giants (demons? probably in
   connection with Gen. VI.). (3) The Book of Regulations for the
   hearers,--apparently identical with the "epistula fundamenti" of
   Augustine and the "Book of the Chapters" of Epiphanius and the Acta
   Archelai. It was the most extensively circulated and popular of
   Manich√¶an works, and was also translated into Greek and Latin-being a
   brief summary of the whole fundamentally authoritative doctrine. (4)
   The Book Sch√¢hp√ªrak√¢n. Fl√ºgel was unable to explain this title;
   according to Kessler, it means "Epistle to King Sapores". This tractate
   contained eschatological teaching. (5) The Book of quickening. It is
   identified by Kessler with the "Thesaurus (vit√¶)" of the Acta Archelai,
   Epiphanius, Photius, and Augustine; in that case it was also in use
   among the Latin Manich√¶ans. (6) The Book pragmateia--contents unknown.
   (7)--In the Persian language; a book whose title is not stated in the
   Fihrist, as we have it, but which is probably identical with the "Holy
   Gospel" of the Manich√¶ans; see the Acta Archelai and many witnesses.
   This was the work set up by the Manich√¶ans in opposition to the Gospels
   of the Church. Besides these main works, Mani wrote a great number of
   shorter tractates and letters. The epistolography was then established
   by his successors. These Manich√¶an treatises were also familiar in the
   Gr√¶co-Roman empire and existed in collections--see the biblion
   epistolon in the oath-formula; and an "epistula ad virginem Menoch" in
   Augustine. Fabricius has collected the Greek fragments of Manich√¶an
   epistles in the Bibliotheca Gr√¶ca VII. 2, p. 311 sq. There also existed
   a Manich√¶an Book of "memoirs" and one of "prayers" in the Greek
   language, as well as many others (e.g., the "Canticum Amatorium" cited
   by Augustine), all of which, however, were destroyed by Christian
   Bishops in alliance with the magistracy. A Manich√¶an Epistle to one
   Marcellus has been preserved to us in the Acta Archelai. Zittwitz
   supposes that this letter was much fuller in its original form, and
   that the author of the Acts has borrowed from it the material for the
   speeches which he makes Mani deliver in the discussion. The same
   scholar refers the account of Turbo in the Acts and their historical
   statements (in section 4) to the writing of a Turbo of Mesopotamia, a
   Manich√¶an renegade and Christian. But on this point it is at least
   possible to hold a different opinion.

   Mani's Doctrine. The Manich√¶an System.

   Clearly as the main features of the Manich√¶an doctrine can be presented
   even at the present day, and certain as it is that Mani himself
   published a complete system, yet many details are uncertain, being
   differently described in different places, and it often remains
   doubtful what the original doctrinal view of the founder was.

   The Manich√¶an system of religion was a consistent and uncompromising
   dualism, in the form of a fanciful view of nature. No distinction was
   drawn between the physical and ethical: in this respect the character
   of the system was thoroughly materialistic; for Mani's identification
   of the good with light, and the bad with darkness, was not merely
   figurative. The light was really the only good, and darkness the only
   bad. Hence it followed, that religious knowledge could be nothing but
   the knowledge of nature and its elements, and that redemption consisted
   exclusively in a physical deliverance of the fractions of light from
   darkness. But under such circumstances, ethics became a doctrine of
   abstinence from all elements arising from the realm of darkness.

   The self-contradictory character of the present world formed for Mani
   the starting-point of his speculation. But the inconsistency appeared
   to him to be primarily elemental, and only secondarily ethical, in so
   far as he regarded the material side of man as an emanation from the
   bad parts of nature. From the self-contradictory character of the world
   he inferred two beings, originally wholly separate from each
   other,--light and darkness. Both were, however, to be thought of after
   the analogy of a kingdom. The light appeared as the good Primeval
   Spirit-God, shining in the ten (twelve) virtues of love, faith,
   fidelity, magnanimity, wisdom, gentleness, knowledge, intelligence,
   mystery, and insight. It also manifested itself in the heaven and earth
   of light with their guardians, the glorious √Üons. The darkness,
   similarly, was a spiritual realm: more correctly, it was represented in
   a spiritual, or feminine, personification; but it had no "God" at its
   head. It embraced an "earth of darkness". As the earth of light had
   five distinguishing features--the gentle breeze, cooling wind, bright
   light, cheering fire, and clear water--so also the earth of darkness
   had five--fog, fiery heat, burning wind, darkness, and damp. Satan with
   his demons was born from the realm of darkness. From eternity the two
   realms stood opposed. They came into contact on one side, but they did
   not mingle. Then Satan began to storm, and made an attack on the realm,
   the earth, of light. The God of light, with his Syzygos (mate) "the
   spirit of his right hand", now generated the Primeval man, and sent
   him, equipped with the five pure elements, to fight against Satan. But
   Satan proved himself the stronger. Primeval man was defeated for a
   moment. Now indeed the God of light himself marched forth, utterly
   defeated Satan by the help of new √Üons--the spirit of life, etc.--and
   delivered the Primeval man. But a part of the light of the latter had
   already been robbed by darkness, the five dark elements had already
   mingled with the generations of light. The Primeval man could only
   descend into the abyss and hinder the increase of the dark
   "generations" by cutting off their roots; but the elements once mixed
   he could never again separate. The mixed elements were the elements of
   the present visible world. This was fashioned out of them at the
   command of the God of light; the formation of the world was itself the
   first step in the redemption of the imprisoned portions of light. The
   world itself was represented as an ordered chain of different heavens
   and different earths, which was borne and supported by the √Üons, the
   angels of light. In sun and moon, which from their nature were almost
   wholly pure, it possessed great reservoirs, in which the rescued
   portions of light were stored. In the sun Primeval man himself dwelt
   along with the holy spirits, who pursued the work of redemption; in the
   moon the Mother of life was throned. The twelve signs of the zodiac
   constituted an artificial machine, a great wheel with buckets which
   poured the portions of light delivered from the world into the moon and
   sun, the illuminating vessels swimming in space. There they were
   purified anew, and finally reached God himself in the realm of pure
   light. The later Manich√¶ans of the West designated the portions of
   light scattered in the world--in elements and organisms--and waiting
   for redemption, "Jesus patibilis."

   Now it is characteristic of the materialistic and unhuman character of
   the system, that while the construction of the world is regarded as the
   work of the good spirits, the creation of man is referred to the
   princes of darkness. The first man, Adam, was begotten by Satan in
   conjunction with "sin," "greed" and "lust." But the spirit of darkness
   conjured into him all the portions of light which he had robbed, in
   order to make more certain of his power to rule over them. Adam was
   accordingly a divided being, created in the image of Satan, but bearing
   the stronger spark of light within him. Eve was associated with him by
   Satan. She was seductive sensuousness, although even she had a tiny
   spark of light in her. If the first human beings thus stood under the
   rule of Satan, yet from the very first the glorious spirits took an
   interest in them. These sent √Üons--e.g., Jesus--down to them, who
   instructed them as to their nature, and warned Adam especially against
   the senses. But the first man fell a victim to sexual lust. Cain and
   Abel, indeed, were not sons of Adam, but of Satan and Eve; but Seth was
   the lightpossessed offspring of Adam and Eve. Thus arose mankind, among
   whose individual members light was very variously distributed. It was
   always stronger, however, in men than women. Now the demons sought in
   the course of history to bind men to themselves through sensuality,
   error, and false religions, which included above all the religion of
   Moses and the prophets, while the spirits of light continued their
   process of distillation, in order to obtain the pure light in the
   world. But they could only deliver men by giving the true Gnosis as to
   nature and its powers, and by recalling them from the service of
   darkness and sensuousness. For this purpose prophets, preachers of the
   true knowledge, were sent into the world. Mani himself appears, in
   accordance with the example set by Gnostic Jewish Christians, to have
   held Adam, Noah, and Abraham, and perhaps Zoroaster and Buddha to have
   been such prophets. Probably Jesus was also considered by him to have
   been a prophet come down from the world of light; not, however, the
   historical Jesus, but a contemporary, seemingly human, Jesus who
   neither suffered nor died (Jesus impatibilis). Some Manich√¶ans taught
   that Primeval man himself, as Christ, spread the true Gnosis. But in
   any case Mani was held, as he claimed, to be the last and greatest
   prophet, having taken up the work of "Jesus impatibilis," and of Paul,
   who is also recognised, and having been the first to bring complete
   knowledge. He was the "guide," the "ambassador of the light," the
   "Paraclete." Only by his labours and those of his "imitators, the
   Elect," was the separation of light from darkness accomplished. The
   process by which the unfettered parts of light finally ascend to the
   God of light himself are very fancifully elaborated. He who has not
   succeeded in becoming elect in his life-time, has not completely
   redeemed himself, has to pass through severe purifications in the
   future state, until he also is gathered to the blessedness of the
   light. A doctrine of transmigration of souls has, however, been
   erroneously imputed to the Manich√¶ans. Bodies fall naturally, like the
   souls of unredeemed men, to the powers of darkness. But those souls,
   according at least to the oldest conception, contain no light at all; a
   later view, adapted to the Christian, taught that the parts of light
   existing in them were really lost. Finally, when the elements of light
   are delivered--completely, or as far as possible--the end of the world
   takes place. All glorious spirits assemble, the God of light himself
   appears, accompanied by the √Üons and the perfectly righteous. The
   angels who uphold the world withdraw from their burden, and everything
   collapses. An enormous conflagration destroys the world: once more the
   two powers are completely severed: high above is the realm of light
   restored to its perfect state, low down is the darkness (now
   powerless?).

   Ethics, Social Constitution and Cultus of the Manich√¶ans.

   The only possible ethics based on this doctrine of the world were
   dualistic and ascetic. But as it was not only considered necessary to
   escape from darkness, but also to cherish, strengthen, and purify the
   parts of light, the ethics were not merely negative. They aimed not at
   suicide, but at preservation. Yet in practice they assumed a thoroughly
   ascetic form. The Manich√¶an had to abstain above all from sensuous
   enjoyment. He was to deny himself to it by means of three seals: the
   signaculum oris, manus, and sinus (the seal of the mouth, hand, and
   breast). The signaculum oris forbade any use of unclean food, as well
   as impure talk; unclean were all animal flesh, wine etc.; vegetable
   food was permitted, because plants contained more light; but the
   destruction of plants, even the plucking of fruits or breaking of
   twigs, was not allowed. The sign. manus prevented any occupation with
   things, in so far as they contained elements of darkness. Finally, the
   sign. sinus forbade especially any satisfaction of sexual desire, and
   therefore prohibited marriage. Besides, life was regulated by an
   extremely rigorous list of fasts. Fast-days were selected in obedience
   to certain astronomical conjunctures. Moreover, men fasted, i.e., held
   holiday, regularly on Sunday, and generally also on Monday. The number
   of fast-days amounted almost to a quarter of the year. Times of prayer
   were appointed just as exactly. Four times a day had the Manich√¶an to
   utter prayers; and these were preceded by ablutions. He who prayed
   turned to the sun or moon, or to the North as the seat of light. Yet
   the inference that the Manich√¶ans worshipped the sun and moon
   themselves is wrong. The Fihrist has preserved some Manich√¶an forms of
   prayer. They were directed to the God of light, the whole realm of
   light, the glorious angels and Mani himself, who is addressed in them
   as "the great tree in whom is all healing." According to Kessler, these
   prayers are closely allied to the Mand√¶an and ancient Babylonian hymns.

   An asceticism so minute and strict as that demanded by Manich√¶ism,
   [628] could only be practised thoroughly by a few. The religion would,
   therefore, have been compelled to forego an extensive propaganda, had
   it not conceded a morality of two kinds. A distinction was accordingly
   drawn within the community between the "Electi" (perfecti), the perfect
   Manichaeans, and the Catechumeni (auditores), the secular Manich√¶ans.
   Only the former submitted to all the demands imposed by the religion;
   for the latter the regulations were relaxed. They required to avoid
   idolatry, witchcraft, greed, lying, fornication, etc.; above all, they
   must kill no living creature--keeping Mani's ten commandments. They
   were to renounce the world as far as possible; but they lived in fact
   very much like their fellow-citizens of other faiths. We have here,
   accordingly, substantially the same state of matters as in the Catholic
   Church, where a twofold morality also prevailed, viz., that of the
   religious orders and of the secular Christians. The only difference was
   that the position of the Electi was still more distinguished than that
   of the monks. For the Christian monks never wholly forgot that
   redemption was a gift of God through Christ, while the Manichean Electi
   were really themselves redeemers; therefore it was the duty of the
   Auditores to pay the deepest veneration and render the greatest
   services to the Electi. These perfect beings, as they languished away
   in their asceticism, were admired and cherished most devotedly.
   Analogous is the reverence paid by Catholics to the saints, and by
   Neoplatonists to the "philosophers," but the prestige of the Manich√¶an
   Electi surpassed that of both. Foods were brought to them in abundance;
   by using them the Electi delivered the parts of light from the plants.
   They prayed for the Auditores, they blessed and interceded for them,
   thereby abbreviating the purgatory through which the latter had to pass
   after death. And the Electi alone possessed complete knowledge of
   religious truths--it was otherwise in Catholicism.

   The distinction between Electi and Auditores did not, however,
   constitute the whole idea of the Manich√¶an Church; it possessed a
   hierarchy also. This fell into three grades, so that altogether there
   were five in the religious constitution. In its fivefold division the
   social order was conceived to be a copy of the numbers of the realm of
   light. At the head stood the Teachers ("the sons of gentleness" = Mani
   and his successors); these were followed by the Administrators ("sons
   of knowledge" = the Bishops); then the Elders ("sons of understanding"
   = the presbyters); the Electi ("sons of mystery"); and finally the
   Auditores ("sons of insight"). The number of Electi was at all times
   small. According to Augustine, there were twelve Teachers and
   seventy-two Bishops. One of the Teachers appears to have stood as
   president at the head of the whole Manich√¶an Church. At least Augustine
   speaks of such an one, and the Fihrist also knows of a supreme head
   over all Manich√¶ans. The constitution accordingly had here also a
   monarchical head.

   The cultus of the Manich√¶ans must have been very simple, and have
   consisted essentially of prayers, hymns, and ceremonies of adoration.
   This simple divine service promoted the secret spread of the doctrine.
   Besides, the Manich√¶ans seem, at least in the West, to have adhered to
   the Church's order of festivals. The Electi celebrated special
   festivals; but the chief one common to all was the "Bema" (Bema), the
   festival of the "doctoral chair," in memory of the death of Mani, in
   the month of March. Believers prostrated themselves before a decorated,
   but vacant chair, erected on a pedestal with five steps. Long fasts
   accompanied the festival. Christian and Mohammedan writers were able to
   learn little concerning the mysteries and "sacraments" of the
   Manich√¶ans; the Christians therefore raised the charge that obscene
   rites and repulsive practices were observed. But it may be held certain
   that the later Manich√¶an mysteries were solemnised after the style of
   Christian Baptism and the Lord's Supper. They may have been based on
   old rites and ceremonies instituted by Mani himself, and descended from
   natural religion.

   The Historical Position of Manich√¶ism.

   In the present state of the inquiry it is made out, and the account
   given above will also have shown, that Manich√¶ism did not rise on the
   soil of Christianity. We would even be better justified if we were to
   call Mohammedanism a Christian sect; for Mohammed approaches the Jewish
   and Christian religions incomparably more closely than Mani. Kessler
   has the credit of having shown that the ancient Babylonian religion,
   the original source of all the Gnosis of Western Asia, was the
   foundation of the Manich√¶an system. The opinion formerly held is
   accordingly wrong, viz., that Manich√¶ism was a reformation on the
   ground of Parsiism, a modification of Zoroastrianism under the
   influence of Christianity. It was rather a religious creation belonging
   to the circle of Semitic religions: it was the Semitic nature-religion
   lifted out of national limitations, modified by Christian and Persian
   elements, raised to the level of Gnosis, and transforming human life by
   strict rules. But when we have perceived this, we have only obtained a
   very general explanation of the origin of Manich√¶ism. The question
   rises, through what means and to what extent Mani adopted Persian and
   Christian elements, and further, in which form the nature-religion of
   ancient Babylonia was made use of by him.

   Now as regards the latter point, it is well known that the Semitic
   nature-religions had been taken up, centuries before Mani, by isolated
   enthusiastic or speculative heads, had been philosophically deepened
   and remodelled into "systems", in support of which missions were
   conducted by means of mysterious cults. Mani's enterprise was
   accordingly nothing new, but was rather the last in a long series of
   similar attempts. Even the earlier ones, from Simon Magus the Samaritan
   down, had adopted Christian elements to a greater or less extent, and
   the Christian Gnostic scholastic sects of Syria and Western Asia all
   pointed back to ancient Semitic nature-religions, which were
   transformed by them into a philosophy of the world and of life. But in
   particular the doctrines of the Babylonian sect of Moghtasilah, which
   were indeed influenced also by Christianity, seem to have afforded Mani
   material for his religio-philosophical speculation. The religion of
   this sect was not, however, purely Semitic (see the treatise by Kessler
   on the Mand√¶ans in the Real-Encyklopaedia f√ºr prot. Theol. u. Kirche, 2
   Ed., Vol. IX., p. 205 ff.; the Mand√¶ans were allied to the Moghtasilah,
   Brandt, 1. c.). From this source sprang the rigid dualism on which
   Mani's system was based; for the ancient Persian religion was not in
   principle dualistic, but in its ultimate foundation Monistic, since
   Ahriman was created by Ormuzd. However, ancient Persian theologoumena
   were employed by Mani. Even the designation of the antitheses as
   "light" and "darkness" was hardly independent of Parsiism, and
   elsewhere in Manich√¶ism there occur technical terms taken from the
   Persian religion. Whether Mani's idea of redemption goes back to the
   ancient Babylonian religion or to Zoroastrianism, I do not venture to
   decide; the idea of the "Prophet" and the "Primeval man" is at all
   events Semitic.

   It is very difficult to determine how far Mani's acquaintance with
   Christianity went, and how much he borrowed from it; further, through
   what agencies Christian knowledge reached him. In any case, in those
   regions where Manich√¶ism was settled and where it came more closely
   into contact with Christianity, it was at a later stage influenced by
   the latter. Western Manich√¶ans of the fourth and fifth centuries were
   much more "Christian" than those of the East. In this respect the
   system passed through the same development as Neoplatonism. As regards
   Mani himself, it is safest to suppose that he held Judaism as well as
   Christianity to be entirely false religions. But if he not only
   characterised himself as the Paraclete--and it is probable that he
   originated this use of the title--but also admitted "Jesus" to so high
   a role in his system, we can hardly explain this otherwise than by
   supposing that he distinguished between Christianity and Christianity.
   The religion which emanated from the historical Christ was to him as
   objectionable as that Christ himself and as Judaism; i.e., Catholicism
   was to him a diabolical religion. But he distinguished the Jesus of
   darkness from the Jesus of light, who wrought contemporaneously with
   the other, This distinction agrees as strikingly with that of the
   Gnostic Basilides, as the criticism of the O. T. conducted by
   Manich√¶ism with that of the Marcionites; (see even the Acta Archelai in
   which Marcion's antitheses are placed in Mani's lips). Finally,
   Manich√¶an doctrines show agreement with those of the Christian
   Elkesaites; yet it is possible, nay, probable, that the latter are to
   be derived from the common ancient Semitic source, and therefore they
   do not come further into consideration. Mani's historical relation to
   Christianity will therefore be as follows: from Catholicism, with which
   in all probability he was not very accurately acquainted, Mani borrowed
   nothing, rejecting it rather as a devilish error. On the other hand, he
   regarded Christianity in the form which it had assumed in the
   Basilidian and Marcionite sects (also among the Bardesanians ?) as a
   relatively valuable and correct religion. But from them, as also from
   the Persians, he took hardly anything but names, and perhaps, besides,
   what criticism he had of the O. T. and Judaism. His lofty estimate of
   Paul (and his epistles?), as well as his express rejection of the Acts
   of the Apostles, also point to influences due to Marcionitism. He seems
   to have recognised and to have interpreted in accordance with his own
   teaching a part of the historical matter of the Gospel.

   Finally, the question further rises whether Buddhistic elements are not
   to be observed in Manichaeism. The majority of later scholars since F.
   Chr. Baur have answered this question in the affirmative. According to
   Kessler, Mani used Buddha's teaching, at least for his ethics. There is
   no doubt that he took long journeys to India, and was familiar with
   Buddhism. The occurrence of the name of Buddha (Budda) in the legend
   about Mani and perhaps in his own writings points to the fact that the
   founder of this religion concerned himself with Buddhism. But what he
   borrowed from it for his own doctrine must have been very unimportant
   On a closer comparison we find that the difference between the two
   faiths is in all their main doctrines very great, and that the
   resemblances are almost always merely accidental. This is true even as
   regards morality and asceticism. There is no point in Manich√¶ism for
   whose explanation we need have recourse to Buddhism. Under such
   circumstances any relationship between the two religions remains a bare
   possibility; nor has the investigation of Geyler raised this
   possibility to a probability (Das System des Manich√§ismus und sein
   Verh√§ltniss zum Buddhismus, Jena 1875).

   How are we to explain the fact that Manichaeism spread so rapidly and
   really became a world-religion? The answer has been given that it was
   because it was the complete Gnosis, the fullest, most consistent, and
   most artistic system based on the ancient Babylonian religion (so
   Kessler). This explanation is not sufficient, for no religion makes an
   impression mainly by its doctrinal system, however complete that may
   be. But it is also incorrect, for the older Gnostic systems were not
   more meagre than the Manichaean. What rather gave Manich√¶ism its
   strength was, above all, the combination of ancient mythology and a
   rigid materialistic dualism with an extremely simple, spiritual cultus,
   and a strict morality; this was supplemented by the personality of the
   founder (of which indeed we know little enough). If we compare it with
   the Semitic nature-religions, it is obvious that it retained their
   mythologies, transformed into "doctrines," but did away with the whole
   sensuous cultus, substituting a spiritual worship as well as a strict
   morality. Thus it was capable of satisfying the new wants of an old
   world. It offered revelation, redemption, moral virtue, and
   immortality, spiritual blessings, on the ground of nature-religion.
   Further, the simple and yet firm constitution calls for attention which
   Mani himself gave to his institution. The learned and the ignorant, the
   enthusiast and the man of the world, could here find a welcome, no one
   had more laid upon him than he could and would bear; moreover, each was
   attracted and secured by the prospect of reaching a higher stage, while
   those who were gifted were besides promised that they would require to
   submit to no authority, but would be led by pure reason to God. As this
   religion was thus adapted, perhaps beforehand, to individual needs, it
   was also capable of continuously appropriating what was foreign.
   Furnished from the first with fragments of different religions, it
   could increase or diminish its store, without breaking its own elastic
   structure. But a great capacity for adaptation was quite as necessary
   to a world-religion, as a divine founder in whom men could see and
   venerate the supreme revelation of God himself. While Manich√¶ism in
   fact knew of no redeemer, although it gave Mani this title; while it
   only recognised a physical and Gnostic process of redemption; yet in
   Mani it possessed the chief prophet of God.

   If we notice, finally, that Manich√¶ism presented a simple, apparently
   profound, and yet easy, solution of the problem of good and evil, which
   had become especially burdensome in the second and third centuries, we
   have named the most important phenomena which explain its rapid
   extension.

   Sketch of the History of Manichceism.

   Manichaeism first got a firm footing in the East, in Persia,
   Mesopotamia, and Transoxania. The persecutions which it had to endure
   did not hinder its extension. The seat of the Manich√¶an Pope was for
   centuries in Babylon, and afterwards in Samarcand. Even after Islam had
   conquered the East, Manich√¶ism held its ground; it even seems to have
   spread still further owing to the Mohammedan conquest, and it gained
   secret adherents among the Mohammedans themselves. The doctrine and
   discipline of the Manich√¶an Church underwent little change in the East,
   it especially did not there approach much nearer the Christian
   religion. But it experienced attempts at reform several times; for, as
   was natural, its "Auditores" readily became secularised. These attempts
   also led temporarily to schisms and the formation of sects. At the
   close of the tenth century, the time when the Fihrist was written, the
   Manich√¶ans had been already expelled from the cities in Mesopotamia and
   Persia, and had withdrawn into the villages. But in Turkestan and up to
   the borders of China, there existed numerous Manich√¶an communities,
   nay, even whole tribes which had adopted the religion of Mani. Probably
   the great Mongolian migrations first put an end to Manich√¶ism in
   Central Asia. But in India, on the coasts of Malabar, there were
   Manich√¶ans even in the fifteenth century, side by side with Thomist
   Christians (see Germann, Die Thomaschristen, 1875). Manichaeism first
   penetrated into the Gr√¶co-Roman Empire about A.D. 280, in the time of
   the Emperor Probus (see Eusebius. Chronicon). If we may hold
   Diocletian's edict against the Manich√¶ans to be genuine, they already
   had a firm footing in the West at the beginning of the fourth century;
   but Eusebius did not know the sect accurately as late as about A.D.
   325. It was only after about A.D. 330 that the religion spread rapidly
   in the Roman Empire. Its adherents were recruited, on the one hand,
   from the ancient Gnostic sects, especially the Marcionites, Manichaeism
   having, besides, strongly influenced the development of the Marcionite
   Churches in the fourth century. On the other hand, it gained followers
   from the great number of the "cultured", who sought for a "rational"
   and yet to some extent Christian, religion, and who had exalted "free
   inquiry"--esp. as regards the O. T.--into a battle-flag. Criticism on
   Catholicism, and polemics, were now the strong point of Manichaeism,
   esp. in the West. It admitted the stumbling-blocks which the O. T.
   presented to every thinker, and gave itself out as a Christianity
   without the O. T. Instead of the subtle Catholic theories about divine
   predestination and human freedom, and the difficult Theodicy, it
   offered an extremely simple conception of sin and goodness. It did not
   preach the doctrine of the incarnation, which was particularly
   repugnant to those who were passing from the ancient cults to the
   Universal Religion. In its rejection of this doctrine, it coincided
   with Neoplatonism. But while the latter, with all its attempts to
   accommodate itself at various points to Christianity, found no formula
   that would introduce into its midst the special veneration of Christ,
   the Western Manich√¶ans succeeded in giving their doctrine a Christian
   colouring. Of the Manich√¶an mythology all that became popular was the
   rigid physical dualism; its barbarous portions were prudently disguised
   as "mysteries"; nay, they were even frankly disavowed here and there by
   the adepts. The farther Manich√¶ism pushed into the West, the more
   Christian and philosophical it became; in Syria it kept itself
   comparatively pure. It found its most numerous adherents in North
   Africa, where it had secret followers even among the clergy; this may
   perhaps be explained by the Semitic origin of a part of the population.
   Augustine was an "Auditor" for nine years, while Faustus was at the
   time the most distinguished Manich√¶an teacher in the West. In his later
   writings against Manich√¶ism Augustine chiefly discusses the following
   problems: (1) the relations of knowledge and faith, reason and
   authority; (2) the nature of good and evil, and the origin of the
   latter; (3) the existence of free-will, and its relation to divine
   omnipotence; (4) the relation of evil in the world to the divine
   government.

   The Christian Byzantine and Roman Emperors from Valens onwards issued
   strict laws against the Manich√¶ans. But at first these bore little
   fruit. The "Auditores" were difficult to detect, and really gave slight
   occasion for a persecution. In Rome itself the doctrine had a large
   following, especially among the scholars and professors, between A.D.
   370 and 440, and it made its way among the mass of the people by means
   of a popular literature, in which even the Apostles played a prominent
   part ("Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles"). Manich√¶ism also experienced
   attempts at reform in the West; but we know little about them. Leo the
   Great, in alliance with the civil power, was the first to adopt active
   measures against Manich√¶ism. Valentinian III. sentenced its adherents
   to banishment, Justinian made the penalty death. It seems to have been
   extinguished in North Africa by the persecution of the Vandals. It
   really died out nowhere else, either in the Byzantine Empire, or in the
   West; for it gave an impulse to the formation of new sects which were
   allied to it in the early part of the Middle Ages. If it has not been
   proved that the Spanish Priscillians had been already influenced by
   Manich√¶ism in the fourth century, still it is undoubted that the
   Paulicians and Bogomilians, as well as the Cathari, are to be traced
   back to it (and Marcionitism). Thus, if not the system of Mani the
   Persian, yet Manich√¶ism modified by Christianity accompanied the
   Catholic Church of the West on into the thirteenth century.

   Literature.--Beausobre, Hist. critique de Manichie et du Manich√©isme, 2
   vols. 1734 sq. Too great prominence is given in this work to the
   Christian elements in Manich√¶ism. Baur, Das manich√§ische
   Religionssystem, 1831. Manich√¶an speculation is here presented
   speculatively. Fl√ºgel, Mani, 1862; an investigation based on the
   Fihrist. Kessler, Unters. z. Genesis des manich. Religionssystems,
   1876; by the same author, "Mani, Manich√§er" in the R.-Encykl. f.
   protest Theol. u. Kirche, 2 Ed., Vol. IX., p. 223-259 ; the account
   given above is based in several of its expositions on this article.
   Kessler has since published a work, "Mani, Forschungen √ºber die manich.
   Relig. Ein Beitrag z. vergleichenden Religionsgeschichte des Orients.
   I. Bd. Voruntersuchungen und Quellen, 1889;" see on this the acute
   reviews of Rahlfs (G√∂tt Gel. Anz. 1889, No. 23), N√∂ldeke (Zeitschrift
   d. deutschen morgenl. Gesellsch. Vol. XLIII., p. 535 ff.) and August
   M√ºller (Theol. Lit.-Ztg., 1890, No. 4). The older accounts may be
   mentioned of Mosheim, Lardner, Walch, and Schr√∂ckh, as also the
   monograph of Trechsel, Ueber Kanon, Kritik und Exegese der Manich√§er,
   1832, and A. Newmann's Introductory Essay on the Manich√¶an heresy,
   1887.

     * Littera: [770]1
     * (1) Christum primogenitum esse et ipsum esse sapientiam dei, per
       quem omnia facta sunt; (2) quod sapientia dei Christus; (3) quod
       Christus idem sit et sermo dei; (4) quod Christus idem manus et
       brachium dei; (5) quod idem angelus et deus; (6) quod deus
       Christus.: [771]1
     * (ligno) deus pependit dominus: [772]1
     * . . . Quia itaque vera scripta sunt (sc. the Holy Scriptures) totum
       hominem in Christo agnoscebam; non corpus tantum hominis, aut cum
       corpore sine mente animam, sed ipsum hominem, non persona
       veritatis, sed magna quadam nature√¶ human√¶ excellentia et
       perfectiore participatione sapienti√¶ pr√¶ferri c√¶teris arbitrabar.
       Alypius autem deum carne indutum ita putabat credi a Catholicis, ut
       pr√¶ter deum et carnem non esset in Christo anima, mentemque hominis
       non existimabat in eo pr√¶dicari . . . Sed postea h√¶reticorum
       Apollinaristarum hunc errorem esse cognoscens, catholic√¶ fidei
       coll√¶tatus et contemperatus est. Ego autem aliquanto posterius
       didicisse me fateor, in eo quod "verbum caro factum est" quomodo
       catholica veritas a Photini falsitate dirimatur.: [773]1
     * . . . sicut et illos, qui superstitiose magis quam religiose, uti
       ne videantur duos deos dicere, neque rursum negare salvatoris
       deitatem, unam eandemque substantiam patris ac filii asseverant, id
       est, duo quidem nomina secundum diversitatem causarum recipientes,
       unam tamen hupostasin: [774]1
     * Amplius nobis profuit culpa quam nocuit: in quo redemptio quidem
       nostra divinum munus invenit. Facta est mihi culpa mea merces
       redemptionis, per quam mihi Christus advenit . . . Fructuosior
       culpa quam innocentia; innocentia arrogantem me fecerat: [775]1
     * Apologia pro apocalypsi et evangelio Johannis apostoli et

     * Auditor: [777]1

     * Aven√¶ vero ill√¶ ubique tunc semen excusserant. Ita altquamdiu per
       hypocrisin subdola vivacitate latitavit, et nunc denuo erupit. Sed
       et denuo eradicabitur, si voluerit dominus.: [784]1
     * Caro dominica a deo patre Jesu vocita est; spiritus sanctus, qui de
       c√¶lo descendit, Christus, id est unctus dei vivi, a deo vocitus
       est, spiritus carni mixtus Jesus Christus: [785]1
     * Catechumeni: [786]1

     * Ceterum Iudaic√¶ fidei ista res, sic unum deum credere, ut filium
       adnumerare ei nolis, et post filium spiritum. Quid enim erit inter
       nos et illos nisi differentia ista? Quod opus evangelii, si non
       exinde pater et filius et spiritus, tres crediti, unum deum
       sistunt?: [788]1
     * Christus Iesus dominus et deus noster ipse est summus sacerdos dei

     * Compellimur h√¶reticorum et blasphemantium vitiis illicita agere,
       ardua scandere, ineffabilia eloqui, inconcessa pr√¶sumere. Et cum
       sola fide explorari, qu√¶ pr√¶cepta sunt, oporteret, adorare scilicet
       patrem et venerari cum eo filium, sancto spiritu abundare, cogimur
       sermonis nostri humilitatem ad ea, qu√¶ inenarrabilia sunt extendere
       et in vitium vitio coarctamur alieno, ut, qu√¶ contineri religione
       mentium oportuisset, nunc in periculum humani eloquii proferantur.:
       [793]1
     * Credo in deo patre omnipotente, invisibili et impassibili: [794]1
     * Cunctos populos, quos clementi√¶ nostr√¶ regit temperamentum, in tali
       volumus religione versari, quam divinum Petrum atostolum tradidisse
       Romanis religio usque ad nunc ab ipso insinuata declarat: [795]1
     * De populo absconso sancto omnipotentis Christi dei vivi: [796]1
     * De summa trinitate et de fide catholica et ut nemo de ea publice
       contendere audeat: [797]1
     * Dic mihi, super quem spiritus sanctus sicut columba descendit? Si
       perfectus erat, si filius erat, si virtus erat, non poterat
       spiritus ingredi, sicut nec regnum potest ingredi intra regnum.
       Cuius autem ei c√¶litus emissa vox testimonium detulit dicens: Hic
       est filius meus dilectus, in quo bene complacui? Dic age nihil
       remoreris, quis ille est, qui parat h√¶c omnia, qui agit universa?
       Responde itane blasphemiam pro ratione impudenter allegas, et
       inferre conaris?: [798]1
     * Diximusne aliquid et sonuimus aliquid dignum deo? Immo vero nihil
       me aliud quam dicere voluisse sentio; si autem dixi, non hoc est
       quod dicere volui. Hoc unde scio, p: [799]1

       canonici appellantur, didici hunc timorem honoremque deferre, ut
       nullum eorum auctorem scribendo aliquid errasse firmissime credam.
       Ac si aliquid in eis offendero litteris, quod videatur contrarium
       veritati, nihil aliud quam vel mendosum esse codicem, vel
       interpretem non assecutum esse quod dictum est, vel me minime
       intellexisse non ambigam.: [802]1
     * Ego vero evangelio non crederem, nisi me catholic√¶ ecclesi√¶
       commoveret auctoritas.: [803]1

     * Emendari: [813]1
     * Epithalamium libellus hic, id est, nuptiale carmen, dramatis in
       modum mihi videtur a Salomone conscriptus, quem cecinit instar
       nubentis spons√¶, et erga sponsum suum, qui est sermo dei, coelesti
       amore flagrantis. Adamavit enim eum, sive anima, qu√¶ ad imaginem
       eius facta est, sive ecclesia.: [814]1

       filius et pater.: [815]1

     * Multa, qu√¶ non inveniuntur in litteris apostolorum neque in
       conciliis posteriorum, et tamen quia per universam custodiuntur
       ecclesiam, non nisi ab ipsis tradita et commendata creduatur.:
       [849]1
     * Multa, qu√¶ universa tenet ecclesia et ob hoc ab apostolis pr√¶cepta
       bene creduntur, quamquam scripta non reperiantur.: [850]1
     * Nec tamen ab hoc mediator est, quia verbum, maxime quippe immortale
       et maxime beatum verbum longe est a mortalibus miseris; sed
       mediator per quod homo.: [851]1
     * Necesse est ut omne peccatum satisfactio aut poena sequatur.:
       [852]1
     * Non est ignorandum pr√¶sentem epistolam esse falsatam, qu√¶ licet
       publicetur non tamen in canone est.: [853]1
     * Nulla res in via (ad deum) tenere nos debet, quando nec ipse
       dominus, in quantum via nostra esse dignatus est, tenere nos
       voluerit, sed transire; ne rebus temporalibus, quamvis ab illo pro
       salute nostra susceptis et gestis, h√¶reamus infirmiter, sed per eas
       potius curramus alacriter etc.: [854]1
     * Patripassiani, Valentiniani, Appelletiani, Ophit√¶, Marcionit√¶ et
       cetere h√¶reticorum pestes: [855]1
     * Placuit ergo, pr√¶sente spiritu sancto et angelis eius: [856]1
     * Placuit nobis spiritu sancto suggerente: [857]1
     * Porro qui eundem patrem dicis et filium, eundem et protulisse ex
       semetipso facis.: [858]1
     * Praxeas quidem h√¶resim introduxit quam Victorinus corroborare
       curavit.: [859]1
     * Prius: [860]1
     * Pr√¶dictus est deus carnaliter nasci pro nobis: [861]1
     * Quare dominus noster carnem induit? Ut ipsa caro victori√¶ gaudia
       gustaret et dona grati√¶ explorata et cognita haberet. Si deus sine
       carne vicisset, qu√¶ ei tribuerentur laudes? Secundo, ut dominus
       noster manifestum faceret, se initio creationis nequaquam ex
       invidia prohibuisse, quominus homo fieret deus, quia maius est,
       quod dominus noster in homine humiliabatur, quam quod in eo, dum
       magnus et gloriosus erat, habitabat. Hinc illud: Ego dixi, dii
       estis'.: [862]1
     * Qui et filius diceris et pater inveniris: [863]1
     * Quid est enim, dices, sermo nisi vox et sonus oris, et sicut
       grammatici tradunt, a√´r offensus, intellegibilis auditu, ceterum
       vanum nescio quid.: [864]1
     * Quis nesciat sanctam scripturam canonicam tam veteris quam novi
       testamenti certis suis terminis contineri, eamque omnibus
       posterioribus episcoporum litteris ita pr√¶poni, ut de illa omnino
       dubitari et disceptari non possit, utrum verum vel utrum rectum
       sit, quidquid in ea scriptum esse constiterit: episcoporum autem
       litteras qu√¶ post confirmatum canonem vel script√¶ sunt vel
       scribuntur, et per sermonem forte sapientiorem cuiuslibet in ea re
       peritioris, et per aliorum episcoporum graviorem auctoritatem
       doctioremque prudentiam et per concilia licere reprehendi, si quid
       in eis forte a veritate deviatum est: et ipsa concilia qu√¶ per
       singulas regiones vel provincias fiunt, plenariorum conciliorum
       auctoritati qu√¶ fiunt ex universo orbe Christiano, sine ullis
       ambagibus cedere: ipsaque plenaria s√¶pe priora posterioribus
       emendari, cum aliquo experimento rerum aperitur quod clausum erat,
       et cognoscitur quod latebat.: [865]1
     * Quisquis in scripturis (I. 37) aliud sentit quam ille qui scripsit,
       illis non mentientibus fallitur; sed tamen, ut dicere coeperam, si
       ea sententia fallitur, qua √¶dificet caritatem, qu√¶ finis pr√¶cepti
       est, ita fallitur ac si quisquam errore deserens viam, eo tamen per
       agrum pergat, quo etiam via illa perducit.: [866]1
     * Quod filius dixit, cum sit deus pristinus ipse: [867]1
     * Quod universa tenet ecclesia, nec conciliis institutum sed semper
       retentum est, non nisi auctoritate apostolica traditum rectissime
       creditur.: [868]1
     * Quomodo poterit vera columba verum hominem ingredi atque in eo
       permanere, caro enim carnem ingredi non potest? sed magis si Iesum
       hominem verum confiteamur, eum vero, qui dicitur, sicut columba,
       Spiritum Sanctum, salva est nobis ratio in utraque. Spiritus enim
       secundum rectam rationem habitat in homine, et descendit et
       permanet et competenter hoc et factum est et fit semper . . .
       Descendit spiritus super hominem dignum se: [869]1
     * Quomodo potuit ista res (the baptism by heretics), tantis
       altercationum nebulis involuta, ad plenarii concilii luculentam
       illustrationem confirmationemque perduci, nisi primo diutius per
       orbis terrarum regiones multis hinc atque hinc disputationibus et
       collationibus episcoporum pertractata constaret?: [870]1
     * Requiter: [871]1
     * Sabelliani et Marcionit√¶ dicunt, quod h√¶c futura sit Christi ad
       deum patrem subjectio, ut in patrem filius refundatur: [872]1
     * Sanctus spiritus, dei filius: [873]1
     * Secundum motum animi mei et spiritus sancti.: [874]1
     * Sed et eos, qui hominem dicunt dominum Iesum pr√¶cognitum et
       pr√¶destinatum, qui ante adventum carnalem substantialiter et
       proprie non exstiterit, sed quod homo natus patris solam in se
       habuerit deitatem, ne illos quidem sine periculo est ecclesi√¶
       numero sociari.: [875]1
     * Sed etsi nulla ratione indagetur, nullo sermone explicetur, verum
       tamen est quod antiquitus veraci fide catholica pr√¶dicatur et
       creditur per ecclesiam totam; qu√¶ filios fidelium nec exorcizaret,
       nec exsufflaret, si non eos de potestate tenebrarum et a principe
       mortis erueret, etc.: [876]1
     * Si enim hominem eum tantummodo ex Maria esse dicis et in baptismate
       spiritum percepisse, ergo per profectum filius videbitur et non per
       naturam. Si tamen tibi concedam dicere, secundum profectum esse
       filium quasi hominem factum, hominem vere esse opinaris, id est,
       qui caro et sanguis sit?: [877]1
     * Si unus deus Christus, Christus autem deus, pater est Christus,
       quia unus deus; si non pater sit Christus, dum et deus filius
       Christus, duo dii contra scripturas introducti videantur.: [878]1
     * Sicut sancti evangelii quattuor libros, sic quattuor concilia
       suscipere et venerari me fateor.: [879]1
     * Simplices quique, ne dixerim imprudentes et idiot√¶, qu√¶ maior
       semper pars credentium est, quoniam et ipsa regula fidei a pluribus
       diis s√¶culi ad unicum et verum deum transfert, non intelligentes
       unicum quidem, sed cum sua oikonomi'a: [880]1
     * Tenebit igitur hunc modum in scripturis canonicis, ut eas qu√¶ ab
       omnibus accipiuntur ecclesiis catholicis, pr√¶ponat eis quas qu√¶dam
       non accipiunt; in iis vero qu√¶ non accipiuntur ab omnibus, pr√¶ponat
       eas, quas plures gravioresque accipiunt eis, quas pauciores
       minorisque auctoritatis ecclesi√¶ tenent. Si autem alias invenerit a
       pluribus, alias a gravioribus haberi, quamquam hoc facile inveniri
       non possit, √¶qualis tamen auctoritatis eas habendas puto.: [881]1
     * Unde deus clamat: Stulte, hac nocte vocaris.: [882]1
     * Unicum deum non alias putat credendum, quem si ipsum eundemque et
       patrem et filium et spiritum s. dicat.: [883]1
     * Universitatis nostr√¶ caro est factus.: [884]1
     * Unus est in c√¶lo deus dei, terr√¶ marisque, Quem Moyses docuit ligno
       pependisse pro nobis: [885]1
     * Ut et filius hominis esset filius dei, naturam in se univers√¶
       carnis assumpsit, per quam effectus vera vitis genus in se univers√¶
       propaginis tenet.: [886]1
     * Ut sic divisos diceremus, quomodo iactitatis, tolerabilius erat,
       duos divisos quam unum deum versipellem pr√¶dicare: [887]1
     * Utinam," says Jerome, "tam nostra confirmare potuisset quam facile
       aliena destruxit.: [888]1
     * Utuntur capitulis scripturarum qu√¶ de Christo veluti de homine
       edocent, qu√¶ autem ut deo dicunt ea vero non accipiunt, legentes et
       nullo modo intellegentes: [889]1
     * Valde perfectos et irreprehensibiles in omnibus eos volebant esse:

       anima. Breviter respondeo, aut ipse est aut ipso anima facta est.

       Qu√¶rendum erat sacrificium, sed quale sacrificium poterat pro
       absolvendis hominibus inveniri? Neque etenim iustum fuit, ut pro
       rationali homine brutorum animalium victim√¶ c√¶derentur . . . Ergo
       requirendus erat homo . . . qui pro hominibus offerri debuisset, ut
       pro rationali creatura rationalis hostia mactaretur. Sed quid quod
       homo sine peccato inveniri non poterat, et oblata pro nobis hostia
       quando nos a peccato inundate potuisset, si ipsa hostia peccati
       contagio non careret? Ergo ut rationalis esset hostia, homo fuerat
       offerendus: ut vero a peccatis mundaret hominem, homo et sine
       peccato. Sed quis esset sine peccato homo, si ex peccati
       commixtione descenderet. Proinde venit propter nos in uterum
       virginis filius dei, ibi pro nobis factus est homo. Sumpta est ab
       illo natura, non culpa. Fecit pro nobis sacrificium, corpus suum
